This was definitely a huge and terrible bug. I would hate to be one of the impacted users here. Johoe kept the coins safe (the "hacker"), and you can read the thread here: 
I think Blockchain.info owes him a huge round of thanks. He did something wonderful when he could've walked off with $100k.
All of that said, Blockchain.info is right. This probably did affect a tiny, tiny portion of their userbase. That's all it was, and odds are, most people are safe. I can understand if your trust is broken, but you should compare this to the amount of Bitcoin they do keep safe. This is a small minority of it on the whole.

I actually just bought a mattress from Tuft and Needle (for Bitcoin) and it came in last night. Granted, I've been sleeping on the floor the past few nights, but it felt pretty comfy. It's the twin Five. I'll be able to give a more informed opinion down the road, but I've been extremely happy with the whole process. I love the Bitcoin checkout, too.
I think like any mattress, it may sleep a bit cooler on a slatted surface (I have mine on the floor right now), and the ten may be a bit comfier yet. 
I bought the rest of my bedding from Overstock for Bitcoin, so I'll have an all Bitcoin bed. I'm pretty happy about that.

Where can I find the service for renting disk space? I've imagined similar things before and I'd love to take a look if it launches.

It actually looks like this is on a shared webhosting service from qhost.com, who uses Limestone Networks. I've notified them as well. qhost.com also takes Bitcoins.

I'm sorry to hear of your loss, but are you really holding 100BTC on Blockchain.info?? That many BTC, unless you're loaded and it's pocket change, really ought to be on a paper wallet.

This is awesome! Are there any explanations to the keyboards? What's a non-angled keyboard like?
I've had DAS and a tenkeyless Coolermaster.

This was pretty brilliant. I am impressed by many of the responses there.
Someone should try this on Omegle and let me know how it turns out.

This is pretty amazing. I've thought of doing something similar, but only in the US.
I was looking at an apartment, put in my application fee, and went for a walk. Had a sandwich and came back to this hole-in-the-wall grocery place. Pretty much open air with some flies around. Found a Bitcoin ATM near checkout. Not even on the map!
Granted this is in Palo Alto, but still incredible.

Not sure if this has been posted yet or not, but here it is: 
Pretty scary stuff.

I hate to split up discussion, but it seems this is worthwhile. I made a duplicate post on I ask that you reply on instead, although you may do whichever you please.

That looks pretty cool. I'm very happy with Breadwallet, but it seems like what you've done is couple an SPV wallet with something something like Venmo, and maybe a bit more. Is that the case?

Amazon doesn't directly take Bitcoin, though. It's another step for the user and the economics of it would be best if the marketplace accepted Bitcoin, paid the seller in Bitcoin, and accepted payment in Bitcoin.

This is strange. I may have the history wrong, but I bought half a motorcycle (may have been the first motorcycle Bitcoin purchase) for Bitcoins... back in 2011.... June? The guy I bought it from, if I'm not mistaken, eventually worked at ODesk which this is now.

That's a shame. It's a great bed, I pretty much paid for everything in Bitcoin between Overstock.com and Tuft and Needle. The checkout was actually probably the best I've used.

I didn't notice much lag. I'm also a complete bomberman newbie.
Did you connect to the nearest region?

If I recall correctly, the T&amp;N checkout was integrated in. You didn't have to leave the site.

Half fiat, half Bitcoin. It was actually a mix of cash and cheque on the money end.

I don't know a lot on this topic, but increasing the block size, especially 20x, may not be a good idea. Can the nodes handle it? Possibly only the big ones. Can we make existing transactions more efficient? I think this is likely. Maybe some day we will need to have a 20MB block size (unless the currency is treated like silver), but I think we have a bit of leg work to go until we get there.

Is that an official form? Do you have the form ID so I can look it up? Pretty awesome, at least in a way, if that is the case.
