I'd rather take ads over actual payments. I can "gloss over" ads.

I wonder how far away till we have "intel quantum" processors in our computers haha.

In my opinion I don't consider ads as a payment system anyway. I get that it's supposed to generate the website money. They're hoping you click on something/buy something. But you're just there for the content that you're looking for. If it was paid for like Netflix/Prime whatever, that's actual expected money. No money, no service.

What do you mean by "massive amount of resources" as in, even if the page you're visiting is done loading, the ads are still taking a long time to load?
Or screen real estate?
I have adblock plus installed on any computer although you did mention mobile which I am not aware of an adblock solution to that. It seems hypocritical being a web developer and being opposed to ads as far as trying to make money from ads as well.

When you say "machine payable web"... if the payment confirmation takes between 6 to 13 minutes... could you run a real time auction site? If the payments take that long to confirm I wonder how you would accept payments/activate things and wait for confirmation. Usually when you buy things online, the results are immediate, you get some product or something is activated. What about bitcoins?

Oh I must have misunderstood what confirmation meant. I thought confirmation meant "payment approved".

You don't mean distributed computing? Aren't servers in general storage? When do people use processing power alone? Parsing something? I'm genuinely asking. 
This is the only system that would allow these "instantaneous transactions" of bitcoins?
Sorry if I am off.

That sucks, that's like Forbes not permitting you to visit their website when they detect that you use am as blocker. Granted, as a person trying to make money from ad revenue myself I understand.
But I've also read about these types of solutions for ad blockers fire back om the website creator. People just don't go there.
I hate those websites where content is split into like 16 section and you have to click an arrow to advance every fourth "slide" is an ad. Although some have the option to see all the content on the current page.

If you don't have any bitcoins/don't have the piece to do a transaction I wonder if you're just redirected out of the site.

Ha... maybe if you ran a junkyard/old computer recycling store and had off-grid power like solar, wind, dam, or you happened to be right on the edge of an ocean. 8cents a day for 24 hours of continuous operation?

You can actually sell that quickly though? If so why don't people make a lot of money that way? Actually if it's increasing you have to figure out when it starts decreasing and are there buyers when you are trying to sell.

I am asking because you can watch in real time the value of bitcoin going up or down. With the banks as you say I'm not aware where to look to see the value of the dollar going up/down in real time. Though I haven't looked for that either. 
Yeah I wouldn't be standing in a factory if I had massive liquidity. Unless it was my own factory.
