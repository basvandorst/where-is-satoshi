Bitcoin. I'm estimating that we have one more spike to 2900 before the downward slope.

If the worst you're doing is " I'm not making as much money as I could have." Then you're doing alright.
@_date: 2017-08-01 08:08:14
That's what we're seeing right now with the 2900. Then the floodgates open in a couple hours. Maybe, I dunno, I'm not a Time Lord.

Worse. I'm stuck at work and can't ride the wave, only watch from the sidelines.
On the plus side I'm up $350. One months payment on my future lambo for doing jack all.

Cryptopia was available last night. Dumped it all on the highest bidder without waiting.
BCH has dropped 50% since then. Feels good, mang.

Just close your eyes and imagine the lambos as you mash BUY BUY BUY.

Different for every one. Coinbase and Cryptopia (the ones I use) are both back online.

If you build a farm in China where electronic components are inexpensive and electricity is cheaper than air, you might in fact be able to eke out a profit after you've paid your bribes to the local government for being a foreign landholder.

I've been using them for a few alt coins. They're small but reliable. I certainly trust New Zealand more than some eastern Euro exchange.
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:58:37
My crystal ball says:
People are holding BTC to earn the "free" BCH, and some exchanges are halting BTC trading, both of which are limiting supply. Would not surprise me to see BTC crash to 1k by noon tomorrow. It won't stay there, but the floodgates will open when everyone starts trading their BTC back out to altcoins.
My analysis: Invest in altcoins if you can. Then just hold on tight and get ready to buy big at the dip.
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:36:54
Thousands, sure. Not millions. There are only ever going to be about 21 million in existence, and people were a lot less careful in keeping them secure when they were worth pennies.

I feel like that scene from Armageddon where they're whipping around the moon at 12 Gs  and everyone's faces are pressed back into their skulls.

The way i understand it is:
Mining is out of reach of anyone but Chinese server farms. The only thing worth mining - and I use the term "worth" loosely here - are new altcoins that you're prepared to hodl for a decade. And you can mine those just fine with a $2k gaming rig. But any crypto actually worth anything is quickly gobbled up by stadium sized farms.

I bought a couple hundred at $2600. This was my first time entering the crypto sphere.  
I bought a couple hundred at $2900.  
I bought a couple hundred at $3200.  
I bought a couple hundred at $3600.  
I bought a couple hundred at $4300. I think that was the highest I ever bought.  
I bought another couple hundred at $3600  
And another couple hundred at $3400  
And I just bought another couple hundred at $3250.  
If it goes back up, so much the better. If it continues to fall for a couple weeks, then I'll just buy more. Let me see that sub $1k bitcoin, and I'll take out a loan to buy even more.

You're comparing BTC to a subreddit that was automatically added to people's follows for years (I think that changed recently). I'm following r/aww, and I don't think I've ever browsed it past what pops up on my front page feed.

I'm curious as to what you would expect to find that hasn't already been discussed in the past 5+ years?
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:15:39
My alts mostly held through the dip. I now have more BTC than when the bloodbath started this morning. My USD value hasn't recovered but I'm at a new BTC all time high.
It's been a good friggin day. When's the next crash?
@_date: 2017-09-14 00:09:58
NXS mooned in the middle of the slaughter, though it's fallen back to normal. I think ARK was still in the green. IOC held its value relative to BTC, and it's up 30% now. Walton/BNB fell about 1% each, WTC is up 12% now.

IIRC, it's a bit complicated and can be used to back up either argument depending on how you twist it. Food and other daily necessities like toilet paper haven't changed all that much, but there was no equivalent to the $700 supercomputer in everyone's back pocket.
Similarly, gas milage for cars hasn't changed much in the last hundred years, but engine efficiency has, which means we've added more safety features and overall weight to the vehicle.

Origin had refunds going for it for the longest time, and I still think they have the superior forum system.
Good Old Games is also a serious contender for those that dislike Steam's DRM policy.
I love me some Steam, but they've been slacking the last couple years, especially in customer service.

Japan hires a bunch of Hollywood actors to endorse products in their tv commercials. That's the closest I can think of.

To compare, you're currently looking at aeronautics in the 1930s.
"Man, the Wright Brothers came up with this great scheme, but look at those amazing airships and reconnaissance planes. I guess its pointless to jump in now since we've already come so far."
We haven't even reached WWII levels of adoption and innovation yet, much less mass consumer flight. We are, to borrow the meme, literally going to the moon.
The only wrong time to jump on the train is "tomorrow."

It's a little on the nose and won't gain widespread appeal. Should have aimed for a direct competitor that could potentially supplant Patreon instead of just being an angry backlash.

1. Opposition leader (BCC) just had an interview on Chinese tv.
2. People are already nervous ahead of Aug 1st.
3. USA is just starting to wake up, which is why there was a dip at 1am, and a second now.
4. BTC was, I personally suspect, sitting on a small bubble. Seemed worth a bit more than the trend would suggest after the roller coaster ride a week or two ago.
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:40:44
Name brand and established userbase, mostly. Same reason most people use Steam for computer gaming even though there are arguably better platforms out there.
Tech geeks rule the world. The more that it gets adopted by Silicon Valley types on an individual level, the more it works its way into their business models, and the faster it grows.
Only thing that could stop it would be massive government regulation, which I would not put past the Federal Reserve.

The news that we appear to have avoided the worst of the BTC/BCC war hasn't filtered around to everyone yet, coupled with the fact that most exchanges are temporarily suspending buying/trading/withdrawals on the 1st.

No one truly knows. Don't trust anyone but yourself, especially those that stand to make money off of your financial decisions. Read all the material you can and decide for yourself.
But I'm personally throwing a couple thousand dollars at this thing and seeing what happens. I have a decent handle on the mechanics behind it, and I see a lot of potential with very few pitfalls. (Though those pitfalls are enormous, namely regulation and government overreach. Big Daddy IRS wants its cut.)
If nothing else, I know how to read a graph.
One day of activity:
Doesn't look too great, since we're entering an area of instability, but we're looking at overall trends. One month of activity:
A bunch of up and down, but not too bad if you don't panic. Still a general upward trend. Let's back out further. Since 2013:
Look at that baby go. I personally suspect we're sitting on a small bubble, and no one knows what BCC is going to do after Aug 1st. But all signs for the moment are rosey.
