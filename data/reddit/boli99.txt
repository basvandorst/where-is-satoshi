There's probably a link to 'coinbase' in the mail that they are hoping you'll click on.
Except, its not really a link to coinbase. So if you clicked it and 'logged in' then you would be giving the bad guys your username and password.

If its your place and you don't pay for power, then technically yes its worth it, however the landlord will spot the crazy power consumption pretty quickly and it likely wont stay free for long after that.

if you have the phrases then you have the coins.
the coins are not 'in your hard drive' - the coins are on the blockchain.
maybe you need to look into 'derivation paths' or something like that.

you either need the password to the wallet, or the wallet recovery phrase.
your wallet creator would have been quite blunt about forcing you to record your wallet recovery phrase. why not hunt for that instead.

Top Tip
If you did something illegal, or believe that you may have possibly caused damage to something you don't own - don't post about it on the internet. That would be dumb.

The better question is, given that its exactly as easy for a bank to move $0.01 as it is for a bank to move $1000000, why do banks charge so much?

where can i find a tool to generate the final word given all the previous words?
@_date: 2018-04-02 19:04:38
We should just all use
"bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon"
It would be easier to remember.
If you're worried that its not secure enough, then you could use
"zebra zebra zebra zebra zebra zebra zebra zebra zebra zebra zebra zebra zebra zebra zebra zebra zebra zebra zebra zebra zebra zebra zebra zebra"
...instead. It's valid too.

i think i found that one already - it bruteforces the last word - which is computationally expensive. I was hoping to calculate it 'properly'

the last word is a checksum. if 'snowball' is one of the BIP39 wordlist, then im sure you can do 23 x 'snowball' and 1 of somethingelse.
