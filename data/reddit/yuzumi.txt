considering it costs more to make a penny than they are worth I don't think its a major loss.
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:40:57
The pennies are probably the cheapest part.

It's half the reason I stopped buying things from Green Man Gaming. They have great deals occasionally, but every time I tried to get something from them I would be hit by the anti-fraud because my bank had the site classified under gambling.

The price, growth, and volatility of bitcoin makes it useless as a currency. Alt-coins are much better at being a currency as they are way more stable.
At this point bitcoin is nothing more than high stakes gambling.

Part of the problem with Bitcoin is that too many people see it like stock.
They buy low and sell high. It contributes to the volatility and does nothing to really help it as a currency.

Considering what Kevin Mitnick went to prison for it isn't outside the realm of possibility that it was something made up to get a harsher sentence. 
Even if they ended up dropping the charges from "lack of evidence" the seed that he might have is still there.

Technically we are already there. The Japanese line is "Over 8,000!" but with the way the lip flaps were "9,000" matched better in English so Goku got a bit of a power bump in the dub.

Why are you still using WEP? That shit is crackable in minutes to *seconds*.
@_date: 2016-02-05 18:57:21
Just checking. I physically recoil every time I hear of someone using WEP.

I know one guy who lives and breaths paypal. He is constantly frustrated that I don't use it when he needs to pay me back for something.
I just tell him that I don't like their practices and that there are *several* cases where they treat their users like criminals and won't budge on anything.
The first time I saw that turned me off paypal was back when hurricane Katrina hit. Something Awful was hosted in a data center down near New Orleans and, since the underground fiber still worked, was saturating the network connections making it hard for people to connect.
So, SA took down the site and put up a temp page explaining the situation with a link to paypal that they would donate for relief efforts.
The response from the SA community was outstanding and they generated a ton of money from all over the world. Then paypal froze the account and wouldn't let any of the money go anywhere.
After trying to go though a bunch of hoops, the guys at SA decided to just refund the money and be done with it because nothing they could do would satisfy paypal, but that also meant that any payments from outside the US would get cut by being converted back into a non-USD currency.

The dollar hasn't been backed by gold for decades. Gold prices is only determined by supply and demand, just like bitcoin.
Fiat is determined by how much is in circulation at any given time. Banks actually loan out more than they have, creating wealth based on debt because few transactions use physical money anymore.

I have to ask: Is there any real reason for this continued increase? It can't last forever and I'd be too afraid of a crash once it stops.
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:11:07
Maybe. I've always been interested on bitcoin, but never have had the money to put into it.

Oh, I'll still buy in when I start my new job, it's just me lamenting I wasn't able to buy.

Yes they do. Because people like you will *blindly* accept any injustices to punish people you deem bad, inhuman, or whatever.
And the key word there is punish. You don't care to help them be better, you just want them to suffer one way or another. You'd rather lock them away forever than give them the help they need to not be that way anymore. Whatever causes someone to be a pedophile, be it something the way their brain is wired or if they were abused themselves as a child, you won't hear of it. They are "bad people" and deserve your own brand of "justice".
The criminal justice system should be there to *rehabilitate* criminals, not keep them locked in a system that drains tax dollars.
Too much of the way criminals are handled in the US do nothing to solve the problem. People are fine with the way things are because "I don't break the law, and if you do you should be punished". People are hanged in the court of public opinion long before trials even start. 
I hope that you are never accused of something like this, because even if you are innocent there will be someone else like you that will just see "dirty pedo" and want you to die, regardless of the evidence.
Now sure, in this case we have evidence, but here's the thing that the majority of the population forgets: Everyone has rights, even criminals. If his rights were violated while collecting that evidence then who's to say your or my rights aren't being violated the same way?
Whether it's pedophiles or terrorism, there is always going to be some boogieman that law makers use to try to erode our rights. This case probably wouldn't even been on anyone's radar if it had nothing to do with pedophilia. Someone is trying to make this judge look bad, despite him doing what he should and upholding the Bill of Rights, and drum up outrage that a "pedo walked free".

It's thoughts like this that erode our rights.

Actually, there is. It's written into the constitution that the government has the legal authority to tax the citizens.
Granted, income tax wasn't a thing until prohibition, but still. Tax is by legal definition not theft. Especially since you benefit from a functioning modern society that couldn't exist without taxes.

I think the distinction  the judge should make is that there is difference between *legal* tinder and money.
You *have* to be able to take legal tinder to settle a debt. You can be willing to settle a debt any way you want you you can trade an item for anything, bitcoin included, but if the person paying is only able or willing to pay in cash it must be taken.
Bitcoin does have monetary value, but you don't have to accept it as a form of payment for anything. I can refuse to sell a TV for cash, but if I loaned it and wanted payment for the debt later I *have* to be willing to take USD in the US. I can deny cards or checks, but I can't deny cash.
Bitcoin is money, but it is not legal tinder. That is the difference.

I'm not going to debate the argument for or against the constitution. It's too late for that and judging by your post history that I glanced though I'm just going to save those brain cells.
My point was that the "Tax is Theft" people, in the US at least, tend to also be the kind that revere the Constitution, or at least The Second Amendment, as essentially Gospel. 
They do also seem to have an issue with the whole "freedom of religion" part though, but that's a different argument.
