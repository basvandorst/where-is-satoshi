The problem is, if you don't understand change addresses you could delete (or forget to back up) an address with money on it. Transferring the full balance does resolve this problem.

True. But the point is that with 1 address your balance becomes public. With a wallet with multiple addresses your balance is unknown.

Paper and brain wallets are an advanced subject. To use them correctly you need to fully understand the bitcoin protocol. For the average user using a normal wallet app with addresses that change after each transaction, what is so hard about someone saying; what is your address? Well my app says 1ctxu... Or, here is by QR code. Point is, with a normal wallet app, it tracks your addresses for you. Your only worry is to back it up so it can be restored.

Pro-Pro-tip: First tell me what you are going to tell me about. Then tell me about it. Then tell me what you told me.

I have found there are a lot of bitcoin ideologists. I don't have a problem with that. The world needs people like these else things like bitcoin may never takeoff. But I think it does prevent a lot of them understanding the mind set of people that do not understand the complicated tech as well as people like us on this subreddit. Even if bitcoin becomes the currency of choice there will still be banks. There will still be a lot of people that trust banks to look after their money for them.

What are you talking about? No one cares what the initial holders beliefs are. If bitcoin does hit the big time there will be a lot of people that do not know how secure a 256 ECDSA prv/pub key is. If they hold a lot of bitcoins they will want to off load the risk of holding them. And guess who they will turn to - a bank. A bitcoin bank could also offer escrow and green addresses. Think of a traditional bank where you get cash out of an ATM and deposit cash in person at the branch. Now imagine a bank where those 2 cash transactions are replaced with bitcoin transactions to/from any wallet you want.

Because you don't know when to stop gambling? Why is Satoshi Dice better/worse than any other gambling site?


Shouldn't that be maximum loss?
Golden rule of gambling. Set yourself a limit and don't chase your losses. Even better consider your buy in as a payment for a nights entertainment and don't expect to win. Any winings is a bonus.

What are you smoking? When you transfer to an address the only checksum relating to the receiving address is the checksum that is part of the address. The only reason that it is there is to make sure you don't type the receiving address incorrectly. I wouldn't call than "revealing a checksum."

Same as cash? What point are you trying to make?


Do they have a monopoly? Serious question. There are other options. I know they are the biggest but i don't know the relative sizes of the exchanges.
I think a lot of people trade there because a lot of people trade there - that's where the action is.
I do agree (at least some of the way) that there is a problem of trust when it comes to open a bank. But i did open an account at mtgox, send them prof of id to become verified. Send a small transaction - just in case. Then go from there. Would this bank be any different?
Ok they haven't got the reputation yet, but some of the exchanges have gone under and there were people that had put their money in them.
