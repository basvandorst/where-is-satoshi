Valid question. This isnt the best forum to ask it at. Try the others that allow comparison pros and cons.

Thanks for saying aka segwit coin. So i know which is which in reference to the $3000 one.  It seems a dead end.

Can they be made illegal? Yes ( violating a code).  But laws you refer to are not real Laws.
Law means that which has been laid down.
In china they make free speech illegal using their corrrupt law.
But in america the law says you have the right to trade and pursue happiness.
Codes cant trump Law because the Law created the gov (with the peoples permission). Thus gov cannot create something higher than itself (it would be against the peoples permission and legally void of authority).
But the gov cheats by using tricks and force.
Thus only gov corporations can make it illegal (not unlawful) by using corporate code (which isnt real Law).
But they force their code on you using threats &amp; force. Which means its unlawful.

Ty. I agree. I stopped posting at this forum because of the banker egos. They are not rich but they think that because they got in btc a year ago, that they are better than us.
The hodlers hold. But they seem to think that if anyone uses btc for another reason ( i.e. trading or shopping), then we are wrong. 
The guy below me proved your point and assumed that new people are here for easy money.
What about educated people who know that fiat will crash, and they want to secure assets in bitcoin?
But noooo, the ego bankers dont critically think.
They yelled at me and told me what to do with my money - because to them i was not buying a high enough amount.
How stupid is that? They chase away small investments to discourage people from using bitcoin (prevent global adoption).
And thats what they did. Pushed me away from the segwit bitcoin. 
Im going to a non banker coin that is friendly to real world uses, even if its in small amounts at a time.
And no one will tell me how to spend my money or give me advice i didnt ask for:  
"go find your own answers." "bitcoin isnt for you." "get out of bitcoin."

I read your article link about BS (bit segwit) vs BC (b cash).
Should i convert my ETH to BC?
@_date: 2017-08-06 10:56:57
Thank you.  The bankers are down voting information.
I see a loophole that allows the bank and gov to crash bitcoin segwit = you loose $3000.
Then banks ask for a bail out.
Gov is happy to use tax money to pay bank.
Bank becomes pawn or partner in crime.
Gov sets condtions that the bank cant let you use your bitcoin segwit unless you pay taxes.
Dead end...
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:22:04
In this territory you must not use bitcoin in vain. Like for daily transactions or to make money on day trading!
You must accept the hodl philosophy, and have faith that we will over come $1000 price drops. 
Praise be to Core and segwit, our heavenly savior.

No offense to you for writing the article. I just think ids are bad. Places like china can use them to restrict free speech. American companies do the same. 
Like nazibook that requires a phone and id to send a message online.  Imagine if you had to show id before you could talk to someone in the street.

Lack of criticial thinking skills and understanding about what a community is for.
You ego bankers are annoying. 
Its like someone asks you if they should buy x on amazon. And you say: "only you can decide to buy x." 
Which isnt the question.  The purpose of asking is so the community can give pros and cons.
This is what happens on amazon.  And buyers use the pros and cons to decide what to do.
But your egos are so bloated that they inhibit your ability to critically think.
He didnt ask you to predict the future.
He asked what to do, and that is based on community knowledge.
E.g. "you should sell now because Y is happening in # months."
Or "Z announced investments into zxyCoin. So the price might go up."
Op might not know about event  which shows why its important to ask at a COMMUNITY.
If 100 people gave real information then we could make better choices based on facts... Instead of your ego answer. 
But if you dont want to contribute to the COMMUNITY then gtfo. Simple concept. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:44:20
Spoiler alert. Btc goes down. Then up higher than before. Thank me later with a donation ☺. I lost my job ��
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:42:12
If everyone was smart we'd help mine for Bcash so it stays alive long enough to sell higher. While we keep btc that will also rise in time. 
Thats what ant or whoever is doing. They are doubling assets and can even yolo it. Because even if bcash fails in a week, it is icing on the cake (to sell off). Theyll still have their matching btc. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:59:42
Stfu. Were you born a pro?
Did he say anything he did wrong? No.
His problem is that coinbase closed his account and he asked why.
He didnt ask for all you ego bankers to yell at him for using coinbase. Maybe hes not euro and couldnt use another one. So stfu with your egos. 
God. We got into btc to get away from egos like yours.  Elitists who have wealth so they think everyone else is beneth them. 
Many people in the community have seen this and are tired of it. If you dont want to help answer then dont post.
But dont use this forum as your bully playground. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:36:48
Gdax also let me withdrawal to a wallet for free. Which surprised me. When i tried 2 weeks ago on coinbase, they were charging $2 in fees.
@_date: 2017-07-01 00:05:03
Lololol. First time ive seen that automated search. Its easy for phone users. Ty. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 10:24:52
Also it may be too late. Coinbase etc are delayed with transfers.
@_date: 2017-07-30 10:23:20
Yes. But you should search old posts for full answers
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:02:57
While you can, take screenshots of you logging in. And each stage of error.  Document how much you had and when.
Did you use tor or change country ip a lot?
They might have flagged for that. Idk. But an idea.
@_date: 2017-07-11 05:00:35
What is the reason for removal? No one ever says anything, so I cant learn the reasons. 
Youtube does the same thing, called ghost ban, where they dont tell you that the public cant see your post.
@_date: 2017-07-26 11:12:59
Why ask why someone asked a question at a question asking place?
These non answers are ridiculous for a community site.
The purpose of a community is to work together. People ask things to get info about things they didnt know or think about.
Basically your answer is: 
"why dont you know or think of everything before you ask a question - but im assuming you know the answer because you gave some info about what you already know. And im ignoring that you gave some info to help the community - so that we can focus on answering then unknown."

The Aug 1 split was avoided by compliance with something in july. 
But some asian miner decided to make his own btc and split on aug 1. And when he gave an interview the price went down. Meaning he has influence. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:36:56
Hmm. The charts show eth only downl. 0.74. But btc down 44.
So thats why im unsure if btc is better.
But i like your hodl advice to buy more at a low ��.
I held my eth for now. But bought some btc.  Dont have much. But it's something as a longer term maturity investment.
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:12:01
My transfer took 20 hours starting yesterday. Go to the bitcoin website and enter your wallet  It will tell you when it transfers. Mine didnt show the transaction for 20 hours. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 09:31:29
Thank you. I wasnt sure which to use.
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:10:41
Well at least you werent rude. :)
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:58:50
Should i convert my eth to btc now? - if you think btc will come out stronger when the fork settles?
@_date: 2017-07-13 07:36:25
Go to transfer tab. I forgot. Enter your new wallet id. Costs about $ 1.50 when i checked
@_date: 2017-07-23 09:07:23
Id like an answer too. Not a link. I dont know what the price fees were at. So cant compare. All i know is they were high. 
Have they gone down? Or will they go doen with the btc updates?
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:16:17
My transaction took 20 hours. I looked up my wallet on the bitcoin website and found theirs. It only had 2 transactions. Which means they are using small wallets to do only a few jobs at a time. 
This would explain the delay. Maybe they make many small wallets for workers to access - to avoid theft.
@_date: 2017-07-23 09:19:09
If people down vote but dont comment. Then how can the community learn about btc. And discuss why it's the better one long term?
@_date: 2017-07-23 09:29:54
I read this forum every night. I have not seen it discused now that btc events have changed. 
My first thread was hidden because i mentioned a coin name. That proves to me that my specific question was not answered before since it's not even allowed to be posted.
Less people know about the currency forum. And they arent btc experts there. Thats why i asked here.
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:23:35
No you have the shitty attitude.
You are assuming he did something wrong. You guys are mad at him for not getting his coins off coinbase.
Some ppl need to use that to get coins in the first place.
Your white knight comment has no effect on me. It only proves to everyone else that you are bad for the community. You get told to stop bullying so you act more like a child, with ego.
Ive been through the same bs from ppl like you ego bankers. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:21:37
Youre too late. Should have transfered 2days ago.
People will yell at you just for using coinbase to buy... But they should only suggest taking coins off the exchange ( so you own the private keys and not the bank).
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:32:22
Thanks coinbase gdax. You get a lot of hate. And my transfer took 20 hours yesterday. 
But at least i know now that you have real funds and let us withdrawal. 
And now it seems you upgraded your service. So thanks for having an easy system to day trade on.
*But verification was hard and took days for first btc buy from the bank.
@_date: 2017-06-25 06:14:20
I dont use your service. But ty for reaching out here.  Its good business.
@_date: 2017-07-31 07:05:18
Oh. Nice luck. Maybe they fixed the delays now ☺. Mine took 20 hours.

Because fiat money is controlled by govs and banks.  People wanted a non gov currency. So demand rose. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:09:22
Sorry i forgot the timing details. I went thru this last month. Was a New user at coinbase.
It was annoying trying to find a fast way to get coins.
For your example its best to buy the coins using the normal bank method, INSTEAD of buying (transfering) USD (to spend at coinbase).
I forgot if its called ACH. But theres bank and credit card methods. 
Both will buy coin at the current price to lock you in. But for bank payment they will bill you now. But you wont get access to your coins for 4-5 days.
So if coinbase says price is $1 and you buy one at $1. Then in 4 days you get 1 coin no matter the price since you already paid.
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:32:09
Please someone do thing for frankenstein.  We must do something to stop the bill (their organized crime).
These retard legislators dont understand the timeless meaning of the 4th amendment.  
They violated oath even proposing it.
They made a public contract to obey the 4th no matter what code they pass.  Which means they cannot vote for a code that "overthrows the government" enacted by the 4th. That is the real federal crime. 18 U.S.C. § 242, 2381.

Why is eth selling off? Its annoying me. Ineed to sell higher
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:27:50
No offense to other people for their advice. But taxes are a scam. You dont lawfully owe money to another person (government) merely because you made money. (I.e. their corporate code is by consent only. It's not real "law.")
Irs taxes is what kings forced people to do.
We got rid of kings and established limited gov that has to agree to enforce OUR rights.
Now the gov might force you. But im saying youre within your right (law) to resist.
So up to you to avoid drama, or fight for your rights and education like i do.
I sent you a pm. Do you know how to check?
@_date: 2017-06-16 01:38:45
Ty. I thought of that But it doesnt make sense. 
 If ppl are buying altcoin with bitcoin, then demand for altcoin goes up, and demand for bitcoin down.
Yet the price for bit and all coins has gone down with a same graph.
Ppl are dumping bit so the price should be going down. And we should see a spike in other coins. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:27:25
You should diversify and invest in making something. A company future related. Like robots, nano battrties, or wearable tech. That way if anything ever happens to btc, youll have plan b. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:57:55
Gdax has usd. You can buy on coinbase. Takes 4 days to receive coins. 
Then login gdax. Same company. You do free transfer from your bitcoin wallet on coinbase to gdax.
Choose deposit. I think.
 Then you can day trade on gdax.
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:46:57
I only have $10 of btc. But i agree. I have $500 eth. I dont understand why btc is making altcoins go down. Ppl should stay in coin market. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 06:10:48
Anything using the bank is slow. Unless you pay an extra fee. (Wire transfer).
Wire takes 24 hours they said.
