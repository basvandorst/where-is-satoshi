No, they didn't. Our lifestyle produces complications and organizations (including central banks) make aggregated choices on our behalf.
However, as technology and consciousness progresses: Things have to fall apart. We reached peak centralization after a 5 to 10k years rise from **disconnected tribal decentralization** to **dependent corporates and states centralization (debt monopol)**. Now we are heading back to **connected community decentralization**.
Centralization played a very important role in the overall progress of humanity. As a by-product it also produced a lot of pain and harm.

counter-argument is resilience. there's no need for 1000+ cryptos. but at least one or two maybe five to ten back-up cryptos will form an interconnected ecosystem (if the free market = nature decides).
monopoly is not a natural force!

I think you overestimate the value of a global currency in a digital world (your perspective seems to be formed by former experience, not by assumed usefulness in the future!)
No time to hurry or fight over who is right. I guess we'll find out in some decades from now.

I wish I could point you onto something. But it's just the tip of the iceberg we are currently exploring. I read a lot over the last 5 years in many different fields. But no book has brought together different streams of thought on this topic, yet. Maybe I have to start a community project to write an open-book about it.
Up until the internet became a thing of the public (20 years ago) it was the most efficient and best way to organize ourselves in hierarchical (read pyramid) structures. Nothing wrong about that. Nobody to blame. It just becomes awkward if we as a society want things to change by keeping them the same. I see "connected community decentralization"  as a natural force (tidal wave) and nobody is capable of stopping it - maybe delaying it a little bit for personal profit.
The old paradigm comes to an end (quickly). Hence we currently witness the transition phase, which gets things shaked up alongside the road.
Nothing to fear. Just a remarkable time to be alive. Observing a new chapter in human history is totally dependent on your perspective. It can be a wonderful thing to see more and more people coming to live again (wake up and take responsibility) or it can be absolute hell if you (your identity) hold on to the old structures that will fall apart in such a sustained way only few can imagine the scope lying ahead of us.
Do you have experience in this field? Do you want to help me write about it?

I agree that it seems this way. Took a long time for most people to look behind the curtains of who pulls the strings in a capitalist world. Too many fairytales and propaganda and bribing ofc.
Now we enter phase two. Self-realization. Power over others is always build on a high degree of illusion (fear, distraction, delusion,...). Once the house of cards becomes obvious it is already too late to repair it. This is why I think we'll see forces of all kind working it out soon (war, civil war, peaceful revolution, elite vs. elite, cvilians vs. civilians, elite vs. elite). But in the end it's us against us. If we realize this sooner rather than later - future looks bright. If not, there's a lot of learning (empathy, compassion, suffering) ahead for us.

They (always) do. I described the bigger cycle.
It's not about globalism vs. localism. It's more about exploring (net-)working structures.
It's also not about centralization vs. decentralization. Both have their strength and weaknesses. It's about fitting them together in the bigger puzzle.
However, starting from today - it will feel like a move from centralization to decentralization.

The Bitcoin revolution (I still remember) started with actual P2P transactions on the streets in bars and cafes. Not feasible anymore. Relying on centralized institutions is not progress. It's failure in we have to face it now, if we don't want to kill Bitcoin.
Lightning might be great but we have no proof it will solve all of todays problems. Just as we see segwit adoption stagnating at ~10%, Lightning may have similar problems getting on track.

* This is a decentralized system. Stop appealing to the centralized entity that Coinbase is.
* Accept that earlier actions (not compromising on Segwit2x) determines todays consequences.
* Don't be ridiculous. Stand up to the settlement version of Bitcoin and improve usability. Make Lightning a reality, build another Coinbase, start a mining company but do something - start competing! Waiting for future riches won't make you rich. It'll make you poor since scaling is not a theoretical debate anymore - but a race. Winner takes it all. Andreas is right. There will only be one or two major PoW systems on this planet.
**As a large BTC investor I look at divesting, because whining about competition and waiting for future riches seems bigger in this community than performing. /rant**

**Unfortunately/luckily "richness" is a state of mind.**
No number on a bank account nor the number of bits you control through a private key can make you feel rich. The same is at least partially true for "poorness".
It's indeed a tragedy that unfolded in front of your families eyes. I appreciate your outreach to this community and your helping hand. We're all in this together.

* Segwit could have been a HF (resulting in 100% adoption from day one).
* Segwit could have been introduced when fees were low and conversion to segwit addresses would have been cheap.
* The blocksize/weight can could have been kicked down the road one more time to give room to breath.
**Face it. Each and every (non-)action has consequences. Some intended, some unintended. In a decentralized system no entity has power over an other. Respect this design principal and use the ability to build your own destiny. Coinbase may never update to segwit adresses. So be it. And nobody has any power over it. They run their own node.**
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:02:52

**tl:dr; It's neither good nor bad. It's simply a tool to handle transaction costs pre-blockchain and therefore a thing of the past.**
Read this: 
A merger makes sense, when transactional costs in the market are higher than in the organization itself.
Blockchain tech reduces external transactional costs and therefore is a force for decentralization.
Blythe is caught in her thinking. She will not realize that mergers are a thing of the past. Only few people will use them, when they provide services everybody else (compare OpenBazaar - Ebay) is able to provide without beeing data-mined.
Let's focus on providing decentralized privacy oriented solutions instead. This is what makes Bitcoin unique.

Like Peter, I would love to see much more decentralization in society, than we have today. Luckily, decentralization is the natural movement (correction) of our time.
But Peter is a decentralization-maximalist. And that's not something that's sustainable. Nature is not either or, but looking for a good equilibrium. Even Satoshi told us, that nodes will become server farms - and he diddn't seem to have a problem with it.

You are referring to the miner perspective only. But there also is the user/participant perspective.
The economy is heading for zero-marginal cost. In the bitcoin (fee)market case, I can even envision a negative-marginal cost, as minig becomes ubiquitous (e.g. "21").
@_date: 2015-06-18 07:31:41
welcome to the political era of bitcoin. conflict of interest is the reason why politicians are paid by the state. the difference between politics and bitcoin is, that the politicians (core devs and others) can not enforce, what they provide as solution. the power stays in the hand of the users.

Of course it is a bad idea out of the perspective of government (decision makers = miners). But the opposition (in this case users) want to govern to.

Although, we [the Bitcoin community] are not free of this social behaviour either. Just look at Gox. How many people signed up with them just because they "where" the biggest exchange at that time. 
Do you hear any good from PayPal these days?
Nevertheless give it a try  :)

This is a must read for all the Bitcoin enthusiasts and evangelists, who ask what they can do to promote/propagate Bitcoin!
Keep in mind. By doing so. In many cases they even harm the community and development of Bitcoin more than they actually help!
**Don't propagate. Don't promote. Simply talk about why you are interested in Blockchain-tech. People like to and will find out things for their own!**
At the very least mention the obvious - Bitcoin!

You should also take into account, that bitcoin users are more privacy aware than "normal" users. The fact, that you ask for an email, which is not necessary might have discouraged some of your "new" won bitcoin spenders (who might have been spenders via PayPal or credit cards before - but for privacy reasons turned to bitcoin)! 
Why would I use bitcoin if it's not for the privacy. If I decided to use bitcoin in first place and then see myself stopped, because I have to offer you my email adress. I would not go back and use your other payment offers.

Be sure I shifted a lot of coins before, as I am monitoring the market for quite a while. Still I had a reasonable amount of $ in my GOX account. But yes, you are right.

He is right. Give it some time. We are not in a hurry.
If Bitcoin serves some needs or (at one point) is simply better than the money/system we use today. It will fold out. There will be nothing to HODL it back. At one point people will be sucked in - no matter what.

money provides certain information for societies (as a medium of exchange). you might have noticed, that -  at least sometimes - humans act illogical.

**But**: As a long time bitcoin lurker, I am comfortable with microtipping. People outside this sub sometimes never have heared of it before and this is why a tip has to make an impact for them! 
@_date: 2015-05-25 15:10:36
The only one, yes. I think there are indeed some valid arguments for a sensible small blocksizelimit. But 1MB is definitely to small even for &lt;1 year scenarios. The Lightning guys speak of 130MB in a possible future, where payment channels are the main vehicle for transactions. 20MB would be a huge step in this direction and would give bitcoin 5 more years of solid development (even partially going mainstream). We have to face, that there currently are only a handful (not interconnected) offchain solutions (=central point of failures). Price is very well suppressed for a long time now. If it starts to turn up slightly again, we will feel an urgent pressure to increase the blocksizelimit anyway. At the current stage bitcoin is not about the fees, but the mining reward. And this won't change that fast (maybe in 10 to 15 years).
**There is no ultimative goal in decentralizing everything.** It's all about a good equilibrium (balance). We should take the risk of near-term centralization, if it a) helps our overall goal of decentralization the money(supply) and b) long-term goal of decentralisation of the nodes (again) after having a working paymentchannel network.

**Relevance needs control.**
States can regulate anything they want. No matter if it is relevant for humanity/evolution.
For example they could regulate how much oxygen a human beeing may breath each day. It's simply the opposite of how much carbondioxide one person emits. In no way it is odd. But relevance is only given, if there is also control.
Is there control over bitcoin? So far I don't think so. Does it harm then? No, because it is not relevant.
This is one of the beauties of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:26:45
Hey, your welcome. While learning about Bitcoin - keep in mind: Money (value) is just a shared illusion. With any doubt a very powerful one. 
 use:
* Always keep a part for yourself.
* Give a (not to small) proportion with joy.
* Be thankful if one gives back to you.

Same here. I already have a 2 TB drive dedicated for the blockchain, waiting to get filled.
If we stay at the 1MB level:
*6MB/h x 24h x 365d = 53 GB/year*
That's more than 30 years until my HDD gets filled. Can't believe we are still discussing this.
I know it's not only about storage, but with pruning enabled we can (and should) do better, even if it causes short-term centralization.
**Bitcoin is in its infancy. It doesn't have to run perfect now nor in the next 5 years.** Please take into account long-time developments when talking about a good equilibrium (balance) between centralization and decentralization/distribution.

Bitcoins "Killer App" as many would refer to it, is **B2B** (especially international B2B)
**In other words:** "Focus on on your strength". As vital as pseudonymity is, (for now) its strength is definitely NOT consumer transactions in the developed world. As a start-up make it easy as pie for international companies to settle in bitcoin (competitive advantage will do the rest).

I like the idea.
The blocksize debate is in it's essence a political one (limited by [technical] ressources). 
* First you try very hard to get consensus. 
* If not possible you try for consent.
* If still not possible the majority will decide.
After that either both forks coexist or one fork will be the new (or old!) path.
@_date: 2014-12-10 13:11:06
it's not about you specifically. We (as a community) heared to much stories, that turned out false afterwards.

Bitcoin as a settlemnt layer could (if no competition takes its place) work well with $100+ transaction fees. LN will come with or without SegWit anyways.
I like that the market has now several proposals to choose from. SegWit and BU are just two of them. We might see more in the future. For now the market decides, that these solutions are not sufficient or urgent enough. That's fine with me.
BTW: I'll bet we see both much bigger blocks and SegWit/Flexible Transactions within 2 years.

It's the other way round. Other cryptos can easily compete with Bitcoin if fees  become to high! People will route around Bitcoin  finding cheaper alternatives...

Agree in general.
Pantera is not only invested in the companies, but (afaik) bitcoin itself. Bitcoins reputation might suffer heavily, if Bitstamp fails. Therfore it could be the right decision to safe Bitstamp (in case they need it!) and profit through higher valuation of bitcoin holdings later on. The market is at a turning point atm. Either way is possible. So their decision could have huge impact on the overall success of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-04 08:29:48
the same is true for SegWit.
IMO 50% of the network resisting both SegWit and Unlimited is a very good sign for its immutability.

Don't agree. I think it is relevant for this forum, if the second biggest cryptocurrency has some possible fork going on, this will have **consequences** for Bitcoin as well. 
* Bitcoin consensus might be seen as more robust.
* Traders might sell ripples in favor of bitcoins.
* Banks might rethink there engagement in ripple.

@_date: 2015-01-08 15:53:44
Why are you sharing the same opinion on Pantera and Bitstamp in every thread? I read about your personal view at least two times this day in different posts.
I don't agree with you. Bitstamp if taking the right direction (and necessary development as outlined above) is still a crown-jewel in their portfolio, even if it costs them another 5 or 10 millions. The overall effect/perception of Bitstamp/the Industry solving this problem without external help will be such a positive one, it will influence market sentiment and therfore Panteras future gains. Consider also, that since the fall of Mt.Gox, Bitstamp ist the best known exchange, with much media attention through the hack, and maybe even more, if the hack will be solved without harming anybody!

There could have been a hard fork to 2 or 4mb literally years ago. And SegWit would have been adopted already. Both sides have legitimate concerns. As long as we don't recognize this there will be stagnation for good in the ecosystem.

Everybody should watch this video. 
What we have to achieve in the next (maybe 5 to 10 years) is 130MB blocks every 10 minutes. That is pretty much the standard in every bigger city today and will be met by most parts of the world via mobile connections, too.

AFAIK miners are still free to choose the software they want to run and tweak the code and recompile for themselves.
IMO Bitcoin was as political as anything on earth can get from day one. So I am not astonished, that politics and influence is now a big thing in Bitcoin land. Bitcoin is about to change the world - how couldn't it be politicized if it's such a powerful tool?

The pleasure was also on my side! At least it shows me that there are intelligent people (just) disagreeing on some matters and agreeing on others.
Foolish would be to think oneself is always right as well as the other side is always wrong. In the end - as you describe it - it's a marathon and far beyond. It will take a long wind (and maybe many different leaders) to make Bitcoin a real success story.

true. so either miners think the economic majority is not in favour of one or the other or are waiting for another proposal. otherwise they would have acted already.

I sincerley hope, that afterwards we all can say we learned something in the process. I don't care which party wins as I only see losers in an intra-community fight. In the end I'd like to see curiosity (win) in others development work (like we have seen in the early days of Bitcoin and now more so In Ethereum).

afaik - there's no solution to decentralize payment channels. and thru scale of economics they even have a centralization effect. big banking hubs will have more connections and operate cheaper. how that is better than mining centralization is still to be explained to me.

I haven't met a person that really understands (what) Bitcoin (is). Have you? Do you know about the future implications?
I guess we agree, that there is more to Bitcoin, than the technical perspective. And we maybe also agree, that Bitcoin became too fast too big. It's the early adopter dilemma, that you want to prove your foresight to the outside world and at the same time endanger your investment (be it financial, emotional or philosophical). What came short in the discussion IMO was the economical perspective. And it is no secret that this perspective is mainly put forward by the part of the community that left or had to leave.
It's the mother of conflict of our digital age. Technician/programmer vs. salesman/business administrators. Both are necessary to survive long-term.

and btw: what you see is that the economic majority may even shift to another crypto currency. that's the (real) power of decentralization. like waves it flows from fiat to bitcoin and from bitcoin (while in trouble) to altcoins and once trouble arises there again back to bitcoin.

You seem to be sure, that two coins will be tradeable in the future.
I'm not so sure about that. IMO Bitcoin is constructed to stay unified as far as possible.
You seem to be sure, that all exchanges agree to not list BTC-C and BTC-U leaving a lot of profit on the table for the first mover exchange that breaks the "contract".
I am not so sure about that. Humans are greedy.
You seem to be sure, that replay protection has to be implemented before the event and on the side of BTC-U only.
I am not so sure about that. Especially if miner majority goes with BTC-U.

Guys some centralization effects will always occur on either path. Some of them will be easily countered thru market forces. When commoditization takes place AND competition is still a thing miner centralization will not be the biggest centralization risk any more. It's up to us to quantify certain centralization risks. But any approach will have these. It's not core all decentralized and bigger blocks all centralized. I hope most people in here can acknowledge that.

Only a good idea if competition is not prohibited by a hard limit. The market will find an efficient equilibrium between 1st layer and 2nd layer.
If Bitcoin would be the only crypto currency, I would agree. But because it is open source software other cryptos can compete easily with a crippled Bitcoin. And with rising market shares, they get their own network effect and ever better security.
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:19:12
why not help the BU or Classic team to make your brilliant thoughts a reality. Decentralization needs self-awareness and action.
@_date: 2017-03-22 11:38:21
Core's scenario is, that everybody can operate their own node for $50 a year, but not afford to open one or more  payment channels for $100+ each. So only big hubs (aka banks) will be able to afford this and provide their KYC channels.
I don't get why people can not see, that we (the market) should find the equilibrium between node operating costs and transaction costs (which directly effect PC costs).

I totally agree with you. IMO there are reasonable people and (honest) miners on both sides. Everybody knows, that we're in this together even if we don't like it.

@_date: 2017-03-28 20:08:05
great but it doesn't solve power concentration. if i read it right cross chain payments will make the problem of hub centralization even more urgent.
if at all current miner monopolies across chains are more decentralized than a potential cross chain hub system, where the future google et al. dominate the scene.
imo we have to find the right balance between off-chain and on-chain scaling. otherwise power will flock to only one side.
Core is too much on one side, while BU is probably too much on the other side. But that's only one level of observation. And I'd like to add that excluding altcoins from the observation is imo a big mistake.
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:50:25
are you saying here because it only split after twelve months of testing it is okay?

That would be a great argument if these people then were able to afford on-chain transactions. But with fees of $1+ to open a payment channel this is not going to happen.

Thanks for your level headed response. I do like the approach of Gesell. And I think economics is about experimenting and combining/applying different thought schools and approaches to reality. "Freigeld" seems to work well in smaller communities, where everybody knows each other. Could go more into detail here. All I am saying is: There's not one approach that fits all. Currency competition and austrian economics might be the best approach for global, anonymous, trustless money. Freigeld might be the best approach for smaller communities built around trust, social well-being and qualitative consume!

I agree with you on some points (economic majority will keep status quo or fork to SegWit and later 1MB+ or 1MB+ and SegWit following suit.
But you seem to miss, that after Poloniex started trading ETH/ETC all other exchanges had to follow suit. Even if they stated otherwise before the event.
There are node farms operated on Core (e.g. BTCC with 100 nodes and others because of business reasons). I count them as one node farm one vote.
There are a lot of listening nodes, but they don't construct consensus. They follow consensus and will have to change if they want to stay usable after a fork. Nothing wrong with that.

AFAIK there are certain companies (e.g. BTCC) that operate 100 Core nodes alone. Do we actually have a scientific method to count real nodes (and not node farms) which are the current backbone of the Bitcoin economy. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:28:38

@_date: 2016-03-21 14:32:59
 don't know. - I guess to know we'll have to figure it out. I am heavily invested in Bitcoin, because I see it as a huge opportunity for mankind. I am one of these persons who would rather see his investment fail, than missing the next evolutionary step. If you don't try small time and fail and get up and fail and get up again, the chances to fail big time become much bigger.
I take huge risks being invested in Bitcoin. And I want to see Bitcoin taking the same big risks in order to progress.
Conclusion: Fear of loss (in every way - investment, reputation, fame, adoption) dominates the current stage of Bitcoin users life. 
 - disruption becomes stronger, the more you fight against it. Be a guiding light - everything else will (anyway) be seen as censorship and manipulation. To withstand a phase of conflict, is what makes communities powerful.
Don't you agree, that decentralizing development is a goal we should aim for. Why is decentralization good, when it comes to nodes and mining, but not so if we talk about different development teams or a diverse crypto-currency ecosystem?
BTW: I think it was not Mike's but et al. effort to see development teams popping up everywhere and alt-coins gaining market share and reputation.
Never was more bullish for the whole crypto-ecosystem.

There are more than just one or two hand-picked centralization effects in a complex world!
We need to take all centralization effects into account when going for a solution and leaving the status quo behind. Just as democracy which may be the worst form to govern but still the best we know. Competition may lead to some centralization, but still it is the most important tool to break up power concentration - again and again and again.
solution 0: 1st layer without (reasonably) growing blocksize and with limited 2nd layer support (status quo)
solution 1: 1st layer without (reasonably) growing blocksize 'now' but full 2nd layer support (Core)
solution 3: 1st layer with (reasonably) growing blocksize and 2nd layer support 'later' (BU)
solution 4:  1st layer with (reasonably) growing blocksize and full 2nd layer support now (BU+SegWit/Core+)

@_date: 2016-03-21 14:58:23
I agree with most of what you describe here. However, I am not sure if BIP 101 would indeed have been suicidal, as miners effectively control the blocksize. And investors control the price hence the miners. But in any case  it's good to have a hard fight over every argument on both sides.
This attitude is what I like to see in a project like Bitcoin, that (cl)aims to be a money/freedom (r)evolution.


In the end no one knows what is right for Bitcoin or the world. And it is the first step (for collaboration) to acknwoledge that.
At lies &amp; misinformation == this is how TPTB steer the masses. Why should it be different in Bitcoin? Why should it be different on both sides of the gaming table. Can't you see how all your criticism can be applied on this forum as well?
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:10:53
**Everybody in here knows that Bitcoin Unlimited is not really unlimited. Just as Bitcoin Core is not as centralized as its name implies.**
So IMO the ground for a realistic approach lies between both. Neither SegWit in its current form which you doubtfully pointed out "as realistic" won't reach majority nor will BU.
Maybe the BU team should implement SegWit and/or Core should implement a reasonable increase (e.g. think about Adam's 2-4-8) to which BU will adapt intuitively. To mitigate the risks of a SF especially with SegWit I'd like to see it implemented as a HF (which is in no way more dangerous than UASF if it is supported by all sides).

It only is if block size is kept at 1MB and no other crypto takes over. In that scenario on-chain fees would become so high that normal users would be totally priced out - even from opening and closing payment channels! Decentralization? Not so much.
Payment channels are a wonderful innovation. They'll be implemented soon after the 1MB limit is lifted.

Now if we could just talk reasonable about how Bitcoin can successfully progress (without being hindered) reaching its full potential. That would be great.
IMO we need both bigger block sizes as well as LN asap. All we are doing while in-fighting and censoring is making ourselves irrelevant. Irrelevant to 99,9% of the potential users outside of our little ecosystem - which will look for solutions when the financial system comes down the next time.
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:30:48
Thanks for your reply. I'm not bitter because of my investment that went better than expected. However I identify myself a Bitcoiner more than an altcoiner. So I am in a kind of identity crisis.
I couldn't care less if Bitcoin gets its shit together or not money wise - still I care because I love the concept of Bitcoin and I love the story of its creation.
You make big claims but don't understand the game theory that lets Bitcoin function. If the miners would announce to change the coin limit I would immediacy divest from Bitcoin. So no need for my node to block their decision. Rather a cause to stop contributing to the network.
Man it's not the nodes that keep miners in check it's the investors!
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:38:04

I think there is no no one who understands Bitcoin from the get go. It took me 7 years to understand what other people don't understand about Bitcoin - the block size debate was an eye-opener in this regard. It's an ongoing process and I know, that I still don't know many things.
Ofc nodes can reject blocks from the majority chain - I can do this today and fork my node off the network. I'd also call it stupid. If I wouldn't agree with what miners do I'd divest from Bitcoin. As easy as this. (Un)fortunately Bitcoin divested me from it by itself by underperfoming against my hedges.

They want both - just not in the packaged form provided by Core. That's what the market states.

if LN competes well with bigger blocks we may not see blocks &gt;20MB by then even if it was unrestricted.

you do not know, that FT is developed by Bitcoin Classic not BU?
@_date: 2017-03-29 06:10:49
BU has no activation time. It's based on rationality. Once &gt;75% of the network signal for bigger blocks it's safe to fork. If any miner produces a larger block before that time it likely gets orphaned. Because in that case the minority has no chance to survive besides you put enormous effort in to keep it alive. But at the same time trading will also start and it'l show us how the economic majority thinks.
@_date: 2017-03-22 11:41:40
not if it can go hand in hand and it's basically about monopoly (current state) vs. competition. Make the block size determined by the market and the market will enforce improvements and competition.
I'd like to see:
1. on-chain increase
2. on-chain improvements
3. off-chain competition

@_date: 2017-02-14 07:21:33
as long as transaction fees go up - everything seems fine. But the moment fees go significantly down again. We can conclude that Bitcoin was routed around. This is the time you want to be invested in some major altcoins even if you've been a former Bitcoin maximalist.
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:31:46
no matter how often you repeat this bullshit - it's not true.
Bitcoin was designed that way. It was always meant to represent the majority of hashes because that is the most difficult thing to fake. Miners are the ones with the most skin in the game; which means they act accordingly in the interest of the economic majority or otherwise fork themselves off the network.
IMO acting in the interest of the EM means enabling bigger blocks (highest priority) to not lose more market share to alts. And enabling second layer tech immediatly after that (high priority) in order to bring Bitcoin to the masses.
@_date: 2017-03-30 17:38:07
If they do this they basically create an altcoin based on the same ledger. Nothing wrong with that.
And if the support is big enough they may even reclaim the name Bitcoin - if markets had their voice heared.
@_date: 2017-03-06 13:57:59
because this conflict is about power and not about common sense.
@_date: 2017-03-12 14:54:46
most people in here got into Bitcoin post 2012. Some of them do not understand the main incentives that make Bitcoin work.
@_date: 2017-03-28 19:58:28
not if they user smaller, but less (still sufficiently) secure altcoins.
so you say either thru bigger blocks or thru LN, Bitcoin will become big business banking chain.
@_date: 2017-03-29 19:29:45
Maybe true. Maybe not.
* Blockstream a proxy for western power grip (read Bilderberg Group vis AXA; Clinton Initiative via Bitfury).
* Bitmain a proxy for eastern power grip (read PBOC).

@_date: 2017-03-29 06:37:10
"Node consensus" seems not what Bitcoin is about. Why do you think we need miners in that case?
BTW- I'd like to trade UASF vs. BTC asap. Can you make it happen, please? The sooner the better!
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:14:27
at the same time you want to spend &gt;$1 per transaction. Makes sense.

stop complaining. start mining.
BTW: I don't trust technical experts with economic questions.

Bitcoin came a long way from building a circular economy within Bitcoin. Now we're talking about the support of "important" (aka centralized) infrastructure (e.g. exchanges, payment provider,..).

@_date: 2017-03-28 19:18:33
@_date: 2017-03-29 17:15:06
I'm not sure about support. There is user and business support for both short-term solutions (forks). Each solution needs to be complimented for Bitcoin to succeed.
I can not see where miners would ruin their long time success over short term gains. If we see SegWit first we'll need bigger blocksizes asap. If wee see bigger blocks first we need SegWit asap.
I agree with you however, that miners (out of self-interest) should not produce SegWit/1MB+ blocks before they reach a certain threshold of around 75%.

Yes, but at a fixed price - OTC. Did you even read the article?
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:09:30
now people actually get that it always was the investors who have the say. miners are just executing the will of the investors.
@_date: 2017-03-29 17:49:50
Some companies exist for a pretty long time in the short-lived Bitcoin space. So all I say is Core is the current backbone and I expect every major Bitcoin company to run at least (!) 10 nodes. But that is not an argument per se.
Look at Adobe Flash. Just because 99% of all computers have Flash (you might even call it a former industry standard) installed doesn't mean that the majority of users are happy with it.

Very interesting.
However TPTB position themselves on both sides of the conflict (divide et impera); compare it with republicans vs. democrats.
In Bitcoin it is Gavin Andresen, CIA, Craig Wright on one side and Blockstream, AXA, PwC, Eric Schmidt, Bilderberg on the other.
At least you are "free" to choose your master!

@_date: 2017-03-06 22:32:16

Soon after the activation of BU we'll head for 2nd layer implementations - hopefully united.

Great to see you fight more and more wind mills.

**Good luck modern day Don Quixote!**
@_date: 2017-01-19 14:24:44
I think there's still room for more decentralization to take place in the developers space.
However we should acknowledge, that shifting ones mind needs time. And so does decentralization. In the meanwhile be respectful with all community members no matter their (personal) views. You never know how your current opinion/perspective may shift in the future.
@_date: 2016-06-27 17:12:48

Why? I am fine with the status quo.
@_date: 2017-01-30 13:32:23
True and according to the stats: it's the majority (aka &gt;50%).
@_date: 2017-01-27 08:44:16
Don't you think we basically create an alt-coin, if we drive block sizes against zero!? What's stopping us from proposing a block size of 10k for even better decentralization?
I would be very careful introducing 2nd layer tech without a significant block size increase. Because: unintended consequences!
@_date: 2017-01-27 08:34:55
this is the reason, why a market based approach should be considered.
@_date: 2017-01-30 13:40:06
Should I not be free to choose the software/code I run on my own node?
Edit: I get your point, that in choosing so I could harm myself and that would probably be a silly move. But people in general do stupid things. Bitcoin Core can not prevent this.
Conclusion: if the network is not capable of handling "stupid things" (from some ones perspective) it should not be worth $15B+.

@_date: 2017-08-03 07:49:33
We can have both. Conflict is a healthy thing and makes Bitcoin (Core+Cash) vastly more valuable than any other coin without a dialectic conflict.
People still think conflict is something bad, when it's actually a main driver for comeptition and progress.
I have my stakes in both Bitcoin variants and couldn't be more happy about it. **It's like a first row seat on two missions to the moon at the same time! That's fucking amazing!!!**

Do you know why BU came to life in the first place?
@_date: 2017-01-19 10:33:59
Let's be honest here:
* Users not interested in decentralization. (see node count)
* Developers not interested in decentralization. (see hostile development enviroment)
* Miners not interested in decentralization. (look no further than China)
* Traders not interested in decentralization (see volume of Bitsquare)
**Conclusion**: All of us are accustomed to centralization. We look up to people of fame, leaders of any kind (good &amp; bad), certain authorities and experts. *It's our mind that has to shift in order for Bitcoin to become successful.*
@_date: 2017-01-16 17:23:19
I do share some of your experience. I am not an engineer, however. Still I don't see how this applies to Bitcoin. Decentralization as in  Bitcoin redefines the decision making process. But more important seems to me, that decentralization makes both sides heared. And that is in stark contrast to the above sketch where people euphorically delude themselves into a non solvable pseudo-solution.
@_date: 2017-01-28 08:06:05
So stagnation. That's fine with me (and probably everyone sufficiently hedged).
@_date: 2017-01-30 18:11:04
is there a way to prove this? am very interested.
@_date: 2017-01-19 08:05:07
maybe it won't go to 10k then. Have you thought about this?
@_date: 2017-01-16 11:58:17
Tell me: Do 'expert' developers decide for node owners, miners and investors where and how to invest their money?
If not. Should developers take care of investors choices?
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:35:32
You do not want companies, you do want individuals to mine the coins. However we are far off this goal.
I'm pro Bitcoin Core as I'm pro Bitcoin Cash. There are three cabals right now. I support all of them, as I think open competition is a good thing.
* Bitcoin Core &amp; Blockstream (supported by western PTB)
* Bitcoin Segwit2x &amp; DCG (supported by western PTB)
* Bitcoin Cash &amp; Bitmain (supported by eastern PTB)
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:02:37
LN is brilliant (decentralized) as long as it is easy and cheap to use. The hurdle is cheap opt-in and opt-out if you desire to have "settled" bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-01-30 15:40:18
No, I am not.
It's just that if you take away any other player in the ecosystem Bitcoin would cease to exist immediately.
@_date: 2017-01-30 14:59:04
    Not caring = keeping status quo = resisting change (be it SegWit or Unlimited).
I think you're right about the miners significance: Here's how I view the hierarchy of the ecosystem:
    investors &gt; economic nodes* (wallet/exchanges) &gt; miners &gt; developers
(*)note, that the sheer number of nodes has no significance of its own because of Sybil-attacks.

So now we're onto defining the term "broken" in a consensus system.
Do you think there's something like a "broken" opinion. Because signalling your preferences doesn't seem to be more, than showing ones opinion publicly.
@_date: 2017-01-30 14:13:30
You actually have a point there. However people (especially miners) running a node are providing their service for the network because of egoistic motives (aka they are doing business/are in for the money). I tend to believe, that (out of self-interest) they do some due diligence before entering the game and changing some variables.
Anyways: Discussion would IMO be more friendly if the topic was: **friction good vs. bad.** instead of Core vs. Unlimited tribalism.
@_date: 2017-01-18 15:08:44
When the chart formation shows lower highs and lower lows I call this decline. Don't know how you would call it?
People ridiculed me, when I said it plateaued at 25%, now they ridicule me for pointing out that we see negative adoption (in form of a slow decline).
@_date: 2017-01-16 12:50:22
Disagreement after all is not the worst of all outcomes. And this is why I think while parts of the community failed in becoming to focused on certain authorities and ideologies, Bitcoin is just doing fine.
@_date: 2017-01-19 10:38:44
Bitcoin has the clear potential to spill-over in a big way!
@_date: 2017-01-28 07:30:47
Imo it's 50/50.
If Core delivers on the HK agreement (SegWit HF / 2MB) it'll go online with overwhelming consensus within weeks.
If not - it'll take forever.
@_date: 2017-01-20 12:11:19
you should start mining then. 
@_date: 2017-01-30 12:06:47
Let's put it in relation. We are talking about 24% of the total hashpower.
@_date: 2017-01-29 15:04:37
Yes. "I would call this a false fact" was not meant to be a direct answer to your post. I wanted to emphasize your point. :)
@_date: 2017-01-24 07:08:08
if that's the case let's go back to barter. everything else is pure slavery.
@_date: 2017-01-30 13:17:03
BU is basically the same software as Bitcoin Core.
While you can reduce/increase max. blocksize with Core when you compile your client yourself. Unlimited helps you tweak the numbers thru the nodes GUI (easier). What it does is removing friction. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 07:57:29
LOL - NO it isn't.
@_date: 2017-01-30 08:20:32
that's always true.
@_date: 2017-01-16 09:19:32
'Unproven' (thanks to some authority) people handle much more wealth than $14b.
Edit: Decentralized systems are based on self-regulation. Each and everyone decides which software to run &amp; which investment (be it coins or miners) to make. 
No authority handles Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-09 09:37:17
I love your ledger products and think they are technically the best on the market.
But I would definitely recommend you to read some books on game theory and macro economics.
If you don't understand the argument of another party you can do two things:
a) you can not look into the topic because you *think* you are right
b) you can look into the topic because you could be wrong.
Which attitude is more scientific?

"if you entered early and can not afford $20k to support the network, that made you rich,..."
@_date: 2017-08-29 07:47:47

@_date: 2017-01-29 21:59:19
no it's not. There are other crypto-currencies as well. (Decentralization can only be found in the ecosystem as a whole).

yes, but for now it is lacking.
@_date: 2017-01-30 13:52:53
You could be onto something here, that is not only true for OS projects!
How to solve the problem, that IQ is not equally spread around the population?
And how to solve the even more severe problem, that the bigger part of the population willingly puts on blinders and filters in order to not face harsh reality. Cognitive dissonance, confirmation bias, narcissm,... come to mind here.
@_date: 2017-01-09 09:56:59
Thx, for making this clear. Maybe it would help (the communication culture in here) to state, that there are different path forward. Each side has some benefits and flaws. And there will be future implications that no side will have seen in advance.
Sometimes it helps to be honest and simply state, that we [the community] don't know. This is IMO the time, when different proposals will have to be tested against each other. And that's exactly what bitcoin et al. provide. 
Bitcoin is a decision making machine. Currently deciding for status quo and against SegWit and also against BU. Maybe it's time to wait for another proposal?
Also if we could leave the SF vs. HF debate behind us - IMO there is an overwhelming majority for SegWit and bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:40:08
I would love to see SegWit activating on Litecoin. I am careful however regarding Bitcoin.

We have to be careful indeed. Is a heart surgery dangerous? Yes.

**What we should argue about is the diagnosis.** When is the right time? How do we know it's necessary to intervene? And then ask what's the right surgery method?

IMO it's better to have two visions directly competing with each other.
That's Bitcoin Core vs. Bitcoin Cash already.
@_date: 2017-08-09 13:35:47
**Solution is easy: Never settle on the block chain. Just trade IOUs.** Isn't that what Bitcoin was all about? /s
@_date: 2017-08-09 13:42:13
These issues are the reason why a big fraction of the community just forked away and another fraction of the community will fork away in Nov.
If there is no compromise I prefer Bitcoin split in 3 just to verify/falsify the underlying hypothesis.

I think you do over-estimate his influence and under-estimate your own. Unfortunately I see a pattern here. Most Bitcoiners started with a clear sense of anti-authoritarianism. Nowadays I hear a lot about Greg Maxwell and Roger Ver as if hey were some leaders of rivaling tribes. IMO they are not.
We as a community have failed. We have been falling back into an old pattern (for humankind). And it's called appeal to authority.
In Bitcoin there is no authority but you yourself as an investor (you invest time and expertise as a developer or economist, you invest money as a node owner or miner and you invest money as a holder). 
Who cares about Roger or Greg and their preferred software implementations if there is free choice to invest or divest from the project as a whole.
BTW: This is exactly opposite to what governments and states do with your money and energy/motivation.

@_date: 2017-08-03 09:42:38
Good points. However we're not there yet.
Currently Bitcoin Core is applying for infrastructure status (read adoption). So is Ethereum, Monero and now Bitcoin Cash. Who will win the contract with humanity is speculation for now. Sorry to burst your bubble, that nothing will ever dethrone Bitcoin Core because it already is infrastructure.
I would argue all day long, that Bitcoin is not there, yet. Give it a few more years and we talk. Until then I'll take the "have a seat on all major crypto rocket ships" approach.

If they fight they want you to think you succeeded. People in general and Bitcoiners as a sub group are to naive for the real power play in the world.
Relevant quote from Malcom X here:
"The press is so powerful in its image-making role, it can make the criminal look like he's a the victim and make the victim look like he's the criminal. This is the press, an irresponsible press. It will make the criminal look like he's the victim and make the victim look like he's the criminal. If you aren't careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.
If you aren't careful, because I've seen some of you caught in that bag, you run away hating yourself and loving the man — while you're catching hell from the man. You let the man maneuver you into thinking that it's wrong to fight him when he's fighting you. He's fighting you in the morning, fighting you in the noon, fighting you at night and fighting you all in between, and you still think it's wrong to fight him back. Why? The press. The newspapers make you look wrong. "

You'll figure it out on your own if you are curious and intersted in economics, I guess. We just have to wait for the market to be created and you'll see that there are two prices for LN Bitcoin and on-chain Bitcoin.

if you don't close the channel to save on fees you just have replicated the current fiat system. trading ious. a settlement system without settlement. what a brilliant idea. sounds as stupid as creating money out of thin air aka bank credit.
LN is indeed a very good invention for very small transactions &lt;$10 as long as settlement is allowed to occur due to acceptbale fees. once a channel costs $1000 to open and $1000 to close how decentralized will that be!?

A HF is not a problem if you have overwhelming consensus.
This is why humankind learned to compromise in order overcome stagnation (when beneficial).
A stagnant Bitcoin however can very well work independently from any decision in the near future. Only remaining question is if market cap spills over into other coins with dynamic block size adjustment!?
@_date: 2017-01-30 13:59:54
A growing number of all miners (currently 77%) resist a SegWit SF.
IMO resistance against SegWit HF &lt; 77%.
@_date: 2016-11-27 17:40:18
There are also people, who think Bitcoin should be a settlement layer, but to work properly even as such it needs much bigger blocks.
Most people regardless of BC or BU, see huge benefits in second layer tech.
@_date: 2016-11-28 17:09:04
IMO people on both sides of the debate have their blind spots. Instead of fighting each other, let's be precise and talk about centralization risks instead of name calling. On both sides we have very intelligent men and women, who deserve better.
Blind spot of group one: Bitcoin can be a payment network for everyday transactions. They miss the fact, that the machine payable web will heavily increase the number of transactions compared to today! Demand is infinite.
Centralization risk: Only very few high tech customers can afford to run a node and audit transactions.
Blind spot of group two: Bitcoin can be a settlement layer only. They miss the fact, that a settlement will not occur if fees are too high in comparison to the settlement value. Centralization risk: Only very few high value customers will be able to use the blockchain directly and as a store of value.
**So the meta-question everybody is talking about: 2nd layer tech before blocksize increase or blocksize increase before 2nd layer tech.** Why not code both solutions and let the network decide?
@_date: 2016-12-02 06:55:48
Actually we have seen heavy tx use before, when price goes up fast!. Maybe we should recommend people to buy bitcoin and keep it on the exchanges, because otherwise the tx to their own wallets maybe stuck for a very long time.

Bitcoin (price) as a superior settlement layer shouldn't be affected in anyway.
@_date: 2016-11-28 17:11:20
...or spill over into other crypto-coins. As settlement on an actual (however less secure) blockchain could be valued higher, than having funds stuck in 2nd layer tech. I guess we'll find out one way or another.
@_date: 2017-01-30 15:19:26
IMO, it doesn't make any difference from network perspective. At one time the dead miner will run out of money/energy and it will stop his network resistance.
If you are a miner and haven't heared of SegWit or BU, you probably are part of a special resistance team buried under 10 feet of snow and without coonection to civilization. I think not more than 2% fall under that category.
 - are you referring to the hierarchy?
Each and every player has a special role in the ecosystem. It's just that the network could and would run without the devs today. It wouldn't be improved but it still would run. This is the only reason why the hierarchy looks the way it does. Is this saddening? Maybe. Sometimes it can be enlightening to know your right place in life. Don't you agree?
On the other hand the special role of the investor is, that it includes (money, time, energy and knowledge). This is why every actor of the Bitcoin network is also an investor (hence the importance of the role).

Bitcoin is losing momentum for 10 months. This is why "big" blockers wanted to up the blocksize to 2M. In order to win at least some time, without sacrificing market shares too much.
Now it's more urgent to provide solutions in time. Back to development and less propaganda wars I guess. That'a actually a net positive for the crypto community. Devs have to actually deliver now. That's great!

ever heared of block rewards? currently 12.5 btc are mined every 10 minutes. at current prices we need $100k every 10 minutes to keep prices stable. at 30k we would need $400k every 10 minutes or $60m every day to just keep prices stable!

@_date: 2015-07-16 11:13:44
It will help develop healthy competition between other alts and bitcoin. So no. (Be aware: I am also a radical supporter for lifting the blocksize at all). Because I think markets will figure out how to work the best and know their natural/technical limits.
If chinese miners don't have enough bandwidth. Well that is good for Europe and the U.S. and will help decentralization of mining.-&gt;
When Chinese miners only mine empty blocks (because of the disadvantage through lower bandwidth) -&gt; Price will decline heavily, as the network becomes basically useless. -&gt; The miner will become unprofitable and stop it. -&gt;They will invest in better bandwidth.
The blocksize was introduced to fight spam. Besides the big block attack I can not see, why the problems can not be solved economically. 
**Besides my reservations, I still think it is better to focus on the bigger goal, that unites the whole community!**

Intrinsic value of the network.
**Edit:** *Explanation for the downvoters.* After reaching physical limitations, ASICs will become an ubiquity. If every device is possibly able to mine bitcoin you/your device might even use it with a negative return; because using the network is of greater value for you.
**Edit2:** If there is no intrinsic value to the network. No one will use it + No one will mine (hence secure) the bitcoin blockchain.

You are right. If nature decides, that ONE system (bitcoin) is the perfect solution for the problem, there will only be ONE - until there is not. The thing is, it is free to evolve unlike the current prohibitive system.
Take into account the fee maximalists in bitcoin. They are so bound to the thinking, that there will only be ONE major currency, that they don't see that the access right to the ONE digital public ledger is the next thing people will fight for. 
Alts make it easy to get rid of bitcoin, if it works not in a democratic fashion (the build-in mechanism to balance power in the ecosystem). Like the big fiat holders will lose out in the upcoming rise of bitcoin. Mircea Popescu and the like will lose out big if they want to handle bitcoin the same way.
**Edit: The relevant fee market is the fee market across all crypto-currencies regarding security requiremnets.**

No, there won't be neccessarily centralization. This is a concept you are used to, because of the simple fact, that your lazy mind is used to it. 
Once something is freed from regulation (like government controlled monetary monocultures), nature seeks to find a new balance. The optimum will be between 1 (total concentration) and infinity (total distribution). Where the optimum(range) will settle is still to be found out.

We're not in the final phase. Re-commoditization has not started, yet. 
(De)centralization stages in Bitcoin mining:
* everyone can mine on CPU/GPU (decentralization high)
* ASICs and economies of scale (centralization high)
* commoditization of ASICs (decentralization high)
Now the problem is if we assume stage 2 will become the permanent state of the network. Because then we start fighting the symptoms that obviously come with stage 2.
In order to fight (assumed permanent) centralization the only weapon we can think of is even more centralization. And it comes in the form of client and dev team centralization and even worse opinion centralization (aka censorship). In the end centralization is ALWAYS about control and power even if the surroundings change.

Supporting 2x means supporting free choice. With Bitcoin comes sovereignty and responsibility. Some people will have to learn the hard way, that sovereignty comes with duties.
I don't understand how you came to the conclusion that we are talking about theft here?
Are you against sovereign money? Are you against free choice? I rather side with people routing for sovereignty and free choice. I am glad the system is designed in a way that you can keep your 1x coin, even if majority starts to leave you for obvious reasons.
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:33:26
With sovereign money comes responsibility. Be your own bank means you can lose big time if you make wrong business decisions.
Either party can implement replay-protection if they don't want their chains users to lose money. Only some egos will be destroyed in the process. Crypto in general will be affected in the meanwhile. 5 years down the road it won't have any major influence. Maybe Bitcoin won't be non existent by then, but the world will run on crypto money.

That's actually a good point. Still I don't agree that Bitcoin needs to have customer protection. Everybody is told to invest only what he/she is willing to lose because of good reasons. Bitcoin is still an on-going experiment. 
Self-sovereignity (be your own bank) certainly comes with rights and duties. Due diligence is one of them. I don't think we should "bail out" or protect  anyone for bad investment decisions in a highly speculative new asset class! 
Isn't that what Bitcoin is all about?

No, I don't agree with that.
Status quo has nothing to do with it. If some people are interested in the weaker chain to survive they have to implement replay-protection.
I guess we'll see a cockfight here where both parties think of them as the stronger team, that doesn't need replay-protection and can take the household name "Bitcoin" with them. Well, I say let's start the fight. I'll watch closely. And will put my money accordingly. At the moment (taking hash rates into account) I would say that it's stupid to not provide replay-protection for 1x chain, because it easily might die. But that's just my 2 cents.

Why not start a company and do exactly that? Or better start a mining pool (kind of a political party).
The economic incentive of Bitcoin miners is aligned with your interest;  if they (heavily invested miners) break this bond, they will lose money over time, as you are free to choose the alt-coin that fits best to your ideologue.
PSA: Commoditization of ASICs will make it possible for many smaller consumers to start mining again. We're not there yet, but soon enough.
BTW: I support the cause for a small limited Bitcoin blockchain since there is Bitcoin Cash to opt-out at any time if they experiment fails and vice versa. Bitcoin 1x and Bitcoin 2x are both limited block chains from my perspective. If one of these small and limited chains chain gets 10% hash rate and the other 90%, I won't call the 10% hash rate coin "Bitcoin" - for sure!

if a whole community exists because of the behaviour of Blockstream and co. you should ask if it is confirmation bias which leads you to your conclusion about one company being better than all others.

this guy gets it. Bitcoin 1x and Bitcoin 2x are both limited block chains. 1M or 2M doesn't make a real difference from a big blocker perspective. Hence why I side more on the 1x side then the 2x side. But if one of these gets 10% and the other 90% hash rate I would never call the one with 10% "Bitcoin". Security is arguable the most important feature besides network effect that distinguishes Bitcoin from other alt-coins. Why would I even think about making myself easily attackable?
No matter if 1x or 2x wins out, every other coin (be it LTC, ETH, BCH, XMR) chose to go down a different path, than Bitcoin. So undeniably there are plenty of things that differentiate Bitcoin from these.
@_date: 2017-10-28 07:24:59
the same can be said about your argument.
i like how we have two different teams (Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash) to approach the same goals.
personally i don't understand why Bitcoin (the small chain vision) is infighting over a measly 1M size increase. both 1M and 2M are perfectly viable for the "decentralized nodes" vision. imo it's more about ego and less about reasoning.
* Core could easily provide their clients with a 2M version (compromise) and eliminate most of the fork associated risks.
* Miners could still defect and reunite Bitcoin after already adding segwit (compromise).
Stubbornness for the win -NOT!

didn't you know that all alts are a scam? /s
early adopter here. invested in some major alts early because of bitcoin development crisis. still am invested in all bitcoin variants. will keep doing so.
i favour a bitcoin core variant with bigger blocks. since some guys decided that this will not be possible in the nearer future i tend to side with bigger blocks. still love to see L2 solutions. more than that i like it to see client/chain diversity and many opposing development ideas competing for the future.
as long as I don't know which will be the winner(s) to rule them all. I'll choose a wait and see approach.
siding with propaganda is for people who chose to invest in only one possible future. now they are scared, that other solutions might become more successful over time. that's nonsense as every chain needs only a few user/miner to get things going. no one will hold you back to transact with your private or your sound or your transparent or your L2/iou money.
once people realize this there is nothing to fear. isn't it beatiful, that bitcoin and co. are writing human history? no matter what conflicting parties (and mostly their egos) think that should happen.
relax and take it easy. the more you value someone elses approach to climb the same mountain, the more you learn about improving your ascent techniques.

We are talking about a completly new era in human history. You can not expact people to grasp all the things, especially when they have been socialized in the current economic system. Their thinking is already formed (often, in a (solely) profit seeking way) and not capable of all the new solutions and possibilities cryptocurrencies et al. will provide. As you are the one who anticipates (parts of the future), please be respectful to all the human fellows, that don't. In their thinking everything makes completly sense. So I would encourage you to help them see instead of bashing them for their totally legit world view.  It's a blessing for us all to share these special time and possibly write history! Try to improve your knowledge and even more important, get yourself familiar with the underlying thought of bitcoin perfectly outlined by Nick Szabo: 
We will see a revolution in employment very soon, too. Still most people talk about "reducing unenmployment" (as it's believed to be a neccessary source for in(/out)come). They (people in the current "thought" system) simply can not see the writing on the walls. It's not their failure. It's your chance to make a difference!
**tl:dr; If you are a part of a system, you are not able to objectively observe it at the same time. Swanson/Masters is talking about Bitcoin as the modern type car tire for horse-drawn carriage. (Therfore) it is not a revolutionary idea. If this is how they see Bitcoin. I think they are right!**

Good for you. They also could have valued bitcoin on their fair market value, which was around $600 to 700 at that time. Because the low price of bitcoin already was an estimation of what one will get back of the defunct exchange. So i guess $483 is a arbitrary compromise. It's just favourable to get bitcoin back because price went down so far. If price rises to $1000+ it actually would have been better to keep fiat in Mt. Gox. We don't know the price at the pay-out day. Therfore we don't know in whos favour the decision to fix the price at $483 was.

Bitcoin development is not black and white. Both sides have vested interests. You've to know them all before taking a side. And maybe it's even better to invest in both sides. At least that's what TPTB did for centuries. Now Bitcoin and crypto levelled the playing field. Think about it!

imo thinking in categories of right or wrong doesn't help us out of this situation. there are certain interests which are neither right nor wrong. they are interests. as such we fight for them.
history shows us, that things with good intentions can turn to hell. and worst circumstances as a result of external influence (misfortune) and bad decisions can be fertile sole for many social and technological discoveries.

**How big exactly is the gold market compared to the currency market?**
Well. I couldn't care less. If all the people believing that bitcoin will work in its current state forever- it will be their epiphany, when they realize that wealth is just a measurement for trust. And trust is built-upon many things. Ethereum for example is trusted by big companies already, despite similar things could be achieved by bitcoin. The term "on the blockchain" is already used to describe functionality on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Open your eyes!
    * Trust in others (!!!)
    * Trust in functionality
    * Trust in useability
    * Trust in usefullness
**Bitcoin is a trust function.**
If you think bitcoin is a one-way street because of network effetcs, yo are damn wrong! Bitcoiners like FIATers will be responsible for their own downfall. To us Bitcoiners it is clear, that fiat currencies already have seen their best times. Many people are doubting the system, some are neutral, almost nobody is defending it. Confidence takes time to collapse but it is happening. You probably know, in which state fiat currencies are in their life cycle. But do you/can you also know, at which state bitcoin is in its life cycle?
**Remember: It's never inflation. It's always loss of confidence.**

@_date: 2017-05-17 11:56:23
it's highly relevant in terms of decentralization.
Assuming a user wants to make transactions instead of altruistically running a node to support a system that he doesn't use. There's a trade-off somewhere between these costs. At some point either node operating costs or transaction fees get to high to be long term sustainable for network health (read decentralization).
In other words if you go for one extreme (limit blocks to 1M) you lose out on both users and nodes. That is what market share tells us.
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:43:45

Current solution could freeze any on-chain scaling activities for a long time if not forever, which means an economic altering of the Bitcoin incentive structure. IMO we haven't evaluated which step is more dangerous to Bitcoin, a HF with the possibility of two or several minority chains (if they not die) or a fundamental change in how Bitcoin economically operates. HF more than SF are an election on a certain proposed solution. If such a proposal fails, it fails. If it succeeds it succeeds.

who is they...?
I am an advocate for reasonable bigger blocks and 2nd layer tech. I call XT, Classic and BU the way forward because of Core's stalemate.
I am very suspicious of Blockstream, Bitmain, Bitfury and DCG, which are all big players, playing their own (not the users) game. All of them take their power either from centralization (knowledge, money, resources) or appeal to authority.

Why not SegWit as a HF including 2M. Who do you think will resist? Have you even asked the other side?
@_date: 2017-07-04 06:29:38
those coins however are derivatives of BTC and will have a different price.
Price could be more or could be less. Dependent on market perception.
@_date: 2015-03-30 08:17:38

Great to see more and more diversification!
@_date: 2017-07-27 09:59:54
US elites want to keep their position of power after the presumed dollar collapse. This is the main reason they push for Segbitcoin and L2 via some useful cypherpunk idiots.

Has anybody thought about this? What if these hackers try to exchange their stolen fiat money for real money. Cause why the hell would they want to keep their new won riches in a doomed government controlled currency?
Could this be the start of the next rallye?

Here's the link to the article. It is paywalled. Hope it works though! 
@_date: 2017-05-18 08:09:50
Both, a SF and a HF have trade offs.
If you can not see this, you won't understand the other side.
@_date: 2015-02-18 16:40:04
What is up with you guys? Can't you connect the dots? This is totally Bitcoin related - even if the word BITCOIN is NOT mentionend in the text!
@_date: 2017-07-29 04:25:32
**so much for a "decentralized" exchange.**
@_date: 2015-02-28 22:12:41
Sentiment is/was still bearish (after 14 month downtrend) and doesn't change in the blink of an eye.
@_date: 2017-05-18 08:14:27
And that my friend is exactly the problem. You do not know where the LN will lead us. And if you say so you are a lier. The other side tries to be conservative about altering the economic incentive structure of Bitcoin. That is why they don't rush for SegWit/LN, when there is no guarantee, that Bitcoin can also grow as it is. Its a safety measure just as you describe a SF as a more secure solution over a HF.

it will take alot of "time" to understand, what bitcoin really is.
**if you see bitcoin as money, you look at it from the past.**
@_date: 2015-02-20 14:23:29
Bitcoin is like cash. If you don't trust him don't give him your money or use an escrow service.
@_date: 2015-03-02 16:23:16
Exactly this. Not at all are you saving/"earning" a single penny by using a credit card.
@_date: 2016-07-28 19:04:49
it only works, when the economy runs well. this is why they desperately try to keep the machine running. when the economy turns down for longer time frames it's basically a house of cards.
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:48:04
over which time period? markets are more about timing than price.

Volatility is not a problem at all. Not for now, while things are still price tagged in $ and not later, when bitcoin will have become more stable due to broader acceptance. Also have a nice read:

@_date: 2015-02-28 21:57:09
It won't be changed in bitcoin. Many have written about the why. Bitcoin is open source. Everybody is free to bring up a coin with another economic model. Look at altcoins for instance.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:45:20
Here you go. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 13:23:34
according to Adam it'll be 9-12 month in 2018, in 2019, in 2020 until at least 2140.
There's never a right time for a HF. Next best time is now (+some time to coordinate).
@_date: 2015-02-26 18:57:04
True. This is one possible outcome. Bitcoins can be seen as a "right" to write something in the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-02-28 08:08:47
This is a great usecase! Bitcoin in it's adulthood will be quite stable with deflationary tendencies.
To counter these tendecies local currencies that have in-built demurrage for hoarding could be a powerful solution. In your concept this could be a constant source of money (most people are willing to spend) because they can see where the money goes to (e.g. local institutions, associations, community,...).
While paper backed local currency seems to be necessary at the moment. Ten years from now, it will not be as important as it is today. Don't forget about the additional costs. Other community (currency) projects showed, that where electronic payment was enabled, paper transactions declined.
I would like to encourage you to become a pioneer in this field. This might be the way, local communities will finance themselves in the future!

who do you think puts the government in place? the voters? no. the voters get only the choice to vote between two pre-selected names they approved. media comes to assistance to frame the feeling of democratic choice. sorry to burst your bubble.

Bull shit. Bitcoin was at $3B when the debate heated up. Monero has a market cap of almost $1B.

None. Nobel prize is a boring centralized thingy. We as a community are aiming for decentralization. So if at all, decentralize the prize!

There is a high probability, mining will cost you lots of money and bring you nothing in return. If you consider mining at a net loss and as a hobby project to learn more about the technology I won't stop you. Just be sure you do your due dilligance.
Be sure to learn more about mining, before investing. You can find out more in depth here: 
These are the guys mining bitcoin these days:
If you are interested in acquiring a bunch of bitcoins, just buy them.
Edit: Also consider running a fullnode. By doing so you help the network and learn how the bitcoin system operates.
@_date: 2015-02-18 16:13:02
Actually, I am more interested in getting bits, than gems.
If I want to introduce my friends to an unknown message app and an unnkown cryptocurrency chances are almost zero, they will appreciate it. But: They know telegram and they know bitcoin!
BTW: Just received 0.02 bitcoin by inviting 20 of my friends to telebit.

the concepts of basic income are almost all flawed. in it's essence it is a form of insurance. like democracy it will work best in smaller communities. governments are bankrupt anyways. so the money will not come from them. however helicopter money masked as basic income will be their last straw to stay in power.
Besides that: coming AI revolution will make rent from machines or open access to the means of production a necessity - if you don't want the majority to starve.

God help anyone who takes propaganda seriously. Applies to r/bitcoin and r/btc as well by the way.

Basically agree on what you said/added.

adoption first means decentralization through wide spread usage. so i think flags don't help here. i'm actually supporting both. i'd like to find a balanced middle ground.

You seem to be new to Bitcoin. Are you sure you want to start mining?
@_date: 2015-02-28 08:13:46
@_date: 2016-07-28 19:10:58
I came to the same conclusion. Your worldview is heavily dependent on one question.
**Was the government story of 19 conspirators true? Yes or No.**
Everybody I know, who researched this topic for more than 5 hours and beyond articles from corporate media came to the same conclusion.
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:02:03
so why is a second layer even needed, if these kind of things don't make Bitcoin special?
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:27:13
who are the competitors of gold? and who are the competitors of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:30:40
to become digital gold it is enough to keep it in centralized vaults aka exchanges. no more scaling needed. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:23:16
no one to blame besides yourself. 
luckily people made a lot of money and gained power, diversifying when they realized the toxicity of people like you.

@_date: 2017-06-08 10:09:35
This. If just both sides of the debate could come to the conclusion that we have to find the equilibrium and not fall for the noisy extremist positions. 
**Node count/cost on one side and transaction count/cost on the other.**
@_date: 2017-06-23 21:10:27
absolutely. dito.

i agree. It better to have strong Bitcoin, strong Ethereum and strong Bitcoin with unique value propositions.

**Don't worry guys. Surely everybody is willing to open a LN channel for $100+ to "store" his 43$ of coffee money.**
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:19:09
how can "they" do this, if i use monero and pay like $0.50 in comparison?
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:18:03
because that many potential users transact &gt;$500k on a regular basis. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 11:39:41
we have a problem houston. you can not spend such small amounts. because FEES.
edit: funny thing: the last time this debate came up, bitcoin hit new heights and was about to go down for 2 years in the aftermath.
@_date: 2016-07-21 16:42:52
you obviously do not understand the concept of resilience. other blockchains will function as a possible backup. it's never a good thing to put all eggs in one basket. markets know that. in other words.
