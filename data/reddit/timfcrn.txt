Good question.
Governments and media use "hoarding" as a way to demonize savers and justify higher inflation levels, negative interest rates, etc.  They also did this a while back when savings' accounts paid interest by implying that savers were sitting around earning interest, when almost all savers had worked hard for their money and were earning a return from a lot of work.
I agree with you that it's not hoarding; but how can a government pass on negative rates if everyone likes savers?  They can't.  So they first have to demonize savers, then pass negative rates.  As for your second part of the question, yes, that's the way the banking system works, but banks haven't passed off as much money as before.  Still, they don't want to demonize banks - those fund their campaigns.  They want to demonize savers; they're an easy target, especially with few people even having a savings anymore.

[As I wrote about this, I think these are just rumors](  Given the demand for ETC and the trading in both bitcoin, ether and Ethereum Classic, it *really* appears that someone is buying Ethereum Classic with the other two.  This trend is part of the cause for speculation that Coinbase or another exchange is doing this because they're going to have to offer their customers ETC.  For instance, if GDAX doesn't have *any ETC*, they will have to buy it on the open market - and with what?  They're looking at selling Dollars, Bitcoins and Ether to do so.  **This is the basis for the rumor** and people are looking at the volume and assuming that's what is happening.
This whole hard fork mess in Ethereum has now bled over to Bitcoin.  Even if the rumors are untrue, it's another example of why the arrogance of the Ethereum community has affected people outside their community.

For day-to-day banking, it's great if a person lives in an area where he can use bitcoin for everything.  This is not a reality for many people.  Still, I am seeing more people use bitcoin for day-to-day stuff, thanks to the bitpay card.
On the other hand, I have no interest in closing my bank accounts that are for investing/retirement.  [Bitcoin is a great investment, and so are many other things]( YTD there have already been investments that have blown past bitcoin, so for the types who hold only, it makes sense to close all your bank accounts and just use bitcoin.  For investors and traders, this is foolish because bitcoin already gave us plenty of short/swap opportunities that allowed us to short, profit, sell, come back to bitcoin and have more bitcoins.  In addition, there will be some great opportunities in mainstream markets this year.
The angle of investing in companies with bitcoin is still a major gap in bitcoin use.  Sure, we can use WhaleClub and stuff, but options there are very, very limited and they're limited to hyped companies.  Bitcoin has a long way to go in the investing-in-companies world.

Even if bitcoin goes 10 multiples in 5 years, traders can still do higher than that by swapping in and out of trades.  So, let's review:
1.  Holders should hold because they're not traders and are satisfied with the results of just holding.
2.  Traders should trade because they're traders and aren't satisfied with the holding results only.
It's almost as if different strategies work for different people!

[Good question and here's your answer - using bitcoin as the example](


If Bob creates a cure for cancer and only accepts bitcoin, people will spend their bitcoin.  Someone *not spending* is telling entrepreneurs, "Your products suck."

1.  China has the most miners of any country.
2.  Chinese citizens own a lot of bitcoins; if bitcoin succeeds, China is rich.
3.  The government doesn't directly benefit from banning bitcoin.
Keep in mind that China restricted leverage, it did not ban bitcoin.  [As I wrote last year](


[In 2015]( China limited trading leverage in stocks because speculators drove up the price of stocks.  Get-rich-quick traders love leverage, but there's a ton of evidence that it's bad for the average investor.  My Chinese stocks then soared, even though there was no reason at all.  Sure enough, it was excessive leverage.  The Chinese government cracked down on it and the stocks corrected (yay! they were cheap again) and they've continued to do well.
Anyone who's invested in China in the past knew this was coming with bitcoin; the government in China does not like or approve of massive leverage like we saw.

If you oppose taxes, get involved in the system and stop them.  Not paying your taxes is illegal and you will get in trouble.  If you do oppose taxes, though, you can run for office and change the tax laws - that is the legal route and if you can get enough people to agree, it should be very possible.
As a note, I do think we should all be involved in the system in general; for instance, I'm trying to get Texas to use bitcoin as one of the underlying currencies for their coming gold depository (Giovanni is a big bitcoin user).  We can actively participate in our government to reform it instead of always running from it.  Face problems and win; run from problems and watch them catch up with you and pummel you.

This is sad news, but like with BTCJam, I feel that this is *people getting what they deserve*.  These sites were the easiest way to obtain bitcoins through bitcoin growth; some users had figured out techniques to generating 10-15% easily.  But many Millenials in the United States and Europe who favored big government and big regulations are seeing the effect.  I suspect for BitLendingClub a lot of this is due to the USA, though I'm hearing Europe is also getting worse for businesses.  I wouldn't dream of starting a business in either country and I'd keep my bitcoin startups out of both.
You want to vote for big government?  Prepare for a world where you lose a lot of opportunity.  Actions have consequences; enjoy them!
(Also, this is bearish for bitcoin too.  With fewer ways to grow bitcoins, there's less reason to own them.  I'm going to have to start digging into other POS cryptos.)

You are exactly the problem with the bitcoin community and I'm glad you posted that.
Bitcoinaires need to stop running from mainstream problems and start fighting by being a part of government.  The government is supposed to be *of the people*.  If you use bitcoin as an escape, I promise you that you will lose.  A better idea is get involved, like participating in local governments and helping them pass laws that encourage innovation in this space.
Also, getting involved in government to stop war and stop spending is just as important.  If you want lower taxes, get involved.  This is reality and bitcoin won't save you in the long run if you think it's a good "escape" - there is no escape and there never will be.
Running from problems don't make them go away; facing them and fighting them will.

-  ZH never presented evidence outside of a very vague BB terminal post and from what I read in Chinese new, none of that was new.  ZH and BB presented this as new.
-  If you're in bitcoin and you're scared about governments against it, you should get out.  This won't ever stop.
-  The price definitely fell following the ZH article.  Take what you want from that.
-  I don't think China is in trouble at all.  A country with so many problems is hoarding oil and buying Russian bonds?  Huh?  That makes no sense.
-  Bitcoin's market cap is $12 billion on a good day.  A multi-trillion dollar economy like China is threated by $12 billion?  LMAO - wow!

Nope.  I believe in supporting the bitcoin community.
The way that I will give every bitcoinaire free value when I die is by allowing my bitcoins to cease being used, which means that everyone's bitcoins will have higher value since the ones I own will be out of the available supply.  In my mind, the best way to give to everyone equally is to "burn" the existing funds.  This way everyone who owns bitcoins now owns more of a percent of the *available* supply.

Never underestimate the power of greed; a cash ban is the start of financial tyranny and in the long run, bitcoin will be destroyed too.  However, first you divide (using greed), then you conquer.
