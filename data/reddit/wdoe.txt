Inflation is almost always an effect of growth of a money supply. (Eg: More money being minted).
I'm not talking about growth of demand, growth of uses, or growth of value.

@_date: 2013-04-23 19:24:41
You *do* realize that an inflation graph plots a percentage change each year, right? Have you taken much calculus?
For example, start with $100, increase 5% per year.
y00: 100.00
y01: 105.00
y02: 110.25
y03: 115.76
y04: 121.55
y05: 127.63
y06: 134.01
y07: 140.71
y08: 147.75
y09: 155.13
y10: 162.89
Clearly that is exponential growth of the market cap. It can be modeled by an exponential equation. Now, if we look at SGD, we see that it inflates by some positive percent nearly every year. No, it doesn't perfectly fit an exponential line because the percent fluctuates, but you can get pretty damn close if you plot it out. Sure, there is some variance, but it is definitely not linear.
Now, stability has to do with fluctuations in *value*, and SGD is damn strong.

I'm here to discuss, not teach. If you don't know the difference between value and price, you have no business in a discussion about value.
The price will ALWAYS fluctuate wildly, regardless of the currency. It is relative to some other currency, and is changed by two sets of fluctuations due to countless externalities, as well as market speculation in both currencies.

Do you see the word value in there anywhere? Did you completely ignore everything I've said?
Clearly if I'm talking about INFLATION, then I am not talking about the value of currency INCREASING. It isn't hard.
@_date: 2013-04-29 03:32:56
No, we cannot say with any certainty that it would be stable on a large scale either. The odds are [probably] higher, yes - Each "player" has less influence on the price, but not so much the value. We have absolutely no idea what might cause huge fluctuations in VALUE (not price) at a macro scale.
Look, here is the really simple version: If you try to predict market trends given little information, you are probably going to be wrong.
Why can't you see the fallacy in using one single factor as the total indicator for stability? Do you not understand how many other factors come into play?
@_date: 2013-04-20 20:14:52
You started with:


And now you're arguing:


These are two entirely different things. Since you obviously can't distinguish between them, I'm done talking to you. It is obvious that a company would choose more money and a free market given a bad situation already exists. They would not create a bad situation just to do so, it just ends up costing them.
@_date: 2013-04-24 22:35:15
It is not possible for the value of Bitcoin to **remain constant** but it is possible to **remain stable**. It will not deviate much from how it is expected to.
Even though most fiat currencies devalue over time, they are still stable in the sense that they don't experience large, unexpected fluctuations.
So, clearly you don't understand what value stability is, and I'm done talking to you. I'm not here to teach economics.
@_date: 2013-04-20 20:31:03


No shit. And you started by insinuating that MtGox might be behind it. The DDoS doesn't CAUSE them to make money. It causes them to LOSE money. The increased trades are entirely temporary.
Can you please just answer me this simple question, preferably with a yes or no.
Are you dumb enough to think that an unstable service will be more successful than a stable one?
Just a simple yes or no, and I'll be done.

@_date: 2013-04-23 09:23:00
Oh my god, it's like talking to a wall.
Are you claiming that there is no currency that has satisfied both of these conditions for some period of time?
1. Can be modeled by an exponential function for that period. (Eg: Upward at an increasing rate).
2. Has not widely deviated from that model for that period.
For fuck's sake, I'll just go find an example. I can't believe anyone is stupid enough to think stability and increasing growth are mutually exclusive, let alone try to argue it for this long.
@_date: 2013-04-23 08:59:41
Who said anything about indefinitely? No shit that is ludicrous, but it is a moot point.
Have there been any currencies that have had a general upward, nonlinear trend for a decent amount of time? Yes, plenty.
You can argue against shit I've never said all day, but it doesn't change anything.
Yes, bitcoin will experience inflation at some point, as does any currency that can be minted. Don't be delusional.
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:47:24
Define **growing**.
That is your issue. You have a preconceived notion of growth that you've assumed I'm talking about. Growth can mean multiple things, which is why I've clearly stated I'm talking about growth of the market cap.

Most currencies that experience inflation can be closely modeled by an exponential function. Are you claiming that there has never been a somewhat stable currency?
I think you're blowing what I said out of proportion. If you take it entirely literally, there is no fallacy.

SGD. Inflation nearly every year, still the second most stable currency.
@_date: 2013-04-23 03:52:01
You really can't make the assumption that the supply will remain stable, or that the number of users will grow faster than the market cap of BTC. Adoption could just as easily go down (we could be in a fad bubble), or stagnate (we reach full techie adoption, but no one else wants to touch it), or explode. The mining rates can also change, but we know it has a generally curved trend over time, making one or more peaks, but ultimately converging at zero. We can't really know if they will go up or down right now.
We can make an educated guess and say that adoption will outpace mining in the long run (it very likely will if BTC survives), and that will be a force driving demand upward. But to say that means that BTC will only go up means you must ignore all other forces. In my opinion, there are much, much stronger forces than the adoption rate, and I have no idea if the price will rise.
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:35:35
Another gold junkie bashing BTC because it isn't gold...
BTC is not chaotic because of its inability to be regulated by a central authority on a daily basis. It is chaotic because it has low adoption right now. Every person who trades has a huge influence on the perceived value. Yes, he is spot on about demand changing rapidly, but that is an issue that will solve itself when the market opens up to BTC. Right now its value is completely speculative, and extremely susceptible to to walling, pump and dumps, etc.
BTC will gain stability with adoption and as more uses open up. The inability to be printed on demand by a central authority has little to do with it.

@_date: 2013-04-25 03:06:36
I think not.
If you think value stability means one constant value, then literally no currency has ever, or will ever be stable. (Even precious metals). End of discussion.

@_date: 2013-04-28 19:50:46
k lol


I don't see very many ways that could be interpreted. It is painfully obvious that you don't know the difference between price and value, and even more obvious that you think value growth, decline, and stability are mutually exclusive. If you think that value must not change to be stable, I can deduce that you think it must remain constant.
Feel free to correct me, but it seems pretty damn obvious from that post.
@_date: 2013-04-23 10:30:41
Nearly every fiat currency undergoes inflation (**growth** of money **supply**), and plenty of them have periods of stability.
Lets look at the Singapore dollar!
Look back as far as the history goes! It has undergone inflation nearly every year. You know what that means right? Well, given it is a fiat currency, that's likely due to the money supply increasing every year. Durp, right?
Here's a funny thing about SGD: It is regarded by the EWI to be one of the four most stable currencies in the world.
Sure, it can't keep it up forever, but it has for quite a damn long time.
Now, will you please eat your words?
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:16:31
Merchant adoption increases the demand, but not necessarily the number of BTC holders. Like I said, as the number of BTC holders rises, each holder has a lesser market share, and a lesser influence.
If merchants get in on it, the demand will go up, and the price will go up. This may lead to a higher adoption rate, but maybe not.
*Edit: I am making the assumption that merchant adoption doesn't actually increase the number of holders (right now), most merchants that accept BTC already had wallets.*
*Edit2: I am claiming this is right:*


*But this is wrong:*

Exponential functions are not always explosive depending on coefficients. Pretty much any inflationary currency can be modeled by an exponential function. (The currency supply, not the value obv).
Look up the SGD: Yearly inflation, but still one of the most stable (value doesnt deviate heavily).
@_date: 2013-04-28 21:37:12
Like I have been saying from the start, there are too many factors involved for growth to be a reliable predictor of stability. Sure, we can say that it is very likely a positive correlation, but we have no idea how large of a factor it is, and it DEFINITELY isn't the only factor.
It is extremely naive to predict market trends based off limited factors, which is one reason that economic study in general is heavily scrutinized. There are so many factors that the output looks entirely random until you reach insanely large scales. (This is why you can effectively predict national GDP trends, but no one can predict individual stock values). 
It all really comes down to simple statistics.
@_date: 2013-04-28 17:32:21
There is no currency in existince with the property of a constant value. Even gold wildly fluctuates in both price and value. Why would you assume I am talking about something that doesnt exist?
It is not my fault that YOU cant understand simple economics. And it is not MY job to teach you. You are delusional if you think otherwise.
@_date: 2013-04-23 03:34:03
This is hilariously wrong.
To increase the stability, you increase the number of adopters. The more adopters, the less market share each has, the less influence each person has on the price. It is basically statistics 101.
Growth and stability have very little to do with eachother. You can have exponential growth and near constant stability, or no growth and huge elasticity.
@_date: 2013-04-20 18:54:15

@_date: 2013-04-27 20:03:01
My unpopular opinion: You shouldn't.
Don't put anything in BTC you can't afford to lose right now.
I don't know much about Japanese investing, but you should create a proper asset allocation that will carry you through good times **and** bad times. This generally means bonds, domestic high/mid/low cap stocks, foreign high/mid/low cap stocks. Diversification is key. Low cost index funds are great for this, they seek to match the entire market. Your bond allocation share will be higher if your risk tolerance is lower. If your currency is volatile, consider more foreign assets than domestic.
Don't try to time the market either - It can easily lead to panic buying/selling (panicking and selling underperforming assets, bandwagoning and buying overperforming assets). For example: Even if you are 100% sure this dramatic inflation is going to happen, there are thousands of people that are going to know too, and use the same shelters, creating a bubble. You are remarkably average, and have about a 50% chance of getting in too late.

Are you saying that SGD has no inflation?
SGD clearly has had inflation nearly every year. The market cap (what I'm talking about when I say GROWTH) has been increasing at an increasing rate over time, which can be modeled by an exponential function.
You should read graphs carefully. If you plot a percent delta each year, that is **definitely** not the same as plotting the aggregate value.
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:53:33


I am saying there is little correlation between market cap growth (I hope you know what that is, or I might as well not even reply) and value stability.
If you think there is a correlation (positive or negative) in BTC, due to its fairly predictable market cap function, the stability should either be strictly increasing or decreasing for the rest of time. I just don't believe that. I think the value stability has too many externalities to even consider market cap growth as any sort of indicator for stability.
Like I said: Market cap and value stability have little to do with eachother.
