I'd love a study personally.  But even a study would be inaccurate.

Oh.  So why don't we decrease the block size since increasing it doesn't help the problem?
@_date: 2016-01-05 20:08:44


Um.... how do you figure?
@_date: 2016-01-12 13:04:43
Or you buy more in the stock market since it is low.  Hence the odd statement of "buy low, sell high"

Lol I hope you are kidding.  The US economy is far from a free system.  There are so many incentives, tariffs, and specifically stated laws that help some and hurt others economically that have no rhyme or reason.

Lol.  I hope you are kidding.  Do you know why oil prices are down?  Its not because demand isn't high on oil prices.  Oil prices will go up again later this year.  I can guarantee you that.  Its not that profitable now but it will continue to be profitable.  
Everything you do has oil involved in some way.  Just because the market is very slowly creeping to renewables, doesn't mean oil is not profitable by any means.

I can believe that.  Another poster above stated that people wanting bitcoins main motivation isn't for illegal things.  But as a bitcoin user, I really see no other reason to own it as a currency.

Oil is not cheap because demand is down.  Oil is cheap because Saudi Arabia and OPEC have driven it down to economically hurt Iran.  
Are you not paying attention to world events at all?  Or do you just hear about something and make your own justification for it?
@_date: 2016-01-13 20:46:08
lol i hope you are kidding at this point.  I may have not been 100% correct but my point still stood. OPEC can do something about oil prices.  They can stop producing so much which would increase the price of it.  They are intentionally keeping it low.  
So how about the green technology you said?  oh wait... what were you right about or saying again?

I was happy to hear this as I bought some S&amp;P500 index funds at the end of the day.  Wooo hooo!  Its on sale!

Shhh.. strange internet forums is where I lurk and spread my answers.
@_date: 2016-01-13 18:52:10
Oh yea.  Oops.  Its because the US and other countries have started producing a lot more oil than there is demand.  In otherwords, production has increased while demand has stayed steady.
So actually it has nothing to do with people turning to green energy.  In fact, when oil prices are low, it hurts green technologies since green technologies are so expensive compared to oil.

Lol if my coins went to 1 million I'd sell.  Ain't no body using something so lucrative to get into at that point for currency.

You should really read about Black Swans.  That kind of thought and argument is partially why the financial crisis happened in the first place.  
@_date: 2016-02-05 13:01:32
Cool.  Good job you.  Not may other people are following your lead.

With all the warnings in airports, I doubt anyone would actually take one.

I thought apple already helped the FBI in phones in the past?  Also, is McAfee serious?  Isn't that the same guy that had his two female friends mysteriously die and then he made a break for the USA before he could get caught?  Id love to see his company hack an iphone

Yes but most people pay the electricity in $.  Most people compare the value of bitcoin to the USD.  Face it.  Bitcoin is not bigger than the USD, nor more important currently.  The way it was specified makes way more sense than using Satoshi currently.
