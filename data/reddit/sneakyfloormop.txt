BTC weren't as valuable 2 years ago as they are today. I mean don't get me wrong, it's not smart. But thats the fact of the matter.

I saw that you have given out all of the BTC but that's ok, I just wanted to post my story. Today was my first forray into BTC, after repeatedly waiting and waiting and finding excuses (well not having money is sort of an excuse haha) I finally rustled up 34$ to buy 0.03 btc. I then set out to spend said BTC and was able to buy a coffee, a shirt AND a small little gift for my SO for xmas. Now that my wallet is looking a little low I cannot wait until MTGox approves me so I can buy a little more and carry around the wallet on my phone. 
Not that exciting of the story but I sure had a blast with it and I look forward to becoming more involved in the community in the future. Good on you for doing this and getting more people interested. Also, you are an excellent artist. Thanks for reading if you did and have a good one!

could you expand on this a bit further? As an IT guy, when you discuss protocol I assume you are mentioning a delivery method. If this is the case, could you enlighten me as to some speculation of other "apps" that would be delivered? Sorry if I sound snarky, not trying to, just trying to grasp the entirety of what you are saying.

If you have the means to obtain the matching keys which the NSA does (can demand from vendor) I don't see how that is broken. They don't need to go into detail but for the post to have merit they should be talking about which ones were broken so people can adjust their security accordingly.

Is it safe to keep our bitcoins in a Multibit wallet with a long pass phrase? I just got into Bitcoins (been meaning to for years now but never really had disposable) finally put together a bit of extra cash and bought 34$ worth (0.033) while not alot of money, is it safe to keep the BTC here or should I think of another way?
Thanks!
