If miners roll back then all transactions after that point (many hours) would become unconfirmed, right? If so that would be terrible for confidence in confirmed Bitcoin transactions if I understand correctly.

Thank you for the response. Can you also explain how your exchange rate is calculated? It's just as important as the fees.

LibertyX will probably give you more bitcoin for your money after all rates and fees are considered. It's possible to buy more than $2500/day if you are fully verified and approved for high limits.

Okay thanks for the reply. Good to know about the whitehat URL.

One thing to keep in mind is that it's only a gain if the value of your bitcoins increases between the time you buy and sell them. You don't owe capital gains tax on the *entire* value of your bitcoins every time you convert, just the profit you realized due to bitcoin price fluctuations. I believe you can also deduct any losses from your gains.

TL;DR I had a similar experience with Coin.MX that made me feel like they are unqualified to properly run a financial business.
I was anxious to make my first BTC purchase and Coinbase required me to wait for bank verification so I continued searching. I stumbled upon Coin.MX who would allow me to buy BTC immediately.
There were a few yellow flags right away:
1) Their website [at the time] displayed a Forbes logo, but if you looked closely Forbes had merely discussed Bitcoin and NOT Coin.MX. Seemed intentionally misleading.
2) They're not a business, but some sort of private club (See 
3) They were willing to accept credit cards, despite the possibility of chargebacks on irreversible BTC transactions.
4) Their BTC prices seemed unusually high (e.g. current price right now on Coin.MX is $638 vs $611 on Bitstamp).
I ultimately decided not to give them my private information since I had a gut feeling it was a bad idea. They repeatedly sent me a bunch of emails asking me to fill in my credit cards/private info so I asked to be unsubscribed from the mailing list. Instead they completely cancelled my account (
Probably for the best though.

Might get downvoted for this, but hear me out. Unless you're an expert Electrical Engineer and Computer Scientist with a lot of free time, at some level you'll always need to trust the manufacturer or another group of people.
For high-value wallets in my opinion the only 100% trustable solution is to do something so simple and obvious that there can be no doubts:
Create a private key directly from dice rolls (i.e. use the method that dicewallet uses)
1) You can be 100% certain that nobody will find a 'bug' in your RNG that reveals its output to be orders of magnitude more predictable you believed
2) You can be 100% certain that a software bug did not reduce the randomness of your dice rolls, since you can manually verify that the private key is equivalent to what you rolled
Rolling dice is a lot of work, so for practical purposes you'll likely want to generate additional private keys from the number you rolled by using a deterministic (predictable outcome) method that preserves entropy (randomness). Hierarchical deterministic wallets do this. If you're not confident in the math behind HD wallets then simply use the seed directly as your private key.
Never lose sleep over hackers/governments stealing your funds due to broken RNGs again.

Awesome app.
Does anyone know of a way to verify that the Github sources match the code in the binary (e.g. by building with XCode and comparing the signatures somehow)? If not I might look into how to do that.
EDIT: If I only cared about myself I could simply build from source. But it might be nice for non-developers to hear from a variety of sources: "We all checked that the sources match the binary. Looks good."

Personally I'd never put more than $100 on a hardware wallet.
Hardware wallets are a high-value target for supply chain attacks. Assuming your hardware wallet is not multisig, it only takes one properly executed attack to lose all of your money (e.g. the wallet purposely generates keys using a weak random number generator that is predictable by the attacker but undetectable by anyone else).

They require someone to compromise the hardware wallet manufacturer or anyone in the supply chain (or the firmware signing key), not you specifically. This is completely possible and realistic and you might not know until it was too late.

If you need Bitcoin quickly, you may want to check if there are LibertyX locations near you. LibertyX only accepts cash (not credit cards), but you would receive the coins instantly and you would not have to deal with p2p.

@_date: 2016-12-19 03:43:50
When you're using ACH or credit cards, the verification/limits process is slow presumably because the exchange is taking the risk that you chargeback or reverse the ACH. Note that reversal risk includes identity theft (i.e. the customer never intended to purchase from the exchange in the first place). In this case the exchange would be out the bitcoin with no money to show for it. It is therefore prudent for the exchange to raise limits slowly while you build trust.
An alternative would be cash-accepting services (e.g. sellers on LocalBitcoins, LibertyX) since reversals are not possible. Of course, you will probably have to sacrifice some convenience or pay additional fees compared to ACH. Note that due to US federal regulation, all legitimate businesses who sell Bitcoin directly to consumers will impose limits and verify your identity.

Beware of large fees hidden in exchange rates. As of right now, Coinme lists their bitcoin price as $8,161.97, versus [LibertyX]( at $7,542.95. That's an 8.2% markup just in the price difference.

**Make sure you use the official Google Play store** and not some 3rd-party site. Third party APK sites have a higher risk of modifying the app to steal your money.

If you're considering using a Bitcoin ATM, beware of large fees hidden in exchange rates. I've seen companies charge a hidden 8-15% fee by marking up their price above the [TradeBlock XBX]( index, and then charge an additional fee on top of that! You should also compare the prices and fees to your nearest [LibertyX]( location if there are any near you.

There's a lot of nonsense going on in the industry, so you're right to be skeptical. Many projects are hoping you don't fully understand the technology and you'll hand them some money "just in case" it takes off. Your best bet is to educate yourself so you can make an informed decision on what the potential risks and rewards are.
The original Bitcoin whitepaper is only 9 pages long, including citations and diagrams. It elegantly solves a well-defined problem in the field of Computer Science known as the Byzantine Generals Problem. It is direct, concise, and significant. This is very different from most of the other projects in this space.

Hi OP, I don't know your personal situation and all business ventures carry some amount of risk. So this is not legal or financial advice.
To run a legally compliant business, you take on potentially large costs and liabilities (Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, MSB registration, see comment written by etc.). And you need to keep your bitcoin secure so it isn't stolen. I think this business model only makes sense at a much larger scale.
In my opinion, a less risky option would be to purchase a traditional ATM and use it to sell [**both** bitcoin and traditional cash withdrawals]( That way one piece of hardware can be used for two business activities and you're getting much more value for investment.
In this model, you can still make commissions from bitcoin sales but LibertyX handles a large portion of the risk, marketing, compliance, customer service, and security -- things that do not make sense for one person to do alone.

Bitcoin companies are asking for your personal info due to federal and state laws and regulations – it's probably not something you can avoid if you want to purchase from a reputable company.

Personally I'd never put more than $100 on a hardware wallet in a single-signature setup.
Hardware  wallets are a high-value target for supply chain attacks. Assuming your hardware wallet is not multisig, it only takes one properly executed attack for everyone using that product to be vulnerable to leak their private keys.
For example: Even if you roll dice to create your seed, the wallet can be modified to use a weak random number generator that makes it trivial for the attacker to compute your private key from your \[publicly broadcasted\] transaction signature, but is undetectable by anyone else.
Of course, if you're adding a hardware wallet as an additional required signature to your existing setup, it can only help. But I don't see most people distinguishing between multisig and single-signature when they recommend a hardware wallet.
