Yeah right... I'm waiting 5 days, coming up to six for a SEPA transfer...

I tried to get my brother to buy BTC using my Coinbase referral, instead he shorted it / placed bets on the value using plus 500, a correction happened, they closed his position and he lost thousands. 
I didn't get my $10 referral which would be worth $50 by now, he lost thousands and never actually got to hold BTC.

Yes! Please get a friend to video it! You can then sell that video to news outlets and buy more BTC ;)

Don't mine Bitcoin, mine alts. Sell them to buy Bitcoin.
Go to whattomine.com &amp; put in your stats, that will tell you what to mine based upon your hardware, difficulty etc.

If I Google Bitcoin it's all 'anti-BTC' 'the bubble will/has burst, these so called experts say bitcoin is the devil etc' and all of the YouTube channels tend to be 'hey noobs, crypto is going to the moon, here's a referral, join my crew'

I've been waiting 5 days for my SEPA transaction to go through
@_date: 2019-11-04 22:44:25
At least 365 of those are me checking the price... it's become part of a morning routine
@_date: 2019-12-25 22:43:14
The remaining 1% is inaccurate TA.

I'm with you. I tend to just bite the bullet and pay the fee most of the time as the bank transfers take 2-3 days minimum, which, with my luck... The price usually goes up 5%+ during that time and I was better off paying the fee.

Dumb post. No comparison for reference, edited and doesn't make sense unless explained. A better example would be a freddo, can of coke, packet of crisps... Things people actually reguarly buy that have increased in value, not a generic price of an unnamed meal
@_date: 2019-01-02 09:27:07
Sorry... Increased in price, not value... Whilst in many cases decreasing in weight. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:55:42
Also sold my ETH and LTC... I may come to regret it but I figured it was worth the risk to buy back in when the price is lower
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:47:50
I just sold, will re-buy at between 2800 and 3000
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:11:08
Hopefully! Might be a slow recline or it could skyrocket... There will be a lot of uncertainty around BTC for a while I think.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:03:16
This is just the beginning. 
I just SODL everything to buy back when it drops and then HODL 
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:24:16
I sold yesterday, I bought back in at 3300, I only managed to increase my portfolio by about 4%, it really wasn't worthwhile for the amount of stress that it caused! 
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:42:04
Possibly but it's currently 10pm in China so I doubt it

Kinda goes against what crypto is all about.
BTC = Decentralized, mostly anonymous currency that essentially makes every holder their own bank.
PayPal = Centralized, corporate company linked to banks with a history of freezing accounts. PayPal also have to hand over everything to HMR / the tax man if requested.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:47:33
I call $3000

Bitcoin isn't a get rich quick scheme.  
Short term... nobody can tell you what will happen. Personally, I think it could go up from here, or it could go down. Therefore, I'll invest some now, some more in a weeks time, some more the following week and so on. Long term predictions are good. Short term TA is a joke and Bitcoin laughs in the face of it.

Do you think he'll accept Bitcoin?  
How many Bitcoins are your lawnmowers worth kind sir?
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:35:48
I'm confused.

First paragraph:
Colourful Canadian Calvin Ayre, founder of Bitcoin Cash and now one of the figureheads of BTC Satoshi Vision, says the flagship cryptocurrency will become worthless in 2019.
