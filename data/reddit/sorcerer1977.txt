I just keep hodl currency on the Ledger for peace of mind and a bit on the exchanges to trade.
Bit risky keeping them on exchanges but you can miss oppurtunities sometimes.

LocalBitcoin isn't too bad. I sell on there quite a lot. Buyers can transfer cash straight to your account.

Some English even start talking like Americans as  well sometimes it does my head in.
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:40:59
Your post was quite upsetting to me because you said Period instead of Full stop and you are not American.

I'd probably swerve Phuket altogether as it's the HIV capital of Thailand. Have fun though!

We can't all be high rollers.Half a BTC isn't peanuts. It's about a quarter of the average wage in England.

No need to rub it in

I panic sold a couple at £ 6300 but still hodling some.
Bad move but It did give me a bit of piece of mind.Can't cope with the anxiety.

The Brexit deal might be an influence.

Ok i'll bet 0.5 bitcoin on your prediction. If it goes as you say I should be able to turn that into 1 bitcoin maybe more.
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:25:49
Sold at about $8055 so you aren't too far off so far. Made about £150. Nice one!

In UK you can offset capital gains losses against gains.
 I'm not sure how long they will allow this as I bought a long time ago and only Cashed some out this year.
 I can gamble on the price and if I lose it just comes out of my forthcoming tax bill.

If you are down on your investment obviously that's reason to be depressed. But it's still up 500 per cent from this time last year. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 13:47:25
I'm the same. I cashed out a few a bit back which gave me something almost invaluable which is more free time. Just see what happens now. I wouldn't want a Lambo anyway it's a nobs car.

It's an Americanism which everyone over there understands so I suppose it's fine. But now people in England have started saying it which is definitely not fine.
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:59:08
They are classed as capital gains tax in UK and the rate actually seems quite generous to me. I though it would be more.
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:35:25
You're right.Not trying to rub it in but I did keep a few from that time. I always new taking class A drugs would work out well for me in the end.

Just read a story in the Independent saying an Indonesian Islamic scholar has declared bitcoin Halal. Maybe that's influenced the price increase.

If I want to sell for sterling I sell exclusively on Local Bitcoins via bank transfer.
 I've always been happy and never been ripped off. Although some people have been.
 It's sometimes a bit annoying when someone accepts a trade and then waits to see what the market does before they complete. But other than that it seems OK to me.
@_date: 2018-04-19 20:28:09
Maybe if you are in the US. 
It's only decent value for me as exchanges seem to deal in Euros and Dollars and I avoid the exchange rate.
But it  might be worth a try some people might not want to sign up to an exchange.

Nice one pal what a buzz it is. I'd be bored without bitcoin.
