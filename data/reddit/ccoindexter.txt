Thanks for the info. This is the sort of info I need.

Electrum mobile app is new and not ideal.
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:59:07
But how is it "quite buggy?"

If my hot ~~water~~ wallet is in a non-admin account without sudo rights, escalated permissions shouldn't matter right? Not possible on such an account?
Also -- and this is a more serious matter -- even though I could edit the .electrum folder permissions, is it really necessary? My wallet files inside that folder are encrypted, right? Theoretically, I should be able to upload the .electrum folder here, to reddit without worry???

Does this mean keeping my wallet on a USB, or typing in the seed every time I want to use electrum in TAILS?

Only the chrome extension will update the firmware though... right? Not that I want to do that too often.

Not me. I don't want to DL that fat-ass chain.
@_date: 2016-06-15 14:15:11
Why is it best to do it this way? Reasons?

Water = Wallet (autocorrect).
Anyway, my password is like a 50 digit random string made with a password generator. Still, extra precautions never hurt. Thanks for the reply!

Advantages of Copay over electrum? Aren't they pretty much feature compatible?

I don't mind being associated. I only use electrum through a vpn, and I'm not doing anything illegal...
Note: I would run core or armory if it supported trezor and if hard disk space wasn't an issue.

Well fuck. No more VM then.
