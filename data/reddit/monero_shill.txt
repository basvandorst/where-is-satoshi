Furthermore, jackenape, you merely need to intercept the nuclear launch code traffic and whatever traffic you'd like to have plaintext, then while you're offline DECRYPT it using the fraudulent key you just produced. There's not any reason why you couldn't do BOTH Bitcoin and nuclear launch codes.

NSA rolls their own crypto on TOP of the open source cryptography they use to protect nuclear launch codes, personal secrets, and a variety of other critical infrastructure components. Why the fuck would you think it's limited to some open source software?

"good luck enforcing it"
You're foolish if you think the various cryptocurrency companies currently dedicated to aiding LE and Defense Contractors aren't mining a public blockchain used for the majority of online drug trafficking. 
"Once you regulate away the freedom of bitcoin it will instantly become a shitcoin and people will go somewhere else where liberty and security and anonymity are key elements."
I agree that people flock toward freedom everytime, however, that ain't going to be bitcoin in my opinion. Do you think that an exchange in 2026 would accept coins coming from Satoshi's wallet? Or a drug-market wallet? Of course not. Do you think that vendors won't be getting popped for what they're doing right now in 5 years time? A LOT will. People must figure out a solution for anonymity if you want the idea of "clean" and "dirty" to go away. We must make the currency fungible.
"Turning bitcoin to shit coin by promoting this fallacy about dirty and clean coins and bowing to the same government and law enforcement tyranny Satoshi was against, is essentially financial censorship."
I agree that this is financial censorship...but let's define what we're talking about: dirty coins. I think dirty coins are coins that **CAN BE** be censored, seized, or investigated because some criminal investigation has led to them of being suspect. Outside of marked bills, one cash dollar bill is JUST as good as one other cash dollar bill. Are bitcoins coming from the hacked Mt Gox wallet just as good as the ones being mined now? How about the ones from Bitfinex? Or Sheep Marketplace? What if Adolf Hitler or ISIS had a wallet? Would L/E let people keep those coins? NO. They're able to be blacklisted. They're censor-able. That makes them DIRTY.
"It is scary anybody in the bitcoin community would endorse an idea like this, especially when it is a core developer pushing the idea."
I think what you're saying is right...and wrong. Its right in the spirit that, YES, people endorsing censorship is bad and but it's wrong in the sense that merely acknowledging there are coins used in transactions that can limit people's freedom isn't an "endorsement" of throwing people in jail and hunting them down. 
"Bitcoin needs mainstream acceptance by people not regulators and bankers, and their law enforcers."
much agreed bother. However, we cannot ensure they operate within the Constitution, or their oaths to protect our RIGHTS (most important). So this is why, we must create the technology in a way that they do not have the ability to even have the chance to violate our rates. We'll be accountable for ourselves. It's very sad that L/E today cannot be trusted enough to actually investigate serious crimes enough because they're too busy busting drug dealers, kids smoking weed and snorting coke on Prom night, and writing tickets.

International coordinated plans to unite sovereign governments don't exist and never have. There's definitely not such a thing as globalism or globalists, and they certainly don't hold powerful positions within sovereign nations and work together with other powerful people in powerful sovereign nations under the pretense of founding international governments. You know, these conspiracy theorists that keep trying to say things like "new world order" are really stupid. Sure, various super-politicians and power-brokers refer to the "new world order" as a noun and speak about it in the exact same context of global governance with one another on the world stage all the time, and emphasize the importance of the United Nations and League of Nations, but again, it doesn't exist. These theorists are really reaching. There's zero evidence that global conspiracies ever happen, or ever will. There's definitely not 10-30 governments pushing for cashless economies and putting unnecessary parameters on the legitimacy of cash transactions...like everyday. It's not happening.

80% of worldwide hashrate = they'd move to other pools and use VPNs
say they shut down top 3 chinese exchanges = would kill the price, but darknet/bitsquare/US exchanges would still work
declare ownership illegal = people would still use it, might inflate price of bitcoin even more
lets say block bitcoin searches on baidu/google = thats illegal, and unprecedented, but people would just search it on TOR
yes, in all cases of these, the price would likely tank, but the network would still be functional, people would still be able to use bitcoin and trade in bitcoin so long as people are willing to accept and as you know, trade is global. they cant make it illegal worldwide.

Not if you have things of real value like land, water, guns, food, precious metals. Their value isn't as dependent on abstractions in mathematics.


I was here for the DAO and have been very involved for the past 5 years, passively for longer. You are A) talking about a vulnerability within one single timelocked fund, not a protocol level vulnerability within the lower level of the ETH protocol. B) Lots of people still lost their money C) it split the Ethereum chain into two D) The economy of that market was *tiny*. Absolutely miniscule. In an actual global economy that rivals that of developed nations, simply rolling back to a specific point doesn't alleviate the problems of the **legitimate** transactions that happened after the vulnerability was found and exploited by a surreptitious attacker. 




First of all, it's extremely possible. Cryptography, like all forms of computer science, are flawed by human design. Bitcoin **has** flaws in it both technically and stragetically. If someone or some group were to have surreptitiously spent the outputs of various peoples balances under the radar back with the same bug found in 2010 while allowing 90% of transactions to go untampered then when the time comes to roll back the chain, you are rolling back 100% of the chain. We don't have the time, organization, or trust to know **which** transactions were actually belonging to real victims or people posing as victims, so the chain would just be rolled back to some arbitrary point before we can spot the bug. What if there was a second bug unbeknownst that was also being exploited? Furthermore, if we actually had people with quantum computers bruteforcing keys and we have to change the curve then HOW do these people attain their new private keys? Magic? How do I get my 1000 BTC private key given to me? How does Grandma and Grampa get their new keys? How do the ridiculously bloated and incompetent governments achieve the same thing? There are a lot more flaws in cryptocurrencies than fans care to admit. 


Dude if you already "know" what's going and what's not going to happen to Bitcoin then you are a lost cause. This is coming from a Bitcoiner of 7 years. Believe me, I've been caught up in the delusional mania before, you're either unaware of the current flaws or overlooking them. Bitcoin has serious potential to change the world in a drastic and dramatic way, but NOT right now. It's too young of a technology.

Show me a single implementation of ECC that isn't based on software. How the hell are you sitting here arguing semantics that cryptography isn't software when literally 100% of modern cryptography is dependent on PRNG's? What do you roll your crypto with? Rotational ciphers? Sure, *technically* speaking you can perform some serious cryptography on pen and paper these days, but jesus christ.....LOL


Oh so there's no flaws in random number generators? No flaws in curves? Surely, ECDSA has **zero** flaws! It will go on forever! /s
 


I remember hearing that about MD5 &amp; SHA1. Then there were. Is it sinking in that you actually *don't* know what you're talking about as much as you think you do? 


I didn't say it would be the primary thing, I'm just saying it would devastate the ecosystem and depending on the maturity of the market "Bitcoin" would likely be replaced by some other cryptocurrency or it would die until solutions are found. If it underpinned the global economy the adversaries using the attack likely wouldn't try and make it glaringly obvious if they were in it for financial gain. If they were simply out to undermine the system because it threatened them, *why wouldn't "they" target Bitcoin?*

It really doesn't work so simply. Intelligence and military communities roll their own crypto on top of the open source crypto that exists all the itme. I agree that open source crypto is widely deployed and could wreak havoc if broken, but there are back up plans to be mobilized immediately in the case of these things happening for people like Chase, BOA, WF, etc and most of the critical military systems which national security is dependent on.  These systems are maintained by centralized organizers whom can arbitrarily mediate without having to establish some form of consensus among the larger population. Bitcoin can't do that quickly. Bitcoin network can barely move along on simple issues and are extremely susceptible to sybil manipulations from various nation states.




No. Food and valuable items will also be currency as well. So have a gun. Have food. Have some bitcoin. Gold is easy to melt if you're smart enough to figure out basic metallurgy. You're just kinda proving my point here. Maybe you're too young to know, but economies existed *before* cryptography and that's still the case.


Haha... Obviously Auwardamn, if there was a bug in the crypto to where **ANYONE** could produce a valid private key that belongs to an address that is not their own then you have a lil problem on your hands... Maybe you should read more thoroughly through the "rant". I'm not saying Bitcoin can't work. I'm saying Bitcoin won't and more importantly SHOULDN'T do what people are saying anytime soon. It shouldn't overtake the dollar or replace nation states currencies. The system is still too fragile. 


Yeah, but 2 secs ago you were telling me BTC can't have fraudulent transactions. Go talk to the guys from Monero folks working on cryptonote protocol whom were just susceptible to quadruple spends due to a bug in the range proof and tell me that there isn't a possibility for fraudulent transactions when Bitcoin plans on implementing papers like Confidential Transactions. You were wrong straight up and can't just say, OK I'm wrong. You're one of those.

there's not a variety of other scenarios that occur. You are talking as if Bitcoin's problems are all solvable. Tomorrow we could find a vulnerability in all cryptography where everyone can steal everyone's Bitcoins. Yes, the same crypto is used on a great deal of important financial systems, but they are reversible. Crypto is not the same, especially if there is an organized attack that litters the chain with fraudulent/compromised transactions. I'm not saying that crypto will not reach X amount of dollars, I'm simply stating that *so* much money has moved in *so* quickly that the guys who are manipulating the markets will not be able to resist on the easy money of causing people to panic sell (i.e. crash)

I'm not an expert, but I think I have a decent grasp on it. bitcoins are the reward that "miners" get for brute forcing numbers in an attempt to find the factors of a very large semi-prime number. If a miner has a higher hash rate, it means they can guess more numbers more quickly. This means that a higher hash rate has a better chance of solving the problem and finding the factors to the semi-prime number. Prime numbers are numbers who only have a factor of 1 and themselves (i.e 3 is a prime number. It's only factors are 1 and 3. There are no two integers that can be multiplied to produce a 3 other than these two numbers). Semiprime numbers are similar. They are numbers whose only factors are 1, itself, two other numbers. Through some mathematical magic, we can force the creation of numbers that will always be semi-prime, without knowing the factors to create them. The only way that we have of to find the factors is by trying every single possible combo. That's what "mining" is. The act of "solving the problem" is what we call solving a block. When that happens, the miner receives a set of public and private keypairs (these keys are the actual bitcoins) which authorize him to sign and prove his balance is legit and other nodes check to make sure that the block he found is valid, and is the most recent block found. Before the miner receives his money for finding the answer to the most recent block, he takes a group of pending transactions from a pool of transactions (this is called the mempool) that have yet to be verified as authentic and verifies them. He scoops them up into a group called a block, shows the network that they're all legit and then autographs the block with proof that he possesses the private key corresponding to a public address. The other miners and nodes check it, and once people all agree, they move onto the next problem. Because every node checks that all the transactions contain valid signatures are corresponding to a block somewhere along the previously established chain of transactions, through magic mathematics fraud is essentially not a worry and easily checkable unless the attacker has a near (theoretically) impossible amount of computing power or there is a bug. **The bitcoins are the reward for securing the blockchain, and the only point of securing the chain is the reward.** When people say that they think "blockchain" is great but bitcoin is unnecessary, they're saying that we can have all the benefits of tamper proof records, decentralized payments, etc without having a currency attached to it. People generally say this because they misunderstand what they're talking about and are parroting finance guys who either A) don't understand what they're talking about B) are intentionally deceiving people to distract them from the facts so they can either profit from some rinky dink invention of theirs or just dissuade people from ditching the banking system.

Your point? Is Raytheon evil for selling missiles and bombers? They serve a singular purpose, death and destruction. One man's terrorist is another mans freedom fighter.


Right. Because that'd be a very stupid move to try and defend the case from that angle, especially without evidence. He already served up an admission that he operated the site by the time the nefarious agents were found. They'd be better off defending the case on some other merits than trying to use "The government is shady" conspiracy angle (despite the fact that it's true). The point is however, it's certainly not an unreasonable doubt after seeing the behavior of multiple agents involved that they'd be willing to set this man up, lie, cheat the case, steal, etc.


It's already been acknowledged there were multiple DPR's acting and to say that beyond a shadow of a doubt that HE was one that ordered the hit or knew about it doesn't seem to be exclusive from "He's not DPR".


I'm assuming the evidence you're referring to is chat logs, and journal entries correct? How are you so sure that it was Ross Ulbricht acting as DPR, as opposed to some other character? How can you prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he indeed WAS the DPR that ordered the hit and **why has that yet to be proven in a court of law?** I've yet to see any evidence on the record that his personal journal showed evidence of ordering a hit.


Show me the journal entries in his handwriting or some way to prove that he wrote them and I'd believe you. You're talking about a case where multiple agencies were completely embarassed and had multiple agents try to fuck this man over and make off with deca-millions. To say that his computer couldn't have been compromised (considering SilkRoad was hacked multiple times) is like saying El Chapo's computer can't be compromised.

 you never answered the question of WHY you assume there is only one DPR and how there *is't a reasonable doubt* he is telling the truth in that he never ordered a hit?


no. but they do exist, right ?


Ahhh so we're in agreement that there is a reasonable doubt that it could have been compromised right? Does that, along with the fact that "the hit" aspect was handled by Carl Force not sit a *little* eery that it very well could have either A) been a fabrication by Force along with other corrupt agents or B) been other than original DPR ?

I agree that the bitcoin price economy could be relatively decimated and disjointed by it being banned/targeted by governments more intensely. However, there is a chance that some governments could establish it as a safe-haven human rights deal or something, but who knows how that would turn out. Do you think the drug markets would disappear as well? However, there might be the whole "analog" avenue for cryptocurrency. Say if they ban "Bitcoin" perhaps they can just make "Shitcoin"... It will probably end up being a "licensed thing".......
