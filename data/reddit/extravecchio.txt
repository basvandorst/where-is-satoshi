Wait...that would imply you don't want them to clear... do you think that all of those transactions should be stuck forever?  That seems a bit odd and controlling. :\

What gets me is that the majority of txns in each block are still around 200 sats...  smh

What does that word “conspiracy“ mean? I am not sure it means what you think it means.  ;)
No “conspiracy” here, as I recall Joseph and Thaddeus released the original white-paper around late summer of 2015, it will be 2018 in a few days, seemed like a fair time to check back in.
As a sidenote, though I personally happen to disagree with off-chain transactions for Bitcoin, I do respect their development efforts and the vast amount of time and implementation labor that went into creating the solutions for the problems they are trying to solve, from a professional level.

@_date: 2017-12-28 03:15:25
Conspiracies and defeatist mentality?!    Where the heck did you that from?  Lol, paranoid much?  
I simply asked the bot to remind me in a few years if LN got off the ground.  It’s been over two years, figured 50% more would be enough time to check back and see how things panned out... That’s a problem or a conspiracy somehow?

Actually, it is not a “false narrative”, though that term seems to be bandied about quite frequently, seemingly by those who do not understand its definition.
The possibility of a 51% attack is a reality, especially as certain portions of the miners dedicate their hash rate to other chains.  Ignoring it as if it can’t happen and that if / when it does everyone (the miners) will play nice is just ‘ostraching’ - you are not offering up any real technical info and I think you misunderstand the technology.
By its design, segwit removes the signatures, There is still a hash proving that they occurred, but they are effectively untraceable after that point.  Stating otherwise such as you did when you stated that “it is still a blockchain of signatures” is patently incorrect, The signatures are discarded...  imagine you sign a contract and another party signs a contract but you do not receive a copy of the signatures all you have is an intermediary third-party who basically can verify that the contract was signed, but it can never provide your signature or the other parties’ signature.
Segwit Prioritizes transactions over signatures, assuming that the signature ID is no longer relevant after the transaction. This creates a conundrum for later verification, several legal experts I have spoken to are also highly concerned about it, but that is a topic for another thread.
Understanding the vast ramifications of separating the signature from the transaction is difficult for most folks who are not computer scientists.
The main point here is that all you have left after the fact is an effective third-party verification.  After you and your other parties have signed the contract, a third-party has now torn off the signatures off the bottom (to save space?) and made xerox copies handed both parties copies and said “yeah guys, they were signed” ...
This by nature breaks the definition of “Bitcoin” which is a blockchain comprised of signatures.  Think on that one.

What about Apple Gold?  Apple Cash?  ;)
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:04:48
You said “There are no negative aspects” and “it &lt;Segwit&gt; increases ... security, “
Just want you to know that’s patently wrong.
Segwit by its very nature reduces security, causes more complexity, and incentives miners to take advantage.
No matter how you spin it, adding complexity reduces security.  Maths, man.

The Coinbase reward are the coins issued to the miner who discovered the block, sometimes refereed to as the ‘block reward’ - currently 12.5 BTC per block.
Miners also generate revenue through the transaction fees associated with each transaction, these were intended in the Bitcoin white paper to remain relative inconsequential and to eventually replace the block rewards as an incentive to miners (ostensibly to keep the network alive when there are no more Coinbase rewards).
One of the current challenges is that the existing situation has incentivized miners NOT to use more efficient solutions as the fees have just recently surpassed the block reward in size.   BTC mined a block worth 12.5 in Coinbase reward but which contained 13.1 BTC of fees.  
This was never supposed to happen, and now there is a large conundrum as there are obvious financial disincentives for the network to become more efficient, virtual rock meets virtual hard place!

It is somewhat complex but there exists an attack mechanism by which miners could signal Segwit, and then band together, disable it and therefore take advantage of the “spendable by anyone” addresses which are required to make Segwit work.
And let’s remember that separating signatures from transactions voids one of the major purposes of transacting with crypto.
As a mathematician it makes no sense and certainly does not offer any increased security, in fact it does the opposite.

I've been saying for a while, don't put more into BTC than you would on red or black.
That said, this is not a traditional bubble, those have mostly been issues with supply and market manipulation.  This is a paradigm shift of the world's wealth into the digital era.  Anyone not getting involved will be left behind.
Can you imagine if you listened to someone saying "Don't worry about that 'internet' thing, it's just a fad." back in 1995?!
That said, bitcoin will be the digital gold of the new era, and other cryptos / platforms will more likely act like cash.  Beware what you are buying into with blockchain purchases, always follow the four rules.
