Well it *is* in many ways like the dotcom bubble. Remember during the dotcom bubble, investors spent crazy amounts of money to buy shares in companies simply because they had a website. It was speculative at best. People believed (and rightly so in many cases, in retrospect) that the internet would go mainstream and early adopters of the internet would be the most successful. Of course, as we know now, most of these companies were overvalued or basically just junk companies with a website but no good business model.
The value bitcoin has is mainly speculative. Believers in the currency (and not just the tech) are driving up the price based on what they believe on what the future of the financial world would look like (involving a lot of bitcoin transactions). Will they be proven to be correct, or will btc end up as pets.com? We have no idea.

What? It's up like 150 to 200% since 2010. And the economy from the point of view of the companies that make up Berkshire Hathaway (with Apple, Wells Fargo, Kraft-Heinz, BoA, Coke, and American Express making up over 60%), the economy's been doing great. These are companies whose products and services real Americans (and millions of non-Americans) use.

It doesn't make sense to compare one share of BRK.A with one bitcoin. They are both arbitrary amounts of each. Why not compare 25.8483 BTC with 3 shares of BRK? If anything, you would have to compare market caps. But why compare with the market cap of BRK, and not gold or AMZN or the US dollar?

Because the population of the US continues to grow and therefore consume more. The Dow or the S&amp;P 500 or NASDAQ track the values of many, many companies whose products and services millions of Americans use. Since the US hasn't collapsed nor is it expected to collapse any time soon, we can expect these indices to grow.
Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general, cannot really be compared to those indices in terms of growth. For 1 BTC to be worth over a million dollars would require a huge, very noticeable change in the way we (the world's population) save and/or transfer money. We are talking fundamental changes with regards to using gold (which is extremely common in many countries), the stock market, as well as banks in general. It certainly seems absurd to me, and a trend line isn't going to change most people's view.

BTC did not increase 373% in the past year. OP's ownership of BTC did. Bitcoin is worth less today than it did a year ago, but is 220% up since two years ago. It's a confusing pic.
