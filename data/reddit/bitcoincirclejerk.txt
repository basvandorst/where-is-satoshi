But no one knows if it's going to rise. ETF rejection could send this thing towards $500 in the next hour.

Hu? Did the rbitcoin policy change? Your post will absolutely be deleted. BU is considered an altcoin in this subreddit.

Wouldn't the "original" chain still exist? Only under attack and (maybe temporarily) unusable?

so what if the moon would change its orbit to match the reduced gold price? Mind blown.

Over the years i had like 10 accounts subscribed to this sub and 0 to rbtc. By that calculation rbitcoin subs are actually lower sorry.

So 2018, 2019? 
Maybe we will even see a 1500 per BTC but BTC won't be the market leader anymore.

Sold 50% of my bitcoins after i couldn't even send some without paying $1+ or wait for hours on end. My best decision yet as the price was $1240+. Will buy back waaay lower.

Don't be naive. The most open "secret" is that blockstream is owned by AXA which is intentionally blocking development? lulz.

If you acknowledge MtGox ATH you must also acknowledge Gemini ATH at $2200.

All miners broke the agreement? If not that's not a reason for core to fuck over all other miners.
@_date: 2017-03-02 21:19:59
Mind blown.

There will be no compromise. If you think any of the both sides care about bitcoin more than they care about themselves you are wrong. 
That's why we will end up with BU. It will be the trump or brexit of bitcoin.
Segwit is dead so now it's stagnation vs. BU. And BU will win eventually.

Huh? Are you new to reddit? Unfortunately almost all subreddits are circlejerks. Reddit itself isn't really suited for open discussions, mainly because of the voting system. A traditional forum is better for that.
@_date: 2016-12-23 21:27:48
Remember: buy high sell low.

Investment? You mean speculation? Bitcoin is great to gamble some money on it. Chances and risks are huge but nobody knows what it will do next. 
Certain events with a non-impossible chance could send it to $10k or $10 next month.


Look at the charts. It crashes EVERY TIME after a huge rise. The question is only how high it will go.
@_date: 2016-12-23 21:05:57
Uhm, but it did also go parabolic in april 2013. Only for the real bubble still to come.
@_date: 2016-12-27 19:16:27
More like 10x max. Bubble territory is $5k - $10k in january.
@_date: 2016-12-27 19:47:18
Oh god. You are the guy who just posts 24/7 in the ether subreddits and screams "buy buy buy!" as it goes down to shit lol.
@_date: 2015-08-20 11:14:25
It's an embarrassingly bad fake. 
"Pretender-bitcoin" is a dead giveaway.
 If you read through Satoshis post you quickly realize he would never use such phrases.


It's kind of sad that the fakers are too dumb to fake Satoshis writing style. 
They probably thought "2 spaces are good enough lol".
@_date: 2015-04-05 11:10:45
True! Can't wait to get rich.
@_date: 2015-04-05 17:42:53
Now is the best time to invest in Bitcoin. Price is low and new bubble will start soon. Who cares about debt, bitcoin is a sure bet to multiply your money! Don't miss the train!
@_date: 2015-04-05 11:22:03
That's what you get if you try to mess with BITCOIN! They must feel really silly now.
@_date: 2016-05-07 16:24:12
Ok, lets say we are stable at $1.6m daily. After halving we have +$800k daily. Makes $292m yearly in addition. Sounds good but that's only about 4% of the total market capitalization. Which sounds really insigificant if you consider bitcoin is 95% speculation.
