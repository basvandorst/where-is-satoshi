Probably someone who made a lot of money already off of Bitcoin.

They have a page that they talk about it here: 
It doesn't say exactly where the prices come from.

Maybe but I’m not really sure how that’d work. They sell it to other people with enough money to cause liquidations on other exchanges where the actual trading happens? Why is that more believable than say any of those exchanges leaking information about their positions so that people on there can stop hunt and cause mass cascading liquidations on there?
I just struggle to see how Bitmex is relevant.

The problem with this idea is that Bitmex isn’t an exchange...so they don’t have an order book or any trading activity. Their prices come from other exchanges. So unless we think they have insiders at other exchanges and enough capital to cause liquidations on those exchanges to move the price then it seems unlikely.
I think it’s more likely that their price calculation mechanism is shady.

Because Bitmex isn’t an exchange. There is no order book. It is a futures market. Their prices come from other exchanges. Sure they could be trading on another exchange with a lot of money to influence the price and thus mess with their own customers but I’d say it’s more likely that they skim money off of people with a dodgy pricing mechanism that people don’t notice because it’s so minute.

These are liquidations, meaning that the entire trade position had to be closed due to full losses that were not covered by collateral. This means a loss of 100% of your investment, basically. The system had to close your position because you reached 100% losses. It can’t allow you to incur more than that in losses because then money is coming from nowhere.
When someone invests 1k with 100x leverage, it means that their trade position is 100k. This doesn’t mean they invested 100k, they only invested 1k. It also means that a 1% change in price results in a gain or loss of 100% of your investment. A 1% decrease on your 100k position would mean a loss of 1k, which is 100% of your investment, thus meaning the system has to close your trade or otherwise known as “liquidate your position”.
People do this because you can make gains as if you’re investing 100k, while only having 1k but you’re also subject to far more risk because just as a 1% increase will double your investment, a 1% decrease is a complete loss of your investment.
Hope that explains it.

I said this in another thread and someone replied saying that the average leverage on Bitmex is 8x, so it’d be more like 3.3m.
Either way yes, it’s worth pointing out to people that these liquidations are often far less than what it shows due to leverage.
Also, in general I find the activity on Bitmex to be questionable at best. We don’t really know how they calculate prices or where they get it from, just that it’s a “fair market price” according to their FAQ.

Yes but there's no login on this website...it's just a simple page. there's nothing wrong with just viewing a site that only serves http.

What exactly would go wrong just because you visited a site that only serves http and not https...?
