If you don't have access to that kind of money you shouldn't be putting it in bitcoin.

It's really not. At all...

I was expecting it to be some math/tech thing that there is no actual way to fix this part of the technology.

When I look at this subreddit I only see people who hold bitcoin (I mean its like the biggest joke here, ffs)
because they want to sell it at some point for "real money". They aren't *using* it.
Looking at this subreddit, no one actually uses bitcoin as actual money.
It's all just a game. Seems like not even the majority of users here trust its primary purpose.
I'm not sure what that means but its definitely not the point of cryptocurrency and it made me a little more skeptical about the whole thing since subscribing here.

Please do an online scavenger hunt as well, not just physical!
I'm in europe :)
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:27:27
A fair point!
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:07:32
Can you explain why there is no way to fix it? Asking out of interest
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:09:28
Nice conspiracy theory. Like a crypto illuminati? You should be a fantasy writer!

It's a bunch of people making completely misunderstanding the entire purpose of bitcoin into a meme by saying you have to just hold it forever (until when?) as if its just an investment and not a currency.
Funnily enough this whole thing shows distrust in very purpose of bitcoin.
Also this is said over and over because holding is better for all other people, so repeating it helps your bottom line.
In reality you should sell sensibly and whenever you need to, maybe a part of your bitcoins at least. Holding blindly/unconditionally as these eejits suggest is fucking retarded.

I was tipped 0.01 BTC on reddit ages ago, and now that's €160.
So I know its easy and pretty amazing to transfer money with it.
Only problem is I dont see the 0.01 BTC as money. I will likely hold it for ages and ages and then transfer it to usable currency. But things might change, of course.

That's an interesting way of looking at it.

This post is the lube to a circlejerk.

Awful design
@_date: 2019-08-11 22:58:11
I'm all for Bitcoin but if I found an ad on my money I'd be fucking pissed and never buy any.
@_date: 2019-08-22 12:28:27
What are you talking about? Are you saying people will accept their worth fluctuating wildly and dynamically all the time?
Yeah I'm sure people across the world will accept fundamental instability.... /s

It's a 12k car... same thing.

They even have a prediction by Tai fucking Lopez. Lmfao
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:01:40
Yes because the dollar is the only other currency!
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:32:52
Seems fair if you're up front about it.
I wouldn't compare working at spacex with a normal job. It's genuine world-changing stuff. Very high demands, very high results. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:00:06
Nice way handling good criticism.
@_date: 2018-07-29 20:31:44
No, since driving a car isn't illegal and not even close to as harmful. What a stupid fucking argument. I would delete my comment if I had written that shit.
@_date: 2018-07-29 23:18:33


Let's normalise that statistic using the amount of drug-uses vs car-uses, "retard". Not even worth having any discussion with if you are this thick.
@_date: 2018-07-29 20:29:53
I understand your frustration but why in the fuck would that mean letting this guy free is justice? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:28:33
You fund artists, eh? ;)
