Puny human only look at short-term. Puny human forget what happen when you take revolutionary technology and give time. Puny human forget what internet did to human kind in 2 decades. Puny human should shut up and hold.

Why not a 3% bond as well to diversify? Hell, why not into a pension fund that will pay him back when he is 75. :)

This is what happens when society places too much respect on one individual. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. It might turn out to be great that Ver is publicly supporting BCH - because if and when BCH goes bust (possibly after the intro of lightning network) he will suddenly find himself in a situation of irrelevance and past-glory. Carry on Ver.

I thought this was a bitcoin subreddit. Could we please stop with the Bcash articles? Who gives a fuck about Bcash here? Apparently a lot of people.

Not to mention an ideal medium for drugs, terrorism and kidnapping. I'm surprised the Government hasn't cracked down on the Fed yet. It's quite unacceptable. USD should be temporarily banned until they fix this stuff. They are probably just getting ready to use BTC level 2 before they do that.

Cash? As in Bitcoin Cash?

It's an exceptional book on economics and history of money. I'm loving every bit of it.

Why are we still having this conversation? BCH has reached the abyss of irrelevance.

We salute you sir. Every node matters. ;)

Buy a whole lotta food in one go? Like a month's supply?
@_date: 2017-08-30 09:06:56
Yes, I have heard they import the food from another country using BTC. Which country do they import from?

Thank you Sir, I've updated it now.

I was going to say no, but after reading this, I changed my mind. Agreed.

...and the USA, Russia, China, South Korea, Australia, Nigeria, India, Canada, Germany, France, Spain, Brazil, Argentina, South Africa, etc. &amp;nbsp;
Everybody deserves a thank you.

Hey sir, I wouldn't be too worried if you're diversified enough, but that opinion is effectively coming from the miners who recently started shifting to mine BCH. It is therefore a very highly biased opinion, most likely with something going on in the background that we are not aware of. I do not think any outcome is certain with &gt;80% certainty right now with the information that we currently have, but both the coins dying is always a **possibility** even though not a likelihood. I recommend keeping up to date with the mining power distribution.
Best wishes.

Does difficulty have **anything** to do with usage or transaction volume?

See what you did to the price when you asked this question? :D

How long will the old man last as the CEO? He will eventually be replaced (naturally or kicked out by investors) and give way to somebody who realises what bitcoin is offering to the people around the world. 
I think it is a great sign that the price is continuing to rise or stabilise in spite of such folly.

No that is not normal and should not be normal. I have tried multiple exchanges - Coinbase, Coinfloor, Bitstamp, Kraken, Bittrex, Binance, Poloniex, Bitfinex.
In short I can say that for UK citizens Bitstamp and Kraken seem to be the cheapest (lowest fees) and least hassle. If you do decide to transfer large sums of money, however, they will start asking KYC questions - which you are not legally forced to answer.
Most importantly, however, do get a Fidor account as they are reliable and offer SEPA transfers for only £2.49.
