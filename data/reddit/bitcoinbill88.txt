Andreas Antonopolous (the Author) puts it on Github for free access himself. So shut up, I'm not trying to pirate anything

He’s got me wanting to buy more even at these prices. What I want to know though is if AA still thinks Bitcoin will be the best of its kind or if he thinks an altcoin will take over. To me (and I honestly didn’t watch the video just read the chapter in TIOM) it sounds like it’s the decentralized Blockchain technology (not necessarily bitcoin) that’s going to be (is) the game changer.

Transfer the ones you want to hold to a paper wallet. The ones you want to sell, I would just sell through Coinbase (expect a small fee). There is probably a $15,000 dollar limit per day so it will take a couple of days. Congrats, btw... this is a big deal!

It’s true, and the fact that this post is nowhere near front page makes me sad for this subreddit.  I’d say AA might be on his way to being the ‘Feynman of Crypto’ in terms of his ability to ‘dumb down’ the subject and explain it to the laymen.

Here's the code, couldn't/didn't want to expend the energy to figure out how to post it on GitHub.
     inputs, program needs to compute the numbers for each specific order
    amt_btc = input('Enter total amount of BTC you hold: ' )
    strt_prc = input('At what price (BTC/USD) would you like to begin selling your currency? ')
    prcnt_increase = float(input('At what percentage increase intervals (in price of BTC/USD) would you like to sell your BTC? '))
    prcnt_increase1 = float(prcnt_increase/100)
    amt_sold_USD = input('How much in USD would you like to sell? ')
    amt_orders = input('In how many orders would you like to sell this amount? ')
    
     ('Percent Increase is '+ str(prcnt_increase1))
    
    amt_soldper_iter_USD = float(amt_sold_USD / amt_orders)
    
     the variable 'count'
    count =1 
    
     loop that returns the parameters for each specific loop
    while count&lt;=amt_orders : 
        print('Start price for Order ' + str(count)+ ' is: ' + str(strt_prc))
        amtbtc_sold_count=float(amt_soldper_iter_USD/strt_prc)
        earned=amtbtc_sold_count*strt_prc
        amt_btc = amt_btc-amtbtc_sold_count
        print ('Order ' + str(count) + ' is at ' + str(strt_prc) + ', SELL : '+ str(amtbtc_sold_count)+ ' Bitcoins , You earn: ' +str(earned) +' and you have '+ str(amt_btc)+ ' bitcoin remaining.')
        strt_prc=float(((strt_prc)*(prcnt_increase1))+strt_prc)
        if count&lt;=9:
            print('Start Price for Order ' +str(count+1)+' is ' + str(strt_prc))
        print('')
        count+=1

worked, thanks a lot!

So if I wanted to sell my bitcoin that I’ve technically purchased while BTC is at an all time high I’m just kinda screwed?
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:10:26
I’m not saying I have it, I was presenting a hypothetical situation. Just trying to grasp how Coinbase works is all.
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:25:21
They charged me a $3.00 fee, so I'm not sure that's what it is.
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:35:55
Yeah $3 is 1% of my purchase. So they just artificially raise the price of the bitcoin that I buy to get their tip? Why can't they just take a $3 USD and record the true value of the BTC when I purchased?
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:01:28
You thinking it’s gonna dip that low again??
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:28:54
Then why do they also charge me a $3.00 fee?
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:00:26
I see now. I heard somewhere that bitcoin investors are pretty bad with paying taxes on their profits, is this true or was it just some sort of bash on bitcoin culture?
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:25:51
What is GDAX exactly?
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:17:20
Yeah, i'm a first time buyer and didn't know they did this. I'm definitely going to start using GDAX.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:40:21
Yeah, I agree. But why will it take 10 days for my bitcoin to get into my wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:24:53
No, it's actually giving me a value above the market value.
