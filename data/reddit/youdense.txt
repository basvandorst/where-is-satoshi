This community is toxic

Definitely not a bubble

No one is confiscating your savings. Everyone loses money to inflation, conspiracy aside.

Probably a big $50

Puerto Rico is the answer here 
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:25:04
Definitely not a bubble 
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:35:19
I hope so

Until we reach the cap and the only incentive to mine more is the low fees we are aiming for. Then someone just makes a new currency and the miners switch to it instead. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:11:58
As a community do we not want low transaction fees?
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:19:11
You're a visionary 
@_date: 2017-08-26 20:01:02
Move to Puerto Rico, and you won't have to pay the capital gains tax

Had to check and make sure I wasn’t in r/wallstreetbets

Just download electrum cash, open it, put in your regular BTC wallet password and your BCH should be there already for you to send wherever you want. If not, you'll just have to import the private keys.

Am I not the only who just throws a shirt away after I ruin it? Got that crypto money son 
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:54:16
It is 
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:59:05
Exactly 
@_date: 2017-09-18 22:59:44
I hope it didn't come that wrinkled

The forks are overhyped anyways. A currency is essentially a network good which means they compete for the market rather than just a share. Bitcoin is going to be fine everybody is already using it so the odds of people just up and switching are slim. Think about it, if someone ripped off the iPhone tomorrow people would still keep their iPhones rather than switch to the rip off, right? 
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:58:43
So, hardly anything?
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:39:30
Well, you’ve got 402 after about 6 hours. So, that many or about 1.12 a minute

If you like duolingo, seriously consider trying Lingvist for Spanish. Personally I feel like it’s more useful 
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:22:20
I’m not a big fan of bitcoin but I don’t understand their reasoning. If people think that something like bitcoin is better than the system in place, then why try to fight it? Who cares if it hurts the state, fuck the state 
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:48:04
It’s more learny

Bought litecoin more than a week ago, still says pending 
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:25:48
You can finance wars with bitcoin too 
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:20:28

Well thanks for taking the time to explain 
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:29:51
Yeah I think AB has been the biggest market to date 
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:56:19
Hell yeah, man, congratulations! Remember the Mathew principle, it's just gonna keep coming! 
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:42:54
What makes you think that the people in the 60 percent own a phone capable of making that transaction? 
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:23:50
If someone can't open a bank account, what makes you think they have the internet to buy bitcoin? Explain please 
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:45:55
Cash isn't going anywhere anytime soon
