If the buyer has 15 million in crypto he is well-versed and should be able to explain this to you and your lawyer...if you still feel uncomfortable (I would)...tell that dude if he wants the land he will exchange the 15 million for fiat...I would put like 250K into bitcoin if I came into that much money...rest would go into commercial real-estate...and a lot of cocaine/gambling....

Fuck man congrats thats a hefty sum...if you want to send me money I am broke LMK
I don't understand why you do not discuss this with the buyer? 
You are coming to reddit for this...15 million fucking dollars...

I agree with this bought 1K yesterday and bought 500 on March 21st...
My first time investing...I know its peanuts to most people but to me that is a lot of money...

The only reason I heard about Bitcoin is from the media...from Worldstar Hip Hop of all places LOL almost embarrassed to admit it...I wanted to invest immediately but was way too late obviously...I took a major fascination with crypto following my new found awareness. I bought 1500 worth at about $4800 mark, should've bought it when it was lower...better late than never.
