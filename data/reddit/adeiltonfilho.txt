and only one way of identifying, after all not all transactions need to be pseudo anonymous .... Andreas Antonopoulos uses a BTC address that begins with his name (1andreas3batLhQa2FawWjeyjCqyBzypd) ... this somehow facilitates. although it is still necessary to know the other characters of the BTC address, while in my case it is enough to know the beginning of the email.

I understand, but this proposal is for micro payments. it is obvious that there must be other numerous wallets, but I think it is interesting to have one, where it is possible to deposit just to know my name. even my grandmother would know that.

still it would not be so practical.
@_date: 2018-08-26 03:12:21
Yes! this also helps, but I would like something even more public, in my case my email is my name, whoever knows my name can deposit btc

the issue is not just having access to the internet. there are people who do not know how to use a computer! there are elderly people who do not trust anything that is not physical! there are countries with serious problems in education. this is a real problem ... do you think fair billions of people do not have access to bitcoin?

Is not true! you need to understand virtual security to use bitcoins ... people who do not know are at serious risk ... but the people already know to protect themselves against false bills they already have the usual routine.

and it's obvious that the digital system will evolve and everyone will market Biticoin one day. but have you ever stopped to think about the billionaire market of people who still do not have access to the digital system? Do you think fair people can not somehow use bitcoin?

I do not know what cultures and people you are basing ... but I assure you that there are people with a lot of difficulty to transact digital coins ... I was experiencing this idea that occurred to me ... at no time I want to regress this marvel technology , I just want everyone to have access in some way ... it's just a palliative for these people to evolve into the digital system.

I agree Biticoin is really revolutionary and will change the forms of payments, however this does not happen in an instant, there are people in poor countries who need help to be able to enjoy the technology ... about private key security I disagree, because in a multsig wallet a person just does not have access to the private key!

If, by chance, Fintec decides to print more bills than the quantity of bitcoins that exist in the multsig portfolio, it will not be possible for the merchant to exchange the bills for Biticoins, that is, the fintec would not be able to pay the merchant in bitcoins, has incentives to maintain the correct amount of BTC bill issues.

Demand is important for any asset in an economy. But for a coin this is essential! Investors form the price of BTC today, speculating mainly on its adoption as currency and means of payment in the future. But over time, if this adoption does not increase, it will entail a new pricing of its value, having a negative effect on its price, reducing investments for the future. Relying on LN alone can be very risky if currencies like BCH are already ready as a means of payment. Speculators arise and disappear! Make the currency volatile! Consumers no! Consumers when they adhere to currency for day to day trading make the process more economically robust and therefore less volatile! Which leads to increased stability and even more adoption in a virtuous cycle. Today BTC is bad for micropayments, and that's a serious problem!

Technically you are correct ... But in reality for the merchant who received the payment in your wallet, and needs to deliver the product, was hit by a double expense, because the money from your wallet returned to the criminal's wallet!  You must be aware that in micropayment transactions you should carry out zero confirmations in most cases, because the customer who pays for an ice cream cannot wait for the ice cream to melt to confirm payment. So the BTC becomes  extremely risky to use in commercial stores!  I repeat anyone can make this attack!  Using BTC in micropayment stores and trades is extremely risky!
@_date: 2019-12-11 18:27:10
Not quite, as investors only think about the future of bitcoin, no one realized that bitcoin is not viable for micropayments!  everyone is expecting LN!  But it is now extremely risky to use bitcoin to trade even more in countries with high criminal rates!

Is this an irony?  or would it be my bad english?  What did you not understand?
@_date: 2019-12-11 19:38:25
Truth! And this is spoken in the video! But BTC wallets already announce receipt with zero confirmations! The store seller delivers the product before confirmation, as the BTC network may take hours depending on the rates that were used! And the coins are already shown in your wallet.
That is, There is a dilemma between waiting too long and risking losing the client or risking a double pseudo attack. Which makes money unviable for micropayments and day-to-day business transactions.

Micropayments is the market that should be snapping up for cryptocurrencies!  The value of cryptocurrencies in Exchanges is not sustainable, it is just speculation!  VISA today with its micropayments has a market cap of 404 billion, while if we add the full market cap of cryptocurrencies it is not half that now!
