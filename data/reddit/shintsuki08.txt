Wait, you haven't made any argument that it actually has \*intrinsic\* value.
The definition of intrinsic value is often given as the value if there was no market for the good.  I like to think in terms of bonds because they are an easy example - if you can't turn around and sell a bond tomorrow.  You can still wait around and collect the interest.  That's the intrinsic value.  Commodities have intrinsic value too, but only to producers that use them as inputs.  Remember you can't turn and sell them, but you can make something with it and then sell that.  But that's a bit harder to follow along with.
You can choose a different definition of intrinsic value - but I have yet to come up with any except the most stretched version that would give Bitcoin intrinsic value.  (as an aside the stretched version it has intrinsic value only as a curiosity / historical artifact)
Bitcoin as a payment media or store of value media has no intrinsic value according the definition above.   It only has value when one can turn around and sell it again.  But just because it doesn't have intrinsic value, does not mean it has no value.
So I agree with you that bitcoin has value, but I would say it has extrinsic value not intrinsic.

This article is a surface level history but the events are even more intriguing if you dig deeper, and likely don't support the conclusion of a sale being made.
So the article points out a bitcointalk post by a user named Sabunir.  They made a post on Jan 24, 2010 offering a custom desktop background for 500 btc with claimed worth about $1.  There is no interest and they eventually bump it on Feb 9th because there is no interest.  But before the bump the thread Sabinur expresses the desire for payees to be able to send a short message with a payment, such as where to send the product.  Main developers sirius and (the OG) satoshi both chime in with comments on the pros/cons/limitations on including messages with transactions, a feature they've considered before but had dismissed.  Spoiler alert:  sending messages is eventually added.
Now the article finds a 500 btc transaction on Feb 24, 2010 and concludes that someone bought the desktop background without posting to the thread.  But I think it is much more likely the 500 btc is a donation from a different thread that was active on Feb 24.  Sirius had asked for a new banner that said "we accept bitcoin" in early Feb.  Sabinur posted his rendition on Feb 24 and it was favorably received and he posted the same BTC address as the sales ad for donations.  What's really interesting is this design work in late Feb 2010 is around the same time the modern Bitcoin logo of a hatched B inside a coin came out of a crucible of discussion.  Sabinur was right in the thick of it!

The potential for intrinsic value does not require it.  And indeed due to external events something can go from valuable to worthless.
But, yes, in general the concept of intrinsic value is needlessly narrow.  I didn't come up with the idea of intrinsic value  OP just put it in the title when it didn't make sense.

A majority of hashrates may have signaled, but BTC kept the larger hashrate when the chainsplit actually happened.
A big piece of bitcoin's security comes from being the biggest SHA-256 network around.  If the hash power to 51% attach exists on another network that hangs a shadow over the network - even if it isn't economically worthwhile for the block it may be economically worthwhile to lower confidence in the weaker network.
Now of course miners are just one stakeholder - the value of mining is directly related to the price willing to be paid by users.  We need to have users, miners, and developers in the BTC community!

1. USD is legal tender for all debts.  So if you have a debt then you can settle it in USD.  Creating a debt is a surprisingly common situation for instance at a restaurant where you eat first then pay.  After eating you have a debt to the restaraut.
2. USD is required to pay the IRS.
These two things ensure a broad demand for USD fiat beyond its convenience to everyday life.  The only other exclusive  use of usd I know of is for the purchase of US Govt treasuries (USD denominated bonds) at the initial auction.

**Paypal is actually a pretty good solution to send money** almost always, because they have set up their policies to favor the 'buyer.'  Your credit card or other financial details that could be stolen are not transmitted to third parties.  And the transaction fee is, all things considered, reasonable.
**Paypal is also a pretty good solution to receive money** **when you trust the other party**.  A transaction is 'confirmed' almost instantly.  Though Paypal *may* hold back a large portion of the funds for sixty plus days in order to be able to claw them back for their buyer friendly policies.
**Paypal is a poor solution to receive money if you don't trust the other party.**  Such as when selling on ebay.  'Buyer protection' which is so appealing to the other side of the exchange could also be written as 'forced refunds'.  Paypal's policies enable several flavors of scam where unscrupulous buyers end up with their money and the seller's item such as the ol' returning an empty box scam!
Bitcoin is like digital cash, once it has changed hands there is no third party company that can claw it back.

The potential for intrinsic value does not require a market for fiat.  That happens to be true for (most) bonds.  But it's not a general property of intrinsic value.   The intrinsic value concept would work in a bartering economy as well.  In that case it's the value you can use something for other than directly trading it.

There are two potential reasons.
The first, and most likely, is as an anti-money laundering measure.  Money laundering is a tool of organized crime and I surely won't argue that making it difficult for them to move ill-gotten money around is of positive benefit to society.  The argument would be whether it is worth the cost in decreased individual liberty and privacy.  ... For instance one may just want to conceal that they've turned their basement into a gold laiden den fit for Smaug from would be robbers but then coke-money gets to hide too.
The second reason would be as a prelude to restricting private gold ownership (especially as a piece of a negative interest rate policy).  But I think this reason unlikely.

Communication through language is about shared definitions.  You can hope everyone shares that definition.  It's clear to me just from this thread that several other definitions for store of value are also used.
But you know your quoted definition just restated the two variations I gave above.  It has two separate definitions and the second one (more generally) is the one that can be backtested to establish 'truth' at historical points in time.  In terms of retaining purchasing power we can just backtest against today's price.  How many days could you have bought bitcoin and be down more than 20% in 2019 dollars?  It's a small number, about 90 and all within the past year.  Use a holding time horizon of greater than a year and store of value for bitcoin starts to look better than USD which is constantly inflating.  Now many people consider stock index funds better stores of value then USD for long time horizon savings but those have down years and volatility so that starts to hit at exactly what you mean when you use the first definition that just says a store of value must be predictably useful. If stocks can be good stores of value at least some uncertainty in usefulness must be allowed.  Which is all simply to say I don't find your conclusion that bitcoin is a poor store of value very obvious at all.
@_date: 2019-11-07 01:55:08
Is that a claim made in this paper?  Or do I need to wait 4.5 years to find out?
This convergence parameter is basically fit off of just two boom-bust cycles.  I expect many alternative models would fit the data equally well.  And this particular formulation and fit results in a future point where the limits are disjoint in time - the lower bound suddenly relocates to above the prior upper bound in 2028.  I'd say that behavior would lead me to reject this model in favor of something else.
I don't want to sound too negative as it's worthwhile to discuss these sorts of things.  But it seems I remain either confused or unconvinced on your arguments
@_date: 2019-11-12 12:34:08
This just highlights the important of definitions.  If you define store of value as low volatility then bitcoin is a poor store of value.  If you define it as low chance of negative returns the historical prices for bitcoin suggest it is a good store of value.  Yet that definition is really about the collective future projections of value so if your own view is other people won't value it in the future then it is again a poor store of value.  Money is a social construct.  
What is a good store of value today is subjective.  What has been a good store of value in the past is objective.  Bitcoin in the past has been a good store of value.  Not the best over all timelines, but a good one nonetheless.
@_date: 2019-11-12 12:15:04
This analysis neglects the flow of bitcoin from those selling from their stockpile.  That unaccounted for flow makes it hard to jump from $15 M net to $1 M net as a conservative number.  There's many factors that are unknown and that certainly adds to the challenge for anyone who tries to forecast long term price.

The only thing to be said is that the supply and demand shifted.
But you could ask was it a supply or demand shock?  In the supply shock case it could either be miners who generate new coins selling less or those that own bitcoin selling less (for the same price).   Or of course both.  In the demand shock case it  could be current owners demanding more (at a given price) or it could be new entrants demanding more.  Or, again, it could be both or some combination of the four cases.
I think those four cases given a good framework to build a working theory.  But while you can spin a story to explain any of the four, **it's basically impossible to hypothesize based on data** on which of the four cases were recently active without access to data from large exchanges that isn't made public.  And in some cases even that wouldn't help as the activity may be sparked from private deals where the exchanges only see the second or third part effects.
Probably worth more of your thought is what happens when a large but expected supply shock, the mining reward halving, comes next year.

I think perhaps the more interesting aspect to that question is that you can't rule it out.  There's almost no good argument for why bitcoin's price and value could not be 250 k.  
The value proposition to users is basically here is a cryptographic thing that you can own.  It is scarce, uncopyable, and assignable to someone else over a communication network.  What's that worth?  I don't know it's never existed before.
The security of bitcoin continues to improve.  Mining hardware advances, continued mining capital investment, and continued software development all point to the continued increase in the security of the system which is an important source of value to users.  Large financial institutions are becoming more involved and should be incentivized to invest in initiatives like blockstream mining that help decentralized the hash power.  And the measuring stick will continue to inflate insuring that if bitcoin survives long enough it must almost inevitably be worth 250k USD.  Which brings me back to why I said almost.  Bitcoin is not currently priced at 250k.  It must continue to exist for an unknown length of time to get there.  Is that 5 years? 50 years?  No one knows.  The social construct that surrounds bitcoin did pretty well with the bitcoin vs bitcoin cash crisis.  For instance two potential and known catalysts which could could precipitate a crisis - Satoshi dumping her holdings or the sha256 algorithm becoming cryptographically compromised.

Chirpy about?  I'm not that poster, but let's not make a mountain out of a bump in the road.  There's a lot to be chirpy about.  Bitcoin is gaining in dominance over alts.  Bitcoin is trading at 3x its recent lows.  Bitcoin has proven that despite its large scale now it still can rapidly dislocate the price - a pattern that's been responsible for a large fraction of its historical price appreciation.  What are you freaking out about?  A 20% drop on an over extended price.

You want some rando on the internet to convince you to put half your life savings into a risky altcoin?  That's gambling not investing.
Take a look at this mod post, it's good advice.  
Bitcoin is structured to become rarer over time.  Is this alt?  Bitcoin is secured by the worldest largest collection of computing power and it's code has been reviewed by the most number of eyes.  Is this alt secure in a similar way?  For instance ETH is pretty neat technology but it's not structured the same way as bitcoin to increase in value.  Furthermore LINK is the offering of a business how do they make money and is it aligned with appreciating the value of their token?  
To avoid being swindled you really need to come up with your own investing thesis then ask for feedback on that.  And for something as risky as even just vanilla bitcoin don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

Leases are more than the monthly payment my amigo. X down plus Y per month for Z months for A miles with option (or no option for teslas) to purchase for B.  Need all those factors before you can compare a lease.
You can rent a lambo for $330 if you put enough down.  Luxury brands like BMW tend to target the $300ish per month lease payment, but it's usually by frontloading the deal with a big down payment.  The depreciation on a 2 series or other BMW model is huge compared to a civics, and you have to pay for that one way or another.

Something to ponder regarding 


Why are we artificially limiting the total number of bitcoin to 21M?  It's a surprisingly similar question.
Most changes have a natural tension between users / miners / and holders so to ensure long term success of bitcoin I think it's very important to only enact changes that have overwhelming support from all three groups, changes that are recognized as being in the long term interest of the whole network.

A very interesting read that is well supported by analysis.  The comparison to stock-to-flow is my favorite part as that was a model proposed with surprisingly good fit to the data.  Though I have two points that are't considered.  
1)  Stock-to-flow (S2F) considers the outstanding bitcoin amount (and its growth from 0 to 18M) better than a pure price model like you propose.  The logical argument that a marginal dollar will have less effect with a higher price would be stronger if based on market cap not the price of one coin.
2)  The S2F model you compare against is probably not the best to use, a two part model is a better long term model to compare against.  The 10x trend is just the rate predicted until it intersects the *dimishing* "precious metals trendline" so periods 5 and on would be lower and I suspect closer to your model. See 
 
@_date: 2019-12-24 00:19:08
In terms of the definition I think you are putting too onerous of a test on 'predictably useful.'  Gold's exchange rate to USD fluctuates in a wide band and it is considered among the best stores of value.  A good need not have constant nor perfectly predictable future value to be a good store of value.

A ponzi scheme is a fraud.  Early backers are paid out with late backers money who are then left with nothing.  Because whatever the moneymaking claim was (ie "investments" in timberland) it never existed or never generated anywhere close to the revenue claimed.  So one was lied to as part of the ponzi scheme - that's the fraud and that's why you want to avoid ponzi schemes.
In comparison bitcoin is a speculative investment.  No one is lying about its capabilities (decentralized, secure digital asset) but there are a great many factors that will affect its future price and one could reasonably predict it could end up massively down or up.  If it goes massively down, like a ponzi scheme, you could be left holding the bag.  But unlike the ponzi scheme there are reasonable cases where you gain massively.  So the bitcoin price unlike a ponzi scheme is a fair (or at least market based) pricing of risk vs. reward.
One way to frame the potential of bitcoin to your friend is through a thought experiment.  Propose a centralized asset with similar properties.  Ie ECB decides to release "saving coins" to help people save relative to inflation. They have fixed release schedule over a number of years and then stop at 21 M.  You can transfer them over the internet for a small fee within 1 hr.   Would your friend want some?   Your friend might argue that these properties are impossible or don't make sense and that's the risk side.  The reward side is if Bitcoin can continue to keep them true.
