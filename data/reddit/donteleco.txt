In fact, I'm not worried about this figures. I bought a month ago 200gh/s, and even if I receive my units in November, I still can recover my investment in just over a month.

Yes, they deleted my thread. It seems that Lab_rat forum moderator didn't like my calculations. Here you have the reason for deletion (and my reply):
*[QUOTE=Lab_Rat]Hello *****,
*I'm a moderator on the forum, I apologize for having to delete your thread, but people come on this forum and expect accurate information, so posts like this will falsely discourage future customers.*
*Please check your numbers and if you come up with a number that isn't quite so outrageous the post will be allowed as a speculation and discussion thread.*
**And my reply:**
*I'm really sorry to hear about that, because I think that I clearly said that in the post that all figures were rough estimations and everybody was welcomed to correct them. In any moment I tried to fool anybody.*
*I also can't understand how the deleted thread can discourage anybody. If you check future earnings with my figures, even with 46M difficulty, a jalapeño will pay for itself in 52 days. That's a good dam investment in any market.*
*I'm very disappointed with your decision, but happy to know that you think that number outrageous, as that means that you have far less orders than I estimated, and also my 200 GH/s order will be delivered sooner than expected.*
*I will keep an eye on the forums so this time I can correctly estimate the production rate and the total orders. Maybe I can post a reliable figure in about two weeks.*

So you are giving away 0.3usd. I guess you didn't have enough budget for a 200 USD Google AdWords campaign

Well done. That way my order will arrive sooner

Based on analysis of bfl.ptz.ro table. I considered past non delivered orders as canceled. Also based on what Judy from bfl said in forums, considering that they fulfilled June orders in 5 days. Thread in bfl forums has been delete, arguing that I could discourage new customers with a crazy figure. I think it gives my guess more accuracy that I though it had. You can find calculations at
