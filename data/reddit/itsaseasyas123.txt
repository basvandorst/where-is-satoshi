it's perfectly sane to make the decision to cash out enough to cover yourself from any losses on your initial investment. so that's what I did. still pretty happy with the decision. just wish I had cashed out that amount back when it was peaking.

Startups are very busy companies and often one of the hardest things to decide is which good ideas you should invest the time to work on. In this case, IF they think they want to go this route, they should do some simple A/B testing to see if it helps with new users buying. It would be a mistake to just assume it will help and just make the switch.

You've got to love civil threads like this one. A lot of the comments are coming from users trying out the new app and finding bugs along the way. At the same time, the guys from Coinbase are grabbing all the feedback they can get and even tipping people for their feedback. 
I'd wager that there aren't many other product-release situations like this where level heads prevail on both sides and everyone seems to be supportive. Nowadays people are just looking for reasons to bitch about things that don't work. Good stuff Bitcoin.

I'd imagine they'd be pretty flexible but the market is pretty crazy right now so maybe they'll wait for calmer seas. /speculation/

it probably wasn't an intentional choice. probably just some machine learning

If we ignore the aspect of Bitcoin as a currency, is there anything preventing it from being a great store of wealth in the coming years? As a deflationary currency, wouldn't it be a great way to ensure the money you save now is worth as least as much down the road? Inflation is always a threat with just about every other currency. Of course, all of this is assuming Bitcoin doesn't crash and burn (which I really don't believe it will)
