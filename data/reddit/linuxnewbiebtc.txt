Buying Bitcoin in the UK can be a little challenging, though it has got a lot easier the last few years.
If this leads to every Bookies becoming a BTC exchange ( with reasonable exchange rates ) then it will be a huge leap forward for all of us in the UK.

Try using Electrum.
Select restore wallet, and then paste in your private key.
Worth a try !

I'm a little confused here.
Perhaps you would like to explain what positive aspects your response brings to this post that couldn't have been sent as a PM.
@_date: 2016-08-30 18:16:02
If the wallet is made up from lost of small transactions, then your fee probably is no where near what it needs to be.
Rather than manually setting the fee, you should look to using a wallet that calculates the fee for you based on the transaction size.
Electrum will do that for you.
p.s. as others have mentioned, if you point us to the url for this transaction on blockchain.info then we could see the bigger picture and give you a more accurate response.

Download and start playing on the casino game "Dragons Tale".
As a new player, the exisiting Mentor Grade ( Level 5 &amp; above ) players will have free "Mineral Waters" gifts for you.
These will give you anything from a few Ksats ( multiples of 0.00001 BTC ) up to several BTM's ( multiples of 0.001 btc )
Also, the game owner has just announced he is running a month of mini free-roll tournaments starting this weekend.
If you participate in these then I'm sure you will get your 9 BTM in next to no time; certainly far quicker than using Faucets !
You can withdraw at any time, but withdraw sum must be in multiples of 1 BTM ( multiples of 0.001 BTC ) and game owner usually pays generous fees on send so they confirm very quickly.
I am not affiliated with this game in any way, but I do play it and am level 5, so if you join up after reading this, please choose player "Chunk" as your mentor; that way I get a small rake-back on any games you play.
You never know, you may win BIG.
( The biggest Jackpot message I saw in this game was about 1 1/2 years ago, when one player won 124+ BTC. This player then played Many BTC's of party games where other players won from his bets ! )

BTC is so easy to work with, that so many computer noobs set up exchanges of their own, then suddenly found themselves the target of some of the cleverest hackers out there.
Many of these exchanges would have been insignificantly small in the grand scale of things, or, like Gox, got too big too soon.
The failures of many of these would have been inevitable.
In a way though we should be greatful.
This is the Bitcoin equivalent of "survival of the fittest".
It is better they fail in BTC's early days, than in a few years when it gets really big. 
If nothing else, they have brought a lot of publicity to BTC, as the &lt;cough&gt; News &lt;cough&gt; of these is pure click-bait for the plethora of wannabe websites out there that feed on bad publicity articles.
Note: As a judgement of how reputable an article is, I look to see if they have a readers comments facility. If they don't then you can usually be sure they content is drivel that would be taken apart by the readers if they could respond.
That's my $0.02 ( and rant over ! )

I used to use Multibit, but have now upgraded to Electrum.
Multibit takes 20 to 30 minutes to sync with the blockchain when you import your cold storage wallets, but with electrum you can be up and running in only a few minutes.

By the time you account for the wages ( and on-top costs ) for a team of maybe 1/2 dozen persons &amp; pay the rent on office space and equipment, you would easily  use up half of that in under a year.
The rest wont last long long when it is paid to the lawyers &amp; other legal experts they would need to liase with on a regular basis.
@_date: 2016-08-31 08:32:11
Sigh !
Let me explain it to you in simpler terms.
Survival of the fittest means only the exchanges that give the secure &amp; professional service that customers need will survive in the long run.
As for the fat lady sings, this means that whilst BFX is currently still operating, the saga isn't over yet. 
i.e. they either need to do something miraculous to recover from the hack, or dwindle away to become one of the 33%.

I love reading the anti-bitcoin comments readers leave after these click-bait articles, spouting off the same nonsense about beanie babies, tulips, south sea bubble, "I've invented a coin selling for $20k each buy now..." and thinking they're ever so clever, when to anyone with even a childs knowledge of bitcoin see them as ignorant fools. 
Call me sick minded, but I get this warm glow inside by just knowing they got left behind in the past and will continue to get left behind in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:14:08
Maybe the often promised ( but still not happening ) solutions like Lightening may eventually come along, but surely, even the slowest thinking individuals must see this is yet another sign that Bitcoin no longer works as a currency for people that actually want to use it and not just HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:36:35
Been 'into' Bitcoin for a few years, and clearly remember when it was a usable currency and the future of Internet commerce and micro-transactions.
Nowadays its useless unless you want to pay to move huge quantities of money and don't mind paying over the top for it.
What incentive if there for Noobs to buy in ? It'll cost you $25 to move it to your personal wallet, than another $25 each time you make a purchase !!!! 
Sorry if this hurts, but at the moment BCH is Bitcoin 2.0 and makes BTC look like a rather lame Alpha release.
If BTC gets unsurped by BCH its Game Over, and It'll never get back dominance.
Only today a work colleague was asking me about investing in BTC and I advised against it, part due to it currently being a bit overpriced ( $10k is a fair price ) and I expect a 40 to 50% correction ( but it may hit $50 or $60K before this !!! ), but mostly  due to the fees &amp; TX time problems.
These unrealistic confirm times and fees need to end immediately.
p.s. if you read my other posts you will see I play a Game called Dragons Tale; this is a BTC MMO casino game, and I have made Hundreds of BTC transactions in and out of the game over the last few years, and would confidently say I have sent BTC more times than most posters in this sub-reddit.
edit: Just checked my DT deposit address, and have made well over 1000 deposits totaling nearly 20 BTC! ( Fortunately most of these were when BTC was cheap, and I made quite a few withdraws as well, so it wasn't all losses, but... Dang !!! an extra 20 BTC at todays prices sure would be nice ).

Lol dude.
All the Bitcoin Cash &amp; have was free from when it split from Bitcoin Alpha.
I have more interest than you in seeing one of the Bitcoins succeed, and would probably be correct in saying I have more $$$ worth of Bitcoin Gold from that split, than you even have in Bitcoin Alpha.
Come back when you're at least a member of the whole coin club and it actually matters to you if Bitcoin has a future, and then try telling people Bitcoin Alpha is a success when you can't spend it anywhere.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:44:37

I first heard of Bitcoin ( when they were selling for about $1.20 ) they were briefly mentioned in an online article about Wikileaks, and my thoughts were about as educated as those seen in the commenting on that article.
I read about them again a couple of years later in an online forum when they were around $15 to $20 each.
I'm happy to say that not choosing to be an ignorant fool, I read up a little about them.
.... and then came the lightbulb moment.
This last 5 years has been a fun rollercoaster ride !

. . . and they don't half have some tantrums if you point out some facts about Bcash.
Take a look at some of my posts in r/btc and see how upset they get.
One loser ( about a month ago ) said " I hope you lose it all " when I spoke about Bitcoin v's Bcash.
Bcash was worth about 0.1 Bitcoin then, and has since dropped under 0.07 Bitcoin and falling at a constant rate.
Talk about Karma biting you on the ass !!!!!!

No FUD needed mate. 
When it costs you $50 to get a confirm in a reasonable time then its game over. 
Seriously dude, you think $0.50 is a reasonable fee ?, and would you like to tell us, how many weeks did it take to get your first confirm paying this ?
&lt;cough&gt; Noob &lt;cough&gt;
Its been years since I spent $0.50 for a fast transaction, and then it was made up of a lot of seperate inputs. 
It's time for Bitcoin Alpha ( Btc ) to either sort its act out, or move aside and let a real contender like Bitcoin 2.0 ( Bch ) take over.
@_date: 2017-02-20 20:51:37
Note: whenever I get a bunch of small amounts in my hot wallet ( 10 to 30 btm's ) I send to a new address with the 0.101 fee. sure it takes a few days to clear ( took 4 days once when we had a huge backlog a few weeks ago ) but when you want a payment to clear fast, paying a higher mBTC/kB isn't so expensive as your transaction size will be far smaller.
Also I think its a good thing to push through TX's with lower fees.
Paying the "higher fees" game is only playing into the hands of greedy miners holding back BTC adoption by resisting block size increases / seg witness etc...
@_date: 2017-02-20 20:59:57
Submitted it to the ViaBTC accelerator for you. Should confirm next time they mine a block !
If you want fast confirms you need a fee quite a bit higher than that, but if you're prepared to wait a while that fee is plenty.
@_date: 2017-02-20 20:46:58
Use Electrum. Create a new wallet and import all your private keys. set your tx fees to 0.101 mBTC/kB. send a bunch of transactions that each group half a dozen or more dust ammounts to a new address. submit transactions to ViaBTC transaction accelerator. wait a day or two until confirmed. repeat until balance is in a single address. sure you will pay a fair % in fees, but you are cashing in the equivalent of a large bag of loose change, and remember that coinstar change machine in your local supermarket takes 7 or 5 % in fees, so you can't complain about the same thing with BTC. Other option is to wait a few years until BTC is significantly higher and fees significantly lower then spend those ksats that will then be worth something !

Quick and easy with no hoops to jump through, and a better exchange rate when buying than nearly all the other UK exchanges.
With the fast UK bank transfer, the whole deal literally takes a minute from 1st logging on to Bitbargain and sending the coins to your wallet ( or person you want to pay ).
Don't forget to buy a few $ / £ / EU etc... more than you need each time and HODL the change !

I'm pro-bitcoin, but I think this is well funny !
Too many players only bought in when when the bubble came along, and it is these same players that filled their pants and sold magnifying the correction.
I know it can be hard to be patient, but a long term sideways graph with slow growth is the way we want to go, and that is where we are heading again ( until the next bubble ).
p.s. these is also a posting of this on the fake bitcoin sub. Managed to get myself a -5 ratings in a few minutes by pointing out a little inconvenient truth to them. i.e. Bcash/Bitcoin just hit a 1 year low, and the all time low won't be far behind !

Bitcoin core ( as a coin ) doesn't exist. It's just a name only ever used by scammers and Bcash shills, mostly only on the r/btc sub-reddit ( and on a certain website used for pumping Bcash ) to try and confuse new users into buying their alt-coin Bcash instead of Bitcoin ( BTC ).
@_date: 2016-11-05 20:39:01
I bought my first BTC about 6 months before the Gox collapse, and I can verify what btcchef said, as even then there were loads of warnings on the BTC forums to not use them. 
Most of the warnings were saying there were unreasonably long waits to withdraw BTC, suggesting Gox didn't have the BTC that they were selling.
With the number of warnings I read, I can't understand why anyone was still dealing with them when they went down.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:42:33
Its just a shame that transactions cost $20 to $30.
Bitcoin has lost its way and will never be mainstream for everyday transactions until costs to send BTC get back to where they were a few years ago.
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:48:56
BTC used to have the promise of being the one universal currency along the likes of Star Trek universal credits, with dirt cheap, or even free transaction costs. Nowadays fee's are so high its like a slightly less expensive version of Western Union.
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:46:53
Just look on Blockchain and see the fees needed to put your transaction in the middle of a block. You noobs might think these are acceptable, but to us old time BTCers this is crazy. BTC is getting more expensive than Paypal for purchase transactions, but with Paypal you can at least send to friends for free, but you will not have any protection.... a bit like when you use BTC for payments. If BTC wants to be a long term success then it needs to look at what made it a success in the early days. Geez dude, BTC has lost its way so much I'm actually saying positive things about Paypal !!!
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:23:11
Finally, someone posts a Gif showing the BTC transaction costs in $ terms.
We need to get back to the fees of only a few years ago when 10 cents fee was enough to get you a confirm in the next block.
If we can do that them maybe we'll see mainstream adoption, and businesses will start taking BTC as a means of payment, instead of stopping taking it like they have recently.
Lets bring back that magic internet money thing !
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:41:50
So you found the cheapest transaction on one of the blocks that took over 7 hours for the 1st confirm and make this claim !. Grats dude, but it's time to get Real. TX costs are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYY to high to take BTC seriously as a mainstream currency.
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:32:43
No, just a very large HODLer who's being realistic. If BTC can't sort out the fees problem, it will never be the universal currency it was touted as during its early years, and that's why I'll be HODLing my BCH until the market decided which one will be the winner.

The fact you asked this, tells us you are more or less convinced this is the way to go.
Consider the advantages and dis-advantages:
If you don't, then there are no advantages, but...
If you do, there are no real disadvantages other than people may not use it, and you incur a negligible setup cost &amp; time, but if you only get one new additional sale from the viral advertising this will create, then it will prove to be a worthy idea.

I have read a lot about Bitcoin,  and my conclusion is that it was never intended for use in bricks &amp; mortar stores, but instead was meant to be an internet cash system for online payments etc... without the problems associated with the traditional systems.
i.e. the money equivalent of email.
The fact that there are B&amp;M stores that accept Bitcoin only show how remarkable it is.

If they are hoping to rebuild a reputation and stay in the market, then they need to spend every satoshi of profits on buying all this dept back ASAP.
If they do this quick enough their reputation would go through the roof, and they could be in a better position than they were before the incident.
@_date: 2016-09-17 11:59:46
Using google, you can easily find several websites that you can use to create a receive/spend bitcoin pair, but...
Nowadays people tend to use Electrum Seeds instead of paper wallets.
Download &amp; Install Electrum, and when you create a new wallet it will give you a bunch of seed words.
Note these somewhere safe.
Any time you choose to restore an electrum wallet with these seed words, you will have the exact same list of receive / spend addresses.
Give it a go, and see how easy and friendly it is to use.
If you are ultra paranoid, you can even create a " Tails " disk &amp; use this. Tails is a stand alone bootable Linux operating system that also has the electrum program as part of its package. Using this you can generate the receive addresses on a system that has never connected to the internet.
Hope this helps !
@_date: 2016-09-02 17:39:37
If they pay everyone back, maybe even throw in a bonus for inconvenience, they can market themselves as the exchange that makes good, even after huge losses.
In time people will forget the short term inconveniences, and will only remember that they made good afterwards.
@_date: 2016-09-16 21:14:40
Please Note:
I first got into Bitcoin about many months before the collapse of Gox, and I read on the various forums that people were even then advising people to avoid them, stating very long delays getting your bitcoin or cash from them.

Hi mbroch, 
not trying to insult your knowledge. Last post was for thread originator, and posted it in a position that was an installment in the ongoing conversation. 
Other posters have mentioned ways to buy, but no one went into detail on how to buy in the shady manner the thread originator wanted.
@_date: 2016-10-16 17:36:00
The only way you are going to buy bitcoin without some form of genuine ID is to pay cash in hand at a bitcoin meetup, or, find someone who will sell online taking paypal payments sent as a gift ( so t is non-reversible).
If you do this with paypal though be advised you have no protection if the seller doesn't send you the BTC.
You will most likely have to pay a premium for this service though, and will have a very high chance of getting ripped off.
Best way to do paypal to BTC is through a trusted friend. Join a BTC gambling site or popular forum and make friends with a very trusted player. After a few months when you are 100% sure of their reputation and sure they can be trusted then maybe ask them to to a BTC for paypal gift exchange. 
Then keep transactions small. 
Instead of $25 in one go, maybe buy $8 a time once a week, this way if they rip you off you haven't lot a lot of $$$.
P.S. If paypal find out you are using their service to buy a product without their fees, they will most likely block your account.
Too many people have lost a lot on money in the past from reversed CC or PP payments, hence the difficulty in turning these into BTC, especially so without ID verification. 
Once you have BTC and want to make them more anonymous, then that is another learning curve for you to deal with.

I have never advised anyone to buy Bitcoin.
My only advice is...
1) Read up on Bitcoin.
2) Read some more.
3) Repeat steps 1 &amp; 2 until you get that Light-bulb moment.
When you understand enough about Bitcoin you will realize why the price has gone the way it has, and will be convinced on how it will go in the long term.
