Has anyone visited this ATM or Embassy? Would be curious to talk with them.
@_date: 2015-12-15 18:48:17
Hi guys. I'm John. PM me if you have any questions. I'll do a fun AMA later, maybe next week before the holiday.
@_date: 2015-12-15 21:33:58
what's wrong with me?
@_date: 2015-12-15 18:45:26
I think you might be mistaking me for someone else. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 19:10:18
Maybe you meant the interview with Nate and Wences where I jokingly called it a fad. Anyway, hi!
@_date: 2015-12-15 18:45:43
Not brand new, no, but better.
@_date: 2015-12-15 21:33:40
hi guys!
@_date: 2015-12-15 22:24:28
The best thing is we can hire guys like you (but not you) to help where we need it.
@_date: 2014-01-17 00:44:48
Remember when I told you guys this was going to happen? Good times.

I literally just did a web search. It was the first one I could find that was super simple and I like how it ensures the bitcoin has landed before it releases the download.
@_date: 2015-05-14 21:56:16
actually i just added another button for paperback.

Hey. John Biggs here. While I do enjoy the snorts of derision in this thread, I would honestly like to bring a few experts onto the show. I welcome anyone to email me at john to talk about your particular interest on the show. Alex and I know enough about bitcoin to be dangerous but Alex knows quite a bit about economics and I'm a hardware guy. As for the audio quality we're limited in our podcast resources - this was a skunkworks project without a budget - but if you know an actual producer, let us know as well. Happy some of you enjoyed it.

The crazy thing is that it only took two minutes using Satoshibox.com. I'm really pleased.
@_date: 2015-01-16 13:31:10
@_date: 2015-05-07 13:14:24
That's a really nice thing to say. Thanks. I'm glad you enjoyed it.

TechCrunch in general has never been critical of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-14 21:10:36
ok buy the ebook and PM me your address.
@_date: 2014-10-07 19:00:22
Isaacson is also a crank.

There is no mention of “proof” in this post, just the concept of rewards. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 19:19:49
So should we take a dna sample?
@_date: 2019-02-08 19:16:43
We don't record your video or keep images of your face. It's all run on the client side.
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:32:44
But a lot of these folks are right about ideas being cheap....
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:32:02
I didn't see the email. send it to john
@_date: 2019-01-07 21:14:34
The client side has facial recognition and follows your eyes.

See also Bitcoin ATMs that take your handprint for KYC.

I'm the co-founder and I wanted to explain why we did this. Basically, I hate sponsored content. I'm a former editor at TechCrunch and current EIC at TheBlock and the way sponsored posts work is they try to piggyback on the goodwill associated with real content on the site and 99% of the time sponsored content is either ignored or mistaken for real content and you get pissed off.
So we asked what would it take for a win-win-win - the marketer gets GOOD eyeballs, the site gives back to its readers, and the readers get a little cash. The best solution is HypeHop.
Look: you're being surveilled. You click a link on Amazon and that garbage follows you around the Internet and creates a dossier on you. In our case we don't store your face or video, the video is entirely client side, and we use your face as confirmation you're watching and not messing around on Reddit. You can game it, sure, but it's the only way right now to confirm that. We also take emotional readings - happy, sad, angry - using client side tools. If you're going to give up your privacy, why not get paid by the marketers who want it so badly? 
If it sounds weird remember that once upon a time some dude said "Hey, wouldn't it be cool if you could rent out your basement to a stranger?" and they ignored him for years until they didn't. 
Right now it's kind of a ProductHunt that pays you to browse it but in the future we will offer embeds.

read below. It at least ensures you're paying attention. Marketers want you to pay attention to their explainers and we're incentivizing users to do it via payments.
@_date: 2019-01-07 19:19:03
We're trying to get ahead of this: 
@_date: 2019-01-07 18:50:56
Yeah, man, it really sucks when people try to offer legitimate uses for Bitcoin in the wild.
@_date: 2015-09-22 00:58:39
have you all read his book?
@_date: 2015-09-22 00:58:31
I'm the moderator, John Biggs (AMA). I love bitcoin. Popper was a little excitable about the blockchain but that was about it. 
@_date: 2016-10-04 01:56:23
This would be great if true. To avoid risk you'd have to buy and sell BTC instantly and then pull it into your bank account just as quickly. You can't. The problem is plumbing. The pipes between may be fast as lightning but the plumbing in the banks - fiat in and out - is slow and cheap or fast and expensive. The resulting savings are cancelled out most times, rarely do you make money, sometimes you lose money. Scale this process up and you don't have enough btc in India to support all the transactions or suddenly there's a trade imbalance flowing from rich to poor countries and you end up putting gold bullion in a bag and flying it to JFK to top up your reserves. Bitcoin remittance is fun to imagine but currently impossible in practice.

Not going to say that's a "good" example of what CBS news did but I'm the dude who was talking about Silk Road during that section and it's really hard to explain cyptocurrencies to a morning audience. I had to rephrase things multiple times before they thought it made sense. Bitcoin is hard!
