Ok thanks guys. I wasn't aware that it hasn't been tested thoroughly enough yet. I thought it might be as easy as.....buy "this" computer, run "this" OS and "this" software, then leave it on for 24hrs.

Wow, good call. He totally does.

In my own personal experience, it's to complicated for about 95% of people I talk to.

I live in Italy and it was a pain in the ass getting my Coinbase account opened last year. (*disclaimer* I do NOT support Coinbase because they've done some less credible stuff lately) Unfortunately, I don't think you'll be able to if you don't have a US bank account to tie your account to. Also, when taking pictures of my ID, Coinbase wouldn't accept pictures taken on my phone. The pictures needed to be taken with my laptop camera and submitted for whatever reason. Basically it's a pain in the ass but it's not illegal. Easiest thing to do is, have a German friend in the crypto scene just send some to you and give him Euros. That's what I find easiest and I don't have to waste time with Shitbase.

In my opinion, it's some pump n' dump, some consolidation and some weak hands scared about US regulation with all the fuss Congress has been making about Libra in the last week.

Isn't Bitcoin the 7th largest currency in the world (or something close to that)?
@_date: 2019-10-24 04:15:14
Bitcoin is a threat to the money he pockets from his donors. Human garbage.

He's an oligarch in the current system. He probably doesn't want that to change.
@_date: 2019-12-26 20:10:15
 Yang is the only candidate who's outspokenly pro cryptocurrency and that would be huge for Bitcoin if he manages to win in my opinion.

Mnuchin is so nefarious he looks like he's transforming into Nosferatu.

I love the Proof of Keys idea but if people take their BTC off the exchanges in mass, won't that crash the price?

He's 74 and still partying like a rock star. I'm so happy that people like John are around and in the public eye. I don't know about that prediction though.
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:48:54
I'll continue farting all day to see if the price keeps climbing.

I bought about 2hrs ago and BTC immediately went down $800. It never fails LOL.

My buddy finally got into crypto and accidentally bought BCash on Coinbase yesterday when he meant to buy Bitcoin. It pissed me off when he told me that.

After months of research, I still can't figure out how the Future's markets work. What exactly does it mean if the Long is at $30K. Is that a positive or negative? Thanks.

People complain about it's premium but it made me a ton of money last year so I'm a fan.

Yang is the only candidate who has been outspoken in favor of crypto. I'm not a Dem (or Rep) but for that reason he's got my support.
@_date: 2019-09-10 08:45:03
I don't think it'll end GBTC. I think if money floods into a BTC ETF and the BTC price shoots up, so does GBTC. The premium GBTC has on it's trust might go down (maybe?) but I think a BTC ETF is awesome for GBTC.

Andreas on JRE in 2014 is what got me into Bitcoin. It changed my life in ways I never thought possible. I can't thank those dudes enough.

Is there still a dude in Japan with like 150,000 Mt Gox bitcoins that might dump them at anytime? I remember he dumped some a couple years ago causing a crash but then his lawyer said he won't do that anymore or something like that. Does anyone know if that's still a thing?
