So much for decentralized...

I used "heart beat" in quotes to simplify things. My argument still stands for heart rate, rhythm, sinus arrhythmia, and even axis, but you can't measure axis with only a single lead, as with this device. 
It's an all-around flawed security hypothesis.

Agreed! Now, consider the alternatives. For example, I have a Reddcoin node running on a cheapo AllWinnerA10 dev board that consumes 5W of electricity... less that a compact fluorescent bulb. The comparison really shows the waste of resources that is Bitcoin. These mining groups are dumping buckets of cash and consuming massive amounts of electricity doing the exact same thing that I can do with Reddcoin, using a $25 1Ghz single-core ARM processor. When the barrier of entry is $25 and negligible maintenance cost, then you can start considering a truly decentralized network.

Yeah! I saw it coming before you posted! 
Congrats! We both have a cool story now!

I did. You missed it.
Received in the Gulf, and
Sent from the Gulf.

You just described online record keeping. PayPal, CC, bank, etc. is just accessing your acct. on their server to instruct them to send money to my acct. on their server. 
The bitcoin sent to me in the Gulf was an actual digital property that exists only on my device, and nowhere else. Basically, this person handed me cash from some unknown location in the world while I was floating on a boat.

In your case, a bank (a land-based establishment) still ultimately controls that money. 
I am holding the only device in the world with the private key for the received amount. I am the only person in the world who can control it.

Yup. I started mining on a CPU a few years ago! I got more BTC/day with a CPU than I'm getting today with a 50Gh/s ASIC. I am paying more in electricity than I am mining BTC. I considered selling my ASIC a few weeks ago, but I realized it is essentially worthless. So, I am just running it until it fries itself. 
The single computer nerd miners are no longer players in the network. Bitcoin has become a few large players. 
Altcoins are the only thing left for us tinkerers... I got into reddcoin because I can go back to the days of having a CPU take care of everything. I can't even compete with the altcoins that use GPU mining, bc all of the old bitcoin miners with big rigs dominate that arena.

SWAT raid wasn't necessary because the company was run by white dudes. That's how things work, right?

Whoo! Someone just sent me 2mBTC! 
Truly mobile payment!
Here's a pic of the nearest bank:

TL;DR - Your heart beat is a terrible way to secure your Bitcoin wealth.
Doc here... Not really sure how this could possibly work well. An individual's "heart beat" changes multiple times per minute in response to multiple physiological and environmental changes, like something as simple as breathing. This would require a large margin of error in a security algorithm that uses  heart beat parameters as a key. With a large margin of error, it wouldn't take much effort to find another individual whose heart beat meets the same criteria.

Received while still in US waters. Good question though. Bitcoin boating is unprecedented.
@_date: 2014-12-27 20:21:48
I don't want to know. I plan on staying in my boat.
@_date: 2014-12-27 20:37:45
Oh... Didn't read that correctly. 
Here you go! Straight from the Gulf of Mexico!
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:45:37
What does this mean for my bitcoins?

Hey shut up you little pot-licker I'll stick you in a microwave!
@_date: 2015-04-04 02:43:45
I would like to partake. It's easy enough for me to pay, right here from my phone. The question is, how are you going to get my main course and free beer to Philadelphia, PA?
