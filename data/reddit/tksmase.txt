I think I would both lose my sort-of anonymity and give them bullets to complain about rabid Bitcoin fanboys attacking their one and true favorite product

I'll have to try Kraken, Bitstamp seems to be backlogged into infinity with their team of three special trained monkeys

Even more incentive for Twitter to do the right thing and support open source developers.
You have to remember, Twitter bans conservatives and a lot of different folks all the time for things that aren’t legally wrong. They have the right as a company to manage their service base as they wish.

Gotcha! Yeah I'm pretty hopeful for btc future myself
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:58:27
I mean dogecoin transfers near instantly and the fees are comparably non existant, it doesn’t make them a bitcoin rivalcoin
Bitcoin cash is mostly a genius marketing scheme that is perfectly designed to mislead complete newbies. “Oh the chart says it’s quick and has lower fees! Oh I can buy a full one instead of 0.3 bit coins!”
It’s dishonest and I personally wouldn’t touch it with an eight feet pole unless I was planning to pump and dump
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:18:40
Do you also plan on long term HODL?

@_date: 2018-01-09 06:44:30
Nah fuck that guy. His personality has nothing to do with the technology, reading his thoughts on pretty much everything on twitter is enough to realize he’s a walking FUD
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:12:48
Is it logical to assume that there is going an improvement (segwit/lightning) to btc system that will skyrocket the price once again? Imo current only problem of bitcoin is the transaction fee+time it takes to process it.
Also is it ok to buy small amounts of btc? Like $700 and add up more money over the year? I want to HODL into 2020
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:11:11
Yeah, right..I think this is bullshit. People care about stuff they own only because it fulfills a purpose, not so some South Park goth kids can have a superiority complex induced dialogue about it.
But of course you're free to deal in nihilistic absolutes thinking people are savages buying shiny stuff for no purpose of improving their life as they see it.

Wow that is actually super helpful, might have dodged a bullet there, I'll have to read the links in detail 3 hours later
So what if not Kraken? Gemini? What do you use for your exchange?
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:15:24
Well the value of those paintings is obviously higher than value of bitcoin
Idk what your argument even is

To be completely honest though it’s not designed with last generation in mind as first priority
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:58:40


yeah but my understanding was that hacking and siphoning are entirely different things as in, siphoning is an inside job and hacker attack is an offense campaign by a third party
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:14:31
Huh that’s a point taken
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:52:47
Yeah I was mostly saying ETH &gt; bcash any day
And i genuinely hope and believe bitcoin can overcome current difficulties
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:51:52
This smells of money, I wish I had a chance to be paid by bcash folks to promote their agenda. Then pump and dump that shit
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:54:56


I'm doing ALL of this wrong.
Kudos on being a cool head with regards to finance
@_date: 2018-01-05 06:20:04
Just a thought, aren’t you going to be fucked by transaction fees for a very small purchase? Or how does it work? Noob here
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:31:56
It might be my humble opinion based on how dumpy bcash looks like, but I’d buy ETH a hundred times before I buy bcash
I mean just taking a look at all the shilling on r btc and their face of the clone coin, eh looks more like a scam every day
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:37:40
Aight your point is completely lost on me
@_date: 2018-01-05 06:18:50
Idk why none of the high end brands do.
Ones that are always about originality like Balenciaga should pioneer this technology.
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:04:48
Hm I might give them a try, It's just that the amount of support requests and complaints gave me that image of them
Are you verified with them for a long time?

Congrats! I personally was very close to buying 2 BTC back when the prices were at ~280USD per piece and ended up flaking on the seller

Serious question: is there anything better than GDAX?
Heard a lot about Gemini on outside forums but here pretty much everyone recommended GDAX which I love using but I want to stop giving them business

Major props to you man, I couldn’t live on 20k/year alone and especially so if you include my s/o as well

Yeah it’s best if you can find a local guy for the trade and hold your stuff in a cold storage
I’d avoid big exchanges at all

Looked briefly at his account. He is discussing female and male sexuality on the internet and arguing with people about that.
That's not lying, that's being dumb as fuck for me.

That's *absolutely* not something I meant to imply with my comment above.

Loving the comments there. Making my day so far.


    "You happy now, Ukrainians?"


@_date: 2014-03-11 07:05:33
It's a task for a day, really. As some suggested Siv HD or PhantomLord are the first suggestions. Other than that it can be any popular team. TSM for example.
You can go to and see what people watch the most. Or come to twitch.tv and watch some of the most popular shitstreaming on League yourself.
I've been out of the whole League of Legends scene for a long time. A few days ago I started playing again. I haven't lost my skills (good games, score, w/l rate as back then), but I sure don't know who/what is popular amongst the community right now.

Made me want to call those guys after work.
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:40:14
Yes it is. Technically if you are able to turn most of US population into sheeps, why can't you educate people?
If not the government (no interest), then the people could help each other out and finally tell themselves not to keep all your money on a goddamn exchange.

Sorry but I fail to see the example of rage with using words "jesus, fucking, christ, god, hate, fuck" and all that. I didn't even imply I hate you people. I only said that it's pathetic to use this already-old format.
You can watch a lot more in better quality in .webm so there's completely no reason not to. This "word of the year" thing of yours was a pretty bad argument. 
"Hey it's popular so fuck the new, better solutions"

**We need it to crash down so more people can buy it.**
It's a healthy experience. Like a train stopping by to let more people in.

But I meant exactly what halfhandguy said. We're both right eh?
@_date: 2014-02-27 06:09:31
Not only the meaningless internet points make you go serious about it. But even if he is trolling (judging by his account comments) you are falling to his game.
Either way, if he is dumb, you are the dumbest next to him.
And there you go, your comment made my day. Thanks mate.

Investing $8.5k and keeping it on a stock exchange is one thing (lol dumb as fuck move), but mining bitcoins is quite another.
I have yet to hear your point on why mining bitcoins as a side task is bad or how you could lose your marriage just because of that. He's basically getting money that way.

You count the average voter based on who they voted for, while those who didn't vote are not counted.

* He is mining it at work with everybody knowing this (as he said).
* "good idea" is such a broad statement, really. I seriously don't see bitcoin falling down any soon. It's still growing and having BTC is always good.
Unless you are a goddamn retarded and you keep all your money on stock exchange just for the shits and giggles.

Elon Musk, nearest future: hey guys Tesla Motors has its production at its highest and we now have models for every kind of consumer. Why wouldn't you buy an electric, zero-emission, one hundred percent efficient vehicle that drives as fine as your typical high-end sport car?
Your logic: Sorry. We aren't that far from two hundred years since first fuel injected engines were patended and created. Your option is better, but since it's a fairly new one (a couple of years for word and a few hundred years for a mechanical evolution is fair) we won't use it.

It's a shame someone can lump up moronic arguments about all people with private lives being terrorists or child molesters and then go out to call himself a president of one of the most important countries in the world right now.
Imagine if instead of this shitty community organizer (he's ideal for a school director maybe) there was a real president who in his day and age would still be interested in learning the ever-changing currents and new technology. Because this pile of sand is outdated for new ideas and what people want today.
