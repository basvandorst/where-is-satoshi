What’s wrong with inflation?

this is one of the main reason why BTC will eventually be worth nothing. ALL currency are arbitrary, the number 1 attribute a fiat needs is stability and it's what BTC can never have.

lol never. it's going lower. eventually countries will release digital currency and the stability and amount will make people and banks switch.  BTC will slowly die, this isnt even debatable among smart people.  BTC doesent even equal a single hedge fund if you add it all up.

**Why would anyone take him seriously!!**  His entire life has been one Con-job to the next, literally.
He started out life setting ***fake magazine subscriptions*** (good scam),  then went on to faking various skills, including a brief career running a train ***illegally*** lying about his qualifications,  he then made Mcafee antivirus, which made a TON of money off the Michelangelo virus which is widely believed (I have no doubt myself) to not exist but be ***manufactured by Mcaffee himself.***   
He then took his fortune to south america to run out the clock doing drugs, but he ***killed his neighbor*** and had to come back to North America to flee authorities, now he needs a new scam and has been a ***shill for crypto.***  
**The man is a disgusting human.**
