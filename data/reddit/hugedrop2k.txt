Yeah but if the bid price is $0 then your holding won't help

No, your money is already gone when you bought. Right now the question is if you want to Con another soul out of some cash by selling.

Someone told me, that if you Open Up Your Bitcoin that you own, inside you would find your "personal number" or something.
But why do I care to find something like 3745826482 ? What does that do for me.
We have these words we've been trained to appreciate like "Wallet." Ooh, wallet!
But if you for a second omit all these words like Coin, Wallet, then what do you have left from your BTC? Some random characters.

OK So if you own a bitcoin, can you in any sense "open it" as you do a PC file, and if yes, what would you see.
And if no (you can't open it), that is even worse tbh.

I heard Bitcoin Cash is the real bitcoin.
Otherwise why would Satoshi Nakamoto get behind Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2018-12-13 03:32:53
I don't think it is "money," because nothing is being transferred (e.g. no gold coin is being transmitted through the wire).
But yes, a Perfect Password would have value, because many people enjoy dodging the government. 
So, you are telling me that Bitcoin has succeeded in hiding things from the government (tax evasion, crime) and the government is sitting on their hands about it? Not even attempting to outlaw bitcoin? Instead, putting it on Chicago Futures Exchange? 
My understanding was the opposite: The government is well capable of arresting all bitcoiners, which means the anonimity aspect was lost.

Yeah but you are burying your USD by making it Dead Money
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:40:44
It is very entertaining, whenever the money you worked your fingers to the bone for, Evaporates Forever in a swipe of the mouse.

You should liquidate some of your Bitcoin to buy cat food for later on.
Just kidding, all of your Bitcoin.

Dr. Satoshi is planning to crash bitcoin noncash, not at once but in installments

I already told you I'm extremely Rich.
You shouldn't confuse me with yourself whomst are a pleb

Yeah but all your posts are Word Salad. 
Something like this:
"You must know, in this day and age, an irrefutable placeholder for blockchain, has tremendous potential."
But actually, that can be summed up with a Fart Noise, which I'm unable to write over the computer but you can try it with your mouth

Look, you only need "so much" security. For example if you want to prevent your grandmother from opening your laptop, probably a 2-character password will do.
For a more experienced hacker, a 12 character password is better suited. Next are small countries like North Korea, they could have a lot of hacking power.
And finally the strongest breakers of passwords are countries like NATO. They are either completely impossible to circumvent; or if you can do it, then you are the government.
So, I am skeptical of your claim that bitcoin offers security unbreakable by the UN.

I saw some interview with professor Wright, and he said: "By end 2019, Bitcoin Legacy will no longer exist."
I was like Yowza and Wowza. How is this not a bigger story.
Especially since it panned out, in the sense that Legacy Bitcoin went from 6400 to 3400 in a month

Don't you see that Russian propagandists like Max Keiser are into bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-14 03:15:19
No, the fact that I'm a great economist is why I have money and you don't.
So in your next reincarnation lifetime, you should listen to my advice.
@_date: 2018-12-12 21:57:16
It would be kinda weird though, if another man stepped up and proved himself Satosh.
Then Wright would be like: "Err.. er... I lied..."
It's just unthikable to me that he isn't S.N.
