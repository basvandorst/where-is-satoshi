You've [said this]( 2 weeks ago:


Sorry, but I can't believe you are not helping the single thing that allowed you to give so much to causes: Bitcoin.
What you did here is called backstabbing.
Why don't you allocate 1 single million in bounties related to make it easier to use Bitcoin and its upcoming features (e.g. LN)? It could be in the simple form of github bounties...
I really admired your fund until I've read this post... It blew up everything.

@_date: 2018-01-20 09:25:05
I don't think they are happy about this, they have a 6 years old code base that must be scary to touch, especially since it must have been written before any solid bitcoin lib was built.
So now they must be working on some deep refactoring to support segwit, and scaling the platform might be even higher priority.
Not accepting a customer or losing a customer because the site can't handle the load has way more ROI to fix than paying lower fees, especially for a VC backed startup in growth mode.

By mentioning "pay them for proprietary sidechains", you show that you clearly don't understand Sidechains and Layer 2.
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:18:49
If your solution is really efficient, it will have consensus and be accepted. But throwing a short term solution to a long term problem like "big blocks" has clearly showed it's not a solution that has consensus, it gives a little more linear scale at the cost of security, hence the fork.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:24:03
Yes, but as all micro transaction will be incentivized to move to the LN (because it's instant+cheap), the blockchain will be less crowded and thus fees could go down again, but not down enough to buy coffee.

Yes, but at some point it would have been harder to fix the problem, or lost security, and it would have been too late.
It's easy to make big blocks, it's harder to optimize them.

Wrong, in lighting network you only know about the last peer, you should read about it before assuming.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:36:55
I am interested, I knew this already:
- Increase default block-size limit, and move towards adaptive block size limit
- Move toward canonical transaction order, perhaps removing transaction ordering consensus rule as a first step.
- Improved Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm
- Re-activate some deactivated Opcodes, and move toward adding protocol extension points to facilitate future Opcode upgrades
Not much. The only feature I see is around the blocksize limit, which is again a constant change.


Same for LN, give it time ;)

Regulations are good for some things and bad for other. If you come up with such statement as "we need to regulate everything|nothing", you are wrong.
e.g. Healthcare needs regulation unless you think the weaks don't deserve to live, the Internet needs regulation because the small have no chance to compete against the bigs if the play field is not fair.
And Bitcoin by itself **is** a regulation like you said: It enforces the rules (scarcity, granularity, entry price, ...) in the system and not in the hands of central banks.

Don't trust people, hear their argument and go document yourself. If you don't understand why an argument is valid or not, dig more. Get "Mastering Bitcoin" by Andreas. Spending the time to read a book is totally worth the money you can win or lose.
I gave up trying to counter argument in r/btc, it's now a dedicated bcash subreddit downvoting to hell anything that does not pump the price, all while the price slowly tanks day after day. It's now a cult.








I too did bad investments in the past years in crypto, and I did not follow the "optimal line" I could have followed. But I noticed that I learnt a lot along the way, and I'm now way more wealthy than I would have been if I followed the path I should have followed without learning. I see the coins I lost as an investment, and it paid off. That's a tough journey, but you are learning and improving every day, unless you are a stubborn idiot or a cultist. And you are not, your post is proof.
You've been burnt, more people are gonna get burnt, most of us have been burnt, but that's how you learn, and you are now stronger than before.

Again impossible to know, how can you know which of the transaction is the legit one? Ask the recipient.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:30:23
Short answer: Yes you need to allocate bitcoins that you plan to use on the network, like I said, it's like the VISA network: You have a debit account somewhere (a channel), you allocate USD on it, and you can spend it on the network (Like you can use your VISA debit card on any shop accepting VISA).

@_date: 2017-12-03 04:25:50
Read about LN, it's a p2p protocol on top of the blockchain, TXs do not have to be on the blockchain, only the delta of your balance when you want to close your channel.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:57:56
It's so amazing you need to be blind to believe bcash and its 10 mins confirmation is the solution!
I just ordered an article on Yalls and a Blockaccino on Stablocks in a few seconds, and both stores completed their orders instantly!
All in a single channel because it leverage the network.

Wall Street knows bcash is easier to bend than the truly decentralized Bitcoin: They have weak leaders (Ver, the other CEO guy, FakeSatoshi, ...) that are only looking for money: Easy to buy. They want them as their partner. Both Wall Street and bcash want a centralized coin.
It might pump bcash a little, but it's not gonna last...
TLDR; HODL Bitcoin, it's holding well given the attack.
@_date: 2018-09-14 18:45:31


It's not, you can't used a channel that's not confirmed yet. I think he's talking about the ability to move funds and create a channel in the same TX, instead of having to wait confirmation between each.

Right, the battle is between LN and IOTA to simplify. But LN has the Bitcoin historical advantage.
IMO if LN is successful, IOTA will lose that market, and if not, IOTA has a chance to be used as a currency on top of its original IOT promise.
Both are not really usable yet mainstream, and both are improving pretty fast, it's a race.

That's because the bank is loaning you the money automatically. Try paying a $500 TV with a debit card with $10 on the account...
I'm just fucking using the debit card analogy to explain the concept. Don't fucking lecture me on the difference between the LN and the VISA network, oh god...


You'll get shit with a debit card backed by 0 $USD. Try. You can open an empty Channel BTW, as useless as an empty Debit Card, but it moot your point.

8MB is solving nothing: 40TX/s while VISA is doing 2000...


zero conf is a marketing gimmick backed by zero actual fact. Zero conf is insecure and that's why nobody relies on it and we have a blockchain.


You can't replace a payment network in 1 week, it takes years. I'd rather spend the energy on replacing VISA once we have a solution that's gonna work if it's successful. I don't want to spend the energy of the community to replace VISA with a solution that's gonna break if it's being used (e.g. bcash, LTC or others)


I doubt it, no feature has been added to bcash since the fork, good luck implementing LN without Segwit... Sorry but bcash devs are not in the same league, and are now lead by Roger &amp; co, which are more political than technical.

The main advantage is censorship resistance (no government can take my Bitcoins in my back) and no correlation to anything else (if the printing of USD continue, or we find a new huge gold mine, BTC value will still continue its own life).
Secondary advantages are: it cost nothing to store, and almost nothing to transfer.
But don't forget the main advantage.

No, only the sum of all transaction will be stored in the blockchain when you close it: If you do 5 TX in LNs: +5-1-1+3-2 you'll only have to write +4 on the blockchain when closing the channel.
The only node that will have a lot of from/to addresses will be the largest payment providers, say bitmain, and they'll certainly have the infrastructure/redundancy/benefits to cover the cost of such transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:59:48


No. Let's not break the security model for cheap unscalable solution.


It's not, it's relying on the good will of miners adding TXs to the blockchain in order. Nobody is gonna rely on a coin that relies on the goodwill of miners. The point of Bitcoin is to not have to trust anyone.
The rest is just the same shit talked and debated over and over.

Who uses Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash right now to buy stuff? It's a niche, better fix the main issue while it's still a niche.
Bcash people sound like VISA is being replaced now, it's not, it's gonna take months if not years to go mainstream, LN is around the corner. If you replace any VISA shop with a bcash shop right now, bcash will have the exact same issue as Bitcoin had. It can scale 10x at most, it's not a solution. And BTW, both ETH and LTC can scale more. Scaling without security is not what everyone is looking for.
If the main target of bcash is small miners cashing out, sure, go ahead, but LTC or ETH could do the job as well.
We are talking about 1.000x or even 1.000.000x transactions here, LN can handle those, no onchain coin can handle those.
So yeah, keep focusing on those small problems while the big issue is being tackled on.

Until next time and next time and next time...
And each "next time" requires a hard fork.
Let the fees stabilize and you won't ever need a hard fork, all by still letting the little players able to mine (by keeping the 1MB blockchain)
@_date: 2016-03-02 23:39:50


@_date: 2016-03-01 17:27:35
It will be exponentially more expensive, while increasing the blockchain will be linearly more expensive.
It's way more simple and cheaper for Bitcoin to increase the fees by x100 than the blockchain size.
@_date: 2016-03-01 18:46:46
Unless you have an unlimited blockchain (which can only happen in a magical world) you have to have a limit.
Better deal with a smart way to deal with the limit now.
@_date: 2016-03-04 23:23:14


If this was right, and Core followed his strategy to hardfork to 2MB now, in his scenario, we would still end up at 70% capacity, with another hardfork needed to cope with the blockchain demand in a few weeks.
What a nice future. Hard fork over hard forks, leaving a greater percentage behind at each fork.
And what about the time when the reward block will tend to 0?
That's a very short sighted plan. If you want something that will last years, you have to rely on the fee market to pay for the hashing power, and keeping it at 1MB will make this needed balance happen sooner.

Let the market settle on the right fee price, and spamming will be too expensive.

@_date: 2016-01-29 15:50:37
I agree with this, but my concern is that the blockchain noise you hear now is not a fair representation of the people using, trusting, and investing (time and money) in Bitcoin.
If it just takes a few posts on reddit to change what bitcoin is, it's pretty scary.
We need a way to assess what those people want, and right now the direction is given by a balance of who runs the most nodes, and who reviews the code; which is not ideal, but still better than anything else proposed so far.
 is a move in the right direction, but it's still young.
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:03:35
If it takes $2000 to spam the 1MB blockchain to have people complain about transaction delays, a 2MB blockchain won't solve the problem (it will cost $4000, which is still nothing for someone who want to harm BTC).
The only viable solution is to let the market decide on the right fee price, so that spam becomes way too expensive to be done.
Yes, the fees will rise, there is no way around this. A 1GB blockchain with low fees will still be spammed the same way.
That's a very good reason to keep the blockain at 1MB and let the fees go up to a reasonable rate (too expensive for spam, but low enough for the legit users)
@_date: 2016-03-02 00:05:11

@_date: 2016-03-01 22:35:07
bigger blocks = higher barrier to mine = less miners = more centralization
@_date: 2016-03-02 00:13:42
But the 1MB block size limit lowers the barrier of entry to mine. The larger the blocksize, the less miners you have, and the more bitcoin is centralized, and thus vulnerable.
Bitcoin is a very fragile balance, and that's why changing those constants or any other hardfork is not as simple as it sounds.
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:56:50

No, but the spammers (people who did not want to attend the match, but wanted to annoy other people by buying seats because it was so cheap) would not be able to spam anymore, as it becomes more expensive to spam.
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:15:53
Doubling the blockchain size won't solve this problem as spam will just be 2x as expensive.
Letting the market pay more fees per transaction is the only solution, and it's gonna happen faster with a 1MB blockchain than a 2MB one.
@_date: 2016-03-01 19:26:05

@_date: 2016-01-29 14:38:57
Thank you for taking the time to write this, and as an engineer working on other decentralized scalability problems, i'm totally on par with this.
The challenge is to explain to people why we cannot have hundreds of thousands of transactions per second validated (not even processed) on every single node: it does not scale. And if the limit is reached now (1MB) some people will increase the fees which will put more incentive for the cluster to keep up with the demand, while keeping the blockchain size sustainable for all the current nodes.
Might be doable to process 100x more one day, but until then, let's make bitcoins better and focus on the problems we can solve now.
Like many others, I would certainly loose trust if engineers like you were not owning the roadmap anymore, and I'd just sell and move on. So yes, a hard fork is dangerous even for the short sighted who wants it hoping it will increase the usage and the price.
Keep up the good work!

It's happening (e.g. SegWit), not sure why you think nobody will ever optimize the blockchain anymore.


You are stretching it, I would not open a channel to pay a 1 BTC transaction ($4k...), I might open a channel with 1 BTC allocated to pay small amount on different places, and in this case I only need to find nodes with those small amounts allocated, if I don't already have a channel open with the merchant.


This is different than banking because you still own the BTC on the channels and can cancel the channel anytime, so those bank 2.0 can't steal your money.


The same fee as you have to pay for 1 onchain transaction.
Anyway, if you don't believe it can work, you have Bitcoin Cash, and tons of other coins that bet on on-chain scaling, you even have the option to still use on-chain tx with Bitcoin. I suggest you to give it some chance though...

It is, Litecoin is a fork of Bitcoin, same as Bitcoin Cash except they started a new blockchain.


It's easy to start an altcoin claiming it can scale onchain, but once you reach the scale of bitcoin, problems show up the same, look at Ethereum.


They don't, it's FUD, you have to pay a transaction to open and close a channel, which cost the same as a regular transaction. Read the doc.


You are not giving up power, those are still your coins and the 3rd party can't take them from you.


Up to you, if you believe this, sell your Bitcoin and buy Bcash, it's a free market.


@_date: 2017-08-23 21:30:40
I think you are mixing SegWit and the LN.
Yes, you could imagine a big VISA-like LN channel charging fees, and it would make sense to use it if you were looking for convenience (e.g. if you could pay almost everywhere using this single channel).
Obviously it would never be as high fees as onchain fees, as it would compete with "free" channels.

Let's scale it down to me. I only do "big" transaction when I buy BTC. All my other transactions are small buys.
So let's say I generate 20 TX/month, 1 on Coinbase to buy BTC, and 19 on misc online shops. Without LN I use 20 TX/month. With LN and a monthly channel, I use 3 TX/month.
Of course there will be merchants not supporting LN, but I'm simplifying.
Also as a bonus, my purchases will be instant, instead of having to be confirmed (10 mins minimum).


Some TXs offchain and some TXs onchain is closer to large scale than everything onchain, in every possible way.


Yes, large purchase will stay onchain, but look at any recent block, and only count the TXs moving &gt;=.1BTC, if the blockchain is only used for those, it's an improvement no?
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:48:59

@_date: 2017-08-23 20:30:10


No you are right, and [it's already happening]( but you are 1 year ahead, and I bet you already digested the fact that the LN is the solution to scale bitcoin; so you can focus on the next problem already ;)
The community is slower to digest the tech, and still need to be educated about how to solve our current problem (onchain scaling).
@_date: 2017-08-23 22:01:46


Fee won't cost $100 in the near future, because
1. segwit optimize the blockchain use, freeing the blockchain
2. When LN works, most transactions will happen offchain, freeing the blockchain again
3. The market will make the price: If fees are too expensive: less activity -&gt; less TXs -&gt; less fees. You just make up numbers to validate your point
Imagine if fees are up to $100 one day, it means BTC will be worth so much more because people will actually pay this money for TXs...


In the one use case of day 2 day payments, you are right, we are certainly gonna have a few big payment channels, exactly like we have today with Bitpay and coinbase. Nothing wrong with that.


You are stretching it again... They will be competing with free channels, and their only advantage will be convenience, the market won't pay them if too expensive/cumbersome.


So? Exactly like now with all those bitcoin payment platforms + debit cards. Again you are focusing on one specific use case and throwing the baby with the water. Yes, there will be a VISA and a Mastercard on LN, but backed by the Bitcoin blockchain, with instant and free TXs (or almost free if they choose). P2P channels and onchain are still a thing though, and they'll compete with those.


Exactly, it's gonna be super easy to setup new channels, even p2p channels work.


Yes, the paid channels will compete against onchain TX fees, but also against other free channels.


All good, that's the point of hardfork, good luck too (with BCH I guess).
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:18:33
Nobody will use the LN with even $100 fees.
I'm like you, I'm a perfectionist and I like to have "pure solutions". But with Bitcoin, we just have to solve one scaling problem after another and pick one concession. By the time the fees are $1000, we'll certainly have other problems to solve, and new means to solve those.
Big onchain blocks will scale 10x at most, 2nd layer solutions like LN can easily scale the same blockchain by 100x minimum by removing some of the small TXs from the blockchain while keeping the same security: It can buy us a few years vs. a few months with big blocks.

SegWit is live on Litecoin for weeks.


Because it's not, sidechains is not useful for scaling.


No, CPU, latency, RAM, storage space are all needed resources. We are already debating over a 1MB block size and we can only do 5 tx/sec. With a 100MB block size (which is insane), we would do 500 tx/sec. VISA is doing 2000 tx/sec alone... Do you think you can replace VISA by using bigger computers?
The blockchain is just not optimized for small transactions, I don't need to know you gave $2 to starbucks before I spend my 50$ on Steam.
ELI5: the point of LN and 2nd layer is to use the blockchain as a big ledger (bank accounts) and use layer 2 p2p transactions as debit cards. You would not wire $2 to Starbucks.

This is really an edge case. LN does not prevent you to receive, you just have to be online, and most stores are online 24/7 as it's cheap to be. For P2P payment, jump online. For the rest, which is rarely occuring, you have lots of alternatives: onchain address, 3rd party, ... All options are valid.


Did you even used it? I opened 1 channel on mainnet in April and have been buying regularly with it, total: 1TX instead of a bunch.
So because LN is still costing TXs, we should give up? What about the fact that each TX can now host thousands?

I question Tether as much as every shitcoin worth billions, not more not less. AFAIK as long as people get 1 USD per Tether, it's worth what it's worth, and it's all suppositions that could be applied to any crypto/exchange out there. I have yet to see any proof that's it's less backed than the others.
What I don't like is those fake stories about Tether based on pure conspiracy, while there are way bigger issues that are hurting crypto: e.g. Tron and NEO are worth more than Tether right now... Remember when BitConnect market cap was worth more than Tether?

I meant in the future, sorry, we have so many stories of people losing everything because they trusted coin's blogposts. e.g. recently NEM died while people were believing blog posts like this: [


It's really not, but some people (included me) don't like frauds and feel the need to call some out. You can understand I'm not gonna spend a week getting facts in a way that's easy to understand, someone has to sponsor the debunking work, and as with fake news, this takes more time to debunk fake than to build it: In crypto there is still way more incentive to make up stuff than to debunk it (it's changing though with the death of ICOs).
I'm an engineer and I usually agree with other engineers which are tagged "maximalists", not because I'm religious, but because I follow the most rational peoples, the ones that don't stop at blog posts but unroll the problems, edge cases and outcomes to their ends.
Re. IOTA, they also blogged that JINN was great and all, and abandoned it. Why do you believe them for the COO while technically it does not make sense and they already deceived people? Why don't you wait for them to remove the COO before instead of trusting them.
Re. NANO, this is even more simple: sharding is a known tech in CS for years if not decades, you can't shard without a strong isolation between shards. They shard by blockchains. If your blockchain has a link to all the other blockchains, this is not sharding anymore as everything needs to be in sync to verify each transaction: TLDR; it works less and less as it's being used more and more.

It sets a precedent though: If you can get some ETH by the rules (what the DAO hacker did), but the king of ETH does not like the way you got them, then he can seize those.

You won't find much literature about because this information is downvoted or fakely debunked on any resource of those, so people just move on once they figure this out and let those community circle-jerk.

Security. Would you trust those 3 clowns to not change any constant in the future? In the hypothesis that miners can't cover their investment anymore with the mining reward (which is the only thing that pays miners, fees being too low), don't you think they'll be tempted to do a backdoor deal to increase the number of coins to help miners?
Governance is way more important, and Bitcoin has 10 years of a perfect track record that no other altcoin can match. And the reason is: Bitcoin has a dead king: Satoshi.

@_date: 2017-11-18 17:36:45
Yes, moving small transactions on a second layer is a way to achieve this, lightning network is one implementation.
Most people don't get the big picture, but miners electricity and hardware is paid by the network: fee+reward. Reward being an hidden inflation.
Higher fees are not necessarily a bad thing: it means people value their transaction more, the network is maturing and protecting itself against low value transactions, as the blockchain is finite.
Nobody cares enough about BCH, but if you spam it the same, you'll get the same fee increases.

Again, side chains were never intended to solve scaling, you've misunderstood.
I agree though that some altcoins might do a better job at day to day cash, but Bitcoin (and not Blockstream) solution is to multiply on chain scaling by adding other layers.

Yes, for a very long time: 
The next blockers will be the transactions needed to open/close a channel, that will need to stay onchain, but this is a scaling problems that will only happen in a long time, and only if it is very successful already.
Bcash is scaling by 2x, LN is scaling it by 1000x+

Misleading title.
TLDR; a conceptual flaw was talked about on the devs mailing list in May 2018, someone brought it back up recently, and solutions to the flaw are already coming up, like adding a 3rd party to put boundaries on the transaction.
It's not impacting the running LN, not much to see here.

Even if it was the case (and it's not), 10 minutes blocks would never compete with VISA...
You need a fee-less and seconds confirmed coin to compete for day to day payments. There are already some altcoins doing this (e.g. iota, bytecoin, ...), and even bitcoin+LN... bcash is doomed.

That's short sighted: $90 billion is nothing compared to leaving the crooks in charge, thus preparing the ground for the next bigger crisis.
Basically, the banks have been fined "$90b over multiple years" for playing at the casino and making tons more money with almost no risk. And now it's worse because they know the risk is low...

The weakness is that people with power (CEOs) don't understand how dangerous this hard fork without replay protection is. Those people are supposed to not work against Bitcoin...

@_date: 2017-09-07 19:13:04


What does it change to the fact that each transaction has to be written to the blockchain?


If it's so tiny then why the blockchain is so big?


It relates to who's paying the miners electricity. Right now it's transactions fees+mining fees (mining fee == hidden inflation). And as mining rewards tend to 0, transaction fees have to cover up.

Because your transaction has to be on the ledger, and thus your transaction has to be processed by all the nodes of the network. That's why this paradigm has to be broken (e.g. by the LN or by non blockchain coins).

It is, if you want to DDOS them, you can still find the nodes by other means, like the user agent and their stupid version number (1.14.X instead of 0.14.X)

Huh? So everybody else did nothing? ��
@_date: 2017-10-04 20:44:14
Privacy?! What kind of privacy does this brings to the table?
- It only allows to bypass core bans
- It does not hide s2x nodes from the network as they still show up with the weird 1.14.X version, so no privacy at all.
- Of course u/jgarzik locked the commit comments so nobody can state this
It amazes me that people cry for blockstream owing core while in the mean time only 1 sole guy is merging code in btc1 without any PR or feedback.
Makes sense to give out a $70B market cap to a sole dev without any way to balance his actions. /s

Exactly, worst case, if Bitcoin Core dies, most (devs included) will flee out of crypto or to some other coin, as another coin will certainly fill the void.

As soon as a validator is not following the rules, it's off the list. This is exactly the same as if Ripple was running those.
And being the default is crucial. If you don't use this UNL, you actually don't use the same rules and it's the same as using a fork.

If we loose 90% power, guess what, it will be 9x slower for 2 weeks worse case. It would cost an insane amount of money for a very low ROI to activate such a move, suppose some would drive 90% of haspower directly or indirectly. Better fork away if you have 90% hash power (and loose your users...)

It's not, if we lose 50% hashpower, then for a maximum of 2016 blocks (~2 weeks) then transactions will be mined 2x as slow.
Not a big deal given that's been a while we don't take 10mins transactions for granted anymore...
But this is the worst case scenario, and it's not really a big deal, and you can bet other miners will want to take a pie of the missing hashpower and fill the void for the cash.
So the worst, which we can totally survive, can't happen anyway.
TLDR; this would cost millions of $ to miners for a really small effect.

Imagine the malicious guys, who already own most of the bootstrap nodes, prepare a network of 1000 malicious nodes, not that hard to set up, right? In their code, they enforce the fact that those nodes can only share the IP of a malicious node, one of those 1000. This is of course a closed source fork of the OSS btc1 code, but you can't tell they are running it from the outside.
1. When you start your new btc1 node, you connect to the list of bootstrap nodes, running the malicious closed source fork.
1. If all those bootstrap nodes are malicious you are gonna be given a list of IPs of malicious nodes.
1. Those malicious nodes will only share IPs of other malicious nodes.
In the end, your open source btc1 node will only ever talk to malicious btc1 nodes, and you can be force-fed their own version of the blockchain without knowing.
I hope it helps because I doubt I can explain it better.

**To the people that actually give a fuck:** this is a problem because we can't know what those nodes are running, they could run a modified version of the code that are only gonna spread IPs of nodes running this modified version. It's easy and you can't easily detect it. With this in place, you can imagine this code to do everything: Send real coins to some hardcoded addresses, run some hardfork in disguise, logging IP addresses, ...
You can imagine everything. And the argument being that those nodes are never used is false: Those are the root nodes, the nodes that are to be trusted on any network or software incompatibility event: When you can't connect to nodes, you fallback to them. **It's like giving the root DNS servers to Verizon and Comcast.**
So yeah, they could silently deploy harmful code on those nodes and force people, slowly and silently, to only connect to their nodes. From this point, more and more full nodes will be at their mercy, isolated from the real Bitcoin network.
**To the people who think this is not a problem:** Run it, good riddance, Bitcoin does not need blind people trusting Jihan Ver more than code. You are actually trusting your bitcoins to some people telling you they won't be evil: You don't deserve Bitcoin at this point.

If your node can be given a valid but different blockchain than the main one, because all the peers you connect to are malicious too (even just 51% of the peers), anything can happen to you. It does not mean the blockchain will be invalid, you can still verify it fine, it just won't be the main one and the malicious authors can do whatever they want that's allowed on a blockchain.

That's where I think you are wrong. It sounds like you gave up. I deeply think nobody with serious stakes - even Jihan - will run serious stuff on segwit2x. Mark my words.
We are 1 week before deadline and crazy PRs that have nothing to do with the initial contract are pushed down segwit2x throat. It has not really been tested yet. And people think 80% of a $30B network will run this in 1 week?!

They are both known to not putting words into action.
Craig said he would prove he's Satoshi, and gave up. I highly doubt he can deliver 20% hashrate in such a short time frame. Even with the cash, it would mean producing a lot of miners in a very short timeframe, without using them, so keeping them at a big loss. 
McAfee is another big mouth, you can find lots of acts he did on the net. In bitcoin, his mining company cannot have any serious impact, he said he would get ~1300 bitmain miners, so something like 17PH/s, that's 0.3% of the total hashrate approx. And it's all just McAfee talk, which like Craig has a tendency to say BS.
I seriously hope they'll finally fork off on this attempt, but sadly, I highly doubt it and they'll come back to Bitcoin their tail between their legs.

If I was Coinbase, I would certainly be super careful before giving out access to a $200k account to someone claiming he owns the account by email.
Another possibility is that your coinbase credentials got stolen and you've been locked out by the one who stole them...

Not if it's thought out, e.g. making sure the commodity used to mine is common enough, and already optimized with lots of R&amp;D, like CPUs or GPUs. The problem with SHA256 ASICs is that's a domain where no R&amp;D have been done before, so Bitmain did it, and now they keep it for them as they make more money mining then selling them.
They sell a few, but more as an excuse to not be an obvious monopoly.
But as Andreas, I'm optimistic that it's just a matter of time with ASICs: 
@_date: 2017-07-16 04:48:14
All this could have been avoided if the miners just signaled segwit with Bitcoin Core, which is exactly what segwit2x is supposed to do for 3 months, but no, they prefer to run btc1 instead.

And that's exactly what he's saying: The bandaid is to bypass the P2P consensus and explicitly specify who to connect to, hence their "own super-net".
That's fine for a short-time fix to get segwit, but it's not something you can rely on long term.

No, a lot of people would mine even if they would not make much money out of it.
I mine a little just for the sake of decentralization, I don't really make any real money out of it.

I bet you we won't hear about Jihan in a few years, he will loose his "advantage", he's just "the" miner nowadays, nothing more.
We don't hear much about Ghash anymore.
Regarding farms, you can see with ETH that GPU mining is doing well, a lot of western people bought GPUs to mine on their own, that's all we need.

The point he makes is that once we hit the wall (we did), those ASICs will start being accessible to everyone and people will mine even for a few bucks, but thousands if not millions of them will mine.
Once that happens, mining won't be a job anymore, because people will do it for cheaper, they won't care if it's not profitable, they ll do it for the independence of Bitcoin, or even as a way to buy bitcoins (you pay electricity in USD, you get some coins).
You can already buy Bitmain's top of the line ASIC on a USB stick and mine, but it's only one guy building them, because jihan still keep the chips for himself...

I don't see any scenario with 2x succeeding:
- If segwit2x fork is a success, the 2x coins are now centralized. Price of 2x coins over time: $0
- If segwit2x fork is a failure: Price of 2x coins: $0
I'll just sell mine ASAP whatever happens.
@_date: 2017-07-16 01:05:41


At this point, lot of harm would have already been done. Why taking the chance and letting go such a change? There is no need for such a change, it's just an another attempt to replace the current equilibrium.
Even a btc1 PR to forward all transaction to an hardcoded address would be excused by his fanboys... So much proofs have been shown, it's helpless.
I seriously hope the fork will not die so that people who don't value decentralization in Bitcoin can stop trying to fuck it up and stick to their fork.

If it's the price to pay for Miner decentralization, it's not that bad. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 19:15:45


No, actually you are right: I think we should let this Segwint2x joke fork away without any protection and let it confuse the few addicts who will use it.
The main chain being Core of course, Segwit2x is hardforking, not the other way.
@_date: 2017-07-16 04:36:55

IMO won't take off, even if they don't hardfork it, the fact that the eth blockchain only check balances and there is no system to check transaction makes it very weak.
I HODL BTC because I know people can't fuck it up: If they want to change a balance, they have to rewrite every past transaction related to it.
I don't have to watch BTC 24/7 for a few years, I can just HODL. There are too many ways Eth can be changed.
@_date: 2017-07-06 23:13:54
Miners have to be paid to mine:
- Either you pay them in fees
- Either you pay them with new bitcoins
Right now we do both, but in the long term, the code says only fees will pay them. If you don't sign on this idea, you should go with an inflated coin, e.g. ethereum.
@_date: 2017-07-15 09:52:12

@_date: 2017-07-16 03:58:34
If all the nodes you connect run the same malicious software, because the malicious ones you bootstrap to only give you other malicious nodes, your node can be given a totally different blockchain as your node will never connect to the main network, ever. They just need you node to connect to 50% of their malicious nodes, easy if they own the bootstrap ones.
Then you can imagine all kind of malicious stuff to do if I can give your node the blockchain I want, of course I'll give you a valid blockchain, but maybe not the same TX history as the main one.
But you know what, that's totally fine, run segwit2x, as long as I'm not forced to, I'm good ;)

The holders of a $40B market cap would not let some kids risk so much money if it was a possibility, lots would sell.

Yes, and a lot can happen, e.g. they can make you think you they sent you a payment while it never happened on the main chain.

You are free to believe this, most people don't.

Bitcoin Independence day: UASF
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:25:27
It's the point: a while is gonna be a few years here, vs. a few months before, that's exactly what is needed to even out access to those chips to everyone.
ASICs catch up with CPUs, that's where we are now, but they won't break the barrier that CPUs are facing (CPUs have way more R&amp;D budget, and they are stuck) , so it's gonna be a status-quo for a while, and the exclusivity of those few miners will dilute.

I was just trying to comment there (what a waste of my time...) and just noticed this...
How can you call out this `r/bitcoin == blockstream` rant all day with this amount of "sponsorship" ?!
@_date: 2017-06-16 20:32:29
And to their credit, this worked as long as users==miners.
Until 16nm ASICs become a commodity, it is not true anymore.
@_date: 2017-06-17 04:07:59


Nobody's right or wrong, miners will have nothing to mine without users. If users are patient enough to get rid of the ownership of miners, they can wait for the difficulty to settle. It's even easier for users: they are not loosing any money.
The real question is: Do we want Bitcoin's roadmap to be owned by miners?
- Yes? Go with Segwit2x
- No? Go with UASF
We'll see what the result will be, but nobody right now knows the outcome, you &amp; me included.
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:49:00
1. Pure political agenda (e.g. trying to bundle it with a HF)
2. ASICBOOST
3. FUD

Because that's what's happening for ASICs, same happened for CPU, we are stuck around 16nm and that's where ASICs are now, so there is no way to get ahead of others by going smaller anymore, for a while.
Because of this more and more manufacturers will have access to 16nm and thus more and more consumers -&gt; decentralization.
@_date: 2017-06-30 21:29:51
So, fake satoshi joined a patent troll company whose job is to write patents covering bitcoin, and lobbying for bigblocks compliant miners/companies.
I hope he'll do what he says, fork off and enjoy his patent protected crypto that can only be run on supercomputers.
@_date: 2017-06-02 22:27:00
piggyback a 2MB hardfork in it which has no consensus, and change the signaling of SegWit so that all the current effort go to waste, for no technical reason except for postponing its activation...
They just want Bitcoin to stay in the current status-quo. UASF is the only way to move out of this clusterfuck. Miners are supposed to mine our blocks, not to block features.
@_date: 2018-12-08 19:41:07
Finally! This is great! Shit is finally happening!
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:32:16

Funny how you keep calling UASF astroturfers while being a redditor for 2 weeks...
Can't wait for Aug 1st, worst case, you folks repeating your religion without understanding what you say will be free to follow your Segwit2x fork and put your bitcoins on your words.

Those 2 will just follow the users, they can't take as much risk as Bitmain can, like missing a few hours of revenue.
They would not be able to explain such lack of foresight to their VCs.
@_date: 2017-06-30 03:32:25
Can't wait for Aug 1st to see all those negative people about UASF either shut up for good or fork away with their beloved JihanCoin.
Seriously, this is great, users have 1k full nodes and a bunch of miners. It's totally enough to have a working bitcoin past 1st Aug.
And I'd rather have a slow and independent bitcoin for a while starting Aug 1st, than a bitcoin with the roadmap handled by the segwit2x/BU/XT/Whatever other POS they try to push every quarter.
Miners mine what users use! They don't dictate the roadmap. UASF!
@_date: 2017-06-24 03:45:54
Define crash: Bitcoin will certainly crash from $3k to $2k at some point (ballpark), -33% is a crash for Wall Street.

Centralization is not a good trade-off, once it's too centric, it's too late to go back.
The only option would be a nuclear POW change to get out of the mess.

I'm not saying it's not used, I'm saying that even if it's not, the fact that the code is live is useful.
If there was not interest in it, it would not have been merged...
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:37:46
That's perfect, Jihan is forking and mining his BitmainCoin away from Bitcoin and we can finally move on without them!
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:46:05
Maybe but I'm not asking for help, was just surprised by the numbers ;)
@_date: 2017-06-16 20:02:30
Finally, actors start to be pragmatic.
- Users use the software they want
- Exchange serve their customers
- Miners validate what users do
How simple is that? Users vote by "using", and tell miners what to mine.
Miners should not decide, they should just mine...
@_date: 2018-12-09 06:21:38
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:56:07
And you like the idea of mining being reserved to those few having access to this "work"?
I bet you love the idea of ASICBOOST too.
Once bitcoin cannot be decentralized anymore, it's not gonna be worth any other crappy altcoin.
I guess you don't care, you just want to be able to buy coffee with it, or just cash out your investment ASAP...
@_date: 2017-06-19 06:28:08
Then just buy those altcoins that already have those big Blockchain already... 
Interesting that each time a new hard fork project shows up, the price tanks.  
@_date: 2017-06-30 04:35:55
**Users use, miners mine.**
Since when do we need to ask the miners "please can you mine my blockchain?".
We just use a blockchain and if miners are interested in its fees, they mine it.
@_date: 2017-06-09 16:44:07
Not really, when shit happens, all the altcoins tank, people usually get back Bitcoin.

I tried bitbet in the past and sorry, but I'm not trying again, it's very easy to lose your coins.
Also if bitbet is not supporting segwit, your coins might become BitmainCoins in august, before the bet ends, heh.

What do you mean? The is only one 
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:50:23
Hopefully, ASICs will become a commodity soon and everyone will be able to mine again: decentralization!
Beautifully explained by Andreas: 
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:49:38
Not at all, Bitcoin is doing great too without giving up on any principle so far
@_date: 2017-06-07 05:50:29


But that might also be why it's so successful. I sold all my ETH the day they decided to hardfork to rewrite the blockchain history.
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:53:57
You are right, let's do this... after UASF.
@_date: 2017-06-16 18:19:36
This mailing list is just a sibling of r/btc


Not worth much.
@_date: 2016-07-21 16:21:22
Their blockchain is now mutable. I sold all my ETH because I simply lost trust in it.
On the other side, I HODL BTC because it showed that big *unfair* events like MTGox or SilkRoad did not lead to a hardfork.
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:23:54
If tomorrow Vitalik decides to add a 0 to its balance, he can.
In bitcoin, you have to rewrite the whole blockchain.
That was the final nail in the coffin to not consider Ethereum as a currency anymore for me.
@_date: 2017-06-09 18:34:22
It's worth hours of debating, and there is no real answer, time will tell.
My thinking is that democratic countries at some point will regulate Bitcoins (not IRS regulation, real laws about it), because they won't be able to do anything else (like blocking it, or letting it go). Same happened to the Internet, to P2P, ... Each country come with it's own regulation, which is kind of never really enforced, because it's too late and the population has already embraced the tech.
It's different of course for non democratic countries...
Regarding your other point (power), if you keep Bitcoin decentralized enough, it will always be more powerful than any centralized attempts (e.g. even now, if the Fed does something really anti-citizen, 300M citizens are still able to kick the fed in the butt, given a dramatic enough reason, even with drones and bombs).
Bitcoin is too young, and the only thing we need to make sure, is to keep it decentralized. Its biggest treat nowadays are Jihan's club, mainly due to their quasi exclusive access to 16nm ASICs, and big blockers, because it increases the hardware needed to mine and run a full node, which makes it less affordable to run for more and more people.
That's why we need UASF to succeed: To make sure the mass users are still able to protect bitcoin from any centralization attempt.
All this is just my POV, it's worth this much.
@_date: 2017-06-30 22:42:12
Even if a discussion leads to a PR, you don't merge a PR immediately after creating it, it's called a "Pull Request" for a reason.
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:18:53
Now that the big blockers lost and are trying to save the face (by signaling Segwit "their way"), they don't have to spam the blockchain to prove their point anymore.
No point wasting this propaganda money anymore.

It's not over until it's actually live. UASF.
@_date: 2017-06-23 05:25:29
Hello "redditor for 2 weeks".
Do not worry, if you persist a few more weeks, you'll understand why wanting a hard fork to increase the blockchain by 1MB is short sighted and counter productive.
Good luck in your journey.

Coinbase are down the street in SF, I know some, and I doubt their business is to steal customer money. The people working there are smart and they would work somewhere else and not waste their time there if it was a shady company.
High fees, full blocks, and redditors sharing only one side of their story are a lot of factors here.
I'm using Coinbase, I'm IDed there and I never had an issue buying or selling bitcoins. I'm pretty sure the problematic users are a minority and there is a valid reason behind those problems.
Look at the 1st problem I clicked:  some gambler is blaming Coinbase and mixing fees with his money...
Would be good if coinbase was as transparent as bitcoin so we could all see what's happening in those 100ish cases, but sadly they can't share details.

They don't want it to fail, they want to dictate the roadmap. But their roadmap is bound to failure.
Either they are too stupid to see it, either they know it will fail and just want some quick cash for a few months.
Either way they know the real value is behind core or they would have triggered a hard fork long ago...

Yeah, but 45s to generate an address with 5 starting char, I guess it would be 2mins at least to generate one with both start and end characters, and the script kiddie on the other side has to know the address and the private key.
I don't think something as complex will happen soon. Anyway, if I need to get used to also checking some characters in the middle, I'll just do it.
