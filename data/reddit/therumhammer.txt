They’re FDIC and I know we just can’t trust that, but if it’s a bitcoin run on the bank situation the FDIC will still be around to cover their butt. Can’t see the FDIC not doing anything unless it’s an over all US government issue in which case coinbase probably wouldn’t be the one crashing.

How easily you can find and buyer and sell is the liquidity. Maybe there wasn’t a lot of liquidity when it first started but you can easily sell now. But think of maybe smaller alt coins with market caps of like like $100,000 they might not be very liquid. U might not be able to find a buyer
@_date: 2018-05-15 17:56:16
Yea I see where you’re coming; and Well it wouldn’t be more taxed if they convert it immediately because btc price would be constant so no gains made on holding the btc for the short time held. So I understand.

Ah nothing like a good hearty wholesome laugh in the morning. I’ll see you on the other side 
@_date: 2018-05-08 02:26:22
Well I don’t think that ever ever happens because if there isn’t many people wanting to buy then nobody is bidding the price up so the price falls down lower and it gets lower and lower until someone says hey that’s good deal and buys and then more people agree and that’s how the prices go back up. 
My tip of wisdom is just buy and hold because you already lost $300 but just think if u had bought 1 year ago today and just held till now, great gains. And then picture yourself 1 year from now thanking yourself for buying now. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 01:48:59

@_date: 2018-05-22 20:34:38
I’ve been here for over a year and I know years ago this was not the trend but since I’ve been in this is just how things go. After the crash u just kinda sit around waiting for big movement and then all of a sudden you take a look at some charts and see the things clear as day all lining up and can see that in a couple weeks things will probably boom, we’ll get there. It just takes some time. Don’t doubt don’t sell. Get your favorite coins and don’t doubt btc to be the first to have big movement where you can then diversify more afterwards.

Haven’t watched the video yet. Been in the space for over a year. 
The verse “the love of money is the root of all evil” comes to mind often. Life is not about accumulating value and it’s not  about a lot of other things closely related. 
I feel this post deeply, I’ve gone through a period of having very vivid grand dreams creating a bio engineering firm, followed by a period of time where I was set on the idea to chase simplicity by building and living in a cabin in Montana alone for the rest of my life, followed by (now) a time inbetween those extremes where I think I’m on the right path and asking myself the right questions and finding the right answers, why, why do we do anything that we do. I really think that God is real and that life is all tied to the Christian God. It just all makes sense to me. And I’ve been really taking to heart the parable in the Bible when a king or someone gives his servants a set of money and leaves and returns and sees what they did with it and it’s like that phrase about being trusted with a little before being trusted with a lot comes to mind every day. Idk what I’m saying at this point but I think that doing the simple things well and doing them in the good spirit of Gods love and living in the moment and not overthinking life is important and a good start to rebuilding your life after being very depressed. Just making your bed in the morning is the simplest thing and then build from there. I want to get a simple job like at a coffee shop and planning to just do my best to give every customer a nice smile and kindness and being dressed in simple happiness and feel God smiling at me for trying to be like him in the small simple ways. But I might start a business this summer which is a huge jump from that but things are just lining up after making a few crazy gut feeling type decisions. Last year I dropped out of college after studying engineering 3 years, traveled for a while and felt it again so I came home and in January I started my first career type job - a good one- and had that feeling again and quit the very first day and signed up for business classes at my local
Community college, and if I hadn’t done that I wouldn’t have met this now good friend that has helped me stop drinking myself to death and he just retired and is an accounting/tax wiz and we might start a business now. You just have to keep that door open to listen to God giving you those nudges. 
Don’t get caught up in all that crazy tradition stuff with religion, it’s just like in the Bible with the Pharisees. The Bible says that man cannot look up at the stars without knowing Jesus is lord so for me that has a deep meaning, that Our understanding of God is shallow compared to how deep it could be if were able to look past the perceived laws of our world. I know that vibrations is the wrong word for it but it’s the only one that I have to describe this other dimension that I think every one feels but doesn’t always recognize. And I feel like you have to tune yourself like a radio to get in line with Gods love and direction to feel that satisfaction of feeling like your life finally means something. The Bible says there’s a war between good and evil going on rn and I think that speaks to that other dimension.
Also don’t get down about your past mistakes, I’ve done a few bad things in my time they haunt me so much but God forgives and makes u clean like it never even happened in his mind it’s just evilness that makes u remember and think that you’re trash and worthless. 
Anyways good luck man 
@_date: 2018-05-08 01:47:25
So if you have $100 of bitcoin and want to cash out 100%. You hit sell, &amp; someone else will be buying it from u on their coinbase, so coinbase just facilitates that trade and takes a small fee for doing so. 
When u hit sell you choose what u sell too, usd wallet or your bank account (if u have it linked up) 
I’m not the absolute best expert but even if there wasn’t another person on the other side buying coinbase would be the one buying from your sell and then they’d just sell whenever someone else is buying. Edit: but I think that never really happems

TA In General is about playing your odds and constantly adjusting. But what I mean is that it’s really easy to see when a pennant has formed on a chart with lowers highs and higher lows. When you start to get towards the tip of the pennant, (buy in at a dip when it starts to rise off the bottom) &amp; towards the top if volume picks up and you have a bullish break through, hold and gain, and if volume drops you’ll wanna sell and watch if it has a bearish break. But over all if you’re looking large scale like months especially since we’re about a month past the last crash crypto in general is bullish. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 13:37:03
I don’t trade because it demands your time, but if you just want to swing trade that’s quite possible. But In general if I was you I’d just get in a good position that u like and wait for a bull run and then sell near the top if u can. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 17:42:36
people have said that but I don’t understand why a small business would want to hold onto it and risk losing value instead of using the money to put back into the business. Especially since suppliers probably don’t accept it. In the future I don’t doubt that usd will be obsolete but I’d think it takes baby steps and just accepting crypto to begin with seems like a good start.

I want to help my uncle be able to set his brick and mortar store front up to accept bitcoin, how do I do it ? 
(Hypothetical) can anyone point me in the right direction for set ups, videos, where to purchase little scanned bois, anything related, YouTube videos, anything. I want to learn how people do it cuz if crypto booms this summer I want to start a business called lucky lemons where it’ll be like a Chick-fil-A except it’s just the lemonade and possibly toasted meat and cheese sandwiches.
My other uncle (reality) is running a “factoring receivables” business working with small businesses to pay them money owed to them in xx days - right now, around 95% of it,  (so they can use it to grow now and make more), in exchange for their receivable, 100% of  it.  I can’t think of a way to work crypto into this especially since smart contracts aren’t prevalent at all yet. But I know Reddit is a host to very smart folks.
Thank you to any who reply.
@_date: 2018-05-15 15:07:24
Well In reply to the last part of your comment; I would think a small business is just focused on capturing revenue from the money just sitting in bitcoin and is less interested in being a pizza shop and investment place holding bitcoin when it could take that profit and put it into growing the business.

@_date: 2018-05-15 17:29:01
Well I see your point but I think people with bitcoin would choose the bitcoin pizza store over the non even if their pizza is to a small degree not as good or as good of a value, so it’s attractive for a business to accept it as payment because it’s a marketing tool. Also visa takes a small but good percent out of their profit so accepting btc would help them generate more profit that way too. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 14:04:19
How did you set yourself up? BitPay ? Can you explain it all out ?
@_date: 2018-05-08 01:38:39
It definitely is but if you aren’t putting in a lot then spending $50 on a hardware wallet might not be worth it. Some people only put in $100 and that’s ok. 
If u just wanna keep a small amount then put it in the coinbase wallet vault, with 2fa for ur account and email, with very strong passwords 
@_date: 2018-05-15 14:20:45
No idea honestly but they use your account for I guess bots so their bots have credibility through karma and account age. My good friend told me about it and I pass that onto you but I do not know where to find a buyer

It’ll happen before you know it. If you are planning to hold long long term go ahead and sell now at a loss so you can say you lost money for this current tax year and use that to pay less tax and then in over a year from now if u sell you’ll be able to get a tax discount for long term hold. 
But really June Id say we start taking off again 
@_date: 2018-05-16 05:50:20
As I said in other replies to this post I would think that a small business just wants to focus on the business and would accept bitcoin because it saves them money vs visa’s cut when people use cards. They can’t use the bitcoin to purchase supplies or pay employees. And they want to accept it to entice people that otherwise wouldn’t go there because crypto people like to support crypto businesses. In my mind it seems useless for a small business to hold onto them because of the risk of losing money. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 13:50:10
Yes and karma means more money as well but even if u had a lot your account prolly wouldn’t sell for more than $25 I’d say. It’s not like those types of sites give u a great deal, it’s like a yard sale price 
@_date: 2018-05-10 16:59:40

Every time I get into a deep talk with someone about bitcoin and they're not invested they usually get to the part where "what if someone shut the internet down or shot a bomb that wiped out our power grid"
And you can easily argue that if that happened money wouldn't matter. 
But I feel like the more every country gets on board with this the more connected we all our Economically. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:54:40

Chances for a pull back, in my mind, are very low. 
What caused the recent pull back??... the fear over the impending split...
And So i ask myself do we have anything remotely close to that coming up, ever..? Doubt it. Only thing I see that could cause another major pull back is an exchange getting hacked. 
I know the cycles of bitcoin but I don't think we're Likely to see it go down to 3k again. 
I think btc will go to to 5k drop to 4.3k and then from there much higher with smaller and smaller drops. That's just my thoughts on it. I'd just continue to dollar cost avg.

Anyone see any sell walls ? Or will it push hard and fast after 10k cuz I could see that. 10k in my mind is a fomo type of psychological line

Take some time off and work a job to buy more btc, focus on teaching urself things or whatever. I was a junior studying engineering, I dropped out and I’ve made a lot of money from investing in crypto. 
I’m happy with how much I have in and now I’m going back to school! (Although I’m changing to a major I enjoy)
Prioritize your life! If you think this is all so important then act on it, let people call u foolish now, those same people may be calling u wise in 3 years. What if bitcoin really does go to 100,000+ 
What if it does? Will u regret not focusing on building ur investment position?
What if it doesn’t? Will u still regret your decision? 
Life isn’t a rush but I feel a rushed when it comes to investing in this revolution

If they just give the coins to people that should have it they’ll prolly sell them. 
But if they make it available to purchase the price could go up, a lot of people are mines and only use coinbase and so if they have the option there they could get into it. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:47:17
Maybe u accidentally set it to buy on a time period like weekly or something like that and you will have actually bought another 1k 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:14:02
Prolly so, 10k is a huge psychological mark, but it could be the kind of mark that spurs on a larger price
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:25:11
Oh ok I was never sure about that.

This is monopoly internet money that’s the thing. 
The game monopoly only works when the players believe in the money.
The usd only works because people believe in it. 
The more people believe in bitcoin the less they’ll believe in the usd and the more businesses and people will flock to btc.

And that big market cap going up, new money coming in! We’re all growing!!

I thought we’d go lower for a last 5th wave but good news for btc and stuff, seems logical. It’s been 3 months since the btc ath. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 05:49:42
Can you explain what ur talking about ?
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:27:39
I’m not sure this is my first time doing my taxes. You mentioned 1031, I assume that’s some sort of form. Is there a certain form you have to file for when you do cash out back into fiat?  Or do I just basically go on turbo tax and say hey I invested this much and this is how much I’ve cashed out. 
As I’m thinking about this My mind is blown wondering how I’ll calculate all these things with trades going every which way on multiple exchanges and using shapeshift and stuff, 
And I’m confused because say I bought 1 eth to start and sold 1 eth worth back into usd and that eth I sold is worth double my initial investment so I’d pay on that but then now I’ve traded and own more than one eth so at if I cashed out more then idk 
I’ve spent three years studying engineering and I don’t know how anyone is figuring all of this stuff out especially people like me that were nubes a year ago cashing in and out and trading left and right not even aware of how these taxes will work out. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 14:22:31

@_date: 2018-03-24 05:59:02
Oh man I’m in the same boat I’ve been stressing since I have like 95% of everything in crypto. So you’re telling me I won’t be taxed for crypto to crypto for 2017?

What would one have to file if a person bought btc traded around and had some money that they cashed out?

No I’m saying that I think we’re going to have an economic crash in the near future that hurts people enough that they are open to bitcoin. You’re 100% right people are sheep, I think a good example in America is the patriot act after 9/11. That’s something that hurt America and made the people vulnerable To change but that change that comes after an economic hurt could be bitcoin imo

Oh yea I just use them interchangeably 
@_date: 2018-04-20 02:30:12
They can regulate exchanges that are centralized. But look at China, if u want to buy crypto badly enough you can. And I think that even in places like Canada if u want to go on bitfinex you can use a vpn to get on. 
But no they can’t regulate bitcoin’s blockchain because its decentralized. 
Im not super technically learned but I’d say I’m fairly accurate with this comment.

If you go through coinbase, somewhere in there they are teamed up with a debit card that u can use to spend btc on ur coinbase account just like you would use a normal debit card 
@_date: 2017-07-18 23:19:35
A lot of people think they are just fooling us to raise the price then pull out 
@_date: 2017-07-13 11:25:12
Yep coinbase, I believe that they are insured, in the way that if they are hacked but if u personally are hacked it's ur fault. 
I buy on coinbase and send to my ledger nano s wallet. 
For some obscure alt coins I haven't figured the best way to keep them so they're sitting on buttress exchange 
A tip for new people: don't use poloniex 
@_date: 2017-07-08 23:32:57

Come on man, it's decentralization, everyone in bitcoin should be a fan of that. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:38:11
Of course it's an insane that it's 2017 and we're still using paper money. We use credit and debit cards left and right, paychecks are sent straight to the bank. It's almost all online anyways.
The next logical stop is a digital currency for each nation.
The next logical stop after that is a world wide digital currency.
In both scenarios bitcoin plays a large role. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 13:59:47

Hope it turns out to be a good move!
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:04:53
Same 
 I got in between $85 and $150 on eth
Big learning curve 
If ur not holding 
I finally grew up and put most of it into btc
Left a touch in eth ltc and about 5% in things like stratis etc

Eos to my knowledge isn't even released yet. I think that's why people say it's a scam. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 23:00:33
Not what I'm doing, I'm thinking of it as more of a mild IT type thing, like how people have someone help them set up their internet and tv.
I can help people use crypto. 
More of a teach a man to fish scenario instead of giving him a fish, I really want to see the crypto world grow and go mainstream and I think this is a great way to bridge the gap between knowledgeable and interested but not knowledgeable and i know people are interested but getting familiar with it all is scary so I want to help people overcome those initial hurdles

@_date: 2017-07-10 20:44:34
I keep mine on the nano s 
But isn't coinbase insured?
Also how do people go about storing less popular shit coins like reddcoin 
@_date: 2017-07-07 22:07:11
I think I would, there's a lot of anxiety if you care too much, which i do
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:07:38
Guys is this foreal?

@_date: 2017-07-06 20:45:18
I'm thinking about doing $30 for me to come over to someone's house and help them with as much as they need.
Or a FaceTime for long distance people. 
I was also considering Doing like a club where I can help people multiples times and they just pay a monthly fee of like $15
At this point my time isn't worth a whole bunch. 
I've been offering and mildly helping all friends and family for free to get them excited and encourage them to pass my name along through word of mouth.
