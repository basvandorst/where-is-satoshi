I created a docker container to run my node. I have documented the steps here

rpi4 is arm64 based. so you will need to download the arm package.
Try this:
wget 
tar xzvf bitcoin-0.18.1-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz
mv bitcoin-0.18.1/bin/* /usr/local/bin/
Assuming you are running as user pi, bitcoin.conf should be in following location /home/pi/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
I used a predefined config generated for Raspberry Pi here  changed the datadir to my hdd and dbcache to 2500

Thanks. i was under the impression that verification was the least expensive operation. Didn't think it would be this slow on a pi 4gb model. I need to try this on my main machine just to compare the speed.

I,ll lower my time preference.. :)

Thanks. very helpful.
I have a 4GB model. increased dbcache value from 100 to 2500
@_date: 2019-10-31 14:01:40
thanks. dbcache was set as 100 mb. just changed it to 2500. i have an rpi 4GB model.

Blockchains are slow and inefficient compared to traditional databases. 
If its for private use, there are better distributed technologies out there that are a lot faster and scale better.

Whats the point? Why dont they use a Distributed/Shared Database instead?

I think not at all a good thing in the long run.
I think a lot of people think that govt is stupid and they don't understand bitcoin. They cant ban bitcoin. They cant control it. Guess what!! they already know that. They are not going to ban it instead control the price of bitcoin. just like the precious metals gold, silver etc.
When they feel the need to control the price of bitcoin, they would give their approvals for ETF. They would also allow all kinds of derivative and insurance products on top of it.
Price discovery of bitcoin would soon move to some major exchange.  all the other exchanges that we have now would follow them. (Those who do not toe their line gets shutdown citing money laundering , drug dealing etc)
Now the government has the infrastructure to start controlling the price.  they would slowly start bringing the price of bitcoin down by naked shorting. turning off most people who have invested. same thing happening with gold. bitcoins chart would be similar to that of gold within few years after govt approves an ETF.

that would have created alternate versions of the blockchain that would continue alongside the original. he would have to travel back in time again and do a 51% attack to rectify the timeline. :)
