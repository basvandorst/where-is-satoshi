I will send you a crate of coffee. Now I just need to find a bulk coffee seller who will take this worthless Tron off me.

On top of what others have said I'll say they made some changes to BTC that are helpful temporarily by increasing block size they lowered fees but in the long run this isn't sustainable and will eventually suffer from the same issues BTC has now. If they wanted to really make it more usable in a daily basis they would have made the changes litecoin did.

Youre telling me you aren't using your AltaVista tool bar anymore?

Eventually as we get more and more transactions down the road the new block size will become full again. This will trigger another block size increase and this will keep happening until we are sending more and more data.  I can't find it now but I read that bCash is testing a theoretical limit to the block size and they have found there is a max size due to data transfer limitations. That might be far in the future and maybe there is a better tech that will solve this. On the flip side lightning and segwit are helping BTC.  
  
I think the argument really comes down to store of wealth vs a means of everyday payment. BTC and bCash are really a better as a store of value. IMO if bCash wanted to be an everyday payment it would have followed the litecoin model (faster blocks).  With BTC or bCash if you are buying coffee you need to stand at the register for 10min until your transaction goes through which is unreasonable. Even the 2.5min of LTC is too long. That's where an IOTA, XLM, or the like will come in to be the everyday payment method and these will be backed by something like BTC.  In this model BTC won't need as many transactions but be a secure source of wealth.
