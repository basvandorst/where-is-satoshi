Ok that makes so much more sense, so how can this affect the price of physical Bitcoin? Will banks deliberately sell off massive amounts of physical bitcoins to short the futures?

I've been telling people for a year now, no one listened to me, the second bitcoin broke 10k my phone wouldn't stop ringing, people telling me they don't have the money, now wanna buy in! Like it wasn't believable at 800-1200 but at 10k it was????? My brother bitched he had no money a yr ago now wants to pull money outta his police pension to buy, I'm like dude u coulda bought 10 Bitcoin with 10 grand now u could get 0.6 of a Bitcoin, I just don't get it! I think coins like litecoin will flourish cause now bitcoin is outa reach for so many! It is kinda fun telling everyone I told you so! Lol

Buy bitcoin first from an exchange like coinbase, if u link a bank account it take like 7 businesses days, if u use a credit card it's instant but the fees are way higher, then u join another exchange that deals in alts like bittrex, u then send your bitcoin to the exchange then u can buy other cryptos!

It's just an app, if it's a legitimate CC why not!

Of course you probably watch CNN������ project veritas literally was talking to the NYC commissioner of board of elections Allen Shulkin, google it, he's a democrat and says on undercover camera how the Dems bus inner city trash around from county to county for multiple votes, over and over again, for free lunch and a little money! Why do u think Dems don't want voter ID laws??? Think about it you need ID to do anything in this country!

The smartest thing I ever did was sell my silver and gold, and bought Bitcoin! I got in last year and more than 5x my investment, silver hasn't barely moved at all in 6 yrs! So scrap the silver and buy crypto!
