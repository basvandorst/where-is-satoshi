I didn't realize this was a video and not a gif. When I first watched it there was no sound. I figured it was some sort of test in a private instance and not a live purchase from an online store.

Thanks for sharing that. It makes me even more excited for bitcoin's future. I just invested all the bitcoin I got right away with a card in other currencies. I feel so naked now with 0 bitcoin even though it's just been a day. I'll buy some more the next time it dips below 15k.

Thanks! That was very informative and got me on the hype train.

I didn't know about forced hodl. I've been trying desperately over the last 2 days to buy my first cryptocurrency but ran into a comedy of slowdowns. I just got my ID renewed so hopefully I can buy it shortly. That is if the verification ever finishes.

I'll buy there too. But in the meantime i'm getting some serious FOMO seeing it rise. I wanted to get it around 15.1k but I know I should stick to playing the waiting game. It'll for sure fluctuate at some point back down to 13-14k. I should really wait until then and ignore the fear of this whole futures thing making bitcoin skyrocket.

I just got into cryptocurrency and that's my exact mindset. If I ever get 10x+ my investment, I might cash out what I put in. That way if it ever crashes hard I can at least take solace in the fact that I didn't lose anything. I think it's important to not look at it as missing out on money for not selling at a certain point (e.g. 19,000) because there's no way of knowing at the time that that would be the peak. You can't beat yourself up over buying too high or selling too low. It'll drive ya crazy.

I'm honestly terrified of it but I feel like I need to jump in. I just want to buy some and hodl.

Can someone please explain to me the significance of this?
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:58:25
That's for the explanation! I'm going to do some research on it now. I want to know if when it's coming out, what crypto it works on, do I have to buy anything like a trezor for it, etc.

It's driving me mad. It's gone up over $4000 since I've decided to try to purchase it. I gotta stop obsessively checking it.
