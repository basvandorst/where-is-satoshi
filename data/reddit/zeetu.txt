I don't know if it's ready yet but ZeroNet might be able to do multisig on site updates.

I hope they have bitcoin QR codes on their little boxes they carry around.

More importantly they can cut down on charge backs which is good for them AND it prevents auto recurring billing which is rampant in that industry. Good for the consumer!

I've been a chase customer for years and had no problem wiring bitstamp. I even met with my banker and they thought it was cool and made sure it got pushed through. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:39:06
Got my free coins but unable to send them out. Says problem sending coins...

Sure, I like airbitz because you are in control of your private keys. The devs have stated that their entire architecture is setup to assume a breach and still not allow theft. They have a solid whitepaper here if you want more in depth info: 
Personally the wallet just does a good job and I like that I can log transactions with notes, etc.
@_date: 2016-07-29 21:51:16
I'd recommend AirBitz

For that, I would honestly use Gyft to get amazon gift cards and buy there.

Im not a tax professional but this should be considered cash as far as Payroll is concerned. You should be able to input the extra bonus as cash dollars (value at time you gave it) into your payroll system and it will do your taxes.

Do a task for someone and ask to be paid in BTC
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:52:49
This is huge news. I've already passed it along to my friends that run shops and you should too! 
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:48:43
Yeah it can take up to 48 hours without a fee. You could take this to another level and have everyone buy in with 15 bucks worth and play for keeps! 
I'm going to see if I can get some people together for this in San Diego. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:23:58
Convenience. Coinbase takes 5-7 days to get your coins and most other exchanges require a high price international wire transfer. Most people on localbitcoins charge a 5-10% markup as well.
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:02:47
Looks down for me too :( Crashed JUST as I was playing and cashed out most of my coins.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:57:46
I own a Tesla, Red 85 KWh (6200 miles, San Diego) that I would be willing to sell for BTC.

Check out Bitstamp.net, they seem the most stable.
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:29:16
Mind sharing the e-mail instructions you plan to send out?
@_date: 2013-11-09 07:08:33
Also check out trybtc.com
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:57:58
Localbitcoins.com for in person.
Coinbase.com if you are in the US.
Referral link: 
Gyft.com to convert them into giftcards for stores.

I would take a look at

This sounds common for new buyers. I have placed dozens of transactions fine. Did you fully verify your account? 
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:49:45
Maybe. OP, was this your first purchase and did you do the full verification with SSN? I haven't had any reversals as I did the SSN verification first.

Coffee and Art in downtown.

@_date: 2013-11-09 03:24:30
Is this your first purchase?
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:56:19
Nope. When you buy the card through Gfty, their payment provider, Bitpay turns it into USD for them immediately by selling it on an exchange to another bitcoin user.

I'd let it go for 135BTC
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:06:34
Cool idea but you need to figure the fees which are about 2 cents right now. 
Since its all for fun, I wonder if you could just make transactions without a fee. Can you send out an unconfirmed bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-11-11 14:35:31
Coinbase has automatic recurring payments as well. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:36:39
Try 
Some sellers will take small amounts via PayPal.
@_date: 2013-11-12 23:24:50
Here is a big list of places accepting BTC: 
You can also look at HumbleBundle.com for games. Coingig.com for products and Coinmap.org for retailers they accept them.
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:20:42
I just bought 0.5 BTC with this method and it's awesome! Great work Coinbase!
@_date: 2013-11-12 23:28:10
The OP wanted to avoid paying taxes on his earnings, which he would be liable for if he used BTC to purchase things or exchanged them back into fiat currency. My earlier response was a bit confusing :)
@_date: 2013-11-13 03:15:16
I would recommend showing them trybtc.com
It will walk them through how it works and give them 3-4 cents for free.
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:43:31
Up to 1 BTC weekly.
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:39:34
Its back!
@_date: 2013-11-09 07:04:03
They may be overloaded. Try contacting support. I heard they can honor the original purchase price too sometimes if you ask.

As someone that goes to San Francisco often, this coffee is one of my favorites:

Regardless of where you store your coins. You are required to report earnings on them to the IRS or you are evading taxes.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:44:10
Yeah I thought this was pretty dumb as well.

Spent some time today putting this emblem together so every time I kill someone, they see the bitcoin logo!

You are buying GH/s from other users. Basically, it makes the market for GH/s more liquid so instead of investing money in a physical miner that would takes weeks to receive you can start mining right away and then sell whenever you want.
You can even set a sell order and it will continue mining until its actually sold.
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:23:59
I get a PS4 on Friday from Amazon that I may be willing to let go of for BTC.
