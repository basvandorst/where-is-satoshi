I think you're vastly misunderstanding. I don't care either way about who deserves what, or the risk factors involved...
I mean the mentality of 'beating the government and making investors rich' it's not the gola of the currency to make people rich... the goal of the currency isn't to rise in value, but many people are treating it as it that's an intended side effect of this thing. Or somehow doing this is attacking the government or something.
It makes no sense, people are making this into something it isn't. You are in an investment of a type, that's all. It's not like some sort of cultural movement liberating the masses.

Well, That's what I was was thinking of. They bought it at today's prices, and today's Hashrates, but that is a lot of cost, for a lot of risk. 
The smart thing for them to do is turn their risk into assured cash, while an individual may want to turn their cash into risk assuming investment.  
They can use your cash now to stablize financially, and to expand, and they avoid the risk that new developments will dwarf their Hashrate. You assume that risk for them in exchange for the possibility of outmining the cost.
That's why I wanted to see if there was say, 1 month contracts, so I can avoid the technology risk. 
Honestly what you describe is actually how most companies work....why would Google IPO its shares for $100 10 years ago? It could have stayed private and gotten 1150 for them today. It needed money to finance that growth.
It possible for both the renter and rentee to benefit from the deal.

I just dont understand how 'legit' and 'pays you your money' are two different things to you... You honestly believe they can't do anything? You believe that their bank limits their number of transactions? lol

Ok, why not though?

Ok, so here you're paying in BTC for essentially the mining rights, andvyou can turn around and sell those mining rights back to someone else for whatever the market rate would be later on...and they make payments out to you based on your shares in the mining of a block or whatever?
Basically I've got some BTC, and I'm not doing anything with it so figure I mgiht as well like do something, so if I can spend it to mine more and stuff, that sounds fun.
We're talking amounts that I consider play money, I think this BTC could just be a fun side hobby and something to track.

I guess its such a foolish and naive answer, its amazing they've stolen from so many people and you still trust them

'Because the biggest market trading the thing is a total fucking scam' isn't a great reason

How is any money still there?

Even if that's true...do they not let anyone withdraw in any currency? every currency should be able to correct the arbitrage

How are they legit if they refuse to pay people for weeks at a time...or at all in many cases?
@_date: 2014-01-21 08:07:36
I was listening, yes.
That wasn't a rhetorical question...do you legitimately believe that banks in multiple countries are limiting Mt Gox to a certain number of transactions per day?
And they cannot find other methods of paying out funds?

Isn't this headline itself a sign of a problem? 
Is a currency supposed to be making people rich? Isn't it a bit weird that it is?
