In order to be completely done with bitcoins you must purge your self of all bitcoin related materials, that includes further bitcoins, my child.
Go ahead and PM me, and we'll just get them set up on my wallet. 
I'm just kidding you dark, and edgy hipster. Drop the playful roller coaster habit if desired, but I personally enjoy playing with them. The actual fear I get when every thing is crashing is nothing compared to the rush I receive if I see them sky rocket.

Fuck I sold my BTC to buy more BTC :S 
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:48:41

I'll use the bitcoin to buy some Christmas presents for a very poor family I know.
