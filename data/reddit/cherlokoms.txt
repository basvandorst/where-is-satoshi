Do we have any information of when NL becomes production ready? Who should I follow to have the information?
Additionnaly, how can I contribute by creating a node? Will it work like masternodes in other cryptos (owner takes a part of the fees)? I'll create one anyway!

When mainstream medias put out misleading and biased informations on topic I know about, it makes me think of the enormous amount of crap they are feeding me on topics I know less about...

I see a lot of comments speaking about the right to free speech being denied. It's not. The government is not censoring him. What happen is that he is being denied money by privates companies. Companies have a right to say "We don't want to be associated with this guy's bullshits, it's bad for our brand image so we kick him out."
Free speech means that the government can't put you in jail because of what you say. It doesn't mean that the rest of us has to cope with his bullshit or give him the right to get money for it.

No one mines bitcoin with GPU.

Do you get a chance to mine something with USB Block Erupters?  How well does it perform compared to other ASICs?

That's a good thing. You don't get mass adoption by shoving ads at people's face furthermore when it's ads leading to scams (i.e. the vast majority of crypto ads).

Here is a thing I'm gonna do: everyday I will tweet "The price will raise" and "The price will drop". Then I will delete whichever tweet is wrong. I'm gonna be a hell of a trader.

The worst thing about TAs is that when you want details on how bitcoin works and type "bitcoin technical details" on Youtube, you end up with a bunch of idiots having an opinion about what the price is gonna be.
@_date: 2018-04-10 10:09:48
This is exactly true. Traders learn and teach the same patterns. The limited amount of bots on the market implement those patterns. Even if the pattern doesn't mean jack shit, the price is still gonna rise because these bots and traders are going to think it does.
