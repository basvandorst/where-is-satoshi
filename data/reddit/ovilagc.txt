Google ihome mini makes you “speak to satoshi” when you ask about crypto and when you are “speaking to satoshi” you can ask about all sorts of cryptos, no joke!

Please explain to me the similarities between a flower that grows easily in the wild and can be destroyed very easily ... and a cryptographic chunk of data that can’t be easily created, can’t be duplicated, can’t be changed or altered and can’t be spend twice AND is extremely scarce ..

I will literally bet with you. Put you’re money where your mouth is if your so sure, i’ll bet with any crypto. If bitcoin dies (under 50b market cap?) i’ll give you 100$ of any crypto you want and same for you if it goes back over 15k for more than 2 weeks. Sound fair? Let’s go

Just so you know... Texas as a state can’t do shit to bitconnect lol they have a few hundred maybe thousand users in texas and hundreds of thousands around the world, this will do nothing except scare potential investors in texas. P.S. I’m not in bitconnect, I just know how these things work. For them to shut down they would have to get cease and desists in their biggest producing countries which won’t happen.
Edit: a word

I’ll do it with fiat. It’s printed at the rate of 560 million $ per day so I can’t see how it’s superior but hey to each their own I suppose. You’ll understand the value one day, I couldn’t care less lol. Bet’s on �� the internet is watching now mitch. 100$ to the winner (paypal)

Crazy to think then when it hits 15,750 it’ll be 20,000$ Canadian dollars, for me that’s huge

 Almost did this when it was at 18k USD, my profit was just over 20k CAD (bought at 6,600$) would have cleared my student loan... BUT I DIDN’T. And i’m glad :) did that ever take some will power...
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:37:38
I got 1 btc roughly 3 weeks ago at 6,600, fastest return i’ve ever made on an investment ! In my good ol canadian $ thats 8 grand profit I think. Never gonna sell though so screw the profits 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:27:07
yea was totally wrong on that one. I LOVE BEING WRONG :D
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:40:53
Yea, it’s great to love bitcoin and everything but day trading is a COMPLETELY different ball game and unless you’re a master trader your odds of that are unimaginable, not conservative at all imo. Even if you had paper traded bitcoin successfully and got a good return on paper, it still isn’t close to what you would have actually made because the biggest factor is still absent and that is emotion... good luck though, never sell your btc my friend.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:18:57
PSA: There is a huge wall of sells at 12k, it will most likely instantly dip back down for a short period, then rise again.

this made me laugh
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:14:49
But what if it hits 20k while you’re cleaning, then you’ll never have the coinbase screenshot? You’ll never be able to say “I remember when I saw it hit 20k”. 
You can’t leave and you know it.

@_date: 2017-11-30 00:54:18
I suppose, but if coinbase is lets say 5% and you'll pay 8% on localbitcoins (usually I pay roughly 7% on there) but it is instant and simple plus never have to use tax ID no matter what. I think it's worth the extra couple bucks specially since most people only buy for a grand or two on here, not even

The Fed is a pyramid that uses fractional reserve banking to keep the whole gov and taxpayers in dept until infinity controlling every country one by one, so, research a little, and you'll see who's building a pyramid real quick. Bitcoin is like internet. Decentralized, sure some people own a lot, doesn't mean they profit off of my buying and selling and using the coin as currency. Also, you can still buy bitcoin and it's still a great time to invest so don't be sour for missing out. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:15:36
Okay yes GDAX would probably suit me better than coinbase anyway 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:25:27
how does the IRS even know if you own bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:19:24
Another way is to go to the stocks app on your phone and look up btcusd
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:22:35
That's not a pyramid, that's a pie where someone has a bigger piece, pyramid is when money flows upwards, I owe NO MONEY to any of the biggest bitcoin names, they don't collect my funds in any way. Like early buyers of apple, they just have more because they saw opportunity earlier on. Also, can you show me the sources that show a few people own 99% of bitcoins please. I'm curious. I was told satoshi was the one that owned the most and it was rumored to be at 1m bitcoin, out of 16m so still not close. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:18:27
Lots of people already are. Specially outside of the US. But you can google list of stores that accept bitcoins, gets bigger everyday

DONT BUY A ROLEX. You're 16, you don't need that, invest more and get a house by 19 THEN you'll impress them. Showing off actually makes people like you less, contrary to popular belief.

Hey man I love you, keep doing what you’re doing. The time where you were bombarded with donations was one of my happiest days ever!! Made me so happy knowing you were financially rewarded (even though I know you don’t care) for the insane amount of good content and knowledge you bring the blockchain community. You make things easy (ish) to understand and that’s worth something! Keep it up

that was awesome
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:50:13
I don’t see how that’s the same but wtv, all good man. It does suck for those who bought at ATH but it serves as a lesson learned I suppose. Never buy at all time high it’s like investing 101 imo. There are a lot of people who bought in the last 2-3 months but not nearly as much as the last 10 years combined. I’d say the majority of btc holders are in profit

Using the exact name of the parent and then calling the parent something other than what it used to be called is a different story though.

The US robbed citizens of buying power as well, just not to the same extent.
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:19:57
Inflation isn’t necessary to that extent. I won’t argue with you though, if you believe the fed printing $560,000,000 per day is healthy that’s cool. I personally don’t but wtv
