There is lots of great work being done to develop the Lightning Network, and beta testing of it is going very well. However, we have seen how the ecosystem reacts to optional upgrades such as SegWit - adoption doesn't exactly happen very fast.
I'd say the groundwork needed to implement LN should be released by next year, but I have no clue when we will start seeing wide-scale adoption of LN. If it works as well as it is intended to, and it allows fees to be dropped in a secure manner, then I'm sure that would speed up adoption by exchanges and wallets.

That's a rather interesting question. I have personally interacted with hedge fund managers who believe BTC is going to hit $100k soon, and have also interacted with managers who think BTC is a Ponzi scheme. The answer to this question is one I am unable to give you - only the future can.
But, it will be interesting to see what happens. I wonder who will win - the power of massive hedge funds shorting, or the frenzied buying of soccer dads and stay-at-home moms on Coinbase?

This is absolutely possible. However, it is extremely rare - this normally only happens with zero fee transactions. Usually, even if it takes days, the transaction always gets through. For "fraud" to occur, the scammer would need to use RBF, which is a lengthy process. It would be wise for a restaurant to set a minimum fee policy, if accepting BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:37:15


Good question. The thing is, the fee you pay is not at all related to the amount you are sending. Confirming a $500 transaction and a $5mm transaction takes the same effort for a miner - it depends on the number of inputs your transaction contains.
Incentivizing miners with 1% of the transaction amount would fuck everything up. Miners would process big, big transactions, and nobody would touch a transaction under 10 BTC. The current system makes sure everyone is included, from small players to big whales.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:14:13

It's possible that the wallet you use is deducting 0.01 BTC for fees. PM me and I will help you out further; screenshots would be handy.

It is plausible. But remember - if everyone says it's about to happen, it probably won't. At least, in Bitcoin, that is.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:48:19
The BTC blocksize could be increased to 8MB, or 100MB, but it is being kept at 1MB. This is primarily for the reason you gave - since every transaction is recorded, if we increased the blocksize too much, the blockchain would become far too large for small nodes to process - leading to increased centralization. Off-chain solutions such as the Lightning Network are being developed to remedy this.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:58:17
The fee they charged you is pure profit. In addition to this, they may have a spread (the difference between the price they charge you and the price at which their liquidity providers supply them with BTC).
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:30:03
Long story, I'm sure you can Google it and found out more. In short, people run programs on their computer that solve hashes for the Bitcoin network, and the algorithm pays them small amounts of BTC as a reward for using up their hashpower.

Sorry for your loss.
There was a point, when BTC was much cheaper, where I lost 130 BTC. I also sold well over 50 BTC at $1 each. The simple truth is, life has a chosen course which you cannot change for the most part. You simply react to situations in a certain way which cannot be undone. He could've never seen the future, that's just how life is.

When creating a paper wallet, the service you use gives you both your private key and your public key. You are to note down both, and to keep your private key safe and secure.
A question I once asked myself: how do I know this service is not going to steal my coins? They did make the private key, after all.
The solution is quite simple. First, find a service you like (I love [BitAddress]( Next, download the webpage (right click and save), and then turn off your device's WiFi connection. You can then open the saved file in your browser, generate the public/private key, and delete the file. You have now created a brand new paper wallet in an offline environment - easy peasy!
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:45:20
In my wallet, that's for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:51:19
What you are currently doing is breaking the Coinbase Terms of Service! Enjoy it while it lasts. Go ahead and read the terms you agreed to - you are not allowed to do that, and if they find out, you're screwed. It's okay, I won't rat you out ;)

Yeah, so Wall Street and such will be able to trade Bitcoin. They may go mega long or mega short. It will certainly affect the price, both the expectation of the event and the event itself, but we cannot know what exactly will happen until it does.

Refrain from using Coinbase if possible, especially in times of network congestion like this. While it can be great for new users, it does not allow one to set custom fees, which can be a pain in the ass sometimes.

If the SHA-256 algorithms Bitcoin uses get cracked, then Bitcoin is screwed for the short-term. However, updates would be pushed out soon to remedy this, with new encryption formats. Quantum computing is a long way away, and I'm sure the encryption algorithm would be updated well before we ever reach such advanced technology.

That's very true. To be quite honest, I don't care that I sold the hundreds of coins I used to have. I once read a great analogy on this sub - expressing regret that you sold your coins early is kind of like saying "oh, man, I wish I had last week's lottery numbers a month ago - could've been a millionaire!"

LN will make transactions cheaper and faster, if/when implemented. Adoption may be slow, but it will happen, and when it does... altcoins don't stand a chance against BTC.

The Coinbase Vault should be just fine - if I'm not mistaken, they don't hold the keys. However, I do think they make you wait a bit before you can withdraw, so a hardware wallet may be more pragmatic.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:37:25
Not a big deal, since these new tokens aren't of much market value. Additionally, inspecting the blockchain shows that most of the big players haven't cared to withdraw their forked tokens anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:19:44
You have a seed (a bunch of words) which you can keep in a location other than your wallet. If something happens to your wallet, then you can recover it using the seed. You own both items entirely. With an exchange, if it's down for a minute, or if it gets hacked, or if it suddenly requires verification, or if it suddenly imposes withdrawal limits - you're pretty much fucked.

Every address has a public key and a private key. Think of the public key as your bank account number, and the private key as the bank account password.
When you store your bitcoins on Coinbase, your coins belong to them. Coinbase will have something called a hot wallet, which stores a lot of coins, maybe thousands. Everyone's coins are jumbled up and put into one place. One private key and one public key for thousands of coins - none belong to the users, and all belong to Coinbase. Coinbases promises them that in the event that the users want them back, Coinbase shall oblige.
When you make a withdrawal, Coinbase sends the coins from their hot wallet into your wallet. Now, they sit in your address, and you control the private key. To unlock, use or spend those coins, you only need your key, and do not need the permission of a third party.

You will never lose your BTC in that way. It will either reach your wallet, or it will get timed out of the mempool and will appear back into the originating wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:03:13
Governments can control how money flows into and out of BTC, but once it's in BTC, it is out of their control. I think that's one major purpose of BTC's creation - to escape regulation, and become free. Will governments ever be entirely okay with BTC? Nope. Should they be? Perhaps.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:17:14


Not really possible, checksums are in place. The odds of that happening are extremely, extremely low.


Not necessarily, it is also bought because it is considered to be a store of value that appreciates in the long run.


Speculative investment isn't BTC's only use; there is a thriving economy underpinning Bitcoin at the moment.


Good point - Bitcoin may very well be in a bubble right now. Who knows?
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:25:27
Excellent question! There's really not much to dislike about Bitcoin itself - I do dislike certain things in the ecosystem. For example: the scammers (including certain exchanges), the shillers and pumpers that hype it up 24/7, and the exchanges that require a shit ton of verification.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:09:42
Use a block explorer to see whether your transaction is "unconfirmed" or not. One or more confirmations means it has been included in a block, and is officially out of the mempool! Huzzah!

@_date: 2017-12-09 00:30:53
That's a good idea, but simulating an entire ecosystem could be hard. Also, to secure this network you would need a ton of hashpower. But, there is a testnet that tries to serve a similar purpose
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:50:21
If you have the seed words, you can delete the app - you'll be good. Is it more secure than a TREZOR? No.
1) A TREZOR would be more resistant to the elements - it can likely survive fire/water damage better than a piece of paper.
2) A TREZOR still requires a pin to transfer out your coins, but if someone gets hold of your seed words, your coins are pretty much gone forever.
Other than that, there's not much of a difference.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:43:54
Not a real "cryptocurrency" per se but if banks adopt it properly, may become big.

Not at all. People would send $0.01 for a fee of $0.0001 over and over again, millions of times. But, with the current model, you would pay $2 to send $0.01, or $2 to send $1,000,000. Everyone is equal

This depends on the transaction backlog. If your fee is very low, think 1 sat/byte, it may take a few weeks to confirm. If it doesn't confirm, it will be kicked out of the mempool and returned to your wallet. As long as you're not in a rush, it's no problem :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:36:15
This depends on how big your transaction is in terms of inputs. Any fee above 1 satoshi/byte will almost certainly get confirmed within 2 weeks. Under normal circumstances, 30-60 sats/byte should do. Right now, fees are more like 300 sats/bytes, but this backlog should clear up soon.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:07:17

Centralization is a concern, yes, but I feel like the Core devs are doing a great job by keeping the blocksize low, for now. More and more people have begun to mine, and I feel like it's not as big of a problem as it could have been if the blocksize were increased (during the whole scaling debate). Having BTC split into two chains may not have been my idea of a good solution, but in hindsight, it's a great way to make sure everybody gets what they want.
Tether is basically a representation of the US dollar in crypto form, so you don't need to deal with banks and shit. I think it's a great idea, and it makes trading BTC/USD pretty easy if you don't want to have to go through elaborate verification processes. Whether it's a scam or not - I do not know, because I don't really see how it could be. Does Bitfinex back up Tether with real USD? I am not aware. But, as long as people do quick in 'n out trades between USDT and BTC, I don't see a major problem there. Just don't hold Tether for too long (in case the conspiracy theorists were right all along!)

Short-term: when the mempool clears up.
Long-term: LN requires adoption by major players and needs to be thoroughly tested before implementation. If it all works out, Bitcoin will be back in its prime - better and more efficient than any altcoin cryptoland has to offer.

You can choose to store your BTC on the exchange, or you can download a wallet and store it there. It is usually much safer to store it in your wallet, since there is no counterparty risk (an exchange being hacked, etc).
There are many types of wallets: online wallets (such as blockchain.info) and downloadable wallets like Electrum or Mycelium. The latter are usually safer, since you are entirely in control of your private keys, and are not dependant on the uptime of a private online service. If you have over a few thousand dollars in BTC, I would recommend investing in a hardware wallet (eg. TREZOR or Ledger Nano S) since these are the safest possible alternative for storing cryptocurrencies.
To sell your coins, you will need to send them back to an exchange (if you choose to do it online). Buying and selling on exchanges normally involves a small fee of under 1%, which varies from exchange to exchange. When sending money in and out of your wallet or the exchange, there is also a transaction fee involved. This fee depends on how congested the network is. If there is a lot of network traffic, the fee will be high, if there isn't, the fee will be low. If you're not in a hurry, you can choose to set a custom fee - the coins will take longer to arrive, but the amount you pay in fees will be negligible.
Hope that answers your questions!

The US dollar used to be backed by gold. It is now backed by the "full faith and credit of the United States government". If that's good enough for you, so be it!


You seem to be forgetting that there are millions/billions of dollars worth of hardware and computers working hard to secure the BTC network. An insane amount of electricity is used every day for this purpose, and there is a big economy thriving solely on BTC. That's a lot of material reality!

BTC mining is quite electricity intensive, but electricity (and hardware) are the only costs incurred to support the network. The *other* financial system (the banking system) requires *far* more energy, time and money. Also, if the electricity usage of the network ever becomes too crazy, we could always switch to a non-PoW algorithm. That's the beauty of consensus!

Cause BTC to fail? Probably a sudden break of the SHA-256 encryption algorithm by a group of rogue hackers, or a fatal flaw in the code. Not impossible, but insanely unlikely.
More likely, and will cause a possible price crash, but will not cause BTC to fail:
- Satoshi selling his coins
- Governments declaring war against BTC
- Fees rising to insane levels ($100+)

Absolutely not. I'm not a great coder, and I'm actually 15 years old, lmao. But, I do have an immense understanding of the cryptoworld and its nuances - I can determine how good/scammy a project is, what markets will do, and a lot of other stuff with just a cursory glance.
I am by no means exceptionally talented or unique - it's basically just familiarity and experience. Keep reading, keep browsing and keep learning. The more you read about crypto, the more will seep it, and eventually it'll be like second nature to you. To know more about the coding aspect, I recommend you check out the book "Mastering Bitcoin".

Timing the market is a fool's errand, especially for a novice. I'd suggest you either lump-sum buy, or dollar-cost average over time. You may get lucky trading, if even, but such luck tends to be short-lived.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:53:54
Basically, the chain is split off (using the original codebase and blockchain). If a fork happens on date X, then the two blockchains are identical up until X, and then they start to differ based on consensus rules.
Anyone can fork the chain, but for the fork to survive there must be some hashpower behind it to keep it propped up. Everyone who holds coins on the original chain now has coins on the forked chain as well. Let's say BTC is $10, and a fork occurs. Let's presume the market values the "forked" BTC at $2. What will most likely happen in the short run is that BTC drops to $8, making BTC + "forked" BTC = $10. As time progresses, these values will change based on market demand and supply.
Forks are done for a variety of reasons, including ideological differences, fun, or an easy way to distribute tokens for a new coin.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:16:30
I'm five years younger than you, and it's working out great! Yes, I highly recommend learning as much as you can about BTC and other decentralized systems, because in this sociopolitical environment, I believe such technologies will become the future.

I suggest reading "The Internet of Money" as a start.

I have not read a definite answer to this either, but it seems to be that the maximum time a transaction can stay in the mempool is 2 weeks. It should expire after that.

I've seen call Bitcoin "SegShit" or "CoreCoin" and the like. It's not appropriate since the coin is quite simply named Bitcoin. The point of Bitcoin is to be censorship resistant and open, and if you're going to bash another coin for borrowing the name, shame on you. But, if they deliberately try to cause confusion by misleading people, then *that* is a problem. Feel free to use Bcash or Bitcoin Cash, I'll stick to the *official* name (unless it starts to cause problems for new crypto enthusiasts).

The definition of futures:


It basically lets people speculate on what they *think* the price of BTC will be at a certain time in the future. If lots of people think it will go high and they bet on futures, then the spot price will be dragged up - and vice versa if people want to short.

That's a great question!
At first glance, Bitcoin does seem a lot like a pyramid scheme. People on promise moons and lambos and vast riches to whoever chucks in a couple bucks. But, that's the wrong point of reference to use - new members should first read the whitepaper, and look at what BTC is intended to be.
In a pyramid scheme, normally, the first members profit as new people join in. However, in BTC, if the price falls then everyone loses out, not just the new members. In this simple regard, it isn't a pyramid scheme. On top of that, you do not need to "cash out" to spend BTC - you can directly spend BTC on several markets. Certainly, many people treat BTC as a speculative investment, but there is a thriving economy underpinning Bitcoin and that is a fact that cannot be ignored.

How much is enough? That's up to you to decide :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:34:56
Two reasons.
1. Low volume (a market price of $30,000 per coin doesn't mean much if only a fraction of a coin was sold all day)
2. Arbing difficulty - if it was easy to arb, people would do it. For example, I planned to arb with a friend in India when the price was $700 here and $950 in India, but the moment money came into his account from the exchange, his account was frozen and investigated by the tax authorities. Coincidentally, I am flying out to Kolkata soon to take advantage of the higher price in India tomorrow :)

It should be fine to store $100 on Coinbase (it is insured), but be wary of other things. For example, if you send your BTC to a betting site, they will instantly ban your account. It is much safer to create your own wallet and send your coins there.

It's important to know that along with all the investment interest, Bitcoin does have many thousands of daily users who use it as a currency, including myself.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:47:59
Here's how I see it: your money's value is *guaranteed* to fall if you keep it in USD/EUR, but if you keep it in BTC, it is likely to go up.
Of course, it could crash horribly, and you may lose quite a bit. High risk, high reward. For BTC to go truly and completely mainstream as a currency, its volatility will need to go down considerably. If it manages to reach a higher price in a couple years, I am certain that its volatility will be far lower than it is now, making it a more viable currency for daily spending.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:38:11
Bitcoin code is open-source. The blockchain is a public ledger.
If the creator wanted to secretly make himself get rich, he would need to code it in. Other people who run nodes can see this code, so... it would be impossible. We can also see, via the blockchain, that the creator has not moved any of the coins from his known wallet.

Anyone can join the Core project. They are a team of talented developers with decades of combined coding experience. Every revision to the code is vetted before it is published as a new version of the Bitcoin Core client.
Now, once a new version is pushed out, it is not instantly applied to the Bitcoin network - that would be dangerous. Nodes - you guys, the public - choose whether or not they want to run the new software, and if people do, then the changes come into play. Pretty neat, eh?

Once you have BTC, then all middlemen are abolished. Unfortunately, to acquire BTC, you may have to get through an intermediary.


Yep. You can do it peer-to-peer, like on LBC, or you can buy goods/services.

@_date: 2017-12-08 12:43:17


This could be a potential problem - a slight crash could result in a cascade of panic sellers and margin calls. But, interestingly enough, each "crash" represents a change in ownership of the coins. They transition from weak hands to strong hands. As the rise-crash-rise-crash cycle ensues, the "hands" that hold BTC become stronger and stronger, and eventually, the whole cascade flash crash doesn't pose much of a problem anymore. History is proof of this - percentage-wise, crashes are far less severe now than before.


Bank buildings, offices, renting out spaces. All the computers, hardware, and electricity. Salaries for cashiers and cleaners, all the way up to the CEOs who bag millions annually. Tens of banks per country, tens of countries. If all that money being used on a financial system is viable, and a fraction of it being used on Bitcoin is not - I find that to be fallacious reasoning.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:32:18


I think you summarized it quite well!


Spending your coins require one to propagate a transaction onto the Bitcoin network. "Wallets" as services are merely GUIs that enable people to do this in a user-friendly manner. Many wallets are open source: they do not look at your private key. Basically, wallets make life easier, and you do not necessarily have to trust the makers of the wallet as long as the wallet is open-source - thus, your coins are entirely safe.


This is a suckish part of crypto right now. However, there are always alternatives. For example, many LBC sellers do not require ID verification. In addition, there are some new "physical" exchanges cropping up that deal in cash only! Let's hope this part evolves soon.


There is something known as an extended public key (xPub key) implemented by wallets such as Blockchain.info which allow you to create multiple public keys with the same wallet data. You can basically create as many public keys as you want and they will lead back to the same wallet. The downside is, if anyone discovers the private key to even one of your addresses, they will be able to access all coins associated with that xPub key. Remember, using xPub keys is free (there are no inter-wallet fees, since you are not constantly moving from one wallet to another).

Coinbase makes you wait, yes. But, luckily, they lock in the price at which you buy, so you're not shooting in the dark. You won't be paying the price it's at 5 days later!


A single confirmation on the Bitcoin network can take 10-20 minutes on average. In times of high network activity (such as now), this time is greatly increased - if you don't want to pay a super high fee, you'll need to wait. But, under normal circumstances, you should be fine.
What you could possibly do is store a little bit on an exchange and most of your holdings on an offline wallet.

A confirmation happens when a miner includes your transaction in a block. There is a rare chance that a malicious miner confirms that one transaction and tampers with it, that's why people wait for 3 or 6 confirmations, but it is not at all necessary unless you want to be overly cautious.

You have a bus carrying luggage, and it is full. You want to be able to carry more luggage when going from one stop to the next.
One solution is you put a compartment under the bus for more luggage. Sure, it's not much of an increase and it may be a more complicated solution, but it works just great.
Another solution would be to build bigger buses, but many of the bus stops won't have the capacity to handle such large buses and may close down. If small bus stops (nodes) close and only big ones are left, then it defeats the purpose of having a distributed bus network.

The best part about Bitcoin is that there is no dedicated or single software required to propagate a transaction. If you want to send money through PayPal, you *have* to go through PayPal.com but sending a Bitcoin tx is very different. You can even send your private key and receiving address via Morse code and have it propagated to the worldwide network - it will still go through.

I always thought that in the long run, both sidechains and larger blocks were necessary in order to achieve Bitcoin's ultimate goal (being a universal system of value transfer and storage). Both sides have their merits.
Larger blocks have the centralisation problem, but I don't see how we can scale efficiently without them. Then again, sidechains are a great solution but they too open the door to a myriad of problems. I support Bitcoin Core and their ideologies of Bitcoin's future, and I also support what Bitcoin Cash stands for with their larger blocks. However, I see the faces behind BCH as a major issue. Craig Wright and Roger Ver (the latter being someone who wholeheartedly supported Mt. Gox and has pumped his alts shamelessly, the former being a complete fraud in many ways) are not good names to have behind a coin. The community can tend to be vitriolic and toxic (not to say that doesn't have its fair share of malice, but the difference is quite stark).
In my opinion, we all want Bitcoin to succeed. Things will be tested, they may work or they may not, but come what may - big blocks or small blocks, sidechains or no layers, I do believe that in the long run Bitcoin will succeed, simply because it can withstand any amount of contention and come out stronger than before.
Edit: Thank you, kind stranger!

I don't know how long you've been here, but that's what happens every time. It is always panic and FUD (before people realize that it's just another dip). A real problem is yet to arise (such as a fatal flaw in Bitcoin's code, or Satoshi dumping all of his coins).
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:34:54
One million coins is an immense sell pressure and will undermine trust in Bitcoin. Then again, it may just be another dip, who knows. Just my opinion which may or may not be accurate.

Rates skyrocketed from around 0.008% daily to 2% daily. People are borrowing way more BTC, or people are lending way less. This means:
- people expect altcoins to go up
- people expect BTC to go down

- people want to keep coins in their wallet to receive tokens on the forked chain

Vitalik clearly hasn't seen the post where a Bitcoin Cash team member on Facebook posted something along the lines of "we are plotting the death of BTC and all altcoins, long live Bitcoin Cash".
The continual support of CP is really quite alarming and out of character. Maybe he's just grasping onto straws to defend his point of view. Very sad; I always considered him a genius and a pragmatic person but he is slowly starting to become less practical and more emotional.

To break the consensus rules, you must have exactly that: *consensus*. Sure, you can create more coins, but in a decentralized network, you will be rejected unless you have the support of the majority. I can "program" myself 1,000,000 coins but the miners would reject my invalid transactions. If I convinced 51%+ of them to work for me, then my transactions would be deemed valid and I could create as many coins as I like.

Feasible but unlikely. It completely depends. For example, if Satoshi moved his coins to an exchange, the price would probably crash to below $100. However, if Donald Trump tweeted out "buy Bitcoin" then the price would probably hit 20-50k in no time.

The site bets on a certain outcome that is decided every 20 minutes, and there are 25 outcomes. I bet on 7 of those outcomes. My window has passed and it says that if the transactions do not appear (0-conf) within the window then the transaction will be considered a donation. Weird policy, yes, but understandable. In their eyes, if the transaction doesn't show up, then it hasn't been sent: but I *did* send it through Coinbase. Coinbase's fault that it didn't even propagate.

Okay, I'm going to test your theory in real time.
I opened the app.
Logging in. Typed in the password wrong. Typed it right, logged in.
Get seller's email. Okay, amount to send: $4,000. Clicked send. "We're sorry, we can't send your payment right now." Why? I googled it and it says PayPal got suspicious because the amount is too high. I try sending $50 and it goes through. So I do that several times. Takes around 20 mins. Easy peasy!
I get the address from the seller. Enter the BTC amount. Paste in the address, click send. God damn, you're right man, that was hard af.

Some people want SegWit (which makes the network faster and can handle more transactions). Some people want big blocks (which makes the network faster and can handle more transactions). 
Some SegWit supporters, on August 1st, are going to attempt a "soft fork", splitting the network into two: one for SegWit, and the other for the original Bitcoin network.

No: 17%

...what? In your scenario, the price increased, how is that low? What I said makes perfect sense; please re-read what you wrote.
@_date: 2017-05-07 03:04:27
No fucking shit, it's pretty obvious that's what DCAing is.

What does "TIL" stand for?
@_date: 2017-05-26 09:32:33
That's a really cool site. r/bitcoin was just as funny back in the day.
@_date: 2017-05-29 07:12:11
This is known as an ICO. It's good for real companies but bad because scammers can raise millions in minutes. You're doing nothing new here. Platforms like Kickstarter that can actually verify projects are far superior as they insure thousands if not millions go into the hands of scammers.
@_date: 2017-05-29 08:12:00
False. A third party like Kickstarter does proper ID verification and background checks. However, I could create a false persona, make a beautiful website and video, and gather millions all while sitting at home (if I wanted to) through this. Doomed to fail, imho. GL

Please stop trying to scam people. PayPal will take your money, limit your account, or worse.

Miners aren't retarded, they know SegWit is good and that's why they activated it.
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:06:33
A platform where *anyone* can get money will be overrun by scammers on the release day; I guarantee it. You won't even have the chance for someone real to take a look before the whole thing gets shut down.
@_date: 2017-07-20 10:00:41
Why the delay? I'm sure it'll be activated soon, but Wang Chun has a long history of fucking around. I'd rather not risk it.

@_date: 2017-05-20 14:27:46
Quite; how'd you deduce that?

Subway supported Jared Fogle and Ver supported Mark Karpeles. Just saying.
@_date: 2017-05-16 09:19:17
Not necessarily. It's true for Bitcoin, because whether it be $1 or one million the network won't discriminate. However, if I, using PayPal, try to send upwards of $1000 (with my fully verified account) I get verification requests and random error messages. With unverified accounts,  you flat out can't send money if the amount is above $100.  PayPal limits and closes accounts too.

I hope you realise that BCC doesn't actually exist yet. Anyone can make a site, list it and give it a price. That doesn't make it real.

True story: Craig Wright once broke his nose, and told the doctor he had broken it hundreds of times and had stitched it back together HIMSELF. His mother himself testified that he has a tendency to lie and bend the truth.

Buy a bit every day for a few months.
If you bought ten coins today and the price crashed tomorrow, you'd regret it. But, DCAing is the best because you don't need to worry about the price.
Price went up? Yay, you're slightly richer!
Price went down? Yay, cheap coins!
In the long run, this strategy always works.

My mom bought BTC at $627 and bought around 50 ETH with it (now worth around $6,500). Sadly, she margin traded it away to zero.

How the fuck did "Useless Ethereum Token" get $52k omf

Well... you're not wrong, he is white.

Just sharing. Personally I found 'em funny.

I like the app and gave it that rating. I presume others did too?
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:42:28
And that's why scammers use BTC.
@_date: 2017-05-11 22:54:51
Oh. TIL.
@_date: 2017-07-20 10:01:29
This is such a historic moment.
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:34:40
Absolutely agree. SegWit first is wiser. However, since the other side wouldn't agree, we just need to do both together if we want to move forward.
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:40:53
Current support for SegWit2x is 4.7%. This is a *promise* to signal and is not the signaling itself. Just wanted to clear things up to prevent people from misunderstanding the post.

You can still withdraw ETH without an issue. They claim they are solvent and it shows, withdrawals are going through without a hitch.

Dumbest comment I've read in quite a while... So the white paper is Satoshi "lying" about Bitcoin, not explaining it :D
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:45:52
Look at r/darknetmarkets, every other post is about a stuck tx.
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:34:15
Interesting reply
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:35:52
Ah, the classic troll. Pretends like he knows everything, but when asked for actual *facts*, draws a blank.
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:51:14
Incorrect. SegWit is the better solution, big blocks is the simpler one. I think both are equally needed. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:57:22
Well I did exaggerate a bit, but as a regular reader, I can tell you that before they stickied the stuck tx help info there were tons of posts complaining.
@_date: 2017-06-10 03:49:32
Polo has a better coin collection, more volume, better liquidity. Bittrex has more reliable order execution, withdraw times and less manipulation.
@_date: 2017-06-03 11:54:38
Lucky. I did something similar and got an account closure notice rather than a warning.

I'm of Indian heritage and visit yearly. I'll do some checks and research. PM me if you need someone to go physically visit because that's not a problem for me. Most of my family members are lawyers as well.

For the record, Roger PM'd Loaded and did not get a response. Loaded did not reply on the thread after that either. Roger was not the one who backed out of the deal. Just stating the facts here.
