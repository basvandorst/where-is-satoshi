Updating OP now
@_date: 2014-01-17 23:47:46
lol dude. You're sounding like an idiot right now.

Their staff claim they haven't had fraud....I find that hard to believe, but I still use them once in awhile.
@_date: 2014-02-21 15:57:10
You can't be serious. The last paragraph is just so full of dumb.
@_date: 2014-07-11 15:40:54
You're the only other member I ever see over here. We should grab a drink sometime.
@_date: 2014-08-30 05:33:56
Considering newegg is in CA, 12:01 PST would be a good guess
@_date: 2014-06-12 04:27:53
Are you seriously using a browser with no spell check?
@_date: 2014-03-16 02:25:25
yeah, I want one
@_date: 2014-02-21 15:50:30
just put away the pipe dreams for now and do some research
@_date: 2014-06-05 03:13:23
You coulda just said, "hey, you forgot the most important step"
@_date: 2014-03-11 14:55:57
well fuck, that was unexpected.

It's just the real world kid, what do you expect us to do. Live and learn.
@_date: 2014-09-30 16:32:26
way to show them
@_date: 2014-03-11 00:03:41
Anyone know what happened to the dude in the top right? I know he was a mmj delivery guy down in CO springs that got busted selling over the limit.
@_date: 2014-12-25 03:06:53
Then how did you get the discount to work?
@_date: 2014-09-02 00:28:48
You could try pasting the correct wishlist "share" link. That would probably fix your problem.
@_date: 2014-05-22 15:51:35
I love the psychology that humans have with "big numbers"
@_date: 2014-08-30 22:36:45
@_date: 2014-12-20 22:18:08
You're a fucking idiot.    
Sorry to be blunt, but we have to stop coddling the lowest common denominators of our society.
@_date: 2014-07-22 17:42:53
How is that relevant?
@_date: 2014-06-12 13:57:14
solid logic
@_date: 2014-02-03 23:44:01
I can't believe you paid half. Grow a backbone man.

A million bucks in a 5% CD account would earn $50,000/interest year alone bud. 
It is completely do-able and not even hard.
@_date: 2014-02-21 15:48:59
lol, oh god
@_date: 2014-02-21 23:14:43
It's funny how you think that's why people hype bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-25 14:59:36
I'm not aware of any companies refunding in BTC right now, overstock, dell, etc.
@_date: 2014-08-30 05:34:58
Not sure on this, but I don't think it works on gift cards
@_date: 2014-07-22 17:41:36
  1 decade = 10 years    
  A few decades = 20+ years
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:56:22
Sweet, thanks
@_date: 2014-01-06 19:02:33
you do appear to be, in fact, a special monkey
@_date: 2014-12-25 00:06:59
That's cute
@_date: 2014-12-25 00:41:37
When I mentioned the word supervisor to help me re-order using the gift cards, I was told to CALL back after Christmas. LOL
@_date: 2014-07-16 04:07:23
How did you do the car rental
@_date: 2014-03-29 18:22:20
It's about right for medical prices here. Rec w/ tax would be higher.
@_date: 2014-08-30 22:37:54
ah, I don't know why I assumed everyone else would get the non-kinect/madden version that is $100 cheaper.
Forza is legit and I'm sure the kinect would be useful.
@_date: 2014-08-30 09:04:56
"one per customer"
I am a customer    
My gf is a customer    
My dad is a customer    
etc. etc.    
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:47:20
lol, overreact much?
@_date: 2014-02-13 18:46:43
no problem admitting I am wrong, but elitist is just lol
@_date: 2014-10-15 14:41:19
@_date: 2014-12-25 14:59:08
lol are you fucking serious
@_date: 2014-06-01 19:23:50


How some of you tie your shoes in the morning is mind boggling
@_date: 2014-02-21 23:12:56
crazy isn't it
@_date: 2014-11-06 05:12:14
posting for some
@_date: 2014-12-20 22:53:46
@_date: 2014-12-26 17:06:34
So even though you're able to read the problem right here, you want me to send you an "email" with a link to this thread.
*I should add if you want to put me on Newegg salary, I'd be more than happy to walk you through this.
@_date: 2014-06-30 03:24:25

Still getting goxxed in 5 years.
I approve
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:57:49
uh yeah
@_date: 2014-09-14 16:18:13
Why is this exactly?
@_date: 2014-06-02 22:35:10
He's the VP Marketing of Bitcoin, he better have an expense account for beers.
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:48:52

@_date: 2014-03-09 22:09:05
Is there an easy way to do this
@_date: 2014-02-13 17:10:33
elitist prick? lolwut
@_date: 2014-12-25 00:36:51
I understand they are a retail company, but they have been a tech oriented company since the beginning. For them to not have a grasp on bitcoin is just sad.
I was refunded with worthless gift cards that wouldn't let me re-order because I wasn't paying with btc. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 05:29:42
@_date: 2014-03-16 02:25:51
invite please
@_date: 2014-12-26 17:08:05
Hook, line, and sinker. You're being trolled.
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:50:04
@_date: 2014-02-13 16:34:32
Trustless escrow will be replacing paypal.
@_date: 2014-08-30 05:51:04
@_date: 2014-08-30 22:16:52
*and $100 of other shit
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:53:05
How can you work for a "Major Retailer" and fail to grasp this?
Mind boggling
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:13:57
lol, you created an account just to post that.
@_date: 2014-10-17 18:16:39
Interested as well...
@_date: 2015-01-19 04:36:41
I'll take 1 job plz. (I'll work for free, blockchain, empowerment, etc.)
@_date: 2015-01-19 04:37:52
meh, there are quite a few that will take cc, with no ATM needed.
@_date: 2015-01-19 04:37:29
PM me if you do plz.
@_date: 2014-02-21 15:59:58
What's sarcastic about the first 3 paragraphs? Yeah, you should probably add it if you don't want to look like an idiot.
@_date: 2014-06-27 17:47:17
@_date: 2015-02-12 19:23:13
I'm not. But if btc becomes available, it would sure make traveling to Mexico/Canada and depositing a lot fucking easier.
@_date: 2015-02-12 18:18:31
US player checking in. There are lots of us.
@_date: 2015-02-20 15:44:08
I am 99.5% sure they are in the Boulder/Denver area.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:45:53
After buying 5 last week, I was able to get 5 more today at a steal.
