Sad but true.
@_date: 2014-06-08 03:05:43
Thanks you, sir. This information was very usefull for me! 
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:24:00
So you want to bring some unfairness into the bitcoin business
@_date: 2014-06-10 16:24:55
This long stories about how to make btc more mainstream is silly. You know - you can't do it mainstream by your own. Even BTC ATM can't turn it into mainstream. 
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:24:32
Trust is build on fairness and fairness can't be buld on top of anonimity. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 03:39:57
No. There was a topic yesterday where guy said that somebody tried to rob him to steal his bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 16:26:45


It people want to see BTC more mainstream, or if people want BTC to become a "currency of fututre" they should forget about anonymity
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:18:10
Nice track about Bitcoins. But his voice sucks. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 02:24:14
Really? You should google word "Broker".
@_date: 2014-06-01 02:11:22
Lol. I'm totally agree with you man. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 02:54:11
What? How it connected with BCN (except using the bitcoinarmory i mean)?
@_date: 2014-06-10 16:29:32


Guys we've just discovered a new meaning of awesomeness
@_date: 2014-06-05 08:18:28
Yes, you are! Sometimes BTC discussions are so... unpredictable! 
@_date: 2014-06-10 16:30:22
That is a thing, which could help BTC become more mainstream! To the moon!
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:24:59
Government will try to reguate this sphere and it doesn't matter when it will happen. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 08:55:42
Glad that we have a few people more to watch over our amazing subreddit. 
Hope that our BTC discussions will be fine because of them.
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:22:57
it's a quote from one soap opera about irony. As Superminer notice, it wasn't appropriate
@_date: 2014-06-05 09:09:26
That's why any modern progressive culture is youth centric!
@_date: 2014-06-10 16:33:22
Lol. BTC is in art now. 
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:21:00
His rhymes is not so bad, dude. And the song - it's about bitcoins so we should call him bad ass MC
@_date: 2014-06-05 08:59:01
Because that's what emulative spirit does with people and cryptocurrency
@_date: 2014-06-10 16:01:29
Wow. IO interactive should create a game about Hitman in which 47 will get paid by using Bitcoins
@_date: 2014-06-05 08:46:23
Why this wallet called HD? 
@_date: 2014-06-21 17:41:32
We are nothing more than just a neighboors in one big apartment.
@_date: 2014-06-22 05:28:00
Wikileaks became an information cannon few years ago and don't trust it since that. 
 
@_date: 2014-09-22 06:48:27
I would speculate that UK banks told them to stop allowing Faster Payments from UK customers to their Bitcoin clients unless they want to lose FP entirely.
@_date: 2014-06-10 16:35:08
Now i can buy some new watches...
@_date: 2014-06-10 16:33:42
Amazing! Another way to spend my lovely bitcoins! 
@_date: 2014-06-08 03:12:11
You've actually stole my thoughts dude. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 02:35:20
Never panic and never blame yourself for failure
@_date: 2014-06-05 09:01:24
Lol. I love this gif so much! 
I'll also saw one, but instead of BTC there were dollar, and instead of DOGE - BTC =(
@_date: 2014-06-05 09:11:39
Wow, sounds interesting. I should read something about it! 
@_date: 2014-06-05 09:08:09
Yeah, but youth can do nothing without money which actually belongs to  old men.
@_date: 2014-06-05 08:48:23
It's good, that creator of CryptoLockers now identified by FBY, but does it mean, that they are watching for us and our activity?
@_date: 2014-06-08 03:09:36
What kind of beating they talking about? 
@_date: 2014-06-10 16:27:38
Wow... something connected with BTC was planned in Kenya... unbelievable! 
I mean i don't wanna be a racist, but you know.. Kenya isn't high tech country.
@_date: 2014-06-05 08:15:51
It's not actually opposite. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 09:10:32
You remind me an old joke, which sounds like "In the internet nobody knows that you are an owl". 
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:27:14
Alternative inerpreation seems to be true for me. 
Just because of monthly BTC exchange rate
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:22:55
I totaly agree with you.


Help to avoid the "Bubbles" creating every now and then by Bankers.
@_date: 2014-06-01 08:28:09
Wow. This is amazing. I can feel the future comes. =D
@_date: 2014-06-08 03:29:17
I'd rather say: it's exactly not a "cold storage"!
@_date: 2014-06-10 16:32:00
It's not what irony means! Read a book!  (c) 
@_date: 2014-06-05 09:05:22
I must to admit, that it can't become international in a few mounth, maybe in a couple of years... but i'm not sure that it is possible.
