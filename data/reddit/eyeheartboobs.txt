But even as a fixed rate, the inflation decreases over time as the fixed fee becomes a smaller % change to the total currency. 10BTC will inflate a market of 100BTC more than it will inflate a market of 110BTC.

So the fee issue is really just too many people trying to get on the boat, and therefore having to bit for a spot, and not at all affected by the fee/reward?

Again, that's not an answer to my question. My question wasn't, "what does think of inflationary/deflationary currency".

That's not really and answer to my question. My point being, that a consistently inflating currency, that effectively inflates at a decreasing rate, while still "inflationary currency", would act more like a deflationary currency, compared to what we currently know of, like USD.

It was absolutely not part of it. Not only was he never convicted of hiring a hitman, but he was never even charged with it. It was mostly used to make him seem dangerous in the public eye. People see a nerdy kid who made a market place website, they struggle to see him go to prison for life, but if they're led to believe that person tried to kill people, they care much less about his life.
If there was sufficient, or any evidence of a murder for hire, why would it not have been added to his charges?
