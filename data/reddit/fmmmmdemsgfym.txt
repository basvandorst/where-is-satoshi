Just thought i'd point it out for any new ppl looking for a wallet. Stay way from Jaxx.

They still haven't given their users BCH.
They are still "working on it".

anyone who buys bitcoin or any investment should expect to hold it for 5-10 years. honestly, if they buy at 4500, 4900, 5200, it doesnt matter in the long run bc they bought it probaly thinking it'll go way over 10k. who cares short term, unless ur a trader

where do you see this? link to transaction?

The new one now wont have replay protection from wha ti understand and that is very bad.
it means if u sell  ur new free coins ur original btc coins will also be sold
thats why a lot of ppl are fighting it
if i understand right

this is wrong. so much misinformation going around.
this is not bitcoin itself. and jpm is just buying for their clients. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:25:32
the fall was just tons of fud
if you really know bitcoin and its possibilities and the fundamentals you will buy when shits on sale. 
weak hands get crushed, strong hands accumulate more.

I have gotten my BTG on Binance.
They have opened a pair for it.
Is it safe for me to sell it? Does it have replay protection?
I dont want BTG but dont want to lose my original btc if i sell my btg
