I am not talking about switching from PoW to something entirely different, I am talking about switching from random puzzles to proof of actual work, some actual improvement.
Edit: I'll edit that point out (~~What if we could make PoW productive?)~~ because it's actually a whole different topic and I wanted to focus on how Bitcoin mining is better for us than gold mining

Banks might reinvent themselves and start providing the infrastructure needed for Bitcoin. Not all banks will die
@_date: 2019-03-26 01:19:38
I agree, for most people that's true. But I'd rather not put all my coins in one place

Which is why you become less of a risk if you put a little bit here, a little bit there. Having some percentage on an exchange that is somewhat regulated and has insurance can definitely be a good thing. But coinbase became a little bit more sketchy with that recent acquisition, so it makes sense to be careful.
@_date: 2019-03-07 13:38:36
Simple, but true.

First you have to understand money. Bitcoin is the next step.

Would anyone have warned her if she was trying to send $ instead of BTC? 
@_date: 2019-03-26 19:03:09
If farming oranges would be deadly and farming apples would not be, I'd rather farm apples as long as I can survive without oranges. Not arguing for an immediate change in how we value gold vs. Bitcoin. But I do believe the peace and safety that Bitcoin can bring to humanity is underestimated. One of those aspects is, that mining Bitcoin in an of itself is safer than mining gold. 
@_date: 2019-03-25 22:03:16
Make sure not to store your BTC on an exchange. It's dreadful how many people are thrown off crypto due to security issues.
edit: Oh and congrats of course ��

We need more awareness for apps like these

Exactly, US customers will receive DigiPiglets which they can load up themselves (for a cheaper price of course).
@_date: 2019-04-08 22:53:13
The number of years necessary to hold in order to become profitable will probably increase in the future. Still, hodling is always a good idea if you are inexperienced.

What about removing the "no crypto" variant altogether? We do want to encourage people to buy at least a little bit of Bitcoin. In order to display it separately, we'd have to create two separate products, but then perhaps less people would buy the Bitcoin version? We could still offer to ship without crypto and reduce the price afterwards if someone prefers it that way.
@_date: 2019-04-09 09:35:03
We do have a [sample picture]( that shows the honeycomb pattern which will provide tamper evidence. The front will look something [like the Casascius coins]( only with an updated design. The label will stick in a little notch underneath the DigiPiglet, so it won't be visible unless you lift it up. I'll upload more pictures soon!
@_date: 2019-04-09 18:57:52
~~We're not operating in the US~~
We are not shipping loaded DigiPiglets to the US.

People tend to forget that. And people especially forget, how much development is active at this very moment
@_date: 2019-01-21 17:08:58
Just don't lose your cool if it does happen to drop lower 
@_date: 2019-01-29 21:17:21
Does this apply if the network is being used all over the world, with almost [no interruptions]( Brand awareness isn't exactly decreasing either. Many governments are becoming more and more crypto friendly. You don't opt out in this stage of development.
@_date: 2019-01-31 15:33:25
You're right. "*Using excess electricity"* would've made more sense 
@_date: 2019-01-24 22:24:41
If the Bitcoins are only accessible with the private keys, and the private keys are solely located on Mars, then that comes pretty close to "being on Mars"

It's great to see someone take the time to explain the technology to a beginner ����

Bitcoin has the lowest risk in terms of stability. You might not 100x your money with Bitcoin, but you probably won't lose it either. Everything else has a chance of higher gains but far more risk.
@_date: 2019-01-31 16:41:51


In economic terms there is. 


That was not my claim. Miners get to buy clean and cheap energy right at the source, electric plants have a bigger market to sell their product, and regular people (Bitcoin users) benefit from having a payment system that works without millions of energy consuming employees in different branches using IT, cars, paper and so on. It's not what this article was focussed on (it was more focussed on Alex de Vries' statements) but it's an often overlooked fact which is why I pointed it out.  
@_date: 2019-01-27 12:40:35
If people accept this solution, there's gonna be a growing number of people holding small Bitcoin amounts, which will increase stability for the network as a whole 
@_date: 2019-01-17 14:56:22
Just the device most people use to log on here is probably 5x to 10x that.
@_date: 2019-01-25 21:18:41
Certainly not a bad sign
@_date: 2019-01-28 23:14:26
If you are unexperienced, you'll make more money buying and just holding for a long period of time
@_date: 2019-01-17 01:36:05
I agree. Whenever the media starts making jokes about Bitcoin, it bottoms
@_date: 2019-01-31 18:51:32
Where did he say the price will increase?  


@_date: 2019-01-15 01:05:35
All those people on the "fringe" need that little push to get involved. Good stuff OP
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:35:52
Same applies to most gold investors, or any market really
@_date: 2019-01-14 15:53:44
1. Biggest network effect so far (brand recognition + trust)
2. Constant improvement on this open source project will make it work despite the shortfalls it currently has against SWIFT and the likes 
3. [

Start with just saving/holding for a longer-term. Can't go wrong there
@_date: 2019-01-14 15:43:36
Likely a small country or island nation. If it's a country like Switzerland, others will soon follow
@_date: 2019-01-21 17:06:07
This is terrible not only on an economic level
@_date: 2019-01-16 20:25:43
He said put in "under $40". $40 is a reasonably low amount to risk?
@_date: 2019-01-31 10:05:15
Great article, I guess an important takeaway is that crypto can be mined right at the energy source, using electricity that would otherwise simply vanish. Can't really do that with a bank.
@_date: 2019-01-31 10:15:26
I'd love to see a comparison between the entire banking sector and the crypto network by this author
@_date: 2019-01-17 01:55:20
If this bear market takes approximately as long as the last one, you are looking at 2019 for a trend reversal
@_date: 2019-01-23 13:53:57


Add to this the economical damage caused when measures fail. It's also easier for the average person to verify their Bitcoin than it is for them to verify a fiat bill.
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:23:52
Congratulations!! Make sure your private keys are safe! You don't want to keep your coins on an exchange for the long-term, be it centralized or decentralized. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 10:50:17
Manage your expectations, you won't become a multimillionaire by putting $100 into Bitcoin. But it's always a good idea to save some money (unless in depreciating fiat)! And starting to actually use it will make you feel intrigued to learn more about the whole financial system. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 13:58:22
That's right, if everyone withdrew their money at the same time, there wouldn't be enough for everybody

Agreed. It's literally like comparing apples and oranges. However, understanding the history of gold will give you a great perspective on Bitcoin.

When Bitcoins price goes up to $1M, 1 Satoshi would be 1¢, which would make it easy for the average person to grasp. That won't happen so soon, but never say never!
@_date: 2019-01-29 22:24:06
It wasn't necessarily fake news. Some big players did scale in, but they won't make the price jump 10x over night. It takes time till sellers run out. Once they do, then you'll see a bull run.
PS: OTC = [Over-the-counter market](

Manage your expectations 
@_date: 2019-01-21 17:14:08
Hopefully this will give people some perspective. Just gotta have patience
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:16:04


That is exactly right. Dismissing gold as an investment has become fairly popular these days. That does not mean one should not study its history. And being aware of its development will help have a broad perspective on the markets (and opportunities).
@_date: 2019-01-23 09:48:25


The first notable use of Bitcoin as a means of payment was when someone bought 2 pizzas for 10k Bitcoin in 2010  
[  
It was certainly useable before that, and there might have been some other transactions. However, this one caught everyones attention.
