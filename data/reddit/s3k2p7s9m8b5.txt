Quantum computing is no threat to Bitcoin, that has been debunked many times. When they become available (in a few decades) open source bitcoin will have adjusted its protocol long in advance. Bitcoin is antifragile, the more is attacked, the stronger it gets. And when the age comes where quantum computers ARE a threat, both the bad guys and the good guys, and the average citizen, will have them. It'll be much like it is now. Most progress made in the hardware industry is pretty linear. Worrying about quantum computers right now is certainly a waste of energy, given that quantum computers are still in their infantile stages, and can only operate at absolute zero temperatures. (Hint: It's an extremely difficult job to find a way to bring absolute zero cooling methods to the consumer market.). While ECDSA is indeed not secure under quantum computing, quantum computers don't yet exist and probably won't for a while. The DWAVE system often written about in the press is, even if all their claims are true, not a quantum computer of a kind that could be used for cryptography.
Bitcoin's security, when used properly with a new address on each transaction, depends on more than just ECDSA: Cryptographic hashes are much stronger than ECDSA under QC. Bitcoin's security was designed to be upgraded in a forward compatible way and could be upgraded if this were considered an imminent threat.

The future economy will be totally digital and decentralized. Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see Blockchain technology) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible in smaller units). "Backed by Government" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks. Bitcoin is limited and decentralized.
**Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:**
* Very cheap regardless of amount sent (a few cents fee).
* Borderless (no country can stop it from going in/out or confiscate)
* Trustless (nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work)
* Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
* Securely (encrypted cryptographically and can’t be confiscated)
* Permissionless (no approval from central powers needed)
* Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
* Open source (auditable by anybody)
* Worldwide distributed (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet)
* Censorship resistant (no government can stop its use)
* Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
* Portable (easier to carry/move than cash, gold and silver)
* Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
* Scalable (each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals)
* Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
* Deflationary (its supply goes down with time until reaching 21 million ever)
* Immutable global registry (can’t be altered/hacked by nobody)
* No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿
*And that’s just as currency, Bitcoin has many more uses and applications.*

You are correct, it is much more easier to lose your coins if you store them yourself (for many reasons), unless you are an expert or at least computer saavy, which the vast majority of the population aren't. Coinbase and Gemini are safe, fully licenced and regulated in the US and comply with all KYC/AML rules and regulations. Moreover, if you use Coinbase Vault it is extra safe, it can't be hacked and they store the coins in cold storage.

The Blockchain has been proven very stable and anti-fragile, the more is attacked the stronger it gets. Governments can try to put barriers, but can't ban mathematics, can't kill decentralized systems, only can affect individual companies, but never bitcoin/blockchain itself. And it has been proven also very safe: Centralized companies/entities (Silk Road, MtGox, NeoBee, Butterfly, MyCoin, PayCoin/PayBase, etc) fail due to their own corruption and/or incompetence, and can be a scam or a ‘ponzi’, like in any other area. The Blockchain (the system/protocol/platform) remains untouched because it is decentralized and 'antifragile', evolving and becoming ever stronger.
We are far away from MtGox times. We have now secure software and hardware wallets very easy to use. Also,  exchanges like Gemini.com or Coinbase.com are fully licensed and regulated by the US Government and Agencies, they comply with all KYC/AML laws and regulations.
Coinbase Vault is very safe for storage, they store &gt;99% of bitcoins offline in cold storage, so they can't be hacked/stolen. If you are not tech savvy (like &gt;99% of world population) it's much more probable that you end up losing them (for many reasons) if you store them yourself. Even if the internet goes down, it will be only temporarily, and anyway bitcoin can be stored offline on paper or hardware wallets and transferred via radiofrequency/radiowaves, a peer-to-peer decentralized system is not going to disappear, the future systems will be decentralized and digital.

No way, those were old times, now there are many Countries picking up all the dips, bitcoin is becoming more mainstream by the day. More and more people in Africa, India, Japan, South America etc. are entering the game every day, so we won't see any large dips or "crashes" anymore unless we get into a real bubble (like going over $5000 this year, and even then, we may retrace just a little bit. Who knows, just keep hodling and buying the dips. See you @ $10,000 next year.

Some people commenting aren't getting the point, also the ones downvoting the video and this post. The point is that it always "crashes" at a higher point than the previous bubble/run. It is sarcasm, so he really makes the point for always to buy bitcoin because it keeps going up despite the corrections.

Nobody, no individual and no central power or government can control, manipulate, ban, hack or kill a worldwide distributed open-source peer-to-peer cryptographically secured decentralised system.
Bitcoins will continue to increase in value, more than gold and silver, there will only be 21 million bitcoins ever, they are cryptographically and mathematically secured, it is decentralized, so can't be banned, co-opted or confiscated/stolen by any central group or government, you hold your own private keys.
The future economy is digital and decentralized.﻿

When they finally re-open up, the sentiment will be very bullish and that would compensate for any initial selling they may see. They would be fools to sell those coins, and if they do, there will be thousands of buyers in China and around the world willing to scoop up those cheap coins.

Read again, it does not say "free", and regarding it being fast, it is, and it will be even faster once SEGWIT, MimbleWimble, Lighting Network, etc. and many other layers on top of bitcoin make it more efficient.

Bitcoin has outperformed every other currency, commodity, stock and asset since its inception in 2009.


















The future economy will be totally digital and decentralized. Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see Blockchain technology) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible in smaller units). "Backed by Government" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks. Bitcoin is limited and decentralized.
**Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:**
* Very cheap regardless of amount $$$ sent (a few cents fee).
* Borderless (no country can stop it from going in/out or confiscate)
* Trustless (nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work)
* Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
* Securely (encrypted cryptographically and can’t be confiscated)
* Permissionless (no approval from central powers needed)
* Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
* Open source (auditable by anybody)
* Worldwide distributed (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet)
* Censorship resistant (no government can stop its use)
* Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
* Portable (easier to carry/move than cash, gold and silver)
* Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
* Scalable (each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals)
* Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
* Deflationary (its supply goes down with time until reaching 21 million ever)
* Immutable global registry (can’t be altered/hacked by nobody)
* No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿
*And that’s just as currency, Bitcoin has many more uses and applications.*
