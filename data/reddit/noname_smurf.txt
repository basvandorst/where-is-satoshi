Thanks for your detailed reply!  
She's not that good with computers, she told me its "on her desktop" so it might be in a wallet there or stored plaintext or just a scam, ill try to investigate further, just using reddit to get into the topic since there are usually awesome people like you helping with new stuff. 
Yeah, i hope we can get them for her, she could really need it. Never considered trying to send them to test if they are real, thanks a lot! :)  
  
Ill try to sort things out now, will probably post here again if new questions arrise.   
Thanks again, you and the others here really helped me a lot, hope you all have an awesome day! :)

She got them of some other friend of hers who regretted buying them if i got that right. Thats why she's not sure if they are legit
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:48:35
Wallet? Is that a program to keep them in? As i said, i have no idea and just want to help her. I just thought reddit would be the fastest way to learn the important things :)

She said she has them on her PC. And she has no idea what to do with them. Is there a way to check if they are legit or if she got scammed back then?

What kinds of information would i need? And are there different kinds of bitcoin or why is it importabt where she got them?   
Sorry if i sound ignorant, just trying to help her :)

I know, she has them on her PC. I just have no idea weather i can somehow check for her if they are legit or if she got scammed. Is there any kind of way to check them without risking loosing them?
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:41:34
Yeah, she said a few years ago
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:54:16
Ok, ill try to figure it out, thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:53:49
Ah, ok.
She sent them to her, but i couldnt get her to see how they are stored. She's pretty old, she told me they are "on her desktop", so they might be in a wallet or keys stored plaintext in a .txt, so ill just visit her and try to figure stuff out.  
  
Thanks, your reply made stuff a bit clearer for me
