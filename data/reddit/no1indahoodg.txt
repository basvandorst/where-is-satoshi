Lol like btc isn't down over 80% from ath
@_date: 2019-03-18 15:21:38
It's gonna dump on you. 21 club will be deluded with all of the sidechains
@_date: 2017-08-28 08:25:13
Since when is a fork an attack?
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:45:04
Or switch to BCH. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 03:34:16
Coinomi supports BCH as well as others with plenty more on the way. Currently BCH can be traded on many exchanges and will very soon be available to sell for fiat across exchanges as well. I imagine merchant adoption will soon follow with the current state of BTC and no planned solution.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:25:34
Yes, if you would like to use actual bitcoin please use BCH
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:43:04
Wait, you're happy with paying an 11% fee?
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:23:38
Aint much value in &gt;50% fees
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:42:41
the cashening?
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:04:14
While you do offer some valid points, i wouldn't go as far as saying the fees are low because of volume. Fees are low in BCH because the 8mb blocks can handle the traffic. BCH also offers fast tx speeds on small amounts via 0conf
*edit please see fork.lol for volume data
@_date: 2017-08-27 05:27:38
I still saw your thread :)
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:14:08
That's from all the hodl'rs. Look on august 16th volume spike and august 23rd. During these times BCH was still cheap and fast. BCH works

Uhh Luke jr. said not to use segwit yet
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:39:17
Scamcoin bch? Do you mean the real bitcoin that allows cheap transactions on the blockchain?
@_date: 2019-12-23 22:04:52
Lol LN, keep the dream alive.
@_date: 2019-12-23 22:05:46
What do you expect with the fees and slowness of BTC?
@_date: 2019-04-27 17:43:00
Sweet, now someone can add it to this
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:15:50
What? Bitcoin is a store of value, not a currency.
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:41:43
I don't know man, i've seen some prominent members from within the bitcoin community say that bitcoin is meant to be a store of value rather than a currency. I would find quotes but im too lazy right now.

Most tech is all hype until it comes to fruition.

Microsoft is such a trusted company when it comes to decentralization. /S
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:28:01
Heed your own advice buddy. I understand fully
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:18:36
I keep seeing this phrase, "...ended up on the wrong side of history" from core supporters. Why is that? I'll repeat what i said in another thread. Core/Blockstream will be remembered as the AOL of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-10-08 18:08:37
Yup, that's usually the case.

Everyone uses the tulip example because that's one of the first bubble crashes they learn about in eco
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:49:48
Keep telling yourself that

I don't follow?
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:39:22
Which posts? 
@_date: 2018-04-16 19:10:25
I don't know bro, looks like a bcash event to me
@_date: 2017-05-26 07:35:38
I've been trying all afternoon and night to buy btc. I'm new, so i'm still in the verification process on gemini and coinbase keeps canceling all of my cc transactions. I wanted to buy in this dip but its looking like i'll have to catch the next one. It"ll be $2900 by 9am knowing my luck
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:58:54
Thanks for the tips fellas
