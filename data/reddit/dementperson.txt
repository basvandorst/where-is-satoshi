I could sell my house for bananas if I wanted to. The reason why I asked specifically about stocks is I can only demand a price in the fiat value.
For example on my internet broker, I can't chose to sell my stocks for bitcoin, only fiat

The concept of cryptocurrency denominated stocks is graspable, but the question was: what will happen with the stocks that are denominated in fiat?
If usd becomes worth zero, wouldn't that make the stock also worth nothing? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:01:02
And if the stocks are denominated in USD you find that strange?
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:31:59
I see. I was under the impression that stocks I bought denominated in a certain currency needed to be sold for the same currency, hence why I thought they would become worthless if the currency collapsed. 
When/if the time comes it'll be good to know that they can be sold for whatever medium of exchange is prevailant.

Whatch the take on the debt ceiling from this series [hidden secrets of money]( I can't recommend it enough. 
Of course it all comes down to what the puppets are told to do, but if they actually decide to not raise it then Trump and Yellen will be held responsible for the biggest economic depression in the history of mankind even though they had nothing to do with the creation of it.

But I'm with you brother, I just haven't had the same time to prepare as you. It all started three years ago for me when I noticed the out of control prices in housing (I live in Sweden and the prices never fell here). Home prices are about 20 years income compared to 4 years income in the 90s.

You cite FED cpi as inflation? Give me a break.. The real inflation is the expansion of the money supply, be it M1, M2 or most appropriately M3.
Look up that annual average increase and you'll see how much they dilute the currency. If they were serving juice it would taste like water. 
In 10 years the money supply has quadrupled, mening whatever you had back in 2006 now has to compete against 4 times the money. Why do you think housing shoot to the moon, it's because it's the number 1 thing which people spend their money on.
The US 'intend' to never pay back their debt because they simply can't; the debt is greater than the money that exists. Every dollar in existance has interest on it, where do you get the additional money to pay the interest back? That's right you borrow even more money. 
Nobody likes being in debt but sadly this is how our monetary system works. It's one of the main reasons bitcoin is looking so appealing.

Many people trashtalk coinbase (awful fees yes) but the intuitive UI is what has made them successful, but as a result they lack diversity.

If you think usd is money then good for you, you do not need to read any further. 
Every fiat currency is nothing more than a lie, a false promise from a government to pay back debt to the bearer upon demand. In our monetary system there's always more debt than there is money. 
Every second of every year governments steal wealth away from the people through inflation (imcrease of money supply; NOT increasing prices, they are merely the symptom). 
Because of this, not the US nor any other government will ever pay back its debt. They will either default on their promise or try to inflate their way out like they always have; in germany, zimbabwe and what EU and US are currently doing with QE.

I agreed with most of that article but this sentence got me really annoyed:




Could it be that gold is the stable store of value and it's the currency that's debasing?
Visualise a water tank with a float/bobber. If you pour in more water, the float rises with the tide, maybe not instantly but it will rise to the surface. 
If the tank is the economy, water is the money supply, water level is the prices, and the float is gold. You can't blame the float (gold) for adjusting to the money supply that YOU manipulated. 
This is the exact reason why I'm accumulating bitcoin, to part my wealth from the fraudulent monetary fiat system.

Monetary base has quadrupled from 800 bn to roughly 4 trillion since 2006.
 [source: FED]( meaning the FED is creating "money" to prevent the economy from collapsing. 
M3 money supply has doubled in the same period. 
Meanwhile CPI has only increased 26%.
Since the money supply increase is greater than the CPI increase it means that the biggest chunk of money is put to hiding; in obligations, in stocks, in peoples bank accounts etc. 
Most people are not willing to spend their money like central banks want, except for housing. But when the day finally comes that people feel secure they can afford to spend their "money" a shit load of currency will come out of hiding and prices will skyrocket. 
Housing in Sweden didn't correct itself but has quadrupled since 2006, similarily with our m3 supply. 
I can't convince you that currency is not money but if you want a good watch, then I highly recommend [this series](

I'm convinced. 
You are either deceiving yourself or deliberately trying to deceive others. 
**"piling PoW quorum systems into one data set"** 
describes how other unrelated digital assets need to stand on their own as a separate network in order to keep the space for bitcoin to scale. Bitcoin would never scale if all the other thousands of cryptocurrencies/assets piled up on bitcoin. 
**"rejected remove 1mb hard fork cap"**
Bitcoin had 100 (one hundred) transactions per day in that period,  which means that even 1kb blocks would fit the transaction volume. Satoshi pointed out that there was no need to jump ahead but simply raise block size as demand rises, and even theymos understood that. 
**"he was a proponent of soft forks"**
He designed bitcoin to be flexible (modular in technical terms) and tried to predict as many future appliances as possible to make it a one-fit-all to prevent *unnecessary* hardforks to support new transaction types. That is just good design and does not mean implementing soft forks to increase block size. 
**"in a few decades"**
A few decades does not mean 7 years. A few decades mean at least 30 years. "A few" = a small number, not zero, but over two (which is called a pair). Also notice how he says transactions are mostly free except for really large transactions:




**"in 20 years there will be very large transaction volume or no volume"**
This is Satoshi saying: in 20 years, Bitcoin will be widely adopted or it will be totally abandoned.

Please go ahead and tell me what quality groceries store 1 has over store 2.
Do you at all care about these nostalgic things like: SatoshiDice and tipping bot? In two months time coinbase and bitpay will be available to store 2, what is there left then that store 1 has?
And no, decentralisation in this context would be that:
Store 1 has 10 000 owners (miners) and 100 000 club members (non-mining nodes) 
Store 2 has 10 000 owners and 30 000 club members
Both are still perfectly decentralised
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:25:43
Please stop with the "store of value" nonsense. 
Cryptocurrencies have not even existed ten years and have not even seen a financial crisis yet. That's when you really get to see how good of a store of value it is. Only precious metals have a proven track record as store of value independent of cultures, governments time epochs etc.
There is nothing that makes Bitcoin a store of value at the moment and it has yet to prove itself during a really nasty recession.
And again "store of value" is relative. It has good store of value if you compare to zimbabwe or venezuela but bad store of value if you compare to developed countries. Just because something happens to rally during 2017 does not mean it's a good store of value
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:28:49
It sure can. 
However, the both bitcoins have the foreleap of being evenly distributed among eachother, meaning if you had credit at store 1 you also have credit at store 2.
That's exclusive for the both bitcoins and can't be said for any other coins.

So again, what you are describing is a niche utility that by its design excludes the vast majority of people and their transactions. The bitcoin you are describing is aimed for the rich and forgets everyone else. That is not the libertarian bitcoin dream, but the exact opposite.
But you are right about the inventor. He was truly for small blocks;That's why he went with 32mb blocks in the original design and then as a temporary measure capped it to 1mb to prevent spam when the network wasn't worth anything. He wanted everyone to run their own mining rigs instead of thousands of big server farms by large corporations in different countries.

You have a very valid point:
If there were two grocery stores in your area:
Store 1:  
* has one cashier
* always has a queue and sometimes has very long queues
* bags for the groceries cost $5 and are increasing each month. 
* has a big but slowly decreasing assortment/collection
Store 2:
* has eight cashiers
* never has any queue
* bags for the groceries cost $0.1 and don't increase. 
* has a small but quickly increasing assortment/collection
The gradual shift from store 1 to store 2 is inevitable even if store 1 has promised to introduce self check out lines 18 months from now.

The everything bubble won't be funny and all the people saying they hope bitcoin goes to $600 have most certainly not been around when the price dropped from $30 to $2 or from $1150 to barely above $200 (which it stayed at for almost 3 years).

Bitcoin is not a service. Bitcoin is supposed to be uncensored peer to peer money. Bitcoin was not designed to have fees at this stage. Fees were supposed to replace block rewards when the last bitcoin was minted. Money is no good if it can't be deployed at will.

There's no problem with my understanding and I'm perfectly capable of reading.
It's just that what you're describing is very far from the original project.
The maximum message size was 32mb so that became the arbitrary max limit for the blocks. His design, correct?
Fees were meant to be significant when block incentive became negligible, that means when block incentive approaches zero and that happens 100 years from now.
Now, you can actually convince me really easy:
Provide simple samples of Satoshi suggesting:
-Keeping blocks small
-ridiculous fees early
-sidechains as opposed to main blockchain ledger

Either you didn't read his comment or you don't know what you're talking about.
Bail outs are off the table now as they have made legislations against it to calm the public after the last financial crisis. 
Bail ins however have taken its place and function similarily. The difference between bail out and bail in is that instead of governments or central banks giving extra money at the expense of the taxpayer the new bail in rules that the holders of a bank, i.e stock holders, bond holders, lenders will be the ones that have to pay up. 
Lenders can be big corporations and institutions but they are also every person keeping momey deposited with the bank. A person who holds money in a bank is lending the money to the bank.
Although they say deposits are protected under EU bank directive that every deposit up to 100€ is protected I have a hard time believing that when the next and final economic collaps will happen that it will hold.

A stock represent a percentage of ownership in a company, that is company assets, liabilities, earnings etc. 
* the stock may not yield dividend now for reasons such as expansions or other strategical investments, but if the company is performing well it's plauaible that its owners want to take out dividends in the future. 
* even if a well doing company doesn't take out dividend it will certainly appreciate in value since the company earns good money, remember: stock represent a percentage of that earning.

Other countries have slowly started to realise this and are already bypassing the dollar. 
The "money" as you call it is depreciating in purchasing power and is defacto devalued by 7% per year because that's how much new money is being created.

Nick didn't invent bitcoin, he came up with 'Proof of work' with his Bit Gold in 1998.  Satoshi used this in his iteration that he called Bitcoin, but added a dirty solution to the double spending problem that Nick and other cypherpunks couldn't solve; double spending.  Satoshi solved it by distributing the ledger across all nodes which had it's own potential issue: 51% attack. 
Initially Bitcoins block size was unlimited but practically 32mb (message size limit). 32mb  was way overkill for the amount of transactions in the network at the time and bitcoin was only a dollar/btc, therefore to prevent malicious spam attempts Satoshi lowered the block size to 1mb, but clearly stated that once the blocks started to near the block size limit you could phase in bigger blocks. 
He then dissappeared two months later and since then we've have a divided community.

Yes, the annual increase of the monetary supply has doubled in the last ten years, look up [M0]( and [M1](
 (The supply which FED controls, has quadrupled since 2008!!) M2 and M3 to see how much "money" or credit as it should be called, that has been created by banks through loans (M2+M3). Credit is merely numbers typed on a computer and is no more than a IOU, it doesn't exist, yet we use it as "money".

Lets say we play monopoly with 10 people.
Everyone in the game has $100 each except for the bank which has $1000.
Bob goes ahead and loans $500 from the bank with his streets and houses as collateral.
Bob also likes to make bets. He bets Michael that in exchange for $100 now he'll pay $2000 if Michael reaches GO before him.
Michael wins the bet and Bob now owes the bank and Michael a total of $2500. 
Where will Bob get the money from? His underlying assets have halved in value because no one has the money to buy them for the price he bought them for. The bank can't help Bob because they only have $500 left in the counter.
To rescue the game, mr chairman issues new money by writing new notes on ordinary pieces of paper and gives it to the bank.
The bank then scratch the debt with Bob in exchange for his assets and gives Michael his $2000.
So the total money supply doubled from $2000 to $4000.
Why is that bad for the other players?
Because now each of their $100 are going to have to compete with  double the amount of money, essentially halving their purchasing power.

What you said right there is the single most dangerous thing for Bitcoin. 
By the time they do something malicious its already too late.
It was too late to fight central banking in 1913 after the federal reserve act was enacted.
It was too late to claim your gold for dollars in 1971 after Nixon rendered the the bretton woods system unfunctional. 
It will definitely be too late to save bitcoin after any malicious event has happend.

I said that CPI is what most people think inflation is but that's wrong.
Inflation is an expansion of the money supply. And most of the excess money that is being created is used to buy houses, not TVs and laptops.

Have you even studied economic history?

What about 2011 or 2013? Was bitcoin a store of value then?
You are waving away the last 3000+ years of history in which gold (globally), was the predominant money.  It has been used in generation after generation.  It has seen kingdoms and empires fall and new ones emerge and it still purchased the same goods and services throughout, up until this very day. 
I'm all for bitcoin, but I'm not naive enough to claim that bitcoin outpasses gold in store of value, it has a lot to prove. And it just shows where we currently are in the cryptocurrency space; hype.

It's simpler than that..
Miners don't serve users; they only serve themselves, that's why Satoshi designed an incentive with mining the blocks, the block reward. 
Users are what drives the utility of the coin and what gives it value. 
It's not the users or the miners serving one another but rather that they need each other to survive. 
Without miners the network will come to a halt and without users it won't have any value
This thing is so cleverly designed,  so simple yet so effective it's scary someone actually figured this out... 
Miners and users are the two prisoners on the run, sharing the same foot chain.

Yes there's lots of pessimism in rbtc and lots of positivness in rbitcoin, why?
rbitcoin is usually the first subreddit new users end up in. new users bring lots of eagerness, anticipation, hype. etc. which is one of the reason for the many meme and price posts. Also the demographics is younger in rbitcoin. A good guess would be &lt;22 yo males with the strong urge to become millionaires in less than a year. 
rbtc is where most of the old school bitcoiners hang out. They were originally rbitcoiners but many got banned because of their opinions on how to scale bitcoin, namely to stick with what was the intention right from the start (big blocks). rbtc was created when differing opinions in rbitcoin was banned. 
The reason for the very many angry posts is simply because of this reason; they feel that the bitcoin they got to love in the early days was hijacked by a single development team. Demographics is older &gt;26 yo and many are probably already millionaires and don't care about price anymore.

What? 
I get it, you can't answer my question with anything thoughtful so instead you restort to trying to be funny by implying that Craig is somehow Satoshi; Only an idiot, who appeal to authority would believe such a thing unless unquestionable proof was surfaced.
But since you didn't answer why Gavin was dethroned I can try to give my opinion on why. First ask yourself:
Why did Craig Wright claim to be Satoshi? Why did James Files claim to have killed JFK?
Some people will seek fame, attention or acknowledgement with every opportunity and for any reason. The motives; anything from money, to power, to the simple aspect of self fullfillment of an envisioned identity.
Wether Craig had any incentives to gain to pretend to be Satoshi or if he actually tried to come clean and 'reveal' himself is irrelevant as to why Gavin was kicked out.
Let's investigate why Gavin backed up Craig. These are some alternate scenarios:
* Gavin knew Craig wasn't Satoshi but backed up his claim to protect the real Satoshis identity, knowing Satoshi didn't want to be discovered.
* Gavin knew Craig wasn't Satoshi but backed up his claim anyway believing it wouldn't matter since everyone could be Satoshi; Bitcoin doesn't have a single point of failure.
* Gavin didn't know wether Craig was or wasn't Satoshi but decided to back up Craigs claim simply because people trusted Gavin to know Satoshi above anyone else, he was preassured between the community and the 'apparent' inventor.
* Gavin knew Craig was the real 'Satoshi' and backed him up but retracted his statement when Craig didn't show the proof.
So why was Gavin kicked out?

I have nothing against loans; it's fractional reserve banking that I have everything against. 
If I have 100 and let you borrow 100 and want 10 extra as a fee for doing so then I'm totally fine with that. It's when I only have 3 but still let you borrow 100 that I have a problem with it.
In the latter case I should not be able to loan you anything because I don't have that amount to loan out. 
Yet this way of creating money is perfectly possible with todays banking system and anyone who thinks that its a good system seriously needs to revaluate why every nation on the planet has rising debts.

So the M0 money supply (which is notes and coins in circulation) just happend to jump up from 800 billion in 2008 to 4 trillion in 2017 all by itself? 
Was it not because the FED started buying up every single bond that the US treasury issued with their own unbacked FED checks? 
[Printed or not, the FED has created 3,2 trillion in the last decade.](
Continue to live in your fairytale that the government only replace worn out notes. Hell they even let counterfeit notes be in circulation because it helps to stimulate the economy. 
Money printing aside; the majority of new money (or debt as it should be referred to as) is created in the banking system in the form of bank credit; that is whenever someone take a loan. This is the M3 money supply which also includes M0.

Give me a credible source saying Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland are some of the most expensive to live in for the citizens of said countries. 
It's expensive yes, but we earn more and so relatively speaking it's not that expensive. 
What is the Purchasing Power Pairty (PPP)  of the top countries in the world?
Rank | Country | PPP in USD | Gini Coefficient
6	 Norway | 69,249 | 23,5 -  1st
11	 USA | 57,436 | 41,1 - 39th
15	 Sweden | 49,836 | 25,4 - 5th
21	 Denmark | 47,985 | 26,7 - 8th
27	 Finland | 42,165 | 25,6 - 6th
Gini coefficient tells you how distributed the wealth is where 0 is perfect even distribution (everybody owns the same amount) and 100 is perfect uneven distribution (one guy owns everything.)
PPP per capita is the average and so the median is way lower for an american than a Scandinavian because the wealth is distributed more evenly.

That's semantics.
Whenever the money supply is increased the purchasing power of existing money will be reduced, regardless of wether the money reside as a foreign reserve or in someones bank account. 
The only question is where and when. 
I say where because I doesn't necessarily mean in the US as the US have the benefit of being able to purchase foreign goods with dollars. 
And when because much of the money is being saved, stored and invested. It's the reason for inflated stocks, bonds, housing, cryptocurrencies etc

I never said FED was the government. The FED is a private entity; It has stock owners that earn dividends. The owners are most likely the very same banks that earn a killing being the middlemen between the FED and the Treasury.
Behind the curtains it's the chairman of the FED that runs the United states, they have the power to make or break any president. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:17:42
That's my point.
Money supply × Velocity = Price × Transaction volume = Total spending
MV = PT
Money held in a foreign reserve is no different than money saved domestic in stocks. M is still doubled and when velocity picks up (i.e when money comes out of hiding) we will see spending increase dramatically.
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:32:58
M0 only measures notes and coins; about 15% of the money supply.
M3 is the total money supply including bank credit, which has doubled since 08.
Why then hasn't inflation gone through the roof you might ask?
The answer is: It has.
Inflation, to normal people is called CPI - Consumer Price Index which is a basket of select goods and services. 
That basket does not include real estate, stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies etc but rather, electronics, food, books etc. Due to vast advancement in manufacturing and technology the prices of many products has decreased, such as TVs, computers, phones etc which lowers CPI.
The answer is not *why* inflation hasn't gone through the roof but **where** it has gone through the roof.
The answer is:
* the stock market
* the housing market
* cryptocurrencies
Try to get into those markets and you'll see how much your purchasing power has deteriorated since 08.
Stocks for example are at a CAPE P/E10 of 32, which is the same level as in 1929 right before the great depression and has only been higher in 2001 during the tech bubble when it was at 44.
During the 08 cracsh CAPE went down and barely touched 15 or 'fair value' before it went back into being over valued again.
The same thing has happend with the housing market which has now surpassed the levels it peaked at before the housing crash in 07.
EDIT: People are saying I don't know how inflation work. I do know how inflation work. REAL inflation is an expansion of the money supply. Prices rising is a symptom of that expansion. Soaring assets such as stocks, bonds, housing and even cryptocurrencies are a direct result of expanding money supply.
Because people save, they buy a house. Why is the house prices not included in CPI, which is what people think is inflation? Because if they would, CPI would increase with 5% each year.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:36:35
I don't think you were being an ass, to me it seemed like an honest question.
Again, I don't view CPI as inflation. Only an expansion of the money supply is inflation. And here's why I believe that it is infact an issue:
The stimulus did a so good job that the US equity prices just barely touched fair value of 15 on the cyclical p/e10 before they started returning to over valued again.
The housing prices tanked only to bounce right back up to the same peak they were at right before the crash.
Had the stimulus not been delt out it would probably have caused defaults and a giant recession and maybe even a depression but the market would have corrected itself. 
What the stimulus did was to hyperinflate an already inflated market. And, instead of one bubble (housing) US now has a bubble in stocks, housing, bonds, cryptocurrencies all at the same time; it's unpreceedented..
Had CPI included HPI then 'inflation' would be much more than it is now and prices would rise accordingly.
Purchasing power is affected by prices but is indirectly correlated with money supply. Whenever the money supply is increased the purchasing power of existing money will be reduced, the only question is where and when.
I say where because I doesn't necessarily mean in the US as the US have the benefit of being able to export its inflation to other countries, and when because much of the money is being saved, stored and invested. That is why we see inflated stocks, housing, cryptocurrencies etc but not so much everyday prices of goods and services. 
CPI takes none of those assets into account and paints a false picture because reduced purchasing power is also presented in the ability to buy stocks, houses and other assets and not just 'every day goods and services'.
However, when all that excess money comes out of hiding the prices will go through the roof across the whole board.
My analogy is this:
Imagine you're sitting in a bar and you just ordered a glass of juice. The bartender serves you a half-full glass of juice and then says that every 10 minutes you will get a 10% refill. You want that glass full so you wait.
Every 10 minutes the bartender takes the glass, turns around and removes 10% juice, fills up 20% with water and colouring dye, all this without you seeing it.
He then puts down the glass and you look at it; it's finally full... Now before you taste it, is the juice diluted or not?

If you mean CPI then no it's not 7%, the FED even has a hard time reaching 2% but that's avg. price difference of select goods and services. There's a reason housing prices was taken out from the measurement, because put them back in and you'll see what kind of increase in CPI it would be.  
Yes, the annual increase of the monetary supply has doubled in the last ten years, look up [M0]( and [M1](
 (The supply which FED controls, has quadrupled since 2008!!) M2 and M3 to see how much "money" or credit as it should be called, that has been created by banks through loans (M2+M3). Credit is merely numbers typed on a computer and is no more than a IOU, it doesn't exist, yet we use it as "money".

There's a fundamental reason why I'm steering away from the two 'instances' you mention.
But lets be honest; 
PayPal has the most convenient user interface of all payment services, and there's something that's always true to both electrons and humans and that is "path of least resistance" and "principle of least effort". 
The reality is that Bitcoin needs to get more convenient than all the other payment services. Fundamenta is not something the majority of people take into account, as has been proven from time to time again.

Money can be created in two ways:
* a government issues a bond which banks buy and swap for a check from a central bank
* a person borrows money from a bank; since the bank only have a fraction of the money it's lending out it has to create money called bank credit (this is where most of the money is created, it's also the main reason for the need of a security for the loan.

If it's filthy rich then the equation relies on said 'normal folks' adopting the currency and you accumulating enough before they do. 
Since the bitcoin supply is considered 'fixed' it has to be the currency supply invested in bitcoin that will need to expand. 
* Currency supply / Bitcoin supply = value per coin
* Currency supply = Avg. wealth × person invested
Bitcoin is currently at $36bn or 0,06% of the total global currency supply with the avg. wealth of $10,5k per person invested. 
If filthy rich is $30m dollars then you either need to accumulate lots of bitcoin or the value of each coin need to skyrocket. 
At 1% of total market penetration you would need to have accumulated 754 bitcoin to be worth $30m.
At 25% of total market penetration you would need to have accumulated 25 bitcoin to be worth $30m.

That's one instace; what about all the other hundereds of coins?
 
Just because someone tells me to go to a casino and put all my currency on roulette No. 24 and I happen to win doesn't make it a good advice and a smart investment

How have you visualised the prise? In Bitcoin (as you wrote) or equivalent of todays 0,1 Btc? 
Lets say in an alternate universe bitcoin would be adopted as a global currency and price per coin would shoot to 2,5 million usd/btc (equivalent purchasing power of today)  would you still reward with 0,1 Btc (equalling 250k usd as of today)?

That's the main tell that there are mostly young people into cryptocurrency, when a month is a medium term investment...
My investment horizon:
* Short term: 1-3 years
* Medium term: 5-15 years
* Long term: 25+ years
Everyone can't get rich quickly but some can definitely get rich in long term, they just need to be more patient than all the others that invested. 
Get rich quick trading might work for people with exclusive information or general luck but they are going to fail for the overwhelming majority

Jailing bankcons is not the measure to cure the crisis after it's happened., it's about chopping heads and enforcing the laws that exists and apply to everyone.. 
Even in a case were financial cons would get inprisoned it wouldn't be the really big guys but the semi-chiefs or middlemen

ELI5: 
If this guy can brute force peoples passwords on wallets; Why aren't there more people being robbed by their coins (besides the obvious moral and etique aspects..) I mean surely there must be more people out there with his knowledge but with bad intentions?
Let's say I have a Ledger nano s.. How easy would it be for him to figure out the password or passcodes to enter the device?

Purchasingpower of dollar increasing 20% in one day the same day as the feb can't explain how they failed to account for trillions of dollars? It's pretty safe to say the cryptomarlet is being manipulated in one way or the other by big guys with bots..

Agree 100% with you. It somehow saddens me that people want etf:s. I'm not buying bitcoin so I can make some quick gains and cash them out to more currency. I'm buying bitcoin because I believe that one day I will be able to buy more with one bitcoin than all of the other paper currencies put together (hyperinflation)

So what happens if the core devs get compromised? Is it still in the hands of the users which way to go?

Do we know what wallet has the most coins? I mean, is it safe to say that "one of these three wallets belong to Satoshi"?

On what side of the bet have you placed yourself?

Not everyone is trying to 'make a buck'.. Frankly, I for one am doing the exact opposite. 
I'd like to think that we're on open sea aboard the giant tanker that is the petrodollar ship and it's taking in water.. The captains (greenspan, bernanke and yellen) are trying to fix the water hole leak by speeding the boat even faster constantly reaffirming passengers and workers onboard  through the speakers that there is no leak and everything is fine.. 
Meanwhile abeam starboard side we have a small fishing boat called bitcoin. A few years ago bitcoin was only a wooden raft and many big waves and sharks almost sank it. 
Now, even though the small fishing boat may be very rocky amid the big waves and may even capsize should a big enough wave sweep by.. But the fact still remains; the bitcoin boat is not pushed beyond its own boundaries by wreckless 'captains' that think they speed and steer the right way. 
I'm currently making the anchor and rope which I will toss over to the bitcoin boat and will be standing on the deck preparing to jump the ship when the dollarboat really starts to capsize. 
The sad thing is that many people will not be able to make it onto the bitcoin boat in time, some due to pure unluck, others because they were unknowing.. But the saddest part is that a few will miss their moment because they are stuck on the dollar ship collecting dollars.

Okej, now that I think about it ledger will reset itself after three failed attempts

Do you have a link to a interview with a central banker? would love to watch that..

Great, so instead of doing fractional-reserve banking in fiat they could do it in cryptocurrency instead? The reason I'm transitioning to bitcoin is to get rid of these banks
