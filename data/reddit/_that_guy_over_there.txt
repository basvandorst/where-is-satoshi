Sometimes you can tell. I knew my cousin was gay when he was 4. Now that he’s an adult he calls himself “bitch” because he’s fierce.

That was my response as well.

Did you make it?

Im sure if you went back over this sub’s history you’d find a handful of “prophetic” predictions just like this one. When thousands of people throw numbers out someone is bound to get lucky sometimes.

I need to calm down, someone tell me that Bitcoin is dead.
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:30:00
I guarantee you with 100% certainty that it either will or will not happen.

Bingo. My car has been scuffed multiple times in parking garages and recently nicely dented as well. The bad boy has 140,000 miles, like hell I’m repairing the damage. Much better to invest, save, or stack more sats.

1) they’re not as useful as nuclear power. 
2) you can’t convert them into weapons.

Bitcoin will hit 10k sometime before the heat death of the universe. 
Look who just outfoxed who.

Nobody went to jail last time so why would this be any different? Too big to fail will be trotted back out under the guise of saving jobs and we’ll be right back to square one. 
The question is when.

Mine was a dream that I woke up and we were down to $96. Waking up again was a definite relief.

Can you do me a favor and bet against BTC real quick?

I think this is much more likely than BYC subverting fiat. If governments no longer have control over issues currency they would lose a tremendous amount of power. While I’m sure most of the people on this sub think that’s a good thing I don’t see that happening without a massive fight. The idea that the US or EU wouldn’t go full on cyber warfare to maintain that control and power doesn’t seem reasonable to me.
