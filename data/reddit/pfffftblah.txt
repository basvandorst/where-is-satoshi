bitcoin ... a virtual item with properties that only a virtual item can have ... nobody forcing anyone to use it as a currency ... you can hold forever .... frame your paper wallet and hang it on the wall ... you could delete your keys or burn your paper wallet ... and it doesnt matter
if you want to use it as a currency go ahead
if its not important then why do they keep bringing it up?  there is lots of other shit they could bitch about
that older 100 dollar bill i kept for the last 30 years cause i thought it looked cool ... buying power gone ... should have spent it asap
virtual currencies and items have existed for years before anyone uttered the word bitcoin (airmiles?)... its nothing new except in that bitcoin is much better ... ask any gamer
anyone that utters tulip and bitcoin in the same speech just crawled out from under some rock
i compared it to tulips when i first thought about it, you did too admit it, so when i hear the word tulip i know im listening to a bitcoin NOOB.
Will I call a man who is much more successful that me a nubbin.  yup
seriously though.   i want to buy my coffee with bitcoin ... until that happens btc overpriced in my opinion

If bitcoin or similar cannot be destroyed by governments, or laws attempting to control have little effect, then governments will have to adapt to it.
In my opinion bitcoin will be loved by governments.  Every transaction you make is written for all to see on the blockchain.  My real name is linked to bitcoin addresses by my activities on an exchange.  I am completely exposed.  Cash feels much better to use than bitcoin.
If I were you I would research coins that were designed from the ground up to be anonymous or research whether bitcoin can be used anonymously.  Maybe it can be idk.  That is something I am unclear on.
Here are a couple coins that I think have varying degrees of anonymity.
Zcash, Monero (my fav just because I have some and tried it out a bit), Dash (not sure about this one)

My example of the huge differences in how generations of people all alive at the same time in the same place have experienced life.  I apologize ... I just couldnt hold it in any more.
I pooped in a hole in the ground with a little shack over it for the first 14 years of my life.
My father pooped in a hole for the first 34 years of his life.
His father pooped in a hole for his entire life.
My son pooped in his pants for the first 4 years of his life (stubborn kid).

so that was something like 25% fee i think
i minus $2.50 for blockchain transaction then divide $47.50 by $38 = 1.25
make sure the wallet you are using is showing the value in usd and not some other country's dollars
the atm should show you what they are charging or paying for one bitcoin....so take that number...say they charging you $4500 per bitcoin and you know that the current average value is $4240...then divide $4500 by $4240 and you get 1.0613 or 6.13%
in my area the atms are charging 8% so in my opinion you got hosed and you should look for better sources

i bought in at 1200 and a little while later this happened
"It is official. The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) denied the Winklevoss twins’ Bitcoin ETF COIN on March 10.
"Almost immediately after the public statement from the SEC was released to the public, Bitcoin price plunged, from $1,350 to $980 within seconds."
in my noob panic i reduced my bitcoin holdings by 8% in just a couple clicks...i then walked away from my pc and told myself if this was all the spine i had i may as well sell
thats when i mastered the "Skill of the Unflinching Hold"
im looking to add the "Skill of Selling the Dump" to my skill set
cause it seems to happen the same every time .... 3 groups of sellers during a dump 1)those selling for a reason which initiates the dump in the first place 2)those selling because they invested money they shouldn't have and are shitting their pants 3)those who realize the dump is happening and sell so as to buy back in cheaper
so the correction ends up 3 times bigger than it really is ... if that little theory is correct then a dump should return 2/3 of the dump
its fun to write stuff on the internet! dont listen to me im a nub

Something I like about fiat...
New people can be brought into the fiat economy easily.  When you are a part of the fiat economy you are a part of the fiat network.  Network effect.  Isnt that a thing that bitcoiners like to talk about?
Anyone not a part of the fiat network can simply be given some fiat thereby bringing them into and making them a part of the fiat network.  More fiat is created which takes a tiny bit of wealth from each person already in the fiat network and transfers it to the person that the new fiat was just given to.
How is this to be done with Bitcoin?  Are those who do not possess Bitcoin going to be content being our man servants and pool boys?  Or will they line us up against the wall?
How will outsiders be brought into the Bitcoin Network?  Via Bitcoin taxes maybe.  Governments may get into mining as a means of getting bitcoin.  Miners may be taxed of their Bitcoin rewards.  I guess it could be done then.
Perhaps a country will make it illegal and painful for its citizens to use Bitcoin.  Maybe the government itself will use Bitcoin but run fiat for its citizens.
Im so far out of my depth here its not even funny.  Or is it?  Idk

bitcoin is a new form of item
nobody forcing anyone to use it or possess it but they are!

I have made 35 $2000 withdraws over the past 6 months.
  One time they held my withdraw up for review for 17 hours, i made a ticket and they responded that i should get 2fa.   I did not get 2fa, marked the ticket as resolved and they never bothered me again.  I did later enable 2fa.
I cannot comment on verification.

I was wondering this morning if efforts to keep a countries currency away from bitcoin would have the effect of forcing bitcoin to be used as currency in its own right.  Without this exchanging back and forth to fiat.

In war some of those involved may find the infrastructure that bitcoin runs on destroyed.  Only those who have agents with access to their bitcoin outside of the devastated country will be able to continue spending it.  Perhaps spending it on supplies that are sent home such as weapons or food and medicine.  Any addresses suspected of belonging to the enemy will be blacklisted and those accepting payments from those addresses will be punished.
A larger war or a world war will most likely devastate bitcoin and render it useless and worthless.
In my opinion bitcoin hinges on world peace.  If the day comes when bitcoin is widely used in all nations it may be counterproductive to engage in a war which would damage a country's ability to participate in bitcoin.
Bitcoin may become a tactical target of some sort.

i now have an interest in defending bitcoin even if i dont admit it ... if you are not involved yet you are probably one of the best people to look at it critically
think about it .... look at all the coins and decide for yourself what you think is best
what i like about bitcoin:
public blockchain, it leaves a permanent trail for law enforcement ... a country could make it preferable for its citizens to use bitcoin wallets that link their real identities to their addresses
do i like that?  well i think a country would like that. a country liking that would help in bitcoin being accepted by governments

ive dealt directly with the owners of the atms in my area .... i went and met them in their physical office and did a face to face
if you dont mind paying them 5-6%
and they might prefer you use the atm for small amounts...but if they not too busy they prob see you for small amount and talk crypto with you like a good salesman does
so i called him up .... then drove the three hours to his city and we did the transaction in his office...to finalize the transaction took about 15 minutes ... but i was there for an hour while he enthusiastically talked crypto

Here is in article that seems to be advocating saving and not spending everything...
You are asking why some people are not spending any of their Hodlings.  Well then...your question is not directed at me in that case.  In my case not trying to trade dips and rises worked out for me.  I had purchased 13 bitcoins in Feb 2017 and after a couple small trades where I did make money I came to the realization that I would have made about 50 times more if I had simply held (I'm looking at you Dash... and you XRP).  That is when I became a 1% trader and 99% holder.  Having lucked out on the 2017 spring pump I was now, in June 2017, holding 46 bitcoins instead of my original 13.  I then sold 20 of those bitcoins to finish paying off my house.  Awesome feeling.
So... 20/46 that makes me a 56% holder ... but since I only trade 1% of the time I like to consider myself a 99% holder.
If I had held on a little longer I could have paid off my house with $4900/bitcoin instead of $2600/bitcoin.  But that is ok.  I dont guess dips and rises and owning my home was too big a prize and would benefit my family too much to chance.
The bank would not take my bitcoin (I didnt ask actually but I assumed no).  I found a bitcoin broker, sold them for a fee of about 6%, and happily deposited my check in the bank.  My bank knows exactly where the money came from.  They are the ones who wrote me the bank draft made out to my local bitcoin merchant in February.  The tax man gets his cut soon.
So did I buy and sell stuff?  mmm I bought and sold alts ... I bought the remainder of my mortgage ... and I bought my kids a sweet gaming pc.
the original 13 bitcoin were purchased with money I had ... I did not run out and max my credit cards
excellent troll on your part.
