They haven't shown it to be faster than a regular computer so who cares what they're calling it.

I have little doubt quantum computing will eventually arrive. My issue is with D-Wave and Geordie Rose in particular. 
If you want an airplane analogy just imagine Geordie Rose running around with wings glued to his arms and flapping them really fast. Ignoring scientists trying to explain to him that  humans simply don't have the upper-body strength to do that. Trying to prove he can fly he jumps off a cliff and afterwards triumphantly declares himself the first man to achieve heavier than air flight. After people explaining to him that he pretty much fell straight down he defends himself with it being early technology and next year he'll come back with bigger and better wings and use even more glue. 
And so it went. Year after year he'd come back with bigger and better wings and, yes, more glue. And he did indeed make progress and land a little further from the bottom of the cliff. Research papers would be written about how impressive those wings are, because, well, they were impressive. And he got people to invest in his big beautiful wings. Sure, he hadn't technically flown yet, but nobody else had either and look at all the progress he's making.  
Rose's problem here is that the physics behind what he's trying to make simply doesn't work. Can physicists "prove" it will never work? No, but they can give pretty solid arguments for why not.

No, my issue is with D-Wave. The rest (at least most of) are out at Kitty Hawk.

Taking less time to complete the calculation. We can include "and/or better approximations" if they're approximating a solution rather than solving it.

There's no way to make mining quantum resistant.

1. SHA-256 is not an encryption method.
2. Quantum computers aren't known to break SHA-256.
3. The world is indeed working on replacements for the forms of encryption that quantum computers can break, but that doesn't mean all public keys for bitcoins will automatically switch to them.

You certainly make some great points.

Solve all of BQP efficiently.

No, there isn't.

Not how quantum computers work. It's more like, in some specific cases, a quantum computer can put the hidden ball in the right box and then open it. But it *really* depends on the ball and it does take time to put the ball in the right box before it can open it.

It effectively cuts the key length in half. In theory. How this will work out in practice is yet to be seen, but it's not implausible that in the long run, you'll need a quantum computer to mine Bitcoin.

That's still true, because your post is not the top post. There are about 4 other posts within the last month.

I meant more generally for quantum algorithms. For Grover's algorithm it doesn't matter what's in the box, but it takes a really long time to put it in the right box. Not as long as looking through all the boxes, but still a long time.

Cryptographic hashes aren't exactly untouched. Grover's algorithm reduces the complexity to the square root of the classical complexity. So for breaking SHA256 it's theoretically 2^128 = 340282366920938463463374607431768211456 times faster in terms of complexity. So that's not nothing, but I'd agree breaking SHA256 still won't be possible.

If so, then not intentionally. [There are many examples]( in modern cryptography where no amount of computational resources will let you break it. It's two different categories of security.

No. With **any** amount of computing power it's certainly possible. It's just not feasible to get that much computing power.
