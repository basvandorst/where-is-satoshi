1. She thinks being finite is a bad thing.... WRONG
2. He (the expert) says it's not finite.... WRONG
I'm laying my BTC 'case' on the bed for another long rest!!

As Andreas says, it should be regarded as a new class - somewhere between currency and commodity, at least as far as regulation/tax is concerned. This writer needs to wake up and smell the coffee!

Ledgerwallet let me create a new compartment 'Split' for BCH. I copied it's receiving address and sent to it from the 'Main' BCH. All this is on the new Bitcoincash blockchain - selectable on the app.

I'm hoping to find an Ethereum contract provider to sort this one out

If BTC held on Polo, can't we transfer it to USDT during dodgy period?
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:04:56
I do both :-)

Poloniex is easy to use yet very comprehensive. No I.D. needed. Lending easy, so always make money independent of price fluctuations. Exchanging between currencies frictionless.

On a hardware wallet is the safest storage, such as Ledgerwallet. Problem there though is the waiting times. Mobile wallets are safer generally than pc's. Jaxx is great in my view.

I totally advocate the personal wallet storage point, but if BTC is exchanged into ETH, say on Poloniex, would this safeguard the value during BTC fork period?

Well Coinbase is possibly better on reviews, to be honest I'm not sure if it's better in the whole. Polo isn't so regulated (or in the regulators' radar). I've had no issues transferring in or out, lending, exchanging currencies over the last 3-4 months.

If it's just a wallet you need then Jaxx on mobile is great. I use it and Andreas A recommends it too. My main source of info and price though is Coindesk.

Poloniex is where you can sell high for USDT and re-buy back low, if that's what you mean.
