I withdrew from coinbase to gdax after trying to verify my ID 5 times last week.  From GDAX i sent to my own wallet where the rest of my coins were.  You don't own anything if you dont have the keys.

So, you plan to retire in 8 years. Estimate you need 1m to retire or in other words you need to save/invest 125,000/year.  With 25% of your salary going to invest you will have to have a salary of 500,000/year.  
If you have kind of scratch and do not have a financial advisor I really hope you are blowing smoke.  If you do, more power to ya and congrats and good luck.
Good luck.

I bought at 2800 also.  But I also sold at 2950 so no big deal.
