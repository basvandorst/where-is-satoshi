I would hope not.. :/ unfortunately I don't know anyone able to make things like this.
they also have an option for 2-of-2 multi sig making them trustless, seems like a nice option ��

you have my attention... honestly never heard of cold bit, it looks promising. going to have to watch some youtube, I don't understand how you would stamp it? thanks for the response!
@_date: 2019-07-17 02:01:59

from what i understand, it’s not necessarily beneficial to the network, but more for you to verify your own transactions.
for most people it’s unnecessary, there’s already enough nodes for the network to be redundant so it doesn’t really benefit the network much. if you want to gather statistics on the network, connect your own wallet, have no intermediary and full control of your own funds then, yeah. without it wallets end up querying some 3rd party server for balance and history. some people want the extra privacy.
edit: for 99% of people including myself a ledger, trezor, or cold storage is plenty.

very true. i can understand why some people don’t like it. even i dislike it sometimes, and i love weed.
i just don’t get why he smoked if he doesn’t like it so much lol.
@_date: 2019-12-25 06:34:02
did anyone watch this whole thing? he was kind of a dick about it after saying it’s unproductive and he “didn’t actually inhale”. lol
anyway, hope everyone has a good christmas!

this is unsettling...

 1. that’s entirely unrealistic. you think coinbase is going to double spend you? 
2. again, that doesn’t matter unless your rich or paranoid. and even then it’s opinion.
3. that’s a valid concern. but, there’s cold storage. as well as being able to choose where to move your coins BEFORE the fork. i promise you will have plenty of notice if btc forks again. most providers will remain on the original chain, and if not, well you have those coins on BOTH chains. 
Ex. btc vs bch, both are very widely supported after the fork. you have coins on both. congrats. 
btc vs bsv or the numerous others, you would have had to move those coins somewhere that will support both chains after the fork IF you want both coins. if not, ignore it. you will still have your original btc worst case scenario. 
4. if a 51% attack were to be even close to happening, it would be posted all over the place. it was before. i promise you will know and people will tell you what you need to do.
much love mate, i just disagree.

@_date: 2019-12-23 18:55:39

this is a redditor for 6 years type of comment
@_date: 2019-12-23 23:30:54
true. but honestly, i’m just not worried about that.  it’s not like i’m a millionaire or anything.
@_date: 2019-12-12 00:40:34
@_date: 2019-12-12 00:40:04
they used to accept credit cards. now they don’t, so people go to coinbase.
@_date: 2019-12-08 23:30:30
this is wholesome. i love christmas stuff
@_date: 2019-12-12 00:04:32
i was never a fan... i’m just surprised at the collective attitude that btc has been “hijacked” and they’re “saving it” with bch..
