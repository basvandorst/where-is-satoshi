Me and two other friends are studying at a college in Maryland and we are given $825 monthly allowance each for rent, food, etc not including tuition fees. Three of us rented a studio, costs $1475 plus $100 for utilities per month, so each one of us pays about $525 per month for a one year lease. One of us had to leave in January 2017 as I recalled , leaving me and another friend and we had to pay about $800 each for the rest of the lease. And we could not afford to pay in full about $1575 per month. For sure, warning letters came and at last we got court notice twice, March 31 and April 17. I went to the court for trial and explained our circumstances to the judge and the the attorney for the apartment and paid what we could afford. The total sums we have to pay is about $10000 for February until July plus court fees. After the eviction, i move to my friend house and paid some money to them but i know someday, i have to move out.
     As long as I have been here, I never did part time job because under university policy, all jobs are prioritized for students who get financial aid from the university, so it was quite hard in the beginning.  For me, I bought bitcoin after an extended search for additional incomes, it brought me to bitcoin. I first bought in December 2016 when it was value at around $700 and bought and trade from time to time. Long story short, i live my live on bitcoin but still, i could not afford to pay the debts to the rental apartment company. Because of this, my credit score has been affected and so is my life.

No apartment offers 3 people to live in a studio. Even my friend that left lived the illegally.

Hmmm how about donation to somebody who has due rents and possibly facing eviction? It is really a long story.
