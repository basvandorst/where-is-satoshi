Negligence maybe but that's not fraud. Fraud requires intent and him being too stupid isn't intending to defraud.
@_date: 2014-03-24 07:22:25
At least they're honest!
@_date: 2014-10-17 07:10:02
Or already require but they didn't do.
@_date: 2014-11-25 17:02:27
Because incompetence is not a crime. He probably just forgot to make a back up of the private keys and here we are. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:03:08
Find a couple of depositors and follow the chain. The coins should go somewhere.
@_date: 2014-05-23 21:36:00
Create an exchange that trades Bitstamp locked-in BTC for non-Bitstamp BTC. If there's concerns, people will pay a discounted rate for it.
@_date: 2014-07-18 19:21:41
It's standard abandoned property escheats to the state policy.
@_date: 2014-03-10 18:18:33
[FinCEN regulations]( that's the problem. Mere acceptance is enough to put you under the full regulatory authority.

I think it was mooncoin and some others. Changing to a immediately changing difficulty rather than per # blocks.
@_date: 2014-01-06 08:24:06
That's like saying hidden Swiss bank accounts "create some interesting questions." No, it doesn't. You have to legally report your income. If you choose to hide it using bitcoins, fine but that's nothing new in terms of "government" outreach.
@_date: 2014-10-28 17:12:56
And then to collapse
@_date: 2014-03-10 04:15:53
Yeah but we should just have one and get to the point. Have it do like 99.9% given out in the first month and then 0.01% for eternity. The pumping will make Auroracoin look sane.
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:39:27
No, they put warnings up but that doesn't mean people change it in their wallets.
@_date: 2014-10-24 02:49:51
Really? You're going to go with the "this is good for Bitcoin" routine? 
@_date: 2014-11-14 18:59:48
Sounds like politics 
@_date: 2014-09-28 09:16:49
It's not irrational unless you are selling bitcoin immediately until USD. Otherwise, the current price means nothing compared to your projections about the price.
@_date: 2014-02-16 07:57:18
If you tell people you have a screw up because people are exploiting a known bug that's been disclosed for *years*, I'm not entirely confident that they will be *willing* and able to pay out.
@_date: 2014-02-16 07:47:57
Yeah, nobody *ever* halts deposits.
@_date: 2014-03-29 18:42:35
Enjoy the IRS capital gains taxes you're going to be hit with. Make sure you have at least 15% set aside.
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:48:56
Because they need something to pump up the value
@_date: 2014-02-16 07:54:45
It's creative destruction of the bitcoin exchange businesses. Always messy but necessary.
@_date: 2014-10-17 07:11:18
You can't trade them off the exchange and it takes time and transaction costs to move back and forth.
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:26:37
Go ahead and try to explain the technical difference of "there's a link to the contents of a website that contains kiddy porn in the bitcoin blockchain" and "bitcoin supports kiddy porn" once the media gets ahold of it.
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:39:49
And even then, just collect that fee anyways.
@_date: 2014-04-07 19:27:08
That and the other half of it is like Kickstarter
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:41:50
wow such hatred. so many downvotes for a poor little bot.
@_date: 2014-11-25 09:39:00
The link must go somewhere 
@_date: 2014-05-23 21:33:31
Better yet, create a credit default swap. An exchange that trades BTC on Bitstamp for BTC off Bitstamp. If people here really are convinced that it'll collapse, then put money into it.
@_date: 2014-01-15 10:22:18
Once you start with "an entity with unlimited resources", you can go pretty much anywhere with it.
@_date: 2014-12-23 21:26:49
That's my point. If they included changetip for the payment method, it would be marketing it. Everyone just needs to send a dollar that way.
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:52:00
Reddit gold is given away quietly. Send the tips via pm if you want.
@_date: 2014-01-25 08:13:11
You shouldn't bother to come to any reddit meetup.
@_date: 2014-12-23 21:12:42
It would be cool if it used changetip as well.
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:18:34
It's not illegal everywhere.
@_date: 2014-09-29 22:18:21
We're discussing the irrationality of miners I presume so I take it as a given that the person already had taken on the risk of buying and order the equipment, a sunk cost, and so their only analysis is the small marginal depreciation and electricity cost in mining which would require huge pessimism about the price.
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:23:12
It great for options traders above all.
@_date: 2014-09-09 23:11:14
Until someone hires an assassin or something, Silk Road style.
@_date: 2014-11-24 03:29:52
Well then I stand corrected.
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:50:07
Or people could just the private tag
@_date: 2014-11-25 09:48:35
Except they aren't selling equity anywhere just a product that's fraudulent. The FTC would be the right agency as you can't point to a security
@_date: 2014-10-20 00:58:23
Or $.37
@_date: 2014-03-10 02:43:14
Other than the IRS and US financial authorities getting on their case for some things related to "terrorism" or "money laundering."
@_date: 2015-08-10 15:53:06
OP is the idea guy.
@_date: 2015-07-27 11:23:12
Sold out
@_date: 2015-07-31 10:28:43
So a bubble? We need tulip bulbs to celebrate.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:45:58
More than you have.
@_date: 2013-12-30 04:11:29
Why not create your own site, charge less than everyone else and take the market? That's more effective than complaining about other people's prices.
@_date: 2013-12-21 08:32:03
Debit cards don't work that way. That's closer to what bitcoins are.
@_date: 2013-12-30 04:10:30


Why? They raised their prices. You disagree, go somewhere else. What's this ranting supposed to accomplish? You think they'll just say 'you know what, that guy is right, let's set the prices back to the way it was.'
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:45:18
You'd still want to diversify.
