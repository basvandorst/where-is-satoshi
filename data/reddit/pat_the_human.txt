I don't know if I agree with his statement. He claims two points:
1) "Starting" a currency is very difficult unless you have a country backing it. He points out San Francisco as a former city which tried the same process with commodity bartering such as gold and other precious metals. I believe this is false because S.F. is completely sheltered in on it's self, with no breathing room for outside cities. The internet on the other hand contains many economies with people around the world (some 100,000+ in count) rooting for BitCoin. This gives plenty of breathing room for more people to join the currency if they wish.
2) He "can't just walk into a grocery store and buy groceries." I believe this is false because there are plenty of peer to peer transactions going on in many places around the world. Bars, mobile carts, etc. Why can't a grocery store set the same process up? It's really not difficult and merely requires a push in the right direction from a bitcoin advocate.

Your faggotry ruins this subreddit. Pissoff.

It's making bitcoin"more legitimate" by putting a face to the name. The more places you see bitcoin being accepted, the more comfortable individuals become with it. They're using bitcoin perfectly by bypassing huge bank and online processing fees. It's their choice whether or not they want to keep bitcoin in their pocket, just like it's your choice to decide whether or not you want to buy into bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-21 06:42:55
this is fucking stupid honestly
@_date: 2014-01-12 01:30:38
