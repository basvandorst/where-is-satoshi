I sold all my alts into btc, bought doge and now I'm out after a five day pending on LTC and dash. The doge was withdrawn in under an hour.

If you want to attract people, put a big fucking Bitcoin logo on it.

In Canada charging a fee for debit is illegal but I understand why small retailers do it.

Bought my first bitcoin there for like 25 bucks. Felt like a drug deal.

My local bank RBC manager who follows Bitcoin told me last week that they received a memo that they were not to touch anything connected to Bitcoin.

Shit, that's a lot of money. I'm curious, why didn't you just hold? Also, does this loss seriously affect your income or are u already well off? Do tho have a SO, and did you tell them? What was there reaction?

I never understood the alt coin hate. I've made $$ mining and trading them. Doge coin has introduced crypto to lots of otherwise uninterested ppl.

Bless you.

Could you answer a question for me and I apologize if it sounds ridiculous: Is it fine to not split Bitcoin Cash from my BTC wallet or  will this at some point not be possible and the Bitcoin Cash will be lost? I don’t really understand crypto at this level.

This is solid advice. I can't believe how much these pre-orders are going for on eBay. As someone who has a pre-order with BFL, not only would I not bid on these items but am seriously considering my state of mind at the time when I pre-ordered an ASIC from BFL to begin with. Bitcoin is one hell of a drug.
