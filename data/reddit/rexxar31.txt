That was sick setup. Mining really is not profitable anymore. RIP to those 1070s. ����

FUD bro. Do you bought some at 20k?
@_date: 2018-09-20 03:22:09
There are many alternatives that offer cheaper prices than your app depending on your country. GDAX is I think offer free trades when you use limit orders (CMIIW, gdax is not available in our country). I came from Philippines and we have Coins Pro which has a fee of 0.25% of your total order.

Can you put those "jewelries" around your neck too?
@_date: 2018-09-11 02:19:34
well then thanks to the time warp bug LOL
@_date: 2018-09-11 02:14:10
That pretty seems right.

Some are saying that they are from the Silk Road which are inactive for 4y.
@_date: 2018-09-18 02:21:34
I stand corrected. ��
@_date: 2018-09-06 03:55:40
oh crap!
@_date: 2018-09-10 06:42:42
Yes. But a single entity get a hold of your personal information with your IDs etc. Hack it and you can be anyone on the internet.
@_date: 2018-09-10 03:17:24
not working.
@_date: 2018-09-10 03:24:55
Coinbase will be your friend.
@_date: 2018-09-04 07:15:22
Of course they would surely settle in a currency that would never be affected by hyperinflation caused by governments and banks.

Based on your description, the only reason you profited is because from August - December 2017 it is a bull market. From January 'till now its bear so you lost everything you've gained. A good trader can profit even if the market is bull or bear. If you're not a good trader, please HODL or you will just lose more money in this type of market.
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:15:19
Right. I'm planning to buy some BTCs last week. Really glad to hold my horses LOL.
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:43:46
so the whales in the buy side can't stop the whales on the sell side? or maybe they are an organization and there really are not whales on the buy side. The ones we see are just to trick the people to buy because there *seems* to have a wall.
@_date: 2018-09-10 03:09:04
as of now, what I can see is how BTC price respects support and resistance lines. Anything than that like trend lines or MA's is not reliable for me.
@_date: 2018-09-11 05:22:28
its gone. Sorry to hear that.
@_date: 2018-09-10 02:11:25
Can't still believe in TA for BTC right now. Apparently, the news / media still controls the price movement. Too ironic when people always look at the charts but when they saw a bad news they sell. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 01:44:46
Bitcoin really is seen as store of value nowadays.
@_date: 2018-09-09 01:49:17
did I read it right? Cryptocurrency expert Warren Buffet? 
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:03:18
I'm sorry, but for me, I think its not a good momentum. BTC, yes, is going up slowly over the days but does it feels a little weird that it goes up slowly knowing that it fluctuates heavily every single day. I really see this one coming. They are setting the bulls up.
@_date: 2018-09-19 02:17:12
Good for beginners. Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2018-09-19 06:21:53
Go for Ledger Wallet. It supports more coins than any other competitors. Also by what you mean shitcoins, are they ERC20 tokens? If yes then you can also store them in the Ledger. For you reference about the supported coins of the Ledger please look here [

The main goal of BTC is to be a currency that will be adopted by many, decentralized, and will never be affected by inflation. If you are asking what other aspects or possibilities can bitcoin do beside being just a currency, I think your statement would self destruct. 
@_date: 2018-09-18 02:17:58
BCH fanboys. LOOOL
@_date: 2018-09-10 00:12:32
SEC tweeting about crypto on Sunday. Too normal..
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:21:04
I'm not afraid. I don't have any positions when this go boom but right now I have. Lets go loooooooonng!! 
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:33:18
Where is that 100m Tether passed to Bitfinex last 2 days? Haven't felt the pump LOL.
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:24:14
Its just funny that when news posted something like Bitcoin is bullish right now, the next day or sooner, it will dump. LOOOOL
@_date: 2018-09-09 01:14:23
BTC price falling will not stop just because you're awake LOL.
@_date: 2018-09-09 03:15:43
me neither.
@_date: 2018-09-12 05:45:09
wow. your comment makes you look more stupid. :O
@_date: 2018-09-09 01:13:10
This is a short but very informative video. Thanks for sharing mate!
@_date: 2018-09-04 07:05:22
Tell your wife it will pay for itself one day. LOOL
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:23:08
I am also a believer in BTC even though there are some technologies that are far better than BTC has. But it proves itself for many years so yes, it will moon sooner or later. :D
@_date: 2018-09-10 04:01:34
Pundi X is already doing a good job on this.
@_date: 2018-09-09 01:04:09
Adding fiat in progress... please wait...
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:45:21
that guy really focused on observing who's getting **REKT.** LOOOOOL
@_date: 2018-09-20 03:19:55
If we think for another scenario, OKex would still benefit long term even if they are giving away their own money to their consumers. Happy Friday is a long-term program but if there are more and more people participate the said program, the money they are getting on their own pocket will become less and less and if the time comes that they don't have to run the program anymore, the profit they will be getting will be doubled compared to if they won't run the program. Sometimes you have to sacrifice for a long time to benefit for a longer time.

sideways perhaps?
