u/Pineapplefund Check out a Glimmer of Hope!  (I actually approached their foundation about investing in crypto-assets.) It's exactly the type of organization you're looking for.

Sounds like you're proposing avoiding taxes...  Or how would you go about paying those?

Is it good all the miner's get their rewards cut in half May 2020?

This is an interesting topic… 
When we have a stronger dollar,  we don't pay taxes on the the implied gains...
Would each purchase made with bitcoins need to be compared the purchase price of those bitcoins and assessed capital gains?  That's ridiculous… 
It's a tricky subject to say the least…

I thought Bitcoin was just a store of value now...  Figured people gave up on using it for payments due to high fees, slow transaction times.

Ironically , BBVA has possibly the worst banking website I've ever used...  Seriously horrible user experience.

Would have been nice to take out half now, and half in 2018 splitting the tax burden across two years and probably significantly lowering that tax bill.
Then again who knows what will happen to bitcoin prices between now and the end of the year.

Open Bazaar is running a promotion right now!  Use OB2TURNS1 for a 25% discount on tons of items using BTC.

Really a shame people are wasting their time learning charting and TA.  Unless of course he is implying that folks are finally realizing charting and TA are a complete waste of time, in which case it is indeed a phenomenal form of education for the younger crowd.

Come May 2020, transaction fees will likely go up ~ $60,000 every block to compensate for lost inflation reward.
We'll all be paying more than $300k extra in fees every hour.

I have a goofy side biz.  I'm changing payment system from PayPal to Stripe and one of the reasons is to accept bitcoins.
New site will probably be up next week.

What the heck is signalling?  Is that like mining?  I have a super fast PC just sitting here....
