That’s called bankruptcy bro and you fuck yourself over in the process. Lenders aren’t just giving out free money lol
@_date: 2019-05-04 14:02:27
You’re talking yourselves in circles dude. You literally do not know what you’re talking about.

Clearly it is for you if you had to take out a loan lol and that’s called bankruptcy not a write-off. You don’t get to write off a $70,000 loan on your taxes at the end of the year and your liability is just gone. You really don’t know what you’re talking about.

Sure lol

You’re honestly retarded.
@_date: 2019-05-04 13:53:14
Bro it doesn’t work like that. I’m not sure what else to tell you lol. You’re going to get yourself into trouble or lose all your money taking out loans when you don’t even understand what a write-off even is.

I’m honestly am surprised that anybody thinks this is realistic any time soon.
@_date: 2019-05-04 13:59:49
Because you don’t even know basic tax law. That’s why I’m saying that. You literally don’t even know what a write-off is. You’re talking about a lender write-off, which the lender will only do usually when you declare bankruptcy and destroy your financial health in the process lol. Way different than a write-off you do on your taxes. Good luck on your taxes next year lol

There is plenty of risk. I’m not sure you even know what a write-off is or if you are talking about bankruptcy but there are risks to both. Regardless, you said 2 BTC wasn’t that much yet you had to take a loan out to purchase those 2 BTC lol
