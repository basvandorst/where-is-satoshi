I hear a lot about cryptocurrencies lately in class (18-19 yo people) even though it's not always about BTC
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:13:39
Cool that they used it back then :)

Looks like a Yubikey?

Various open source projects would really appreciate a few k's ;) Solus Project, KDE, GNOME, Krita. I believe they should be non-profits.
Edit: Wine and ReactOS would also really deserve it :)

Still 1 year and 34 weeks behind (I downloaded the bootstrap.dat (from 2014) via torrent and it is still importing from disk)... This takes forever... :/ EDIT: 13:30 GMT+1, still 1 year and 9 weeks behind, now syncing with the network...

1. There's no currency called Bitcoin Core. Core is a piece of software.
2. Just like some people like one party on politics, some like Bitcoin and some like Bitcoin Cash. is Pro-Bitcoin and is Pro-Bitcoin Cash. Both claim that their currency is better :D
But I think Google will be able to answer your questions pretty well.
I myself own also Bitcoin Cash because of the fork but I have only bought Bitcoin since then. So I like the "original Bitcoin" more :)

Do you know about mjam? I mostly use them when I order food online.

You have to imagine, that it drives much faster forward than backwards then you can kinda see it.

I wouldn't recommend the RPi 1/2 at all. Either if you are low budget / don't need more, get the RPi Zero, otherwise get the RPi 3.
@_date: 2016-07-19 16:19:45
But why would you want to purchase the RPi 2 instead of the RPi 3?
@_date: 2016-07-19 15:14:24
If you already have a Pi, use it. But don't buy a NEW 1/2.
