Yes, that might be a clever idea. Personally, I would look at :
* Mixing coins such as FedoraCoin or XCurrency.
* Dash (formerly known as Darkcoin).
* Cloakcoin.
* Or even better Cryptonote implementations such as Monero or Bytecoin.

Zerocoin is a cryptographic extension of Bitcoin in the way that it is a modified version of the Bitcoin Protocol. It uses the same blockchain. If you want to know how it work in details, you can read the [Zerocoin Paper](

Why not moving the date to September 1? August 1 seems too early for a lot of people and it only gives 4 months.

In 2013, Ian Miers, Christina Garmanm Natthew Green and Aviel D. Rubin from John Hopkins University proposed a new protocol on top of the Bitcoin protocol called **Zerocoin**. It's a cryptographic extension to Bitcoin in order to allow fully anonymous transactions.
**Zerocash**, announced in 2014, was created by the Zerocoin's research team. Following the idea of Zerocoin, Zerocash is a complete new cryptocurrency which is designed to fix some of the flaws in Zerocoin such as visible payment destination and amount.
Feel free to ask any questions about it and I will do my best to answer them.

You should change in line 54 branch from "0.14/UASF" to "v0.14.0.uasfsegwit".

You should look directly at node with "UASF"

Yes it signals itself as "Satoshi BIP148 0.14"
@_date: 2016-01-21 19:18:07
Actually DASH and Monero are Cryptonote's implementations.
@_date: 2017-03-26 15:02:20
You can search for "UASF" and "BIP148" since the version string has been updated.
@_date: 2016-01-21 15:31:43
Hi fellow Montrealer,
AFAIK, Zerocoin does not hide payment destination and amount, Zerocash does.
Zerocoin is also computationally expensive (because of a 3,072-bit RSA accumulators).


What do you mean by CT ? Coinjoin need a trusted third party to work. A *better* alternative would be [CoinShuffle](
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:13:16
You should update tag name to "v0.14.0.uasfsegwit".

There is a lot of interesting news in the Bitcoin space. This is just childish and uninteresting.

Very bad explanation actually.

No one fork until economic majority is behind. Moreover, Bitcoin is perfectly working right, we can wait. Segwit will activate one day or another or we will find another scaling solution.
@_date: 2017-04-04 22:54:59
Look, in the case of a UASF, Jihan said he will hard fork to bigger block. I'm not so worried. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 22:33:48
So you are okay with mining centralization ?
You think user should not be able to participate in any change ?
@_date: 2017-04-04 21:19:50
Also, it's not about the number of nodes at all. Please read BIP148 again.

Okay, you seems in denial. Look at this:

@_date: 2017-04-04 21:36:35
Only economic nodes are necessary.
@_date: 2017-04-04 21:46:07
So let's not try at least huh so we can move forward ? Majority of user want segwit.
@_date: 2017-04-04 20:45:35
The code is not even finished 
@_date: 2017-04-04 12:58:10
I don't think UASF need a Twitter account sorry.
@_date: 2017-04-04 18:19:20
Excellent news, once he leaves we can activate segwit.
@_date: 2017-04-04 20:59:15
No. These people are basically just signaling. And no fork will happens until economic majority approves it. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 21:17:53
I have no doubt that without economic majority behind it they will switch back to Core otherwise it will be a super boring fork (i.e. nothing will happen).
Also see my comment above.

Ahah sure man.

The list is mostly accurate. However, Paycoin is a failure but above all a scam.


I completely disagree with this sentence as Paycoin's variations of blockchain (especially prime controller) only bring more centralization and inequality.

I’m referring to the implementation used by most of the BIP148 enforcing node which is 
@_date: 2017-07-10 22:35:23
I can.


Related to PR [ UASF-Segwit:1.0 nodes now have a new service bit saying that they are enforcing BIP148 (NODE_BIP148). With that, new BIP148 nodes can preferentially connect to nodes with this service bit. This reduces the partitioning risk.


Related to PR [ Means that if, after August 1, you activate the -bip148 option or if you use a biP148 enforcing client with your local copy of the blockchain it will check that after August 1 all blocks are really enforcing BIP148 rule otherwise it rewind and ask the blocks to others BIP148 nodes.


Straightforward (PR [ you can now whitelist outgoing connections instead of only being to whitelist incoming connections.


Related to PR [ Bitcoin Core normally ban nodes that broadcast invalid blocks. In this implementation, it will simply disconnect them (they can reconnect later). Useful for reorg. 


You can enable or disable bip148 by using the flag -bip148 (=1 enabled and =0 disabled)
