Something like this or one of the many smaller variants:    - to keep them clean you could use two of them - one on the asics to absorb their heat, and one in the tank to radiate it.  Separate cooling fluid running through that system means no slime in the heatsinks over time.
@_date: 2015-12-13 22:23:42
Get some cheap aluminium water cooling blocks from Aliexpress and clamp or stick them on to some asics (which are next to or under the tank), then pump water from the tank through the blocks.  When the water gets too hot, turn off the miner with a thermostat.

Thanks, that was a good read.  Do you know how Masternodes work with PoS coins?  I know they're not part of the minting process but do they have an effect on coin security?

Look into masternode coins as well, especially Crave :) You don't need to spend any money on gear or power anymore and yet it's still very profitable.

Look into masternode coins like PivX or Crave - they have excellent returns for long term holders.
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:52:35
You're correct, the returns are that good - I'm using XenServer (which is free) to split up the PC into smaller pieces  and running one node on each instance of Ubuntu.  
I'm running other coins as well, either staking or noding, and right now I'm making quite a good income doing that (thanks to the high BTC price). I'm didn't buy any gear and am not spending any extra money on power that I would otherwise.  
PS: CRAVE is particularly good at this game because the nodes are relatively cheap, you can stake the rewards you get at the same time AND if you have a lot of nodes making CRAVE you can make more masternodes because you only need 500 coins.  It's pretty crazy :)
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:13:43
I don't look at it in $ terms because the BTC I used to buy the nodes didn't cost me that much in the beginning.  
I probably wouldn't consider doing this if I had to buy BTC at current rates and would just hold it instead.  Sometimes I do wonder if holding BTC would have been better than buying alts, but it does feel good to have spendable crypto without feeling like you have to re-buy it again.
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:29:52

Yes, very much so!  He wrote to the NSA back in 1955 with a revolutionary encryption technique:

There's some noise around that makes a pseudonym seem like a credible answer.  eg the comments made above  could be construed to mean that it is an alias.  And there was some other guy saying he called the department where Nick supposedly worked and they didn't know of him.  
I would be very interested in your thoughts on this, if you've gone to the trouble of verifying Nick's history you must have a clearer picture than most as to where Bitcoin came from?  Maybe you've already written about it in which case a link would be helpful, or are you more on the side of protecting the creators so the less questions are asked the better?

I think Satoshi is Nobel prize winner John Nash and Bitcoin is his vision of "Ideal Money" - 
@_date: 2015-04-28 11:19:24
I keep getting down-voted for suggesting this but until something better comes along I think Nick Szabo is one of John Nash's alter personas 
@_date: 2015-04-26 06:15:10
I believe now that Bitcoin was created at MIT (as an implementation of John Nash's concept of "Ideal Money") - so it makes sense that the core devs continue to get paid by MIT.
@_date: 2015-04-28 22:55:35
Ok thanks, I appreciate your response (and your writings in general).  I wasn't able to find that much info on him.

I think Satoshi is Nobel prize winner John Nash  and that Bitcoin is based on his idea of "Ideal Money"
@_date: 2015-04-26 09:58:56
Ok, I'm not really talking about the code as such, more the original concept.  
Before Bitcoin was even announced, what if the thinking at RAND/MIT/FED etc was  "The USD is in trouble due to public debt, massive unfunded liabilities, 600 trillion dollars in potential derivative trading losses, and soon our major trading partners will setup alternative means of trading internationally.  Let's make a global digital alternative to let us retain a form of reserve currency status in the future."   
That's a substantially different starting point than a couple of random clever people getting somewhat rich by starting their own currency.
But we don't know that, even by studying the code or re-writing it.
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:13:47
It's a valid way of making more bitcoin, why is this different to mining ETH to sell for BTC? 
@_date: 2015-04-26 09:31:59
Yes I understand that.  I guess my main concern is that Bitcoin as a whole already conforms to the intentions of it's creator, and that creator may have hidden agendas.  
For example, if it's one guy (Satoshi) sitting on 1.5 million BTC getting rich for himself that's one thing. Or what if Bitcoin is the intended successor to the USD or SDRs.  Many possibilities, not much to go on right now apart from the cool technology that Bitcoin itself is.
At the moment, the Bitcoin network is 77,000 times more powerful than the largest supercomputer in the world.  It's a serious thing, and many people are spending large amount of effort on it.
Bitcoin makes people question the hidden motivations of Fiat currency creation and that's a good thing, why not question the motivations of Bitcoin's creations as well.  
@_date: 2015-04-28 20:53:58
I've come to believe Satoshi is Nobel prize winner John Nash and Bitcoin is his vision of "Ideal Money" -   - I think it's important who made it, it's not a "write it in a weekend and give it away" kind of open source project.   Funnily enough, the free software movement started at MIT.

Run some masternodes instead - eg check out CRAVE on Cryptopia, it has 66% Block Reward per masternode roughly every minute and there's only 1.41 Million CRAVE in existence so the value of your collateral should go up over time.   
There's other ways of having a passive income with crypto rather than spending heaps of money on mining gear and power bills.
To the downvoters: I used to mine BTC starting in 2013 with GPUs, then with 28nm gear which is now gathering dust in the garage because it costs too much to run. 
Running masternodes is how I mine crypto now as an alternative to PoW mining.   I like Crave in particular because you only need 500 of them to set up a node.  Dash was too expensive for me when I first learned of this concept.
I'm using my old work PC and running XenServer on it, then split it up into small VPSs to run one node each.  The power costs are negligible and the returns are about 1.2 CRAVE per day per node. In a month that works out to 0.011772 BTC at current rates * number of nodes you've got. 
You also get to keep the underlying collateral, so it's a bit like a term deposit with a high rate of interest that you can close out of at any time. 
I've also found these coins to be more stable during an Alt slump because people with masternodes don't tend to dump their collateral at a whim, and you can reduce the risk of holding a coin because you can make more of them while holding, so even if they go down a bit you'll have more of them to sell.

Based on his writings and experience, I've come to think that the original idea and implementation came from Nobel prize winner John Nash and that Bitcoin is his vision of "Ideal Money" -  - Your thoughts?
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:57:57
There's no pre-mine at all with Crave, and it's been around since 2015.  
The original developer left ages ago and now it's a "community owned" coin with a new crew and lead developer.
@_date: 2015-04-26 08:59:30
I agree with you, and it seems good. I love the concept overall - debt free money, freedom from banks and middlemen and the underlying protocol is amazing.   I'd be happy if it was Nash that made it, he seems like a nice thoughtful guy in some of the interviews I've watched.  
There is a somewhat central authority though, the ability to merge code into the master branch on github, which is controlled by around 5 people.  Gavin Andresen, Cory Fields and Wladimir van der Laan  are now paid by MIT.  There was a plan for Bitcoin before it got created, and there will be a plan for it's future.  As someone who has invested large amounts of time and also money into Bitcoin, I'd rather know more than less about it.

After digging further I've come to believe that Nick Szabo is a pseudonym of Nobel prize winner John Nash and Bitcoin is his vision of "Ideal Money" - 
The Nick Szabo writings seem like possibly John Nash's  historic collection of all the research that was done to implement the idea properly.  I'm open to changing my mind if someone else has better insight.

Yes he can, I watched several interviews with him.  He stopped taking his meds for mental illness and focused on working with computers to keep himself sane. One interviewer made a point of commenting on his ability to keep up with technology even for his old age.
@_date: 2015-04-28 23:25:28
If you look down the bottom of the Wikipedia article, it's mentioned as a contender as well as the Euro..  I think Bitcoin has a better chance :)
@_date: 2015-04-26 12:02:03
He still writes very well today. Maybe he quit being the Satoshi persona because he was getting older?  
I was asked earlier about if he knew about encryption, and the wikipedia article for the movie goes into details about how he was invited to the Pentagon to crack codes.  That's why I mentioned it.  
Also he was interested in programming:
In an interview I saw it was mentioned that he was able to stop taking the schizophrenia meds by working with computers to keep himself sane. His wife worked as a programmer and is active at MIT alumnae programmes:

If you like Dash technology, check out [PIVX]( - A coin with a fair cash flow mechanism that needs no mining gear or energy waste. An amazing concept in my view. 
It too has lots of new tech coming like always-on zero coin TXs + mobile wallets etc.

Sorry I misread the thread. Still, it's faster than fiat or bitcoin so I guess the comment is valid either way :)  
@_date: 2017-06-25 01:57:41
I don't know if Bitcoin is up to changing that much to be honest, the miners probably like their chips-&gt;money route and wouldn't have a bar of it.  
But wanted to start a discussion about PoS tradeoffs - I was looking into Dash about two months ago and really wanted to set up a masternode but wasn't that flush at the time. 
So I starting looking around for similar coins and found PIVX as the next cheapest PoS coin with masternodes. 
It seems quite good, very fast confirmations and a well thought out economic system that rewards all the network participants fairly.  
I'd be keen to know your views for and against this coin as an example of PoS done right.
@_date: 2017-06-28 08:47:57

Yes surprisingly factual and with some real depth.  It is a bit weird the core dev team are getting paid by MIT in my opinion.

Hi - I've done some googling of your comments in the past about Proof of Stake and found this:  - now I've already been accused of shilling but I'm genuinely a fan of PIVX at the moment.  
I was wondering if you'd possibly looked at the PIVX Proof of Stake implementation, and if there was any way of judging a coin's security, as some people have said it would be vulnerable to "Nothing at Stake" issues, but the PIVX dev has published a post on it:  which seems to refute the claim.  
It's often compared to Dash, however it would be interesting to hear how it compares to Bitcoin, and if it could or could not compete equally in terms of blockchain security with Bitcoin? 
I've been mining BTC since 2013 and have accumulated a fair share of them, but now I've got a garage full of old 28nm miners that cost too much to run.  So PoS is attractive as a way of getting more crypto currency without having to buy it. It'd be good to know if it was less secure than Bitcoin before committing too much of it and then having the currency blow up.
@_date: 2017-06-28 13:48:34
I don't know, it seems commonly done by financial institutions.  I'm sure they understand it completely.  It could be a public relations ploy to diffuse the message and avoid talking about Bitcoin in the news but making it sound like it is THE something that everyone knows they're talking about.
