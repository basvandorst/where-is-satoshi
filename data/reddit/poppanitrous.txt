Bitcoin halves in 2020 and miners like myself wont mine if not economically feasible. So $25000-$50000 for 2020 is more than reasonable considering electricity costs and R.O.I. for miners..my s9 antminers plus fans to evacuate heat, psu's and 220v power supplies let alone thousands in electric bill at .09 kwH i dont see under 10k in 2019 and more than 25k in 2020..either that or miners will jump ship.

I am a miner here in USA..hashrate is up from 4.3 to 6.1 exahash in slushpool.
It is not profitable at .09 per kilowatt which I pay but im still mining before the halving in 2020..when miners leave pool,difficulty goes down and those who stay benefit.
Not an issue we are concerned with.

IRS I THOUGHT considered crypto property..maybe we should all get real estate licenses..lol
In the event a taxpayer has createdbitcoins or other cryptocurrencies through the "mining" process, theIRS generally considers the profits taxable as self-employment income. Since the IRS treatsbitcoin as property, online transactions using the cryptocurrency are subject to capital gains tax

Your inept view is laughable at best.
If someone waa running all s7 miners vs s15 miners now, how much you hash per kilowatt hour determines whether its economically feasible and absolutely dictates whether people can survive mining. If it.didnt.people would be mining.with cpu/gpu's still.
Smh..the greater your hashing power the greater your payout in your pool.

Everyone cannot afford to mine.
Electricity is 1 component..you need PDU. psu's, fans to evacuate heat, space to have the loud miners and money to replace bad hashing boards and fans that go out constantly..if you dont mine you have no idea how labor intensive it is to keep your operation up and running over a year.

Right now running s9s at .09kwh is not profitable but miners are still using them.
I will be switching to s15s by years end.
S9antminer =14terahash vs s15 antminer= 35terahash for 1600watts
