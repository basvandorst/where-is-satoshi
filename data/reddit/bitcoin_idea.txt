**Proposed Solution**: create an arduino bitcoin wallet to serve as a **hardware wallet** for a savings account.  The arduino will:
* display public and private keys
* generate a new public/private keypair so that the private key is **never** seen by a computer
* perform an encryption/transaction:
* generate the transaction (use the public/private keypair along with an (user-inputted) destination public key address)
* publish this transaction to an external device (I.E. usb key, wifi network, ethernet connection)
To use:
* When your bitcoin wallet becomes too fat: make a transfer to the arduino public key.  The arduino doesn't even need to know how much is in the account, the transactions just need to be published to the bitcoin network
* The arduino can generate transaction hashes when you want to transfer money **out** of the arduino savings account.  The user would then have to publish this transaction hash to the bitcoin network.  Overspending will simply be rejected by the bitcoin network
While this is terrible for the account owner, it was bound to happen eventually to someone.  This is both a business problem and a bitcoin problem.  I see two directions for this idea:
**closed source**: write the arduino code and offer the finished arduino project as a product
* benefits: more profit, higher entry-cost for would-be competitors
**open source**: arduino code is published online and peer-reviewed
* benefits: more collaboration will generally offer better security, will help the bitcoin community grow more by offering a low-cost method for easy security (which also generates more trust for the bitcoin currency)
For anyone that wants to take this idea and run with it, it's yours.  I'd personally like to see an open source solution developed, so users can just buy an arduino, review the code if so desired, then transfer the code to an arduino to have a secure, physical wallet.  However, even a blackbox-type product would still benefit the community, as it will make people more confident in the currency

Hmm, I'll consider it =P  In the mean time, I'll post it on the forum so someone with the time could deliver it faster
