I am currently attempting to get my BTC out of my Coinbase account and onto my Trezor. I started with a small test transaction, to which Coinbase says it's pending and has 0 confirmations. I decided to make another small transaction to a new address on the same Trezor account, again with the same result.
Neither transaction seems to be visible on the Trezor end. Does it have to get past the "pending" status on Coinbase before I'm able to see the transaction occur on Trezor? I just want to make sure I'm not losing these coins.
Finally, if the secondary address I created with the Trezor is no longer showing in the "receive payment" tab, is the second transaction I made still going to go through? Clicking "+more addresses" seems to bring up the same alphanumeric sequence that was generated before, but when I click off the tab, it disappears and I'm just left with the initial address.
Thanks for the help.

*An update* After ~15 hours, both transactions, and indeed a 3rd, have successfully transferred to my Trezor. A bit scary but glad it's worked out.

Thanks for the reply. After about 1.5 hours, transaction  is still pending and still has 0 confirmations. It is still unseen on the Trezor end. Transaction  is pending as well, but has 1 confirmation, and is showing on my Trezor wallet finally.
Not sure why Transaction  which was sent later in time, appeared first. The number of BTC sent was ~10x bigger than Transaction  Does the magnitude of the transaction have anything to do with confirmation time?
