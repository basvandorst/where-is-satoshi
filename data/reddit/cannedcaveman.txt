That doesn't really matter for this discussion because sooner or later it will happen. Or is it really a requirement for a 5 year old to be able to spend money unattended?
My point is that you see Bitcoin fail because of that silly requirement. Anyhow, in the future even a 5 yr old kid will probably be abl;e to purchase something with a purely digital form of money. But I sure hope kids will learn proficient math first.  
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:33:52
QR codes are a thing right now as a way to make the wallet addresses easy to use with current technology. In the future you will pay via apps, NFC or whatever. 
If you are interested in crypto you have to look a bit further than today, because it has only just started and technology is being developed right now. It's the birth and maturing of a programmable currency system we are talking about here. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:02:13
Then I really don't understand what you are doing in this subreddit ;)
There is a lot to read about the problems crypto's can solve. 
Maybe you don't realise what problems lay ahead with all the money that has been printed after 2008. I don't know if you know what caused the financial crisis and how that problem has been solved (because it hasn't been) but crypto's could also fix that, by not needing a not so trustworthy middleman. It solves that problem, you don't need a central organisation anymore for person-to-person (or rather peer-to-peer) transactions. That is the crypto-solution. 
But don't worry, you don't have to read anything and forget about Bitcoin until you will get interested by circumstances. And it's still early stages :)

You mean now we still have cash? Because in the near future we will all pay in digital money, be it current fiat or crypto. Does a 5 year old understand credit or debit card payments?
But besides that I agree Bitcoin right now is rather hard to understand and use and will have some evolutions to go through for main adoptance. But I doubt even 10% of the people really understand money in the broader sense, in what ever form or shape.

I like your analogy, but I don't agree that Bitcoin is just the product. It's build on top of a new technology. Your dollar won't work on the decentralized blockchain, it goes through the banking network. I do agree though that that goes for every blockchain/crypto-currency, so then the question is which crypto will 'win' in the end. And that's a question no one can answer, but for now Bitcoin still  by far is the biggest contender. 
And as unlikely it is that everybody will sell their Dollars or Euro's at once making those valueless, that would also go for Bitcoin if we are indeed heading towards a crypto-economy.

Why a gamble? You can always just hold. Right now all coins are almost pure speculation. There is almost nowhere to buy something with crypto’s.

Why doesn't it work? It's been proven for 8 years now that it works. 
And yes, there are some things that will need to change, probably the blocksize increase as well. But why does it all of a sudden have to work perfectly now? It is still new technology and Bitcoin most important feature is that it works and is SAFE. Why rush now because a lot of people want to get rich quick and want a perfect Bitcoin NOW so that it becomes mainstream and to a value of $1M.
But a small mistake might be devestating, a bug which will scare everyone away. Trust is easy to loose and almost impossible to get back.
Why don't we all stay patient and let the people who really KNOW what they are doing figure it out. It's a fascinating realm where so much is happening. Let's not fuck it up because of greed and lack of patience.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:27:45

@_date: 2017-12-22 08:40:39
Because larrger blocks isn't a real solution and adds risk. So right now it seems better, but at the expense of future risk of centraliziation. That is much worse than a true solution to the scaling problems. This is a long term thing that people are working on. So you need to be patient, don't expect any crypto to be able to replace fiat now. Give it some more months/years. If you don't see it happening ever, you might as well just stop with all crypto's or wait for a new altcoin solving it differently.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:19:33
I don't get any of it. Can you explain in laymen terms what this is about?
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:54:45
It can in the future. Right now it functions more as internet gold. Steadily growing in value (although big dips can happen), decentralized, en trustless. It's still in development and maybe it will function like a currency in the future and make some functions of traditional banks obsolete. Long way to go, but anything is possible.

How does all this make Trump a good president? He is totally not suited for the job. He’s ignorant, narcissistic and just plain stupid. I’m not saying Hillary would be any better, although for different reasons. But Trump is still an idiot. But this is all offtopic, so lets move on.

Yeah good point. I don’t know what he or they was/were thinking. 
But it’s still only 5% that he owns, and I read or heard somewhere it was 500k bitcoins and not 1 million. Would that be enough to crash it to death? Because if we all knew the big dump was his, then the problem is resolved and you can buy cheap bitcoins for a while ��

Well, it could function as a internet protocol instead of using API’s to servers of banks and authentication tools. This would work much smoother. Not advocating for this FB coin at all, but it has potential to be much easier to use and offers more functionality than the traditional currencies. 
Just like Bitcoin does by the way. And Bitcoin is a million times better than FB coin because it is more secure, trustless and permissionless.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:41:43

@_date: 2017-12-23 11:49:41
Not really, because in the end the result is the same. 8 times faster doesn't mean anything in the long run. And most of us rather have a safe decentralized coin than an unsafe decentralized one. Don't panic, have faith and patience and BTC will be on top.

Dude, I seriously suggest you start reading the facts and educate yourself (you don’t have to trust us) and figure out what the actual situation is. I would be very surprised if you still support bcash after that. It might be hard if you are invested in it, but you will benefit in the long run.

Thanks, cool story ;)
@_date: 2018-09-19 11:24:09
I think it will go down like all assets, because normally cash is king in these situations. I do think that when we recover, Bitcoins price will surge, even higher than that of gold. 
But gold is still regarded as the most safe asset right now I think. Older people have the most capital. But it’ll change.
@_date: 2018-09-12 06:45:25
Normal discussion aren’t moderated no. This is what I wrote in another thread about LN and if bigger blocks are needed:
Yes, that is right. That’s why Bitcoin will also get bigger blocks in the future when really needed. This has always been the plan, but you have to:
•	⁠be careful with it, prepare it well. Bitcoin Cash has shown big blocks can work. So that will be fine I think.
•	⁠be aware that bigger blocks and thus a bigger blockchain will harm decentralization because full nodes will be more expensive to run (higher requirements) That’s why the dev teams behind Bitcoin take it slow and choose to optimize on chain transactions and research 2nd layer like LN first.
•	⁠make sure that the security of Bitcoin is always the highest priority. Don’t rush anything that could harm the trust in the protocol. It’s understandable that people want everything now, but as we all experience when talking to friends, colleagues and family, adoption isn’t around the corner. And Bitcoin Cash shows, big blocks don’t mean high usage.
Just be patient and keep learning. It’s all very interesting. Now SegWit and batching of transactions are much more common, especially at exchanges, probably did a lot already. Adoption comes only with time, you can’t force such a new and complicated technology on the masses by rushing stuff. The need has to be created simultaniously with the technology.

I was only curious about your thoughts about scaling.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:54:49
So you are 100% sure that future developments will never help the problems with fees and transaction time? We are only at the beginning and there is a army of nerds trying to figure out what the best solutions are. If you trust the nerds that made the internet a succes (remember dial up cost, huge latency and tiny bandwith?) than a successful crypto will be possible.

Can I ask what you propose then? Just focus on LN and until then no increase in block size? Don't you see any risk in higher fees scaring of new potential users?
@_date: 2018-09-12 19:44:52
Possibly. Why? Did we need low fees during a sudden bubble because specuilators (that didn't understand one bit about Bitcoin) that wanted to get rich quick could speculate with paying low fees? Or did you really think the spike in december was caused by real adoption and everybody and their mothers were buying stuff with Bitcoin? 
Because that is what it was, a big bubble. And it helped BCH stay alive as you can see now in this bear market.
It's obvious you like the route of big blocks now more, so why don't you start with your arguments if you really want a discussion?

@_date: 2018-09-12 07:53:05
Not really no. Bitcoin has never failed to work. You could always make a transaction, even though the fees would be high. It was a temporary speculative bubble that has now popped. I get why some people mistaken it for 'adoption', but it's quite clear it wasn't that. Just talk to some of the people you know and ask them what they know about Bitcoin. The road to adoption is paved with bull and bear cycles. We don't need to give up security just to keep fees low so that speculators can try to get rich with a little less fee.
Bitcoin will get bigger blocks, that's not the debate. It's about the timing WHEN you want to increase the blocksize, because like it or not, bigger blocks have downsides that affect the security of the network. you simply cannot mess that up, you should never want that. And since december SegWit and the batching of transactions have really taken off, that should alleviate the stress one the network quite a bit. 
Look at Bitcoin Cash, they have bigger blocks for over a year, and no one is using it. And even worse, it's dropping down in value and hashrate compared to Bitcoin every day.
@_date: 2018-09-11 06:29:20

LN isn’t to replace on chain dude, its for small amounts like coffee and groceries.

No, you are just retarded.

@_date: 2017-12-27 13:17:29
You seem to be spot on for what I can see and understand myself. I own 2 of these and restored my wallet on the 2nd one I bought, and it worked. I also have a passphrase as my 25th word, which creates a hidden wallet. But yes, you could also use another wallet device or app to restore on which supports the seed. I feel pretty secure now.
As of risk, not much, just keep your seed words safe on multiple locations and create an extra hidden wallet using a passphrase connected to another PIN. That way if you get robbed you give the PIN to your wallet with the least amount, so the main one not protected by a passphrase (which is the only word you need to remember). Then even if someone steals your seed, they still cannot reach your new hidden wallet containing the biggest amount of coins.

But ok, keep yawning and keep telling people they are dumb and keep telling yourself you already know enough of everything. Keep looking at the charts and telling yourself it's the evidence for your wisdom. We need more people like that, you are a unique Redditor.

First of all you misunderstand the concept of LN and its use cases. If you want a 100% secure transaction on the blockchain, you make a Bitcoin transaction. Treat it like your savings account. 
Now think of LN as you wallet in your pocket, where your cash is. For everyday spending/shopping/gas station/lunch etc.
You transfer the money you want to transact with to you LN-wallet. The money you want to keep in safe storage stay in your Bitcoin wallet. 
If you want to do a large payment like for a new car, you might still want to use a Bitcoin transaction with multiple confirmations. LN doesn't replace Bitcoin, like Youtube didn't replace the internetprotocol.

English is not my native language, so I might make a few mistakes here and there, sorry for that.
And I don't mean copied as in forking (and not folking - haha I guess?) but as is double spending. You can fork a chain yes, but you can't fork the hash rate.
And paying with a debit card isn't instant, although to you it seems that way. The shop you pay to receives the money way later and sometimes doesn't get payed at all. And next to that, they have to pay their payment processors a lot, something else you don't see as a customer.
And like I also said, there is a lot of progress in the transaction time area, with LN (transactions in mere seconds like with a debit card) of 0-conf maybe like BCH are trying to do. Not a fan of that though, since it's not very secure.
Current money is centuries old, so a new technology has some catching up to do.
But the tone of your messages tell me a lot, that's why I presume you are in your early twenties, late teens. Almost every guy, me included, was once this arrogant and cocky over the internet. You'll grow over it I hope. 
Trust me, these are very interesting times and it's a very interesting technology. You can either learn about it if you enjoy it, or leave it alone. Right now you are just calling people stupid on Reddit, I doubt that is a fine investment in your future.
Good luck with that. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 11:24:38
Why would you spend your vacation sitting behind the computer posting nonsense? do you seriously have nothing fun in your life, that you resort to trolling for some attention?
you might as well read up on the technology and actually learn something. Attention from strangers on a anonymous forum isn't making you happy in the long term. You should invest, maybe not in Bitcoin, but in yourself.
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:14:09

Dude.... Do you remember anything from when your were an embryo? And do you know how many children grow up in horrible conditions (like in catholic institutions where they get raped, tortured with fear etc.) or in war zones or poor countries?
 
Why don't you learn to prioritize what you fight, instead of these backwards, religion fed, non issues. Abortion occur in the natural form as well. It all sucks, but shit happens. You could actually try to change the world to make it worth living in instead of fearmongering children about what is right or wrong according to a book and what you have been told your whole life.
 
I know you've been spoon fed nonsense all your life if you have religious parents and have been forced to go to church, but please don't keep spreading it any further.
You guys let fear rule the world. 
Edit: Do what you want with your life, but you should grant others the same. I know abortion falls in this perfect spot where you can call Murder! and pretend to be fighting a good fight. But if you delve deeper in to the situations these women (and often girls) are in, you'd know better. It sickens me, the people wanting to dictate what is wrong and what is right. In every religion and sect/cult there is so much unhappiness and sick behaviour because of it. Look at the Jehova's, Scientology, Catholic church. It makes people mad and I wish people would learn to trust themselves more, and not some organized bunch that claim to know everything.
Maybe I shouldn't try to change your world view or anything, but it really makes me sick to read people still believe a lot of crap, and not only that, but they try to limit other peoples lives and hurt them so they feel a little better, because they convinced them selves they are doing a good thing.

@_date: 2018-08-13 10:55:36
dude, don't start proving to me you know how everything works. You are uninformed and rude to others, so not a very interesting character. Yes there was a huge bubble, yes right now Bitcoin is far from being a usable currency and yes, there are a lot of people wanting to get rich quick. You are not a genius for seeing that.
It's the underlying technology that makes people enthousiastic. For the first time ever there is this global ledger where you can send money/tokens/coins or whatever you want to call it, over the internet, and it can not be copied and thus double spended. 
Down sides are the scaling, transaction times and usability. On all these areas there is a lot of progress going on. But you have to read about it to know about.
You are just looking at the price and shout 'it's a failure, you are all stupid and dumb. with terms you picked up like 'ponzi scheme'. You are very late to do that. These same 'arguments' have been given years ago already. And here we are again. All I'm saying is that this is a very interesting technology with a lot of potential. That's why some of the smartest coding nerds in this era are working hard in this area. They recognize the potential and they are not bothered by young guys on Reddit that think they know everything, even without reading.  
@_date: 2018-08-09 11:16:51

Ehm ok, maybe this is an age thing and you are a young guy who thinks he got it all figured out. In that fase they tend to call others stupid and dumb.

@_date: 2018-08-13 10:05:19


I seriously doubt that. Let's see what the next couple of years bring. It might never replace fiat money and may never become a currency, time will tell. But the technology in itself has great potential (you should know that since you studied it to great lengths) and it might as well become a form of internet money. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 12:34:12
Ok dude, you're the expert I guess.
@_date: 2018-08-07 11:50:25
Yes, but that doesn't make bitcoin cash -&gt; 'Bitcoin'
And Bitcoin is different from the software implementation Bitcoin Core. The coin is called Bitcoin.
They are deliberately trying to confuse people, and they use Bitcoin.com to do it, and r/BTC.
I don't like the childish war either, but the website is legit trying to mislead people for monetary benefit, that is not right.
This is litteraly on their frontpage right now:




They are saying BCash is an upgrade... It is not, it is a completely different coin.
They are saying there are high fees, there aren't right now.
They are saying there are slow transaction times, they are exactly the same as BCH.
So they are lying and scamming to new people so they can trick them into believing the scam.
@_date: 2018-08-13 11:38:41
I didn't say they need to be instant, you are the one who brought it up in a comparison with Bitcoin.
LN transactions are secure, so your knowledge lacks somewhat. Next to that it doesn't have to be (nearing) 100% secure like Bitcoin is, because it's for smaller amounts. It's like your wallet you carry with you for shopping. For bigger amounts that have to be very secure you can always use a normal Bitcoin transaction. 
Why are you so unpleasant to have a discussion with? With every line you type you want to make the other person feel dumb. That's says more about yourself than about the person you are talking to.
@_date: 2018-05-01 13:46:29
It's not a bad word, but when talking about Bitcoin in general as the currency or coin and not about the software development or implementation, 'core' is an unnecessary addition. Ver just uses it to create the illusion that 'Bitcoin  Core' isn't Bitcoin, but a one of many implementation of.. And it is not, it's Bitcoin, whether you like it or not.

But earlier you wrote you knew everything about Bitcoin except for the very technical aspects. How do you know everything there is to know, if you put aside great sources of information because, without even reading it, dismissing it as 'brain washing twoddle'. Maybe you are the 'idiot' you are calling others all the time.... No, you must be a genius know it all who doesn't have to learn and read.

I doubt that that is true, because it wont hit $200.000 all of a sudden, it will keep rising up until that point. That will make the market believe the potential is even higher. 
That is the way the market works. So I agree the marketcap is still relatively small, but the potential marketcap is almost infinite. 
Blackrock could also buy Apple or Amazon, so why do we still value their stocks? Because if someone were to buy all their stocks, the price would rise immensely. 
That's why I don't get what you are trying to say in your first paragraph.

Bitcoin dominance always goes up when the prices of crypto drop. If we get another bull run then the dominance will fall back to &lt; 30 again I think. 
Either way, it's not a real interesting stat in the short term, because it's also influenced by the amount of alt's, and because Bitcoin is still a huge gateway coin. Although I agree Bitcoin is by far the most healthy coin to own.

This is nonsense of course. Why would Bitcoin only be built right if it would scale on chain? On the internet we have had a lot of optimizations/scaling on several layers done, but no one would say the internet was designed wrong. We could have done a better job in hindsight, but we've found a way to scale it anyhow.
And please don't think BCH is perfect in that sense. Even if you use 10GB blocks, you still have a 10 minute confirmation time, way longer than random coin X.

I agree. I can definitely see a future with multiple coins coexisting. There was an YT a couple of days ago by Andreas where he was painting a picture that you can choose whatever economy you like to live in, and then simply use that coin.

Well, no one knows of course how that would go with bitcoin, but I trust more in maths than in people. What if in a crypto-economy we can learn how to deal with the economy because its plain mathematics and not politicians and central banks who configure it constantly. You seem to think that thje central banks and politicians are very good in what they do with the economy.

@_date: 2019-11-28 05:40:57
I’m not a maximalist per se, I can see another coin specifically used for a certain usecase that is better suited for that then Bitcoin. If LN turns out to not be a total solution to make BTC suitable as a medium of exchange, maybe an alfcoin pegged to Bitcoin might offer that.
But I do get annoyed by altcoiners most of the time. It mostly because most of them entered the space in 2017 when all alts were booming and these new ‘investors’ sucked up all the promises and lies. Every altcoin starts bashing Bitcoin like it is old tech and their altcoin is better. But they always only look at one or two aspects, mostly TPS and fees, and forget about the most important ones. Which in my view are: no leadership in BTC, most secure with PoW, most decentralized with either development as in distributed full nodes, the best network effects and the fact it’s by far the most liquid (easily sellable for fiat) and acts as the reserve currency with all the trading pairs.
But they just act like they know it all and still their coin in their heavy bags is much better than Bitcoin. They just skipped the learning phase where you first need to understand what money is, how the financial system works, why Bitcoin is the genius invention that it is etc. It’s tiring to read, especially since so many other new people get lured in to talk the same shit.
@_date: 2019-11-20 08:18:34
I don’t think this is in the spirit of Bitcoin. We are supposed to download and verify the blockchain ourselves. I’m not too technically versed to know if you could do harm by providing an altered blockchain, but if people are willing to run their own node, they are probably wary to buy it.
And 250 GB SD cards? Maybe $30 is a good deal then. Just erase it and use it for other stuff ;)

Premine means it was privately mined before release. Until 2140 everyone can mine Bitcoin.
Premined coins are dodgy because the makers could mine without competition and without the rules that are within the protocol. 
So basically they have a blockchain with rules for consensus, but they privately abused it for their own gain.

I had the same problem with MynodeBTC, the script kept throwing errors about the Bitcoin daemon. So I followed fhe Raspibolt guide by Stadicus and that worked. Just follow the guide to the letter.

Dude it’s in context of the financial system. By your definition no system can be decentralized. You act like you figured it all out because of your definition, but Bitcoin is decentralized. 
There is no central database and anyone can participate.
@_date: 2019-11-19 08:52:08
I get that! Take your time :)
It took me about 2 days, because you also have to download the blockchain on your pc, then transfer it to you external HDD connected to your Pi4 and then let it validate it on there. Those things are time consuming, there is also some waiting involved. 
But again, once you have it running it will feel great.

Welcome on board!
A hardware wallet gives you the most safety and easy of use, since you are new. Purists will tell you you shouldn’t rely on anyone, but security is hard and when you are new it can be quite overwhelming. Don’t worry, now you have skin in the game, you will learn much faster.
If you have a considerable amount of Bitcoin (more than lets say 500 dollars worth) then I suggest you get 2 HW wallets (Trezor or Ledger for example) and first install one of them, then move your coins and then ‘restore’ your seed on the second one.
That way you have an identical backup if you happen to lose one AND most importantly you have simulated what you have to do when you do need to recover your wallet. It will give you peace of mind.

Of course no one can no for sure what will happen to the price. But if you look at the history of Bitcoin, albeit still very young, it can be expected to get into another bubble phase. Again, there is a real possibility that it won’t happen for various reasons, but if you consider the $1000 you have like a bonus you won’t need for the next 3-5 years and want to ‘invest’ it to grow it to a higher number, then you sure could buy some Bitcoin.
Next to the chance to gain money from it, you will most likely start to learn about this new technology, the economy, what money really is and about investing, patience, regret, joy and utter depression ;) So quite the experience I’d say.

I just listened to the Stephan Livera podcast with Thomas Voegtlin of Electrum wallet and they’ll add LN real soon. Great podcast btw, that Thomas is a real Bitcoiner.
I only started using Electrum recently when running my first full node with Electrum Personal Server on it and the Electrum wallet on my main pc, so I am really excited by that news. It seems like the best option if you use hardware wallets like me, and you want the Ledger, Trezor etc to use your own node to validate.
So this will have me started with LN as well.

He never got to test with &gt;32 MB blocks  with as many users world wide as there are today to see what obstacles lay ahead. You can only scale so much on the base layer, and that is not enough for it to be used as cash all over the world. 
His ultimate goal was to replace central banks/banks. And that can still be done.
@_date: 2019-11-19 07:54:33
I just set up my first full node on the PI4. I recommend following the Raspibolt guide from Stadicus. Just follow it to the letter and you will learn so much. And it will actually work! With other guides/sites I ran into trouble, but maybe I made a mistake.
Don’t give up, it feels great when you have it running. I actually have my own HW wallet connecting to my own full node now. So I bought some more Bitcoin, and I saw the transaction getting validated by my own node. 
If you have questions, maybe I can help.
@_date: 2019-11-02 11:31:39

Miners and wallet producers aren’t the same as internediairies. They can’t forbid or withold you to do anything because they don’t know it’s you they are dealing with. And even if they did, you can always switch. I hope you can see the difference with a centralized system that you need an account for from a third party. And no, a wallet is not the same.
As to pyramid and Ponzi schemes, there are a few key differences actually. You can read about it here:  but just Google it yourself. The comparison has been made a lot in december last year.

I have never seen this, thanks for sharing. Dalio is a very knowledgeable man, so always interesting to hear what he has to say. 
And his points are valid, right now Bitcoin effectively is little more than a speculative asset and developers are busy improving it. 
LN is being build to allow it to be used as a medium of exchange and the volatility is an ongoing concern that should be mitigated with more adoption. Now that products for financial investors are being launched, with BAKKT being the most recent, that too should become less. But I doubt we’ve seen the last bubble and I dont think that is a bad thing. After a couple of more halvings the volatility might come down as well.
@_date: 2019-11-18 09:32:27
Yes, I used the stadicus guide as well!
I don’t know what happened, I followed the guide step by step I think, but I got different errors when I had the external HDD plugged in or not. I reached out on Twitter for help but didn’t get a response, so I decided to go with Raspibolt. 
I’m just glad I got it all to work now.

But they do address the issues, but it’s not priority number 1 ( that is always security in Bifcoin) and it is not by simply hardforking to a bigger block size. There are good reasons for that, but it’s not because there is a goal to frustrate users, but a goal to maintain security while developing other means of scaling. Be it through SegWit, other optimizations on chain, through side chains or second layers. And that is not what you say.

I was never a guy that listened to podcasts, but now I do everyday. To Bitcoin podcasts. And not just new ones, the most interesting ones are the ones from a few years ago. It gives so much insight in who actually is interesting to listen to in how they talked in the past and what reasoning they used for ‘predicting’ the future. 
It further strengthened my opinion on why Bitcoin is already great the way it is right now.

It’s not too bad, there are some good guides online. Search for the Stadicus guide for Raspibolt. I used it about 3 weeks ago and I was very pleased with the guide. 
I had a few other tries before with other guides and ran into errors. That was frustrating. But following the Stadicus guide immediately felt right. You will learn a lot, but you can just copy paste the commands given.
I now have my Bitcoin full node and an Electrum server on the PI4, and now I can use my hardware wallet through the Electrum wallet on my PC using the full node on the PI4!

If you call Bitcoin a centralized system then you are either deliberately wrong or you don’t understand what decentralized means. It is an open protocol, anyone can connect to the network and transact.
@_date: 2019-11-18 08:53:06
I tried MynodeBTC this weekend but I didn’t get it to work. I kept getting an error when the script tried to start the bitcoin daemon. 
I installed Raspibolt with an online guide instead. I have to say it was hard but a very good learning experience. I’m actually glad I had to do it the hard way. 
So while mynodebtc is a good idea for non tech savvy people, you only really start to understand it if you do it the hard way.
Now I have my own full node I can accees through SSH, installed Linux, mounted a HDD, installed Bitcoin Core, downloaded and validated the blockchain on my pc, moved it to the Pi4, installed Electrum personal server on the Pi4 and the Electrum wallet on my Windows PC and have my hardware wallet used with that. I actually bought some Bitcoin and saw it getting valdiated on my own node!
It was a great experience.
@_date: 2018-10-14 06:53:17
That’s not the definition of a pyramid scheme. 
Bitcoin is a system that works and is decentralized and uncensored, meaning that from this day on you can buy and sell it and no intermediaries are necessary. That doesn’t say anything about the value and price of it, but just merely being that, on top of being truly internet money (it’s a protocol and it can be sent like an e-mail) makes it at least worth &gt;  zero. You decide if you are interested or not, but it will keep going regardless and you don’t have to sell your Bitcoin to at least two others. The system keeps working and you can participate or not.
Just that and what is possible, and the potential of becoming something even more functional with micropayments etc makes it not a pyramid scheme. 
@_date: 2019-11-27 12:23:23
Yep. I use two hardware wallets. With 1 I created my wallet and seed phrase, on the other I ‘recovered’ that seed. So now they are identical and they both can be used to sign transactions.

You can’t cherry pick things and then come to the conclusion it’s the same.
I have had these discussions before and it’s always with people that don’t really want to learn about crypto and have made up their minds beforehand. 
You can of course believe what you want, but I can promise you that if you are really interested in the tech you will cone to the conclusion it is not a pyramid scheme. I’m not saying you will get rich quick, but in my opinion it certainly has the potential to become a lot bigger in a few years. Not as an instrument to become rich, but because it has a lot of upsides compated to traditional methods. It’s actually very interesting if you like technology :)

No, you are obviously biased (if you even identify yourself with your preference in fee hight...) and you probably don’t even want to know WHY Bitcoin works the way it works. You are just a consumer that thinks ‘I want no fees and that is why we need bigger blocks’. 
You are no blockchain dev, yet you just argue it is a good thing to use bigger blocks so you have to pay no fees. You don’t care about other scaling solutions, you don’t care what scaling solutions are being developed and which ones already are being used on Bitcoin, you just want to get people to use the coin you like. Because you with all your wisdom think its best to pay no fee for an on chain transaction. 
If you would just TRY to understand the actual reasons for the current size and what the arguments really are instead of just posting lies about no intentions to scale. Like dude.. you can have your opinion, but you are not helping anyone by lying, not learning and using Reddit to mislead users.

So yes, it is a shame that all the miners burn so much electricity, but since it's the only way we know to really make the network secure it probably is worth it. We should move to clean energy anyways.

@_date: 2019-10-28 04:58:53
I’m pretty sure the development doesn’t stop here. As long as Bitcoin stays the most decentralized censorless borderless money as it is now, it will grow despite fees. The current characteristics are enough to replace gold for example. If we need to use it as a real money for day to day purchases (fiat still works fine for that right now) maybe LN will be ready for that, or another solution will have developed or another coin will be used for that.
But there is no real adoption for that, 99% of the people dont even know what Bitcoin really is and have never even heard of other coins besides maybe Ethereum. This is still so early days, no need to give up the strong points like security and an actually working system, to gain some throughput. Right now everyone in the foreseeable future can run a full node and actually be their own bank. No other coin has the mix that made Bitcoin king. You might not see the value and think tx throughput is the most important thing. For people with serious money security is probably most important.
@_date: 2018-06-21 09:19:10
'The boom'. That's what has been said at every ATH in the past.
Bitcoin is still very hard to learn, acquire and use for an average person. Institutions are slowly coming in as the Nasdaqs and the NYSE's of this world are entering the space.  The avarage person still doesn't really know what Bitcoin is. They don't even know what money they use really is, as most of the people still think we have some sort of gold-standard. 
I really think there will be new ATH's (and huge dips after) as long as the bitcoin-network stays healthy. Why would the price drop severly and never bounce back as the workings a proven and you have an asset-class that is uncorrelated with the other markets? By definition that makes it a good hedge against other markets failing/recessions I think.

@_date: 2018-06-09 10:39:04
Yes ofcourse, but on-chain transactions will never go away and that is what they are securing. 
If you see Bitcoin as gold, and you see 2nd layer transactions as paper money backed by gold, the owner of the second layer paper money has a bit less hard (and less secure) money and can always choose to convert it back to real Bitcoin or gold. I don't think people that own Bitcoin will only be using LN and never do on-chain transactions. LN is more of a wallet you carry around for you normal day to day purchases, and your real Bitcoin is your savings account that you transact every now and then with to keep you money secure. 
That service will always exist, and miners will always get paid for doing that. 
You seem to be suggesting that miners should get paid for services they arent even providing and should be involved in every action surrounding Bitcoin. I don't think that's reasonable and feasible. That is the same as banks charging you when you pay with paper money at a store, while they don't even service that particular transaction.
Higher layer solutions never obsolete the lower layer functionalities, they are build upon that and allow for scaling that is impossible to achieve on the lowest level. So even with 1 GB blocks you wont get to Visa standards, besides al the other negative consequences aof huge blocks.

But if Bitcoin is supposed to be permissionless, then why do we need people to label transactions as either spam or legitimate? The feemarket should take care of this.
I do understand what is meant by spam in this case, but I dont know what to think about subjective labeling. The system is supposed to be robust.
And aren’t you hindering honest users by reducing the blocksize as well? Fees will go up for everyone.
@_date: 2019-10-02 08:27:36
The drop to 3.5K and then the rise up to well above 10K again (almost 14K) should give you confidence it can and eventually will rise again. 
If Bitcoin was a dud, scam, Ponzi, it wouldn’t bounce up again after being busted. 
I’m a long time hodler and have only ever put money in I could lose, so for me it’s easy talking, but I am very confident we will experience new bubbles and new high’s. It is the road to a stable world wide used Bitcoin. It’s bumpy, but you can learn how to ride it and enjoy the experience. You just got on at a suboptimal time :)
@_date: 2018-06-21 11:19:07
What are you trying to say? Don't talk about how things really work, because the central banks and real wealthy don't care? Don't educate the people, because it is how it is and will always stay that way?

@_date: 2019-10-02 11:11:20
What do you mean exactly? You think it is failed already? Because I think it has been a quite successful launch. Maybe not as big from day 1, but wait till the next bull run (bubble) and I think a lot of institutional investors will come in.

@_date: 2019-10-23 10:04:47
The fee is independent from the amount you transfer. Right now fees are very low, but in a new bubble phase the fees will probably grow  higher than $1 again. For that reason 2nd layer solutions are being developed, like Lightning Network and sidechains.
@_date: 2019-10-02 11:09:21

How much transactions per second are possible with BCH blocks? VISA amounts? Because I think that was the culprit. I listened to old podcasts from around that time, one of which was a debate between Jeff Garzik and Eric Lambrozo if I remember correctly, and it seemed clear that there was no clear scaling solution long term. It was the commercial side who wanted big blocks to have low fees for now versus the developers who wanted a block size increase via SegWit and have a decent long term solution without giving up the ability for users to run there own node.
If you want people to be their own bank, they must be able to run their own node. For me it was clear that the only reason Bitcoin is still souvereign is because the commercial forces didn’t succeed into forcing Bitcoin to give up the ability to remain as decentralized as it is right now. 
Even LukeJr who said he would like 300KB blocks has admitted a block size increase on the future is more likely than a block size decrease. The problem right now is already the initial sync time and the propagation times for larger blocks. That’s why they are building on efficiency first.
@_date: 2019-12-13 08:08:54
Why would there be a demand for a stable coin pegged to an unstable currency? I get why stable coins are a success on exchanges, to get out of a crypto quick if you are a trader. But for the general public I think it’s only a stepping stone to Bitcoin eventually. Because with all fhe QE still gong on, people would want to store wealth outside of the fiat money sinkhole that is forming.

Ok, but how many MB’s do you need for Visa level TPS? If you go for a victory against FIAT by being a better medium of exchange, I don’t see how you would get there with just big blocks.
And furthermore, if you make it harder to run a full node and essentially only miners do, it just creates an attack vector for both the miners side and the various states that can more easily block nodes to disrupt the network.
@_date: 2019-12-03 19:46:49
What’s the TPS with a 32 MB block anyways? I just don’t understand their long term vision.

I think that if it this becomes a real possibility it will create consensus to hard fork to a bigger block size. The only time I think a hard fork will be done on Bitcoin is when everybody agrees there is no other choice.
@_date: 2019-04-16 07:45:13
Bitcoin cannot just do that, because it requirers a hardfork.

The cheapest way is probably setting up a laptop/pc you already have, but I bought a Raspberry PI4 myself (about $50) and an external HD (500 GB, also cheap) and followed the Stadicus guide. It is some work setting it up, but the guide is great and easy to follow and you learn so much. 
That guides also has a section to setup Electrum Personal Server on your PI4 and with that you can download the Electrum wallet on your pc. Then you are good to go to use that Electrum wallet on your PC to connect to your Ledger or Trezor of other HW wallet. You then no longer have to use the Ledger etc software, but you use your HW wallet connected to your OWN full node via Electrum wallet connected to Electrum PS on your PI4. 
It might sound complicated now, but you will get it if you follow the guide. 
It’s a great feeling after you’re done :)

Cobra is not a sock puppet.
The picture shows truth, but it doesn’t mean it could be any other way. Do we still think it’s actully possible to have all the transactions in the world broadcasted and all the blocks propagated without problems on a blockchain that is manageble in size?
I think the purpose of Bitcoin has indeed shifted and even though it is a shame that Bitcoin itself isn’t technically able to service everyone in a straight P2P direct payment system, that doesn’t mean it still can reach these goals through other means.

In theory yes. That last part of your sentence is the crux. I suspect there never will be a hard fork again, unless there is a critical error found that could mean severe losses for all parties.

It's not really Ver against CSW. Ver is just a weasely worm caught in the middle with no power. He has a big ego and wants to be seen like he has power, but he needs others for that. It used to be Jihan, then tried to worm next to CSW but got rejected hard. He only outed himself against Craig recently. 
Basically it's CSW (well, Ayre has the money) against the rest. He is a psycho by the way. Ver is just a narcissist.

But all the criminal activities and terrorism in history combined have been done with current money, so how are we having a solution now?
Criminals often will use new technology first if it works, like cellphones and the internet. That doesn't mean we should ban the tools. Do you think that would be a solution, stop all advancements because criminals might use it too? They also drive cars and eat bread you know.

It 'dropped' to 28% It's just variance in the amount of Segwit transactions at the time. And who knows the Coinbase size of the pie?

Dude, how is that 'the only' reason the price went up? Most of the normal ppl never even heard of Lighting network. And not only that, why would you open a thread just because you have a brainfart and present it as a fact. It's not what the article is about. 
Yes, Lighting is still in testing fase and yes there are certainly still bugs, but to go from there to saying all hope is lost for Bitcoin is... well, weird. You don't even present your thoughts or make argument, just a suggestive title linking to an article.

Could be. It's still too early to tell. Maybe it's somewhere in between, like an all in one. Maybe this is so different that we need to redefine money and how we use it.
With LN and all the other developments going on coming, who know's what will happen. Economics have never been a hard science, maybe it will be once we let mathematics and not politics and commercial institutions run the show.

Haha, yea that was a fun comment to read. This was only 2 years ago, and see how far Bitcoin has come. Not only in price, but in the way a lot of people (like me) really learned something about the economy and what money really is and isn't. And the amount of people that have heard of it and gotten either interested or afraid of it (new technology always divides at first).

I don't think he does anymore. I've heard him say it failed when there was a gold standard, but he might still think it's better than current fiat backed by nothing, but I also think he's opening up to the idea of Bitcoin or another crypto as a replacement.

I hate the prominent people in Bitcoin. What a toxic bunch of man childs fill this space. Adam Back, Bashco, Saffidean, Whalepanda, and there are a dozen others..
I hate when you go on Twitter and all the supposedly big characters are all jumping on tweets from Vitalik or anyone else for that matter and spew toxic shit without actual information that is useful for people who need to learn.
You would think there are more interesting information to convey if you know so much about Bitcoin. But no, lets call everything a shitcoin while being toxic in general, that will scare newcomers away. 
There is so much interesting stuff to talk about, but it’s just like r/btc, just hate on others. What a retarded community. It’s a good thing that math and science rule this space, because if it was social skills or being a decent human being we would all be fucked.
That’s why I like Andreas so much, he actually is trying to inform people about technical or the more abstract layers around crypto.

@_date: 2019-09-26 16:30:26
Yes, but when it steadily climbs (but that is an if) then they probably will. I think institutional money coming in, either through BAKKT, the CME or other means could also spark their interest.
I’m just confident that BTC will keep running and that eventually more and more people will come in. It’s already in the news so much more and I also know quite a few people who are curious but find it too difficult to understand still. As it slowely becomes more mainstream and the software gets easier, they’ll try it eventually. And we need better/easier on-ramps.
@_date: 2019-09-25 18:18:26

Nothing, because the last price of trade would be a penny. But this is all in theory of course. If BTC goes down to lets say a 1000 dollars, a lot of people would buy because they would believe it eventually go up again. People like you and me and all the other speculators out there. 
Even if Bitcoin isnt developed any further, what it does now is enough to never go to 0 and always be a speculative vehicle. Thats why Im never worried about my holdings. I just cant see a situation where it will go to 0, and I havent spend a fortune on BTC, so Im good.

I get what you mean, but I disagree slightly. In Bitcoin, even with custodial wallets, there are no central banks printing money. Yes, you can get fucked over by this ‘cryptobank’, but for a lot of people the danger of losing their keys/seed/BTC is much higher if they have to manage them themselves. Do you really see your parents/grandparents using crypto right now in day to day life? Hell, do you know how many stupid young people there are?
I think we need custodial wallets if you want adoption.

Sure, but that doesnt mean they dont come back. You dont need a lot of people to want BTC, you just need more demand than supply on the market. Eventually they will come back if the price is going up again and the FOMO is back. I still know a lot of people who never bought BTC yet. Way more than people that have. Some of them will buy in the future.

You convinced me with your arguments, thanks.

I'm not saying any of that, I just remembered that right now Bitcoin isn't deflationary. 
And regarding the horrors of a deflationary economy, I recently read some articles that don't follow the narrative that deflation is bad, period. 
Like: 
And besides that I'm also wondering how the future with AI and robotics, self driving cars etc will suit a new Bitcoin based economy better (or maybe worse) than our current one, because of higher unemployement. But that is another subject that just popped up in my mind.
@_date: 2019-09-17 20:43:19
That doesn’t make sense, like you dont understand your own reply.
Unless you know Satoshi is still alive and the BTC address he’s using, I’d say this is the perfect way of showing gratitude. 
Not that I would do it btw..
@_date: 2018-07-24 22:25:31
Also dont forget to tell your sweet old granny to spend all her savings on BTC now. She’ ll die very very rich
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:23:51
First of all Bitcoin will be inflationary till 2140 I believe, right? Since block rewards will create new Bitcoin until then.
And I still don't see how we somehow stop producing the things we need in any situation, and just die all together because we have a deflationary currency. 
@_date: 2019-09-14 14:04:17
You can’t say that with 100% certainty. What if there is an attack vector that we don’t know about yet? What if a bug slips in the code that does harm?
Bitcoin is only 10 years old. We shouldn’t pretend we’ve seen it all and predict the future with certainty.
@_date: 2019-09-15 14:37:58
Nope, but cool to know! Slow but steady rise.
@_date: 2018-07-04 17:40:37
Salty, bitter and zesty.
@_date: 2019-09-14 12:28:01
But it simply isn't. It's an asset in an open market. It has no structure, everybody can buy and sell and the value/price gets determent by that. It's not only profit until there are no more 'fools'. The price goes up and down.
Hell, we've seen multiple bubbles and crashes already. If a Ponzi scheme crashes, it's dead. It just implodes and won't recover. 
So I don't see how you can say those are 'kinda' the same.
@_date: 2019-09-06 08:10:36
That in itself doesn’t make scaling impossible. The block size is a method of scaling itself, but there are others. But most likely it will have to be adjusted even more than it did with SegWit at some point.
@_date: 2018-07-25 12:42:01


You don't have to, right? Even Bitcoin forks with extra features don't have the hashrate behind them, so even if they have additional features, you already know they are not as safe. Bitcoin is objectively the safest coin there is, so right now, as all crypto can only service as a speculative investment or store of value (it's not a currecny yet as there is no adoption), Bitcoin is by far the best coin out there.
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:17:30
Wtf... nevermind dude, go waste someone else's time.
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:33:53
Haha wtf, grow up dude :)
@_date: 2019-09-02 19:20:21
Yes it is, the whole world runs on FIAT dude. The way you reply in this thread is also extreme(ly rude).
It’s great to be enthousiastic, but you can’t force adoption. You are not helping anyone by acting like an ass. You don’t live in the future. If crypto is destined to replace FIAT, it will do so regardless of this guy using a debit card that he thinks serves him best right now.
@_date: 2019-09-06 08:03:44
I knew it was you!
@_date: 2019-09-10 14:09:19
Dude, you must be rich if you can predict with certainty why is going to happen! 
I wish I was a triangle whisperer like you.
@_date: 2019-09-18 07:19:20
Ah yes, I see this a lot in my environment (work/family)
Some people desperately want this to fail because they dont get it, dont want to get it, think they are ‘too late’ and dont want other people to get rich with gambling.
I get how this works so I cant blame some of those people. I do find it annoying if people that I consider to be smart don’t want to get it and explain to me how ‘real’ money is backed by gold... And after I convinced them to check how that is not true, they explain to me that the government will ban it.
We have all been through that cycle when learning about this, but it is annoying as fuck if they simply don’t want to learn and just keep throwing bogus in your face to prove it’s a dud.
@_date: 2018-04-18 09:48:09
Blockchain.info for example. You can create a wallet there and then login with username, password. You can use your bitcoin without knowing your private key.
@_date: 2018-04-19 15:16:38


That's really far fetched
@_date: 2018-07-26 06:35:49
Maybe he used meth instead of math ;)
@_date: 2018-07-26 07:23:44
It's just how we talk about things. In software testing you have logical and physical test cases, but either way it's still digital entries you are talking about.
@_date: 2018-12-03 18:56:46
Dude, just stop, you don’t even understand the very basics. Just because you can fork off doesn’t mean you can create more bitcoin. Bitcoin is by far the most secure crypto out there. Any shitfork is worth only a fraction because it doesn’t have the amount of PoW behind it to secure it. 
Please, safe us both some time and read and look up stuff. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 19:31:55
Again replying to you own spam account.. What happened to you in life to be this ehm... troubled.
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:45:29
They dont have to mine if they dont think its profitable. The difficulty adjustment will do its work.
@_date: 2018-12-16 00:37:39
So you just spend your saturday spamming in here? Like 50+ comments on a new account... Why? What kind of live do you have that you do this on your weekend? 
I’m bearish for your happiness.
@_date: 2018-12-09 09:25:16
Lol 4 days old account non stop spamming FUD. This is how you spend your weekend? Dude, your post history is crazy for a 4 days old account.
A great life you must have...
Jesus christ, go make some friends or a family dude, the money you are getting for this probably isn’t worth it.
You should ‘invest’ your time on more productive things ;)
@_date: 2018-12-06 11:08:29
I'm afraid it is pure meth
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:49:16
Wtf you post this reply in every thread? That is how you spend you saturday? 
Exiting life you must have....
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:01:24
That actually does make sense, thanks.
What do you personally think will break this downwards spiral, and what do you think will create the bottom? You describe miners turning off their rigs, but didn’t that happen already?
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:34:01
You sir are correct. Have an upvote.
@_date: 2018-12-09 19:29:33
You are replying to your old spam account with your new one. You are either paid to troll/FUD or you have a mental condition. Either way it’s not healthy and beneficial for you and other people.
Seek help or a normal job.
@_date: 2018-12-04 08:15:22
Well, if a Redditor for 6 days says so, I better believe it.
@_date: 2018-12-09 19:26:36
Wtf you already made a new account and started spamming again? 
You are that u/Whatsallthetodo2 or something like that..
Seriously, is this your job or do you have a mental condition? This is not healthy dude. Get a life.
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:13:07
Great comeback dude, you really got me there.
Just read everything back. You made a retarded statement, multiple people corrected you, but instead of acknowledging you made a mistake you type multiple walls of text to convince yourself and others you were right anyway. 
Wow. Good luck in life and with coming up with yet another great comeback of a thousand words or more.
@_date: 2018-12-16 00:50:20
Nice post sir :)
@_date: 2018-12-04 13:43:31
Yes, there are no developers working in this space anymore, everybody left the building. We now know for a fact Bitcoin could never work. 
Thank you for your observations good sir. Very accurate. We had 10 years, now we are too late. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 09:02:08
Crypto in total? Probably. But there are only 21 million Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-03 19:45:20
Omg, yes please stop.. So many words, such little understanding.
@_date: 2018-12-08 10:02:50
Looks way too centralized. 
If you keep zooming out until you only see one dot.
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:11:44
I know you are a BSV believer and maybe you can explain to us how new nodes and miners are going to do their initial syncs when the GB blocks will be used. And how do you propagate them fast enough?
And how would you go about microayments with BSV with on chain reactions with 10 minute blocks?
@_date: 2018-12-09 19:55:31
I think that would only pose a risk with a hard fork where there is no clear support. I’m pretty sure no one would want to risk that, and everyone wealth is at stake. So if there would be a 50/50 divide, it’s in all of their interest to not want a fork and first find consensus.
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:25:07
I think I was pretty clear. 
You replied twice to a spam account that is 4 days old and has a gazzillion comments (all negative) in here with lots of disinformation.
When I confront him, he stops posting and your account comes up (brand new) and your first reply is to him complimenting him and all your posts so far are like his’.
Maybe it’s all a great coincidence, I’ll leave that to the moderators, but I seriously doubt it.
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:31:13
Bitcoin is not a share in a company, it’s a high risk speculative asset. People arent investing in Bitcoin, it’s speculating. Thats why we had a huge bubble. There was no adoption, no investing, just (mostly) people wanting to get rich.
We are all only interested in the tech of course.
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:24:33
Lol, Im pretty sure everbody sees that dude. Its more about if you believe another bubble will come. So far that has always been the case and Im pretty sure it will, but first we ride the capitulation fase. I think we are not even there yet.
@_date: 2018-12-17 22:27:23
Ehm you can’t fool me buddy. 
I did the math, I checked, rechecked and then checked again, and it changes 0,01 %
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:47:16
What? Difficulty adjustments, look it up bro.
@_date: 2018-12-12 21:24:29
Lol, wanted to say the same thing :)
@_date: 2018-12-03 15:16:49
Cool story bro.
Not ICO’s, Bitcoin. You said it is possible to create more of them than the 21 million by forking, which of course isn’t true. So save yourself some time by not coming up with excuses but acknowledging you are wrong.
@_date: 2018-12-17 16:03:43
So spam account like I noticed right away? Get a life dude, you are a pathetic piece of shit with too much time and too few sanity pills.
@_date: 2018-12-04 10:08:35
Yes, if someone with a 6 days old account is willing to risk his hard earned credibility with daring calls, it really says something. I think it adds to the usefulness of this sub and I always go all-in on these calls. Really informative, I wish we had more people with throw away accounts willing to put the effort in of posting their expectations.
@_date: 2019-05-07 09:37:35
$6000 could be next. 
OH RLY?
@_date: 2018-12-12 12:11:12
You forgot to put arguments with your statements.
@_date: 2018-12-02 22:13:00
Right, so you must be rich right now because you keep on selling your own created Bitcoins for $4000?
@_date: 2018-12-01 08:37:35
Are you feeling blue right now?
