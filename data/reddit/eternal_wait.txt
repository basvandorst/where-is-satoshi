Come bitcoin! Come down again. Some of us are double dippers...

Some speculators lose like in any market. Hodlers haven’t lost anything. If you believe in the tech you will hodl.

Well last 30 hours it’s been around 13,000 €. I feel things are kind off settling down after last thursday. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:28:18
This looks like a “volatilic rise” and the recent 3 all time highs look like micro bubbles. Prepare for the [bull run] (&lt;

Hey! It’s me! Your charitable cause!

God am stupid in this subject! My background is biology and Playstation 4. If you care to keep answering questions it would be great. 
Like, how do i get said keys for the now mine 0,127 BTC that appears in my Kraken login? I tried reading the wiki and the info at kraken but don’t understand crap, its all key this, wallet that and something something blockchain. I tought some kind of code would be given to me by kraken but that didn’t happen.
Kraken allows me to “withdraw” my coins. Withdraw it to where? And what is the address it asks for? It can’t be my home address, or is it?
From what i understood the wallet has the keys that locate the bitcoin, but where are the coins? Where does it exist? The cloud, someone’s computer? 
Remember, if you think you dumb it down, dumb it down some more.
I need to get this right, i don’t need the money i used and plan to hodl it. But have no idea how to prove years from now that those satoshies are mine! HALP!

And here i am still waiting for my funds to get to kraken. ��

Forks! How do they work?!
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:49:23
Thanks for that.
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:19:21
Trezor is free if you wait till february. It comes in at 89€. The other one is a little bit more with the shipping.

So did a major news outlet in spain. They called it a bubble and that it is dumb to invest in it right now.

Look! [this] (&lt; story posted today can add to our conversation yesterday. Rootstock is one solution to bitcoin’s scalability. It propouses a second blockchain paralel to bitcoins to store information without making bigger blocks. One of the advantages is it needs to be mined too, so extra rewards for the miner. This are called second layer solutions and intent to make everything faster. Remember when internet was super slow? Well, not slow now that it is on it’s 7th layer. If this extra layers are in the form of blockchains thay would need to be mined.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:56:41
Thanks man, you are a bro. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:37:21
And meanwhile i missed the whole fucking dip waiting for kraken to get my funds. Thanks kraken, you just cost me 0,25 bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:09:17
Spent the whole afternoon yesterday trying to earn a couple mBTC, sold at one point, bought back in at 500 bucks less. Did that 3 times yesterday and it worked out great. Last night bought back in at 14,300€ and called it a night pretty happy about myself. Woke up at 13,600€ and silly me decided to keep at it so i sold again hoping to buy at 13,000. It was amazing how it started to go up inmediatly and now it’s 14,900 €. Fuck me.

People who have tons of it will support it and people who use it for daily live. Nowdays, no one bats an eye at having a modem in their house. In the 90’s it was rare, now some countries call it a human right. We don’t worry it may cost 30€ more to get the movies we used to get with free radio waves. To talk to people that we used to talk to with the phone and common mail. To get the news the newspaper used to give us. I honestly think this will be a non-isue in one hundred years. I agree in 2017 bitcoin is not widespread enough to be used as currency, but technology will sort those problems out. Now it is easier to change your bitcoins to fiat to use them, but the goal is to one day not have to. Come for the gainz, stay for the tech and freedom.

Bitbox has 25€ shipping!
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:33:20
it caught me off guard too. I didn´t have fiat at the exchange, and transfer are a few days so i started selling and buying at 500 bucks intervals and added like 0.04 to my stash.
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:30:01
I bought the day before bcash insider trading and fucking piccaso. I year to convince my wife and just when we agree to get into it this happens. Fuck me this can not go up fast enough.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:37:00
Yes but stressfull. I wished i’d had a transfer on the way. Like i did when it was 14,000€ and when it got there it was 12,000 and i was pretty happy. If i knew it would keep going to 9000 i would had saved some to not risk my coins day trading.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:21:20
Meanwhile i have spent the whole correction waiting for kraken to recieve my funds. Hope it dips again today or tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:18:05
Is this standard?
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:54:46
It could be worthless if there are no miners, but at least you count on a few remaining, who could be enough as computers get better and better. 
What is gold worth? You can’t eat it, can’t built a house, can’t wear it, too soft to make tools and weapons... what’s it really worth? Nothing. We use it because the europeans thought it was worth killing for. When Columbus first got to the caribbean it was worth crap  to them. Oboriginals have it to them in exchange for mirrors, good deal for them at the time, since mirrors are actually incredibly useful. Even before that, when europeans got to India, indians used sea shells, gold was crap. But as the Indians saw the europeans were so willing to do anything for it, they raised prices. those prices were still lower than in Europe, but as the cheap indian gold became abundant the prices came down there to. The price in India and Europe became the same, that’s what markets do. Gold fever came over India. Mesopotamia on the other hand never had it. They used barley as money. But the barley couldn’t function as a store of wealth for long, since it is perishable. If you didn’t use it fast enough it could decompose. That’s why we have beer by the way. 
Before the agricultural revolution we didn’t even have money. Gold, money, it’s worth something only in our minds. It’s a subjective experience, shared by many, so it is intersubjective. A merchant believes in gold because he knows the other merchants also take gold. So he can take gold from his clients and take it to other merchants and get things for himself. If all the merchants stop accepting gold he is going to have a bad time. This situation has happened. You need a trusted third party to make sure everybody keeps taking gold. 
That’s essentially what coins are. When people living in the old roman empire saw a gold coin with the Emperor’s face that just meant that the Emperor promised that all the coins carry X amount of gold and that he makes sure everyone inside his empire either accepts it or dies. But people started pollishing out the borders of the gold coin to produce gold dust before returning the smaller coins to circulation. To have their own reserve of gold. So goverments changed gold coins for cheaper coins (bronze, niquel) “backed” by gold. Then they made even cheaper “backed” paper notes. Then there was not enough gold so they made “goverment-backed” paper. This is what rulers have been doing for milenia. Now with computers they don’t even have to print it, 90 % of dollars exist only inside computers. Just like bitcoin. But instead of being decentralized like bitcoin, it exist inside the servers of banks, federal reserve. What happens when this central authority is Maduro? Or the Liberian central bank? Or if the federal reserve keeps making more worthless dollars, decreasing the value of the ones you have? Or if they get hacked? Worthless. 
But then? Why were the damned Europeans so fucking intrested in gold? Because you can’t fake gold, or a diamond. Alquemists tried for long. So it was a good store of wealth and a proof of work you can’t fake. Central authorities have committed all kinds of atrocities to get more gold and maintain control over it. They have tortured, starved people, genocide. Destroyed nature to mine it. But that is all the worth it has. It doesn’t perish like barley and it can’t be faked. Just like bitcoin. Math and science solved the problem of proof of worth way more elegantly than politics, war and metalurgy.
So i think as long as people say bitcoin is worth something they will support the blockchain. People who have millions in bitcoin will need to. In 2100 i hope computers and solar/wind energy are advanced enough for it to be a non-issue, just like you don’t hear people complaining about their TV, phone, internet, etc, using electricity. Besides, after the last bitcoin is mined the GPU arms race can stop. Also, If adoption is widespread, a large amount of people will just use their regular PC and not specialized hardware.

I read the article. But i feel this bull run peak is different, it peaked, it crashed not too hard and peaked again. In a week. No it seems it is slowly going down but not crashing hard to about 80% like on the fractals in the article. This looks more like the [micro bubbles] (&lt; in the volatilic rise fase. I say we haven’t seen the bull rise yet.
Edit: added photo.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:19:37
Why is this peak different? Its a twin peak or it is taking too long to crash.
