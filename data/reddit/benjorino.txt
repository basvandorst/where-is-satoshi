China is enormous though, and apparently a good chunk of the mining is done in Sichuan and Yunnan which have a ton of hydroelectric power and don't burn much coal. I guess there aren't stats available about the distribution of bitcoin mining in China, and I'm sure that a decent chunk of it is also done with coal-power... however since renewables are much more likely to be creating surplus than coal, it seems sensible that they would be exploited for bitcoin mining.

I think they usually just turn off the turbines - by locking the blades in place - when they are producing too much power. This is because our current energy storage solutions are not great.

This is actually gradually becoming true in many places.

Umm look at Venezuela right now, they just announced exactly this.

Looks like you'd make them reach their goal too! I think it's a great idea.

Ah I was imagining a wind turbine sorry. Yeah I see what you are saying - that they don't *produce* extra electricity - but the point is that they could. They have surplus *capacity*. So why not use it for crypto? No loss, everyone wins.

Tommy Robinson is a grade-A bellend and has been for years. He was told he risked getting some paedophile’s cases thrown out if he didnt stop harassing them and filming them outside court, did it anyway, spent a short spell in prison.... and now he’s a hero to some random Americans? I dont get it.

The closest he's ever come to outing a paedophile is when he told that 15 year old girl she was 'pretty fit for a muslim' on twitter. Class act that guy.

I only learnt fairly recently that this is considered a non-PC term in the US. In the UK it doesn't typically have that connotation. Also if you talk about 'Asian people' in the UK, people will think you mean people from India/ Pakistan/ Bangladesh. "Oriental" is used quite commonly within China itself too.

Or the USD has to totally fuck up.

Blockchain.info gives you your private keys though right? Is them knowing the private keys the issue?

Overall, I have made a fair sum of money. I could have made a lot more for sure, but the fact still remains that I made some easy money, and it's difficult to feel regret about that.

They aren't infinitely divisible, but they can be divided into 100 million satoshis. Since there are 21 million possible bitcoins in total, your proposed destruction of 99.99999999% of them would leave 0.0021 bitcoins left... i.e. 21 million (indivisible) satoshis. I dunno if that indivisibility would destroy the bitcoin economy, but it wouldn't be good.
