Wow. I can't believe the US Army is hunting down Satoshi. This is crazy.

What did you think their business model was? Giving you below-cost gift cards?
Yes, they're tracking how you use these cards and selling the correlated information back to their clients.

Why are you using two party transactions?
@_date: 2014-06-14 23:39:55
No. This is to piggy back on Secondmarket's bids. Secondmarket ponys up the $200k, not you.

I guess you're not a native speaker of English (German?), but that sentence is definitely not speaking about brand promotion.

So you didn't have a single project with a testable hypothesis? Teachers these days...

And what I mean is that you don't understand the differences between a transaction network and a currency.

No one's maintaining a fixed BTC / USD rate. Describe how a speculative attack would play out.

2014 not 2013.

Yes, and they're being addressed by more centralization.

After the frenzied Bitcoin is too far from the gold standard.

All the more exciting.

Shut up. Don't encourage fraud.

Chinese will just cash out on the black market. Withdrawls from some exchange is completely irrelevant now.
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:45:04
Idiot, don't post things like this. You are messing up the price. I thought COINdesk was on our side.
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:57:52
Hey loser bitcoin is the future. You can get on the train or be left behind.
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:34:51
Yeah, because that worked so great with China. Give me a break.

Dogecoin and Bitcoin are the same? Obviously you don't understand a 50+1% attack or the risk of a blockchain fork.

Stupid bitpay. **THIS** is why the price is so damaged. :(
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:37:21
Sounds like you'd have a rough time at a trading desk.
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:08:05
Bitpay is the **same** as cashing out. Cashing out lowers the price and **damages** the market cap. ***Peroid.***
@_date: 2013-12-23 16:31:21
This sounds like a terrible idea. If you're gifting coins, please also give the gift of sole ownership.

Thanks for sending me to the ghana medical help bitpay page the other day. Definitely open to sending coin to any charities that are accepting bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-15 02:23:47
Why do you want to sell them?
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:10:26
Mess up the price? I just made 30% buying near the low. Sounds like you have sour grapes for not having skin in the game.
The overraction to China news is the best thing to happen in a week.

He's saying the bottom is around 400 usd/btc.
@_date: 2013-12-23 16:34:49
Cool - so they'll keep a few hundred thousand around in Bitcoin. Not going to sway the markets in any meaningful way.

First off:
* Don't use Paypal for Bitcoin.
* Don't use Paypal for Bitcoin.
* Don't use Paypal for Bitcoin.
Secondly, BTC-e support *is* eventually responsive if you wait a bit.
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:33:40
What? This is great news. BTC China is working on the problem. Once they fix it, there will be a rush of new buyers since the Chinese realize that bitcoin is the only way to get significant money out of their oppressive country.
Even if it doesn't work out, at least we'll have China out of the market. Either way, the price is going to skyrocket.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:18:13
Feel the same. For the last few years, I've been celebrating black Friday by donating and volunteering at local charities.
This year, bitcoin let me do the same internationally. Check out the "[charities]( section of BCBF.
I was always reluctant to donate outside of my home country because of how banks/paypal eat into my donation with stupidly steep fees. Bitcoin changes all of that.
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:00:50
BTC in China isn't going anywhere. Bobby Lee posted an update just today.
Everyone please downvote this fearmongering.
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:27:42
You are harming the bitcoin price. Stop now before we make you.
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:53:05
Heh, I've bookmarked your post just to revisit how ridiculous it sounds in a year.
Can't wait to hear you whining about not buying into the biggest monetary event of the century. Things like this happen once or twice in a lifetime, and you're missing out.
@_date: 2013-12-21 16:27:02
Litecoin? Idiot.
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:03:48
Uh, please DO NOT post negative news about bitcoin in this subbreddit. Thank you.
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:20:52
I don't think you understand Bitcoin. As China clamps down, they're going to lose their grip on the Bitcoin market. They're just missing out on their one opportunity to regulate this wonderful innovation. After this, it's all going to the gray/black markets which are HUGE in China.
We haven't seen the last of the Chinese in this market. Who cares about BTC China?
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:24:00
THIS IS HUGE

You aren't taking this into account: an exploitative party has a higher-than-expected rate of return for "mining."

I suppose this is how other Reddit communities feel when we come barging in with uBTC in-hand.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:32:23
Please do not post anything negative against bitcoin on this subreddit!

* Selling migrated to other exchanges with higher prices. (Why would you sell at an exchange you can't withdraw from?)
