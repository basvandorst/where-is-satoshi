I think a medium popcorn would be fine. Gotta watch that waistline.

What tangible good is Bitcoin composed of that has such intrinsic value? Electrons? Some decidedly non-tangible store of the value of computation that went into hashing the block it came from?

In what way does "digital value" differ from more common definitions of value?


Not when there are open source applications that do the same job. 


Are you really asking if the greatest communication network ever devised has value?


Facebook is a service, its value to users is derived entirely by the work Facebook does to mediate communication, not by the electrons transmitted by ones internet service provider.


Gold also has an arrangement of protons and neutrons that allow those electrons to be localized in a useful and tangible manner. Electrons themselves have no value except as carriers of either data or energy.


Low, but nonzero.


OK, so let's say I want to take my bitcoin out of circulation and use it for something. Paper money will at least burn, as your Zimbabweans can attest. Gold is valuable in that it it's properties are useful in electronic circuits. Sea shells can be made into jewelry, or ground into powder for industrial uses. My bitcoin is just a string of digits, useful only in that we've voluntarily agreed that it's worth so-and-so.

Such as?
Surely, you're referring to blockchain technology and not bitcoin itself?




That still doesn't invalidate the point...


Who said anything about belittling people because they use bitcoin? I think bitcoin is awesome, just not fundamentally distinct from any other fiat currency created by arbitrary order and holding value based on mutual consensus rather than being made of something useful or backed by a stock of the same.

Does it? 
What about the Yuan Chinese, who pioneered fiat currency and who did not begin to formally codify their law until their fourth emperor?
What about the Iraqi Swiss Dinar, which retained it's value even after the government that created it collapsed and *appreciated* in value in Kurdish regions of the country when Saddam instituted a replacement currency?


Then why did Satoshi's version of the Bitcoin algorithm become the standard, and why are there so many competing digital currencies based on their work?


You seem to be implying this does not also apply to greenbacks, which were created by authoritarian decree but hold value only by voluntary consensus.

FTFY.

Satoshi Nakamoto and Gavin Andresen are an authority. Not an elected one, nor one appointed by royal decree, nor any other arbitrary limitation of what constitutes 'authority', but an authority on decentralized software and secure transactions that absolutely grants them the power to establish fiat. How do I know? He/they created a currency; wrote the software that describes it's function, started the network that sets it's value and enables transactions, and maintains the software repositories that establish an authoritative version of the algorithm.

Check out the original context for this argument:
@_date: 2015-08-01 19:05:29
How does that differ from an elected representative's or an un-challenged king's proclamation?


Yes, the code itself has anti-counterfeiting measures to ensure that each transaction conducted in bitcoin is genuine. Only genuine bitcoins can be created and spent, so only genuine Bitcoin code can run on Satoshi's network. The penalty for not running Satoshi's code is not being able to conduct business in Bitcoin. 


How does the financial incentive to create currencies by fiat invalidate my argument when it's wielded by the  authors of microcode, rather than legal code? 


Likewise, I argue that the bitcoin source code does not represent a "request", rather a decree that created Bitcoin on the authority of Alan Turing's work on general-purpose computers. 


What's hidden about that?


How does one 'subtly' remove the backing of a currency? You're conflating silver certificates with greenbacks just because we called both of them "dollars" at one point or another.

I put it to you that a distinguishing feature of fiat currencies is not that they were created by a government. Nearly all currencies are. Rather, that fiat currencies are so called because they are established by arbitrary mandate as opposed to commodity currencies like gold coins that are made of valuable materials, or representative currencies whose value is pegged to that of a tangible good like your coke note example, or the old gold-standard-based dollar.


Bitcoin is a fiat currency, the only distinction is that the arbitrary mandate that created it was algorithmic rather than legislative. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 15:08:20
I know how bitcoin works technologically, what I disagree with is the idea that bitcoins and dollars are functionally distinct when one of them was created by an arbitrary mandate of a government and the other by an equally arbitrary programmatic fiat. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 19:59:24
Fiat money can be treated as a commodity by a government for the purposes of taxation (they often are by governments of countries who conduct significant business in a foreign currency), but that doesn't mean that it's composed of materials which have non-currency uses. 
@_date: 2015-08-02 13:57:37




Which is ostensibly representative of the will of the people, hence being ostensibly voluntary as well.




And if Americans didn't want to use Dollars, they could have elected a new government any time in the last 200 years to make a change.




Are you suggesting this occurred in secret?

Politicians don't print money, they design legislation that specifies how and when an unelected central bank will buy bonds from commercial banks, "printing" money in the process.
Likewise, bitcoin miners don't print money, the bitcoin algorithm specifies how and when more bitcoins are added to the supply. Bitcoin miners are more like commercial banks in that they do not create money, but are the initial recipients of newly-created money.

Bitcoin was established by an algorithm. "Fiat" is defined as an arbitrary order. What's more fixed and arbitrary than the design of software?
@_date: 2015-08-01 19:18:50


Care to quote where I'd implied anything to the contrary?


You're the one trying to prove that commodity money can be composed of something other than valuable, physical materials:


"[Commodity money]( is created from a good, often a precious metal such as gold or silver, which has uses other than as a medium of exchange (such a good is called a commodity)"
The string of digits of which a Bitcoin is composed has ***no uses*** other than as a medium of exchange. 


Thank you for your contrition. =3
