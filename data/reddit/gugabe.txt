Being able to accurately evaluate company worth better than the market =/= great macroeconomic sense, though. I know a few crazy-successful futures/derivatives traders who do essentially everything on technical analysis, without having concern for the economic fundamentals of what they're trading.

It creates itself, really. The markets are purely psychological and thus it's good to find places where you'll find traders working off a similar market understanding.
I haven't really traded BTC, but I've got 5 years experience as a proprietary STIR/FX trader, and it's something that comes up a lot with newbies. There's no logical reason for a lot of levels to work, but you need to work off something that'll produce momentum in of itself or you'll get smacked by the angry hand of the market.

The idea is that enough other people are following TA that it creates a level by pure force of will, rather than that it tracking an inherent movement in the market.
It's why stuff like Fibonacci retracements are still used, since you'll still find some traders working off them.

I'd rather not take pics of my resume, but I'm currently working out of an Australian Prop-trading firm called Propex. I tend to specialize in the curve, but dabble in AUD-focused FX as necessary to hedge. I know guys with 20-year on-and-off Financial Instrument trading careers with similar opinions on the matter. Most Technical Analysis has little inherent worth, but is useful in the sense that it frequently presents a signal that you can be confident you'll find other buyers/sellers at.
