Just buy bitcoin. It's not worth getting into the mining game this late in the game. Unless you have the money to throw at the equipment

Was going to invest $500 into bitcoin. In early 2012. But my wife said it was a waste of money and quote "you might as well throw the money in the garbage". Fast forward to end of last year, she did the math at what that 500 dollars would have been. Now she fully supports me investing lol.

Mhm, I mean there's no guarantee I wouldn't have cashed out after it reached like $25 or $100.

I've used them for few years now, never a issue. I'm always sure to transfer my coins though to my own wallet.

$8. I was going to invest $500. But the wife told me not to waste our money.... 
I eventually bought in, but much later :(

I too buy from coinbase. I'd consider myself a novice. I did alot of alt coin mining for a few years but I pretty much just stick to BTC and LTC nowadays. 
Anytime I buy, I send everything to my trezor, even my digibyte now since Trezor supports it. I'll usually then put $50 or so into my mobile wallet to use when I'm out and about and bitcoin is available to purchase something.

I wish I could upvote twice, one for the office reference and another for the username. You're one of gods own prototypes, not fit for mass production.
