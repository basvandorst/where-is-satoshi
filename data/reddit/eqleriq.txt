You don't know shit about the bailouts. Look into who received what and how, even if they weren't making "risky bets" and you'll see how the economy was stabilized. 
The part you're missing is that the taxpayers are the ones who benefit from "interest" on savings account and profits from other financial tools, but I guess they don't want to hear that the way those are gotten are VIA those bets, that guess what, sometimes lose.
It's one thing to take a shit on the entire system, but it is a level of retardation beyond to claim that "people" are swindled by the same systems they serve to protect.

There were tons of buyers/sellers but those -- doing absolutely nothing differently than coinbase besides KYC/AML following -- were "illegitimate." Zzz.
So yes, boo hoo, coinbase was the first to centralize and turn bitcoin into a government protocol.

I am not just randomly typing a response to you, in this language I've also enclosed my seed words. You will never be able to get into my safe keeping because you do not know the pattern that I am using for the words. This is not "security by obscurity" any more than my remembering my password. I can even give you a direct clue: 1245. You are no closer to breaking my security with this information than if you didn't have it, so your premise is bullshit.
The only thing more secure (which is also the most secure) is if I don't even know my password, it is generated for me and hidden away in some secure location where only I can access it. 
Nothing beats security better than physical coercion!

The spread would be absorbed in the relative valuation based on one "main coin," just like any other currency.
In this endgame state, it would be no different than trading foreign currencies to try and "profit" from the relative swings.
In the end, there are what, maybe 2 or 3 popular methods of processor usage to generate coins? 
The pointless exercise claim regarding altcoins is not true if you filter out these parallel processing uses. IE, for the last month if you were pointing your processing at litecoin you'd have made better use of your overheads than if you pointed it at bitcoin (and your asics idle). But if you have an asic solving the bitcoin maths, any coin using that same system will always have a valuation relative to the cost it takes your rig to generate the coin, which is based wholly on the difficulty and the valuation. There have been many points in history where even farming the most obscure shitcoin was far more profitable than sticking with bitcoin from this point of view. But that more or less is obliterated by the # of coins that are worth $0 and were always a waste to mine.
Price discovery is a hell of a drug.
In terms of utility? I dunno it's like trying to divine how good of a CEO a newborn baby would be.

But I'm sure that this has nothing to do with making wild gains on shorts.
Where did that asshole with the twitter feed about shorting BTC fails go? I know people crushing this market with the same tools they use to squeak profits out of fractions of a penny shift.
The funny thing is they're all "hodlers" they just know they can, worst case scenario, close the short with the actual bitcoin.
Do you realize how many people are going to be literally getting 15-19k per btc when thhose contracts are up?
LOL that you think anyone is legitimately "buying in" at any real volume over a couple k, i know more people who bought in above 15k just to have the btc in hand for their shorts. So now they make the 15k per one and rebuy at 9800.

This is not the case with coinmarketcap
The issue was that they rolled out a feature that people basically misread.
It's pretty much out in the open "how coinmarketcap works." Do they have a responsibility to warn everyone that all prices were going to change radically with this new filtration/feature? 
You can easily make your own coinmarketcap. Just pull all of the bitcoin exchanges and present your math at figuring out what the "one value" is. 
For example, I feel that their "bitcoin dominance" is an empty statistic, but there it is right up top and people seem to care about the shadowy math behind "dogecoin" taking up space in the crypto landscape... 
i could make my own coinmarketcap and remove all of the shit exchanges, remove all the shit coins and present my own valuation. 
I could use any number of other valuation tools or subsets of data. 
People use coinmarketcap because it has been consistently the most maximalist set of data. 
So when you say "we need decentralized" I agree -- but you are asserting there is some sort of selectivity that simply is not there. I would agree that the potential for selectivity is a jar of poison teetering over the well (the bitcoin.com fiasco). Buy instantly with creditcard going to a specific site screams of this selectivity...
I use another site that currently values bitcoin $100 less than coinmarketcap is presenting, and uses far fewer datapoints from only the "major" exchanges.
So really, until decentralized websites exist, someone's gotta pay bills to run these info displays and that someone will always be a point of weakness.

The point that you're conveniently missing "for memes sake" is that if you sell a house for $1,000,000 and have to pay ~$250,000 in capital gains tax but you just have a bunch of bitcoins, you still need to come up with $250k in FIAT to pay your taxes.
And then when you go to sell the bitcoins to come up with your $250,000, you pay taxes on the sale of the bitcoins.
Selling $1M of bitcoins, another $250k taxes. So instead of selling a house for $1M and getting $750k post tax, you're getting $500k
The only relevant warning for bitcoins increase/decrease in valuation is hey, what if it crashes and you can't sell it to pay for your taxes on the house sale? Otherwise, it's just to remember to pay taxes on those fat gains.

 It's funny when people see this type of thing and think they've discovered something new or it is a mystery to solve. It's been happening for years and is why the mempool is shitting the bed.
Simple math: you mine thousands of coin a year, you spend X% of that on shitting out dust to clog the mempool, pay no fee when you mine/discard your own tx, and increase avg tx while decreasing # tx per block. 
As long as your block mined % and dust works out to profit from the bloated tx fees, uh, you do that. Miners lose by having emptier blocks with faster confs

first of all, my anecdote includes that spurring of vendor adoption, so your point is ... pointless.
secondly, snore, why bother? bitcoin failed as a currency, lightning + segwit will save it and people will adopt whenever it makes sense to.
reading people getting clubbed over the head trading digi currency in person and subway accepting it whatever, is such a short term mindset.
If bitcoin works AT ALL, you're a fool to spend even a minor amount of bitcoin as the valuation is going to make anyone even casually investing up to this point a major multiple of their money.
These things have been discussed since 2009, where you can extrapolate the ceiling value of 1btc as essentially 1/21,000,000 of all money in the world. What fraction of that do you think is realistic in 10 years?
All you are accomplishing by spending bitcoin is allowing shit like bitpay to accumulate massive amounts and act as a centralizing force in the longterm.
My own tinfoil tea-leaf reading: Vendors will never, ever be the ones "accepting bitcoin." It will 100% be some sort of debit/bank conversion directly. They set up their same network they always pay into and you slide some officially issued card, beep bop boop, bitcoin happened behind the scenes. They get either bitcoin or fiat, they don't care, because it's just lines on a spreadsheet that their bank looks at and converts on the fly.

Someone who's volume requires updating at a monthly pulse.
The part you're omitting here is that tx fees will not be that high when most of the tx are offset to an L2 solution.
Say you're a mining pool that pays out a more or less predictable, high-volume amount that floods the chain. Wow, now it doesn't.
Same goes for exhanges or traders.
And with the pressure off on the blockchain, the asswipes spamming it with dust have 0 incentive to, which will ironically drive the tx fees down. Having L2 as a feasible option naturally suppresses tx mean, even without direct use

ITT: stories about how people profited from bitcoin. 
swap bitcoin with "i had stocks in comcast" or "i had stocks in EA" ... "that I sold to allow me to pay for ________________" and you have the exact same stories.
These anecdotes are no different than MLM/Pyramid "all I did was send $1 to the 10 names on the list and added mine to the bottom of the list and forwarded it! Thank you so much MLM/Pyramid! Please share how being the lesser of the greater fools allowed you to profit!"
stories you don't hear, but could and should: all my fiat was seized by the bankrupting government but I had bitcoin that was untouchable (NOT "and I was able to cash out" because humm, how, since you'd have to convert to that same fiat?)
The closest i've seen was the person who lost their house in a fire but had their wallet on USB. That'd be great if everyone's bank was a pile of paper sitting in a box on the floor of their house or something.
Yes, it is cynical, but photos of lambos with BTC license plates and massive donations to foundations or people are all the same story: bitcoin used to be worth X, but now it's worth X*(Y&gt;1) so I used those gains to pay for things. 
In my opinion they give the wrong impression of bitcoin. Are you saying that if someone bought over the current valuation bitcoin is "less good" or "useful"? That they just have to hang on and one day they too could donate to the sick orphan kitten foundation?

What? This is absurd. People keep conveniently take some things literally and others philosophically. It's like picking and choosing Bible verses or something. Anyone who was reading those listservs in 2009/10 knew the endgame were L2 protocols. Bottom fucking line. I don't see the b'cash crew refuting that, so I'm not sure what mischaracterization of a paraphrase has lead you to believe the bullshit that L2 = centralization according to anyone actually developing code? Who? Citation needed.


Yes it is clear. It isn't a fucking risk to "centralization" it is directly a centralizing force.  Just like mining pools are, now. b'cash is 51% vulnerable due to this, right now, as we speak. If you understand what a blockchain 20x bigger than the current one would require from a support standpoint on a node, then you understand how it limits controls of the nodes. What if the nodes were so big only a government could maintain them? Or massive for-profit entity? That's no risk of centralization, it's just, you know, centralization.
Do you understand how miners can selectively inflate the pools by spamming dust? Do you understand how that works at near zero cost to the miners?

I don't have much problem with his chopping down of regulation + government intervention. I do have a problem with the replacement for that being some sort of religiously driven government.
The issue for me are all of the mysterious policies and regulations that would necessarily follow the logic of a "christian" government. 
You can't on one hand state "i want little or no govenment" while insinuating that a bible is the ultimate governance + should form policies. That simple paradox is an easy enough talking point to blast him out of any realistic contention for power.
Where's the candidate that wants no government intervention except for corporations that represent people? Anarcho-syndicalism?
eg, i agree that "federal land" should have been privatized long ago but since it wasn't I think the government's role should be towards a fair (lul yeah right) distribution.
Likewise stripping federal oversight of schools and environment would be great if we weren't in a late-game capitalist scenario where losing control via the gov means monolithic corporations take it over with their relatively overwhelming majority.

not "batching payments" necessarily.
it's that every time they transacted, they created/used new change addresses, many of which amounted to dust.
Say you had 1 bitcoin, and a transaction fee would be 0.01 bitcoin.
Now, imagine that 1 bitcoin is spread over 10,000 *wallets*, each with 0.0001 bitcoin. You literally cannot move those 0.0001 bitcoin as the fee to move btc is 0.01. Not the same as addresses.
So that mismanagement of change / UTXO lead to a gross amount of unmovable coin, you "have" 1 btc but it is completely unmovable.

On the other, those resources should be going to development.

why would the dollar collapse just because crypto is an option?
"we all" couldn't have lambos... that's asinine. Right now a lambo is X bitcoin but in the future it might be 100(X) bitcoin. 
Everyone is in a frenzy because the cost of things in $ is more or less unchanged by crypto, but as adoption increases those valuations would increase. 
That said, if mining 1 bitcoin costs $100,000, the assumption is that somewhere, someone is getting that $100,000.
simply put, the dollar could always require using the dollar to pay off whatever debts: taxes, loans, etc. 
There are ~15-20 million millionaires in the world. Every bitcoin in existence in over 100 years would have to be near $1,000,000 to simply double that number, never mind how many of the already existing 15-20 million are just compounding or augmenting their wealth. and that's not counting the ~1500 billionaires.
There would be relatively few -- if any -- jobs impacted by the loss of banking middlemen on the transactions that crypto would take over. As we've seen, 3rd party is still necessary as an interface until volatility dies down... which is when, exactly? You're either a fool or flush with cash if you take bitcoin now and are able to safely offset the risk (and eat the costs of making those crucial fiat conversions)

You were actually defending shitbase for rolling out b'cash "unannounced"... even though every single exchange that will bother with b'cash had crazy spikes in activity right before that launched. Zzz.
You talk past people and repeat yourself because you want to leave that nauseating, icky feeling that one must have dealing with shitcoins to try to turn a profit... the irony is the powers that be had 99.99999% of their b'cash/btc 7+ years ago so it doesn't fucking matter, they're profitting on the way up and down with BOTH. Which do you prefer? Decentralized liecoin with dirty tricks marketing run by basically scammy scumbags in the space going back to a forum where they were ostracized and just annoying personalities that didn't contribute anything of worth? Bigger blocks + no volume / valuation that is piggybacking on bullshit exchanges locking it down? Or crappy tx fees with promises of solutions When It's Done[tm] backed by people who have hundreds + thousands of bitcoin and/or agendas to harness it in a centralized manner because they don't value the transaction fees in FIAT, they see it as a tiny % Of their massive holdings from 6-7 years ago. Pick yr poison. But don't pretend one is glass of water.
But yes, lets pretend this is a deep philosophy. Literally ZERO people involved in actually developing or understanding the software ramifications of a blockchain are involved in b'cash, they're all crypto mercenaries looking to turn profits with whatever shit they get gullible dorks to swallow. 
So pardon me if I find it a bit trite when someone who has 0 time spent actually contributing to the code wants to "pow wow" about how the software should be.

Segwit inflates the block sizes but where he's wrong is in assuming the blocks are not being fluffed by miners right now, who lose the incentive to do that with block weighting. So yes, a pathological miner could inflate the block... but... why would they?
Segwit is the stopgap solution for a reprieve in blocks and becomes irrelevant vis a vis block sizes with a l2 solution. That's why there's no hurry to get segwit in place and various shills on this forum have a hardon for ANYTHING that will allow miner manipulation of block sizes + more centralization. 
People using light wallets are NOT the network. Running a node is a huge amount of bandwidth both disk space + internet connectivity-wise, and even doubling that (let alone 4x, 10x... 20x) is so silly that I can't believe anyone is talking shit about how infeasible it actually is.

That said, I'm not sure what part you're concerned about? If you know you're going to send 10,000 transactions to someone what is the hangup with mitigating that via channels? Even if you end up only reducing that to 9,999 that's still an improvement, but realistically the entities that benefit the most have more predictable, regulsr transaction patterns

What you're saying, even if true, is only relevant to your buy-in prices. "bitcoin is down less than other coins" as a generalized statement is silly.
There is literally a 6 week window of bitcoin purchases where you've lost money on btc. Out of 7+ years. Stating "having invested in alts" in that 6 week window outperformed btc? Obviously that's possible.
Now expand that until any alt reaches parity with btc. Now, go further. Spoiler: you can always hit a point where bitcoin outperforms ALL alts, that's the valuation advantage. Shrug.

Segwit had multiple reasons for implementation, and wasn't 100% about block size. You just keep saying some dogshit about how it is just as centralizing without qualifying that statement, and bring up a small block issue. 
The part you're omitting, skipping and avoiding is how segwit is CENTRALIZED in any way. It has the potential to have larger block sizes, obviously, but block weighting and witness data in the middle makes weight, not size, the mitigating factor and essentially becomes a dynamic size allowing for volume scaling. 
Not a fixed, flat block size dictated by mining mafias who want to be able to control their dust spam and ensure "full blocks" and the ability to inflate tx costs by essentially controlling the floor to get into a block. With segwit that entire practice becomes pointless + expensive. 
So yes, in theory segwit with pathological miners can be way way larger than current blocks! But nobody in the world would do that, the spam would cease, because they couldn't profit from it. They'd be throwing cash away while not increasing the minimum tx fee to make it into a block.
In short, you come across as concern trolling when just stating things in pithy short sentences without any validation or reference. There are thousands of crap posts like yours that go into no detail and just say "things are this way." Who does that work for? On one hand you have new users who understand 1% of any of the meat and potatoes posts here sorta/kinda piecing it together but getting this general feeling that "segwit bad! pointless!" and on the other hand you have verbose posts with detail that can only react to this trolling with this amount of effort.

there have been studies that show 8MB is a magic limit? That's idiotic. The entire point of stopping block inflation like that is that it centralizes nodes. Do you realize how big the blockchain would be, and how much bandwidth it would take up, if 8MB blocks were in place since the beginning? There'd be a lot less nodes, and it would be impossible to run them on home internet accounts.
Do you realize how big it would be in 2yrs projected? We're talking server farms.

the problem with this is 99.999999% of people in the world had no idea what bitcoin was in 2012. so no, she didn't do that. she was busy without internet making minimum wage.
the vast majority of people in the world have no personal internet. and a massive amount of those who do are computer illiterate. Healthy estimates put 70% of the USA alone as computer illiterate past opening email or using facebook.
So this horseshit that the poor + disenfranchised made "microdecisions" about bitcoin is just neckbeard insanity coming from the cognoscenti bubble that is Reddit. 
The generalized "person looking at Reddit" doesn't even represent 1% of the world. But yes, every minimum wage worker learned everything they could about something as abstract as cryptocurrency and "made a choice." Fucking stupid.

@_date: 2018-01-31 19:18:36
Nah, it's just because of it's valuation + volatility. It's not "not a currency" just because you declare it. 
THE ENTIRE PURPOSE of using bitcoin (then rebuying) is entirely showing that it has a use case and should be implemented en masse as an option. That's it. It is not more convenient, but with more adoption and technology incoming, it will soon be a cheaper + more resilient / less capitalist shitmongering than any other option. 
Steam removed it due to the transaction bullshit from the dust attacks. This is because it wasn't transparent to them. Resolve that with lightning and ta-dah, there is 0 reason to not accept crypto anymore. 
Which is why payment companies are adopting bitcoin, they know that they're going to be obsolete as soon as crypto enables instant, fee-less and trust-less transfers. 
You don't seem to grasp how much of the fees + service costs offered by payment companies are based entirely on the fraud that occurs. 
Offering a system that has guaranteed 0% fraud for near 0 cost and overhead? Yeah, what vendor would "logically" want that when they can put their balls on Paypal's chopping board with the promise they won't get chopped, for a low % fee taken out of every transaction. Hurp durp. I guess you've never had something reversed on you on Paypal, eh? 
I've heard this horseshit argument since the days of the 10k btc pizza. People who've entered into it and demand answers and results immediately spew this noxious vitriol about "what bitcoin is." Just pretend it is 2010 again and let the visionaries create the network while you make bold proclamations about your "sick bitcoin gains" necessitating the "use case" for bitcoin. 
TLDR: the use case for bitcoin is using it for goods and services. All this fiat conversion fuckery is newfriends pretending they're not the ones at the back of the human centipede
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:23:29


Sorry but your logic blows: if you could immediately replace it, why wouldn't you have just bought more in the first place?
It's like saying "OK, buy $10 of bitcoin, and spend it, but then immediately rebuy $10 of bitcoin."
If you had $20, why didn't you just buy $20 of bitcoin and use 1/2 of it on your transaction?
In all of bitcoins history the current price was still ATH for it's life aside from December and January. That's 2 months in its 108 month lifetime. 
So aside from those two months the correct answer would have been buy 100% of the bitcoin you could afford, if you had done that since 2009 you'd be very well off right now.
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:04:55
And why it is relevant is
One centralized price index proves that centralizing information allows "filtering" of the data that can drive markets. 
If CMC was not able to suddenly "recalibrate" its valuation, a lot of this wouldn't have happened. Even if innocent or otherwise trustworthy, trust basically needs to be eradicated.
The crypto mantra, and the earlier you learn this the better, ought to be 
**"If I have to trust it, it is a vulnerability that is exploitable."**
These price charts are open to filtration, editing and thus manipulation. You can open 4 or 5 exchange aggregators and they all have different values. And they all are honest with their math (though good luck repeatedly proving that). 
For example, unless there's some "provably true" systematic check in place, what's to stop an aggregator to create a controlled, minor, discrepancy?
In the case of CMC, the discrepancy wasn't minor, it was major, and it snowballed into action. It is one of the top websites in the world right now and not some aggregator that has 1000 people looking at it.
Imagine that the equivalent of CMC was an unchanging, decentralized ruleset that didn't require someone sitting at a computer to "make decisions"? Imagine it was a decentralized website? It's hard to assert that the price drop would have been equally as severe if that korean filtration didn't occur the way it did.
Obviously not laying blame fully here, but it was clearly a contributor. There are reasons for the drops, and knowing those and understanding them is not impossible.

You are wrong. It does not enable bigger blocks. It enables block weighting which would obviously possibly result in bigger blocks, but it makes the dust spamming and TX inflating that has happened to not be profitable any more, so the blocks would never scale until the volume demands it.
In short, it's dynamic blocksize, not "bigger blocks."
You are literally posting the opposite of truths. Banks want smaller blocks? WTF does that even mean? It's like you barely know how blockchain works.
Miners want bigger, flat blocks as they do the same amount of work and would get "more bounty" out of each block. They want FLAT valuation so that they can transaction spam blocks to inflate the TX minimum to be in the block. 
Segwit uses BLOCK WEIGHTING. IF someone went apeshit and spammed the chain just like they are doing, and have been doing for years, they could fill up a block many times larger than current blocks. But why would they do that? They'd risk losing all of the transactions they were spamming, in the process, WITHOUT INFLATING COSTS.
 
So yes, in times of high volume (that we've not even seen to date) you might go over the current blocksize SOMETIMES! Wow! That's totally the same as ALWAYS having a LARGER block. That's totally what "banks" want.
High fees don't cause shit regarding centralization. What does that even mean? High fees are a RESULT of centralization. Segwit would LOWER FEES across the board. bigger blocks work, UNTIL THEY DON'T, and that causes centralization on node implementation. static block sizes work towards centralization since you can game them at the mining side with spam transactions inflating avg TX cost being an acceptable loss.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:47:56


LOL you were clearly not around in 13/14 to state that the environment is anywhere the same. In 13 there were literally one or two monolithic entities that the valuation relied on, and they all toppled.

In your buy / spend / rebuy scenario:
you have spent $10 of fiat, 
are holding $10 bitcoin, 
used $10 of bitcoin,
spent $10 of fiat,
and are holding $10 of bitcoin.
In my buy use scenario 
you spent $20 of fiat,
are holding $20 of bitcoin, 
used $10 of bitcoin, and are holding $10 of bitcoin.
You actually save on fees if you buy more at once, rather than purchasing twice.
In both cases you've used the same amount of fiat, and end up with the same amount of purchasing, and end up with the same amount of BTC holding... the only difference is you didn't use whatever 3rd party centralized buyer/exchanger 2x, instead only 1x.
I specifically stated buy as much as you can afford. That includes portfolio balancing. If you're inevitably going to use bitcoin and be holding the same amount, in every instance in history except dec/january it would have been profitable to buy more, earlier.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:21:55
the better strategy is to spread anti-coinbase rhetoric so that people don't onboard with them, as they'll adopt segwit then the market demands it, not some shitball petition.
for example, even if you don't care if coinbase is supporting segwit, understand that the sustained blockchain dust attack has artificially inflated tx costs for miner benefits, and with segwit you'd see those tx costs diminish.
coinbase doesn't give a shit because they operate without it, and have nothing to lose from pumping b'cash for "cheaper rates."
people who are using coinbase with no cares regarding tx fees (early adopters with low btc valuation don't see $$$ lost, they just see it as an acceptable cost at high volumes) will keep on, keepin' on

just no. MtGox was 99.9% of the valuation of crypto, AND it was being manipulated easily, AND it was insolvent. 
the missing data here is what is the value of every single satoshi that exists. IE, what was the cost of mining it, what was it purchased for, what profits have been realized on it. 
A whale with 100,000 btc who obtained it when it was worth $0.001 is completely different than a whale who obtained it when it was worth $1,000, for example. 
The problem with "anonymous trading" is that there will NEVER be an accurate valuation of it since the threat always looms that a big player decides they're bored and they sell everything off. 
There are people out there that would still be multimillionaires if BTC dropped to even $100 and even $10. The number of those? Anyone's guess.

Bullshit. The more you spend, the more 3rd party intermediaries are hoarding bitcoin. The vendor you're using doesn't give a fuck about crypto, they're just seeing that some transactions (small, small minority) are cheaper than others. But they're getting fiat. 
The cost to entry for those vendors are people integrating the payment system onto their website or POS system. That's a cost that won't be recouped for a while even with "cheaper fees."
Anyone using bitcoin now is a fuckin dope, and they're goaded into believing they're "helping valuation" buy using 0.00000001% of the volume to buy a waifu pillow with giftcards paid for via bitpay or something. Zzz.
Crypto as an entity is not something that "needs adoption." It is something that will be harnessed by major commerce hubs as they see fit. And why would they not offer their own currency. 
We're back to the general store wild west where any entity can issue their own certificates. The difference is, they're all connected and valuated off of each other. You know, until they're not.
But are you trying to tell me that if Amazon or Paypal or eBay... or Apple, Google, Visa or whatever... starts their own crypto with some valuation relative to bitcoin that it won't all go tits up?
Have fun playing Wolf of Wall Street over this technology, but it's laughable to think that you're doing ANYTHING at this point by making a 3rd party vendor (or, you know, the guy on the corner selling xanny tabs for crypto) rich.
For the vast majority of the world their entry point into bitcoin is buying it from someone who bought in / mined at a pricepoint cheaper. 
Please give me your elevator pitch as to why they need to convert $ to BTC to buy things when they could "just spend the $"? And do it without saying "overthrowing the centralized banking system." 
Because as soon as you get this adoption you're talking about that remotely resembles a threat to that system, you best believe the powers that be will drop a hammer on it's use sooooo fast that it would literally be no different than using fiat since you'd have to go through a, get this, centralized banking system to obtain/use it.
Until then, using bitcoin is a way to shave points off of a fool's money. Sure dude, by giving bitpay bitcoins at a nice vig you're really fighting "the man."
A sane approach to this is to ride it out until adoption naturally occurs because the technology can be leveraged. That's it. You're not part of that. A bot could "use" bitcoin.

The "purpose of crypto" is to have the option of opting in or not, rather than being mandated to. Any government could say "ok, the law is you only can use exchanges X,Y,Z" to 100% kill the legality of using anything but those sanctioned (and insured, and protected) services. 
Many people do not mind regulations and protections that a bank offers.
Some of us cannot wait for layer2 banks as Hal Finney outlined, which reduces the number of channels an individual would need dramatically, and would offer multiple services. Want fractional reserve/lending? a L2 bank can do that. Want no such thing? A L2 bank can do that.
If you look at most of the volume on blockchain right now, it's done through KYC/AML regulated exchanges, where those exchanges get to profit off of being the prettiest girl in town (and have proven to be less than reputable and "self interested" like any other profit-driven entity). So I feel no remorse for their death at the hands of mega corporations entering the same game and being able to afford the same (and better) services at a premium. Oh, with an extra benefit that you don't send identification out into the ether in order to be allowed to use things, as you already have done that with any bank that would enter into things.
People willingly gave sensitive information to MtGox... which is where, now?
Again, I'd state the purpose is freedom/choice. You can wait for a decentralized exchange, you could never convert crypto to fiat, you could buy into the monolithic gov run exchanges (which you may already be doing with the popular options, for all you know).

It's not just the hard drive, it is also bandwidth.
Where does that end? The same forces clogging this current blocksize can clog any larger blocksize until nodes are pushed out of realistic implementation. In fact they're doing it so that it encourages this centralization. 
Doubling it? Sure, OK. Now what happens when to run a node requires 5x the drive capacity and bandwidth? How about 20x? How about 1,000x? 
Guess what, no consumer internet will support that and you're going from "just upgrade a hard drive" to "just buy a massive drive array that is expensive to run, with business level internet."

The skype logs are literally what people sound like when they're "making logs that can prove something later." ie bullshit
So yea read those skype logs, does that look like the conversation you'd have after losing that much money? No, because they know they'd get away with it.
And all the other names mentioned (haha wowgold boy bought a piece of the theft in mtgox? hahahah) crazy shady dealers with experience of how to get away with obscuring holdings and exploitation.
the bottomline is it is almost as trivial as it is to hack an exchange as it is to have one. and when you have one, it opens that trust vector that someone's controlling it and can orchestrate hacks.
like, mtgox was a shitpile bul the prettiest girl in town. flawed to its core. and someone sells it off, claims they "have nothing to do with it" and yet know all of the vulnerabilities? HAHA oh god.

It's hilarious to me that people still keep the metaphor "My money was on that exchange."  Nope.

their entire argument is that LN = third party = centralization.
They will never require LN, the goal is to up the blocks, right?
Think of it this way: at the point they'd have segwit/LN, they'd be identical to bitcoin except for the (now obviously useless) bigger blocks. So what would their argument be?
They'd literally be a company based on 1 guy who is competent enough to copy what core devs do on a shittily pseudo-branded fuck coin.
The other problem is that as soon as LN is in place, all that matters is retailers ACTUALLY USING IT. 
b'cash can "win" easily if they have the political power to get retailers to utilize whatever 2nd layer you can think of.
One of the potential endgames to crypto, is that the crypto itself is arbitrary and interchangeable based on a simple math formula, and that the networks that provide integration with transaction spaces are what matters. You could use any crypto to purchase any item, the end.
Everything leading up to that point is political (both vendor AND governmental) song and dance.

The point is the highest valued, most used blockchain is as close to official as you're going to get. b'cash shills like to position b'cash as the official, true bitcoin so pick your argument.
Really what this feigned concern trolling consists of is balking at the declaration of bitcoin as the official bitcoin. No no, this altcoin derivative that "we've declared" is better is the official coin, err, uh, there is no official coin!
In this context "official wallet" means the baseline wallet implementation by core developers. Any wallet that uses the bitcoin blockchain other than that is basically unofficial. This has absolutely no bearing or connotations of quality, since unofficial wallets are by nature more agile and can do more than core. 
As soon as this devolves into a marketing semantics war, you know you're not fighting against people who are technocratically interested: they just want to position their alts as "just as good" by bringing up these nitpicky pseudoarguments like they're worth even the time it takes to reply to them.

I mean, OK... but there is no statistical pattern to be found or divined from what happened in december. people made lots of assertions about tech, holidays, adoptions but it was not consistent with other patterns from other decembers, for example.
the biggest issue with any algo approach to stocks or valuation was proved with various crises in the past... nobody can really predict natural disasters or emergencies. which basically interrupt all patterning as an outlier or "new example."

But the chart shows bitcoin at 10k on 11-22-2017, it missed by 6 days. 
Feel free to tell me what btc is going to be in 12 days from now, and WHY you think that. What model / data are you using. Because this chart's model/data is clear yet you're offering "a guess" at a window that is 52x larger?


Wow, you really don't understand logarithmic regression. If you continue the chart, it's a regression showing the best fit line. It can be "off" by a large %. It was "off" in the opposite direction regarding going over 19k, for example. 
It cannot predict repression from natural disasters (exchanges going tits up under fraud/hacking).
You're making a claim about "an entire year." Ugh... just stop.
Here, let me approach this from a different direction: if you can explain to me what this chart is supposed to be showing, what the logic being used is, in one sentence, then you are correct and everything you're saying is valid.

Conversely, there is 100% chance that there will be a fiat currency.
When sovereign nations fold, and their currency folds with them (or without them), you could have invested in paintings or jewelry or, I dunno, other currencies that didn't fold. 
So the idea that "currencies fail" isn't really an issue that the wealthy worry about, which is why they are encouraged to diversify.
In other words, "your" fiat doesn't have to succeed as long as you have exit strategies to the fiat that will replace it.

Source? All I see is satoshi shooting down any attempts at blocksize increase which would have been trivial to implement back then, referring to "if needed."
They are not needed, so it is a value judgment regarding what "needed" means regarding acceptable fees. 
The only reason those fees are 


No, wrong. Disadvantage on short term valuation is not the same as "disadvantage towards centralization and compromised security."
So you mean to say "at this point bitcoin's value will take a hit if enough concern trolling about blocksize increase that only sways people who have no fucking concept of scalability issues get their way."
Zzz. b'cash proponents have already stated they'd move to L2 solutions because they know the blocksize nonsense is a silly centralization play that solves nothing in the long run and leads to centralization of nodes and, essentially, miner monopolization increasing. That's a funny narrative departure away from L2 = centralization, eh?
It's high-larious to me that people playing both sides of the fence to take advantage of people who aren't equipped to understand the differences here. 
@_date: 2019-07-23 08:41:50


This is irrelevant because the cost of transactions would be so ridiculously high and essentially slow that the number of transactions would never, ever increase that much.
The future of bitcoin's main blockchain is to have L2 on top of it. Always was. 
For example, when it costs $100 to send any amount of bitcoin, perhaps you wouldn't do that... but a system that is collating far more than $100 in bounties would. Or a few billion in transactions, etc.


No you can't.


There is no such thing as a "primary personal address" unless you decide to do that or use software that decides for you.


It doesn't have to explicitly mask this since you can do it yourself. So no, you cannot necessarily see any of this. The issue there is a good UX/UI for bitcoin which will come when the incentives to do so come, as everything else has. 
Anyone could write a bitcoin wallet that forces you to never be able to use the same addresses twice, for example, and mixes things to the point that any forensics leads to a fork of possibilities and not conclusive evidence.

If anything, if there was a legit ban on bitcoin, it's really just putting the shields up regarding anything westernized. Which may be unfortunate, but it also may be pretty fucking true.

No it isn't. Ugh. It's a bullshit fictitious number that is so easily manipulated with the trade volume + volatility we see today, never mind total supply, premining, and how distribution works.
It has almost nothing to do with supply because there is no possible estimate of how many coins actually exist or how many are 100% dead / inactive. 
If you think b'cash is actually 16% of bitcoin's market cap that's cute and hilarious. Do a poll on how many people will never, ever bother/trust to duplicate their btc holdings. Compare the volumes + volatility. 
These bullshit stats where every single shitskull altcoin that invents money out of thin air and declares all X,000,000,000 premined coins at $1 each is a fantasy where morons find other morons to prey on.

There are also people who think that way about their own favorites, or who have a small amount of diversified holdings, intentionally and not "HEY EVERYONE HAS b'cash LETS ALL AGREE IT HAS VALUE" pump and dump bullshit controlled by coinbase et al.
The people who see every single coin as a sort of freely exchanged crypto universe? Near 0. Sorry, there are way, way too many. Dogecoin is over $1B? LOL.
I mean, I just looked up a coin that literally has on its frontpage that it was built in the same city "near" other companies like Steam, Disney, Microsoft, Amazon. Wow! LOL fuckouttahere

Obviously less people who care "trusts" Libra over ... anything else (I trust dogecoin more than Libra, who cares).
The problem is the muscle behind Libra isn't exactly going to do nothing in terms of forming policy, lobbying, and swaying legislation in the jurisdictions it dominates.
You know how India is setting up to shit all over crypto? Well what about the sections of india who's entire internet are the zuckballoons piping facebook to them. Do you think they're going to "count that"? 
I know the sentiment on various reddit subs is that libra is good because it will virtue signal that "neutral coins" are the guiding light... but being the enemy of that power? 
All it takes is facebook to fuck over it's loyal bot spammers in those shitriver countries via threats of "if you touch other crypto you're outta Libraclub" and suddenly the adoption horizon looks so distant.

Huh? Of course it "works better" that way but it also requires the vendors to carry the volatility burden and risk. 
Custodial processors mitigate the risk by making the conversion to fiat. 
To put it another way, there's only a 1 month window where receiving bitcoin would have been a loss. However, can your business have 0 liquidity for the year it took to recoup? Not many can.
Saying "I'll give you $1 now but you'll have to wait a year while it climbs back up from $0.15 to actually get your dollar" isn't a great proposition.

We don't talk about arbitrage value of international currencies? OH OK SURE.
And the reason it's more popular to talk about the price of digital currency is due to the exchange value and lack of use outside of "I bought some at price X and sold it at price Y" There are many digital/cryptos that have no value, so those that do have value like to parade their values.

Not necessarily. It could also be that mining is cheaper than the value of bitcoin.
Also, with new supply cutting in half soon, that will clearly create enough wiggle room for profit. Even if it won't double (we might have already seen the doubling effect from, say, 4k to 8k) or decrease, the cost of mining &lt; the yield in bitcoin.
Though without subsidized electricity, rent and gear I've never seen a moment when mining was directly profitable over simply buying bitcoin for "cash out of pocket consumer w/no discount buying/renting gear and space." It completely depends on your mining costs.

Uh, what? Napster was shut down by court order, and then was liquidated after bankrupting. The legit music service was an attempt at capitalizing on the napster brandname and worked fine but was destroyed by other things in the market (both private torrent sites and legit streaming)
I worked on big budget decentralized music collection projects at the time (late 90s, early 00s)
The idea was simple: you bought a digital license and could play whatever songs you had limited rights to on any branded device (car radio, portable player, home player, website), and that was basically destroyed by the law stating that every single play was subject to a "broadcast fee," which would render any sort of system like that completely unfeasible and grossly expensive to the enduser. Literally overnight the projects were shuttered.
And then itunes came out a few months later... right when napster peaked (because now there was an explicit "hey each song costs $X, why would I do that when I could get this other app and get them for free?)...
So no, napster didn't self destruct. It was set on fire and capitalists used leverage to change laws and push their own "legit" products. 
Claiming P2P streaming "disapeared" in a few months is probably one of the most idiotic things I've read in a while... I don't know what to tell you but I'm not rehashing the last 17 years of technology to qualify the statement that it, uh, didn't....

bitcoin is the idea
bitcoin core is the software / wallet (and way back when, the miner)
to position bitcoin cash (an idea) against bitcoin core (the implementation) is a strategic mistake that discredits that effort to anyone in large scale dev and implementation circles.
The only people who buy into it are those who are waging a marketing war for greater fools.
those very same people "begrudgingly" hold a vast fortune in BTC. they were shunned and ostracised out of the adult table re:bitcoin and as a result point fingers and smear "collusion."

Great post over in personalfinance but I have a problem with their utilization of the term "received BCH."
Technically if you had a btc wallet with bitcoin pre-fork, you have that same amt in bch. And according to this that fork is a "taxable event." 
Huh? It's baffling to me how that could be possible since at the point of forking b'cash was worth $0. And I don't give a shit about whatever that value is now, it is still worth $0 to me. So if I had some amount of btc i'd have to pay tax on any shitcoin that someone invents as a fork? Even if I have zero access to it without doing work?
This sounds more and more like coinbase/bch is a centralizing honeypot. If you sent coin to coinbase from bitcoin with an identifiable amount from a few addresses, and "don't pay taxes" on the mirrored b'cash, "they" could easily know you had whatever amount of b'cash that went unreported.
What's the solution here? Destroying the b'cash? would you still need to pay treasure trove tax if you tossed it in a volcano? or non-destructively abandoned it?

fiat is exactly as inflationary as I think. 
maybe this was news to you and not anyone else.


You're omitting the part where work was modified to get the $1. As you stated above, the product yielded is "cheaper." Why is that? What impact does the cheaper product have on the baker / company when they work to get $1?
If previously I had to labor 8 hours a day to output the bread, and now I just flip a switch and watch the factory go which "makes bread cheaper" then what impact does it have on my labor and how much I "deserve to make for the work I do."
So, the portion you're missing is that it is easier to get that $1 for some, and very much harder to get that $1 for others. The factory owner sees a massive increase in profits, while the baker is fucked. 
And then people rail against fiat as though it's the problem, and not automation which misbalances earning with clear winners (owners) and losers (workers).
If anything, crypto is perpetual fairness, where the valuation of the currency is normalized to the cost it takes to generate it. Just ignore all of the early adopters who are poised to have the lion's share of it.

I'm saying if you remove the horseshit crypto (99.999% of it) then market dominance looks very different. The problem is who decides what "horseshit crypto" is? Spoiler alert: since 2013 can you name the number of cryptos that do not exist or have a valuation at all? go to bitcointalk.org and see all those "new bitcoin destroyers" that are literally nonexistent. Should we count all of those fake as fuck valuations, too, in the "crypto dominance chart?" Laff.
step 1: go here 
step 2: sort by market cap
step 3: i think AT LEAST 90 out of the top 100 of those coins are worthless bullshit
step 4: take the 10 (i'm being very generous here) remaining, TA DA, bitcoin has lost no "dominance" regarding cap.
step 5: market cap is a shitty stat. look at trade volume instead, on fee exchanges, TA DA, bitcoin's trade volume destroys 90 out of 100 of those which have near 0 volume.

You're confusing a whole buncha things here. Regarding cryo-freeze: the two main reasons to give a shit about the timing of this are blood and oxygen to the brain. What other "damage from the dying process" matters here?
Even if freezing a brain means you're never going to have neuronal firing again, the networks are what's preserved.
Since there are cases of people losing both to the brain and surviving without permanent damage more than "the moment after dying" there is plenty of evidence that a cryo methodology could at least be used to eventually snapshot a brain.
Obviously this is conjecture now, but in some number of years, who knows. Besides when you have hundreds of thousands of bitcoin like HAL the maintenance costs (assuming competency and no massive errors) are trivial.

While it is impossible to do another bitcoin, that has nothing to do with if some other coin is "worthy" or "better than" bitcoin functionality wise.
It's very much like MMORPGs in that regard. You'd think there's plenty of room for decent ones to start, but the playerbase is fatigued from the ones they've sunk a billion hours into of investment. So those old dinosaurs shamble on fueled by people with their sunk costs. 
Any attempt at something new fails because it's not as polished or streamlined as the previous ones, so that requires a TON of risk to even get off the ground. Not even a company like EA can pull that off anymore, with their relatively unlimited budgets.
The games themselves can't last. When MMORPGs were first around, there wasn't a robust internet full of spoilers and coordination out there. You couldn't just "get the answers" or "find the best way to complete it" so you were forced to experience the full effect.
Likewise with crypto. Bitcoin was very, very much a premine. Except it was a premine that only a select few from a very tightly knit, niche audience had access to (ignoring the developer team/gov/military/cloak and dagger theories) simply via obscurity. 
Now if you were to release "Bitcoin ++GOOD 2.0" or whatever, the only way to even attempt to emulate the launch of bitcoin is to willingly obscure it, which just makes you look like you're interested in raking in all of the cash yourself.
The irony here, is that someone already did that with bitcoin, yet conveniently since it's not being accessed anywhere it's out of sight, out of mind.
You try launching a 21million coin that the "creator" has ~600-700k of and see how well that goes. Yet since we have the OG holder with satoshi, all's good? Ehhhhh...

Because people think that anything that will be a viable threat to "the banks" and "sovereign money" will either be destroyed before it does too much damage, or will just be a replacement for the money they currently have when it is finally sanctioned. 
People like to puff out their chest and talk about how bitcoin can't be stopped but it would be trivially easy for it to be put squarely back in the realm of the black markets if your friendly local men with guns decide it.

The main issue is with the base layer internet not being private, it puts the responsibility of data collation on the endpoints instead of the user.
Many businesses don't even want this data, let alone to be responsible with it.
The USER should have an API and choose to open + close data and allow sharing.
This has an added benefit of allowing all of these external sites to talk with each other and "know" things without breaching privacy.
For example, it would be great if my bills, email, insurance, subscriptions, airplane tickets could all pull from my API and make data decisions and be aware of one another instead of requiring manual collation (which also requires each of those sites to secure and store the data).
This is where the internet is headed now, user APIs.
And so, that's the same thing that should happen with bitcoin. I should have wallets that can be attached to apps without those apps "owning the keys" so to speak. **Why can't I designate some portion of my coin to be "ready to go on an exchange" without that exchange needing KYC or holding the keys** That's a silly fuckin' mistake, and the only reason it is required is because it's fundamentally not how bitcoin privacy works.
So to address your concern, LN is a version of that, but it still requires a separate holding mechanism needlessly.

It's not merely ensuring blockchain is stuffed with high fees, it's spamming low fee blocks that your own mining mafia absorbs, which increases the average block cost.
segwit gets rid of the idea of static block sizes for block weights instead. 
this WOULD increase some of the blocks substantially, the benefit is that it would render the spam attacking idea useless as the blocks would scale up for them and not "disinclude" lower TX. It basically kills any incentive for high tx fee = priority because it can scale.
the problem with this is that mining = the money, and that power is quite, quite powerful. 
suppressing blocks to squeak out profit is a sort of meta game that early adopters can easily play. 0.01 bitcoin to them isn't $150, because they obtained it when it was pennies or even cheaper. 
So losing 1 or 2 btc to drive the rewards up tens of thousands of "real dollars" is great. 
The thing to keep in mind is that you need to remember to throw the whole libertarian anti-bank, anti-decentralization concepts out the window because these mining mafias need FIAT to operate or have an outlet (ahem, exchanges, ahem, shitminer rigs) that makes it profitable for them immediately.
These people are running fiat businesses and playing with the hype and rhetoric "blah blah centralization blah blah scalability." They are all 100% interested in $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ profits first, not crypto.

1/2 of all bitcoin that will ever be in existence was mined at a pricepoint of &lt;$50, if you want to be nitpicky &lt;$15 (but costs had already skyrocketed which is why price exploded after first halvening).
The part that these "lines on a chart" ignores is that the price of bitcoin could be based on a speculation of the value 6 halvings from now.
To put it into context, the earliest miners were mining 50 bitcoin multiple times a day, then daily, then weekly, and so on.
The % increase simply from those early years of mining could cover plenty of "doublings" until breaking even.
This "cost to mine 1 btc is doubled" is, essentially, a vapid datapoint.

any legally operating exchange has your ID and could ostensibly provide tax documents. When your "--orb" account on the exchange has your real info attached to it, they know all events that happened on that account and attribute it to you.
When you move coins around and shuffle them, whatever, there isn't a tax event until you convert to fiat currently. If you do that in person there is no way "to know" just like cash under the table at a place of employment. However if you have $X and you obscure that by only depositing random small amounts into your bank account to specifically avoid notice, that's illegal under structuring laws.
But if you do the fiat conversion via an exchange, again the account you use is tied to some KYC AML identification of you IRL.
So yes, the idea is that your wallet on an exchange and at any place where you exchange crypto for fiat or other crypto IS tied to your RL identity.
It's like asking how the government knows when you post a threat on a messageboard that it was you... they have your IP address, and can subpoena the records that ties that IP to your RL records.

Satoshi essentially said, as you've quoted: "here's how you'd implement it IF WE NEED IT."
The whitepaper says:


avoid   mediating   disputes.     The   cost   of   mediation   increases   transaction   costs,   limiting   the
minimum practical transaction size and **cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions**
Now you don't put something negative like that in your whitepaper then turn around and do nothing when your coin project basically does exactly that, yea?

Bear in mind that people have tens of thousands of bitcoin obtained at near 0 valuation to "play" with. that level of market manipulation is, literally, infinite. 
at this point, i'd love to see a chart that breaks down what every valuation of every bitcoin is. 50% of them were obtained when it was &gt;0.10, for example.
So given that, how valuable is storing value in a token, just in general. even if the valuation was rock solid and never increased again? that's a large part of driving the valuation. people want it and enough people "value" it all the way up to where it is that it will unlikely lose that value.
the threat is that 50% "attack" from people who value it at $0, who don't mind selling it all the way down to $0 if they were "getting out." But something tells me that someone who's held that much for that long isn't interested / doesn't need to devalue it or really even control it.

it's the difference between DEFLATIONARY and INFLATIONARY money. One of them, your money is worth LESS tomorrow, so you best spend it today. The other one, your money is worth MORE tomorrow, so why spend it?
What you are investing in is a lack of reliance on a 3rd party to exchange value with other people. Unfortunately, between paypal, zelle, quickpay systems, visa/mastercard/other credit card systems, square, whatever... people are used to having that 3rd party to exchange value. 
And that 3rd party, eventually, becomes the authority of money in exchange for the ability to profit from doing risky things with your money and offering a cut of their profits + basic security.
Otherwise, even with the volatility of the valuation, nobody can touch your crypto once it has "value." No bank can freeze it, nobody can show up in your safe deposit box and replace fiat with "iou slips," nobody can stop your money from crossing "political borders." More edgy yet: nobody can prevent you from donating to an agitating force.
To put it another way, you don't have to search hard to see a bank saying "we're not allowing you to give money to or accept money from entities that trade bitcoin for xyz reasons."
No review, no due process. Just civil forfeiture and guilty until you convince us otherwise
that's why this pissing match between people about the small scale use of bitcoin is boorish and ultimately only regarding centralizing power and short-term profit. I don't pay for my cup of coffee with war bonds, I also don't make assumptions about "what crypto is REALLY SUPPOSED TO BE" when it is literally 5 years old and I've seen a dozen explanations of what it is that were ultimately clearly debunked later and no longer arguments. 
The reference to a vague, poorly worded, thesis statement as a holy scripture is just more evidence of the short-term gain of power and centralization being at play. It'd be like entrusting the public to make decisions about which nuclear reactor design is "truly superior" ...

that said, any fork with enough consensus would be equivalent of replacing bitcoin, as far as valuation is concerned, of course. but not the technological ideal "bitcoin" ... there's no way. it's like saying a ferrari could have square tires. if it moves away from the ideal of being a speedy car, it won't.

the libertarian stance is that if I want better roads, public service, whatever, I'll opt-in to pay for it rather than be coerced to pay for it by men with guns and have basically 0 control over how it is used.
Also, the way the system in the US works is that even if you disagree with the system you're "required" to pay for it. You cannot protest the system by withholding the funding of it.
Imagine deciding that your government is a rogue entity that is not representing you and instead suckling the balls of the rich (totally making this up), and that you are required BY LAW to support the government via doing it. That makes zero sense.
The problem with this stance, and why libertarians basically die on the vine, is that they're assuming this level of selfishness is "the most fair" while they're ignoring that people have been systematically oppressed and part of the role of government is striking that balance. In short, their stance is "fuck them, let them die off so we can finally get to where things are fair."
The only thing these anti-social tards have in common with filthy liberals is their disdain for the rich *who bend government to their will.* In their view, if you became rich by good ol' bootstrap pulling that's allll right. Never mind the legacy of advantages passed down generationally. We seem to handwave the whole "king/emperor/pharoah/holy leader taking your money" origin of taxation away.
For all the ways that taxes are used for good, there are dozens of ways that you would never support your taxes being used.
It's like saying "hey you pay 'taxes in general' because they save the dying babies and that's a good thing!" while ignoring that somehow those same taxes go to fucking the babies up in the first place...

Every monetary system is a "system of percentage gains." That's a meaningless term. Can you increase or decrease by a %? Every molecule in the universe can do that.
You're separating "the money you make at work" from "the money you use while investing" as a separate system.
It's all the same fucking system. 
I can go to a micronesian village and gamble my $ while predicting which way the dead chicken's head will point when it bleeds out, that's also the same system. I will "gain or lose" a percentage of my $, etc.
In fact, you could set the linear gains of income at 1 and base everything in the world off of that, where you have some - or + % based on that 1. So when I make 1, 1, 1, 1 and you make 2, 2, 2, 2 you could simply recalculate that as +100% over baseline.

uh, yeah, obviously we're still in "price discovery" mode and will be until certain use-cases are resolved and certain regulations that would have big impact play out.
You're comparing the 1913 USDollar for some reason (i'm assuming the ease of math) and not the fact that to get to that level of stability there were HUNDREDS of years of iteration.
Never mind all of the problems with "general store notes" and such that lead to a centralized currency in the first place. You might have some IOU or value store that was, whoops, deemed useless.
So yeah, I'd say your analogy is bullshit simply because bitcoin is still in discovery phase.
1. you refer to 2008, when bitcoin started in 2009.
2. the valuation wasn't "1 cent" or "less than a penny" it was literally 0. FOR OVER A YEAR AND A HALF. It wasn't until late 2010 that the value started solidifying.
3. bitcoin does have stability as far as vendors are concerned because they get instant conversion to fiat. a user of bitcoin has no incentive (besides revolution or something silly) to go fiat-&gt;btc-&gt;3rd party-&gt;vendor just to use it. It's more expensive due to transactions and more of a hassle. than fiat-&gt;vendor.
So, currency shmurrency... bitcoin's value is completely spurred by speculation as to how it could be used or adopted. companies adopting it for use are merely demonstrations of the potential. the early adopters have 100% of the leverage to sell off, make a profit and pursue the next iterations of it.

horrible analogy.
Yes, that's true if you don't value your time and consider your opportunity cost to be $0. (foolish)
You do realize that in the TIME it took you to borrow the hardware and mine, you could have been using to do something else and realize profits.
Equating value you could have actualized and lost because of thievery is not at all the same as value you didn't actualize, could have, and didn't because of external forces on a market.
In other words, those thieves don't get upset because the .5 bitcoin they stole is now worth .25, simply because that opportunity cost is identical and the yield is different.
Nobody cost you a lot of money except yourself if you buy high and sell low. You don't seem very well informed... do you not think as tax season comes to an end people aren't going to cash out?

Realize that the actual "time stamp pulse" of these exchanges are hilariously awful. The real stock market runs at an iteration much, much faster. Even a 10 second lag could mean the difference between billions of dollars of gain or loss... but this is "Acceptable" on these exchanges because the volatility covers it.

@_date: 2017-12-02 02:32:44
And thus perpetuating that it is a pyramid scheme where you're just near the tip of the pyramid. 
If you got in at $1,000, you've already seen gains of 11x your investment. Someone buying bitcoin at $11,000 would have to wait for it to get to $121,000 to get to that same point. And someone buying it at $121k has to then wait for it to be at $1.331 million. Now consider that someone who had 10,000 bitcoins when it was at $0.01 has seen that 11x increase 5.8 times already. Think of how much market control that person has. For reference, buying 100 btc for a total of $1 investment is now worth &gt;$1,000,000. 
That $1,000 investment needs to hit $1,096,674,067 to realize that amount of exponential gain. In short, bitcoin will never be as profitable to someone at "only" 1,000... now imagine how much volume those earliest investors had access to... It's less a pyramid and more an obelisk.
And I don't mean that in a negative way: all currency is basically a pyramid scheme. But I don't think it's that much fodder for imagination when you consider **hodlers since 0.01 have already multiplied their investment so much that a purchaser at $1,000 has to wait for it to go into the billions** to realize. 
We saw this same greater fool theory in action with introductory ASICs. There was never a point where spending the $$$ on an ASIC was better than spending that same $$$ to just buy bitcoin. That should be enough to end this "inclusion" myth and put it squarely in the realms of "greater fool required."
Let that sink in a bit: 1/2 (~8.3 million) of the bitcoin that exists today was gotten by 8/16/2012, and had a whopping $15 valuation for 1.

Worst case scenario there is that the ultrarich enjoy the uprisings so they can put all that power of theirs to use. A little fear is also a good thing for them so that they start their off-planet endeavors and leave this shithole behind.


This is your mistake. 
Think of humankind as 1 organism. All the shittiness that you're talking about is the system's doing. And the system gobbles up the planet and squirts out a handful of smart / rich people as the "winners" of the system, and they go to other planets and repeat the process.
These people that you're complaining about are weathered winners from many, many iterations of people. Sure, some blips here and there, rags to riches, new money, etc. But there's a reason that the "bloodlines of the illuminati" is a thing people mythologize, it's those people who've maintained their win streak.... and it is essentially part of their DNA to recognize the sacrifice that had to have happened at some point in their past to gain that power: being a patri- or matriarch of a family that you don't really care about or have time for. 
That power is the power to shape countries. Rothschild banking has dictated wars everywhere there wasn't a central bank in their name, yet we see governments moving to come up with Very Good Reasons otherwise.
And here we have a depiction of that sort of power. The weak hands capitulating to the strong. You can resist it, but it will always seem small. And maybe in a few generations that simple act of restraint makes your minor gesture a relatively strong hand.
Plenty of people have seen that, in only 10 years. When all advice was to diversify, cut risks, so on and so forth, etc. From nothing to something. From something to something more.
The pattern is clear, you will likely never join them off-planet. They resist anything that allows anyone to catch up (stopping the enviornment from swallowing us whole, stopping access to equality via internet and education), but you could very subtly resist. And enough resistance forces them to include us. 
Past that, they need people to do the shit jobs until they figure out how to automate them (janitor at the space station).

The roadmap was always layer2 transactions, as far as I could remember 7 years ago.
"Losing" to an inferior technology because it's more exploitable, vulnerable and centralized leading to manipulation on exchanges + by miners, that has easily 4 or 5 tiers of greater fools all in a line to suck each other off? Who gives a fuck?
As you said, it could go down to $100 (it won't, so what's actually realistic) and then in 5 years some layer2 tech comes out and wow, we have a winner and a lot of cheap BTC available, apparently.
The logic behind big block is the same logic that allows idiots to look at this and not immediately roll their eyes so fucking hard they fall out of their head and type shitposts 
Big blocks lead to more centralized networks. It is simple, and proven. BTC is simply being dust spammed and we've seen the proof that some of the miners are gobbling up their own jizz and basically taking a tiny hit to essentially exacerbate the chain.
There is NOTHING that can rapidly fix this, what WILL fix it is:
1. widespread, reference, segwit
2. 2nd layer protocols
Now, look at that graph and realize that the bitchcash "logic" is 3rd party reliance like lightning network is "centralizing." HAHAHA, yeah, OK.

Like "all things" that have value, actually. Even things that have purportedly intrinsic value, that's a subjective measurement dictated by a marketplace.
Blockchain and crypto's inherent value is a public, non-3rd party required, store of wealth. There is no other instrument that resists seizure or interruption with the same resilience of properly guarded crypto.
All of the hype and investment potential / speculation aside, even if bitcoin tanked it's a way to directly pay people, digitally and remove 3rd parties (**as well as the protections / entrapments they offer**) from the equation.
Problem is people are so accustomed to paying for things indirectly, digitally: customer -&gt; payment system -&gt; recipient that the convenience, protection and convenience of, say, visa, paypal, venmo or your bank's system are considered good enough by the vast majority of people.

People with concern trolls, blaming a variety of factors, are ignoring that even at this lowered valuation the volume is still approaching the same level where the peak valuation occurred.
This is a good thing, and indicative of confidence actually increasing (especially when you consider volume at a lower valuation requiring more individual exchanges.)
For everyone thinking in terms of fiat to assess their trade when selling or "losing potential gains", there is someone thinking in longer terms and considering that at some point later down the line this is a good purchase that is either profitable valuewise or for greater philosophical gain.
It amazes me that this sub can be so incorrect about simple confidence assessment, where all  I see are people quite willing to buy the discounted coin -- and more of it -- for future prospects.
To put it another way, if volume went up 2x as the valuation dropped 2x, flatlining, that has absolutely 0 to do with confidence as on average that implies 0 change in confidence.
I would be more concerned if the value stayed high, or where it is, and 0 people traded it. Especially now at the end of the season.

you're omitting a key fact: the sustained dust attack by "big blockers" on the blockchain filling up the blocks.
when you have thousands of bitcoins and investment in other crypto this attack is a costeffective way (transaction costs are near 0 if your bitcoins were gained at near 0 valuation) of pumping the value of other chains.
increasing the blocksize only encourages and sustains these attacks. 
notice the narrative shift towards "bitcoin devs are corrupt and want to push off-chain solutions like lightning, when on chain 'should scale forever.'"
Not even a year ago the narrative was "bigger blocks act as an acceptable bandaid until offchain solutions fix things."
THIS flipflop is why there is near 0 faith in the intentions of these big blockers. 
It is a slippery slope that only the deepest pockets benefit from.
People seem to forget how much btc out there was gained and held at &lt;$30 each. That makes those transactions costs negigible in the eyes of someone who gains so much by positioning other coins or selling theirs.
The hodl til moon gainz meme is pervasive here but realize how many already have a self driving flying car on mars before asserting we're even in similar boats regarding some 4% gain with $50 fees are the "common user scenario."

Manipulation? Huh?
There is no benefit to having multiple anonymous accounts on an exchange for manipulation purposes, only for "obscuring your wealth" and ONLY when you are using fraudulent credentials, which is what they're "officially criminalizing."
Coinbase only allows a certain number of linked bank accounts. So if you want to structure effectively you need multiple coinbase accounts and it's safe to assume that you need to obscure your identity to pull that off.
This legislation would in fact LEGITIMIZE exchanges and has 0 to do with manipulation.
You clearly haven't used them and have no first hand experience with them to make these idiotic claims

Yes, of course it does.
Think of some "we buy your bitcoin" bullshit like cash app or coinbase.
They can get your bitcoin and give you fiat but then say "after analysis your coins were tainted so fuck you" and freeze accounts basically permanently.
So, I mean, the onus is always on you. You could have 10-fold removed 'dirty coins' and at some point some entity says "we'll never accept those coins" so that essentially devalues them, where all you can do is pass the buck to someone else.
But yes, forensically entities can say "we never want any coin that has even a many-hop-removed amount of taint." and you're screwed if you ever want to use them there.

This is woefully incorrect because of the concept of "fair value" which is mentioned repeatedly throughout the FINCEN guidelines.
You can't say "HA HA but I didn't trade X **DOLLARS**... I traded in some object instead" because those objects would have a fair value. Cars, houses, gold, whatever.
Mining itself -- the actual generation -- is a taxable event based on the fair value in $$$$ of the coins when mined.

bitcoin worked just the same when it had a fraction of the volume and wasn't under attack by the shitcoiners you're giving shoutouts to. it's sad because it's painfully obvious that you're either at the tip of that pyramid or you're scurrying around trying to find any value at all. baghodlers indeed
they want to slow bitcoin down as much as possible but believe me they're sitting pretty on their thousands of btc and can do all sorts of shenanigans from bullshit mining rigs to bullshit coins to essentially further pump things.
the worst case scenario for btc here is that the problem happens and is then solved. there is a mighty healthy cottage industry around non-bitcoin blockchain, and any solution such as lightning network applies to ALL of those (like the aus stock exchange).

I do not, I'm just saying we're in an adoption phase where the libertarian island hopping tax evasion is not the "new wave."
The more cloak + dagger you portray this, the more people are going to flee to "banks running exchanges" with open arms. you say "the horror stories are for real" but I'm pretty sure anything major would have surfaced publicly by now, right?

Bitcoin, like most of the internet, was not developed by or for millennials.

Look, look at the high school millionaire on TV stumbling through basic questions about it!

except that's not how that works at all.
Less ignorant customer buys an amount of bitcoin they think they need + enough to cover a decent fee.

By the time it does go through, the amount they guaranteed is not "locked in" anymore and they have to send more. Including another fee.

what if they mined it when valuation was $0. current law in US is that amount would be reported as income and taxed as $0
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:29:41
I'll play devil's advocate if you'd like, and clear up those dumb examples.
Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme where 50% of the total bitcoin in existence were mined while at $0 valuation.
As soon as exchange were made, and people assigned value, exchanges and whales could easily, ridiculously, manipulate the market (some argue they still do while hiding behind 'sorry bad programming lol').
The problem with the "market cap" numbers is that they don't cascade. We see a valuation of $11,000 per 1 btc, but if you actually started selling any serious amount of volume, that valuation would go into the toilet until "refreshed" by the pump + dumpers who are making "divide by zero" amounts of profit since they mined tens of thousands before there was any valuation at all. 
Besides that, the valuation makes bitcoin itself extremely vulnerable to takeover if you consider that a conglomerate of banks can simply buy every sell order that's out there themselves which will in turn increase the valuation due to scarcity.
for example, say the only sell orders are for 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15k. For 6 purchases, I can essentially set the valuation at 15k. This gets the rabble roused here on the forums and gets media attention (wowow BTC gains 5k in like 10 minutes omg it's awesome!) but the volatility is what gets it there. 
In short, that volatility--even in an early adoption price discovery phase--proves a sort of vulnerability at worst and a "new banker overlord" at best where early adopters are basically just at the tip of the pyramid acting as a bank to the marketplace, selling and buying at ridiculous volumes if they'd like and more or less fixing the prices.
In other words, that volatility is a marker that someone with, say, more volume in their hands than coinbase transacts in a month, is in far more control than anyone would care to admit because they're allowed in on the sick gains scheme for the meantime.
Some of the early services + markets (casinos, selling, etc) obtained more bitcoins in a few weeks than the volume of bitcoin that has been transferred in the last year.
I am close friends with a CFO at a major money firm, and "curiosity about the phenomenon" really starts and stops with "how the fuck do you regulate this."
They will not spend any resources analyzing this -- it isn't really that difficult to, it's that the volume is so low and the market is so easily manipulated -- until they know that they're not going to be directly linked to whatever schemes the govs of the world decide profit the most (illegally) from it.
Finally, look at the stops in place: If you try to cash out in a big way, you get fedgov flagged and they will be up your ass with a microscope either as a threat to suppress any sort of reciprocation (aka, bitcoin is worthless if you can't convert it from the token to cash reasonably sanely) or, if you, say, only cash out enough to emulate a monthly paycheck they can not only claim you are just doing that to smurf / structure to explicitly avoid the flag but then also seize the account as the residue of this guilty before investigation process.
That's the problem with the hodl mentality: you can avoid 100% of the gov (libertarian, "the point is freedom" argument) by never actually using bitcoin. uh, hmm, so what's the point again? It's "using" it which is really some sort of rube goldberg levels of obscuring the fact that whatever goods you're purchasing with BTC are backed by fiat.
It's like only supporting someplace like a vegan grocery store when in the end they pay rent out to the same developers that destroy baby owls for oil pipelines or whatever. I guess you're one step removed from "the system" but pretending that you're thwarting it as you daytrade for sick gains with a guy fawkes mask on is again, silly.
"Just wait until everyone can use it!" Yes, that's also the perfect time for a government regulation to drop a hammer at the behest of the institutions that support the entire capitalist structure in the entire world. 
Just because you're facing the ground doesn't mean the guillotine is not above you.
Anyhoo - I'd love to hear how any of this isn't logically sound. Zero of what I'm typing is of a position of "not supporting the scam" or how there is an intrinsic nature towards btc valuation... it's just as simple as "there are too many unknowns."

It IS that simple: 
if you mined 10,000+ bitcoin at $0 in 2010, selling lots of bitcoin is never a loss. Selling only to rebuy it is also not a loss, because you end up with more bitcoin than you started with.
The value of your HOLDINGS is less, of course... but then it takes less holdings to make the valuation back up when bitcoin creeps back up

Oh, there is one proposed already? Great. Problem solved. What's your point?
This is just spurring along solutions to fixing the issue. Big blockers claim a bigger block is better and would fix it immediately, but that doesn't solve the central problem that a layer2 fix does.
"Need more miner decentralization" ... you're free to start a pool or mine solo, or point your lazers at an underdog pool.
Finally, please tell me how you'd ever stop this sort of transaction from happening? Even with bigger blocks or 10x the volume you could always spam transactions at some threshold to profit from it as people increase their transaction fee to get priority.

I dunno about that. You're glossing over the answer to the question "Why not start your own tokenized system in a gov run, with closed mining, network?"

"Selling points?" maybe by some % of the neckbeard libertarians with their fantasies of "sending money to a village in micronesia for free" or something, a completely idiotic point that nobody ever gave a fuck about.
Anyone who was aware of how bitcoin worked saw all of this coming and knew that the bounties on blocks would inflate alongside the value of bitcoin.
There is no scenario where a block is worth &gt;$100,000 that a transaction is free. That would be scaling up everything EXCEPT mining, which is not possible. The mining hashrate increases thus making it more expensive to get the same % of a block, thus requiring more bounty out of mining to make it worthwhile. 
Layer 2 technologies are already implemented which demonstrate "cheap/fast" transactions, and remember this post because people will still bitch about something to get their miner-favored bigger blocks. They've resorted to flat out lying about the histories to confuse people, so who knows.

That's like saying any open source software is centralized amongst the open source developers. You're trying to make the point that "most" development work happened by a singular entity.
You can make easier centralization claims like: 50% of the coins in existence were owned in 2012 by less than 1% of the current userbase. 
That's the definition of centralized, but people are too busy establishing their place in the valuation pyramid than worrying about the tip of it.
If satoshi and the next 3 largest holders showed up tomorrow and sold 100% of their btc to a single entity would that make bitcoin more centralized?

volume is (value*numbertraded).
10,000 trades at $1 is the same volume as 10,000,000,000 trades at 0.000001$.
The difference is that more trades to reach the same volume is a more accurate representation of valuation as it implies a higher percentage of the market are "declaring their assessment of value."
Valuation goes up and down when there is a mismatch of people willing to buy and people willing to sell. Volume stagnates when nobody is willing to sell or buy at the current value.
Thus, lack of volume is the only indicator of "valuation confidence." NOT what the valuation currently is. It could sit at $20k forever and never be traded again. That means there is 0 confidence that it's actually worth anything between $20k and $0. 
To put it another less binary way, some tiny amount of people were willing to buy at the ATH. The rest were only willing to buy under it.
Crude analogy: if 1 person is willing to pay $10,000 for the shit out of my ass, but 100,000,000,000 people are willing to pay $0... just because I was able to sell to that one person doesn't mean the valuation is $10,000. I can dance around and shitpost (literally), and get shills to back me, and spend $9,999.99 on marketing to prove how valuable my shit is, but that's a classic pump and dump penny-stock scheme. If I can juuuuuuuuust get that valuation up to $0.01, that's $1,000,000,000.
The early adopters of various coins--b'cash and bitcoin included-- know that they could walk away with that $10,000 but they're also so wealthy that they can risk all $10k AND MORE to just get that valuation to uptick a little bit.

You're describing this mythical idea that people swooped in and "bought large bitcoin positions."
The true whales mined early or mined big. That's it.
This "lambo meme" crowd are largely irrelevant, because in that case the people you have to worry about are the ones where they could put on their eyes wide shut masks and get their fellow owl-dildo-god worshiping brethren to literally buy 100% of bitcoins that are for sale. The market cap has nothing to do with what's actually fluid and making it to the exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:03:05
that's called structuring, and is illegal.
this is (stupidly) aimed at actually making BTC day-to-day spending less obnoxious. IE, you buy 100 positions of bitcoin at $1, $2, $3... all the way to $100. Then every time you use that btc to buy coffee, you pay some different "gain" on the realized tax event. Silly/difficult to keep track of every purchase and calculate the "proper" taxes right?
The real answer is don't tax any individual transaction and simply tax the aggregate gains. 
I honestly don't see the problem: you do the same thing with buying and selling small quantities of stock. The problem is not 'everyone in the world' does this to purchase some coffee. If they did it would be equally obnoxious to report as BTC currently is.

Without reading the article: it was never a good investment over just buying bitcoin directly UNLESS you could lower electricity/supply/space costs under what a typical citizen could attain.


for argument's sake, let's say total TH/s is 67,000,000. You're adding 53 TH/s with this antminer.
That's 53/67,000,053 of total BTC gain going to you or 0.00000079104415
144\*12.5=blocks per day\*11,800=21,240,000$ mined every day. 
Your cut would be $16.80 every day, not $600/mo. ($511).
You're claiming electricity is $221/mo which is basically $7.25 a day.
$9.55 a day generated. 
Your startup cost was $1600, so that would take 167 days to recoup the cost of just buying the mining rig.
5 and a half months is a long time to assume electricity costs stay constant, hashrate doesn't grow, and bitcoin price stays where it is.
Let's assume that hashrate increases the same as it did in the last 5.5 months: from 41,000,000 to 67,000,000 = 1.6x so now it's 107,000,000
53/107,000,000. now your cut is 0.000000495327103, generating $2/day by the end. So every day you're making less money as the hashrate increases, from $9.55 -&gt; $2 in 5.5 months.
Assuming a linear decrease in profits, that's where you'll see that you'll never quite reach the point where the rig's costs were profitable over just spending $1600 plus $221/month on bitcoin directly. 
If it was, then wouldn't the people making the mining rigs just... use them instead of sell them? They're already at a markup over cost, so they don't pay $1600 each unit.
Anyway, the price would literally have to go up over 4x from here for that to be the case. And it has done this before. But simple math shows that the "typical, non sweetheart deal" for mining would have been better spent on just buying bitcoin directly. But free / on credit / leased hardware/space/maintenance/electricity changes that.

I dunno, but don't you find it pretty ridiculous to state this out loud? You are essentially saying "I don't have $2500 that I can afford to risk in bitcoin." You are also maybe implying that "I didn't get in early enough that more than .25 bitcoin was cheap and affordable."

Maybe you should reread what I'm saying, since you're having trouble comprehending it: I'm saying that the valuation of coinbase IS MINISCULE and DOES NOT REPRESENT THE ENTIRE LIQUIDITY OF THE BTC MARKET, as you can clear out the sell book with $150M.
Yet everyone gets a hardon when the price on coinbase nears 20k while other exchanges sit tight at 15.5k
Nothing you've said counters anything I've said, and you're so ignorant you can't even see how you are corroborating my point.
The fucking valuation of a bitcoin is not what the database number at 1 exchange is. Because, again, it takes maybe $150-200million to drop that special number to less than 50% of what it is right now.
I made no assertion about "entire liquidity of BTC market," I directly refer to the valuation at any given exchange.
But again, you clearly have had 0 practice with this. So who's the one not worth the time? Go somewhere else and be wrong about DragonMint some more
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:13:30
You don't know what market manipulation is if you think it's "selling lots just to rebuy when it's cheaper."
The bottomline is that there isn't much volume up on exchanges.
There are ~16 million bitcoins that have been created since genesis.
You can buy a whopping 16.63k bitcoins for $121 million to wipe out all of GDAX sell book down to $1k. 
That's 0.1% of the bitcoin. Think of that "valuation" shittiness. Everyone is so fixated on "market cap" when that takes all 16 million bitcoin and states it is 16M * CURRENT_VALUE rather than the idea that you can make all bitcoin worth $1k just buy buying 0.1% of it? 
That's hilariously awful.

It does, because low/no fee is only happening due to a sustained attack that is not fixed by onchain scaling. If the flunkies at bcash would turn off their attack, you'd see the result. Think of it this way: major pool spams with dust, mines some high % of blocks to recoup costs of the spam, inflates bounties by forcing higher average transaction fee, repeat.
So, you can bandaid this with a bigger block which just allows them to spam harder to fill it - and only benefits a portion of the userbase - or you can wait until the fix is developed.
You're also whining about transaction fees but you can put a tiny fee in and eventually get through. so "low/no fee" isn't the problem, it's the amount of time it would take to get confirmed with a "low/no fee."
Just remember these bullshit posts when this isn't a problem anymore. I don't care if it happens when bitcoin is $1 after a crash because of how bad it is, or if bcash becomes the "main chain" (lol i'll never support a chain that resorts to the dirty tricks that have been pulled here).

Before this circle jerk happens on the corpse of banks, it keeps him up at night because
1. cryptocurrency is a misnomer. it's not currency because it must act as reliable store of value and you can spend it easily. it doesn't, so it is not money.
2. crypto = securities.
3. you're buying risk, which makes it gambling moreso than investing. "You should read the fine print." The BOC doesn't regulate these instruments/markets just like they don't regulate trad securities.
4. What does the arrival of crypto mean for the cash in your pocket? The only truly riskfree use of cash is central bank issued. Checks/debit cards/etc, use intermediaries. If a cyber attack was to hit the financial system, wouldn't you want to have cash?
5. Central bank might issue its OWN digital currency. All banks are considering this.

I don't care if anything changes, economies are formed by those following the herd and using poor rationalizations and those who see through the bullshit to form more accurate valuations + capitalize on them.
The central point is there is a massive difference between a market cap and trade volume that fluctuates maybe 1% in a few months, and one that fluctuates 50% in a month with volumes spiking whenever someone has a "big order" come through.
So the comparisons -- even internally -- are irrelevant. Like, the trade volume today vs the market cap 13 months ago would be remarkable if the volume wasn't basically the same. It's a meaningless bit of trivia.
In other words, we're comparing bitcoin with other entities where you CANNOT wipe out entire trade books with trivial investment.

Like-kind has always been foggy. Certain things you would assume are like-kind are too dissimilar to be considered, other things have never had precedent set via challenges.
Securities themselves have never been eligible for like-kind.
I don't think it defines current trades in any way except "uh we have no way of proving or disproving you did anything because we didn't require exchanges to track them." Of course, more established places store everything they possibly can for analysis reasons. Less established places - or places that don't exist anymore - can't provide those.
It's like in the pre-internet era, you could say you graduated from a highschool that burned down that you could have reasonably attended. You could likewise say "I got my 1 bitcoin by starting with 0.1 from a faucet that no longer exists and trading back and forth on an exchange that no longer exists between crypto that no longer exists to end up with 1 bitcoin."
The idea is that post jan1 it would be less likely or impossible to do that, or at least put the burden on you to have been paying taxes when you traded btc to kanyecoin to novacoin and back.
You will no longer be able to hide in that obscurity to the same degree, as the burden is on you to have been reporting tax events all the way up.

You refer to your "been here since, duh-hyuck" like it actually proves some sort of relevance or wizened, olde experience. Show me your bitcointalk or web of trust timestamps and then people might give a fuck (probably not).
Everything you're talking about was always here, always a part of the discussion. You used BTC to pay $40,000 for Sims2, woah, you're cool.
These scalability debates have been talked about for literally 7 years, when the FIRST dust attacks were happening to clog the mempool. 
That sort of action is GOOD, because it creates a marketplace and impetus to solve the problem decisively. Do you realize how much power the first entity will have that reliably solves this issue? THAT is one of the btc arguments, it's probably too much power. But, you know, people didn't seem to have too much issue with newegg/steam using bitpay to pay for shit. Funny that.
So yes, with that power comes the incentive to solve it and last in the space. And garsh, all it will take is people to actually adhere to the fucking technology (looking at you, core segwit bullshitters) for it to happen. Yee haw.
I mean, you lose almost all credibility by saying "you believe in Bitcoin technology." You mean blockchain, yea? And you realize that you can customize the blockchain to work subtly differently to have far-reaching implications? So, yes, tell us why you think bitcoin's implementation is "the best" versus any number of minor tweaks?
The % of fat to meat in this forum has not changed, just the volume. A bunch of memelord shitposters who "sorta kinda" want to burn banks to the ground or something is nothing new... but don't pretend that the informed debate lives and dies (oh god that's laughable) here. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:59:06
Huh? Volume dictates confidence.
Nobody can concern troll volume numbers into existence. Even at lowered valuations the volume of trades are still near peak. Even though crypto has lost a ton of value, it has maintaned high volume.
This is called "price discovery."
When you have 10,000,000 individual trades and the valuation doesn't change: that's stability. 
When you have 1000 trades and the valuation goes up 200% and then down 190%, that's volatility.
No fuckin idea what your point is about saying "there's a bias towards nothing being wrong." 
What? I would love to cause a sell off panic and obtain cheaper coins while establishing volume. I wish the volume would go up 10,000,000,000x and cause the valuation to go to $100 if it meant bitcoin (or any crypto) had a solid price and could be used as a steady, predictable store of value.
All these random spikes and peaks are horseshit and cause far more damage via people thinking "this volatility is too much risk" than if it was cheaper but higher volume.
So, I don't give a shit about someone saying "nothing is wrong" or "everything is wrong:" I can tell you what I'd like to see out of any given crypto and just assume the valuation will follow a sustained era of transactions that don't swing the price wildly for "meme reasons."
With any stock, if the price goes to the moon there is a REASON behind that hype. Following any spike, if that volume doesn't sustain, it slowly dwindles and discovers towards the reality of what people are willing to pay for entry supporting that entity.
Some entity gaining a few percent reliably - or even just staying at 0% - is far superior to something that follows up a mega climb with a mega drop and any amount of volume swings valuation wildly.
My personal goal or desire is to know that in X months bitcoin will be worth Y, within a reasonable margin of error. Without that, volume is stifled and utility (as a currency or not) is minimized.

 SPREADING THIS FUD
I've seen this cross posted **4 times** in the last 3 days now, and it is all based on the same misinterpretation.
This is literally a copy pasta from this blog post:  I don't think EaFaer = Landon Mutch, and I don't get why THIS POST got all the traction when I've seen it over and over again.
"“criminalize [those] intentionally concealing ownership or control of a [digital currency or digital exchange] account.” Wow. Let this sink in for a minute…" **BULLSHIT.**
"If you’ve already watched the hearing, watch it again, but this time replace all mentions of ‘banks and financial institutions’ with ‘digital currencies and digital exchanges.’ The implications are really rather alarming." **NOWHERE DOES IT STATE REPLACE ANYTHING WITH DIGITAL CURRENCIES. IT IS ONLY BANKS w/EXCHANGES.
 bill criminalizes intentionally concealing ownership or control of a bank account.” was the ACTUAL QUOTE.
That's it.
Bank account would be amended to include "accounts on an exchange."
“§ 5333. Prohibition on concealment of ownership of account
**(a) In General.—No person shall knowingly conceal, falsify, or misrepresent, or attempt to conceal, falsify, or misrepresent, from or to a financial institution, a material fact concerning the ownership or control of an account or assets held in an account with a financial institution.**
I mean, obviously.
They're equating crypto exchanges with foreign bank accounts. you can't just hide money there.... well, you can, but it's already illegal to do so.
Again, this is about INSTITUTIONS/ACCOUNTS not "crypto holdings."
SEC. 13. PREPAID ACCESS DEVICES, DIGITAL CURRENCIES, OR OTHER SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS. (a) In General.—Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States Code, is amended—
(1) in paragraph (2)(K)—
(A) by inserting “prepaid access devices, digital currency,” after “money orders,”; and
(B) by inserting before the semicolon at the end the following: “, or any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency”;
 (K) an issuer, redeemer, or cashier of travelers’ checks, checks, money orders, or similar instruments;
so they're taking it out of context of ISSUER, REDEEMER or CASHIER.
TLDR: having a bitcoin wallet does not make you a bank.
Again, you wouldn't have to report your holdings, you'd have to report your holdings ON AN EXCHANGE.
So basically get the fuck out of here with this clickbait FUD.

That's the quote, not this horseshit from the link:
“criminalize [those] intentionally concealing ownership or control of a [digital currency or digital exchange] account.” Wow. Let this sink in for a minute…
Wow, learn to read you fucking wingding. Not sure what the agenda is here but please just think for yourself, this shitpost swapped bank with "digital currency" ... lol. And look at all the rabid claiming "how dumb must the government be that they would even try!" Obviously.

The lie on btc manager: “criminalize [those] intentionally concealing ownership or control of a [digital currency or digital exchange] account.” Wow. Let this sink in for a minute…
This has nothing to do with criminalizing crypto
In fact, these laws seem good to me -- and some of the least repulsive I've seen -- as their intent is weeding out nasty crime. The problem is when the law overreaches and can be used to suppress things that are not at all equivalent, etc.
 FUD is to encourage panic selling.

Of all the things in this thread to reply to, I would have definitely picked this one.
Binance is 100% a Chinese exchange (in every sense of the phrase) that has simply poorly machine translated their text into other localities. 


Tips: don't use semicolons like that. Email and Issue Type are not proper nouns and don't need capitalization. Feedback is not an appropriate CS function, feedback is what customers give companies. Stop pretending that it doesn't take 3 seconds to read an email and forward it to the appropriate International Tapestry of Multiculturalism Team Member, it's just another concern troll that the customer can "do it wrong" and that's why you're jacking off on any semblance of support.
But I'm sure you'll be happy to provide all of the documents regarding incorporation in all of these different localities, and not just that you skipped out of China to Japan to avoid the laws, and then Malta and what.. Jersey?
You could have an office on top of the statue of liberty and wear a fucking uncle sam mask while shooting AR-15s with apple pie bullets, you'd still be a Chinese exchange.
And it isn't racism anyway: dealing with products you always have to build a Chinese quality tax into it because the QA and CS is essentially dogshit... it's all about volume.

Bitcoin will never be able to do more than crawl. L2 will always be faster, and is like stating infants today will be equipped with rocket boots in the future and so will be faster than humans now.
The issue is whenever you say "hee hee ONE day things will be different it is met with jeers and idiocy." The problem is this is coming from the same people who missed the boat on seeing the value in bitcoin 7 years ago. 
That's why the negativity towards networks and the FUD that "well it will lose to a BETTER coin" is water off a duck's back if you have any type of longview.

Literally less than a week ago I posited that "there aren't that many positions over 10k" this was true then, and it's still true.
This means as it plummets, people selling between 10-20k are "profiting" 
The thing missing in all of this is the total amount of holdings at any given price point. Bitcoin could plummet to $1 and it would still be a massive profit for more than 8 million of the bitcoins, since 1/2 of the bitcoins were mined at $0.
Think about it this way: most of the bitcoin in existence sees a profit over $0.
Each position that was fiat purchased is tiny compared to the holding value at $0. 
So in this case the hype is endless. It can drop down to $1k right now, and there will be losers, sure, but that number is miniscule compared to the winners who sold over their investment.

Eh, it's not poor shaming.
It's simple math: save that asset, right? There is simply irony in that one of the most important voices in BTC did not follow the riskiest course of action. There are many people who did not, because it could just be throwing $300 away into the "scamcoin" ... at a time when gpu mining was yielding todays value of tens of thousands of dollars DAILY a $300 investment still seemed like "a lot."
And then all sound financial advice is always diversifying to mitigate risk... so even if you did that would you still have them today?
And so on...  it's really a dig at someone who is this prophetic voice of bitcoin did not have the faith and took the path of least resistance. $300 of bitcoin should not be making or breaking you, unless you literally live in poverty to the point that having an internet connection would be getting in the way of you eating.

No, they shouldn't. If you disagree with the current implementation, make your own implementation and test it in the market. Fuck the short-sighted, stupid valuation = importance nonsense. I want the most resilient coin and in some people's opinions bitcoin cash is it. I have no idea if it is, or is not it. I also don't give a fuck. I will make a risk assessment regarding holding or selling it, and how much it will or will not chip away at BTC's valuation. Remember, it's a hard fork and the amount of bitcoin that was in play when that fork happened FAR, FAR outweighs anyone "buying in" since then.
If you can pull off creating value with ForkCoin then more power to you.
I'm not going to play soothsayer and say "bitcoin WILL do x and bitcoin cash WILL do y" because that always gets modified based on market forces, and there are many, many instances where both did not do what was expected.
2 days ago nobody here would have said "hey coinbase is going to start trading BCH," right?
The massive amount of dust spam on the BTC network by bad actors taking relatively minor losses while controlling the mining is something that has an immediate market value + needs immediate attention. And the people that push it forward are going to have A LOT of centralized power. This is one of the things that BCH is fundamentally against, and some interpretations of the whitepaper say exactly as much. 
Say what you want about the efficiency of big blocks, or how they're pointless, providing that short term value store and "sikk gainz" is attractive to people. Never mind that it's actually usable right now, as well, and not just because nobody really answers "usable how?"
People getting anally anguished about a fucking 3rd party "exchange" and begging for 3rd party services and gov intervention... yeah, I don't see that in the whitepaper either. But here we are.

Uh, the fees are not bogus. 
I actually, recently, bought on steam. The exact user scenario that they detailed happened: the transaction stalled and then they wanted to make up the difference since the "price wasn't guaranteed" which would have required a 2nd transaction (more fees).
In short, unless you are spending mined coins (and in this anti-inflationary setup, even if you don't) you're an idiot to eat the transaction tax.

if anything says "professional establishment" it's having the term "shitcoin" on your website transactional section.
But let's logic it out:
1. Since that would be irrelevant to those who don't care about it, zero effect. +-0
2. Since those that do care would potentially be interested in seeing what qualifies as a shitcoin, they might look at it. Friction towards transactions = an opportunity for someone to interrupt/stop the transaction. -1
3. Since those that support what you might call a shitcoin, they might cancel the transaction. -1
4. You totally gain wicked lambo boy anti-shitcoiner cred +100000000
So that's -2 and +100000000 pretty easy decision IMO

all of it is ridiculous because crypto grew from 0 into what it is now.
taking any segment of that growth and giving a shit is ignoring how discovery even works.
The bottom line is that one day the entire world is going to be connected digitally and there will be 1 digital currency per "mega entity" be those countries, alliances, corporations.
That's it. Bitcoin is poised to be the shapeshifting entity that eventually forms the backbone to all of those things, because why wouldn't it? If someone can answer why it wouldn't, then we'd jump ship to that. It's how this all works.
But people are fuckin' naive if they think the future is going to resume "paper money" and seashell trading for value.
The question is, do we allow centralized banks to push and pull like the rothschilds began, or do we cut that cord? 
Nobody seemed to bat an eye when "the role of the bank" changed from "storing your money" to "using some of it as financial gain tools" so why should they care if it then turns into "is obsolete."

The thing I love the best about this is that people compare bitcoin fees to visa's + paypal's lack of fees, when really all it is is an obscuring of the fees: those fees are baked into the sell value of the items. If you think the customer isn't paying those fees out the wazoo you're an imbecile.
The difference is that bitcoin frontloads the fees and puts them squarely with the end user. 
What if bitcoin had recipients of the coin see the deposit immediately and have THEM pay the fees based on how soon they'd like to confirm the transaction? Why is that the payer responsibility?
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:27:43
the two major loops:
1. bots buying and selling to bots. With enough capital, the losses are easily covered by the increase in valuation. For example if you have 100 total coins that are valued at 100, and spend 10 of them (90 held) to increase the valuation to 112, that's a massive gain (90x112 &gt; 100x100).
2. miners spamming the chain with dust can prioritize their own spam while increasing TX needed to "get in" to their priorities. They pay nothing on the dust transactions since they "get the bounty back" and just inflate TX costs.
Both of these have been happening for years. And both of these are the reasons why bigger blocks DO NOT MATTER.
 the volume on exchanges have nothing to do with positions held or the valuations of each satoshi. anyone with major volume trades off book to not lower the price.

Some people don't see "the problem." In fact, having the problem is what spurs development. Not alarmist "psychic predictions" of what might be needed later. There is a much simpler solution to the current use-case of bitcoin and that's to let the big boys go through their price discovery without shitting on the current status as being anti"cup of coffee" coin.
Let some other coin get the volume and traction of BTC, and establish themselves in the market, and BTC secondary networks will follow to fit in. 
But pretending bitcoin is losing position in this hypothetical future market is the very definition of concern trolling. It's arguing against your imagination.

I'm not sure how you can assert that the fee problem is exaggerated. What would be valid is when people then follow it up with "...and we could solve that with bigger blocks." that it is suspicious, but not necessarily invalid (just usually).
That's the issue, it's not logical. The facts are simple. The blockchain has been under sustained dust attack for a long, long time by miners + people with enough BTC to sustain such a thing (especially when they recoup the fees when they mine some high % of the blocks). This clogs up the mempool and causes transactions to require higher, on average, fees to be processed quickly. 
Eventually it would even flat out prune transactions with fees too low, for example.
Now, you might state that the obvious "quick" (lol no) solution is to simply increase the block size. But all that would do is further incentivize the dust spammers to fill up the new block size while futher centralizing who can afford to run a node. 
The only acceptable argument against things like Lightning Network is that it is out of the scope of the original whitepaper to solve scalability problems off chain, ie, that by allowing lightning network is far more centralizing than increasing block size. The claim by the btc crowd is that a few corrupt actors in the core dev are pushing their own solutions in an underhanded way towards centralization and authority.
The claim by the bitcoin crowd is that a few corrupt actors in the bcash dev are only interested in profiting as much as possible by any means necessary, playing "ideologue" while really just making money off of the greater fools in bcash and trying to manipulate btc markets simultaneously.
The main reason these actions are obfuscated is that humans have a problem with large numbers and cannot fathom that people are playing around with 100s and 1000s of BTC that they gained at $0, and use that to manipulate the market that is precious about 0.0001 and 0.001 BTC. 
For all the antagonism that these "sides" have, the realization should be that all involved at a basic level have a massive multiple of investment in ALL of the major crypto, and causing a loss on one end doesn't necessarily mean they're losing. For the new adopters, sure, it might mean that in the short term. But realize for every hodler there is a seller... who are they?
We're talking people who haven't put a single dollar in bitcoin for years, because buying 0.0000001 is silly when their dollar a few years ago has already multiplied 20,000x ...

I'll play devil's advocate:
**Any change** is good for bitcoin as it is the little bit of solid information we know that actually forms "what bitcoin is." 
That is, steam adopting it is good for bitcoin because it put it out in front of more people. 
Steam removing the adoption is good for bitcoin because it further illuminates the problems that need to be addressed, and elucidates the endgame of bitcoin.
Yeah, I get it that it is disingenuous to claim a problem is good because you have the opportunity to fix it. But that's what I think.
Years ago it became somewhat clear to me that bitcoin itself would not be feasible for the mainstream public to use directly to buy coffee, subway, whatever. And that was without this insane volatility, it was simply a transaction rate (versus something like visa) analysis.
So yeah, while I don't think this is a wakeup call or anything, it makes bitcoin that much more "real" based on this change. That's all we have to go on.

And then you have apologists stating that "it was all due to them blowing btc on newegg, amazon cards, or steam" paying $50,000 for farming simulator 2016.
Realize this: the only people spending it are those grossly profiting from it due to buy-ins when it was in &lt; single digit valuation mode. Do you think someone who mined 25,000 bitcoin on a CPU gives a shit about even $1000 fees? No because to them the fees are a portion of their "free money" and were never $, and only crypto

The realization is that with the miniscule volume and the massive amount of old coin holders in bcash, it is so grossly manipulable that it can literally swing with 4 or 5 bots buying and selling to themselves, eating fees. 
Remember, those fees are 0 if you obtained the coins at 0 cost, taking even a few hundred hit each ping-pong is meaningless if you have 1000s of coins that gain that fat multiplier.
You could argue that exactly the same force is largely pumping btc as well.
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:26:17
To put this in perspective, think of it this way.
Say you had a sizable chunk and you were done with this and wanted to cash out. Your legal options are:
1. A whopping single payment. **Which your bank must report** if it goes over an uncertain threshold. Some say that's $10k for one transaction in the US which is odd that the IRS is going after Coinbase for $20k "in a year."
2. If you don't particularly need the money, perhaps you're selling slowly to emulate a paycheck and you're looking to minimize taxes, legally + within your rights, like any corporation in the USA. Oops, now you're guilty of "structuring" and, guess what, **your bank must report this** but not only that, you can be subject to seizure via civil forfeiture for IRS targeted cases and that account is wiped out. 
Which is extra dubious since if you're trying to focus on these funds as your main income (wrong word, but closest), now that is at risk.
That seizure idea was narrowed to be only relevant to "pursuing funds deemed to be gained illegally" because of all the stories of small businesses losing their entire account because they made small payroll deposits frequently. But that's the idea behind characterizing bitcoin as "that thing you use when you need anonymity to commit crimes."
Take that in with the concept that there are plenty of ways in which a depost and then withdrawal from a service means you might be receiving tainted coins (any coins that even passed through known "bad actor" ip addresses) means anyone can be labelled as such until the forensic investigations conclude.
Especially those who were using tumblers to try to anonymize their addresses/coins... even though it's clear that there are genuine privacy benefits to this, it can always be construed as "something you do when you have something to hide."
Now consider what percentage of this "new investment money" is 100% already marked by KYC type services, you can only conclude that this is the hunt for those who have sizable chunks to basically get rid of whatever anonymity might be left.
Of course that's "only relevant if you convert to fiat" but the writing is on the wall there

This is true with ANY business: never, ever push "cheaper, faster" as your business model.
It will ALWAYS lose to higher quality in the long run that eventually becomes cheaper and faster due to innovation and technology.
Luxury brands always scale easily and successfully downward. Shit peddling brands rarely ever scale up to luxury.
If I told you mcdonalds was opening a series of gourmet restaurants, you'd be skeptical. but if i told you the top gourmet restaurant was opening a chain of fast food places, you'd buy in to it.
someplace like amazon pushing cheaper goods and faster service by cutting out the middleman also offered the "same quality" service as competitors, if not higher (with the 2-day and instant hand delivery).

Confidence is a great word to describe insisting to someone who has no clue about the space that it is valuable and a "great deal" at $x valuation. There's a certain artistry to pulling that off, wouldn't you agree?
ALL bitcoin with stored value prior to december 6, 2017 has seen a gain of value. Bitcoin with stored value in the last 16 days is seeing a loss. One of those is 99% of all bitcoin, the rest is 1%.
Concern trolls are just awful. 
If you think confidence is destroyed in any way, you're literally fixated on 16 days of valuation over the previous thousands of days. I can link you to posts of real concern (gox scams, etc) where people were so timid about bitcoin crashing to $90 or $300 without the technology changing meaningfully. Yet here we are.
Any sane analysis "saw this coming." It is only a surprise if you haven't been around for every end of year sell off (that's happened substantially for 5 years now. 
But yeah, hurr durr it's the NeW ToXiC TrOlLCoIn causing the issue.

I hear so much about "it's easy to buy bitcoin" and "convert your assets here" but hear nothing about the other end, IE, who's "cashing out" and how.
Every buyer has a seller. All the people "hodling" still require someone selling to gain or assert any value.
Currency crises and unruly investments aside, if I'm this pretend "poor person in an unstable economy" and somehow I store all my assets in bitcoin so I don't lose them, what is the endgame there to actually get them back after the crisis subsides?

But all of the major coins are up 50 to 80% in the last month. 
This thread and posts like this are literally retarded. Yes, a shitcoin can assist in toppling bitcoin valuation. HURR DURR. 
The reality is that all outside market forces, all technological forces, are an aggregate towards price discovery when the volume is low. 
If you're in it to "make a profit" and you're basically dumb about what the real forces are, obviously you're going to assign blame with a low accuracy % regarding what "caused" it.
Look at the top 20 crypto valuations, and how there is a strong correlation with their changes every december. 
99.999999% of the reason for this is end-of-year taxation, and legislation that gets snuck in before the holidays. But we have these shitposts on the frontpage instead of the useful info like
that might better inform people. Shrug.
If you're looking at anything less than 1- 3- 6- or 1year changes, you're literally the greater fool. Every single person selling now has a buyer. Ohhh god confidence is down! Yet, for every person "selling down" apparently "at a loss" has someone happy to take the coins off their hands. Weird how that works!
Remember when 13k was the ATH for like 1 day? Remember how people were hesitant to purchase between 10-13k because of how much it spiked, and how rapidly?
You'd think we were at &gt;13k for years with how fucking idiotically butthurt people are about this valuation and the subsequent correction.
Did something change in the technology to warrant it going from 8k to 19k? What did I miss, because I didn't see absolutely any "reason" for this. 
Where did all the posts mocking shorting bitcoin go? 'member when that was the fashionable shitpost on the frontpage?

this is why localbitcoins is some large % honeypots and heavily monitored.
It takes a lot longer than 30 seconds to monitor all that. If you send me $20 worth of bitcoin and I sell it to my_friend for $20, you're telling me that "they know" within 30 seconds that I deposited $20 via bitcoin that Poison_Frank gave me? Or that my_friend got the bitcoin from me who got it from you? No.

talking about the negatives about bitcoin in this volume, the day that lightning network has a huge spike in usability testing stinks like shit.
There is no "tech" to discuss: 
1. big blockers are idiots
2. big blockers flocked to one coin to play greater fool circle jerks with each other
3. big blockers are miners, the same miners + "early adopters" using their leverage to spam this blockchain with dust
4. the argument that LN is a "centralizing force" as it doesn't solve scalability on-chain is literally moronic.
The reason why you don't see asswipes dust spamming BCH is that it doesn't matter in the long run. Proving lack of scalability at that scale could only come from the people perpetrating the attack in the first place, the rest of us want to further the technology.
But sure, please, just go to the other coin that does exactly what you think "will fix things." Please, abandon ship, go join the elysium fields of a bigger block fixing all the problems. Go join the "for really real" bitcoin that was established by a bunch that I believe combined had less than a few hours of core dev time, they clearly are "the future."
And I'm not saying that sarcastically: go, prove how bad bitcoin is and how better something else is. The money will follow it. 
But by all means, please stop and think that asking the same fucking questions over and over again that were resolved literally years ago, and being met with hostility or repetition, is anything but predictable. We can resolve this nicely and just boil it down to a philosophical difference of opinion. The flat out antagonism from the btc side, and the 2x idiocy, more than proves the positions here.

@_date: 2017-12-22 06:47:47
Yeah definitely not because of these speculation posts being everywhere, and pushing the real news down:
Does this "clue you in" more?
Paying taxes on every exchange between btc&lt;&gt;shitcoin wouldn't cause any selloffs now, NAH, MMMM let's keep guessing, FUD, and us vs. them when the ENTIRE SPACE has lost value.
Definitely not because of the new shorts that are now backed by huge market muscle.
No, it must be because of some pissing match that literally only impacts some tiny fraction of the people who have any btc or b'cash, and no real world implications at all. Durrrrrp. Definitely not a few bad actors who have unlimited access to convert between any crypto to get gains.
Think about it, if you had backdoor access to an exchange and could exchange BTC&lt;&gt;alt/shitcoin at will and get 0 tax events happening, how you could easily ladder profits both on the way up AND down. 
Think of what happens to the volume when you can no longer do that.
If you don't think there was insider pump/dump action on converting bch/btc massively that hasn't been throttled and controlled to ride out the predictable dips + surges when trading is turned on and off, I don't know what else to tell you. spoiler: having more of the coin that's losing LESS % or gaining MORE % is better than having less of it, in any portfolio.
if you have $18k of value in $15k:1btc and $3k:1bch, when btc loses 10% of that value and bch only loses 5% of its value, you end up at 13.5k + 2850 = 16350
Or, you immediately transfer all of your btc into bch, then lose 5% total = $17,100.
Look at the BCH and BTC charts stacked on top of each other. Wow, funny how much correlation they have, eh?
But gosh, now look at what happens if you're taxed on that transfer. But nah, couldn't have anything at all to do with "value storing" being chipped away at by big gov :)
But, but, that would make you a prediction psychic! Yes, it would, unless... say... you knew exactly when and what orders were going to be purged, fulfilled, and when pumps and dumps were going to happen. But hey, insider trading shouldn't be illegal!

No it isn't.
Where do you get that from? BITCOIN's is, but I can create a bitcoin clone or fork that completely centralizes mining and use it as some form of currency.


Try this scenario: All miners are government, and to get the token you have to provide credentials + proof of IP address / wallet ownership, making it fully centralized and documented of who holds what. 
Seems simple + valuable enough.
The reasons why government won't do that have more to do with power structures being dictated by $$$ than any lack of blockchain functionality.

Any interactive change with bitcoin is good for bitcoin. 
If the value dropped to $0 and everyone abandoned it, it would be good for bitcoin.
"Good for bitcoin" in this context is additional information to consider when forming what bitcoin is.
In your sense you have an agenda that declares "only if XYZ happens is it 'good for bitcoin'" but how do you get closer to XYZ happening if there isn't input towards that end... merchant adoption decreasing being one of them.
Bitcoin has always operated regarding a trustless, greed-driven system that addressed needs and reacted to them. Steam abandoning bitcoin (if we are to believe that this is 100% only due to transactions and not an incoming fedgov hammer) will give a case study that before was only conjecture regarding how shitty the user experience is.

fail at what, exactly. How does a bitcoin "failure" scenario work? Total lack of value to keep mining? Then miners go away and we're back to CPU mining? Oh no, how horrible.
A small bank conglomerate can buy 100% of the bitcoin that is on exchanges right now, and for the next year. But you're worried about... the people WITH bitcoin destroying it? LOL.
I'm far more worried on some sort of blanket ban where the last of the regulated exchanges get a hammer dropped on them and there is 0 legal interface with it. That's the destruction, as far as I can tell, and that's selective. 
But to blame early adopters + the powers that be that started it? I dunno, welcome to every currency ever?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:08:21
irrelevant: more transactions = more positions = more accurate valuations.
You realize that the actual volume of trades represents a tiny, tiny fraction of actual btc holdings, right?

@_date: 2017-12-18 17:37:16
Not necessarily a scam, but depending on the jurisdiction possibly illegal.
bitcoin has increased 140% in 30 days. So lets say the investment started 30 days ago... you can see where the profit comes from.
The red flag is why it is "mining" AND "investment." 
Investment is fine, but what are you actually "getting" out of it. Because you are not getting insurance, and there isn't anything much to manage besides someone just buying the crypto with that investment. 
If they are buying shares in a mining operation, those ALWAYS are less profitable than just purchasing the btc outright. They have to be or else there'd be no profit in the mining shares... why lose $$$ when you could just keep the coin?
So their entire service is writing down in a google sheet $X received at "Ybtc" valuation. Then depending on the exchange they're using the fees are baked in to that valuation, the transaction rates, etc. And... that's it.
Unfortunately the scam gets revealed when valuation stops meeting that 15% interest benchmark. And that wouldn't happen for 10 months given this first month's windfall. Unless... Are they paying dividends immediately? Because if so that means any one month of drops would eat into investment immediately.
In the end, an exercise would be just flat out going to coinbase and spending your investment there, and then keep track of how that would have performed with this investment scheme... you'll clearly see it always performing better.

Someone's bot done fuckin goof'd, and all they needed to do was wait a little bit before pumping but, you know, they're greedy because they know there's no fuckin' real value there.

Yes, you can sell 55 bitcoin at once through coinbase. I have no idea about GDAX or anywhere else.
Coinbase's limit with "not all the way verified but partially" is $50k a week. That is, you can only sell $50k and it goes directly to a bank account. It doesn't sit there in "database dollars" until your limit is open again. So that means with coinbase itself you're not cashing all 55 out. You'd be doing ~4 at a time every week, depending on the price of course.
Coinbase isn't an exchange. They're a buyer and seller. OP didn't answer "which exchange" allowed this, and so on.

Uh, have you ever actually made these types of orders? I'm not using logic, I'm using practice.
Besides, even with all the panic selling that'd happen - that would actually lower the valuation of bitcoin, not increase it. Either way the fantasy of selling all the way down to clear out the orderbook is far more realistic than the fantasy of "selling 100% of all bitcoins at the current price 1 sold at."

There are a lot of things we're missing by focusing on the price, the main one is that the volume actually establishing that price is so extremely meaningless/insubstantial that a laughable amount of sales could remove 90% of its value.
I'd love to see a chart of the real value of everyone's bitcoin: how much $$$ was spent for that btc that anyone has.
I'd assert that an extremely low amount were actually purchased above $10,000 relative to the total created since genesis. Look at the trade volumes on exchanges... 
Then you take the amount mined and just held since mining, and so on. People seeing this arbitrary, unrealistic valuation and running with it is concerning, "but it doesn't matter if you just hodl"

It's only hilarious to children that don't understand basic tax law.
If you willingly change the amount of transactions to obscure information, avoid reporting, avoid taxation: that's called structuring and is illegal.
People doing cash payrolls and having lots of deposits close to the flag limit but miraculously never going over are stung all the time by it, google it.
In other words, those accounts that miraculously had $19,999.99 of transactions at coinbase are infinitely more suspicious to the IRS than those who arbitrarily went over $20k
Likewise at a bank doing a $9,999.99 transaction repeatedly to not hit a $10,000.00 reporting auto flag is also silly and more obvious.
The problem with this is what if I just want to cash out $X at a time for no good reason. Because it raises suspicion, etc, I can be stung. the flipside is if i lump sum do it, it automatically is deemed suspicious or noteworthy.

Think of it this way: what happens when bitcoin's userbase doubles?
all of this nitpicky position wrangling and daytrading volume does not add up to "having more BTC."
To put it another way, if you plan to invest $100 weekly in btc and then it goes up to $110, the maximum profit is not selling at $110 to realize the gains, it is spending another $100 on .91 bitcoin
The biggest "winners" so far are those who maximized bitcoin holdings for the increases, not those diversifying.

it only takes ~$120 million to wipe out GDAX sell book down to $1k, and that's only a purchase of tens of thousands (out of millions) of coins.
TPTB can legislate and criminalize it so that any use of it is simply put CrimeCoin... they don't have to "Attack" because at any moment they can push through criminalizations and declarations.
On these forums you have people saying "ha ha one day it will be a threat" in the same post that someone else says "why aren't we being attacked already!?" ... because it isn't a threat yet. Also, if the bank conglomerate simply bought out all bitcoin and made it's usability tied in with KYC and etc, this "revolutionary currency" ends up being what some were fighting against: totally anti-anonymous 100% digital money tied directly to an individual and tracked entirely.
It only takes a little bit of maneuvering for bitcoin to be the fedgovcoin... people're assuming that an attack would be to destroy and not control.
Just wait for a high profile case (silk road was too early, I'm convinced it was a honeypot full of bullshit actors and a fallguy) where bitcoin is tied in with human/drug/slave trafficking, ie, "they were able to evade forensics due to bitcoin and that's bad therefore bitcoin is bad" and you'll know exactly the moment when banks and fedgovs decided it was a threat to the existing power structures.
All that russian hacker trump shit? 100% guaranteed crypto will be linked to it at some point, and that will tie crypto to "shady politicians using it to evade campaign limits" etc. 
The banks and politicians (except for the fogeys) know the fuckin' utility, it takes 3 seconds to see it's intrinsic value compared to the reporting / bureaucracy they're entangled with.
Another angle is that bitcoin gets rid of the intermediaries that set up the shadow networks in the first place. You no longer need a bagman or dark accounting. It's like the squarespace of webdev

No it doesn't. It creates the simple legal precedent that if you obscure crypto holdings (by lying) when crossing the border, then are later proven to actually have held (via conversion to fiat or whatever other cyber-sleuthing) then they can and will inquire about why you lied about it in the first place.
So no, not "anyone" holding bitcoin but anyone who crosses the border and lies about it or covers it up. And I think that's bad enough without hyperbole that LOL GOV IS MAKING PRIVATE KEYS ILLEGAL CHILD SLAVERY

I can write (and get sent away to a dungeon prison by TPTB) "this is worth 100,000,000,000 ShitPoints" on a sheet of paper and trade that to someone, now it's up to them to find someone else to realize the value of 100,000,000,000 ShitPoints. Especially when I have a relatively unending supply of those ShitPoints based on "how easy it was for me to accumulate them."
Regarding the first automobiles, there are many iterations of automobiles and automobile maker that got crushed under the competition and "regulation" until there was one established winner. And those entities that squirted out the other side of the meat grinder have full government support. Look up the history of auto company bailouts in the name of "public good."
If you think that support and infrastructural reformation is going to treat crypto as the thing to preserve and not the current banking system I'd fear you don't know how much money is out there and the "massive gainz" of bitcoin are still insignificant outside of starting to be big enough of a problem that &gt;0 attention needs to be paid to it.
We're only seeing the first blip on the radar of the meteor or comet that is crypto and a lot of these pro-crypto posts are essentially asserting that the world is going to just move on top of that ufo and not try to obliterate it to preserve the planet that it's hurtling towards.

It's odd because we see all of these humblebrag "good luck" or "cashed out" threads but never "it was easy, i used ____ exchange, and cashed out ____ times over the course of _____ days/weeks/months. this required me to sell at ____, ______ (unfortunate dip) and ______ lucky peak. I had ______, ______, ______ banks for each of my accounts and that put me at _______ bracket for taxes."
And this coming from a "duh-hyuck" random coin find / pseudo-incompetence, yet they forget the most detailed and nerve wracking part of it is in that fiat conversion. 
Lump summing the 55 coins to an exchange is exceedingly stupid, and any exchange has limits weekly, so you'd be ideally sending it over time and selling it over time AND not able to sell lump sum. So when you staggered the sales, what positions did you sell out with?
THOSE are the stories that would be interesting to people here who've seen 99999999999 threads about cashing out, that all seem to miss those details.

The realization is that for someone who was in early enough, the valuation is "huh ok, shrug." 
Bitcoin could be valued at $1 and that wouldn't change its utility.
People daytrading on GOX, BTCe (rip trollbox), etc and using some sort of arbitrary "conversion from this new crypto that might be the best one yet" valuation always seemed bullshitty to me, so understanding that a crash happens when a bullshit exchange was being manipulated to its breaking point is pretty straightforward. 
What I'd love to see is a valuation chart of all the bitcoin positions in existence, how much it was actually purchased for vs. mined. I do not believe it is sane to refer to market caps assuming that 100% of the bitcoin out there could be sold for the current selling price. Look at the volumes.
That sort of nonsense is what made the mt.gox CENTRALIZATION (it happened multiple times with them before the big one, remember) so obnoxious: the lag is godawful on any exchange, and a simple DDOS would cause "omg panic selling" because the safe assumption was that it was high volume periods.
The other markets around btc were almost nonexistent, as well, you had to risk an in-person type trade. fundbois were using it to buy xanny bars on silk road and that's about it. There were some really good people who disappeared really quick when all the MSB guidance and rumblings of devs visiting the FBI started locking people up around btc.
The one thing I appreciated a lot more was there was way less childish "meme" culture surrounding it, until a few shitcoins that were memes themselves came out. 
One laughable highlight were all the reddit tip bots that were out there. I laugh at people thinking "ah, shit" when they realized they tipped $10,000+ on shitposts. But, you know, without them "the valuation" wouldn't be where it is today!
A friend who let the stresses of crypto finally snap him, RIP, was more excited about the idea that he "was right about it" than that it was valuable. I mean, that too, obvssss but y'know...
For everyone with a "oh man all my investments went in the toilet" there are far more people who's investments were $0 or tinkering on their computer to get thousands of btc... so i'd say the biggest difference is that (aside from flat out loss of coins which happened in a few large scale scams, mtgox included) today people seem so fixated on that $ valuation as some sort of rationalization of bitcoin's worth. And for all the well-meaning information on this subreddit (or how clogged the original forum got with schemes or shitposts) it is vastly overshadowed by people trading baseball cards

What if you mine? According to the legislation I've seen mining is income at current fair value? Someone mining 1,000 in 2010 would have fair value of like $8.00, which wouldn't be reportable.
How are the IRS treating Bitcoins?
The IRS produed guidance in 2014 on the specific treatment of Bitcoins and other crypto-currencies, which has helped clarified the situation. Essentially:
- Bitcoin is a personal property, not a currency, and so is taxed as a capital asset
- Gains made from converting Bitcoins into a fiat currency are subject to capital gains tax
- Purchases of goods or services with Bitcoins must also account for gains
- **Bitcoins and other alt-coins obtained from mining is recognised income immediately at their fair value**
- Mining equipment can still be deducted as a legitimate business expense
So now they sell $10,000,000 and what do they report, and where? 
Selling at that point is not subject to cap gains, yes? Or is it?

BUT, it is also conflating what "fault" means. 
You are "at fault" for negligence when you leave your keys on the roof and someone steals your car, and you try to get insurance out of it. You're not "at fault" for car theft.

Nobody here knows anything, and it could still be relatively worthless. Don't forget that hyping value is part of any pump+dump scheme and 99% of the posts on this forum are indistinguishable from blatant hyping to try and snare the next person into buying. The latest "hodl" frenzy is just another one of these tactics, where every hodlr requires someone to have sodl to them. in the first place, unless they're mining. 
Another thing to forget is that there people where $100, $1000 or $10,000 of investment is trivial to them, so they buy in and have nothing to lose from endlessly hyping things... they're taking advantage of the hesitant by their stories of phat gainz or whatever, when it was a much easier decision for them. 
I remember a poster saying they'd rather have a fancy lunch than spend $100 on bitcoin when that would be worth a few million right now. Shrug.

That's the "secret hesitance" that many are not willing to spout off about, but reading between the lines is simple. People on these forums are already doing touchdown dances about how this horribly low fluidity and absurdly miniscule adoption rate means the USD is toppled and banks are over.

the main difference can be found in satoshi, years and years ago-- stated in response to someone trying to up btc's transactions/sec to paypal level--opting instead that "if needed" the code would be something that could dynamically change the block maximums.
b'cash system is just some centralized force arbitrarily deciding "here's the blocksize because THE POWERS THAT BE says so," rather than a democratically + predictably arrived at solution.
And so you get b'cash shills rubbing the tps/clogging in bitcoiners' faces to rationalize the fact that they're essentially supporting this centralized dictatorship because it's going well.
Everyone loves the war that the dictator starts when the country prospers, but when it fails everyone points fingers at this "evil entity" for this grand deception.
The real truth is that THE POWERS THAT BE profit on both sides of the fence, which is what disgusts older players in the space... the new folks are just following the promise of pennies from heaven from someone who can show off their pennies, and use their ill-gotten gains to influence media, markets, tech, whatever.
This is why the "haha you're dumb if you buy into bitcoin" argument is used, the conscripted soldiers have been indoctrinated to support "their" coin and find the greater fools to profit off of.

Some simple math:
To go from $1,000 to $10,000 is 10x the investment at +$9,000
To get that same 10x investment at $10,000 is +$90,000 ($81,000 more value needed to get the same gain).
Then consider someone who had invested at 0.01. They've seen that multiplier happen 6x already.
the issue: the volume required to push something from 0.01 to 10.00 is FAR less risk than that same multiplier at a higher volume.
It's like saying "1,000 people spent $10 to push it from 0.01 to 10.00 (1000x gain!!!!!!!) it's totally the same thing for 1,000 people to spend ~$200,000 to get the next 1000x gain!!!!

The part you're omitting is when an exchange clearly manipulates the prices on a piece of shit like that, the only sane follow-up question is "what other manipulation have you done?"
Now I'd like to believe that coinbase has a good enough rake on every transaction and enough wingdings who just sell outright at a massive loss to market, that they wouldn't stoop to corruption like this. But, uh, look at every online poker system or any other RL casino "unspoken rules."

That might have more weight if the core implementation actually used segwit. Relying on the enduser to make the software functionally viable? Good luck with that. 
It'd be like having an email software service that allows you to spoof headers and send to anyone at any time. Those existed in the wild west days of email, and quickly buckled under the weight of the spammers, but gosh if only the users used it "properly" there'd be no problems.
Obviously people should be using segwit but it's not exactly a simple onboarding and smooth sailing to embrace and encourage adoption. That could have been changed with a simple reference client stating "this is mandatory now"

It's called making money on both sides of the fence. 
They're not going to accept crypto until they can get in on it. And when they do, it's over. 
We laugh about the friction of, say, coinbase now, but can you imagine if Chase and BOA had their own exchanges?
It would be effortless and trivial to set up for the banking conglomerates, to basically crush coinbase out of relevancy by offering a competitive service that runs better with the blessing + full KYC/AML regulation and insurance that the gov will pat them on the head for.

none of your points address the topic or offer anything but a circlejerk.
the point remains: there is more recourse when dealing with a local entity than a foreign entity. No matter who you are or where you are.
your "believe me" and "I don't trust" bullshit is useless.
The endgame of crypto is 100% trustless, so, the fact that you're begging for trust and stating opinions of trust is literally con artistry.
But I guess you prefer some sort of "if you get fucked you should have no recourse" wild west life, and the pure intentions of some of the protective measures put in place are lost on you. 
Also as to Binance's intent, willful negligence is equivalent to direct thievery. If they ignore 100% of the "oopsie made a mistake" that is as good as / indistinguishable from actively taking it. There are plenty of well documented customer service / broken system scams where they can claim "growing pains / inadequate resources" while they rub your money all over their dicks

Valuation charts without considering volume are idiotic. For example, yes, someone traded a pizza for 10k. That is a volume of maybe a handful of trades.
Do a volume chart. 
The volume is still hovering ATH levels, even with lowered valuation. This means confidence is almost exactly where it was when it was at ~$20k, when it is down 50% in value.
As more volume happens, more price discovery happens, and less volatility happens. 
Right now, any volume "spikes" are hand in hand with valuation swings, because the volume is so very, very low.
More volume is what we're after. All the bullshit about confidence lost or "hey this isn't a currency" are just new weak hands wringing themselves.

This law is set for Jan 1, and won't be relevant to your situation.
In fact, the entire purpose for this law is to clarify the grey area that causes your coins to look like "LaunderingCoins." 
Any exchange that is operating legally would have been reporting and keeping records of those exchanges. Any conversion triggering a tax event (now including crypto to crypto exchange) would require "proof" moving forward.
Regarding mining profits, you're supposed to have been declaring those as income. 
Your taxes would then reveal at audit time something rather simple:
1. 201X: mined 1 bitcoin, declared it at Y value and paid appropriate income tax
2. 201XX: sold 1 bitcoin for YY and paid appropriate capital gains taxes based on X-XX timespan
The best case scenario for you, and a forensic audit, would be having the ability to trace the transactions back to the default exchange's wallets or those original mined blocks.

saying your money will be worth more tomorrow is the definition of "don't spend." and then you get these hodl retards colluding while the utility of bitcoin itself dwindles or is left open-ended.
I personally hope bitcoin devalues to $0 while maintaining it's utility as "the" POW system, and everyone treating it like daytrading scurries to the next MoneyCoin and fucks off away from bitcoin.

Huh? Buyers filling orderbooks have nothing to do with wiping out all sales. If you spent $200million on cleaning out the book down to $1k, how much does the next BTC go for?
Trade volume does matter (not as a representation in USD, but as raw number of bitcoins moving). Market cap does not. That is a fantasy number representing the pretend concept of 100% of bitcoins selling for the "current price." Which in your own post points out the impossibility of it. 
The number that I find the most interesting is a sort of moving average taking 1/2 - 3/4 of the sell orders on an exchange. These are positions that people "wouldn't mind selling at" which assumes that those are profit points, or at the very least break even points. 
That's the closest thing we have to a position analysis, since there are no brokers making these deals to collate the information, coinbase + any exchange runner has a nice tabulation of every single bitcoin position, so they know exactly what to expect in terms of plateauing when sell-offs happen.
The trade volume as some sort of multiplication off of valuation is silly. you could trade 10,000 bitcoins years ago for the same value you could trade 0.001 today.
I stand by the idea that there are relatively few positions above $10k right now as evidenced by how weak the books are.

so you're telling me that someone who turned on their CPU and the bitcoin core GUI and clicked the "start mining" button in 2009/2010, who literally ended up with thousands of bitcoins at basically 0 cost, depends on YOU?
sorry bro but there are people who could sell 1 bitcoin every day for the rest of their lives and still not even make a dent in their holdings, and not impact the market negatively at all.
Besides, your point doesn't even come to terms with the fact that anyone wiping out the sell book would, you know, be cashing out and thus not give a fuck about the rest of their valuations after it goes through. But somehow according to your logic someone fucking up bitcoin by cashing out their multi-millions can't do that because their wealth would be impacted? Derp.
The logic remains: if bitcoin got to where it is right now, it can do it again even if it crashes to $0.01
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:19:12
That makes no sense. Think about it.
For $150 million you get 18,000 coins. The average cost per coin is $8,333.33 and that's a small fraction of "all coins in existence." But you've literally taken all of the sales out of an entire exchange. 
Who is going to post a coin for sale at $12,000 after the price drops to $1,500?
So then "the price will be normal again" is very true, but the new normal will be very, very low. 
And if it ever does "go back to $12,000" well gosh you could make $4,000 per coin just by selling down to the $8,333.33 price.
My point is, we're celebrating things that are indications of how risky/vulnerable bitcoin is.
$150 million to destroy the sell book on gdax? Silly.

You're claiming that btc isn't perfect because value was assigned to it and people don't like the fees.
In a closed network, the blockchain works fine without any increase and can leverage a layer2 protocol for speed. 
Everything else fucks up centralization. And that's not a profiteering issue, it's an issue of vulnerability.

It's not even a good analogy. Perfect? Ugh.
1. it's like saying THE BANK WHERE YOU WERE HACKED IS INSECURE, not the treasury.
2. bitcoin's USER EXPERIENCE MAP relies on exchanges to exchange btc for $$$ and essentially for goods. Yes, you can just keep it in a wallet and not use it (hodl pumper's wet dream). crypto does not have the universality of noncrypto at the moment
3. you don't owe money and lose the account when "hacked" and there are transaction reversals, unlike crypto. 
All of these things are not necessarily bad if you want it as a store of value. they are however all garbage if you want it to be a currency.

How so? They're manipulating that market so fucking hardcore it is hilarious.
They're trying to position b'cash as a hedge against bitcoin. Sorry but if 100% of the people who wanted to convert b'cash-&gt;fiat or bitcoin were allowed to without this horseshit "oops it's not allowed, err it was a bug, err ... uhhh" stop and go nonsense that'd be one thing.
The fact that they're disallowing trading of something shows how complicit they are with holding and trying to get "free value" out of it.
Ask yourself this: what reason would they have to give a fuck about how "out of control" b'cash's valuation was? It is 100% the exact same technology to implement trading of b'cash as bitcoin.

it isn't a "true believer" if you hold until you don't need to cash out and can just spend the crypto directly. at that point, there is no difference between fiat and crypto itself, just the systems around each. right now, 3rd party old-money systems MUST be involved.

Corporations are considered people, and corporations are being protected via the lawmakers hand in glove.
You seem to be omitting that the governments are representing people who get rich when things like this happens. It would be less naive to claim that a powerful corporation in the US (or the illuminati of "what suppresses the most") ordered this hit of a rogue profiteer than to state that "people are violated."
the us gov considered this a bad actor, and by reflexive considers something else a good actor. And the gov is under the auspices of having the US prosper as a whole. In their eyes this is the big business that lines the coffers, of course.
I guess you can refer to your idealism all day long, but then don't be surprised when the reality of how the system actually works shows itself.

 what? This reads as clickbait. Ignore this FUD to get clicks.
This does not say what this title says, "concealed **ownership of cryptocurrency**"


Huge difference.


 I mean, obviously.
They're equating crypto exchanges with foreign bank accounts. you can't just hide money there.... well, you can, but it's already illegal to do so.
Again, this is about INSTITUTIONS/ACCOUNTS not "crypto holdings."
SEC. 13. PREPAID ACCESS DEVICES, DIGITAL CURRENCIES, OR OTHER SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS.
(a) In General.—Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States Code, is amended—
(1) in paragraph (2)(K)—
**(A) by inserting “prepaid access devices, digital currency,” after “money orders,”; and**
(B) by inserting before the semicolon at the end the following: **“, or any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency”;**
(K) an issuer, redeemer, or cashier of travelers’ checks, checks, money orders, or similar instruments;
so they're taking it out of context of ISSUER, REDEEMER or CASHIER. 
TLDR: having a bitcoin wallet does not make you a bank.
Again, you wouldn't have to report your holdings, you'd have to report your holdings ON AN EXCHANGE.
So basically get the fuck out of here with this clickbait FUD.

the actual quote was:


That's the quote, not this horseshit from the link:


Wow, learn to read you fucking wingding. Not sure what the agenda is here but please just think for yourself, this shitpost swapped bank with "digital currency" ... lol. And look at all the rabid claiming "how dumb must the government be that they would even try!" Obviously.

The proposal: 
The lie on btc manager:
“criminalize [those] intentionally concealing ownership or control of a [digital currency or digital exchange] account.” Wow. Let this sink in for a minute…
**This has nothing to do with criminalizing crypto**
In fact, these laws seem good to me -- and some of the least repulsive I've seen -- as their intent is weeding out nasty crime. The problem is when the law overreaches and can be used to suppress things that are not at all equivalent, etc. 
It just alerts me that people try to take an attack on true crime as "an attack on everyone" like I'm going to defend the bogus uses for their sake? Newp. Again, sure, of course this could be a direct attack but the language seems clear and the obfuscation is coming from this shitpost blog.

GDP and market cap is a fucking stupid comparison, that's why you're being downvoted. Market caps on fucking crypto are pretend. They do not reflect any real world, tangible thing. They are determined largely by unverifiable "self trades" and unregulated exchanges that could simply be making shit up at 0 loss to them. 
Here's a crypto market cap: 100 coins are distributed at $1 each. Now someone buys 1 coin at $1,000,000. Wow! The market cap is $1,000,000x100! Bullshit.
The true answer would be 99 coins are valued at $1 and 1 coin at $1,000,000. Now take the median of that. (I know, advanced mathematics required). Spoiler: it's $1.
Just like if you actually took the exchanged value of every bitcoin. Like attached "what this btc was valued at in $$$ when it changed hands" you'll find that even $6k is grossly overvalued and has no bearing on reality. 
Some people just don't get why it is valued, and why $20k was waaaay ahead of schedule, what determines the schedule, and so on.
1/2 of all bitcoin in existence was mined at a valuation of &lt;$50.  
That gives a fuckton of leeway regarding losing transaction costs to prop up bullshit valuations.
x1000 is some shitty strawman. I mean, bitcoin went from 0 to 6k. Someone explain what "growth multiplier" that is? Infinite!?
So lets be realistic. People would cream their jeans, 100% of people with bitcoin that care about price would literally throw the biggest fuck you party, if it went up not even 4x. 
50x from where we are is projected to be one of the "all the money in the world is now bitcoin" valuations. 
Is somewhere in between even realistic? Who knows.
But to lament that we're not going to go from $6,000 a coin to $6,000,000 a coin, like we did from $6 to $6,000 (or $20 to $20,000) is pretty absurd.

The scam is that bitcoin.com's app is recommending bitcoin cash?
That's reaching a bit.
Hell, if I was them and I ran that app I wouldn't even show bitcoin core as an option.
b'cash has every right to believe their fork/version of bitcoin is "the bitcoin" and can use every tactic at their disposal to push that forward. if it was so important to bitcoin to have bitcoin.com, a bitcoin twitter, a bitcoin.com ceo, an app that recommends a shitcoin, it would have happened.
It is not important, and THE GREAT FILTER is between those who can learn enough to know the difference.

Problem is, modern democracy is:
1. corporations + 1% donate to me
2. i use the donations to get votes
3. i do whatever i want as long as it keeps those donations incoming
That aside:
It is a basic problem of democracy that you can have too much democracy and it has a flattening / equalization effect where the unwashed masses would always vote to strip the 1%, the successful, anyone who has something they don't have... of it.
If you actually put bitcoin regulation to a vote (totally democracy, right?) all of the people who are computer illiterate would vote against it. That's easily 75% of the populace. Now throw in those who are suspicious of it, or simply didn't "get in early." Now throw in all of the people who are interested in preserving their current investments and bitcoin is seen as a devaluing force against it. And finally, throw in anyone who's spiteful or simply incapable of acting on it.
The ridiculously slim minority that are smart enough to see the benefit and wealthy enough to do (or have done) anything about it would lose that "vote" so completely.
So your 17 year old mentality rhetoric aside, the reason why there isn't "true democracy" is that the flattening effect would actually resemble something more like a mutated communism. If you think the left-leaning "special snowflake" mentality is bad now, think of how a democracy entirely run by the populace would shit on anything that makes anyone else feel left out or diminished. no thanks

you telling me that bcash doesn't come out with bitcoin.biz LN wallet that you'd all be pulling each other's pants down to be the first to slob on that knob? meh
bcash has exactly the same scalability issue, they're just not being dust attacked and will keep upping the block size until there are only massive pools capable of running a node. hmmm *sniff sniff* smells like centralization.
I personally don't give a shit which coin succeeds, but pretending on-chain scalability is possible is a fuckin' issue that has been addressed and debunked for 6 years.
yet here we are, the major holders spamming the network to get people to jump ship and get the greater fools buying into ForkCoin.
Great PR really - now the 2nd layer of the MLM scheme that is ForkCoin will easily convince the 3rd layer newbies that THIS is the "more usable" coin (though I'm not seeing any adoption outside of pumpers and dumpers back and forth pooping into each other infinitely).
I mean, the % of bitcoin or bcash held by new entrants since the fork is probably less than 0.5% of all coin out there, the big players have both bcash and bitcoin so it is really just a flavor more than anything else. 
I'm not wagering on anything but it is my personal opinion that L2&gt;bigger blocks regarding staying decentralized. I see the dust spam as an attack that only benefits miners who can already crush the network.
Are you telling me that coindance is wrong about showing the miner monopoly?

Here's an idea: stop giving power to the US via using US controlled entities and there you go. Seizing domains, not having TOR, zero KYC, using the marshall islands... 
it's like wearing camouflage but standing against a white wall. 
like it or not, the US is using resources to be the world police, and any "internet exchange" is synonymous with "money laundering depot." Especially some unregulated shit that has a history of using dubious tracking  that can easily be the nice and neat "where all that extra money came from."
They were documented repeatedly and handwaved the discrepancies away. "oh, the different price feeds for different users is just an API bug errrr I mean just a lag issue yea!"
A money making exchange on a popular tax haven laundering property with even a 1% spread = laundering potential. There is absolutely no way around that.

Ask why they are insensitive. 
Look at mid 2012, how much bitcoin was in the wild and the valuation of it. 
Now ask yourself, if 50% of all bitcoin in existence was gathered at $0 valuation, do you think someone gives a fuck if 0.005 bitcoin per transaction matters at all? "b-b-but that's $75 at a $15k valuation!"
No, it's not, because theoretically that person who mined/gathered 10,000 bitcoin in 2010-2012 is transferring 0.00005% of their crypto tokens' value per transaction for something as simple as priority.
They do not have the same experience as the person putting $10 a week in and trying to move their holdings between wallets, and never will. But yeah, let it sink in that over 50% of the bitcoin in existence was valued near $0 in mid-2012. It's anyone's guess how much of that 50% has actually been sold or has a higher "valuation" tagged to it. 
I'd love to know the "cost" of each bitcoin in existence. How many bitcoins were actually "bought" or "mined" at a valuation of $10,000 each and never sold to someone at a higher valuation? Now do that for $1k, 100, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01 etc. 
I know for a fact that some of the earliest adopter whales could sell at a volume that could drive the coin price down to $10, if an exchange would "allow" it.
This is why the early whales have so much power, they can make a phonecall to someone looking to buy and do an off-market transaction that has 0 impact on valuation, in high volume.

No it doesn't, at all. The initial title:
US Senate Bill S.1241 to Criminalize Concealed Ownership of Bitcoin
The quote that was editorialized:
“criminalize [those] intentionally concealing ownership or control of a [digital currency or digital exchange] account.”
The uneditorialized quote:
“criminalizes intentionally concealing ownership or control of a bank account.”
Not at all the same.
Digital exchange account, yes. Digital currency account, no. (that doesn't even make sense, wallets aren't "accounts", yet the impetus on these threads is to say that the gov are retards that don't know that, instead of the editorializer making shit up) The implication is "holding on your own wallet" versus "holding on an exchange."
But please, enlighten me why you believe the government should not be allowed to regulate the government's currency? If you don't like it so much, why are you exchanging bitcoin for $$$? As stated in the above quote, if you don't use a KYC/AML exchange, they can't know your holdings.

Ehhh, the reason BCH is price locked at 1/10th of BTC is that that is the advantage that ASICBOOST gives, so with all those miners basically unable to use it anymore since the fork, they aren't losing anything by mining it at lower volumes. There's no financially viable way that they're not 90% bitcoin 10% bcash mining already
 
@_date: 2018-08-20 17:42:16
oh, look, this again.
the answer with bitcoin is ALWAYS "buy now." If you bought bitcoin right now, you are buying in at a point where only 1 year in its ~10 year history was it priced higher than it was now.
All purchases of bitcoin in that 1 year window are losing, all purchases in that 9 year window is winning. 
So you can say the people who bought are the 10% designated to be the bagholders...
...but here's the thing, if you have any awareness of the technology and the potential, what do you think it will be worth. do you think it halvening will have 0 impact on price? do you think hashrate won't just increase as accessibility to mining increases? (internet of things devices with miners built in). what is it for, if you omit "price games / speculation?"

It is obvious that it isn't directly usable as an end-user transaction system for small scale transactions. Changing the software so it chases some short term gain is idiotic.

this makes no sense and shows you have no experience (or basic knowledge) of how open source development works. 
There are vastly more developers on core than on b'cash, or for that matter many of the other successful alts/forks.
The fuck does number of developers have to do with shit? You don't like it, make your own fork and use that. Oh no but then it's "centralized" when 1 out of 1 people have developed it. that's 100% !!!! OH OH !!!!
But don't be mad when the consensus makes their decision.
And especially don't shit in forums that aren't for your fucking "coin of choice." Next are you gonna go over to the ethereum or litecoin forums and bray about how they're not "true crypto?" 
Personally, I'm only centric to r/bitcoin because it was there before the frenzy of alt-coins hit, and nothing I've seen out of any alt has sounded like more than a gimmick that piggybacks on an idea people weren't smart enough to come up with on their own, so it makes me question the necessity of the various distinguishing development choices. 
bitcoin would have been killed off almost a decade ago if it didn't have resilience. Any crypto is, as anyone who has holdings in a dead/nonfunctioning coin can testify to. But it's still there. others are still there. They could all be worth $1 and interchanged, but they are not... and there are good reasons for that. If you don't know them then you could care less about the differentiators and it makes perfect sense why you'd support some shitcoin that offers literally 0.
But please don't tell me it is some proof of value when ASICBOOST % advantages literally equals the price of b'cash relative to bitcoin. it is 100% literal that the bonus power by those bad actors' hardware is diverted to b'cash otherwise it would be unutilized due to segwit. 10% Ta daaah

this is meaningless.
bitcoin's literal valuation is 100% tied to "cost of mining." If I mine something and it cost me $X, then bitcoin is pegged to $X.
Hash rate will decrease when the actual cost of the electricity + hardware updates is higher than what I can sell it for. 
At basically no point in the history of mining, to this day, has mining been more expensive than the yield of bitcoin.

not really, the floor for any crypto is cost to mine.
the literal worst case scenario is that it gets locked to that cost. that cost increases for 120 years.
think of it this way. in the year 2100 each block will reward a tiny fraction of a bitcoin. right now 12.5 is mined every 20 minutes. Between 2100 and 2140 1 bitcoin will be mined total.
think of how expensive it will be to mine that one bitcoin.

crypto can never be dead unless you ban the internet...
so yes, nobody will know if God will fart and extinguish the sun + gamma ray blast all electronics tomorrow either, but we can exist ignorant of those natural disasters.
Do you think the hashrate will increase? It has never decreased
Do you think we'll be alive in 2020? Does it matter if we're not?
Do you think the hashrate will at least be the same as it is now in 2020? If yes, then when the halvening happens that, at a minimum, doubles the cost of mining 1 btc.
So whatever the cost basis is for a miner NOW, it is 2x that in 2020. But, I think it will be much, much more than 2x because the hashrate keeps going up. 
So when you say "purely speculating" you're insinuating that it is guessing. But would you say that given the little bit of knowns or "doesn't matters" we do have, you can make an educated guess? I would!

Not necessarily true. 
In 2009 50btc could be mined every few minutes on CPUs at a total hashrate of 4M hash/s
In 2018 12.5btc is mined every few minutes with asics at 50 terahash/sec
The value of bitcoin is completely tied to the cost it takes to actually mine it at any given point in time. so the difference between 1 and 100 btc is as arbitrary as the ink on the paper.
Now realize that 1/2 of ALL the bitcoin that will ever exist was mined when the valuation was under $50 for 1. So does that make 1/2 of all the bitcoin RIGHT NOW, or FOREVER, worth &lt;$50? Obviously not.
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:34:20
Of course there is. 
The problem is that 1/2 of the bitcoin that was ever in existence was mined at $50. 
As I said, if I mine it at $1,000, I'm not selling it for anything under $1,000. That BTC, to me, is forever tagged as "it's worth $1,000."

Can you imagine a future where the IOT has miners built in by default? Your RGB Dildo has a miner, your mousepad has a miner, etc. 
If every internet connected CPU suddenly was a miner, the hashrate would multiply greatly. and that isn't even considering now putting an asic into whatever devices.

passing fad that's been around for almost 10 years now and has increased 190,000x in value from initial valuations and is now at 60,000x in value? 
I love when people bring up how silly bitcoin is, how "real it isn't." 
Back 9 years ago people were saying "bitcoin is just a rube goldberg machine to convert electricity bills into digital money." Weird how people seemed to have forgotten that, when it is equally true as it was back then (but the wacky device you need to mine it has gotten a lot more expensive).
I don't know Marx's labor theory of value, I know that if you have X number of people mining 1 bitcoin at Y cost, that Y cost is a pretty fucking strong "valuation marker."
But I guess in your viewpoint miners should sell bitcoin for less money than it costs to mine it? Genius!

Unless you are getting some sort of deal on hardware, rent, electricity... mining has always been less profitable than spending the same cash on just buying bitcoin directly. Like 100% of the time in all of btc's history.
In 2011 just replacing your graphics card with a new one if it fried, that three hundred dollars could have been spent on 400 bitcoins. There is no way that single GPU mined 400 bitcoins.
The only way that works is if you got the GPU for free, didn't pay for replacements, didn't pay for infrastructure, don't pay yourself for the time it takes to mine.

because when someone mines a bitcoin it costs them money to do so and they'll sell it a little above that cost to people who don't mine who like the idea of having a store of value that can't be taken away from them or managed by a 3rd party.
Anything more than that is speculation on future value and/or assignment of value based on utility. 
Bitcoin increases in value necessarily as the cost to mine one bitcoin increases. If it costs $100,000 to mine one bitcoin, why would it be worth less than $100,000? And that cost is going to increase as long as the hashrate increases and more miners start mining. This is why people are confident the value can only increase.

Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver Eyes ICO as Token Issuance Protocol Comes to Bitcoin Cash
“They’re probably coming to Bitcoin.com, too. We’ve been thinking about having our own ICO for maybe the games part of the platform; maybe we’ll issue a token and pay dividends or use part of the money… to buy back the tokens on the open market.”
Gosh, this sure sounds like a sidechain that is meant to divert profit to a for-profit entity that positions its key software to its own benefit.
OBVIOUSLY if you have core developers volunteering time to something (and a lot of them, not just a few to make sure the code you're basically stealing works (poorly)) they're going to bleed into the for-profit realm.
I know bitcoin devs who work at IBM and Oracle, who did so 9 years ago. didn't seem to be a problem then.

it's not "making something" that requires subjective valuation: someone has to want your turd.
it's a value store. this only happens when people agree that it's a value store. So you can't just start shitting out 100k turds with gold flecks. But weird, artists do that all the time. 
$277,000 for a photo of a crucifix in piss. 
If I dump $10,000 of electricity + hardware + time into making a bitcoin, that token is $10,000 to me. Others seem to agree to that concept.
So bitcoin bottoms out but never goes lower than the sum of the costs to make that coin. As I said in the OP, 1/2 of all bitcoin (10.5 million) was mined at a price point of under $50. 
Undoubtedly some of that was sold at a higher value, to speculators. Stronger hands write on paper "i bought X bitcoin at Y price" and perhaps set a profit point, and done. Weak hands post memes about why their $15,000 1btc purchase hasn't bought them a lambo yet (when the cost of mining that 1btc was maybe $1-2,000).
So even if you ran out and got your rig all ready, so that you were churning out 1btc per $5,000 spent, you are still competing with miners that can fuck with the market because they mined 500 at $0.10, another 100 at $10, and another 20 at $15,000 when their costs went from near zero to maybe $2,000 per. Easy math to do: do it.

Your analogy fails because wheat's price isn't established by an astrology website, these ETF's prices are largely established by a trivially manipulated website/platform.


"Own risk" is exactly against the purpose of an SEC in the first place. If it was, an SEC wouldn't be needed... one of the three mission statements of the SEC is to protect investors. They deem the ETFs high risk and reject them.
Likewise in your statement an ETF isn't even needed if someone wants to take on the risk they can go straight to those exchanges. The problem is when this risk gets bundled with products that a manager might purchase and be sold as "low risk" when it is actually "extremely high risk." 
And since crypto exchanges are basically unregulated, and some would argue unable to be regulated, it is ripe for exploitation to base an investment on some bullshitty mysql based website that could be flat out making phony volume via off change self/bot trading at 0 cost.

there's no way that bitmain wasn't mining bitcoin and BCH at the ratio that makes use of their otherwise useless asicboosting. the profits from btc mining would more than cover their other bullshit ventures and make those look legit
@_date: 2018-08-13 19:16:39
Why would BCH ever fall under 10% of bitcoin though, when that's the ASICBOOST advantage? Running a miner and configuring it to see that advantage will be a minimum for those setups. ie, they lose nothing by mining btc with using the "boost" for bch. 
and i'd find it very, very surprising if they actually sold off what they claimed to have sold off, and had what they claimed they actually had. they're propped up by early whales who had hundreds of thousands of btc before there even was a valuation... 10.5 million btc were mined at a price point under $50 each. The space was not that expansive at the time. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 17:37:38
It's also an endless graveyard of failed businesses that sold things for less than they cost to make.
The difference is that 1/2 of the "set up" here (10.5 million bitcoin) was mined at a valuation of $50. As soon as that valuation goes to $5,000, that's plenty wiggle room to play around with the price to obscure the actual "cost to mine 1 bitcoin."
But sure, set up a rig and mine 1 bitcoin then sell it for less than that cost. Even in the face of ever increasing difficulty/hashrate? 
I don't mind the doomsday scenarios, but don't let them get in the way of probable reality which is a continuation of the pattern we see. If doomsday hits and suddenly bitcoin sells for less than it costs to mine it (never has in 10 years) then, well, it's doomsday and any rationale is out the window anyway. You'd just see a massive sell off by miners who still profit from 1btc = $51.
Regarding "what someone is willing to pay for it," I don't think that's really relevant in this discussion even though it is completely true, obviously. 
It is only relevant in that "speculation" sense of the valuation being inflated above the cost of mining. IE, it costs X to mine, but X+Y is the profit the miner is getting. Y is +/- what someone is willing to pay for it. Someone cannot be willing to pay less than X for it, they'll never get the coins. 
In this scenario, that's saying, for example, it costs $3,000 to mine a bitcoin. Everything above $3k is speculation pricing. 10k, 15k, 6k... it's all speculation bubble as it doesn't cost that much to mine 1 bitcoin. 
And to sell it above or below $3k is speculation regarding how much it will cost to mine 1 btc. I know zero miners that would liquidate under the cost to mine, and they have almost infinite resource to hold until it equalizes.
And so, if it takes 40 years of mining to mine 1 bitcoin, it would be absurd to think that the valuation at that point isn't going to at least somewhat be pulled towards the cost of mining, which will clearly be a massive, massive multiple of the hashrate now.

OP confused INTRINSIC (belonging naturally; essential.)

They are not the same thing, at all. The intrinsic nature, as opposed to extrinsic, refers to logical ordering. If X then always necessarily Y.
Inherent refers to characteristics that one way or another become necessary.
**So people arguing that "the US Dollar doesn't have inherent value" are wrong. What the US Dollar doesn't have is INTRINSIC value.** 
Of course the US Dollar has inherent value: it has been imbued with value, necessarily, by being the currency of the US. That's why it is money and not merely currency.
It isn't INTRINSIC value, because tomorrow the inherent value of the us dollar could be 0.0001$
The US Dollar has value INHERENTLY, because the gov says so.

yes, your mischaracterization is in stating "longer than 2 weeks."
Difficulty changes based on block discovery: every 2016 blocks, calculated to normalize hashrate and block yielding to 1 block/10 mins. It is calculated so that whatever that hashrate is now would have caused the last 2016 blocks to have taken exactly 2 weeks to mine instead of whatever it took.
One thing to remember is that the difficulty changes every 2 weeks and then  mining typically "accelerates" ... for example this difficulty was a 10% increase over the max difficulty, but hashrate has increased muuuuuch more than 10% since then.
It is also why you see massive dips in hashrate right before the 2016 blocks:
 (july 16, 29)
This is the basis for things like "speculation attacks" which have a newly disinterested (or coerced/incentivized) major mining pool to pull the plug while profiting from the price drop that they're basically precipitating.
If you lowered the recalculation, it just allows for more frequent "gaming" of the difficulty. 
This is another reason why layer2 networks are crucial. big mining cabals having the power to slow down all transactions by plug pulling is a silly concept, but also realize that those pools are not 1 individual, but a collection of individuals who wouldn't necessarily agree with that action and would simply connect to a new pool.

you CAN scale onchain and limit who can participate to huge, for-profit interests.
Are you telling me that if bitcoin hit the volume of visa that everyone is going to have their own 10,000 sqft server farm and tap into the fibre backbone?
So no, the only debate comes from the shills at bcash who've had so little volume they could run nodes off of a 56k modem and floppy drive, with plenty of time to swap discs.
The argument is so vapid it is beyond idiotic: it has been proven repeatedly that taking the effort to refute baseless claims is a vast multiple of work required to making the claims. And they spam the claims over and over again, gosh it must be true!
It is not hard to simulate out and solve this "debate" really quickly. You will never, ever, ever, end up with a cryptocurrency that is completely self contained without transport layers on top of it. Do you think when you get a verification with your bank card it is actually verifying an entire ledger every single time? Of course not, because that would be flat out retarded to the transaction rate of the network.
The entire FUD behind blockstream being a for profit institution/corporation tainting the purity of bitcoin is likewise irrelevant. Of course for profit entities are going to influence the space. Does bcash have a problem with coinbase? LOL.
But to say that they are keeping bitcoin crippled to create profit from sidechains is, again, just ridiculous. It veers the entire discussion away from the point they're wrong about **SCALING IS IMPOSSIBLE WITH ACCESSIBILITY** and towards **"Well they just don't WANT scaling because they want to profit on sidechains!"**
How about this idea: they are getting the jump on the inevitable sidechain revolution because they know that's the future regardless of what they "want" to develop, or not? 
You could make your own sidechain. Anyone could. But most importantly, banks and retail entities will.

It won't. That's the point of stating 50% of the bitcoin in existence was mined at a pricepoint of $50 or less.
That means people are "profiting" if they sell their btc at $50+


I didn't forget that, it's just not relevant to the valuation of 1 btc relative to today's valuation.
For all intents and purposes  valuation will always really be "1 block" mined. 
Today that is 12.5btc + whatever misc fees. 
In 2100 that will be 0.00000042btc + whatever fees. 
Doing the math basically resolves to "cost of mining 1 block" = floor valuation. Looking at the rate of mining right now, you'd agree that rate would increase, and thus the cost to mine a block would increase. 
Put it this way, lets say the cost to mine stays the same. Congrats, that $5k is now for .00000042 + whatever fees. Even if the fees were 100,000x the bounty, that would be $5k for 0.04200042 or $119,046 for 1btc


@_date: 2018-08-09 17:15:05
Let's gather up all the posts where people "got out" at every price point in the entire history of BTC, how they bought in higher than the cost to mine 1btc and then it plummeted back down. Whoops! 
It's a hard lesson to learn, but miners can eat losses for a long time when they pump gains up to 5-20x over the cost it takes to mine 1btc.
So no, nobody competent has ever sold bitcoin for cheaper than it cost to mine it. Weak hands who never understood where the valuation is derived from, emergency failures, overspenders, crystalball bettors... yeah, of course they fuck up.

well if you look at the valuation at every halvening
start: $0
11/28/12: ~$13
07/09/16: ~$660 ... 50x value
2020 ??? 
Any valuation newb needs to understand what legislation is passing in major markets, what major players are entering in, what "cost averaging" miners can do (10.5 million bitcoin were mined before valuation was $50, and only maybe 1/2 as many have been mined since), and what the cost of mining actually is for the major % of the hashrate.
At that point they can have their "crazy graphs with lines" to show interesting numbers. 
But that's never going to impress anyone that could dump all their BTC right now and see 60,000x profit because they bought in at $0.10, no matter who thinks "$6,000 is low"

Now if perhaps you were talking about thefts or some sort of coersion based groups getting a pass because of a free market: "ransomware hackers... why does the free market do this?" that's one thing.
But there ought to be nothing "illegal" about trading or market manipulation, since the only way to manipulate a market is playing off of the idiotic, centralized "rules" of that market. 
IE, when you have a centralized entity like an exchange, THAT'S what you can exploit. All exchanges' valuations are exploitable as a result. THAT is how pumping and dumping can work. 
The free market allows those exchanges to exist because there is enough money behind them that they are supported. When that dries up, the exchanges dry up. Will the "power to the people" be realized before it is realized that 99% of this is a few people with long history or deep pockets?

"95%" 
*CITATION NEEDED*
Also, I hope you're trolling if you think that there are people who haven't opted into crypto because they have cash... huh?
Decentralization of crypto is 100% that someone else doesn't fucking control your currency. It's that simple. It's like having a bank where you can guarantee that they don't do shit with your money, limit your access to it, or disappear. 
"Using cash" is literally the least secure form of money. 
Digital money is coming. Soon there will be NO CASH. Bitcoin / crypto is at least some resistance to whatever governing body being able to flip a switch and now you have no money.
And reviewing your post, it's basically a lot of words for you to say "no." without providing what you believe "the whole point of crypto" is. 
Because OTHER THAN decentralization there is absolutely no benefit to it that has manifest itself yet, unless you're a criminal (to varying degrees of moral bankruptcy). IE, maybe you feel a law is unjust and use bitcoin to circumvent it. Or maybe you're a scumbag doing scumbag things. 
Speed = shit, stability = shit, user friendliness = shit, customer support = haha, insurance = haha, government protection = haha... the one thing is security. 
And noobs, olds, normies, lamestreamers have "problems" with the security, because not everyone has a Mr. Robot tattoo and tinfoil dish to a pirated satellite at burning man for internet which appears to be a requirement to learning how to not get h4x3d uR cRypt0

Kanye is a retard. Liberal dogma? Liberalism? LOL a black dude who made his money off of the streets in Chicago, supporting Trump, is hilarious.

Wow, welcome to the discussion that started in 2009.
And no, spending BTC is not necessarily a taxable event. 
The taxable event is when you are realizing gains from your BTC when you spend it.
If you buy bitcoin at $100 and then spend it when it's worth $99, there is no taxable event.
If you buy bitcoin at $100 and then spend it when it's worth $101, you have realized a 1% profit and that profit is taxable.
this headache was conflated with the "buying coffee" issue because if you buy lots and lots and lots of bitcoin at different times, you have different basis for that profit.
Say you bought 1 btc each at $5.57, $9.18, $2.93, $1000, $39.00, $19,000, $8,000.
Now you buy a cup of coffee for 2.4 btc. Are you going to use LIFO? FIFO basis? You would have to then do the calculations for each price basis and consider those prices when calculating your gains and figuring out how much tax you owe.
Now compound that greatly, and a lot of people were stung on this, if you traded thousands of times on an exchange at thousands of prices... there are apps to calculate those bases but, yeah, it's a layer of inaccessibility for the common person but no big deal for any seasoned trader.
Flip it in reverse, if you get out and accrue capital losses, I'm sure you're going to document that well to squeeze as much benefit out of the losses, right?

Yes, it is 7.5% much better. 
And no idea why you're using numbers that add up to near 50% to prove some FUD point you're trying to make. All that is relevant is what ONE ENTITY'S % is. ~20.75% being one entity is not alarming.
@_date: 2018-08-09 17:00:56
the better technology will be something that utilizes bitcoin as a transport layer. 
blockchains are fine to start up, from zero. but they will never have the resilience that bitcoin's blockchain has. and so if you have BTC, it is more likely that the "better technology" will be a continuation or fork utilizing the current ledger than something entirely new.
Of course, governments and big banks have ways of enforcing that "something new" will be used. So why would you want to live on the planet when the "better technology" is the property of a centralized force? 
@_date: 2018-05-25 15:49:25

I'd rather post in a moderated subreddit than one that is a fraud subreddit that plays internet con artist games for positioning.
Oh gosh, so you can say anything you want in a subreddit named after a different coin that basically had all of its shitposters/shills kicked out because they were flooding the forum with their own horseshit opinions and then claiming "censorship"? I mean, I would fully expect a ban if I posted even 1/10th of the nonsense and volume they did, and violated reddit TOS by using sock puppets, brigades and vote manipulation.
And the SAME FUCKING THING would happen if anyone bothered doing the same at r/btc ... except, weird, noone is bothering because it is irrelevant. Oh well!
Sorry, it isn't censorship when you have 100s of sock puppets literally spamming the forums while they know mods are opposing your viewpoint as bait. 
So here were the two choices: delete the spam, ban the spammers. Or keep the spam and the spammers win by making the communication platform uselessly obfuscated/noisy.
So instead of having bitcoin_uncensored and btc, you'd have bitcoin_unspammed and xbt or whatever, where people would take refuge. Instead we don't need to take refuge because our forums are intact. Strange! But yeah I'd love to see any of the b'cash crowd show their face in a real crypto info stream, and not their own channels. Let's hear some of that theorycraft on a variety of listservs or forums that would laugh the ideas, oh, i dunno, back to reddit?
So really all this is about is a "fuck you, you can't kick me out of MY house" big dick waving contest by early whales who've been "officially ostracized."
Note, none of those r/btc assholes are in the IRCs and other forums where censorship was not an issue: they were ostracized by the community for proving to be insufferable.
So sure, one can make their own playpen and play with all their own toys. buuuuut they still smell like shit and that's why nobody wants to play with them :)

Actually, that's exactly what it means. The one without changes TO THE CONSENSUS is the "original bitcoin." Those with changes are forks. Do you even understand that one of them CHANGED THE CONSENSUS RULES?
It is as absurd as growing a cock on your forehead and claiming that your asshole is actually your mouth, while walking on your hands.


From your description, it's clear that you don't even really understand what happened and have zero awareness of the people behind the forking. Do you think it is some sort of grand coincidence that a massive boatload of b'cash exists from the Gox shit, and Ver lived across the street from Gox? That's literally free money for doing a shitball fork and pumping it with early adopter whale / mining cabal resources. Just a big coincidence that Karpeles is CTO of a company now (CTO... when he literally fucked a website into the ground? LOL. I wouldn't hire him to organize a fucking HTML file) that Ver is associated with via board politics? Mmmmmmm hmmmmmm.


No, it isn't.
And you're omitting where being "pro BCH" is just mindlessly parrotting this bullshit over and over and over again. Just stating things tritely and expecting well-measured discourse EVERY. FUCKING. TIME. IT. IS. POSTED.
These discussions were had, the opinions are pretty clear.
Please, point to where EDA and bigger blocks are "philosophically more pure/correct?" Neither of them are directly referenced, especially not EDA. And both Hal + Satoshi, as well as Nick were always discussing layer2 as the natural extension... yet there is massive toxicity and false dichotomy about how layer2 is "bad" and "more centralized." (Ironic coming from the proponents of a coin that is essentially pure centralization).
It's fucking boring at this point, and no hearts and minds EXCEPT FOR THE GULLIBLE AND/OR INEXPERIENCED are being won over. Literally these posts are attempts at muddying and poaching the curious, to have a faux controversy. 
THAT'S why this shilling bullshit has been ousted. Do you even know why reddit, the .com and twitter are the havens? Why even started? Why they are literally squatting on the name **AND WERE SQUATTING ON THE NAMES BEFORE THERE WAS EVEN A FORK IN EXISTENCE**
You've got the order all mixed up. You think they developed a fork with these ideas years ago, and then figured out the media strategy? LOL all of the sites CAME FIRST. 
There is so much wrong with b'cash, the bottomline is that it does less fucking volume than a few memecoins and only does that volume due to shilling, deceit and sockpuppetry. 
Why do you not bring up the OTHER altcoins/implementation that FAILED? All with "bitcoin" in the name? By the same people?

Do you see the ridiculous error in your shitty parallelism? That

That's classic con-man false association.
And last time I checked, nobody is trying to fucking impersonate b'cash. Hmmm! You can't make a fork, move in on the name space and then also claim that the original is copying you. Nobody intelligent will bother, that leaves your userbase the gullible/ignorant who clearly think they "missed out" on bitcoin. Perfect for scamming with all the pumping and dumping
And the fact that it has basically stalled and locked into  1/10th of whatever btc is worth is a huge marker. there is no independent valuation of it, and the only people who bother mining it are those who were ASICBOOSTING and so aren't "missing" the hash. Weird! it's almost like they had a 10% advantage previously and can use all that disabled power on their shitcoin mining! Weird coincidence!
It's a pathetic coin that has 0 innovation and can only follow bitcoin around like a fucking obsessed troll.

Never mind the fact that both share the exact same genesis... that's too easy.

The problem with this chain of logic is that 1/2 of bitcoin was mined at or before $50, and there's really no way of knowing if the bitcoin you're purchasing was mined at $50, or mined at $15,000. Or at a cost of $1, $0, or $5-6,000.
Otherwise I agree fully with your post, it is a more precise version of what I was oversimplifying to give people some light in the darkness of "why price?"
All bitcoin is valuated at, and the market cap is calculated at, volumes based on the current price.
The current price is really just a speculation unless it is in lockstep with current mining costs (plus a little profit). That upward pressure is largely from mid-sized operations that don't have perks of free electricity or hardware premiums, those are still "most miners" even though the largest players have formed their conglomerates.

the visitor measurement is suspicious since that page has an additional link that would potentially inflate visitor numbers depending on tracking methodology.

The number of visitors who donate zero and actual page views through out the donation funnel would clarify this.

Huh? Nothing above confuses intrinsic and extrinsic, and your example is pointless in that it draws parallels between all currency having int/ext value correctly.
the "intrinsic value in their ability to pay transaction fees to miners" is reaching, since you can (could) have 0 fee transactions so that is not "intrinsic."
But the logic still holds, the US gov will accept US Dollars, so that's worth something.

If it also isn't the best currency to sell, then who would sell it to all these buyers?
Answer: miners and whales who have so much bitcoin it doesn't matter if they sell a big % off, they're seeing thousands of % returns.
So basically you have miners covering FIAT costs by selling coins to people who then hoard them, and the people at the tip of the pyramid "cashing out" to lesser fools.
But yes, bitcoin is the best to buy... one day I (cannot legally) promise you will either be able to use it fluidly or convert that purchase today into many lamborghinii tomorrow.

The problem here is that I would willingly donate lower amounts of bitcoin... I might throw $0.25 of bitcoin out there while I'd never do $0.25 via a credit card.
This mindset is completely opposite. The interesting stats are left out...
1. how many visitors to each page donated nothing
2. what was the average donation via bitcoin
3. what was the average donation via credit card
All it takes is someone who is directly interested in bitcoin failing to make a whale donation via credit card to skew these numbers. Tinfoil hat securely on, of course, but that possibility of skewing stats to prove a failure versus push a success is easily slanted towards keeping things the same, right?
Also, it is assholish to think that someone would "only donate" if it was bitcoin. Just as it is assholish to think if there is the ability to do it it lessens donations, which appears to be the conclusion here.
Frustrating because it is spoken about with some regard as to how it was handled but a bit flippant in the implementation as actually good?
@_date: 2014-12-08 23:55:45
Revenue per VISITOR went down. Total revenue went up.
**Question** with revenue are you considering transaction costs? Are you considering that people paying with a credit card accrue fees and charges that do not exist with bitcoin? Or are you skipping all that in your calculations. How many fees and charges are you OK with handing to for-profit companies just to enable people to give philanthropically? 
Using your words "it's a small amount but it adds up."
How are the stats for "revenue per person who donated?"
How are the stats for "without a bitcoin button increasing the # of users while lowering their average donation we would have actually made less money?" I'd like to see that assertion addressed.
**Most importantly** how are the stats for increasing your donations over the next 20 years because you were an (early?) adopter of bitcoin? No faith in that when it comes down to the brass tacks...
The faulty assumption here, and the flaw of "A/B testing" is that by removing the button you would have increased your donations 7.5% You can never know that.
Just like you can never know how many donations you're going to lose because you took down the bitcoin button.
I'm not going to delve into the poor placement of the link (why is this not an option at step 2? You've created a disjointed user experience map) or your methodologies of determining what a visitor is (what happens when someone clicks the link out of curiosity and then returns to the page? What are you tracking to determine they're "a visitor" and not "2 visitors?"). The price points seem silly as well. Making people type cheaper amounts? 
Never mind your ridiculous requirements of demographic / data gathering on a donor using bitcoin. Derp. email address and personal info. Talk about missing the point.

Do you not understand that all they've proven is that adding a bitcoin link in the manner that they choose to implement it is only part of the difference? And at best they've A/B proven that this way is "worse." That has nothing to do with the utility of bitcoin or its value, or what they could have done. Maybe with A/B/C and a non-shitty implementation, C would have been +10% .... they won't know, right?
This is like saying if you add a line to the McDonald's menu offering some other choice, less people eat at mcdonalds. Because they A/B tested it and that's what happened! It is the same mythology that google ads test(ed) A/B/C..../ZZZZZZ on simply the color of the link. Oh, this particular color of link increased ad clicks, it is clearly the best one! THAT makes sense.
Simple A/B completely ignores the iterative nature of design. Why not A/B/C/D/E with 5 different placements and treatments? Why not one with a bright orange bitcoin text link versus one with a graphical link versus one with no mention until you actually pay. I don't see a visa link at the bottom to pay with visa yet somehow visa donations are the benchmark! Because that's what "most people do."
So now they can test what would happen if it was actually decently integrated in the payment process, or if the pages with a bitcoin giving button had $1 or $0.50 price points, or if they didn't add a distraction at the CHOICE POINT in their step process. 
Their entire methodology is based on antiquated "how to psychologically sell philanthropic giving" I'm surprised they didn't remove the dollar signs and make the donations similar to 19.99. Because you know that makes people not think they're using money and that they're gaining value. Because A/B.
So if there is "angst" here it is because the methods seem both dismissive and incomplete while trying to claim "they earnestly tried to use it."
This, to me, looks like marginalizing it to mitigate risk. Which is fair. But don't then post about how it is not worth doing because you tried to implement it in an oddly diminished manner.
And really, if less people donate because there's more options. There's a point where you say "fuck them." In the long run you don't end up with less donations or less users, you end up with more intelligent, supporting users.
Just like mozilla fought a battle against the IEs of the world "we need to support this garbage system that an uneducated user is too lazy to change." If it weren't for the developers of the world saying "you know what, fuck IE support" the traction wouldn't have been there. But they were supported. 
So it is a bit raunchy to see this turn of events... almost seems "off mission" in order to support the CFO visioning. Shrug, not exactly uncommon in the non-profit world. not even hypocritical. Money and mission are best friends and worst enemies.

You can't really "break even" with any butterfly labs product because the amount of fiat you spent to buy the thing could have been used to just buy bitcoins instead. That was the scam: they used the $$$ to make the miners to mine until it was no longer profitable to do so at that rate and then ship them out.
You could have easily mined enough to recoup the fiat. My jalapeno was early but not too early and it only took about a month of mining to recoup the fiat. Never mind what that value might be in X years from now on the moon. 
But it is physically impossible that any # of BFL products were used to actually beat just buying bitcoins at that $ value. 
the only argument against that is if you didn't really have the means to purchase bitcoins. Avoiding the risk of mtgox and other doomed places just to potentially buy bitcoins is a good thing and was a very, very real risk of losing out.

You're telling me that, say, filling up a webpage with functionality via externally loaded scripts versus having the page load quickly isn't a compromise?
Obviously you want "both" but you cannot have them. The right answer isn't just averaging them, because user experience is qualitative, not quantitative. That correct answer is a compromise between functionality and speed while preserving the highest profitability (a third, functionally related category).

If they don't, that's when you see people saying "no credit cards unless you pass the minimum transaction."
So the "coffee fee" problem is out the window anyway.
The problem with comparing bitcoin to credit is that prices everywhere in the world are set by the cost of credit.
so if you pay the same amount, but with bitcoins, part of that is paying for the credit. if you removed that cost, then added in bitcoin transaction fee: gasp, it'd be less.

Bitcoin is working as intended. Market forces will dictate what version is used, why it is used, and who uses it. Natural sides are drawn to try and urge things one way or the other but the system finds equilibrium.
If the next step of equilibrium is miners being strictly interested in fees (they're not at all, that's a dumb misconception) and that lowering the value of bitcoin as a result, it will shake out weak hands hodling  and mining no longer.

Testimony is not equal to decrypting a hard drive. Case in point, they wouldn't have ANY REASON to plead the 5th if it exonerated them. Thus it does not exonerate them, it simply must mean guilt as this is evidence and not merely testimony. 
This is a crucial distinction between being compelled to testify against yourself versus being forced to turn over evidence.
Replace "encrypted hard drive" with "sealed garbage bag." You are literally claiming that law enforcement do not have the right to open up a sealed garbage bag? Even with a warrant? Seems silly right. But what if the garbage bag, once so easily opened, is now only openable by the owner's willingness? 
There is no fucking way that the "willingness of cooperation" by someone who has had a search warrant executed on them should be relevant.
When the cops bust into your house with a warrant they have the RIGHT to SEARCH AND SIEZE everything. Encryption is unacceptable as "no, you can't search this place." That privacy in this situation is clearly irrelevant, and an impeding force to justice. It will never, ever cause justice moreso than simply revealing the contents. Are you saying that by keeping the drives decrypted you are preserving innocence? Because the only two results are either guilty because there is CP on the drive or innocent because there is no CP on the drive. If you say "I'm not going to show you what's on the drive." Well guess what that means?
Even if the warrant is based on specific evidence of downloads, when they find OTHER evidence, it doesn't matter. You don't "not get in trouble" for having illegal guns when the cops kick your door down to execute a cocaine search and seizure.
Hard drive encryption is literally "impenetrable."
This is not the same as "we know you killed the person, so tell us where you buried the body." This is why the 5th exists.
This is also not the same as "we know you killed the person, so tell us the combination to the safe you stored their head in." Because the safe would be "breakable."
This is a unique case and the bill of rights NEVER saw this shit coming. We need laws clearly defined about how decryption is handled (and I feel the 5th amendment is not relevant to intentionally witholding evidence).
What is ACTUALLY unacceptable here is that someone remains in limbo because the legal system hasn't seen this before. It'd be one thing if limbo meant they walked free. Instead they're incarcerated. Without being charged, without being found guilty of anything. The leverage the government has over us because they can take time away with "no crime" is ridiculous. 
The reason why TPTB won't clarify the goddamn rules is because they benefit from the encryption and so cannot state that others aren't allowed to.

Well, if one person could cause all this then bitcoin isn't as resilient as we think. I don't think it is pinnable on one person.
In fact I think this should be an opportunity to essentially prove bitcoin's value and worth. Hard forking is always a threat, always a possibility. It would have happened immediately, if it was immediately obviously a "good thing." But they won't do it because, essentially, they know they're milking profits for an inevitable long term adherence to what is known as "core."
Never mind that if (when) BU goes away due to being philosophically different, that will only prove how much more valuable BTC is.
There is no scenario where a split occurs and BU "reigns supreme." It just will not happen. All of the threats, all of the obvious marketing scams around "confusion" will not change the fact that basically everyone is supporting core now.
You could make a "fuck everyone" fork and include whatever features you'd like. They'd be the best features that everyone wants, right!? But then when your fork dwindles down to nothing because of, oops, no support... even if it is the superior choice tech-wise, you'll just be devoured back into the main chain.
There is a reason why there aren't 100 bitcoin variations that are all similar to or using the chain but with new bells and whistles. Before you pin this phenomenon on one person, learn why.

I'm not following: isn't it a baseline functionality of bitcoin that "users of Bitcoin are forced into a bidding war to get their transactions into the next block?"
As in, that's how it's always worked?
Also, I thought was the anti-segwit bunch, yet they're claiming is?
Reading deeper you find that they are making a sort of faux-resistance: they want MORE THAN segwit therefore segwit itself is bad. It's a tactic to actually be in agreement but setting up an us vs. them false dichotomy. Look at the US + Obamacare, and how there are plenty of republican jurisdictions that thrive under it (but rename it to something else, looking at you kentucky) and the people "love it" which is why it can't go away so easily.
It is all about personal agendas being obscured in abstract philosophizing over what might be better in the long run vs. the short term, perma-fixes vs. patches / hacks, etc. Doing that via a gameable, agenda moderated forum is never going to yield truth so much as favor agenda.

I'm missing what your point is?
You're claiming that many people mine so it is an individual effort, when those "many people mining" are obviously part of POOLS that are CONTROLLED BY VERY FEW.
If you take that back a step, the masses of individual miners DO NOT ADD UP to those who have created mining farms. I'm not going to name names, but individuals have direct control over huge chunks of the total hashrate. 
That said, the context of this is "it's your vote" when it does not work that way, at all. It is not a vote. The bad analogy of "millions of other people vote so why bother" is not relevant, it's more like "1 person covers millions of 'votes' and there are way less than millions of us, so why bother."
Were nowhere near a tipping point, and if all of the people who've ever read these forums created their own node it wouldn't mean shit.

It's a juvenile argument. It isn't merely "I have nothing to hide so I don't care," it's at some point digital crime cannot be protected by encryption. That's that, and no privacy argument will ever defend against it.
In the case of child porn I'd say the people who investigate this should easily have the right to decrypt a drive without it considered a "grand abuse of human rights."
I personally do not believe anyone should have the right to an encrypted hard drive, and that does not conflict with the 5th amendment, when they are under investigation / detained / etc for child pornography. 
I think the argument that if we make a law that says IN THE CASE OF CHILD PORN this is OK, it is some sort of "erosion of human rights" is fucking ridiculous and shows how narrow-minded the pro-privacy folks are.
100% of this is hinging on the idea that justice isn't corrupt, that TPTB don't use this to get at your inventions or steal data. If you start assuming it is, there are other larger problems...

That's a silly bit of circular logic. Obviously that act doesn't make you a criminal but when the only two options are:
1. decrypt drive to reveal kiddy porn (either the referred to or not files)
2. decrypt drive to reveal no kiddy porn
We know the answer.
People don't really have much of a grasp of law if they think something "wrong" is happening here:
Here is the 5th amendment that is getting horribly misrepresented in this thread:
No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.
There is a MASSIVE difference between someone testifying and the testimony being used to characterize them and giving up the password to an encrypted drive. One of them is open to interpretation, the other obviously isn't. 
This isn't asking him "did he do it," this isn't asking him to give his side of the story, this isn't asking him to be a witness. 
This is a literal boolean.
My biggest problem with the encryption issue is that I would have 0 trust in the system not planting or "winning easily" once they had possession of your hard drive and can do whatever they want with it. They have incentive to do so. 
But given 100% trust in the legal system, I think the laws should be updated to disinclude cryptography as an untouchable evidence locker.

It isn't valid because when you have a warrant served on you it includes the content that you're holding out on. No other mechanism in the universe, that I'm aware of, has this same effect. 
It shouldn't be considered testimony to "unimpede" the serving of a warrant / or cease obstructing justice. 
Case in point, they don't need his testimony, referring to a password / key / whatever as testimony is ridiculous.

The slippery slope is fine, but please tell me exactly what is to be gained out of decrypting drives for a government except for intelligence / evidence?
If you have nothing incriminating, they gain nothing.
Are you asserting that they steal it, or use it for their own purposes?
People in this thread seem to believe that the contents of your hard drive are a form of testimony (lol wut) and not merely evidence. 
The list of targets . docx for whatever crime you're going to commit is not testimony.
If you believe the seizure of the device was valid (you don't seem to think it ever is?) then there isn't a problem. If you think the seizure of the device was invalid, then that's the problem you should be focusing on.
In an ideal world cryptography has zero to do with protecting yourself from a lying government trying to get you to admit guilt. 
In other words: looking at an unencrypted hard-drive isn't protected by the 5th, yet its allowed by seizures. The act of telling someone the combination to the safe where you put the body is NOT an issue because the safe is breakable. But as soon as it becomes unbreakable it is subject to privacy laws? Nope.

The rights you're clinging to are outdated and not relevant to the digital age. 
It is one thing to use encryption as a tool to prevent prying eyes from seeing private things, it's a completely different thing when those eyes are conducting a criminal investigation and your encryption is hiding evidence that is only admissible based on your willingness.
So what rights are you protecting? That when you're on trial for pedophilia you have the right to hide child pornography on an encrypted drive because revealing the contents of the drive would prove you're guilty? Because the only other outcome of revealing the drive is, get this, that you don't have any.
I mean why stop there if you think that's so evil of law enforcement and justice, they could easily fake the logs + plant the pornography. "Oh he slipped up and we caught some files unencrypted! haha silly!"

Bad quote. Bad premise. Billions isn't real or even feasible with the technologies you've outlined.
You're also drawing a false parallel + dichotomy. WHY NOT DO ONE IN THE SHORT TERM AND THEN ONE IN THE LONG TERM? WHY NOT BOTH?
The reason is because greedy miners are the reality of the short term. They're not the "voice of the people," they're in fact the examples of centralized force. I can never "have a vote" because people have their vote gangs. And I'm not saying any of these negatively: this is perfectly natural + a pure effect of the system.
So anyway, this is useless antagonism and dichotomy drawing when there is none until it forks. The only reason these are two different "schools of thought" is because people are willfully claiming it is all or nothing instead of making smaller, incremental upgrades.
The reason for this is self-serving. Anyone essentially setting this up as choice A or choice B instead of "choice A then choice B" is buying into the same idea

Sometimes discussions just need a good "hey shut the fuck up idiot" so that we can stop these tangential threads rather than pretend that anything anyone says is worthy of scrutiny. 
But, I'll bite:


That wasn't the original claim. The original claim is that the person who invented the system was not familiar with the whitepaper that directly cites them.


But you would expect Ford to know how marketing generally works, or Gates knows how operating systems' required ubiquity leads to other opportunities regarding hardware and bundling, right? Make an apples to apples argument.
You are claiming that someone who built a predecessor wouldn't know how future versions of it specifically function. This is pointless. The point is that they obviously would have special insight towards how they generally function in an ecosystem where they've actually, you know, seen how their invention has been transformed or utilized.
Further, while I would not expect that Bill Gates or Ford has directly specific knowledge of how some future version works, I would definitely expect them to be able to understand the changes and why they were or were not actually necessary from a business or production standpoint.
Your statement is not apples to apples simple because **Bitcoin is not a mystery, it is not proprietary**. Your examples involve technology that you would not "know" unless you had access to specific information that is not necessarily public. Ford could not dismantle a computerized car and "know" about it without some sort of technical spec, for example.
I'm fairly certain Adam Back has paid more if not the same amount of attention to it, as none of it is secret or proprietary, than 99.99999% of the world and probably the vast majority of people in these forums, and it is literally fucking idiotic to assert otherwise. So "hey shut the fuck up idiot."

[Reading the actual patent]( it's hilarious. they actually have patented "using machine learning to learn shit." HERRRRP DERRRRP.


Are they literally patenting VARIABLES and DATABASE ENTRIES? This is a whole lot of bullshit, and the hilarious thing is that there aren't enough variables to actually make machine learning useful in this situation. 
If you know variables X, Y, and Z at a certain value = "BaD AcCoUnT" that's a fucking SQL lookup.
How do they determine what a bad account is, in the first place, if you follow KYC? 
- level of due diligence (wtf does this even mean)
- age of account (useless)
- geography (meaningless unless tied to specific proof of lawbreaking)
- number of devices (meaningless)
- volume of transactions (meaningless)
- balance (??? fuck you)
- previous compliance reviews (that's your problem, ie, your shit system flagged it before who's fault is that)
- transaction maximum based on transactions (why is that any of your fucking business, afraid someone's trying to structure? there would be no "structuring" if laws didn't invent it as a vector of suspicion)
- changes to personal details (if you move, who gives a shit)
Basically, all this boils down to is drafting HORSESHIT HEURISTICS that "prove suspicion." Except it's circular logic: if your parameters are self-serving, all you're doing is setting up rules to prove that you set up ... parameters?
I dunno, the fact that this adds up to AUTOMATED SHUTDOWN shows how stupid it is. The time-save (assuming decent customer support, LOL) would be in fast tracking "good" accounts and you'd just minimize the amount of manual review.
But that's not the point of this, this just proves (from the fast tracked regulatory approvals that came out of nowhere, to the staff, to the history of disruption and bullshit adherence) that coinbase is a government "no we're a private entity" player.
The future of bitcoin to fiat will be this level of scrutiny. The hilarious thing is that it only triggers AFTER you've given up the bitcoin, meaning the gov claims a valueless token from you to redistribute as it sees fit, while stating "you are bad so you get nothing back."
i wouldn't be surprised if coinbase simply becomes a pathway for wall street via Know Your Customer being so shitty you'd be stupid to not do it through a 3rd party that controls your coins. Wamp wamp.
It's extremely irritating that they're couching this into "fighting illegal activity" rather than what it actually is:
 themselves as the judge regarding what is or is not allowed bitcoin usage
To be or use coinbase is to comply with US Gov (if they're not just a front for gov ops anyway), so it isn't unexpected.

No they don't, it's an additional layer of customer service with 0 upside. The best case scenario is that it is "no different than debit/credit," the worst case scenario is that they have added another vendor to take credit that they have to rely on. It's the same reason why every online vendor doesn't accept every single type of credit card. Why not, it just opens more channels, eh?

“double taxation is illegal?”
in almost every country that taxes people you are taxed multiple times on every bit of commerce.
income tax and sales tax, then general taxation on type of goods. those goods are taxed on the other end from production to distribution which inflates end cost.
you telling me if you purchase a monetary instrument and it doubles in value, you don’t pay taxes on those gains? LOL what country is this?
besides the number of taxations doesn’t even fucking matter if the amount is the same.
having 100 and paying 50 in tax once income tax is no diff than having 100, paying 30 for income, 10 for entertainment tax, 10 for sales tax.

it can.
should it? 
depends on if you believe normalization of bitcoin necessarily has an impact on the valuation. Seeing how the price takes a shit whenever someone moves a relatively large amount all at once, and how trivial it is for someone to do that, I'd guess that more jobs in the sector means more adoption + that is a positive impact on future valuation.

Commodities exchanges, stock exchanges, brokerages. 
I know someone who buys and sells trains full of recycled paper. They don't bring the trains to the fucking store to pay for things, but guess what, they're worth money.
The point is, DIGITAL FIAT doesn't need to be "bank controlled" when we've proven that a blockchain can do it all for free/automatically. 
At that point, USD_DIGITAL is no different than BITCOIN, all that's needed is any sort of agreement mechanism to swap. Trivial implementation.
For example, there are plenty of digital only payment systems like Zelle, Paypal, Venmo, Cash... all that has to happen is anyone's address is linked to a key, and now you can freely exchange between those ledgers (if they were blockchains) and bitcoin.
why, then, are those companies needed? issuance can be done automatically.
Every single credit card or digital payment platform could simply open up an API and tie everything together. The fact that it hasn't happened yet is more telling than the action itself. 
Cash app is the closest thing to this.

when people say ponzi they mean pyramid.
the entire premise that you’re ignoring is that all currency is a pyramid (as well as a ponzi if you generalize enough) due to physical impossibility to distribute fairly
- the central issuer was the developer and cohorts that essentially premined trivially
- bagholders post FOMO bullshit to cash out, everyone screams HODL but in order to obtain BTC someone is selling 
- prices have been fixed by transaction fees strongarmed into place by the upper echelons of commerce as fixed via gov fees
- bitcoins price valuation is manipulated by whales, nothing to do with supply and demand (the idea is that bitcoin IS the business in the ponzi metaphor)
- bitcoin’s intrinsic value has nothing to do with the mechanics of it’s position
@_date: 2019-03-03 04:31:32
How are any of them any different? You either comply with US KYC law or you don't, if you don't then you're not relevant to legally "get fiat for crypto" because you open yourself up to bank shutdowns for violating that law.
That's my valuation of "best." 
That varies for non USA, whatever. But I've failed to see one with as much reach and validity as Coinbase. What, BISQ with Cash App? No different.
So yes, believe it or not but the future of mass adoption will be with legally abiding users. If you politically disagree with that level of compliance, great! But it's irrelevant to that particular service and the reliability and legality of it.

...what you're describing is what already exists, except you're putting them into a stupid "tiering" system without explaining what the tiers mean. typically that has to do with a ranking, what is the ranking?


Please explain to me why you wouldn't be able to provide identification and proof of ownership of an address to a bank? In other words: no, wrong.
It would be trivial to create an app that authenticates a person's face, their location, their information + details with every single crypto transaction... so, uh... there goes your entire point?
Any bank could easily register a customer's information with an address, and everything out of and into that address could be the responsibility of the customer regarding auditing. It would be so trivial to require the logs (the app could just keep them) of every transaction into and out of an address.


Huh? This doesn't make sense at all. What is a "no-kyc p2p exchange" that deals with fiat? please let me know how that works without involving a "very-kyc" bank?

They're correct. 
"Money is energy" is basically meaningless because there are different methodologies to produce the same amount of energy over different periods of time. And so, they are VALUED differently because they require different amounts of maintenance and infrastructure. 
In other words, you can generate some amount of energy by pedaling a stationary bicycle, but that will only generate at some small rate, and gobble up resources to be able to do it at some expense (food).
Versus, you have a trivial costing supply of power and can generate the same amount of energy cheaper and faster with, perhaps, a slightly different up front cost.
Energy here is the constant. According to you money = that energy, when clearly that is a variable.
In the real world the bicycle energy is VALUATED by all costs that go into creating that energy, as an inefficient waste of resources. Solution 2 is better and that becomes the value of energy. The same energy has two different values, but we ignore the inefficient one for the overall valuation.
I think the discussion is taking the euphemism "money is power" a bit literally, where the term is really more about influence and opportunity and not a literal power = energy output ...

The point made was just that coinbase users &gt; total bitcoin in existence.
what the fuck does that have to do with reserves? Nothing, that's what. spyote isn't right. There was no implication. 
all it means is (total bitcoin held by all coinbase user)/(total coinbase users) &lt; 1 
(the reality here is total bitcoin held by ANY coinbase user = 0... COINBASE is the one holding the coins, if they are)
It says nothing if that user is KYC confirmed, what levels they are, are they unique individuals, etc. I could create 10 coinbase accounts right now, why would I? Does it have to do with business API? Who knows.
The bottomline is that each user on coinbase, on average, has less than 1 bitcoin. In some l33td00d IRC channel full of cryptoanarchists that average might be 100.

Quick question: What was the biggest marketplace for bitcoin so far?
I'd love to see some stats on how big the various bitcoin accepting vendors pulled.
But until then, I'm just going to go on assuming it was Silk Road and Alphabay.
Now, banks laundering drug money is big... but is it "entire GDP of the top few major countries" big?
Because depending on what % of bitcoin "commerce" was people doing illegal shit (untraceable crime payments, buying drugs, political funding) versus legal shit (gyft, reddit gold, overstock, newegg, steam) we can then actually toss around less hyperbole and more fact.

the point is that KYC allows companies to blame whatever horseshit on KYC / "risk assessment" and there's nothing you can do about it.

except it’s ignoring that the most energy effective (and profitable) solution would have been buying bitcoin and not mining it.
Spending a couple thousand dollar investment just to save mining costs by 75% 50% of a day will never recoup.
That isn’t the point of doing this, so referring to it as cost effectivity is silly.
for example: someone lost money on miners via just spending the money on btc directly but didn’t support centralization (just one example) by paying cartels

It's funny how everyone in this thread got OP's question wrong.


This means "what is to stop 21,000,000 btc from becoming 210,000,000btc"
Because obviously "adding an additional decimal point" is nonsensical, they mean moving the decimal point over to create more btc.
And the answer to that is: nothing stops anyone from doing it. You could create NEWDECIMALBITCOIN and fork all the existing chain where the only functional difference is the different ceiling amount.
But who is going to adopt it? And then when the value plummets with nobody wanting to buy any, who is going to mine it when they would use the exact same resources on any more valuable crypto?
So that's the natural greed of the miner which basically supports the "biggest consensus."
Anyone can make any new version of bitcoin at any time. Good luck actually having people adopt + use it. The only one who's pulled that off with any sort of value was one of the oldest bitcoin whales that has roots with many early .. ahem .. business opportunities of varying degrees of repute. So if you have tens of thousands of bitcoin to blow, sure, start your own coin and prop up its value with bots + horseshit

Most of the fucking inventors were young boomers/ old Gen-X, so yes. You can see this trivially by seeing who the major public whales are, who the known collaborators are via the listserv, IRC and the dev pool themselves.
This isn't an opinion, it's you not knowing shit about it. Look at who invented and nutured all of the major crypto tools, all of the early prototypes, the early pools. the whales. They're not millennials.
And according to your utterly retarded logic nothing was invented until millennials came along, because "older people lol."
In OBVIOUS fact, understanding crypto in any substantial professional or advanced capacity in 2005-2010 would mean you are most likely to be gen-x, never mind having the funds to capitalize on it.
100% of the early adopters I know of, we're talking holders of 10,000+ bitcoin, are either young boomers or old gen-x.
I thought the argument of the useless millennial was that they are disenfranchised? So now they have capital to blow on developing crypto? LOL OK

At that point when do you stop? When is Generation_\# really not to blame it's Generation_\ fault? And so on.
The hilarious thing is nobody will blame millennials for anything except being a useless, poor generation of whiners who were so dominated by their young boomer / old gen-x parents they were basically irrelevant.

Only if you're in the fantasyland that bitcoin stands on its own and won't be compared to a relatively more stable currency.
The "value of bitcoin" could do whatever, that conversion of coin to USD easily solves the problem. 
If yesterday your motherboard was $100 which was 1 bitcoin, but today it is $100 which is 0.1 bitcoin, you get the refund of .1 bitcoin. Not 1.
We'll know we've made it to the moon and have our own broccoli farm there when this is not an issue.

no, because if you just spent the cash on bitcoin directly, you'd make more.
everyone who has ever mined knows this: it lives and dies by how you are paying for the hardware + electricity, and how you can reuse the heat.
Especially now that the price has been flatlined, that's keyed directly to a "cost to generate" and the arms race is from those who can price things down to shake off the hobbyists "break evens" or "lose some but still get neato bitcoin without relying on anyone else."
If you spent every penny you ever spent on mining directly on BTC you would have far more BTC. There are very few cases where that's not true

It isn't "on me" to prove a fucking thing, right now bitcoin is doing a great job of proving it for us. 
It is easily dismissable when you discuss 128MB blocks, as it is so mindblowingly ignorant of WHY THERE AREN'T BLOCKS THAT LARGE ALREADY that it shows where your thought process is.
I'll play along: were you around when bitcoin used 36MB blocks? Do you remember what happened and why it was lowered to 1MB? I bet you don't, newfriend! I hope summer never ends!

@_date: 2017-08-03 17:58:22
Is there any meaningful information in the difference between "fork" and "altcoin"?
Here are the implications:
1. a fork implies that you use the previous chain up to a point. There is a literal splitting / duplication of funds. You could make 10 forks every day, call them different things, but they'd all have the same functionality unless...
2. a fork implies that there is a functional/technical difference. This function could merely be people don't want some other asshole to be in charge of commits. So you fork the software and make a new repository and new "leadership" or lack thereof. Or it can have new literal functionality, like a rate or size tweak. If people don't agree on one or the other you can always see who agrees more via a process of trying both out. BUT THAT'S WORK. Why do the work when you can poll to see it without actually implementing it? That's the basis of open source, at least.
3. an altcoin implies complete detachment from other ideas. a fork generally does not.
That sums it up. In many people's minds, anything that is not the main bitcoin chain is a useless shitcoin... alt or fork, who cares? It's like shedding your cock skin then wearing it still.

or just do what i do and never refer to or speak of it, except by "it." It has no utility to me, and may as well not exist. It is a distraction to which only those who have the luxury of time and resources ought pay attention.
the bottomline is that the only thing that separates it from being just some other altcoin is that it uses the bitcoin blockchain up to a point.
That's all a fork is. Presumably there is some technological reason to fork, VERSIONA vs VERSIONB that are functionally different, but there does NOT have to be.
You could "fork" bitcoin every day and call it whatever the fuck you want. I've seen some really dumb posts regarding this, aka "enough people to cause a fork" ??? People think that a fork is really a bigger deal than it is, regarding what the leftovers are. The bigger deal was having enough consensus to add functionality, not that a bunch "resisted it" and is left pulling their own dicks with the scraps. 
It is very easy to fork bitcoin... being the dog under the table eating the scraps doesn't take much effort.

except you're an idiot if you think that by copy-pasting bitcoin you gain bitcoins value. No, you don't.
The entire value of bitcoin is in adoption.
So you'd basically be resetting bitcoin to 2010 valuation with every fork, with the population basically "premining" some. 
The bullshit you can smell a mile away is the BCC "valuation" of hundreds of dollars. Why, exactly? You can't use it anywhere, with anyone. Classic pump and dump structure.
Then consider how much less valuable these coins are when you think of the low total hashrate + miners. Who, wow, surprise, will support their ShitForkCoin because they're going to point their power at it from the beginning. 
even at a monthly pulse these fork coins are not sustainable. They will only be supported by those who are positioning themselves at the top of the pump and dump pyramid. We've already proven that.
If this is such a "big deal" look at the shit support it's gotten via wallets + exchanges. The next one would only have less, and so on.

It's a first hand view at how collaborations (conspirators) gain and maintain power from a genesis of a currency.
The idea that it will "balance out" because these power centers will start losing money and buckle to the will of the market is **not relevant** as long as the act of mining is coupled with literally generating bitcoin.

There was no assumption. There was no implication.
Why are these trolls stating "HAHA COINBASE IS A FRACTIONAL RESERVE" when nobody even mentioned that? "HAHA DON'T TRUST IT."
All it was was a simple statement about the average holding of a coinbase user. It said nothing as to the quality of that user, or even spoke towards what % of funds are available within coinbase.
We all know that coinbase could have some tiny % of the bitcoins they promise people and that's throttled by the average withdrawal over some timeframe. So why bring it up when someone posts a simple bit of trivia for scope context?

75% of Americans don't know how to use a computer past turning it on and clicking the facebook/email button. they don't know what websites are, or how to type addresses in.
So take these stats with a massive grain of salt, they're supposed to sound high but i'd assert that they're actually waaaaaaaaay low.
PS, you can't just ask 1000 people something and extrapolate to an entire population without representative demographics. And I'd argue that you can't even do those demographics with only 1000.
50 states * 20 people per state = 1000 people.
How are you going to find a demographic that represents all of New York, California, or Texas with just 20 people?
In certain places in the US there are ~75 nationalities, a dozen religions, all sorts of genders, political bias, education levels within A BLOCK.

Some times it's OK to dismiss bullshit as bullshit and not provide a fucking whitepaper when something is "obvious" to anyone who's spent any amount of time, you know, actually developing things.
But here I am, explaining simple logic to you because you can shit out some illogical nothing "you're being rude to an idiot therefore you can't make altcoins."
So yes, I stand by either they're a moron or they've got a disinformation agenda. They're both equally dangerous, but you'd expect one to actually fight back with substance while the other flails around miserably.
Bottomline is you don't schedule a fucking fork in this manner if you are not using it as a method to obtain support, so stating bullshit like "experts agree" is 100% handwavable, and legitimizing it like there are good actors behind it is, again, bullshit.

Theoretically, the big money players will buckle to the will of the market. 
Also theoretically, this won't happen for decades if not at the end of the "generation" phase of bitcoin.
In the end, bitcoin's valuation can floor out at the expense of generating bitcoin. Right back to the "1 btc = the cost of electricity and maintenance of hardware"
The only thing buoying that would be the value of utilizing it to "clean" money as well as all of that decentralization, sticking it to the powers that be, stuff.

yes, the part that's missing from the bitchfest about "high transaction fees" is that whole part about cost relative to holding gains and valuation. 
The gains alone from buying 1 coin at $100 to today's valuation will easily cover all transaction fees for the next decade unless you're literally day trading or something (you have bigger gov tax issues if you're doing that in the US, anyway).... Imagine if all your fiat bank transactions had bitcoin fees attached to it, but were inflated to match bitcoin's increasing valuation... I'd take that multiplier in exchange for those relatively trivial fees in a heartbeat.
Someone who's only seen some small fraction of gains hates transaction fees because it gobbles up more of their "profit."
someone with 10k coins that were valueless at one point could pay $1,000 each fee and still be a multi-millionaire. The balancing act there is being poisonous to the ecosystem and causing people to hold rather than use. Using is what increases valuation. New adoption also...
... so when someone new sees such a huge chunk of their "gains" eaten up by fees it 100% appears to be that they're simply the greater fool and paying for everyone before them's profit. That doesn't help adoption. Dig up all of the transaction bitchfests with people buying in at $300. Those same people complaining are the ones who'd erroneously extrapolate their fees back then with today's valuation (wow its like i paid millions of dollars in transactions if you take 2011's fees with 2017's valuation!)

If someone's lovin' the volatility enough to cash out and use it for goods, they should not mind receiving the refund.
I think newegg is shrewd to simply hoard bitcoin and not refund it. Even if it was a "fair trade" amount, in 5 years that bitcoin will potentially be worth way, way, way more. To the fault of the person deciding to use it in the first place to buy shit. Shrug.

That's idiotic: it is simple math that 
 cannot turn a decentralised ledger into a high-speed, high-volume payment settlement network.
The only rebuttal to this is that "well you can make it better than it currently is!"
Who gives a fuck about that? The endgame is that it cannot be that. So time is better spent towards developing how it MUST EVENTUALLY WORK.
Your proof is bullshit. So yes, you are drowning in bullshit. 
Explain how else you are going to attain "cup of coffee purchasing quickly" without sidechains that will inevitably be controlled by SOME entity. That entity could easily be open-source/non-profit. 
That has nothing to do with the horseshit that "core devs push sidechains because they profit from it with their centralizing sidechain." It could be 100% true that they are, that doesn't detract from the fact that sidechains are superior in theory, or that it isn't worth the development away from sidechains when at some point it will obviously be necessary to keep transaction fees and times in check.
Go ahead and create your own fucking sidechain and standard that everyone loves, that is open source and developed freely. But drop the twat routine that the only reason that sidechains are "being pushed" is because capitalists have invested in centralizing sidechains. LOL last I checked it isn't a requirement to use liquid or any other service, so this is garbage. What if you made a sidechain that was everything except requiring KYC, verification, centralization, or whatever? That isn't impossible.
If better can be done, it will be done. It will be embraced. Until then, fuck off with the FUD
Of course, my argument can be silenced by any of these dickheads proposing exactly how they see bitcoin functioning for cups of coffee if there is even **1/2** of visa's transactional volume... and were at what again, right now? Not even ~1/50th - 1/100th? LOL.

Who the fuck are you talking to? People either disagree or agree with you. Congratulations, you're just the next person arguing.
These concepts are years old now. The philosophical argument of what the function of bitcoin itself is. The resistance about if it is A instead of B and vice versa, who wins and loses in the short term. 
TL;DR: 1. says you. 2. nothing new here. 3. I wouldn't say "hurt" when Bitcoin exists in some form no matter what humans do to it, at this point. Make a fork and see how it "catches on" if you want more proof of that.

(tx size with witness data stripped) * 3 + (tx size) = weight
non-segwit has 0 witness data, the weight = 4x the size
Segwit has &gt;0 witness, so weight &lt; 4x size
That established, the witness data can be vastly different for the same weight.
[consider this example lifted from here](
800 byte Segwit with 400 byte witness
1100 byte segwit with 800 byte witness
500 byte non-segwit
All 3 of those have the identical weight of 2000. Yet it is clear which are likely to be less profitable to a miner.
You could theoretically have a 4MB block of segwit that has &lt; 1MB when the witness data is stripped.
segwit transactions are 2/3 witness data. so that's where the "unfair weighting" comes from. You are doing more work for less weight. 
So sure, you get upvotes for being wrong and I get downvoted for being right because of a blind hatred for some wingding who I have no respect for: I am just explaining them to be correct in theory, but incorrect in practice.

So lets get your joke straight:
1. using bitcoin is like using visa at the DMV except more expensive.
2. you couldn't actually use bitcoin at the DMV realistically because bitcoin is grossly slower than visa
3. you're making a parallel between something that we're essentially forced into using that is insured, monitored and has fraud protection as a result and something that people struggle to find realistic uses for (due to converting out of fiat initially for 99.9999999999% of use cases) that is uninsured, not monitored and has no fraud protection.
4. you don't seem to mind that you can reverse charges if someone rips you off with visa, yet with bitcoin someone can receive the coin and fuck you over, responding ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. I DUNNO LOL. and what are you going to do about it, exactly?
5. you think this snarky joke makes bitcoin look better, not worse.

This is idiotic (like good comedians have to be) while containing a grain of truth.
Obviously the idea is that there is no "switch" to flip. That's the entire point. Who controls the switch?
The bigger fear, now, is the **splinternet.** Where every ISP has their own version of the internet and all traffic is 100% controlled. One way to crush adoption of bitcoin/crypto is to have very specific internets that do very specific things, literally at an app level with proprietary protocols. You can take your cryptos then, and do 0 with them, because there'd be no way to convert it to anything. All retail "acceptance of bitcoin" will disappear because in order to tie in to the central banking systems they'd have to use one of these proprietary systems. 
When fiat becomes 100% digital, you will never be able to convert bitcoin to anything valuable without approval from the central bank.

it's only "stuck for days" because other wallets default higher fees. if everyone paid 10 cent fee transaction there would be nobody "stuck" except for bitcoin millionaires risking higher fees to cause said roadblock.

if you think a major market force still isn't people/miners spamming low value, high relative transaction fees as a way to inflate transactions, I don't know what to tell you.
just look at the fucking "pending transaction fees" ... do you honestly think people without that massive rift between their buyins and current valuation are the ones to blame for massively overvalued transactions? LOL

If there were no fees AND miners couldn't fuck with blocks it would be bounty only and perfectly viable. 
And the value would be exactly the same. But you would lose the pump + dump dust transaction bullshit we saw at the beginning of this year, clogging up things and artificially jacking fees up.
...that is, perfectly viable up until there are no more bounties. Then what?
The combination of miners' ability to be selective about blocks requires fees, as the greedy miner will want to be the most profitable, so it acts as a protection from that miner excluding things intentionally or just going for bounties. Why would you when there are more btc to get via fees?
Another side effect of fees is preventing dust spam attacks. Except that, again, right now, doesn't work because a satoshi is not worth that much. 
But as that unit becomes more valuable, dust becomes less likely due to them fees.

Either way, both versions are flawed. Make a simple checkout with bitcoin at the end of the process and show everybody.

Now explain how bitcoin is developed, because for as wide open it is there seems to be some personal / vested interest from the developers, right?
I think you're being overly semantic: the core idea that "something better can and will come along" is valid in the argument that "btc=wikipedia."
Wikipedia blows for a lot of reasons. It's also great for a lot of reasons. It'll also eventually disappear or be absorbed by something else, and probably sooner rather than later.

No - you don't understand what the process here implies. Most of this thread so far are just spouting off without seeing the point of it.
[Black money is illegal.](
You don't just "turn over" the money or exchange it. You have to declare it. Once you declare it, they obviously know how much you're declaring and can look at tax records to see how much you claimed you had. The jailtime referred to is basically an extreme for those who have such an abundance of this currency that they didn't pay taxes on. 
**Obviously if you didn't care about "having the money" you could just destroy it and not face any punishment.** The fines/jail isn't that you have it, it's that you've obviously not paid taxes on an exorbitant amount of this old money.
If you obtained the cash legitimately and paid taxes on it, exchanging/declaring it is completely trivial.

to extend the metaphor: how does the poker dealer know that the new card you invented that’s higher than an Ace is a change?
They don’t need to, because they know Ace is the highest pair so if you do SuperAce it is meaningless according to their table of “winning hands.”
Where you’re getting hung up is that you can change the winning hand table that dealer has and “cheat.”
with bitcoin you’d have to change that for majority of dealers in the world because consensus is needed. it would be the same as the dealer checking with &gt;50% of the dealers in the world to verify the highest hand in poker is Aces and thus ignore &amp; reject SuperAces.
Likewise changing the bitcoin maximum alters how big each block reward is and when that would be confirmed by someone non-hacked, it would be rejected

Huh? You have very little understanding of "Indians in general."
This is the equivalent of saying "turn in all of your current US dollars, and DECLARE them, and exchange for the new ones." 
If you walk into a bank with $10,000,000 current US dollars, gosh, you can't evade taxes, huh? so it is either lose those illegal dollars or declare it. I'm sure there are crypto workarounds, but then the person selling the crypto is holding on to that worthless money... and so on. So "crypto will save india" bullshit is irrelevant there.
It is really that simple. For all the bitching people do in these parts of reddit about this crap they don't seem to come to terms with the fact that the USA is supported vastly by taxation on the POOR, not the RICH. The black markets in india come from the middle and upper-middle classes, mostly, evading taxes. 
Imagine if every person in the US that owned a house really got it by tax evasion? That's what's trying to be fixed.  
India "competes" with the USA is a silly concept. Both have thriving upper classes on the backs of the poor. What other metric are you using? Overall poverty levels don't mean shit when you talk about GDP or booming industries.
The top fraction of 1% in both cases legally evade taxation using the tools of their governments. 0 difference.

Ignoring all of the hilarity in how whenever we talk about crypto all you hear about it how intricately banks must know your customer, when you can read how awful their KYC was for cartels, etc...
... the problem with banks being crypto friendly is pretty simple regarding a data storage and KYC viewpoint. 
It's baffling to me that there is any difference between an account using crypto and, say, opening a checking or savings account. All banks have to go through KYC for those, too, usally just via whatever corroborating ID. Why not the same rigor for crypto? Can't someone open a bogus account at a bank and someone else use it perpetually? And so on.
This is something much bigger: a data gathering to put a face with the actual crypto holdings. That's why these specialized "banks" and exchanges are not your ordinary bank or instruments.

The problem with your plan/post to some is that the term "retire" doesn't simply mean "have enough money to not work." 
IE, if I had enough money to retire young I wouldn't retire. I'd still work on shit, make more money, and then when I stop working I have enough to have a good time.

Who's definition?
You can do a quick google search and find dozens of definitions of what a cryptocurrency is.
**Many believe that a cryptocurrency MUST NOT BE CENTRALLY ISSUED, as a centrally issued cryptocurrency might as well NOT be a cryptocurrency since it is censorable from that point of failure.**
By your definition, any fiat that is transferred over HTTPS is a Cryptocurrency. Does that sound right to you?
The core problem with whatever GovCoin, or Libra, is that since it is centralized it is by default censorship friendly: 51% attackable from the central authority on the coin. And so all of the actual cryptography is completely pointless, and there are plenty of scenarios where the &gt;51% majority could just falsify the ledger (which you wouldn't necessarily have access to, in the name of "efficiency" and "user friendliness")  
It's like saying a safe deposit box in a bank is secure from the bank itself because it's your belongings in the box. Not your box, not your belongings. I'm sure for something important enough there are plenty of ways to make it look like you visited the box and took whatever was missing. Or scenarios like "pockets outturned" sorry we'll be giving you an IOU for that from the bank. Back to libra: is it a crypto if someone at facebook can make your database entry say "0 shitcoins" in it at will, regardless of what the ledger says?
In fact, things like Libra and Apple Credit Card with Apple Wallet support might as well be the same thing according to 99.9999% of the modern consumers. They don't give a flying fuck about "fucking over banks" via crypto for a few simple reasons: 
1. they are forced to use fiat because there is no other choice and 
2. they have student/biz loans or mortgages through banks already.
And this sub pissed its diaper when Ver was pulling the ol' bitcoin.com  bullshit, get ready for the normie saturation when facebook starts talking about how facebook users are 3-hole skimask hacker levels of sophistication because Libra is EVEN BETTER THAN bitcoin, why look at all of the immediate uses for it. Oh, how frustrating it will be when the "crypto dominance" of whatever normie coins swallows bitcoin whole, eh?
Of course, that's what these discussions amount to: trying to position + clarify these coins as "not crypto." 
**Unfortunately, clarification is not more sensational and impressive than blurting out dumb shit, especially when that dumb shit looks like wisdom to whatever dickhead still uses facebook.**

The follow-up to all of this is always the same thing: what would you have instead?
Everything is "natural," that is, forces create environments that create forces and so on, forever. 
There is always going to be an ultimate master. Do you think the final masters will be some plural minority that "collaborate?" They will destroy each other the second they can, or at least organize hierarchically. 
Democracy is a simple paradox. You can't have the majority "vote" and enforce equality, they will always pull those that excel in the environment in two directions simultaneously: financially they will pull them towards the have-nots end, and functionally they are pulled towards a management role.
We want the people in charge to be subservient at the same time. If you find a better way to manage that than with simple capitalism, please share.
I don't disagree with anything you're saying, I just notice a lack of any sort of alternative or resolve. 
These forces are destined to happen based on pre-organic structures leading into technology leading into meta-philosophies.
ANY group can only be as powerful as those that would willfully be represented by that group. Group_X wanting rights has to be big enough to make an impact on the majority to obtain those rights, or even representation. 
Post-gender we will be dealing with concepts like technologically-enhanced humans and their rights. Things like internet privacy and neutrality will literally directly impact our physicality and existence more than "how we use the internet" once we are plugged directly into the internet.
There are certain things that are simply inevitable. There are always going to be rulers, leaders and some aggregate policy making. There is always going to be technology that replaces systems and other technologies, and those will always be decided upon by the environment and the leaders and the vanguard of that culture. 
Something like bitcoin that is currently able to coexist with these other systems is the residue of that vanguard. We are all waiting for what the true power-wielders will do to support or subvert it, it should not be taken for granted as something inevitable.
Likewise the internet voting abilities increasing democratization. That should not be granted as inevitable, especially when most democracies are pulling away from the idea that there is "too much democracy." That is bad.
Next up will be how automation balances out population doubling every 40 years. There will literally be 2x as many people in 2057 as there are now.

What you're saying doesn't make sense but I think this is a semantic differentiation issue. 
A wallet could trivially censor.
A wallet could send all your coins to it's own address. Or block any of your addresses from receiving anything within the wallet, or outgoing to whatever.

.1. yes, they could try. yes, but it is more likely that someone locates an atom from when you farted 2 years ago.
**to put this into  context, the odds that you find ANY address that contains &gt;0 coins, out of ALL addresses in use... from ALL similar crypto are statistically equivalent to finding any 1 address** that is, 0 chance on any mortal's timeline.
.2. no. no. because at some point crypto = the only money.
.3. no
.4. because bitcoin is infinitely divisible
.5. because "communication+anonymity= increased shitskull retardation." trust is a weakness and requiring trust is only available to those with power.

It IS arbitrary. "last traded value * all coins in existence" = cap? when such a huge % has been dormant, or traded at lower value? ugh.
What would be useful, and is not a statistic you can see easily, is what every bitcoin in existence's "traded market value" was at time of trade.
Knowing how many of a coin was never traded, and somehow magically divining which trades were ACTUALLY for something of value and not just to yourself would be useful to finding what that market energy was.
When you realize that 50% of all bitcoin in existence was around when each bitcoin was worth &lt; 50$, yet the "current cap" is what it is...
...you'll see how idiotic market caps are when valuation is so volatile, or is for something that isn't "backed" by anything. Shareholders hold shares in a company because the company is supposed to innovate and profit. Their market cap aggregates with, you know, an actual market where you can say "market XYZ has these entities in it and when you sum their caps you get the value of the market."
The confidence trick is that the market cap for bitcoin is "all the money in the world is replaced with bitcoin and all bitcoin is mined, divide all money by 21M and you have the value of 1btc" which when I saw that number puts 1btc worth 66 billion dollars if it replaces all derivatives (~1-2quad$/21m) or whatever M0-3 you use at least in the hundreds of thousands if not millions.
The bottom line is that it REQUIRES dismantling the current systems otherwise it will just embed as a channel within those, so it would never replace anything.

I dunno gang, I'm gonna need some more data to confirm that 
"2x less bitcoin generated per day means the baseline cost to mine 1btc is 2x more."
Can someone confirm if I suddenly doubled your expenses per day for bitcoin mining that it would cost you more to get the same amount of bitcoin each day.
And to double check, please confirm that if you cut the amount of bitcoin you get each day in half, that your expenses were now 2x?
I'm just completely unclear on this so I'm gonna need a bunch of charts with lines on them. 
Spoiler: 50% of all bitcoin was mined at a pricepoint less than $50. That means the triple halvening puts the cost of a bitcoin at 50\*2\*2\*2=$400 MINIMUM.
And so, I declare that bitcoin will never go under $400.
And if you do the math for every remaining halvening, 2140 is 120 years away that's 30 more halvenings so bitcoin's price will double 30 more times.

Discovery and volatility go hand in hand, and the volatility is rearing its head because the price discovery has priced people out of it. 
Someone saying "my transaction of X cost Y and that's too much!" is entirely depending on the converted valuation of bitcoin and if the user is even using bitcoin directly instead of the blockchain's utility as a ledger. 
There are many methods towards making smaller relative payments viable and less expensive. But they all rely on some form of centralization or parallelism. 
Bitcoin wasn't "meant" or "not meant" to handle every valuation and every use-case. It specifically does things well and allows you to attach other technologies to handle what it doesn't.

What you're calling shortcuts, I would call "you need an editor."
You have parenthetical statements outside of parenthetical commas, you have parentheses, you have ellipses that are used for pacing rather than indicative of additional thought. You're halfway in between using punctuation as a representation of your speaking patterns and content.
You use verbose qualifications of statements, when you could simply qualify them by saying what you have to say (just say what you mean, no need for "thus").
One of the key reasons short, punchy memes have taken hold of popular thought patterns is that they typically have no fat on them: every word is essential to the point being made. That is the double edged sword of being verbose, it is prone to inessential fat and after a few obvious bloated lines it becomes discardable to all but the most patient readers.
Another reason is that when you present an avalanche of thought + statement, it's fruitless to pick out specific snowballs to counter it all as an aggregate. You can type out 10,000 words and if one of those words is dubious, the discussion is mired / irrelevant to all but the most fastidiously analytical.


This is not one sentence. I'll punch it up for you:
first pass for efficiency:
"merchants along with their vendors and customers" = marketplaces
"individually rational reason" = reason
"for these players or most anyone" = redundant, obviously "people" and "companies" are the ones engaging here
"thus" = not necessary when providing a conclusion or therefore to a cause and effect pattern.
"all start...right now" = either this is redundant or implied on either end.
second pass for thought structure:
"we are using the prospect of massive gains."  No we're not. In fact, the core idea behind marketplace adoption of bitcoin is the small scale gains of transaction fees / conversion rates versus having credit card companies or banks take a guaranteed cut on the merchant end. The massive gains idea is only for a small subset of the customer population, where the major benefit there is control over your assets without centralized forces. The anonymity angle as well as the "you could be rich beyond your wildest dreams" are not a vital or central mission here.
"(even though firms aren't normally in the good habit of getting into foreign currency speculation at the expense of their regular business)" 
This is not a parenthetical, this is crucial to your main point.
"we are making the profit opportunities" No, we're not. The marketplace is in perpetual discovery. Adoption rates are nowhere near saturation. The profit opportunities make themselves via any sort of speculation. No different than buying a limited edition sneaker or toy. We don't "make" the opportunities, you can't blame selling or holding or using as some sort of individualized effort. Opportunities just "are" in the case of this sort of system of limited edition, unless you are claiming some sort of conspiratorial effort. 
"thus they all start demanding the token for itself rather than as a proxy for the "real" money that they ultimately want to exchange it for right now."
Again, this the same for any object that has value. Someone can buy a star wars toy to invest in it and never play with it. 
**Summary, curt reduction**
**The current volatility, in this perpetual discovery phase, allows the opportunity to treat bitcoin as a potentially lucrative investment alongside its intrinsic utility.**
I think that covers what you said without any sort of useful information removed. The words imply things, ie, "treating bitcoin" means merchants, vendors, customers engaging with it in a marketplace.
In fact, the only useful addition that was cut was the bit about how investors typically wouldn't bother. My reduction assumes knowledge about what investors would typically do. Yours reveals it, but in an awkward parenthetical statement. 
I could rewrite your single sentence for clarity, to maintain the verbosity, but I think I've covered what those edits would be above.

50% of all bitcoin in existence was around when valuation was sub 50$. The joke was that it hit those levels after a huge "omg bitcoin is mooning" crash. And people back then said the same thing you're saying now. "it's only for the lucky or those who had it years ago." Yet 100% of the people who were pissing and moaning about bitcoin not even a few years ago would be seeing 120x their investment right now? So yeah, BULLSHIT.
The people you're referring to mooned a long time ago, are on the moon and playing games with the valuation. Think of the big names and the bullshit they're pushing/supporting because they have TENS OF THOUSANDS of coins...
These are the same people that can risk/leverage "bigly" because they'd be mooned even if it dropped to $100 each
It's baffling to me that people don't realize this, and are praying for their 2x multiple, when the forces they're interacting with HAVE ALREADY SEEN 6000-20000x multipliers.
Never mind that likely the majority of entities/people who actually bought at 15-20k were buying their own fucking coins and eating the fees just to pump... that amount going to $40k for a 2x multiplier is seeing 40,000x multiplier.
There is literally no competition here. The people that whaled do things like start/back their own coin, buy media channels off to pump their shitcoins, get board jobs for their scammer pals, and have pleeeeeenty left over.

First of all, that's technically not YOU reusing an address, it's them.
So yes, you can send to it again.
but don't assume they'll receive it.
it could be considered a security measure to receive coin from an address, move it elsewhere and burn the address to add plausible deniability that it was yours alone. this is not a likely scenario, but it is possible.
Best security practices is that you should not send from the same address and they should not receive at the same address. But you totally can.

we don't need multiple blockchains, you can attach anything to the main blockchain without bloating it.
just because a blockchain is tokenized doesn't mean it "must" have anything to do with currency, and nobody can control that anyway.
I agree with you philosophically, but it's too late: every new blockchain besides centralized ones would be trivial to 51% attack so we're stuck with using bitcoin unless we trust some smaller shitcoin will never get compromised orrrrrrr some privately mined blockchain is "trustworthy."
@_date: 2019-08-01 17:10:08
No. This sounds like a solution in search of a problem. \/fartsound
All a blockchain can do is store the evidence with a timestamp.
It cannot prove the validity of the evidence.
Remember when people were claiming ownerships of paintings and shit on a blockchain? 
You will always need a 3rd party "validation" mechanism.
For example, how does anyone know this image wasn't photoshopped or otherwise tampered, that there was full consent, that it wasn't a deepfake, and so on. 
For now, at least, real life doesn't have the technology to photoshop yourself in real time to provide forgeries and dupe a 3rd party.
The closest thing we'd have is that the notary would lock this into the blockchain instead of the private citizen. For a fee, of course.
So, like, getting around deepfakes would be great if video streams were blockchained with timestamps as authentication.

Best case scenario would be that this bar would work with the ATM to allow 0 confirmations (snort) so they'd take the risk on while waiting for conf. 
Otherwise, this article would have been about "how expensive the fee was to prioritize the confirmation."

So you don't care about the originator + the "true story" behind the origins, but you care about a few whales? Zzz. The bottomline behind these stories are either people who got in early, or people with lots of cash who got in later.
People don't seem to fully realize the volume that was possible in the early days. We're talking 50 btc mining on a CPU every few minutes, then eventually hours, then eventually days.

@_date: 2018-06-14 20:21:30


Sorry but if you think the community is in half their crappy propaganda is working. It's all anecdote but I wouldn't consider it any more than a small splinter. There is no "grand philosophical divide." There was a fork, and not every fork creates two more-or-less even proportioned tines.


People are stupid. Especially when they feel like they've missed out on something big, and are rationalizing how if it was good it would have been more fair or more accessible. I told everyone I know about bitcoin when it was worth $1, a few bought in, others didn't. And there's a very clear dividing line between those who think it is "valuable" and those who think it's "stupid."


This is the rhetoric of those who are currently "losing." More than 50% of the coins were in existence when it was worth $50. Are they losing? Hell, the value of bitcoin has increased so much it's allowed whales to make their OWN coins and further gain...  so please explain what, exactly, was a bubble?
There are people who would be multimillionaires from bitcoin if it dropped down to $100 each...


For all you know they're suppressing crypto knowledge or negging it to keep the valuation low. ycombinator definitely doesn't "hate" crypto, LMAO they're one of the biggest investors, are you fucking kidding?


Sounds like YOU'RE focused on that. Here's an idea: unplug. The internet, especially reddit, is like a 24/7 channel of spam, bullshit and idiocy with the occasional nugget of wisdom tossed in. 
Otherwise, just go to a fucking developer forum where people are discussing the technology.
It's like bitching about the cartoon pages in a newspaper when you can just read the business pages... these are general forums, not specific. so you're going to get general/popular content. reddit is all about "popularization" over quality. There is plenty of quality content that gets no votes because it doesn't have a bot army upvoting it to get clicks/views.


Do you not know how these forums / social news works? Bringing it up incessantly gives the fodder + puts it on people's radars, so when something like an academic paper comes out it creates more of an impact than if it wasn't a "current topic."


When you stopped sorting out the fat from the meat. It takes work. The fat is very easy to produce. A oneline shit post might take 10 paragraphs, historical insight, and 1000x more effort to refute, or you can create more offal by responding in kind.
either way, you're adding noise. And noisy channels get abandoned for certain types of discussions. 
**Case in point, this thread.** It is a meta-discussion about how "the community" might be perceived. But replace "the community" with reddit. There are other forums and other places to discuss things. Maybe everything you're saying is FUD itself. Oh, is the community "halved?" Oh, are there really "problems" ... oh is the spirit really "lost"? Or did you just type that and add it to the noise?
I'm not "united" with you because this doesn't bother me and I essentially think you're mischaracterizing and overgeneralizing. I'm therefore not sad. But also, my perspective of "the community" is very specific and not good or bad. To me, the community consists of a bunch of phantoms online and one guy I met buying graphics cards in 2012 who was setting up a mining rig. Whoopty do.
Without aggressive moderation, all you're doing is allowing newbs to clutter up everything with beginner questions. Look at quora if you want to see what happens when there is no real "hey this shit was asked 10,000 times before" versus stack exchange which feels dickish at times but they have a good search function.
reddit's search function is so easily defeated and since people tend to not actually POST content, the search itself is vapid. So you can have 10,000 bullshit shill blogs all saying the same essential thing and stagger linking out to them. 
Versus if someone actually had to type the content out, and provide links... that 1 statement could not be reposted 10,000 times.
So ask yourself, what is reddit for and what does it promote. To frame your statements on ONE CHANNEL on the internet without coming to terms that maybe that channel is largely to blame is foolish.

The logic is nonsensical: they don't want to prove who they are due to security and plausible deniability from rubber hose attacks (trivial to actually protect against, you'd hope "the inventor" of bitcoin would know how to do this) but they want all of the benefits of others thinking that they are Satoshi.

The problem with dollar cost averaging is you have 0 concept of how much 1 btc is actually worth.  
Market caps are bullshit, and it is impossible to really know what % of trades at whatever value are even legitimate, and not just eating fees while purchasing whatever you sell in order to give the illusion of volume.
Over 50% of all bitcoin in existence was there when the valuation was ~$50 each. 
How much bitcoin is being held that was bought at $20k? Non-zero. How much at $6k?
Now, ask yourself how much was bought at $50. That's the mystery.
When you're sitting on the other end of the orderbook and know what you're carving out to sell to clients, you know all positions. You can see what was publicly traded and you know it wasn't just some manipulation tactic because volatility isn't as ridiculous as it is with crypto.
And then count in the fact that ALL crypto is obviously wash and arbitrage traded, which again doesn't really exist in other spaces as reliably.
None of this goofy shit is backed by a company providing a service that creates demand, and trades publicly to generate capital to increase productivity. 
The closest analogy is that early devs' paycheck is by developing it the value increases. But now? They move off to focus on tangents or for-profit entities to, you know, get some return.
So nah, all you're doing is feeding the whales who were REQUIRED to "believe the tech" by buying now. We're just playing a waiting game for some sort of utility or integration happens that pulls the value back up. 
The simple fact that you have to feed into it with $$$$ to get BTC and use it means the system is irrelevant. 
Think of it this way: what if the valuation never changed again. The tech still works, right? You would buy into it to USE it, but really all you're doing is letting those with tens of thousands to break you off some for THEIR profits on initial investment.
I mean, the cap is now what $115 billion-ish? If someone bought a sizable chunk that would obviously moon. Why don't they? They'd get immediate profit, right, because buying at X increases the value of that X simultaneously... perhaps its because of the weariness of the market that sees the same pump/dump cycle over and over, eh

This is moronic. There was a dev team that nobody even knows about, or can pin onto any individual or entity, prior to the open sourcing. There still is a "dev team" regarding the main fork. Someone has to control it. 
And what's to stop whatever other crypto from ground-up development exactly the same way we assume (or pretend) bitcoin was developed?

No, it really is not and essentially makes zero sense. In fact, your entire rambling post makes zero sense. 
There are a number of people who work with money on a daily basis here and the idea that there are "fake dollars" that convincingly pass anyone but morons are basically using the myth to sow disinformation. Oh the dollar is so easy to fake! 
White and green ink? LOL. Even "back then" it was LOL that you think it was trivial to maintain the integrity of the paper stock while defacing it to pass as a $100. And any place with good security would simply reach for the $100 marker and see that the paper was not for the $100s, but I guess you think people were chemically treating the fibers to dupe the markers as well? The problem with that is if you knew how it worked you'd know it would basically be impossible to do.
Also LOL that you think a printer that could print convincing US currency is only $5,000. That shows how absolutely non-authoritative you are on the topic.
You bring up Walmart and how convincing it was, yet you know it was fake, so it got caught. I mean you only have to fool someone with the aptitude of a cashier, so your point right there invalidates itself. 
Yes, it is incredibly easy to pass fake cash to untrained, disinterested middlemen.
Easy to counterfeit != Easy to pass fakes at walmart. Also, Walmart generally doesn't give a shit because it is more expensive to deal with it than it is to let it slide. Which is why it is common to scam their returns/receipts.
The truth is much simpler: any "widespread counterfeiting ring" that has international, needle moving ramifications is 100% done with concent and cooperation of the government in question.
It is completely absurd to think that counterfeiters would bother with one of the most complicated bills (even in simplest 1980s forms) on the planet when with less attention and less effort as well as cost they could trivially output other bills and exchange them.

You said it was super easy. It is not.

I can think of plenty of finite supply items that are worthless and avoided by the rich.
I can think of other finite supply items that are affordable to any class and held on to regardless of value because the market never valuates it that much higher than original cost.
And of course I can think of finite supply items that become the pawns or markers of the rich. Good thing 0 of those are "necessities."

No, no it is not.


You're making a strawman assertion about what taint is, and how common tumbling is, then concluding the way you are.
You are grossly overestimating the number of coins that touched any sort of notable taint, and the magnitude of it. For example: silk road coins could be easily + freely blocked with the exception of those coins that were auctioned by the gov.
The truth of the matter is that you'd have to be a dope to tumble clean coins and even worse, a criminal in the eyes of a gov, as why else would you freely accept provably shit coins related to things provably illegal where you are?
I get it, privacy. But I'd rather not have privacy than harbor criminals by obfuscating their money with mine.

Google has no monopoly, unlike standard oil. I don't use Google. 
They apparently have the best tool, a tool so good that tweaks to it can shatter businesses. The cottage industry that you "need" to chase their algorithm to increase your business is garbage. I've been around this noise since pre-google, and all they were ever after is to get you hooked in to their systems so you chase around whatever their tools require.
Idea: don't rely on that tool.
I am a part of an institution that ranks faaaaar lower on sistrix than yours, and we don't rely on google to pull in hundreds of millions a year. I'm sure our "google score" lowered, as well. Shrug. Reliance on some 3rd party tool for our business seems like horrid planning. (we also don't have an app for the same reason).
LOL @ "your demands" of google. you should take them to court.

If you had 1 whole bitcoin that you paid $0.01 for in 2009, you would have gained 76,719,900%
1 bitcoin would have to be worth $5,885,958,400 to see that same % increase.
That said, the modern maximum valuation of bitcoin is easy to calculate. just replace all money with bitcoin.
According to the CIA in 2017, $80 trillion of "broad money" existed.
that would make 1 bitcoin worth about $3,809,523.81 if all broad money was replaced with it.
At the same time M0 was worth $1.5 trillion. That is $71,428 per 1 btc.

Just convert some % of your fiat into bitcoin, no matter what the price point is. There is only a few months in the history of bitcoin where this would have been a loss, and it is more than made up by the few years where it would be a multi-million percent gain.
Even better, just get rid of a hobby or vice and every time you have the impulse to do that, buy bitcoin instead. Your dopamine will adjust to the point that the gains (and the rollercoaster down) will be infinitely more wish fulfilling than whatever you replaced.

So you've got more "hacker wannabe" types who want to at least take some part in the digital revolution besides, uh, owning a smartphone who will put up with these awful services and poor designs that are relatively better than the previous iterations...
and now LN, in its infancy, is much the same. Where if you don't understand bitcoin why just read this poorly designed chart that is full of jargon and confusing terms/ideas that leave questions unanswered and cause you to ask more questions, it's "the future."
It's a huge turn-off to most of the population on earth, and until it hits that tipping point where it is "critical" that a good user experience is necessary for any further adoption, it likely won't get much better.

or is your suggestion aware that for someone to buy bitcoin they're buying it from someone else (probably at a profit).
miners could operate at a loss for years at this point and still profit greatly, assuming they were mining ~5+ years ago
what's really shit is that nobody revisits and posts these stupid fucking predictions when they're wrong, and most of them are wrong. it would be trivial to collect the 1,000s of "here's my analysis of lines on a chart" and their wrong predictions. the "it can't go lower than this!" or the "here's the pattern we've seen every halvening."
over 50% of the bitcoin was mined at a pricepoint of &lt;50$. popularity and the arms race for mining power is the vast majority of the valuation at this point, since the cost to mine 1 bitcoin is far, far more than 50$ for 15 minutes.

You're the one chiming in with spoonfed western propaganda nonsense, you have no idea what I do and do not know, but what is established is that you're parroting shit that is suddenly oh so newsworthy. It's a bit hilarious to me that someone would assert "if I knew about China..." first of all, that's the purpose of this diarrhea on reddit, to make sure everyone has an indoctrinated "knowledge" of China. It's improbable that anyone doesn't "know" what you're saying, on reddit. Secondly, your shitty logical fallacy "IF YOU KNEW THEN YOU'D AGREE WITH ME" can go out back into the dumpster. 
Where were your posts about this years ago? Nowhere, that's where. Oh, just a coincidence. I guess I need access to the forums where you discuss the oppression of Hong Kong with the rest of your brain trust. You can do an easy enough reddit search for anti-chinese rhetoric and WEIRD most of it happened since Trump decided to pretend like they don't own most of the US debt!
Weird, I didn't see any "banking news" out of China for nearly a decade on any bitcoin sub/forum that wasn't directly related to mining, policy or usage.
But suddenly the US Gov decides to embark on a propaganda/trade war with Iran and China and miraculously reddit is literally splashed with tons of shit about both countries and how bad they are. Miraculously this touches on sports, entertainment, commerce, media, video games, crypto, cooking, wildlife trade, human rights, genocide, metoo, smartphones, AMA and even futurology.
Yes, not a concerted effort at all!
And their issue with the extradition policy was the catalyst here (somehow that was magnified vastly more than equally shitty policies in over the past century, how convenient). Yet that was resolved.
So, oh brave keyboad commander, I ask you: what exactly are the protests supposed to acccomplish? What would have to happen for them to say "OK, we're done."
Nothing, because it's just a sabre rattling "bad PR stunt" by the powers that be.
But I'm supposed to think "Oh, ok, I see how this is related. China has banks and in times like this banks are bad so bitcoin is good and China is bad also!"

people need to at least realize that blockchain tech applied to gov fiat would be very good for auditing and tracking, at the cost of any semblance of privacy.

blackjack is predictable and winnable depending on the agreement of rules.
bitcoin has the intrinsic value of being an untouchable store of wealth, unlike fiat.
saying "it's like gambling" is because your involvement is to buy at X and sell at Y when Y&gt;X.
To put it another way, banks "close your account" if they don't like you moving around too much, or too often, bitcoin money. How's that make you feel? When "official" money is just as tainted? 
Funny, I can buy and sell other things. Why are these tokens considered so hostile and poisonous? 
Control is why. Just like a casino can ban you for winning too much.
And this isn't a neckbeard libertarian slant, it's a "the people with money will suppress others from wresting control away from them by setting policy via threat of incarceration, seizure and violence." 
Think about it this way: you trigger suspicious activity at a bank via bitcoin, wouldn't it make much more sense for that bank -- who has all of your personal information -- to let it keep going so that an investigation into your "crimes" can occur? Now think why they just shut it down, instead.

it's not a viable analogy.
a more correct analogy to follow b'cash logic is, it's better to have the ability to make a new phone every year with more capacity than it is to have phones with only 1gig that require 3rd party peripherals to expand over it.
the counter argument is segwit is good enough until layer2 kicks in.
political asswipery aside, it's a philosophical split really. you either thing segwit/l2(through lightning, for example) is fine or that it's antithetical to the point of bitcoin.
the counter to all of this is that MORE centralization happens when you need more space to run nodes.

sad thing is the takeaway from this is "banks are bad for protecting their assets and mitigating risk" and not "using banks is bad, just acquire and use crypto directly and you won't have that problem."
Also, your account was flagged before it had anything to do with bitcoin, and only the "e-transfer" some rando gave you.

people seem to think that "the DOW" is some sort of static asset, like you hold diversified investments and even when they drop to 41.2 points it's ok when it rebounds back up. 
No, the DJIA mutates to choose other stocks and recalibrate, shedding losers to keep the illusion of upward gains.
If you don't pay to manage your money, an investment in the DOW could literally be worth 0, even as the index itself is recalibrated to be worth more.
No idea what the point of this shitpost is, it's poorly worded. Is it that "bitcoin falling is exactly like the dow falling?" 
That the entire currency system of sovereign nation is the same as ... crypto?
hmmm ok
I thought you might be making some sort of post referring to bitcoin's current state, which everyone I know of who takes it seriously think it's easily 25-50% "pumped" right now, and will likely crash before readjusting to under where it is, so the halvening would be lucky to flatline it at 8k

your impression of early internet is what we call a “strawman.”
my impression of early internet is the beginning of shared data storage. You say that has no place in the real world? I guess you never transitioned from paper accounting of a multinational corporation to digital accounting, and how much of a money saver it was.
Shared research papers, shared datasets.
The internet was a superior answering machine, the internet allowed near instantaneous mass discussion and data sharing internationally.
The world “working fine” has nothing to do with obviously better applications via a system. 
With crypto the “better applications” do not exist yet for the mass population. 
Contractual agreements for basically free are great, not exacty mass appeal.
Everything else it does, people with centralized banking use for free by giving up control that was already given up a long time ago.

This seems dubious to me, as you're still equating "early holders" with some sort of diversification strategy, and treating bitcoin as some sort of value game to play + win.
Knock yourself out, but the difference you're looking for is the difference between having generational wealth and "being rich."
Judging by homeyhomedawg's history asking about garbage like rolexes, that's going for short over long term. 
At any point, save for a small 2 month window, the wrong answer would be to "sell" or "diversify." But yes, you could have sold in those two months and have "more bitcoin" due to it or a cool watch, house, car, island, whatever.
We're in the accumulation phase either until the value of bitcoin stabilizes to the point that it has predictability OR, it is irrelevant because some L2 uses the blockchain and that'll be the new coin which is simply backed by bitcoin.

That isn't an issue at all, I'm not sure why people are asserting that there is no way to purchase goods with bitcoin right now, that's been around for years.
To accept bitcoin means you are using a 3rd party to recieve fiat for the bitcoin. Those 3rd parties have fees for usage and risk/volatility mitigation. And if you pay attention to the trends, they've done insanely well.
Think of all of the gyft cards and steam games purchased for 1 bitcoin. Those $500 and $50 purchases were now all $11,000 purchases and bitpay/coinbase has 100% of those BTC.

If everyone "Hodl" bitcoin would be worthless, worth 0. In fact it would be worth -money, as it costs money to generate it.
1. Someone has to mine to generate bitcoin. 
2. Mining costs money. 
3. Someone has to sell what is mined to pay for mining.
4. If you then obtain that and "hodl," the value of bitcoin is the cost of mining it + whatever miner profit.
If that's the case, then bitcoin is grossly overpriced. 
So you best hope it isn't the case. And so, for bitcoin to be worth &gt; the cost of mining, someone needs to sell and not hodl, past miners.
For that, there needs to be demand and use cases. 
The biggest use case now (not even going to talk about crime) is stabilizing your value for a fee in a rapidly tanking economy. People who dumped savings in crypto before their economy went in the toilet (hopefully as bitcoin pumped and not dumped) came out waaaaaay ahead even after the fees.
But aside from that? Nerd hobby where people sink time into it and see where it takes them. Early adopters are royalty now and we have to deal with them as though they did something more than mine (or massively scam) when it was easy to. They have enough money and power to buy themselves a seat at a table they don't deserve to sit at, and worst of all they can obfuscate their bullshitty rise to power.

Doesn't work that way.
Right now businesses can accept bitcoin using coinbase/bitpay. 
You give coinbase/bitpay the coins, bitpay/coinbase pays the retailer in fiat. 
There is no "underselling." 
And if you want a return, as far as the retailer is concerned, you get fiat back. 
The risk is squarely on the purchaser for realizing that 1btc copy of Witcher 3 you bought was a $11,000 purchase... and coinbase and bitpay.

No they wouldn't: steam doesn't. gyft doesn't. newegg doesn't. overstock doesn't.
Accepting bitcoin is easy, there just is no point. 
Right now businesses are looking for the infrastructure to actually receive bitcoin, not use a 3rd party to immediately convert BTC into fiat, which is what they all do at the moment.
Ask anyone who's spent any amount of bitcoin for an online purchase: the ones who've raked in the money are those who are essentially converting the BTC to cash. 
If you paid 3 bitcoin for a game on steam, steam isn't the one who has the BTC, the service that converted it to cash is: bitpay.

Bitcoin's projected maximum value is "take all the money in the world and divide it by 20,999,999.9769" 
That's the ceiling. That's a lot of money, eh? 
I assure you that in 7 years of mining, plenty of miners realized gains even at early electrical costs yields. It is a trivial function to have a confidence % on bitcoin valuation in 1 month and see exactly how much hashing power you'd need to control to profit on mining, and then figure out what that cost would be to get there. 
Even the slivers that someone on a USB miner running at a yearly loss earns, eventually recoups.

If you extend your misplaced analogy, you could OC two computers and when one is close to "burning out" you lose some performance for a little bit while you replace the issue pieces and shifting load to the non-issue PC. You'd also maintain them at a predictable place and add as many components as you can, evenly paced so failures don't happen simultaneously and you lose less power. 
All of these ideas point to bitcoin as a supplement / add-on / peripheral to the current system, which gives consumers the option to be their own bank, but, able to OPT-IN to 3rd party solutions as desired. Right now, you have to opt in to the entire system to take part in any of it.
A better analogy is that the banking system is an email list that sends you boner pill notifications AND crucial healthcare / bills / whatever gov dox all in one list. You want to opt out of boner pills but your only option is all or nothing. Crypto is the option to granularly opt in / out of whatever you want.
People can choose to deliriously believe crypto "replaces money" but it is far more realistic, during this era of crypto, to solve things based on this coexistence of both, even if at some point fiat ceases to exist that point is not now.
Personally I could do without the sabre rattling, no matter the spark of anarchy or libertarian streak behind some of the core concepts at play with crypto... win gracefully if you're so sure of it.

Obviously that's an endgame scenario, but that's skipping far, far ahead. Right now the push is for crypto to be used IN LIEU OF fiat.
crypto is not a closed system yet. miners have to pay bills, spenders have to pay taxes. while it is easily possible to do so with crypto, the endpoints are still typically fiat only.
Nobody knows until an adoption threat so large happens that governments are forced to show their hand. Or reveal the true nature of their governance, as some countries have already done.

But... you're comparing a currency to a derivatives market. What sense does that make?
If you take the relative value of any one currency and compare that to derivatives it is insanely small. 
A currency can never be bigger or equivalent to a derivatives market. Nor can it's circulation be even a fraction of a country's debt. Relative to GDP the fractions are there, of course, but overall circulation? Miniscule relative to the external/internal debt.
There can be only $1 in existence but someone could have $10,000,000,000 debt just via interest or the nature of the GDP.

People can't wait for it to be at 20k, which is another doubling-ish. And that alone seems unreasonable now, but maybe at the halvening.
Or maybe it's already inflated well past halvening value since the cost to actually mine is ridiculously profitable already. It's not like 5x the mining is going to enter in between now and halvening, getting to that 10x multiplier.

holy fuck well yeah you've just opened our minds it isn't a tired, old dystopia trope to have piles of "old currency" that are valueless now that the zombie apocalypse happens.
I mean, your sentiments sound more like you're coming to terms with how money works. 
If you can't see the intrinsic value with holding value on a decentralized ledger, I dunno, go hide cash in your walls or bury silver in the backyard.
but in an environment where you can have physical property seized gosh why would a cryptographically secure store of wealth be valuable?
 When a bank can say "sorry we deleted the money so even your paper money is shit now and you can't touch your stored wealth" do you not see why having an alternate, worldwide store of wealth is valuable?
obviously when a thing increases in value the way btc has people who don't care about the intrinsic properties will invest and manipulate, but those who see it as a value store see it working as intended.
one day this much volatility will be a wet dream. The price will discover and btc will look like the basis for fiat,  ot the other way around, with how little it changes.

The thing I never understood about Craig S. Wright is that he constantly discusses being the inventor of bitcoin as an obvious stepping-stone scam to "the next thing" he's working on, but he has apparently done nothing even remotely valuable since.
Let's hit our heads with a shovel a few times and imagine that he actually invented bitcoin. So what? He would be the first to know that it isn't HIS anymore and the entire premise was to decentralize it. You know, away from a centralized author?
I know literally zero inventors, and I work in the innovation field, who make things then constantly say "I did this other old thing" in reference to it while working on, you know, the next project. The people who do that quickly dwindle away as irrelevant because they're not involved with the CURRENT innovations, they're dwelling on the past.
It's like he's not even been AROUND people who make anything consistently, they're the opposite of who and what he is.
He's on the wrong side of the table. The true innovators and inventors aren't the business developers, and I'll I've seen from what little I've skimmed from him is talking about POSITIONING bitcoin specifically.
I get a sense that if pressed, he wouldn't pass a basic aptitude test regarding cryptographic knowledge that would be necessary to formulate a product... as in, I knew more about it in 2009 than he does currently, let alone the amount of applied knowledge wherewithal to actually create a prototype or working proof of concept.

People constantly talk about the platonic ideals of the systems without mentioning that, you know, we've had the systems (never ideal) and they have these very distinct phases.
Seems like when you run the "capitalist simulator" without socialist safety nets and limitations in a democracy, with a command economy it is much different than a pseudo-free market economy or a mixed economy. the powerful few gain power exponentially while trivially suppressing those less powerful!


The problem with this is that you can make any number of metaphors to explain government/economy. 
Say there's a pie. 
People should share the pie. Hooray!
But wait, one person made the pie. Why should the other get any of it? But wait, a second person grew the ingredients for the pie, with their own investment and risk in the farm, so why shouldn't they receive a free pie? But wait, there's an industry that supports the entire infrastructure and taxpayers pay into it to support pies being made, where's their pie?
This is all so confusing. Let's have great leader just order pies to be made, and nobody gets money for them. But being great leader is hard work, so they get the first pie. Oh, and their friend. And we do this because the friend controls a party island that entertains dignitaries that gives great country it's raw resources it can't make on it's own. 
Well that's just not fair. We should all just make pies, or not, and if we want pies and there are any available we should just get them! Easily solved! But wait, one person made the pie...

assassination marketplace was a reference to the Jim Bell piece  that posited if we had an anonymous money, it would facilitate the ability to do a sort of distributed/pooled crowdsourcing of an assassination by basically saying "I think XYZ will die on 1/1/2018" and requiring a guessing fee to be accepted. And then if that did happen, presumably it is because the guesser was actually the perpetrator, and all funds would be released into that person's wallet.
The theory being that once the pooled amount of money was sufficiently worth the risk, someone would accept + carry it out.
There was one up 4-5 years ago but it was more of a shout out than anything else. The bitcoins that were placed there for various contracts never moved, but it was assumed that it was just someone implementing the Bell piece for posterity.

Yes it does - it's called posting history.
Instead of a well established history of rational discussion, you have ~20 posts in two weeks, 8 of which are defending BCash in some form.
Most of those defenses are talking about how BCash's valuation increase has been better than Bitcoin's therefore what's the problem?!
Some of those posts are trying to position BCash as relevant or a peer to BTC. That sounds awfully devious as some sort of positioning strategy -- never mind the fucktardery of using bitcoin.com and trying to be "the really real bitcoin" or whatever rhetorical shitshow.
And so, a near 50% pattern of "posts defending BCash" makes your attempts at rational discussion--don't get me wrong, your posts aren't vapid or useless or anything--overshadowed by the idea that you might have an agenda to profit from BCash.
Take your post, for example: 


This is a false parallel. People aren't merely calling BCash a scam, people have gone into vivid detail about every shady, anti-social aspect of BCash at length to warn others away from "falling for it."
Also... "most people?" Sorry but the only sources for bitcoin information were not calling bitcoin a scam. "Most people" were those who were skeptical or hostile towards the ideas, because they were rationalizing not taking the risk. Any early investor has a story about the "most people" who thought they were fucking idiots and that "it'll never work, funny money, waste of time, you're an idiot."
But if you were around forums discussing cryptographic currency, "most people" had plain data showing the potential. "Most people" don't know how bitcoin basically works, so how could they understand the potential value? "Most people" just need to figure out what banks and credit unions will allow them to trade their WeedCoins, not that perhaps the issue here is banks and credit unions should have absolutely no authority to "assess risk + suspicion" outside of reporting it to an investigative agency. In fact, "most people" don't even see the simple logic of a bank letting your shady trading continue so that investigators have more to investigate and, get this, build a case about this apparent crime. In other words: listening to "most people" is always going to average out to mundanity fueled by fear + ignorance. Listening to a curated, socially verified select few is always superior.
That has zero bearing on if you can make money from BCash. I'm totes on board that, yeah, like anything else: you can until you can't... greater fool and all that... but I guess myself, and others, draw the line in the sand with "profiting at all costs" when that means directly supporting toxic douchebags that were using their "being right about bitcoin a long time ago" to instigate a bunch of horseshit and tummy-aches. 
I personally welcome all challenges to bitcoin, as the crypto landscape is better whenever one of them wins. 
The problem is, when the agendas are as murky as they are with BCash, could the short term profiteering mean the long term compromising of the currency or ideals? If BCash "won out" and 2 weeks later were tied to mastercard and allowed purchases on Amazon while increasing in value 100,000x, would you hesitate? Or "hey, fuck it, sick gains!"
So, with BCash's agenda being murky at best, and your agenda being not so murky, it seems easy to point out your 2 weeks of input as a sign that you're here to shill the thing you can profit from more and perhaps might not care about the long term. 
What if supporting BCash meant you lose out in the "long run?" That's a force that opposes you, here.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go jerk myself off to some Ayn Rand books-on-tape as read by froggy of the lil rascals

No you don't. they could do it right now, easily, via coinbase/bitpay. They never see the btc and only recieve the value of the goods which don't change crazily.
For example someone could have bought a $10,000 computer system from newegg yesterday for 1 btc. bitpay took the btc (with a nice fee) and gave newegg the $10,000. Essentially bitpay bought your bitcoin from you + fee, and are holding the btc while giving the fiat to newegg.
And grats, they made $1,000+ on that transaction. Now imagine all of the steam, gyft, newegg etc sales all the way up?
A friend bought a PC on newegg for $4k when btc was at 1k. Bitpay made $40k on that transaction. Newegg got their $4k. etc.

I get it, but stop pretending the blockchain technologies aren't cost savings for JPM and their institutional customers.
There is a massive difference between current accounting practices and what is required from them, and the instantly searchable, auditable and traceable ledger a blockchain provides.
To put it another way, replace any of your favorite exchanges with JPMCoin's "Quorum Blockchain" concept. You SHOULD be able to instantly know where the coins are, but funny that you can't. Yet this is pushed as a feature of Quorum. 
So I'd say this is actually a step up regarding some services of, you know, some of the largest transactions that banks make. 
And with everyone on this blockchain being certified, there's 100% accountability with zero effort, governments love it!
One question I have is with a centralized blockchain... wouldn't JPM essentially be able to 51% attack itself at any moment and add/remove transactions?

It’s also not a real form (yet), it’s a draft.
The sentence itself is vague and could mean you should check “yes” if you send coin to yourself, for example.
What’s odd is that it would be for basis purposes but it has no fields for specific transactions or details. I’d expect that to expand. Checking yes without stating the nature just seems like audit filtering
As to your disingenuous question: obviously the US government wants to know, and they have made it a crime if you don’t reveal it.
There is literally no tie-in to this question otherwise, you still report taxable events as usual. They just wanted to start establishing basis so someone in 10 years can’t say “yes back in 2019 I bought in at 1/10000th of current value” like people are able to do with 2009 acquisitions

The presumption was that craig wright claims to have been one of the earliest "bitcoin traders" and traded with kleiman. profiles have come out on kleiman that paint him as possessing the skillset to be involved with bitcoin before his death.
to put it another way, the most plausible narrative from CSW is that kleiman is satoshi, kleiman died and CSW can now masquerade as the dead person because they know they're dead and noone can disprove it...
...problem with that, is their hard drive paper is a fucking joke, and there's near 0% chance bitcoin was solo created, let alone by those two wingdings.

That’s censorship. Making the distinction between “useful” and “harmful” censorship only serves as proof of censorship.
So rather than stating there’s no censorship and then describing blatant censorship justified as “for public good” just state that there is some value to the censorship.
Reddit is censored at multiple, arbitrary, levels. You would clearly defend that along the same logic but then you should also relent that it’s up to whatever moderation feels like to meet their agenda and the monolithic nature of subreddit names and the way they were claimed itelf is a form of editorialized censorship.
The irony there is that the system of content harms itself and limits the utility of it. So why? Because it is about data gathering and monetization, freedom of content is tertiary at best.
Take some of the largest noun subreddits like “music.” It’s nowhere near representing all of music, but ratherbwhat music interested demographic of the english speaking world that uses reddit considers relevant.
So here you have a major subreddit that normalizes music to white-approved, western forms.

Impossible to know. It's definitely not 0% and definitely not 100%. It's somewhere between there.
The exchanges would know best, and even that is just "how many unique accounts received bitcoin." Ideally they would know that it is legitimate but how many people have control over multiple unique accounts is still somewhat obscured.
For example if someone sets up a coinbase account for each one of their family members they might be in control of all, lets say, 5 accounts and turning what could have been 1 trade into 5.
Likewise setting up 1,000 little trades instead of 1 big one obscures the "number of trades." All that matters there is volume.

Possibly - but Kleiman could have been Satoshi, had the skillset, etc. He died and was close to Wright so Wright could be aware of this and is so ballsy about declaring he is Satoshi because he knows that it was Kleiman who cannot dispute the claim.
The problem with this idea is that others would also possibly know Kleiman's role and/or Wrights non-role.
The idea that Bitcoin was invented by a lone wolf (or even a pair of people like Wright is asserting) is 100% horseshit, especially when you see the hard drive paper they co-authored and how riddled with flaws it is, to have your OTHER big thing be as bulletproof as bitcoin vanilla was, is hilariously off.

bullshit. $X00 or $X,000 invested in 2010 is arguably more "risk" than it is today as bitcoin was worth nothing.
Hyper-early miners, yes, sure -- just run the core client and get some every so often. There are people who stopped CPU mining because it was only 50 every few days at that point, and not worth it... with early ASIC and GPU miners taking over, before pools even solidly happened.
Just because it wildly paid off doesn't mean the risk was any different. But yes, it's easy for you to just make blanket generalized statements.
I know people who stopped mining bitcoin because they were getting nothing out of it besides high electricity bills and blowing up their graphics cards. 100% "lost" resources. Obviously looking back they should have just paid cash for bitcoin, right? Or just dropped another couple hundred on another graphics card... oh, wait, anyone buying it was also taking the risk of getting ripped off. oh, wait, anyone selling it was also taking the risk of getting ripped off. oh, wait, both were risking that the valuation would never make sense.
And so on.
Is paying $1,000 for 10,000 bitcoins back then any more or less risky than $1,000 for .7 bitcoins right now? Hardly

Let alone be REPEATEDLY served the goddamn ad. And before they get any bright ideas, the answer isn't to extend the reach of big data to figure out what I want, it's to contextualize the fucking ads to the content.
Also, there are other ways to monetize their website that are adless and require zero mining. So they should do those, or realize that their userbase actually isn't really that passionate about the service/content.

1 btc is arbitrary. The value fluctuates so what is your goal, exactly? To profit from some multiplier that will happen?
So if 1btc that's $5k is tomorrow $50k, will you just hold on to that bitcoin? Or sell $45k worth to have value of $5k again?
It's just an arbitrary designation, and if you're speculating and gambling, invest what you can afford to, and ride that increase up with $1 invested, $100 or whatever amount you are comfy risking. 
The exact same thing can be said for something like Amazon stock. 10 years ago every $100 invested is now worth $1900.
20 years ago, every $50 invested is now worth $1900.
22 years ago, every $2 invested is now worth $1900.

1. if you always adhere to a true democracy the majority, no matter what cost, will always feed itself and strip the minority.
2. democracy is "weighting a dipshit's corrupt vote equally with an intelligent person's well-informed and well-meaning vote, and then weighting the aggregates by arbitrary land allotments" Awful on many vectors: how do you measure validity of a vote. what is well-meaning, is there something wrong with selfishness, can you be well-informed of misinformation. Using one vote or one set of laws for many different regions. And so on.
You will never solve those things about a democracy which are core failures of the system. All of the little petty bitchy things like "how votes work" and "the game rigging" are pointed distractions away from these flaws.

The myth is that this implies the $100 with cocaine on it was "near" or "involved" with the transaction. False. 
Unless you can show how many $100 bills that were in proximity to the cocaine and not just "these other ones had trace amounts" this is useless wank-off material for a dumb pleb public to think "bank bad."
It's also an interesting forensic idea to decontaminate bills to try and use the contaminated bills to find sources. Oh wait! The place that the transaction occurs is equally arbitrary as the residue! Oops!
@_date: 2019-04-17 16:33:59
first of all, the myth is that the proximity of a $100 bill to cocaine matters. 
If 1 $100 bill is used to snort coke and that bill then contaminates 10,000 other $100 bills who gives a shit? The stories all conflate "see all money is dirty" via insinuation that the residue on the bills has to do with proximity to something illegal.
secondly yeah, that samplesize is pathetic (you could have done 1/5 of the amount of bills from any place and done 5x more places and gotten different results, herp derp) and it states that the bills came into contact with other bills. Again, so what?
The myth is that the $100 was in actual relevant "drug deals."

No it does not. 
It's pretty simple that those ideas are 100% mutually exclusive: the technology that makes credit/debit cards easy to use is only possible because of how centralized those networks are.
There is no way to use bitcoin without a 3rd party / intermediary unless you are willing to take on risk of security on your end or devaluation on the receiving end. THAT is why it is valuable: it doesn't REQUIRE the 3rd party.
So you're lamenting that there aren't more 3rd party solutions for bitcoin to increase UX and ease of use, but nobody would bother with that shit when it interrupts the stranglehold they have on the marketplace.
This is why the "best solutions" you see that don't involve risk, involve an instant fiat conversion. And the irony there is, there's no fucking point to doing that since you are still putting the powers that be as the necessary middleman, and it takes extra work to convert fiat into coin.
The best case scenario is using those "in between" systems where you pick things to purchase from a site and place orders, pay the bitcoin and SOMEONE ELSE purchases the goods with cash for your bitcoin.
Other than that, we're looking at some sort of "swipe the reader" setup where a company insta-converts to fiat, which is the same as the previous scenario except all it is the equivalent of THAT COMPANY just buying your bitcoin.
It will never be easier to use than the current system, and it is harder because you have to convert to it in the first place.
I forsee the next phase in mainstream adoption for bitcoin might be that certain things are always fiat paid, where bitcoin becomes the defacto barter / smaller business currency.
The problem with that is simple, if I run a business in most jurisdictions I must generate fiat to keep the business going at some point, even if it is just for taxes.

weird, you omitted the "hard earned income" part of your explanation
also weird, you don't address that a central bank "creating money" is balanced by debt being paid off which is essentially "deleting money."
I'm not exactly sure what you're proposing, that as more and more population is added to an economy that the money supply should stay fixed? 
When $5 is created by central bank and that $5 is given to a commercial bank which then loans out the $5 for someone to build a house and that person pays out the $5 to a bunch of people to make the house happen, but then loses their job and can't pay their bills, the $5 didn't "dissappear," but the debt is still outstanding. What do you propose happens? No more loans?

And some are people who saw gains from $0.11 to $15,000-$19,000, and have faith that it will never drop so low that a short anywhere between 5-10k isn't really that risky. With gains that large you could liquidate not even 20% of your holdings and play a short game and still end up thousands of percentage points ahead.

I remember some horseshit post about how Mozilla/firefox had a bitcoin donation "A/B test" and their [really shitty methodology]( and [rationalization]( was that by having the bitcoin link they were losing money, because even though the people who used the link gave more, less people overall donated with the link in place, citing "user experience friction."
I mean, [look at that link's positioning]( Fuck you, idiots. If a student trying to get an associates degree would do that as a UX 101 project assignment, they'd get a C-.
And then they required email address? Fuck you again, idiots.
I pointed out that their placement was fucking stupid, so of course the friction was a net negative. They were treating it as a "special / other" method instead of just one of a few choices like archive.org is doing.
I think we know the real answer here, and it has to do with foundational support from entities interested in bitcoin not succeeding. /adjusts_tinfoil_hat
Seriously tho, design the checkout properly and, get this, remove the friction and there won't be any.
It's about as stupid as saying "If people don't have discover card it is adding friction to allow discover card to be a choice" when you're allowing paypal.

Not really. It's a few shit actors shilling b'cash, they never went away, they just change their rate of spamming.


There is no spam, there is just using. As long as there is incentive to use bitcoin shittily, it will be used shittily. it doesn't mean anything needs to change.


it doesn't require "technical people" to understand that raising the blocksize creates an incentivized arms race, where the more you increase the blocksize, the more centralized and less feasible it is for you to store the chain on a tiny drive which gives those who would inflate it more power.
If ONE b'cash adherent would diagram out this obvious inflation, and propose a stopping point or cap on it, or even a rate of increasing, they'd have more people's sympathy. Instead they have a chain built entirely on the premise of forking pre-existing bitcoin holdings for free money, and making use of BaNnEd features with their shitty asicboost backing.
But really, it is in those adherents' best interests to just spam and slow adoption for bitcoin while treating their unused, falsely valued chain very delicately.
If bitcoin went away tomorrow and there was only b'cash, the spam would stop, negating the need for bigger blocks but at any moment the spam could resume creating bigger and bigger blocks and pushing out many nodes... And I bet all of the features they resist now would immediately be implemented.

@_date: 2017-04-13 13:36:31
Your statement doesn't make any sense at all.
Miners ARE in a position where assessment of protocol upgrades is the final say. THIS IS HOW BITCOIN WORKS. 
They will change their mind when the valuation slumps to the point that they will not support bitcoin as is and embrace the change that is proposed by the network. The second it is more profitable to them to bail on their position, based on whatever speculation (or immediate environment) they will.
Otherwise, the other option is to have a network where more miners agree with you instead of disagree with you.
But yes, piss and moan more. It is one way to devalue bitcoin to the point that miners change their mind. Oh wait, what's this, it's doing fine regardless? 
To put it another way, say you are generating $10,000 every day happily. You don't want any changes to this, you like this position. Now a divine source starts kicking you in the balls every week. You're OK with this. It happens to other people and hey the value increases. $50,000 a day. Wow! But the kicks keep coming. Accelerating. Every day. Every hour. Ouch! But still, $50,000 a day ... hold out as long as you can, right?
Then, the market starts slumping. At what daily monetary valuation would you stop receiving an always painful kick in the balls? 
now replace kick in the balls with "it costs me $1000/day to make the $50,000/day" At what valuation would you stop your practices? Maybe you never will, because you're in it for the long haul and even a fraction of a bitcoin is worth it at any cost today.
So you hold on forever, but bitcoin becomes more and more useless. transactions take too long, the noise doesn't allow any other layers to function properly as well... altcoins become more valuable and people jump ship. Still cool because ONE DAY IT WILL BE BACK TO NORMAL and you'll have all those "under duress" coins in a time you created markets that had others squeezed out of bothering.
In other words, the selfish miner is a concept that is the backbone of bitcoin. Consensus of everyone else is the opposing force to pose the backbone.

depends on how cynical you are about how much people spend outside of what they should comfortably risk, I suppose. 
I imagine a non-trivial amount of people who bought at 10k on the way down "because psychology" is just waiting for it to be (10k+fees+taxes) to be done with it.
Likewise 9, 8, 7, 6 and whatever other round numbers all the way up to 19
Also, around 50% of the bitcoin in existence was mined sub $50. So I just pretend that all sales that aren't miners liquidating at market value are just people cashing out on their $1 bitcoins for a still massive gain.

Nobody is switching to team "centralization is good" because some twat is being a twat and someone else making fat profits off of the lesser fools uses their power to be an advocate. You're writing off a whole heck of a lot of people who don't care what crypto's current price value is.
Never mind all of the people actually around back then, not scammers pretending they were and offering no proof, who would still be ridiculously rich, even wealthy, even if btc lost 50% of it's current value.

give it time and it'll get there. just like we don't use pennies as the unit for large costs, we don't use satoshi (and i'd wager never will).
I don't think the smallest divisible unit will be what we use as "1 bitcoin" simply because transaction fees would be some fraction of whatever smallest unit is landed on.
further, i don't think bitcoin itself is the endgame for people using it, there will be more accessible L2 solutions that allow smaller units past satoshi to be traded.


If right now a banana is $0.20, that would be 10,300 = .20 ... * 5
51,500 = $1. So why not just say 1 bitcoin = 51,500 satoshi and essentially set $1 = 1btc if you're seeking parity.
Past that, I'd just set 1btc = 1000 or 10000 satoshi and that leaves wiggle room for transaction costs, and be done with it. 
Again, all of this seems a bit pointless to me regarding adoption when the people who will adopt it are math literate and will hide bitcoin behind 2nd layer solutions regardless: let the 2nd layer handle UX / optics.

I was just pointing out why Bitcoin's not as "buzzworthy" as it was when it saw the astronomical gains.


This is part of the buzz diminishing. That is the exciting part, but you're telling half, or maybe 1/3, of the story: the missing parts being 1) obtaining bitcoin and 2) storing and maintaining it.
The number one follow-up question to any initial discussion being "Wait, how do I get bitcoin" followed by "Wait, so I buy bitcoin with 'real' money and then use the bitcoin... why bother?" and then maybe somewhere down the line "Wait, how is this different than my bank account?"


This is also, still, a problem: how many people in the world are actually well equipped to maintain their own wallet?
Also, it is fodder for an argument when bitcoin is reduced to "cash on my phone" as the positive side of things is that you do have complete access to the entire ledger of bitcoin, however pseudo-anonymous it can be... the only real negatives to this are the powers that be are powerful and will resist this disruption at least until they can capitalize on it as needed.
The bitcoin userbase is a spectrum, on one end you have those interested in it in a purely theoretical sense and on the other you have those who want to use it. And in between you have the hoarders, scammers, altruists, capitalists, idealists ... regulators, and so on in so many configurations.
I personally think bitcoin is equally exciting as it was at its fever pitch, and can only hope there are people looking into making it more robust. I'm just a customer / consumer of it at this point.

fractional reserve banking has nothing to do with how central banking "must work."
money is created by giving a loan to a commercial bank or buying financial assets.
this could exist without a fractional reserve requirement from a commercial bank.
For example, all deposits and "people's money" could be required to be full reserve, but the loans from a central bank could be 100% risked. 
The sad part is this would not only be feasible to do (trivial) it would also still yield profit for banks. Just not as much to pay for the 1% lifestyles that banks create.

Think about where you "hear of" Bitcoin today, and why you do.
Vast majority of the news have to do either with another scam/problem/issue or someone starting something that has suspicious context.
Remember when there was a huge push to make it consumer / user friendly? That's basically evaporated, in large part because the ripest target is that "new person needing help."
I have personally felt, from the beginning, that this entire thing is a beta test for something infrastructurally bigger, and the fact that it got traction out in the real world was merely providing a series of test cases of what can happen and not actually some sort of "new plebian money."
Of course it would explode into all out mass-scale mining where a single person couldn't compete. 
Of course a substantial amount of "the story" will always be concerned with the crime it enables: what gets more clicks "Exposing The Shadowy Internet Money used to fund Child Slavery" or "Nerd Theorizing About Hard Fork Ramifications."
Thrill seekers have stopped gumming up the works with their daily market valuation obsession (probably because majority of the places that actually provide some sort of valuation have all proven to be rigged in some manner or another). 
The Libertarian Privacy Champions have quieted down, likely because they look like the rogues at this point as people have directly opted-in to 3rd party regulation, taxation, and all those good things that aren't "required" but man do they help out when push comes to shove.
I dunno, was it more exciting when someone met someone else in person to sell headphones, the guy accepted the bitcoin and walked away without giving anything? Ho ho!

You seem to miss the point of how averages work.
Transaction per second involves volume capacity. You can move the decimal point over as much as you want via value, but that doesn't change how many people can realistically buy coffee with bitcoin without layer2 in a block window.
The last time I looked at the stats, bitcoin can do ~8 transactions a second where visa does ~1,600 (ceiling estimates being ~56,000).
So no, you've made a poo post and sorta missing the entire point of Layer2 which is to address the scalability issue central to bitcoin. It's partly why there are philosophic splits in how to address the scalability (and what impact that has on centralization via size problems).

volume is still way, way down. look at TRADING volume. 
"segwit batching" is not a solitary thing. there's segwit, there's batching, as separate entities as well.
batching could have happened without segwit. that started well before this current wave of segwit adoption.
segwit could happen without exchanges batching.
It's all 3.
Besides, who gives a flying fuck about overall transactions? I could set up a script to spam thousands of transactions to myself to make the transactions look more robust.
All that matters is trading volume, and that's a trivial stat to look up.

Wrong. Crushing means YOU are reducing something else in size. The thing being crushed is not crushing. If bitcoin is “crushing” it means it is reducing the size/value of the market and growing in size.
Crushing in terms of economic movement means gaining, not losing.
crushing in terms of how well something is doing means doing well, not doing poorly
The phrase “I am crushing” always refers to the infatuation and never refers to “being crushed.”
The only clarification is that OP didn’t say the actual phrase “Bitcoin is crushing IT.”

the point of it being deflationary is so you willingly funnel your fiat into crypto, at which point the powers that be have what they always wanted: a 100% digital currency. 
They will legislate and regulate that you "must" register all addresses, and be verifiable, with the penalty for dealing with unregistered / taint addresses being the inability to use them on the "main" channels.
No business will end up accepting BTC/L2currency from any coins that has a known taint address in their history. They might even do something ballsy like allow you to just keep some or all of the "taint coins" as long as you snitch on the person who used them.
Slowly this will funnel all BTC into issuing entities (centralized banks / govs / services).
The best part of this, is just like cocaine dollars, once an address is considered "taint" they can add a whole spectrum of validation to that address and do all sorts of nifty things to filter any tainted coins out of circulation.
The whole point of many of those dumbfuck casinos and tumblers is to try and spread the taint around so much that you couldn't "really" do anything without disrupting the entire system. Unfortunately it is rather trivial to say "we know that someone sent tainted coins to one, we consider this a money laundering device, all coins to and from it = taint."
You hear a lot of bravado about how "bitcoin can't be stopped" but convincing legislators that that's literally only true for criminals is going to take a lot of doing. They don't give a shit that their laws stifle good actors if they also reduce effectivity of the bad actors by some tiny fraction of a percent. It's job well done, as far as they're concerned.

It's funny because businesses are very simple things. If it seems too good to be true, it is.
There was a very high profile bitcoin trader in bitcointalk forums, I still reference his posts on there. He had a website that flat out said "I will buy your bitcoins." That's it. He wasn't selling them. Then someone else on the forums ratted him out to authorities and he had to stop since he didn't have an MSB licence. Even though he was basically saying "I'll buy whatever bitcoin you have for sale." I...guess buying things is a business? OK.
His posts on bitcointalk were great, intelligent, well written and authoritative. He's a nominee of the "is maybe satoshi!?" club because of his libertarian values without being nutty. And he did such a great service to the community that was sullied by jealous scammers wanted to control things. Aw!
That's where the simplicity ends. He then started a "legit" MSB and got all this funding for it. I think over half a million dollars, at the time, all in bitcoin. it was supposed to be a simple MSB but now there was hemming and hawing and odd complexities about the money transfers, routing, etc. That investment is worth a massive multiple now...
and then literally disappeared. no more posts. people defended him, i mean he was the BEST OF THE BEST and a true legitimizing force for bitcoin. 
I know he was purchasing thousands of BTC at a ceiling of $50 back then. Even when it surged, 1/2 million of btc is a windfall...
So after going through that whole bullshit, it is basically insane to trust any "next big thing." Especially coming from a DeSeRtHaCkErBrO who is narcissistic enough to be so public about their ID in the space while dealing with the grey markets. 
I get it when some cryptomillionaire 18 year old does it is the freckles and blush, aw shucks, new face of crypto (cia plants, all of them) and use their real names and get hacked "publicly" hee hee, but someone so doxable that points straight towards their "Vape Shoppe" that clearly peddles illegal drugs?

No, you can't.
Alice mines a block. Bob takes over that address. Bob didn't mine the block but Bob controls the address.
AFAIK there is no way to prove you mined a block. Maybe if you had video footage of your client mining it while you were in the frame giving the thumbs up or something, or notarized IP address / traffic records from your ISP...
There is just proving that you control the address (directly or indirectly) that received a coinbase transaction. You can do this by providing the key as you've detailed. People have tried to use the "see I'm going to transfer .00012345 to prove it's mine" but that could be them indirectly controlling it just that one time, etc.

485,188 mined since July 17. You got 1.
Hash power went from 6.6Mth/s to 25.6Mth/s so midpoint assuming linear growth TH/s would be 16.1M to get 485k btc. 
To get 1 btc, that puts you at ~33.18 TH/s 
an antminer at 14TH/s eats up 1372 kwH.
2.37 antminers to get 33.18 = 3251 kwH
Lets average your cost per kw hour to .1
$ 2,847.88 power cost / year with an up front investment of ~$8-9k for 2.37 miners to basically break even unless it spikes substantially over $10k, at which point you're running deficit anyway.
But yes, based on your .1 kw/hour cost not sure where someone is paying AT let alone OVER the price on this chart. Smells like bullshit to me.
Never mind that if you had just spent the $10k investment on BTC itself in july17, you'd have 4 bitcoins and not 1, 300% profit instead of break even.
Instead you have 1, and will likely never see a second. Year 2, considering that same hashrate growth would be a massive loss so you never really get to enjoy "paying off" the miners, by the time you do that, you're no longer making money with them.
That's the problem with hobby mining, the people selling the miners would just mine themselves if it was actually profitable to do so. ( I went through the same thing, yes, it's fun cool, but shrug). Of course, all this assumes you're not making use of "freely available" power or "borrowing" hashing from wherever ;P~~

You can have blockchains that are not cryptographically secure, you can use cryptography that is insecure to create blockchains.

Hell, they wouldn't even need to come up with 20 million TH/s since they'd literally force the difficulty downward as they spike the profitability into the dirt and smaller entities switch from spending money on mining to buying the btc directly.

The worst thing is that the entire network becomes useless: all mining done on the "honest" branch becomes lost and there is a potential for a snowball effect of miners shutting down their mining because they are at 100% loss. The &gt;50% chain could then spam empty blocks and lock in their advantage or disruption.

Sorry, but, no. The core problem with any ICO is the assumption that it will not be so obscure that it won't be 51% attackable. There are plenty of weaselly solutions to this regarding premining or centralized distribution with promised returns...
You could invent a blockchain tomorrow and if someone with a big enough farm was so inclined they could easily take over the chain with the proper access. Not to forget that they could also control most if not all of the token moving forward.
The simple fact that it isn't monetarily advantageous for someone to mine these new chains isn't enough of a deterrent.
That is one feature of bitcoin that I don't think any other coin in existence will ever have: bitcoin's hashing growth is 1 to 1 with the technological advances and swelling of mining pools / rigs so there was at least some semblance of balance + lack of overpowering possible at every step of the way.
I think that's a suppressive force for any new coin and always a negative valuation, regardless of what the token is "backed by" (usually promise of a future service or value).

Not people who want to see it bust.
Regarding speculators, 100% of people who were there in the beginning thought "this can only go up in value." Since, you know, it was worth $0. In fact it was worth &lt;0$ because of the cost associated with mining (solo mining on your cpu, lol, so expensive).
If you look at early theoretical maximum, we're talking "replacing all money in the world" levels of maximums, we're nowhere near it. This sort of calculation isn't speculation. It's stating fact: as X% of the world's money is replaced by crypto, crypto is worth Y$. Lets pretend some kooky government gathers enough BTC and says "hey, people of Kookeece, we took your money ious back and instead replaced it with bitcoin." What would you say happens to valuation? Anything?
And it isn't speculation to assert that once that knowledge gets out to mainstream money/government, they'll buy in at a ridiculously low price. Or create services that essentially "buy your bitcoin." Which is all those payment processors are, they're buying your bitcoin and paying for whatever shit you're wasting it on with their own fiat. 
So, we've slowly watched bitcoin centralize towards these bogus services that essentially are gathering up as much bitcoin as possible. They then sell at opportune times to force more people to sell off, and then gobble those up at a premium. 
I mean, the US Gov is actively selling bitcoin. So they clearly have no problem with it as long as they have a stranglehold on the entities that are purchasing it. I doubt a winner is going to be a dirt rave cypherpunk anonbro who raised the cash from their St. Kitts online crypto poker website.

The problem with generalizations ascribed to large groups of people is that you can never substantiate them without making an ad populum fallacy. Who cares what "most people" thought if they weren't right?
and so... "The sentiment amongst the crypto community" is fluff BS.
The bit i responded to was "insider trading in crypto." This is VERY MUCH a problem of centralization. Coinbase is centralized, thus insider trading in crypto is an issue.
The people bitching about insider trading don't give a shit about your apparent "crypto community." 
They care when centralizing forces are supported (by unprovable entities, gov? early whales?) and then take advantage of their position.
The bottomline is you cannot have a decentralized exchange that deals with fiat without some sort of API blessing/token that banks provide. That's it. At that moment, there would literally be no such thing as an entity that will "buy bitcoins for / from you." You'd just fluidly exchange between whatever database line item you wanted to. $/DOGE/BTC/etc.
In short, my point is that coinbase IS centralized AND regulated and if they're going to dick around on both sides of the fence they shouldn't be surprised when they're pushed out of one side or trapped on the other.

And we should take advice from people like you who misuse the term "money."
Do you know the difference between money and currency? Money by definition REQUIRES someone else to have control, that's what makes it money. There needs to be an entity on the other side of money that guarantees future value. Otherwise it is just currency.
The world is NOT the wild west because the wild west had lots and lots and lots of currency out there that was disguised as money (gosh, that sounds a lot like... the crypto landscape. If you don't believe me I have a new shitcoin i'd like to sell you for real cheap). THIS is why entities fought for control of a centralized bank, to eradicate anyone who wanted to from making IOU notes as their own money (then getting shot or simply running away and all that money is worth nothing).
Magic The Gathering Online Exchange being a scam is hilariously obvious. This is why bitcoin is the wild west: you could NEVER pull that level of scam off with any matured money or financial instrument in the US. In fact, they specifically didn't if you would bother to look up any of the Magic the Gathering Online Exchange legal issues in the US.
But you could, and they did, in Japan.

this is not true because any crypto that uses the same hardware can be seen as mutations of the same coin. So one getting 51ed because of waning popularity is really just the greater blob of that hardware devouring a lesser blob. It’s also notable that once a coin is 51ed it’s essentially worthless.
All crypto that can use any specific hardware to mine it should be considered part of the same entity, in a heirarchy based on fiat value.
All of the best intentioned philosophy for a coin means nothing if a technologically inferior but more valuable coin can flick its wrist and destroy it via shifting mining over for an attack.

it isn't really "one trader." It was an entire exchange that went tits up... hundreds, if not thousands of pooled resources being sold off.
[And he can do this 9x over again, yea?](
So, buckle in. Because he can. And it didn't plunge to single digits overnight. Plenty of people would put in buy orders at even $100 or $1000 to the point that exchanges / services couldn't even handle the surge.
Question is, who the fuck would sell at those points?
The part that everyone's missing is that this whale has been dormant. All those BTC he's got are a profit at anything over what, 4-500$? And bulk of that would be even 250+?
An amazing stat would be to know what every single BTC is actually valued at. ie, when you bought 1 btc, what was it worth?
I think a gross minority is worth &gt; $10k. Not even a small fraction of all BTC was gained at that price point. 1/2 of the bitcoin in existence was mined at &lt;50$... obviously some of it has been sold and resold upwards, but how much?
And then there's all the people using btc via payment processors. newegg, steam, gyft, overstock... most of that was wasted as the peak of that use was well before current valuation. but those processors, their average cost per btc has got to be crazy, crazy low.

Bank's reply: TLDR
You didn't really point out the completely fair and valid reasons banks will not support crypto: 
1. They gain nothing by allowing its use. 
2. They increase customer support needs by allowing its use.
3. They are likely barred from allowing usage via credit card requirements (where is the open letter to VISA, et al.?)
4. They will be able to enter into crypto at any point, and have so much capital they could easily dominate the market even with late entry. 
A single major bank - lets say top 100 banks worldwide - could raise the funds to basically purchase every BTC that's available for the next 10 years. Hell, governments could do the same. 
It would be remarkably cheap to purchase and destroy crypto adoption for a few decades, plenty of time for regulation to favor the big entities that are "being attacked." Govcoin + Chasecoin could then dominate with ease.

The only way to prevent this is that security is cheaper and more powerful than any potential overnight gain of processing power.
Of course I'd LOVE to believe that however far we are "publicly" with QC is really how far any government is with QC, but I think that's bullshit meant to give a false sense of security.

explain who wins:
person 1: income taxed, receives btc. spends btc on necessities: capital gains taxed. 
person 2: income taxed, received fiat. spends fiat on necessities: much smaller state tax. puts rest into btc
or you:
person 3: living in a smouldering, abandoned bomb shelter, stealing wifi with welding goggles on and evading taxes while paying for your bills with black market gift cards paid for with tumbled crypto
spoiler: person 1, who received fiat, has MORE btc than the person who received btc and got double slammed with taxation. 
The bottomline is if you are spending ANY btc, you are losing money in the long run. This is an unavoidable fact, you can't say "I only use BTC" and "I'm hodling" ... pick one
true hodling is maximizing your crypto while minimizing your fiat. but not eradicating fiat overall, because taxation and using fiat is STILL CHEAPER THAT TRIGGERING TAX EVENTS WITH BTC FOR MUCH OF THE DEVELOPED WORLD.
Now, good on you if you're in a "btc is tax free" paradise. But realize that those sorts of havens are being set up as honeypots to trap the criminals who would take advantage of it.

Because last I checked:

To expand on this:
NEVER follow a link out of or to any bitcoin related website (reddit forums, anything) without running things in a virtualbox/sandbox environment that ideally has absolutely no contact or overlap with cookies, other web traffic or your wallet environment... including a remotely similar IP address if possible.
This includes blogs, "reputable sites," links out to homebrew apps.
The exploits going around have been embedded in these sites AS WELL AS advertisements and other embeds that the site owner might not even be aware of.
It sounds like a drag but as soon as you separate this sort of browsing as much as possible it is actually about as convenient as opening a new browser window.
The goal is not only to avoid direct malware/attacks/infection but also to not allow these sites to form any sort of profile that would make targeting you easier: the biggest being IP address, but any other vectors like usernames / passwords or your browser itself as browsers leave rather unique fingerprints on any site that scrapes lots of data from the session info (fonts installed, certain plugins, cookies, etc). 
Regarding some website that someone's sharing -- it may not even be malicious via the author. Someone getting traction with a website on a public forum like reddit becomes a target itself and will easily be focused on for exploitation + invasion from bad actors. The odds are in favor of someone creating/running an app or site is focused on front-end engineering but completely oblivious to backend engineering and the link between the two leading to poor front-end security practices. Of course the worst case scenario is that the site was flat out developed as some sort of malware itself.
I would be equally concerned with this sort of profiling (which can lead to real-life information being gained) as a malware to digitally exploit your machine.
And those crypto-egos out there that insist on publicly revealing personal information in a show of "internet credibility" ... well, good luck to you.

jesus christ ... hire an editor. Some of the writing on the site is completely indecipherable. you can't be sloppy when talking about these sorts of things, and the uneven writing makes everything sounds hesitant/unsure and basically every person in there guilty as fuck.


Huh? The affadavit goes into much more detail about that. You add nothing but confusion.


He handled 2.4 million dollars. LOL, without a license. What the hell does your narrative mean? Think of how much BTC that would be, between 2013/15?
You claim he "followed KYC" laws... no he didn't. He requested that WU get personal info so he could interview them. That sounds like an LEO check as much as anything else. 
And TV TOYZ, LLC... lol @ selling cable descramblers and then obviously laundering the money with bitcoin. Gosh, my cable descrambling product made $0, you know, I just did it as a hobby. It was all this bitcoin peddling that made the $100k+ profits. \
Rather than defending these shitbrains, you should be trying to assert that these people are the EXCEPTIONS.
If you think less regulation is coming, rather than more, you're flat out insane. they will never suddenly remove MSB requirements for crypto in the US, for example. They will be adding definition of crypto and more specific legislation. This specificity will not "loosen" crypto's presence. 
A friend works in D.C., and every single thing floated to talk about crypto comes down to 2 things: \ is "how would this law change my donations" and \ "how would this law enable crime." No politician in their right mind would vouch for something that could be pinpointed as, [as Bill Gates put it in his AMA, a technology that directly CAUSES deaths](
All that this would do is shift any scale to registered brokerages (good luck with that on a personal level). The laws regarding "how much is too much selling" ARE INTENTIONALLY VAGUE so that they can investigate you without a clear "hey I'm reaching the trigger/flag/investigation limit." There are specific numbers out there with # of trades over certain # of days, and the hilarious thing is how easy it would be trade more than that to your friends for nothing, ie, i send more quickpays via my bank a month than the limit on crypto trades to be considered a "business."
again, just so TPTB can investigate. 
And if you think they're going to drop the hammer on things that aren't profitable to them... lol... when you state they "just want an easy win" you're implying that someone is obviously guilty. You're neglecting to mention that these obviously guilty people are setting up precedents towards gov legislation. So yes, bitcoiners are cable descrambler peddlers, money launderers for hash oil dipshits, and the ub3r l33t token system of the digiMafia. Zzz.
And again, my problem here isn't with the overall message: sure, abolish the bitlicense, ok: it is ridiculously expensive for just anyone to do. And that's because of capitalism corrupting the government.
It's that you're pinpointing cases that, even without a bitlicense, would trigger all sorts of suspicions and are more of a gallery of abuses than "see, this could happen to you due to bitlicense laws."

There are 500,000 bitcoin addresses right now (down from 1 million plus in January)
There are 2.1 quadrillion units possible, total. 5.6/7 of all bitcoins have already been mined. The amount of "dead coins" will forever be negligible, because if there was ever a "shortage" a L2 or sidechain would be deployable to act as subdivisions without even a new fork... just like LN, which already allows you to subdivide further.

yearly lows is an equally vapid metric because it could have been from one person’s dump and averaged much higher than the peak low.
Imagine a song: you don’t state “the song was quiet” because there is some tiny number of samples at -inf dB, nor is a song loud because you digitally clipped a sample here and there at peak dB. 
this is why decent speakers output are not measured in only peak RMS
Any decent scatterplot based slope would NOT be altered much by outliers like low/high spikes.
You could get to the same valuation conclusion by simply truncating the bottom 20 and top 20% of the days averages. In fact I’d assert you need to because volume is trivially gamed by those willing to put up scam exhanges OR eat txfees and spam coins to themselves
never mind that the people “most required to sell” are miners, and when they were selling at 10-20k they made all their costs for the next few years and do not need to sell

well again it comes down to timing.
bitcoin had one thing that no other coin has: a gestation period where it was out in the wild, functioning, before there was any chance of interference or lopsided early distribution: it was the only coin.
The people who were around back then could easily be a small handful of people who control near 50% of the coins, total. But they didn't.
Nowadays, all of the "this is the new awesome technology" type coins have a completely unfair, lopsided early distribution system. Premines, ICOs, buy-ins, etc., and it totally gets in the way of any of the presumed benefits it might have.
On one hand, different coins are reinventing the wheel. On the other hand, bitcoin is a humongous, monolithic stone wheel where other coins might add rubber or lightweight alloys, or be far more appropriate for different roads.
The main problem I see is that other coins are trying to fix problems with bitcoin that don't exist yet (and never will exist) as their "niche." Rather than realizing bitcoin is going to be the backbone for a world's public ledger with layers on top of it, they're making their own, flimsier and susceptible channels to both stand on their own via public facing adoption AND serve as a variety of backbones.
The main metaphor I can think of is bitcoin is the fiber backbone line that connects cities, states or countries. Other coins are trying to run that to everyone's doorstep without caring how inefficient that is and stating "see bitcoin can't do this." 
The other aspect is the true anonymity of other networks, which is great, but good luck getting those legalized when the government finally catches up on their crypto literacy.

Well, swap out "financial inclusivity" where those who are wealthy have 0 problems with banks to "technological inclusivity" where those who are not adept with technology or even have basic access to it are marginalized.
What people seem to misrepresent is that inclusivity can be increased, sure, but there are natural filters to it that flat out exclude or obsolete people. 
The industrial revolution marginalizing crafts, the technological age of the 70s-90s excluding the human element in industry: those things are improvements to systems that by definition "fail to provide" for the laborers that were once essential.
A good documentary is the last days of the NYT using the manual layout/editing process for outputting papers. With a computer, overnight... they went from requiring dozens of people to physically output a paper to a computer replacing all of them.
So, the current largest roadblock is the user themselves. There are people who don't utilize or trust current digital banking, they're not going to leapfrog from checks and cash into cryptocurrency.

You have to imagine a future where intermediaries don't profit from necessities of human existence, then crypto makes sense.
I want to exchange value to purchase things without someone getting a cut of it. It's really that simple.
Everything you're bringing up has to do with either the early, formative stages of any technology or the resistance to the ideal use-case by existing power structures. You could apply your logic and sentiment with any technology that is more efficient than a current technology, especially when that current technology is very profitable.
If you think that cutting down trees and using dying and printing technology to make "paper tokens" is superior or more efficient than digital tokens, then argument over.
Otherwise, you realize that a 100% digital system is more efficient.
Now, if you think that a digital system needs to be centralized and controlled by a for-profit entity, then argument over.
Otherwise, you realize that a 100% decentralized system is more efficient.
All your comments on valuation are pointless. People adhered to bitcoin when it was $0. You're not impressing anyone by lamenting that the volatility in an early price discovery phase that is 100% community driven is a "bad thing." 
If I shit on a piece of paper and people drive the price up to $20k for that piece of paper, then it falls to $6k ... your concern shouldn't be that "it would be better if it stayed at $20k or increased." It's arbitrary based on market demand, no matter what. 
What I believe -- and there is evidence that "many" believe -- is that bitcoin could be worth $0.01 and it would still be the necessary evolution of value exchange.

since everyone is hyping the fuck out of this nonsense, here's some REAL info:
1. you can only move BTC out of cash, you cannot move BTC into cash.
2. you can only buy BTC from cash (at a % loss from basically every other exchange).
3. you cannot use the cash debitcard or get a realtime valuation of $$$ to use with the BTC you bought from cash. You'd always have to sell it first to add to your "cash" (at a % loss, again).
4. You must have a debit card to use this app. You could link a bank account, but that's apparently only for withdrawals. You can only "add cash" to it via a linked debit card. 
5. So, to recap, you'd have to not only cover the % loss from buying the bitcoin, you'd also have to cover the % loss from selling it back to cash before you can ever "use" it within cash.  They clearly have some sort of direct arbitrage where they make money off of every single BTC transaction bought or sold at any pricepoint.
6. In other words, you are not USING the bitcoin, you're just buying from some corporation that hoarded bitcoin at a premium and selling back to them, at again, a premium. 
7. The only sane use of this (partially sane, that is) is to buy on cash and move it out to a different wallet. Except why on earth would you ever do that, they have the exact same regulations that other exchanges do, with a bigger fee. 
8. They obscure this "fee" by showing you one valuation of BTC derived from some sort of mystery bullshit, but when you purchase you do not receive the amount you bought, you receive it minus this cut. This is borderline misleading as it should be showing you the amount you'd be receiving for what you're paying for BEFORE the transaction occurs.
9. This is essentially a glorified localbitcoins app wank, where the seller is saying they'll buy/sell all bitcoins at X% off of whatever some exchange is offering, oh but you can only sell the bitcoins you bought from the seller back to them. Wow, really? Gosh, thanks!

Nah: 
If you sell something online and the money goes into your account via quickpay or sits in your paypal account, you still "made fiat."  A friend runs a business and hasn't seen physical "real fiat" for almost a decade. The difference is liquidity and access for external use which... is up to you.
The only bullshit here is that exchanges aren't fully featured to the point that they're integrated with your bank account rapidly. 
If chase opened an exchange, you could instantly transfer your bank account fiat to crypto. And back again. And use that fiat with their debit card. Etc. There'd be no difference. The various exchanges have to initiate transfers, which cause fees, and trigger delays of access.
 
Your $$$ is in a database on someone's KeWlTrAdInGWeBsItE with no direct way of spending it. That's the issue of the website. If that website never held fiat and always required transaction to a bank account, you'd agree that you had access. Just because the site is limited regarding your liquidity or access to "physical real fiat (lol?)" doesn't mean shit regarding "if you gained or not." 
The bottomline is that those tools are easily available, but you chose not to use them due to either the benefit from rapidity of converting that fiat database entry back into crypto quickly for trading... or naivete of "doesn't countises, no take-backsies"... or both.

you’re missing a major component of this: timing.
bitcoin could have been easily dead in the water at both cpu to gpu transition and gpu to asic transitions.
the people who coded the gpu miners kept it to themselves until they were the top holders, and they didn’t want to hurt the system that they were trying to profit from.
same exact thing happened with early asics: the people selling them were largely scammers using the purchases to fabricate the hardware and just mine with them but not so much that they damaged the network.
now? asic mfgs could not easily attack via hoarding asics without having a goal of destroying the network... I’m fairly certain a black budget gov could perform this attack at will

Oh, I'm sure they're a fucking authority on anything.
All they did was an electricity analysis which is idiotic, as you can subsidize electricity usage... or reduce those costs via profit sharing. Especially if you're using electricity already at high volumes. Thus it is easy for heavy industry or mfg to pivot to bitcoin mining as it is more efficient use of kw/h bills.
But yes, some random asshole running rigs 24/7 in their basement will incur gross amounts of electrical bills that would have made more sense just going into the purchase of btc directly.

Your logic makes no fucking sense: he had the money to reimburse the clients MONTHS AND MONTHS AGO, instead waited and didn't even offload all of them.
That is trading, not recuperating. He shouldn't have the fucking option of waiting. It shouldn't be up to them: they're the entity that fucked the money up in the first place. 
So, please explain why he didn't act the moment he could have recuperated anything and instead "chose to wait." And please explain why that's even allowable?
To put it another way, say you made your shitpost the week before he sold any coins. He HAD the fucking coins, he HAD the ability to recuperate everything and WASN'T LIQUIDATING. So where's your argument then? "oh he's just waiting for a better deal?" LOL? That's speculation and trading.

Endless meal is not "whenever your investments go up 10% you get to eat."
also, the math here is fucking idiotic.
say 1 btc = $1000.
$100 is a meal. you buy 1 btc at $1000.
bitcoin goes up to $1100. You "pay in bitcoin and get to eat." 
The price of your meal is 0.09090909 btc not counting transaction fees. But now you are paying short term capital gains tax at cashing out the $100. Lets just ignore that to even attempt to make this scenario work.
So now you have .90909091 btc worth $1100 each.
Here are a few scenarios: 
1. btc drops &gt; $100
2. btc drops &lt; $100
3. btc gains &gt; $100
4. btc gains &lt; $100
You will only ever eat again in one of those 4 options. In the dropping scenarios, not only have you overpaid for your meal but you're now trying to recoup what you cannot.
Sorry, no.

Humm, of course it is. I lived both of those: all of a sudden ACORN and other institutions were saying "ayyy kids, you too can afford a house for like $300 a month! ha ha!" and the surge in new homeowners with "great deal low price" bullshit lead developers to overdevelop. That's the thought process in a nutshell. No different than, say, a really good bitcoin idea being far too early to market and actually causing overvaluation (ha ha pay for your subway sandwich!) 
Exactly same with the web bubble: billions of dollars of VC went into websites that promised to be the future. Which cause a ripple on valuation of websites in general. I did sites back in 2000ish for hundreds of thousands of dollars that you could literally execute in a long weekend for $100 today.
Those businesses that blew all of their cash on developing essentially vaporware they were hoping to be acquired by an entity with more resources defaulted, didn't pay developers and in a few months design, especially front-end web, went from the hottest new career to a luxury for 1%ers that somehow turned a profit on the 5 or 6 platforms that actually profited (out of thousands) could blow their wads on.
I think the outsizing isn't due to liquidity ... rather volatility. If you can move the needle on valuation that much you're just proving that, really, we're dealing with ramp-ups and not any sort of solid valuation. For all anyone knows that entity sold off positions to themselves for a quick dump to break walls. 
Depends on your risk and volatility tolerances... trivial to build a model that would conclude everything above $1k is a bubble. I mean you could also burn grilled cheese on a skillet enough times and see jesus' face
The main problem - and the most valid criticism - of dinosaur man OP is that he does not see the intrinsic value in these things to the point to say it is "not real." Which is the 2nd greatest trick the devil ever pulled: all currency, essentially, is. Which is why his strategy of investing in what "is real" is a false dichotomy to innovation as some sort of speculation of what "could be real."
Anyone who was close to, say, 1980s BBS and modem days saw the internet coming. Any nerd into star trek dreamed for the day of tricorders, and great space coaster with the modular pocket media device.
It isn't merely speculation that predicts future technologies, the speculation is about the nature and placement of it. 
I'd completely respect someone's analysis of what the probable "endgame" to digital currency is, for example, that it just ends up as a B2B backbone to the infrastructure of money with other layers on top of it for the public... but that's putting words in the current power structure's mouths. You're not going to convince Visa and the federal reserve that this is "good" in any way.

Well in theory this works because they are batching transactions and etc, so they can keep the fees near 0 or even absorb them.
So as long as they're actually buying / selling based on your purchases it is not a bucketshop.
Because then they essentially can't "lose" money on a sort of bank run or crash. 
The problems with bucket shops were predicting the antithesis of the investors consistently. Once a bucketshop "loses" they resort to basically stealing to pay out.

For example if you force every transaction point to an integer X,Y coordinate this would appear square and lose the sort of cellular look it has with concentric circles.
Also, what is your rationale behind some transactions having "longer lines" than others. It seems arbitrary.
Every transaction should be represented with identical lengths to each address. It would be interesting to see a representation which ended with all transaction lines being identical, as that would be the most accurate.

How are they wrong? If you buy bitcoin right now you pay no tax on it. Why would you?
Thus "transferring" bitcoin is not a taxable event, so this article (and most of forbes' articles) is clickbait because it is implying that you ARE SUPPOSED TO be paying taxes for "transferring." 
Here's all the article should be:
Title: "How to transfer bitcoin without triggering taxes"

Define "usage?"
Because you'd have to be a retard to convert fiat to bitcoin just to incur extra fees to pay for things you could have paid for in cash.
If you were so interested in supporting bitcoin, you could just buy amounts that you would have lost paying for stuff with bitcoin, and break even.

You clearly have no sense of scale of early holders, it's what is deluding you to think this pissant daytrading between $1k-20k is a "big deal."

You're shitposting up this thread... 


Yes, no architects built the houses, developers plotted out estates, politicians zone + approve for the housing bubble. Nobody put any effort of calculation regarding the web bubble. Fuck outta here.
Speculative bubbles all 100% have "mental effort" put into it. The problem with them, and what makes them speculation, is when the valuation behind it is grossly incorrect based on people thinking "if more people do this, it will increase in value!" That might be true in an extremely long term, but the bubbles are literally the effect of overvaluation in the short term.
Couple that with bitcoins TRUE scarcity (unlike, you know, finding a web developer in 2000 or finding a house in 2004), and you can see the hesitance.
Of course, if you're a long term hodler you don't care. But as we're seeing literally RIGHT NOW, even a small multi-million dollar positioning moves the needle waaaaaaaaaaaay too much to handwave away the obvious bubble we're in.

I'm not sure what you're correlating there: who gives a shit if you sell the miners to other people?
All of the companies you're mentioning that failed had, flat out, bad business models. 
A successful company (government) will be able to maintain a high hashrate even in bear markets and know how to reinvest to turn profits with their profits to allow even more efficient scaling.
Scamming people with your first product to then attempt to use that money to build yourself a new product is just a retarded idea.
And that's not even considering that these "businesses" could have literally just paid cash for bitcoin at massive, massive gains. I mean, they were invested in the space since, you know, they were entering into the mining sector... ugh.
I just think of all of the BFL mining that happened with BFL obviously holding on to a miner and using it to mine at 0 cost and then offloading the units when they were borderline not profitable at those efficiencies... 
as soon as they realized any gains it should have 100% gone into BTC purchasing... instead... staff to make their front companies look "valid"? LOL
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:22:40
because what you have is coin_a, which is subject to a fork at any moment.
coin_a could then become coin_a and coin_b. At some point in time the ledgers are identical.
except now all of those uses for coin_a (buying gift cards, steam, newegg, whatever) are mandated by government to only be allowable via coin_b. Once the gov gives coin_b the thumbs up, hooray, that's where the miners will flood and that's where the support goes if they more-or-less agree with coin_b's policies. Some miners might not like it for political reasons, etc.
So you as an enduser that's "just hodling," great, you have BOTH coin_a and coin_b. Theoretically I have some claim to currency from the last split that I haven't even bothered with. bitcash? whatever...
However, if you were to continue investing in coin_a and say "fuck that" and sell your coin_b for coin_a, that would make you a TRUE holder of a... but are you going to do that?
That's the issue with a fork. Nothing "goes away" it is just political based on what you want to support technology- and policy-wise.

this makes no sense...
bitcoin has INTRINSIC properties. 
so do ideologies.
If your ideology is having a centralized governing ruler with 100% awareness and control over every value holding token the citizenry uses, guess what? it is ideologically opposed to bitcoin's INTRINSIC nature. Your ideology will basically require you to regulate, centralize, oppose, ban, and otherwise control bitcoin via any sort of checkpoint you can require under threat of force: at the transactional stage, at the storage stage, at the implementation stage, whatever.
If your ideology is that no centralizing governing ruler should concern themselves with the regulation (or organization) of ANY value holding token the citizenry uses, guess what? You might fully back bitcoin and use it to shake the stranglehold end-game capitalist entities has over various governance. Thus your ideology would be requiring you to support, instill + otherwise proliferate it's use. You would champion all of the benefits while downplaying the negatives of, say, "you are your own bank!" (gosh, that's scary, who protects me from robbers?) You would then, for example, boycott or resist any force that tries to regulate, centralize, oppose, ban, etc. Maybe you stop using certain banks, stop voting (lol) certain politicians, stop using certain systems...
"Money" is not "just words." Money is the promise of future value of a token. Currency, on the otherhand, is the short term valuation with no promise. Which one does crypto sound like? (uneducated) People on these forums use money and currency interchangably when they are very much not the same thing.
Bitcoin cannot ever become money. They are, again, mutually exclusive based on the definitions of each.
So yeah you can dribble on about how "things are just labels, maaaaaan" or whatever, but labels ought to be derived from a logical assignment of intrinsic and extrinsic properties.

What are you 14 years old? Obviously functioning adults spend money to live, and have things like savings. 
Noone in the USA has savings? LOL in what fucking fantasy realm do you preside? 
The people who don't have savings don't make enough money to have savings. That's the basic logic there. They pay taxes, insurances + have a cost of living that are all increasing more rapidly than the value of their money. Shitheads who want to maintain control and superiority tend to characterize this group as entirely people who "live outside their means" and "are wasteful" which is obviously not the case. College debt, insurance and tax as well as modest cost of living are enough to basically sap anyone from having any savings that are even remotely useful. 1-2 month emergency fund would be a pipe dream, let alone 6mo-1yr. Let alone also having the money to pay for the emergency itself.
The people who do have savings DO make enough money to have savings. They have diversified accounts and holdings. Real estate, property, investments.

To be fair just because it is at $100k, $500k or even $1 million doesn't mean it isn't a "scam."
I mean isn't one of the lessons learned here that a currency is basically always a pyramid scheme? Unless when you invent the currency you dole it out evenly, isn't it immediately lopsided in SOMEone's favor? 
Everyone brained would agree that this is 100% a "if you get in early you reap massive rewards from doing so" situation. 
Just because a pyramid scheme has a really good idea at it's core doesn't mean it is any less of a pyramid scheme. There is simply no other way to issue a currency: do you think that if they waited until 2020 to allow everyone interested to CPU mine or whatever, that people would be excited for it? That all the development and all of the same hype and speculation would happen? Of course not.
You just have to start it, and whoever's in on it early has an obvious advantage.
Pyramid scheme is appropriate, but I don't think it is a "scam" in the slightest. Everything flattens out, valuation wise, at some point where scarcity automatically increases inversely to, presumably, adoption rates. 
It is theoretically possible for the valuation of 1btc to increase to "all the money in the world when all bitcoins are mined / 21,000,000" if bitcoin was to basically replace every store of value.
So right now, you stand to gain a massive multiplier. But someone who "Gets in" the week before that happens will never see bitcoin increase in value at that same multiplier. 
In other words, there are people right now that have seen ~40,000x their investment. At some point in the future someone might be lucky to see 2x their investment.
Even if 100% of the people claiming it was a scam bought in today, they too could see another 40,000x growth. It is still the "early adoption" period.

"miners" isn't a constant. As the valuation of bitcoin increases, more miners enter into the equation to balance things out. Why assume bitcoin valuation goes up 100x without an increase in # of miners?
We still haven't even seen an endgame state where mining is publicly state/gov sponsored. It would be trivial for a government to ensure they are always gaining a % of all bitcoin via mining.
Likewise we haven't seen an "internet of mining things" endgame state where it is trivial for all of your personal devices to be mining while idling. Now imagine that trickle from non-asics from everyone in the world, on top of asic embedded devices, etc. 
Miners seem like this big, spooky entity now but when mining hits general mainstream that will absolutely dwarf the current pools.

Pyramid is not incorrect use of the term at all, and I agree with you that (what you're describing) a Ponzi scheme is incorrect in describing bitcoin, and many people have used it thusly.
Pyramid is a bit unfair, I'll admit, because there is no centralized "tip of the pyramid" but technically the people who started it are that, impossible for them not to be.
But would you agree that you recruit a friend to join bitcoin, and their desire to buy some increases valuation of it? That it is more valuable simply if 1,000,000 all want some of it versus 1,000? Just the nature of it makes it a pyramid scheme -- and I see nothing wrong with that, I still contend that all currency must be one.

Ugh, no.
"Owning bitcoin" has absolutely minimal impact on if it is established as a value exchange.
Does everyone need to own fiat for that "to work" ? Obviously not.
People struggle with understanding the concept of B2B secure transactions between banks or why a transaction takes a long time to be "verified" in their checking account. Does that mean they don't use banks? Or need them? Does that mean they don't need bitcoin?
If anything, struggling to pointlessly go on an adventure will detract people from using it. You're simply encouraging the ponzi outlook, ie, that lady bought in at a relatively high price point and will be considered to be the greater fool until the price increases, at which point she looks "smart" and encourages someone else to be the greater fool at the new pricepoint. Get in before it increases more!
What's out the window is any sort of sane user experience. It isn't pioneering to be a martyr for something that is not matured with the claim that in order for it to mature people need to "be educated" along these lines. 
As soon as markets speculate the valuation, that force will create the infrastructures needed to make exactly what you're doing far, far less painful and, basically, pointless... and turn it into "what people do." The "proof of concept" has been around for 7 years now of how "it could be." With examples and with case studies. 
At that point, people won't give a shit about the underlying technology of bitcoin. Just like they don't know what's going on when they Venmo or Paypal someone. 
These sorts of showcases are really just flaunting that you've made a partial end-run around banks. Unless you mined the coins, you've just given someone else the fiat for your coins at some point. You still entered the system via fiat, and formed your own system. Great!
Next up make a set of videos about how you use barter systems for employment, rent, food and bills. Though I'm not aware of a barter/bitcoin system for paying taxes + utilities. (besides selling more bitcoin to pay those, I guess!)

Segwit2x is not "bitcoin" thus whatever segwit2x is is not a "takeover of bitcoin."
Stop confusing forks and alts with "what bitcoin is."
Also, don't be surprised when the coin that goes "to the moon" is the one that embraces a government takeover because that is the path of least resistance to full adoption.
Similarly don't be surprised when the coin that goes "to the moon" is the one that resists that takeover.
Oh, and don't be surprised when no coin goes to the moon because asswipes keep making forks and the public never bothers.
But please, please don't pretend that bitcoin as it is right now will cease to exist because some other coin comes along. that's just idiotic.
BTW: any coin that is subject to gov takeover is in a jurisdiction that, you know, that government would require ANY spending outlet to have those exact requirements, so who gives a shit if it is at the coin level besides libertarians who bury silver in the backyard and hide fiat in their walls? 
If you think the endgame of bitcoin is that banks go away and people use it as-is, you're delusional. The reality is either the coin itself will be "authorized" or the places where you use it will be. There is no other choice.
Everyone who's ever spent bitcoin at a legit US business is already buying in to this.

Yes - a layer 2 technology could be used on top of bitcoin's 21,000,000 arbitrary limit to form some other entity entirely.
People make a huge assumption that the value of btc themselves are going to be a form of currency and not just value store/exchange for the sake of keeping the network running. It's a bit silly to see so many FOMO shills in here

This rambling stream of consciousness is proof of the sort of lack of insight most people have. Not a knock on you, per se, but holy shit... do you honestly think bitcoin will go to $1?
1/2 of bitcoin was mined before it was even at $50. And most of that 1/2 was sub $10 / $1. The difference is that bitcoin literally got expensive to mine due to the arms race.
Some people mined 50 a day on their CPU in 2010. Then it turned into getting maybe 50 a year if you had insane rigs at your command. 
So, for you to earn 100 bitcoin in 1 year, how much $$$ would you have to invest right now? 
Now, consider that cost. Why would bitcoin be "worth" anything less than that cost?
And so on.

That doesn't offer any equalization or disadvantage to the rich vs. the poor though, so it's moot? ie, you get more of the new currency when you have more of the old currency: the advantage transfers along with the fiat.
I'm talking about going from 0 currency to "now there is currency." There is no way to do it democratically, perpetually. 
Say you invented PlooploopCoins right now and every person in existence is given 100 of them. What do you do with the people born tomorrow? OK, say you issue them to all newborns moving forward.
What do you do when more people die one year than another? Or when one family has more kids and another family can't have any? And so on... there is no fair way to do it to the point that any truly fair system would hinge on not actually having a currency and just itemizing expenditures with some sort of limit.

It's speculating on the valuation of bitcoin. You are saying "this is a good point to buy" and then, later "this is a good point to sell." No idea where you're getting the "can't turn your bitcoin back to fiat" from, obviously you can sell.
In fact, it gets probably a massive % of the douchebags cluttering up this and similar forums with daytrading broz mentalities out of here and over to those traderz forums. Cool!
Robinhood and other apps like this are 100% bucketshops with very subtle tweaks only made possible by ThE iNtErNeT and MoDeRn CoMpUtInG to obscure that, they are still, in fact, bucket shops.
100% guarantee they are hedging and betting against their investors to cover things. 
Robinhood collects interest on the investors' money. They collect the most by, get this, not actually ever buying the stocks.
Then when someone cashes out on their SICK GAINS they just take a small hit from that one investor that is easily covered by the X other investors that lost, while they still gained interest on just having / investing wisely.
To put it one way, they're likely just doing a massssive short on the entire stock market while investing heavily in less risky instruments.
If you gave me $10 to invest in RISKMONSTER,INC and I agree to it, but then invest it in SAFELONGTERM,LLC, and riskmonster drops down to $5 and you weak hand out, yeah, you essentially gave me $10 of a safely growing instrument for $5. Easy decision for me.
But what happens when RISKMONSTER spikes to $50 and you want out? That's where my rules of "how long it takes to withdraw" and the sort come into play. So perhaps I would only risk some % of your initial buy, etc.
They could simply play it safe and make money off of the initial buy in by timing purchases versus the interest they're gaining by holding the cash, as well as those aggregate buys. 
I'd be curious to see how their interface handles the lag... they HAVE to be including a false inflated value some % over to cover the lag, there's no way a cell phone interface would actually trigger an order fast enough for them to obtain the stock AT your order price. If something is shooting upward they'd flat out lose money on every buy.

Wall St. may have the green light for bitcoin
Posted on February 2, 2018	
The technicals on bitcoin appear to be shifting slightly after a brutal January.
“If you see the trend line over the first month, a 40% correction was baked in,” said one hedge fund analyst.
“We’ll need to see if February provides a dead-cat bounce or a floor for the price,” he added.
From my perspective, how do you determine where there is support on bitcoin?
Unlike other securities like stocks and bonds or even artwork, there are very few  natural buyers. With the price volatility there will be little support from Main Street investors.
Early adopters would be foolish to buy more now. It would raise their cost averaging tremendously deeply cutting into profits.
“We saw funds jumping in in December, I would think most shops were shaken out over the last month, which greased the skids on pricing,” a fund of funds trader told me.
So has the $7,700 price hit earlier on Friday given Wall Street a reason to dip their toe back in. That price would represent a 50% retrenchment from December levels where many funds jumped in.
“The Street is probably the only natural buyer at this point. The question is do they still have the ok to jump in from their trading bosses,” the fund trader added.

My question is if it will ever be possible to reduce down to a common 1 and fraction of 100... like 1 dollar, 1 cent. Do all national currencies have that feature?
In America (and anywhere else that has dollars and cents)...
I personally forsee that 0.000001 bitcoin will become 1 bitcoin in the future. (not "bit" that's idiotic to me).
Because then 1 satoshi will become 1 cent, and 1btc will be 1,000,000 bitcoins. Seems the easiest to me. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:12:30
since everyone is hyping the fuck out of this nonsense, here's some REAL info:
1. you can only move BTC out of cash, you cannot move BTC into cash.
2. you can only buy BTC from cash (at a % loss from basically every other exchange).
3. you cannot use the cash debitcard or get a realtime valuation of $$$ to use with the BTC you bought from cash. You'd always have to sell it first to add to your "cash" (at a % loss, again).
4. You must have a debit card to use this app. You could link a bank account, but that's apparently only for withdrawals. You can only "add cash" to it via a linked debit card.
5. So, to recap, you'd have to not only cover the % loss from buying the bitcoin, you'd also have to cover the % loss from selling it back to cash before you can ever "use" it within cash. They clearly have some sort of direct arbitrage where they make money off of every single BTC transaction bought or sold at any pricepoint.
6. In other words, you are not USING the bitcoin, you're just buying from some corporation that hoarded bitcoin at a premium and selling back to them, at again, a premium.
7. The only sane use of this (partially sane, that is) is to buy on cash and move it out to a different wallet. Except why on earth would you ever do that, they have the exact same regulations that other exchanges do, with a bigger fee.
8. They obscure this "fee" by showing you one valuation of BTC derived from some sort of mystery bullshit, but when you purchase you do not receive the amount you bought, you receive it minus this cut. This is borderline misleading as it should be showing you the amount you'd be receiving for what you're paying for BEFORE the transaction occurs.
9. This is essentially a glorified localbitcoins app wank, where the seller is saying they'll buy/sell all bitcoins at X% off of whatever some exchange is offering, oh but you can only sell the bitcoins you bought from the seller back to them. Wow, really? Gosh, thanks!
TLDR: Fuck this dumb shit

there is absolutely nothing "wrong" with centralizing authorities themselves... there is something wrong with how the variety of iterations of them are corrupt or self-serving.
in the libertarian wet dream there still needs to be laws and forces that act for the people in the case of crime, bitcoin is not immune to that.

Nothing you're saying makes sense.
If you have $200 of bitcoin, and a $100 gas bill, you're saying you convert some of the bitcoin to pay the $100 gas bill?
So, first of all, you're paying MORE than $100 (historically a lot more) due to transaction fees / conversion fees.
Secondly, the volatility is insane. All of your earnings you received from it being OVER 10k are now worth 1/2. How does that work for things like paying rent and meeting the necessities if you are using more than 1/2 of your income...
Say you have a $1,000 check and $750 goes to bills with $250 in savings... and then btc drops to $500... Now what?
The answer is: you have bitcoin from when it was &lt; $20k or whatever to foot the bill. Averaging.
That's a shit monetary lifestyle, to be constantly averaging the valuations over a long period of time. Shrug. You can "spend less on bullshit" with fiat, too.
I think it is disingenuous to say you are comfortably + profitably living on bitcoin without the idea that it multiplied 30x in value from a few years ago. Someone buying in today, right now, would have to wait for it to go to $300,000 each for the same luxury you're referring to.

Bitcoin isn't money.
Money is backed by a promise of future value. Bitcoin is not.
Governments will never dictate someone being paid back in bitcoin as a settlement because governments don't BACK it, like they do their fiat, aka, money.
 is a simple explanation, somewhat relevant to this as it specifically talks about Magic the Gathering Online Exchange going out of business:
Once again, the legal position of Bitcoin is very simple.  "Money" is that which has future value.  "Currency" is that which has current value.  Bitcoin is a currency, with no guarantee of future value.










So, fuckin' wingdings who don't know shit about money posting about it here are really crying for regulation if they want such protections. Otherwise, sure, guard your USB stick with a firearm or whatever. But don't pretend it is because "the world" is unregulated... lol that is asinine.

1 bit = 1 microbitcoin. 
Micro- being 1/1,000,000 or 0.000001.
I'd agree that 1 bit is pointless, and it'd make more sense to call a satoshi a bit in that case, but in the context of CS shit, using an already used term is idiotic. 
I think it's perfectly fine to have bitcoin be this "1" unit, and the smallest unit having another proprietary name, like "satoshi."
Otherwise if 1 satoshi = 1 bitcoin, we'd all be talking about mega-bitcoin = 1 and so forth.
I think as people start actually using satoshis more and more we WILL see a renaming of 1 satoshi to 1 bitcoin.
But, I'm totally fine with the slang "satoshi" and bitcoin. 1 dollar is still broken down by "cents." 
1 bitcoin can likewise be broken down by "sats"

bitcoin can never fail. so shitcoiners ride the predictable declines + corrections, which is why they do it.
information about expecting valuations is extremely valuable. Rather than just pushing a fork live and facing direct retaliation, they schedule the fork + cloak nodes as much as possible so that they can have all of their ducks in a row to capitalize on the panic and market swings.
what is the doomsday scenario? how far back do we go in btc's history: asic non-farms? gpu mining? cpu mining? 
One of the interesting market effects is how bitcoin self-corrects itself because any time there's a perceived weakness or downturn that causes far more speculative buy-ups than not.

@_date: 2017-10-27 21:21:56
stating someone is an enemy of bitcoin is implying that you have a definitive definition of what bitcoin "should be."
This is a strawman argument, in essence. You are positing that "bitcoin = XYZ" (without saying it) and something that makes it something other than XYZ is "an enemy."
Unfortunately that includes upgrades and features.
So Bitcoin = XYZ1.
But when it comes time to decide if it is XYZ1a or XYZ1b, which do you pick? You pick one based on your interest. Just like someone else might pick the other based on theirs. 
And the majority interest wins out.
The irony here is that you don't seem to think this system applies to bitcoin, when at any point up to now (especially back when the valuation was lower) these same interests that you're claiming are "trying to control" bitcoin could easily do that by simply **buying all of it.**
Bitcoin's marketcap is 1) tiny and 2) based on this false sense of fluidity. If you delete the assumed dead or long term hodling, the actual amount being traded is miniscule. 
It would be a trivial effort for TPTB to simply mass purchase it with a black budget authorized by one of the (obvious) front government companies. Literally any government in the world has the ability to flat out invent enough money to "get all the bitcoin" in perpetuity, if you follow this paranoid chain of logic.
But that's not the case. And so you simply have iterative concerns. Are you really surprised that people heavily invested in making money will try to control and profit the most from this system? LOL. Yeah, they're not an enemy.

Free markets also involve punishing shitcoiners and their centralizing shill interests. 
bee tee dubs, if coinbase is gov regulated (it is) it has to play by gov rules. So your horseshit westworld fantasy of "anything goes" does not apply.
You should be seeing this as the fall of some entity trying to play both sides of the fence, instead you're spinning yarn about how the gov backed corporate entity should have "pure autonomy." LOL
You have the audacity to blame the community for the shitty actions of one entity. 
Spoiler: nobody has sympathy for a gov friendly entity getting stung by the rules THEY agreed to play along with.
If you buy into the goodness of regulation -- which you MUST in order to tolerate coinbase -- you thus have a problem wih the concept of insider trading happening here.
On the flip, if you don't buy into that, you think "fuck coinbase."
So I fail to see where you think coinbase is this paragon of free market unregulation

What's the entire premise? It's bullshit based on the idea that someone wants the useless fiat (which is what people want out of) and that a market can be so clamped down that you can only black market purchase... but how would you black market sell it then?
if the fiat ever becomes useful again you would have had 20k of fiat and not whatever you sell it for later.
in other words you dont stave off losses by taking 20k fiat -&gt; get bitcoin -&gt; sell for fiat later when the same 20k is now worth less

yes, attack. you just qualified it by saying it needs to be "Attack resistant" and this is an attack.
the difference here, which has been stated repeatedly, is that this attack is a corporate/banker takeover attempt + push to centralization. 
So consider this a test run. Next time they might "win" and pull enough power onto their chain.
So it is our responsibility to say "hey this is a shitball attack in the guise of 'better technology' but really is supported by big banks / credit." See how discourse works? A thing happens and people rephrase it to elucidate the concepts at work.
Otherwise we should, what, just say "hey guys! this is a fork and there are many good things about it, let's see what happens! may the One True Coin come out on top! LOL!"
**This is a centralization attack pushed by corporate interests to explicitly undermine the current community. They've introduced FUD and confusion at an attempt to bolster their validity.**
Obviously bitcoin "needs to handle" competing forks. But there's a difference between me making ShitForkCoin tomorrow, and this months-in-advance fearmongering campaign. 
Bitcoin will ALWAYS exist or "handle forks" ... it just might not be as fungible as it is now, or have ridiculous difficulty for a while as the hashing power drops. 
But you've heard it here first: i'll be the first to fire up my Jalapeno, GPU or even CPU as the sole miner when "bitcoin dies." 
Likewise, I could just be "making shit up" to push support of the coin I prefer. In essence, I am pre-attacking s2x. Cool!

That has nothing to do with the VALUE of bitcoin. How do you know that with the more people using bitcoin the value won't trend towards $1? Perhaps as people are becoming more aware of crypto in general they're not seeing what's so special about bitcoin, especially since it is less accessible? And so on.
The majority of BTC was gained at &lt;$50, if you look at the price valuation when over 50% of the coins were mined.
If you believe in it's long term value, you should not bother about ANY price, because the utility is irrespective of it's "anchor" to fiat.
11/17/2011... ~8 million coins out there out of 17 million ... and the high? $32.
The price will go back up when people find it "hard to get" bitcoin, and they, you know, want it. Right now it's remarkably easy to buy and DHODLDLD bitcoin, which makes you wonder who the fuck is selling it (and why).

On what grounds?
Coinbase isn't *forced* to do shit, that makes no sense. Look at their terms of service. They support BITCOIN. as-is. 


Someone making a fork and saying "it's actually an upgrade" doesn't mean it is official, or more important, or more of anything. Again, I could claim that CosbyCoin is an upgrade to bitcoin and implement my own fucking fork, does that mean Coinbase has to comply with supporting mine as the official "One True Bitcoin" or else get sued by my high power legal team?

more like $0.50.
In 1930 it was $0.26, but there was a huge price leap because demand skyrocketed due to legislation.
So, your inflation correlation is pure bullshit. 
There are more people demanding things, land costs more. Everything costs more as time goes on. This isn't inflation it's also supply and demand.
The price of milk increased far more than the rate of inflation, and dropped lower today than it was a decade ago.
So that's how you imagine milk not costing $500, by using your mind past LOL FIAT IS INFLATION.
There are plenty of things that are cheaper than they were years ago, due to mfg processes and demand.
So to assert that bitcoin MUST increase in value because "look at inflation reasons" is tediously idiotic.

first of all, bitcoin will be EXACTLY AS STRONG as it was the day before the fork as it will be the day after the fork. Nothing changes about bitcoin.
Now there will be a fork, and that fork will coexist alongside bitcoin.
As long as a trivial number of people are willing to mine+node any crypto, it exists. 
I can say that Bitcoin will have that forever. 
I can also confidently say that it is a TRIVIAL task for a pool to invest some % of their power towards any given coin. It is a simple math equation to prove out if that will be immediately valuable over mining the most profitable coin. So please explain why anyone would mine any fork, if that fork is worth less than the same amount of effort going towards mining the most valuable fork. Mining is selfish that way.
The only reason is, get this, due to the knowledge of governmental influence or long-term prospecting that states after the fork 100% of the spending methods that are currently in place will move to this new fork. That's it. You either know that the A. banhammer is coming for specific crypto, or B. that adoption will greatly favor one or the other. There are no other choices.
If you think that A or B will happen because of some nerd pissing match, and not Mastercard sponsored power struggles, then you are fucking naive and you should stop shitposting up threads.
Bitcoin will only be as strong as the mass market allows it to be. As is, sure, it will be there forever. But when it becomes the official coin of neckbeards burying their silver in their back yard and stockbros getting their xanny tabs on the darknet, and b2x is the one that steam + subway accepts... make your own mind up what happens then to valuation.
TLDR: a very large % of "hodlers" would buy in immediately if b2x promised to make them multi billionaires tomorrow via corporate takeover. This feigned "oh garsh that's not what bitcoin is about" would drop so quickly. Realize that the libertarian / anti-centralization outlook is absolutely not the majority opinion.

what if your friend believes that the function of a bank lending money isn't "to people who can't pay it back" but SOMETIMES people can't pay it back, and so bailing out banks when they accrue enough debt via financing people's attempts at profitable business is perfectly valid.
Otherwise, there would be no such thing as loans and 0 people would have mortgages. I'm sure this homeboy has borrowed money from a bank at some point. Does he not have a house?

The murder claims and etc are probably just additional parallel construction fabrications.
It just seems too convenient that the way this would happen would be some sort of internal horrid opsec method of direct contact.
I would assume that 100% of the people in contact with me were agents or harmful. Why would you not? 
It seems like a massive lapse to say "oh, I use 100% trustless systems except I trust someone contacting me on them" to the point that it's obviously bullshit. 
Just like all those "fake IDs" confiscated. Yeah, nobody would do that. But if they want in, they can just invent shit to do it. 
So the real problem is that people don't seem to think that the entire force of the government can snuff your fucking life out if you fuck with it.

You sound pretty confident that it will forever cost less than $10 to transfer any amount of bitcoin in the near short term.
The endgame is obviously that digital currency will eventually be nearly free to transfer. If not bitcoin then something else: a diff crypto, an L2 network.
The ecosystem/network is still forming, but if bitcoin itself relies on the complexity of devices + additional software it is going to shun mainstream adoption and only be absorbed, immediately, by financial institutions. 
So yeah, "fiat really is screwed" is nonsensical since fiat will be absorbed into OfficialGovCoins and OfficialBankCoins.
People will gladly pay more for an easier, less-friction bearing, system. And they've been doing it for decades. It's gonna take a streamlining after some core concepts are worked out for fiat to even see a miniscule dent.
Fiat is only screwed when crypto valuation replaces "how much $ is it worth." ETA on that? Decades from now, if we're lucky.

seriously, if 2x fork "matters" at all (it doesn't to any major player outside of this bitcoin circlejerk) then at worst it proves that bitcoin was a flawed concept in late-stage capitalism.
at best, bitcoin prices drop (more for me) and the people who prefer 2x fuck off to 2x land (while secretly holding bitcoin) or 2x, get this, really is superior and the world benefits from it being the major crypto.
The  thing that annoys me about these forks / alts / whatevers is that if it is a requirement of crypto to maintain a massive portfolio spanning multiple coins, this early on, it will NEVER catch on at the scale that it COULD.
Nobody walks around with 5 different types of currencies in their pocket. The entire point of a fucking centralized banking system in the US was BORN out of the fact that people were issuing their own currencies and exchanges and getting fucked "what do you mean my Old Man Withers General Store Value Note isn't worth anything?!". 
Saying "there is only one crypto = centralization" is 100% horseshit and missing the point, which is that bitcoin cannot "die out" but it can have no useful outlet.
If the newest get rich quick scheme is to overwhelm and slow adoption due to having a new fork every time these fuckin' nerds can't agree on "the best solution" then the whole thing is a wash and nobody in their right mind would support any of it.

The irony of your post is that any response here would require you to "trust" it, so what are you hoping to accomplish?


Yes, without intimate knowledge of the source code and/or compiling it yourself you have to trust that the code isn't broken or malicious.
That trust has been cultivated by the entire network itself on various items relevant to bitcoin, and the resilience of the code has been looked at with a microscope and beaten to death by anyone with that knowledge.
To put it another way, there are multi-billion dollar interests who have given it their approval and they have the resources to audit it themselves. 
Part of the reason that bitcoin has gotten as far as it has IS that resilience and trustlessness.
The bitcoin protocol itself allows anyone to interface with it. You could write a wallet tomorrow that's your own personal wallet and it would work without any outside intervention. 
The equivalent would be being able to write your own website that allows you to send + receive money within a bank, that doesn't require the bank's approval or permission to do so, but the bank will treat any transaction as "permanent and correct." 
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:01:36


You are confusing "using the most popular chain" with "using bitcoin."
The current bitcoin that you are using doesn't "go away" because 2x potentially becomes more popular. So put your dollars where your rhetoric is and stick with the current bitcoin, then. 
Just like 2x or bcash won't go away because it may not be the most popular at any given moment.
My money is on whichever bitpay + other fiat converters go with, such as coinbase, will decide how this plays out. It's that simple. For every libertarian anarcho-neckbeard out there, there are hundreds of people who just want to use whatever they can that, say, steam or newegg will accept.
We can't cry a tear over popularization driving what the, duh, most popular chain is. Especially because MOST people are crypto-illiterate, so MOST people don't care about or understand the nuances of centralization / tech.
The problem is people are more than happy to take a massive valuation hit if it means, you know, they control bitcoin even a tiny bit more. So this fork's priority is that control grab 1st, everything else a distant second.

To say people have wiggle room is an understatement. Never mind your assumptions about who is mining, who the "unknowns" are and which governments/entities would step up to ensure no catastrophe remotely resembling what you're talking about could ever possibly happen.
The naivete of your numbers at least make you sound hopeful that someone will say they're not taking crucial factors into account, which they're not.

pure fantasy. 
1. there is zero reason to sell the equipment. it doesn't happen now. 
2. the large miners have decades of coverage, not 2 years.
3. people were mining thousands of coins monthly. 
4. "guess who has all the money"? We already know a few very big whales who have used their profits to successfully position and prop up hardware AND their own coin, and used both to leverage positions and time windfalls.
5. you're also nowhere near realistic about how mining gets distributed. The price of BTC drops to $1k and people bail lowering the hash rate means if you'd stay at the same rate you'd be making that many more BTC. It would be a windfall for mining, not a "uh oh time to abandon it" moment. 
This only makes sense if there were only massive miners / pools and not people making minor profits/losses/breakevens with smaller rigs.


This is what's wrong. it's not 1/5th of them would continue. it's 100% of them would continue at 1/5th of the power. In fact, it IS more profitable if they don't sell off and just break up their 4/5ths "overkill" by leasing/portioning it off. You build a massive warehouse, you're not going to turn off 80% of the rigs and keep 100% of the rent overhead, and so on.

your tldr sucks but you know that
there is no solution here besides banks fully embracing crypto and people registering addresses with banks/sending crypto through banks
otherwise you can’t prove that you sent the crypto and anyone can claim that they didn’t receive it.
The obnoxious part of this story is why Barclay’s would reverse the transaction when their punishment should be “too bad you shouldn’t have bought crypto.”
Further, they would have contacted you. Reversals don’t just happen without contacting both parties and getting their side.
Imagine any other parcel and rhem just taking someone’s word that they didn’t receive it.

it's not tinfoil hat to state that a government entity will support a technology when they are comfortable that they are controlling it.
the way they will do that is in the portion THEY ALREADY CONTROL: fiat. 
if you want bitcoin to ever be 100% fluid with fiat, it will require this regulation. 
It's more of a myopia that people will somehow thrive with crypto and still freely pay government bills with it, without that gov regulating the crypto.
now go right ahead and play eHacker Matrix l33t games by lying to the government the first time you are on paper with having "some crypto," they audit you or pass law that you must report 100% of the crypto, and ultimately fine or come down hard on you when it turns out you had lots more that you didn't report.
The regulation that makes this contraband is trivial. just look at the executive order effectively banning that Venezuelan crypto in the us. they don't want it to be "free," they want it to be controlled in a way that makes tracking trivial / integrated into other digital cash + centralized.
if anything, the tinfoil hat is being worn by those who think the government is "working hard" to legitimize bitcoin and also not control it. 
nobody at the heel of corporations will pass legislation that risks where they're getting paid from.

yeah because anonymous dark net users are totally reputable sources of "actual feedback" and noone has EVER made fake profiles with fake reviews to position themselves as legitimate to snare others.
BTW the  tactic for infiltrating distributors is positioning yourself as a legit vendor with legit reviews. 99% of those vendors are law enforcement selling to whomever, to then refer to how they're legit when they look to get more product. They do this by contacting other sellers and saying "hey i'm a huge seller here and I need a new connect."

or are you just clinging to the fantasy that if a government decides to buy every bitcoin that's for sale, all the time
/// and are pretending they haven't been through various companies that got miracle funding and legal sway/// 
that it would in fact math itself out to making all of the other BTC that are hoarded forever "more valuable?"
This "barrier to entry" that people are talking about can't get much worse. 
The bottomline is that we're likely a betatest for some bank/government using this system in a B2B, non-public environment which tracks every single transaction without any "evil hackers" being able to manipulate them.
all of the pricing, the manipulation and the thievery was all a test to see how anonymous, how much control even via decentralization, and how robust it would end up.

no. the price IS irrelevant. 
what you said makes no sense. if you lose 80% of the overall hashrate, your gear that would now mine 1btc at $5k would now mine 1btc for $1k.
And if it is so "driven by price" as you assert, everyone would throttle down evenly to match cost of running their rigs with the value of the coin. In other words, nothing changes except the value of bitcoin. 
All pools and miners would just be using 80% less hashrate, but have the same %.

Crypto being deflationary doesn't do that. Yet we have a bunch of chart-tards who are quick to point out all the ways it doesn't function like an inflationary tool while clinging to the one (value = forced increase due to demand) that doesn't matter.

you don't understand the basic crypto ecosystem if you think it is "people" doing this.
The number one provider of coins to "the exchanges" and the "cackling evil THEY" are miners who need to use fiat to keep on mining (likely followed by whatever whales need to refuel the gasoline on their combustion engine powered cocaine wheelbarrow)
Miners that are seeing profit will not stop doing this since it is near zero risk to continue on.
Miners who are not seeing profit are risking future valuation and likely selling some at an opportunity loss to keep the venture going.
But pretending there is any meaningful impact from some noob who got a USB stick with 0.002 btc from their weird uncle for their birthday when all they wanted was a nintendo switch gift card because they put it on coinbase to try and turn it into 0.002001 is laughable.

not the same as




a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.
ie, the whitepaper uses nodes/miners INTERCHANGEABLY. It also uses CPU in terms of "how people mine.
I mean, the bottomline is that the bitcoin core reference client has full node capabilities built in and used to also be a miner. 
**This is because at launch, everyone ran the reference client and everyone was a miner with their CPU and a node.**
His point was that **you only needed to use the full node wallet IF you were mining. Otherwise you could use a "quick wallet" just for transactions**, that didn't need to keep 1TB on a drive and chew up bandwidth 24/7 if you didn't want to reindex/refresh, to confirm transactions. 
Point me to where anything was updated for ASIC mining pool rhetoric, etc.
That's what's the most telling about people referring to old listserv posts, forums, whitepaper. they don't seem to have the context of reality and so people twist the meaning and take it literally when the actual context was pretty straightforward.

pick a basis. it isn't 0 basis, like the chart. I mean, I was referring to specifically "target demo" populations. The people rich enough to afford an automobile took decades to happen. So that's another basis: pokemon go is a FREE product that relies on other products to exist. 0 cost piggybacking on assumed expenses.
Now 4 year olds have a cell phone in their pocket, and a massive number of people on the planet have access to a smartphone. I'd say more than have even full internet access.
Not even in the mid-1990s did every household have a computer. Let alone multiple computers, a computer in their appliances, and a computer in their pocket.
Also, "the internet" was around for much longer than this chart is purporting, so the "start points" are a bit suspicious. 7 years? No.
For example, if you consider "any app" getting 50 million users as the product, that's a lot longer than 19 days. Just like "any/all website(s)."
the chart is mixing:
1. infrastructural users (wider systems) with subsystem users (relies on a prior invention for adoption)
2. physical product users (assembly line, physical products),  and virtual product users (0 distribution needs, infinite cloning/duplication).
Pokemon Go gets 50million users when people have
Electricity &gt; Cell Phone &gt; Internet  and the popularity was boosted by people with Electricity &gt; Television  or  "portable gaming"
Bitcoin's core base isn't a bunch of children being entertained, it's a bunch of neckbeards who hide money in the walls and listen to HAM radio doomsday alerts.

This is not the syntax anyone speaking English as a primary language would use.

In other words, he's the weak hand SELLING his bitcoins to someone else, offering to buy his bitcoins by converting them into FIAT for him.
It's like saying you're an activist but then you pay federal taxes that 100% go against your beliefs. Zzz.

actually, they are NOT breaking the impostor rules in the Twitter EULA:


You'd say "But wait, they are posting as  yet they only post about Bitcoin Cash and use it to openly declare that Bitcoin!=Bitcoin"
So the argument is "bitcoin cash is the true bitcoin." 
You cannot use the argument that bitcoin cash is "derivative" because both bitcoin and bitcoin cash have "changed in nature."
I'm setting my personal opinions aside to make this argument, because it is central to any open-source "forkable" idea.
If you have an idea that states ENTITY=X. 
Then you get a fork where only one tine of the fork changes: so now you have X and X(1). You still would state that ENTITY=X, and it is clear that the name of entity follows the X fork.
But say both tines have substantial changes and are the product of a base disagreement, you don't have X and X(1) you have X(A) and X(B).
The naming convention then falls under whichever tine has the most dev adherence and momentum. Obviously, it would be the devs that stay closest to the original resource pools: entitytalk.org, r/entity, entity.org.
If you then create, after the fact, entity.com, entity.com/forums, r/etit and so on, those are clearly secondary.
It would have been a smarter strategy to distance from the original brand as much as possible and "live on your own strengths." Instead, you have people all up in this shit, trying to poach the userbase, to misdirect, and to essentially ride on the coattails. That strategy is because there is a simple fear that the coin couldn't live on its own if it was branded differently, with it's own unique URL, and etc. People would look at it on the merits of its development and think: FUCK YOU. Or it would just die under the weight of its own irrelevance. People might just see it as a "hey I can increase my holdings by X% if I just get enough momentum to pass this off as real!!!" and there you go. 
 mean, I *guess*? it is a valid strategy to position yourself as "the coin your grandmother buys on accident because they're confused." 
But why would you want to be that? And so again, they assert that it's actually bitcoin that is that coin.
That was my top concern with b'cash as an entity... if it was so superior, it would have absolutely no problem establishing itself as the true "bitcoin path."
This is absolutely nothing new in the open source, github driven market. I've seen this exact thing play out dozens of times on many facets of the same diamond: looney dev goes nuts and gets crowded out of his own project, fork is superior and supplants it with a totally different name... looney dev takes full control, fork cannot keep the spirit up and 1 person solo builds their true vision... fork happens that splits the devs and they end up making 2 shitty products in parallel that both fizzle and everyone wonders what happened to the useful thing... and so on...
but i have NEVER seen someone make a "SimilarWare" that actually means a shit in the long run. They take their short term gainz, use their notoriety until the well runs dry, and then are never heard of again. The only difference here, is the people perpetuating this horseshit are early adopters with relatively infinite resources to delay that "fuck off nobody gives a shit about you" by flat out paying for presence and creating thralls that know for every bit of disinfo they're able to pull off that makes their forkcoin that much more % valuable.  Best case scenario is that the SimilarWare gets bought out by a major player to clean the market up. Adobe acquiring macromedia, etc. Or some shitball startup's natural evolution to be sucked up into the anus of a major market player to repackage the small tool as part of a larger suite (see basically every decent app in existence).
In short, it only works as a short term (b')cash grab to align yourself so closely to a major entity. People would have much more respect for the vaporware project if it even attempted to stand on its own. You'd be a fucking idiot to make a decent software and call it Adobbey Faceswapper. It immediately would earn you distrust / scorn. Yet if you called it whatever the fuck that original faceswapper was, on its own, it gets acquired for $$$$$$$. 
Just the fact that their forum is a trollish misdirect towards the phony "stock letter / abbreviation" BTC (too bad that should be XBT reISO 4217) and not "their own" is only feeding into the narrative that it is the True Vision, but really, start your own fucking coin and rebrand it. 
A successful brand would EASILY be able to assert it is the True Vision without referring to the name.
Many, many, many products crash and burn because they only have name and not spirit/nature of the original product. The b'cashers seem to be fuckin stupid enough to not realize they're doing exactly what they're blaming the buttcoiners of doing...
Instead of going the elitist route with a new name and "everyone smart knows this is the true vision coin" they play this baby crying for mom's tit routine of NO THAT NAME IS MINE. I've never seen anyone, ever, argue this in court (from bands to products, IP or otherwise) not come across as looking like a fucking moron for trying to "keep that brand recognition." It sours the brand, and at best looks like a "I will sour your brand unless you give me what I want." Like those scammers posting fake class action lawsuit announcements until the establishment they're targeting contacts them to settle to make the announcements go away.
That effort could have been spent, you know, establishing the brand. It would be one thing if the b'cashers actually had claim to working on establishing the bitcoin brand... but they flat out did not. if anything, their collective checkered pasts and dubious involvements and dealings (proximity to scams + thefts) established bitcoin brand as "black market money." But yes, yes, that happens when you have massive investments in everything, right? You just are bound to be a part of numerous scams and thefts? LOOOL.

@_date: 2018-04-24 16:31:21


this is false.
Reduce decentralization to a binary regarding 51% attacking: "your nodes" and "not your nodes."


true if you're just considering nodes as some sort of % obviously, but no, practically this is also false.
Count the # of nodes: if there are 2 total, bad actor needs 3 to "win."
if there are 200 total, bad actor needs 201 to win (yes i'm aware it is more, just simplifying). yes, "each node is a smaller % of the node count" but that's meaningless.
If anything, running a node makes it MORE inconvenient and less feasible for an attack. It is easy for 1,000,000 people to run 1 node, it is not as easy for 1 person to run 1,000,000 nodes.
And so:
**Each node added is 1 more node that the "bad actor" needs to over come. There is no diminishing return to that.**


that's because the knowledge of "how much % of the nodes/hashing power you control" = money, and nobody is going to reveal that.
The bottomline there is that nobody who is even remotely close to 51% is going to literally kill bitcoin by being publicly at 51%. As soon as they get there, they'd splinter off % to be unknowable. There literally negative value for revealing that control, and positive value for concealing it. Not a hard decision to make.
So you can never know the value of someone plugging in their USB stick or jalapeno miner... or running a full node.
Running a full node without mining still has verification utility, light wallets don't. 
This is irrespective of "hash power."

"Sorry" (read dozens of times in the comments below) but this reads like the next step to the exit play. You have bitcoins and you need to use them so time to start buttering up the community so you can be a part of it. As Ver has proven, nobody gives a shit about the "taint" of the coins. Congrats.
The extreme shadiness, the leaked transcripts, the hand-washing and "shucks I dunnos" while turning around and claiming all you ever wanted to do was build something good is eye-roll inducing.

# banned credit and debit card ‎customers from buying cryptocurrencies
This is not the fucking same as banning crypto buys, holy shit the fud stinks like shit and is splashing everywhere.
No business in their right mind will accept credit card payments for crypto. If you find one, keep digging until you realize eitheer how shady THEY would have to be, or how far up their ass the relevant government's hand is.
Debit is absolutely no different in this context as it is using those credit card networks for purchasing, and you have identical protections when you claim "give me my money back."
So if you really want to know why this shit is happening, go talk to all the carders / chargeback boiz how it's been going for them so far.
Blaming the banks for something no brained person would ever do (go ahead, use paypal or square and see how that works out for you) is just fucking silly.
And none of them have banned wiring funds, because those don't have the same protections. but "hurr durr banned buys" clickbait title to push some shit blog without qualifying it

Nah - it isn't an invasion of privacy for you to contextualize your "bitcoin dream success story" by giving a region.
I am asserting that what you are claiming you do is 100% impossible to do in any country in the world unless you are breaking laws AND/OR passing the bitcoin buck by selling your bitcoin to some entity who is converting to fiat for you.
And by the way, that's basically idiotic to do and only possible if you are an earlier adopter cashing in on the multiplier. If you do that after buying in at $20,000 that's a lot different than buying in at $20, for example, so it isn't a "general strategy."
For example, even the act of getting "paid in bitcoin" by an employer. They are not paid in bitcoin. They're paid in fiat and are converting to bitcoin to hand over to you. And when they do that, someone else is cashing out of their bitcoin (not hodling). And there are fees associated all along the chain, so you are basically getting paid less than you could be because of those conversion rates. Never mind the inflation of people building in capital gains taxes if applicable. (I get a sense you're in europe, so that's probably not).
Shrug. That's why people are responding to you the way they are: you're speaking as though you're living some sort of universal strategy when in reality you're just passing the fiat buck and either illegally taking advantage of some laws or in a jurisdiction where they don't apply.

but at that point there is 0 difference between bitcoin and your digital transferring of DigiFiat because you've removed the decentralization from the picture.
Will anyone give a rats ass when you can pay with PayPal Credit or Bitcoin when the thing you're giving up is your fiat? It is literally irrelevant to the purchaser and only allows those people funneling bitcoin into their hands to do it more efficiently.
It's a pretty simple issue:
1. People already have bank accounts + use digital fiat
2. Purchasing bitcoin just to hand it over adds extra steps and fees, requires additional knowhow and security... especially come taxtime which is another double digit fee.
3. Most people aren't interested in overthrowing the capitalist regime, many people don't even see how legitimizing crypto via KYC/AML regulation even matters or what that accomplishes.
So if you can convince someone that Square "knowing who you are and taking your bitcoin" is actually good for anything but the lambo bois getting valuation, I'd love to see that argument. Never mind the whole problem with hodlers paying out the ass on taxes for actually using bitcoins...

everyone can't pathologically hodl though, since you OBTAINED IT from someone.
The false dichotomy here is "hodl vs. spedn"... do you consider selling btc to someone spending it?
Miners spend REAL MONEY to mine, they need to recoup. They sell. It's that simple. And that and future speculation is what drives the price, buoyed by hypothetical maximum values. If you believe that bitcoin will become the one world currency, it's grossly undervalued, for example.
Besides, 99% of the "spending" of bitcoin goes into a payment processors' wallet. They're basically just buying bitcoin from you with a promise to transfer the fiat to someone else. 
They then have positions and sell off as needed + profitable. 
All those RedditGold and Steam games bought for tens of thousands of dollars of current btc valuation didn't go into reddit/steam's pockets. it went into bitpay or wherevers, who marked the positions and sold at healthy profit.

When I part with my money I don't pay short-term/long-term capital gains tax on it. I don't pay a "convenience fee" for the intermediary, double dipping if I had to pay that same fee to purchase. I don't hand over KYC/AML information to some rando internet hero. I don't risk my holdings to non federal government regulated/insured entities.
It's all well and good if you're shunning both the protections and the restrictions of the Evil Capitalist Overlords... but don't pretend that everyone wants to bother doing that.
The problem with ubiquity regarding cryptocurrency is that you have 0 to lose if you enter into it later. Eventually if everything is crypto all you're losing out from is that mythical "huge multiplier" that fewer and fewer people benefit from as the valuation erodes. If in X years all your fiat turns into GovCoin there's no penalty for not involving yourself with crypto beforehand. 
Especially if, in that endgame, the existence of GovCoin and other major outlet coins AmazonCoin, FacebookCoin, AppleCoin, GoogleCoin (nevermind ChaseCoin, CapitalCoin, HSBCCoin) conspire to basically make all other coins flat out illegal to deal with, closing down all "legit" exchanges.
The best case scenario is what, exactly? That those exchanges are taken over by these new powerhouse legit exchanges and obsoleted? Or that the gov declares "ok they're all interchangeable without these cap gains taxes, hooray!" 
In some's mindset the best case scenario is centralized government fiat is reduced to rubble by crypto... which, i mean, that'd mean the gov itself is reduced to rubble... which... uh... you wouldn't really have to worry about "legislation" at that point, because we'd have bigger infrastructural problems if that occurred.

This is bad logic.
If you didn't spend crypto, and instead spent fiat in the first place, you'd have more fiat and would end up with more crypto.
say something costs $100.
you buy crypto, which has fees.
you use the crypto, more fees.
you might pay taxes on whatever gains happened in that time.
You pay &gt; $100 to spend $100, then buy more bitcoin (more fees).
Versus: you use that $200 to just buy bitcoin in the first place (less fee triggering).
People are deluded if they think that bitcoin "inherits their store of value from their medium of exchange property."

Nobody in the world is going to jump through the hoops to obtain bitcoin to then pay via square when they could just press one button to use the exact same fiat with less fees and hassle and pay via square.
choose one:
(A) bank -&gt; square payment 
(B) bank -&gt; bitcoin exchange (fee) -&gt; wallet -&gt; square (fee) -&gt; square payment
Accepting bitcoin means literally dick except for the lambo bois getting outs on their pseudo"hodlings."
Now, getting banks + payment processors to seamlessly exchange? That'd be massive. Getting decentralized exchanges? Massive. Getting FedGov exchanges? Maasssssive. Getting major retailers to accept or create their own coin trading freely with other coin? Unbelievably massive.
But some clowny processor enabling one way spending? **FART SOUND** All those have EVER been is some Big Biz capitalists using venture cap to just flat out buy bitcoin. BitPay got 100% of the bitcoin and sold it at a profit, or held it. Steam, Newegg, Overstock? They don't have "crypto holdings." So who gives a fuck.

No, that's not what it shows, if you actually bothered getting off your neckbeard soapbox and looking at their patents they were all rejected because they literally were ranging from "uhhh patent for a way to do money digitally from one computer to another" to "ok, ok, uhhh patent for a way that lots of computers can do money digitally."
IE, they were all vague and nondescript: shooting shotgun into the ocean in hopes they "secure" some prime fish.

getting my lard ass to pedal a bike is vastly less efficient use of my energy than riding a motorcycle.
if that's your argument then walking is even more efficient, as it doesn't take time into consideration.
I'd say the raw energy transfer system used in electronics and fuel products is vastly more efficient than bicycles which just cause traffic problems in many major cities due to their poor integration with cars. In cities where that's streamlined, it's better, but again: define efficiency.

"free pass?" This is such an idiotic argument and it is always trotted out like the best-in-show pony... YOU CAN'T STOP CRIME SUBSTANTIALLY BY REGULATING MONEY.
You realize that the criminals have the means to obscure and, get this, do crime? In fact, you could say that it is a requirement of any illegal enterprise to obscure it with legal-seeming things (like passing AML/KYC checks).
Do a google search for HSBC and sinaloa... and see how much the "regulations" impacted them.
So no, I'm not buying this horseshit that your privacy is some sort of fluid concept that can be diminished "if needed" to stop crime. LOL.
If anything, shit like surveillance is meant to keep THE CITIZENRY suppressed and things like cartels, pedos and terrorists in business.
Think of all of the integrations that are happening. Do you honestly think that regulating decentralizing money is going to "end crime?"
Here's an idea, allow cryptocurrency to flourish and actually use all of these high-tech resources to clamp down on the exchanges and gathering places. 
If you suppress something like localbitcoin then you lose surveillance, and you STILL have to monitor it because of how trivial it is for criminals to bypass kyc/aml 
The flipside is that this shitty practice is some sort of impenetrable force? lol ok

But don't veer it into "the original sales points" territory, because you're not going to convince anyone that roger fucking ver is the vanguard of purity.

yes, and i made a fork too. Any time someone transacts on it they are basically signing a contract to come over to my house and blow me. Just once, for lifetime access. You might say our greatest innovation is that it is the most thorough... or at least most intimate... "Know Your Customer" verification in existence. We're talking biblical adherence, here.
Don't worry, I am protected because I have a cabal of mischievous fanbois who can see no wrong as they reap the free money from forking their coins. Besides, they already blew me (from way back before I even invented bitcoin!) so it couldn't be that bad. How dare you question their integrity.
One day I decided that my interpretation of a vaguely written document almost a decade ago could be translated into everyone sucking my cock, and I found the "most reputable" Chinese mining cabal and ostracized / outcast devs I know to make my own fork.
And I won't be bothered to come up with a reference client, keeping the actual machinations themselves able to be changed whenever the fuck I want as the dev pool that supports it is tiny and so on a small leash that I can maintain via dangling my blow'cash in front of.
Oh, and did I mention mine is the true bitcoin? Every other fork is more centralized or shill developed, infested with feds and corporates. Oh, and don't worry about the valuation, I am an early whale and the mining cabal has profited greatly from exploiting ASIC, so we can literally burn that % advantage on PR/Marketing and pumping, since, hey, it's just a fork and we also have all those other imposter fork coins, you know, to sell off and cause well timed price changes we can profit on either side of!

the entire point of this is to collate bitcoin addresses. if you use bitcoin to buy something and get a shipping address. amazon would store that in a database (no shit) and share that with all of their vendors (also no shit). If you opt in to being identifiable, you will be identified. Amazon is proposing a way to store that.
I mean, blockchain has certain addresses labelled already.
This implies that amazon would be directly taking bitcoin payments, because if they were using a payment processor the coin would not be coming from "your" wallet.

then i switched to a GPU to maintain that.
when my graphics card crapped out, i thought "screw bitcoin it isn't worth getting another graphics card for hundreds of dollars just to GPU mine, what a waste."
never mind how shady "purchasing" bitcoin was. Look at the oldest exchanges... look how many scams and fails happened back then.
we all knew the theoretical "what if all currency in the world was replaced with bitcoin" what 1 bitcoin would eventually be worth. I mean, 21 is 1/1,000,000 of all the money if bitcoin is the only thing left.
governments and current money power holders are still doing all the things we thought they would do to stall legitimizing bitcoin. not all, but many. And it doesn't really matter unless you plan on moving to a place where it is legitimized, if it isn't where you're at.

It doesn't lose censorship resistance because in order to exchange cash for bitcoin you need to follow the governmental issuer of that cash's laws...
Privacy was never a part of the "value prop."
There are plenty of regulations that work. Centralized banking works. I know, you want to put on your cowboy hat and go back to the time when every general store issued their own money and "too bad" when they disappeared in the night.
To put it another way, there are plenty of people (but less and less every day) who are interested in bitcoin as decentralized, iterative banking. I want to be ensured that my MONEY (not my currency) is untouchable. A bank won't collapse, some shitty actors making bad decisions impact my piece, and so on.
That's it. Not "lol gainz" or even the valuation of it. Don't care much.
It is also quite trivial to convert fiat into bitcoin, but the catch is "they want to know who's got it and who's selling it."

@_date: 2017-07-26 16:14:39
Think of it this way: do you see room for innovation that Bitcoin (which will always be the most mature cryptocurrency at this scale, at this point) will not be able to absorb appropriately?
When you see new crypto, are you informed enough to understand the functional differences and how markets might move due to them?
The problem is, you're asking "what are better cryptos" and I can tell you PenisCoin and how would you know if it is better or not? 
The problem we've come up with is we had people seen as major forces in the community state that "XYZ is better" when they had very specific reasons NOT RELATED TO THE ACTUAL FUNCTIONALITY OR UTILITY to state it. 
It's like asking warren buffett what the best flavor of salad dressing is, and the one he tells you is the major product of Geico Insurance.
Looking at bitcoin as "possibly crashing" is completely irrelevant to many people's interests. The only people who'd give you advice along those lines likely invested at some other pricepoint, want cheaper coins to buy, etc. The people who bought at 0.10$ a coin or had so many they've been selling at every price point for thousands of dollars to live off of, or just holding until they get old enough to not care... they'll laugh at the idea of it crashing.
It literally cannot crash low enough for people to "lose." And if it did, it is just setting back the clock on it a few years (which is still a major multiple of many people's initial investments) ... if it dropped to $10 each overnight, I'd even wager that would cause many, many, many more people to buy any coin they could. 
I know far more people who would never sell their holdings at $10 or even $100 than would get rid of them because they think they're worth less than that. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:03:15
wrong. holy shit if you had any volume in the US you'd be vanned and thrown in debtor's prison, just look up the facts.
when you crypto to crypto trade you are establishing basis. 
put it another way, say you got in on 100 Crypto_A at $0.
Then you trade that 100 Crypto_A for 100 Crypto_B which is worth $150.
Congratulations, you have realized a gain of $150.
If you don't believe this, look at all of the "holy shit I am fucked" posts in various subreddits where people traded crypto to crypto and "broke even" on the trades, but were realizing gains / establishing basis with trades.
If you understand texas holdem poker in a casino, taxes in crypto is similar to rake. you can "break even" by winning the same bet 10 times and lose 10 times, but every time you "won" you lost whatever the casino's rake % is
that's the main problem with daytrading atomic swaps, you're not triggering long term gains, so you have to factor in anywhere from 30-40%  taxation any time your trade happened.
eg: crypto_a 100 at $0.... traded for crypto_b 100 worth $100... taxable event, $30 tax owed.
100 crypto_b goes up to $110, traded for $110 worth of crypto_a... taxable event, $3 tax owed.
it's WORSE for crypto to crypto trades because the gov wants $$$ that you don't have, unlike if you were selling it. And then selling your crypto has fees unless you're doing to peer to peer.
i dunno, people seem dismayed by it but it's no different than ANY OTHER capital gain. Did your "holdings" get established by some basis? then you're taxed. 
If you mine crypto you're expected to report the basis. You don't just "get free money" from mining until you "sell/use it." they want the basis established so that the diff between short/long term gains can be determined. unfortunately this is an archaic system because the implication and where that was derived from came from the idea that you were "leaving your money in the system to be used by whatever institution." with crypto it is the opposite

LN is a layer2, and nothing to do with bitcoin if you don't want to use it.
So the main difference is segwit, and that is countered by blocksize increase. Yet BCH has EDA.
My favorite is that bch has no 'reference implementation' (because they couldn't make one if they wanted to) and is instead is used by other clients that choose to support it, some of which simply take bitcoin core and change the block increase while stripping other features. Weird.

That is why BCC is "bashed." It is like we pulled up our pants after struggling to shit and then realize we still have more shit to deal with. They need to fuck off and do something productive rather than compound scam  with 100 more scams because sensitive apologists like you come across as will always try to rationalize things out (without all of the information.)
We would never even know about these tools if their scam hardware wasn't revealed. Imagine if those revelations came out BEFORE everyone was even-headedly debating the pros and cons of the BIPs? Yeah, convenient that you're leaving that part out.
This isn't about the ability to fork: you're making it that. This is about when people use the ability to fork to cause market shifts that are advantageous to basically only them. 
Never mind what it does for adoption in the short term, the long term you will see bitcoin shake out and look better for it. 
We're so far past the idea of "forks preserve democracy" with this it's silly to even mention it. OBVIOUSLY this "tests the flexibility and durability" of bitcoin. But if you don't see how this is an utter waste of effort and time, both of which could be going to making ACTUAL improvements and testing implementations, I have no idea how to communicate with you.
And no, just because it isn't 50/50 is exactly why it's not a fork. Someone peeing a puddle next to a river isn't a fork in the river.

current solutions inflate costs due to processing fees.
current solutions require additional hardware/software: not every POS has an internet connected computer, and it isn't exactly trivial to install, setup and use.
Accounting/fraud/returns? Wha? Crypto's strength is in the accounting. You can see every single address that received every single transaction.
Fraud? What's the fraud? I pay you in crypto, you see that you're paid, and you give me the product. There is no bouncing a check or stealing a credit card.
Returns? Nope. 100% of "returns" are not done via crypto with these third party solutions. They're done with an added bank account or credit card, where the refund comes in FIAT. So much for the "anonymity" of crypto, eh?
The cleanest solution is to accept crypto directly. The problem with that is the person purchasing needs to convert fiat to GET crypto, and the vendor needs to convert crypto to GET fiat. Until, you know, mass adoption happens and there is more of a use case for it in terms of a network.
The minute a vendor can use crypto income to purchase a regular utility, the minute it is useful. 'til then, it's just more work and more expensive due to 3rd party.

Spotted: this is bullshit.
The log viewer shows "Balance 15 $"
This would mean that the hacker has gotten access to the account via API key info already, because, you know, every user turns that shit on for sure!
And even then, when the person clicks through the demo, the balance is actually in bitcoin, not in $. 
So that would mean they'd have to hit the API for "type, currency, balance" as coinbase's API doesn't have a single "balance" return, it has multiple types of accounts: wallet, fiat, vault. and then within that type it has a currency used... why wouldn't l33t h4ck3rz have every column out of the API to see exactly what an account held, if that was the case? 
and to get it to 15 instead of 15.54 ...that also means pulling the exchange rate, and figure all that out, just to then truncate, integer or floor the result? Why would you use coinbase's exchange rate to see balance when you would likely not "sell at coinbase price?" why would you use the bitcoin rounding value instead of full string like shown at end?

This is a rather drastic 180 from the days when anyone discovered to be buying/selling crypto via PayPal had their funds held indefinitely, transactions reversed (with the crypto lost), and scams-a-plenty.
The rate at which coinbase suddenly had MSB approval when nobody else could do it, and now this, screams of centralization or behind the curtains actors, while other entities doing things as legitly as the vague laws allowed were shooed off.

No, wrong.
"THE" blockchain was not invented in 1991. I'd even say that "A" blockchain wasn't invented then. The IDEA of a blockchain clearly was.
Just like some patent writing a potential invention down  down isn't the invention itself.
Your phrasing is very irritating. It's like saying Archytas of Tarentum invented airplanes in 405 BC or Da Vinci in 1485 AD but it wasn't until the Wrights that someone found that KILLER APP to actually make it happen usefully...
...never mind the proliferation of the internet and accessibility. Even if the software was available in '91 it would be years of pre-mining if released as production.
Perhaps, you know, it was. And the "hey lets version this" that happened via bitcoin was really a ~20 year version. Unlikely, as there were a handful of other solutions.
So no, 17 years? There were others before bitcoin that served the same purpose but had their own problems. Would those others have ended up more like bitcoin did? perhaps...

From elsewhere in the thread:


This seems laughably implausible in basically every way.
Can you point us to links of any other previous public notice of this since feb of 2015? 
Point by point:


How do you know if there are no logs?


Seems absurdly "lucky." Nobody would brute force a VNC just hoping there's a session with a wallet open. They'd do it to drop a payload to secure credentials later. Again your scenario seems way too specific while not being "the way it is done," yet you claim to have no logs. Again, how do you know this is what happened? Out of all of the ways to get into someone's blockchain wallet, VNCing in and them literally being logged in is so astronomically unlikely that I doubt it happened that way. I mean, if they VNCed in, why wouldn't you just assume they captured all of your info.


Now you're asserting that not only the other insecure practices occurred, you had a pointless firewall that simply accepted ANY connections from ANYwhere. I mean, you practically have to go out of your way to configure the firewall that way...


Irrelevant detail. If they already got through the firewall to get to the keychain they obviously don't need the fucking firewall password.
Sorry but this sounds like "we stole the bitcoins internally and are making a public case that we know is impossible to solve." 
I'd like to know who's coins they were. This 100% sounds like someone made up some bullshit about a firewall/vnc/blockchain comedy of errors to take a fuckton of bitcoins for themselves. Moroccanhackers? Lol, OK. Even at 2 years ago's valuation, that's an amount of money that even if I gave you the street address the hackers stole the unsecured wifi from when doing this, i'm gonna go with "they're not there anymore."
Even if they were still sitting there hacking the planet with balaclavas on, I'd love to know someone sophisticated enough to penetrate your system but not so sophisticated that they leave proof of their control of specifically those coins open?

Are you one of those people who think that when someone asks an obviously leading question they're "safe" because they can say "it was just a question" when the entire purpose of the question was to make a statement?
It's why in courtrooms there's an objection called "leading the witness." Good thing this isn't a courtroom, it's an internet forum where people can draw conclusions based on actions and state them.

Unsure how to be more clear. You're aware that Paypal was historically anti-crypto, to the point that anyone caught using Paypal to try and sell/buy crypto would have their funds seized and some people still have no recourse to get them back, with many scams and chargebacks, etc ending up with lost funds on one end and frozen accounts on both ends, with someone making off with the irreversible crypto.
Then late 2015 their tune changed. 
You mention "persistence and hard work," what did that entail? 
Because the dozens, if not hundreds, of vendors that were shut down and barred from using Paypal for crypto transactions were stonewalled and I'd love to know how the major players' persistence and hard work differs from people who simply wanted to use this service 6+ years ago but were disallowed.
I'm not really interested in what changed their mind, because that's obvious, but WHO changed it and HOW is the question.

no it hasn't. when you refer to the USD's value you are referring to it relative to the value of all currency, not "what 1 dollar buys."
Further, the shitpost stat you're looking for is 80% since 1970 and 94% in 76 years.
Swiss Franc is the best performing fiat, losing 80%.
But if you take the relative buying power of all currency, inflation, etc. the number is bullshit since it's not considering how many of those $1 you get per hour of work, and the nature of work and markets changing.
So sure, I guess a 12 year old thinks that's super deep if they aren't also told that while $1 bought a lot more 100 years ago, you'd get far fewer $1 each year.

It is literally stepping away from adoption. It is piggybacking onto existing networks and is thus "more convenient" and so forcing crypto to displace an entire credit system before it is considered "equally convenient." IE, it's placing a hurdle with a bullshitty use case.
The reality is, a shop can take bitcoin directly and you can pay with bitcoin directly. 
The question is how the bitcoin gets to the enduser in the first place. Right now the extra step of "converting your fiat to crypto" is what makes crypto inconvenient.
If you were only paid in crypto and only gave crypto to vendors, it would be just as easy as whatever you currently do.
The powers that be don't want to lose their "transaction fees" stranglehold on chipping away at your money by forcing themselves into the middle.
Any shop with an internet connection can take crypto and get 100% of their profit and not pay some out to a credit card company.

Why would you get a refund, it amounts to the same thing. I'd assume you'd just have whatever basis you used when you filed the like-kind exchange. 
Whatever basis you paid taxes on is your "checkpoint."
You bought at 100, it went up to 1000 and you traded for fartcoin. Your taxed basis 1000 at a gain of 900.
So the next time you trade any coin you have for FIAT, fartcoin-&gt;cosbycoin-&gt;buttcoin-&gt;fiat you just use that last basis of 1000 to determine gains/losses, you don't realize another tax event until then.
You still have to personally keep track of your various basis points. If you sell 100% of your fartcoin it might be at 1001 for a capital gain but the equivalent amount of cosbycoin would be 800 for a capital loss.

This doesn't make sense. Is Coinbase going to close their own account when someone buys bitcoin from them and uses it for "something illicit."
What if you used a casino as a form of a tumbler and didn't actually gamble, making sure you lost money (essentially paying a fee for tumbling?) Who cares if it was called "online casino," all you were actually doing was sending btc to an address and getting different BTC returned at a randomized rate.
What if you mined all your bitcoin but then traded to an exchange and then withdrew from the exchange? You now have 100% different bitcoin than what you mined. 
How the fuck do you know how clean your BTC are if you buy some, or, more accurately, trade fiat for it?
And so on...

yawn, you sound like BTC-yoda. "i lived for years without any money" yet you had to use money to get your BTC, and most outlets you used your BTC was just bitpay buying your BTC and handing vendors fiat.
Again, not everyone lives in an abandoned missile silo feeding themselves on dumpster water and vertical farms made out of hamster tubes.
The irony is 99.999999% of people using bitcoin "as money" is just actually centralizing holdings and power: you're selling your BTC to people happy to buy it. They are long-term holders so they have not needed to "flip" the BTC immediately to pay bills in fiat, they're just acquiring bitcoin.

They have something nobody else has: aggregate information fully under their control. They could completely profit off of interloping with order surges...

No they shouldn't be. It is against the entire purpose of bitcoin. Literally opposed diametrically to what bitcoin is.
Introducing trust into a trustless system is never, ever going to end in a net positive. With that trust comes centralized authority, with that authority comes power + ultimately corruption. There are a lot of eMoney cowboys who don't mind this whole thing going into the shitter as they are the ones who will gain the power. 
Think of it in reverse. Should an exchange trust a user "is good for" the currency? Feel free to start that one up and tell me how it works out, where I can put a sell order out there today with markers that are not actually coins moved to someone else's wallet, because trust me!

same with banks. have banks that run off of any blockchain for provable non-fractional reserve, and allow fluidity between fiat deposits and debit transactions of crypto. the membership fee for this setup is the (cost to run it/number of users). this incentivizes adoption as the more people join the cheaper cost per person to maintain

The problem and why I at least respect the vigor and emotional enthusiasm that anti-Coinbase detractors have is that they are clearly centralizing power and using the power to influence laws.
Those laws will dictate who accepts what money, when.
Nevermind that it goes beyond coinbase and ANY "we take your bitcoin and pay the vendor in fiat" company is accumulating the same power. 
What options does that leave besides people with shitty ass business models who can take on the risk of bitcoin directly?
I tried opening up a few clients' non-profits to accept bitcoin as gifts and they all rejected it because they didn't want someone's gift to potentially be diminished in value.
You "can" use bitcoin, but nobody's saying why you should bother past some sort of V for Vendetta high-school rebellion.

Re: social cooling specifically... Think of it from the other side of things.
As an investor or an employer, do you want the right to know who you're paying money to and investing in? Of course you do.
As far as crimes go, I know we all think we're in an edgy new world order scenario, but this has been going on as long as there have been rulers and peasants. Data collection just makes it more efficient. 
Been proven to be a "threat to the system." Well I should have a right to know who I'm invested in, and who I want to align my company with. If you're a threat to the system, and by hiring you that makes me a threat to the system (that I obviously don't mind because I'm a capitalist) then obviously I want to know so I can not hire you.
**And your logic fails, anyway, edgelord...**
Exacly what "good job" would not get more information about your political / technicalities or stories? If you're punished for something and a company's policy is to never accept you, that's not a "good job" that's feeding the system that you were "protesting." IE, you were protesting the status quo but then you feel entitled to a job that seeks to preserve the status quo? Fuck outta here with that bullshit.

No they didn’t. Instagram stories had 100 million in 2 months of pre-existing instagram users, that was the biggest IG spike.
Instagram daily usage has been a slow boil with spikes based on the ecosystem, and the stats are a bit bullshitty because multiple accounts, industry/entity accounts exist
Simultaneous users != daily users
Sites and apps can rely on caching. Transactions either happen or don’t. 
So define what “onboarding to LN/btc” actually is.
With IG they can use traffic analysis to determine unique visits, they can use account logins, etc.
Is it “has ever used btc/ln?” I’ve been in the space since 2009 and I’m still not onboard LN, and I’d barely qualify as onboard btc at this point.
Don’t forget that it is vapid marketingspeak too, because to be fiddling with BTC in 2011 was not even remotely the same as it is today, So do you count all those who opted out? Or who’s entire BTC experience is to watch it halve in value?
@_date: 2018-12-12 04:08:13
yeah lets stretch the graph so that 99% of the y axis is &lt;1% of the value and not mention how much more risk that narrow band at the peak represents.
You can show the logarithmic growth without stretching the Y axis and shrinking or compressing the X axis like this chart does.
People spouting off that this is inaccurate or misrepresentative are still dopes but you could easily rescale this chart to exaggerate it less.
It simply shows a growth pattern that doesn’t emphasize the risk difference, when sub 3k is so much of the chart and 3k to 20k is so tiny. 
Nice thing to remind people that 1/2 of all bitcoin was mined under $50, and how people have seen millions of % gains since the beginning.
Each one of those drops are ~80% of its value, and those gains are multiple 1000%. It just stings more when 80% is 20k to 3k and not $20 to 3, though in both cases the loss % is the same

Yes, but the point is that if bitfinex's databases of user holdings is 100 btc but they only have 1, they have to buy 99 from somewhere to hand it over. The irony to this is that it implies they had the funds to cover the 100, and could have just "bought" whatever they used the money on in the first place. It's simply less risk for them to buy their dev or ads with YOUR funds instead of theirs, since they already established the IOU.
The entire point of fractional reserve is the idea that since it must inflate over time, it is "safe" to take the 100 that people are owed, figure out the typical daily withdrawal rate (say 10 with extreme spikes of 50) and then loan out or use the other 50 to profit.
People want banks to be zero sum, but banks have to do things like pay real estate, employees, tech maintenance. They do this via fees + using the money.
So, I don't really get the point. As soon as you put your coins on coinbase they give you an IOU. Where does it say what their obligations are regarding you withdrawing?
But I'm all ears regarding what bank can exist that offers centralized security or insurance with zero fees. If coinbase is hacked (equivalent to a bank robbery). The only thing I can think of is a bank that runs off of a subscription fee to cover costs with zero fractional reserve in place.

The previous comment SHOULD be downvoted because you are completely wrong regarding what a "bank run" is and how it is relevant to this case. Bank runs occur when it is clearly obvious that the bank is going to give an IOU to the IOU and not have your funds available, so people cascade in to pull money out ASAP. 
If there is a declaration that a custodian is NOT a fractional reserve and using holdings to try and gamble/profit, then there could be no bank run.
Also, it's ironic that you're referring to coinbase as a bank... the only way they're similar to a bank is that they have control over what you can do with your promised funds when you attempt to engage them. 
Coinbase makes an upfront profit from transactions. 100% of their database of user holdings should be available at all times for users to take back. They shouldn't have to spree purchase to cover. It should be a trivial "ok, pulling coins out of cold storage" if 1 person does it or 100,000,000 people do it.
It should be trivial, and the fact that you're characterizing it as "an attempt to bankrupt exchanges" shows that you don't understand the entire purpose of cryptocurrency.


As a demonstration that they don't have the coins that they are promising to have OR that you don't even have access to. I would assert that those exchanges do not need to exist, besides, what are they doing with the funds anyway besides chasing the dragon of trying to grow the exchange so that they profit more via developing profitable features, advertising, whatever? That should all be covered via a percentage of their cut on transactions. Not WITH the transaction funds.


That's completely false. Institutional budgets are required by law in the US to be balanced. You can't claim that "well it's because you audited us when we were still waiting for all of our prostitutes to return with our money is why it failed" or "I was gonna put it back later" or whatever. And the equivalent of this in a non-profit sector, for example, is the yearly audit. 
This is all the more important because there's frankly no reason EXCEPT for Coinbase's profitability and US-based "know your customer" laws to run an exchange the way it is being run due to the linking to fiat.
Exchanges could be trustless and require no identification quite trivially, with everyone in control of their own keys. But then you could only exchange "fiat tokens" and would be breaking any number of laws in the process.
TLDR: yearly audits aren't "attempts to bankrupt," they're confirmations. If you think this poses any risk to bankrupting an entity by pulling out the funds on one day, you're trusting the entity the other 364 days which is a huge flaw.

They don't have to run for jesus, they could run for the free money they get by taking a cut out of every transaction. 
Think of something like a vendor using something like Bitpay to process payments. A service like that could easily run off of the profits it gets for the fees accrued from using it, both from the person purchasing and perhaps a membership/API usage fee that the vendor pays. 
The equivalent here is if a service like that decides, "you know what, we don't actually have to pay out the vendor until the 1st of every month. So between the 2nd and the 15th we will leverage the fiat we owe them on a bet on the future valuation of the crypto."
More greed from the payment "processor," more chance that they lose money on that bet and have to further leverage to cover.


The only assumption here is YOU assuming what's being  assumed.
If they're leveraged to the fucking hilt, it comes out in the wash. If someone who cares enough to pay attention to those things points out some sort of violation of a law or whatever, maybe something besides a huge confidence hit will happen to those entities. Or, maybe it won't matter.
All that will do is prove, in the long run, the resilience of the underlying technology and how any attempt to act as a 3rd party is not to be trusted / not needed.... until your 3rd party is whatever government's fiat.
I remember when btce, mtgox and localbitcoins were the dominant forces, and the same exact shit about how "crucial" they are was spouted back then.
That's since transformed to "well where would the valuation be without them?" And the response to that is "who gives a fuck?"
The pain in the nuts about this, is if they were forthright about it and offered a piece of the gamble to the coinholders people would sign up. Not as many, but it'd be an option.
They could easily say "hey, we'll add X% (with X very possibly going negative) to your account if you let us gamble with it. People would definitely use it as a form of riskier investment. And something tells me they're not going to fight that fight of directly offering an instrument of that nature as it goes against The Agreement or The Plan.
Just a hunch, but I would not be shocked if the true relationship with government wasn't simply one of corporation and country...
But, they can only get away with that if other people trust them to offer a 0% risk holding instrument. with a 100% success rate.
Otherwise, your gamble is that whatever exchange "gets a bailout" when shit hits the fan.

another reason why centralized exchanges are shit: we can never actually know if the trades are real or not, since they don’t hit the blockchain.
whatever exchange touting over 9,000 accounts could consist of some large % trading bots that simply hold the fees from real users and are pegged to different price points to buy and sell to each other, which would be completely indistinguishable from real trades.
This is a massive advantage for whatever exchange knowing that at some pricepoint there will be more or less automated volume.

Uh, what? No. This is excruciatingly wrong.


"Sell" is the keyword here. This bill has nothing at all to do with selling, it's token to token exchange. You do realize that the math works out the same regarding "owing all the taxes in every coin to coin exchange along the way," right? As OP stated, it just changes WHEN you have to report.
Your basis is what you paid for, and the taxation fluctuates based on capital gains and losses if you did 10 or 10,000,000 transactions. It's how percentage works. The difference here is you currently would have to report all 10,000,000 transactions instead of just "i bought at X" and "I sold at Y." They essentially don't give a shit that you turned X into 10x then lost it down to 1.2X then 0.8X then split it at 0.8 to 100 coins at 0.08X each then made it back up to 1 then sold. The capital gains and losses would be equivalent, and ending up in exactly the same spot means no taxes owed. The difference: 100 less reports for the same outcome.
And so, every "coin to coin" exchange is equivalent up to the sell point depending on your basis.
Simple math: if your tax rate is 20%, you buy in at 2 and exchange to some other token at 10, you'd currently owe 8*.2 = 1.6 because the taxable event was on that exchange even though you received no fiat. THATS what people are fucked for, because they don't actually have any cash, they spent it all on that sweet coin at 2.
If it then drops to 0 / worthlessness, you post a capital gains loss of 10, which cancels out the taxation. 
Likewise, you buy in at 1000 and it goes to 10000 and you trade coins, you are on the hook for 9000 worth, but then it drops to nothing, you post a capital loss and again it deducts and eliminates the taxation on the exchange at 10000.
All this does is get rid of a lot of useless paperwork where you are tracking intermediate steps. You still need to record basis, and you still need to declare that basis when you sell for fiat.
so no, actually do the math and you'll see: the problem with the current method is you needed to pay the taxes up front and people were basically overspending on crypto and didn't have cash to pay for the trades.
If you traded bitcoin for fartcoin at $20,000 that you bought at $1, you'd have to have cash to pay for that transaction even though you realized 0 fiat gains. THAT was the issue.

@_date: 2017-06-02 15:36:04


misleading, since you have a non-trivial amount of time when you have effectively given your coins to coinbase with a promise that they'll hold their end up.
It is usually fast, but sometimes very slow and sometimes cancelled or stuck in pending limbo.
Just use it until it happens to you and you get that sinking feeling that these are no longer your coins.
It is the same with bitpay and a transaction "not going through" within the 15 minute window, and a vendor cancelling your order and telling you to get a refund from bitpay. Thankfully those windows don't matter much (within a 10-30 minute extra window in my experience). But it only takes one "trade" or "use" for you to realize once you hit that send button (or the buy button) you don't possess shit even though you may be the owner.

Nefarious reasons aside:
1. OP said it was $2850 a coin when coinbase was at $2400. That's a nice ~20% markup per transaction.
2. Newbs might say "oh here's that bitcoin, lemme try it out!" 20% on every person sticking a $1 or $5 in there isn't bad. That's even more than a stadium atm fee.
3. visibility never hurts, and that looks "substantial."
4. fun hobby project...
5. small startup to get that legit and up and running.... Localized. The ID is probably needed /used to prove you're not from a different state as the ATM owner likely will only register as MSB in whatever jurisdiction the ATM is.
... on the user end ...
1. you don't have to deal with a person, which can and has gotten ugly.
2. you can do it at your leisure, no scheduling aside from getting to the ATM.
3. If you HODL anyway, you're just buying in at a higher price point. Imagine if you walked up to the atm that was disgustingly selling 1BTC for $50 instead of $30. That would have been a 66% markup, not a ~20% that this is, and I'd slap my grandmother for that deal right now. For all the scams with mining rigs and etc, when you eventually generated the coins you still made a huge profit. not as much as if you would have spent the fiat from the rig on the coin directly, but then you didn't have to worry about sending ids in or dealing with bruisers IRL.
4. novelty. if I ever see a bitcoin ATM i'm definitely putting cash in it and getting some. then putting the receipt in my pants and rubbing it all over my nuts, ahhhh
but, on the file under "stay the fuck away" side of things:
1. lol the ID. KYC?DILLIGAF? I wonder how it confirms or comes back to bite you. What if I show a doctored ID? I can't see how it would verify on the fly since there is no universal standard issue, and what's the use once I'm gone? What if my ID is my passport, verify me?
2. How do I know what the security of whatever going into and out of that machine is? Does everyone who sent in real ID to an exchange really think that's wise?
3. Sounds like it is ripe for honeypot tracking of change
4. someone dumb enough to use one of these and give their address + DOB + other details out to it is just asking to be "engineered." Cellphone taken over, utilities hijacked...
5. maybe it's across from a money laundering front / mall shop, that stays inexplicably open, by the Big Bosses' wife, something where she sells dog skateboards then converts some % of the sales into BTC immediately. Kinda like a cab driver driving around with the meter running and nobody in the cab, or they ask you to use their square and not the cab's credit card system... People pay in cash and the product stays to be resold a dozen times but the "money disappears"
I mean if you're getting philosophical with your "why?" pondering. Why get any bitcoin if you're just going to spend it? there are obvious legal ducking reasons, but otherwise visa/bigbank -&gt; bitcoin -&gt; store is just a silly extra step from visa/bigbank-&gt;store. And as you said you'd do that online anyway (everyone wants to have their own pizza story, "lol i spent 1 bitcoins on $200 worth of Anime storybooks on Steam in 2016")
People are newbs, there are many, many, many levels of adoption and it's only going to get more and more bizarre as more remote places adopt it, like a zimbabwe dude sitting inside an ATM shoveling out 12 inch stacks of paper currency levels of bizarre. I guarantee somewhere in asia there will be a (rigged) electronic gambling machine that pays out in bitcoin as the main vehicle for people converting their fiat to BTC.

It's not bold, it's "money bro" bullshit and then you devolve into lines on graphs navelgazing.
It isn't bold to say there is zero point to having multiple cryptos because you don't need to keep an illusion of "healthy capitalist competition" or "feature set differences" like you do with banks / credit cards.
Crypto is a money replacement, not a "money institution / system" replacement.
You either think that all of the solutions that altcoins propose are solved by L2 solutions with bitcoin, thus obsoleting alts, or you don't.
You also either think that there's no point to all of these shitcoins and they just confuse the market, not legitimize them, or don't.
But saying that bitcoin and "not bitcoin" are some sort of valid force that must perpetually rotate is dumb as fuck. The best case there to extending alts is when you get twittercoin, chasecoin, facebookcoin, whatever.
bitcoin will only lose "popular adoption" if the powers that be force it out of utility with their own popular alt.

"No reason to want privacy unless you're doing something wrong" is such a great argument!

It is a real threat, and bitmain controls some % of total miners "other" that is not distinguishable.
It's simple math based on greed, and the simple math parses out to them destroying themselves in a race to the bottom if they actually could pull the attack off.
Even if they could pull the attack off, the network would simply alienate them via emergency forking.
So it is a subtle distinction between "can it happen" (yes) and "will it happen" (extremely unlikely but not equivalent to 0 chance).
And why that's an issue is due to larger influences. But it would really end up being a minor nuisance in the long run and completely not worth it.

In other words, you're starting with the conclusion and claiming anyone who disagrees is stupid; the discussion is about how you're right and not if you're right. I wonder if that method ever succeeds in making you look well-informed rather than defensive via shitty logic?

Guess what. It's more expensive, the business isn't really getting bitcoin, and it's been tested to cause friction enough to lower sales.


So basically if you want to spend $500 you pay $500+fees+taxes ... cool? 


Just remember, there is no "doing your part." There is no forced meme here. Bitcoin will either be undeniably useful, or it won't. Saying it's useful because you don't mind the premium on fees, rate, and general interaction is not the same as saying it's useful because it is clearly superior in all vectors.
The fact that there is no 3rd party interference by default is great. But then positioning that in the traditional 3rd party interactions is silly. In fact, when you do that you just make a case for fiat + traditional systems "having a place."
Someone selling coins to bitpay could think they're jacking into the matrix and hacking the planet like a cyber-experimenter, but really, all that was done 10 years ago now. The snowball is rolling down the hill, you're not going to win an argument that crypto is more efficient (cost, security or speed) than traditional methods currently.
