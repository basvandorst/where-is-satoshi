Bcash offers nothing in terms of tech over bitcoin. This is a huge problem with the crypto space, as far as coins and transactions go. Many block chains claim to be much better than bitcoin or etherium, while they are just forks of the same tech. There are certain teams and chains that I believe will make improvements and can make a difference, but the reality is that many of them can’t and won’t.
The fact that the only difference between bitcoin and bcash is block size is concerning. This does nothing to help move forward the industry and is imo just a cash grab.

Considering ~~they~~ OP didn’t have to pee on someone, I’d say it’s decent.

I assume if you're asking this you have enough money to be worried about it. Get a hardware wallet.

For real. Slap a “b” on that and we’re finally talking

Simply put, no. Unless I’ve missed something there are no tax incentives for crypto currencies in the US.
Obligatory I’m not a lawyer.
This is NOT a problem though. BTC is taxed per transaction so ideally your employees will understand and treat this exactly like a Roth IRA, pretaxed retirement money, assuming they never convert back to USD. Not only is this better, as I’m almost positive there’s no upper limit on contributions, it’s also untouchable. (Or can be).

Are you not planning on having a vesting schedule?

This statement isn't entirely true. I can very easily setup a wallet on my machine and "hack" bitcoin. Then I just add an entry saying that this address with a lot of bitcoin sent my address a lot of bitcoin.
Now, my "hack" is not successful, but that has to do with the fact that no one else sees my fake transaction. What I would have to do, is convince many of the nodes to believe that this transaction took place. This involves a lot of steps (I don't know all of them), starting with some sort of malware on the nodes that will verify this transaction, good luck guessing which nodes you need to have infected (you could narrow this down by locality I think, again not sure on the specifics of how transactions are verified with bitcoin).
The point is, it's not impossible, just maybe impractical.

No it wasn't.

Pull your head out your ass, there's a difference between being naive and being dumb.

OK, I'm going to grossly simplify all of this but......
A blockchain essentially comes down to a hash (or probably more accurately a checksum). Some value that is computed based off data in such a way that the hash is only replicated with the same exact data (bit level).
What do you foresee this hash being generated from? The executable?  OK, that's a reasonable assumption. When would this be checked? Everytime the game is launched? OK, what if there's no internet connection? It's trivial to overwrite data on your machine. (The hash can just be changed to match a newly generated one.) There's a fairly common saying in computer security that goes something like, "Once they have physical access to the machine none of your security matters."
Blizzard gets around this (kind of) with Starcraft 2 by having you connect to Battle.Net. Thing is, nothing is stopping you from playing offline, (I also bet that people ~~are~~ were playing with "cracked" copies. This would be done by figuring out how keys are generated for the game and submitting those as your keys. We are basically doing this when mining bitcoin, just harder.)
OK, so single player is out (and doesn't even matter that much). Ah multiplayer though, you don't want someone having an unfair advantage. So same thing, you have each game compare hashes to see that they are the same, but wait! The data has to be sent to your machine. What's stopping you from intercepting it and sending back what the other machine "wants" to see? Nothing. Unless....
Age of Empires (2&amp;3, probably 1 as well), and most if not all RTS games, use what's called deterministic lockstep. Which is basically two different machines running the same code, starting from the same initial state, at the same time, and execute messages passed between them to have the same state simulated each frame. Now guess what they do to make sure that no one has mucked with the game code to get infinite money or something? That's right, a hash value (checksum). But wait! "I thought you said I could make the other computer see what I want it to see". Technically that's true. However, calculating the checksum of the current physics state is MUCH more difficult than that of unchanging code in the executable. This is (when you really boil it down) exactly the same idea as blockchain technology.....except this happened in the 90s....which mathematicians and computer scientists already had spent decades on before that. We've known, and we use checksums everywhere.
**Blockchain isn't some "end all be all" tech that's going to save the world, but it is being put to use in new and creative ways and that's good.** Don't believe that it's uncrackable though, the theory is solid, but in practice humans have faults. We build bad systems, we build good systems, but most importantly we are creative and that let's us find the cracks which break down those systems.

I mean, not saying this quote is true but, I remember the internet being wicked slow. Granted it was probably closer to 1997+ since I was so little.

I would not feed the trolls. People replying to you are being ass hats. You're right that blockchain is more than *just* a hash, blockchain and encryption is too big of a topic to include in a single post on Reddit. Plus, I don't have a super deep knowledge of either, my background is mostly game development and some web.
Anyway, you seem genuinely interested in blockchain (and by extension software development) so I **highly** recommend looking into the field more. You're on the right track and I do think that blockchain tech can influence the games industry, I'm just not sure how much of an effect it can truly have.
Regarding your reply with "time as a variable" (paraphrase). It's a good idea, and developers use time in their checksums as well. For instance, passwords are generally salted and hashed for encryption, using a timestamp to help generate the encryption was used (at least by amateur devs, including myself).
Like I said though, join us. The field is very fulfilling and pays well.
