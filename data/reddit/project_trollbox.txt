By investing in the bitcoin ecosystem they are making sure that the currency will be worth investing in. When the time is right they will start buying. I think Fred Wilsion own somewhere between 500-1000 if I remember correctly

She was an extremely attractive young lady. I was actually in NYC visiting with a lovely woman I have been seeing for some time now so I did not get her number. I pretty much just had my mind blown by the whole situation because what are the odds of running into someone that is involved with BTC in the first place.

It is bad news because spending actually causes the price to drop. The actual suicide girls need to have a reason to want to be paid in bitcoin so that suicidegirls .com starts to hold bitcoin instead of "cashing out".

Actually this will allow artists to use  token-based access. Say you go to their site and they are selling downloads for $10 and shirts for $20 but if you have 100 of their coins they could offer those items to you at a discount. Maybe $5 and $10. They could even allow you access to special content. Creates a whole new way for artists and fans to interact.

I'm really excited about this. I used to flip a lot of vinyl records and I kinda feel like this will be the same thing. When a record came out that was by an unknown band and say limited to 1000 copies I would by like 10 and wait for them to get popular. That's gonna be the same situation and I think this will bring a lot of new people into crypto.

I bought a Roland Gaia with half a BTC here in 2013. So paid $500 for the Gaia. It’s now worth prolly $400 while half a BTC is almost $5k now. Face palm... but I do enjoy the Gaia. It’s a very fun Synth and  despite the hate it gets I think you can dial in some sweet sounds.

We need to start funding for an add featuring Artie. He could tell everyone that bitcoin is the strongest currency in the world.
@_date: 2015-09-27 19:31:34
I think a big part of the back lash about 21inc is
 Because of how well funded they are and a lot of people just want to get rich off bitcoin and they expected them to do something magical to improve the price. I'm sure most just wish that the $121 million they raised was just used to pump the price of bitcoin. There is the other group that thinks that it is just extremely over priced.
 I think the best break down was at $237 for the parts... That price does not included their software being factored in and also I have seen people sell flash drives with the entire blockchain on it for around $30. So if you factor that stuff in and the amount of time you would spend tracking all that stuff down and then building it your self it may be worth it to just by their product. Now if you don't plan on trying to use it for development then it does not make much since to buy one if you ask me. 
I saw a talk with their CEO about how one of the biggest problems with bitcoin is getting people to develop things to make it more useful. I think that is apart of the plan with this device along with all the "Internet if things" talk. So it might be best to sit this one out until the consumer model comes out which I'm sure will be cheaper.

So he is not sure. He is a good dude but he would definitely drink a lot at night and go on gambling binges late at night. In 2011 the government here in the USA started cracking down on gambling sites. He is not sure if he did download anything. He said that he thinks he might have. Problem is that he has since wiped that computer. So I'm hoping they were not on there. I'm just not sure what all web wallets existed in 2011.

I don't really think bitcoin is very appealing for the average person right now. It's still the early days of the technology. It has a while to go before it is easier to use. I personally think there is a lot of room for the price to go up. The higher the price the more useful Bitcoin becomes and the less volatility it has. I use it to make online purchase for band merch from hello merch. It's not that I really think it's better or easier then PayPal but I prefer Bitcoin over having to get out my debit card. It's still a developing technology and it has many potential use cases. If you are really curious about it just buy like ten buck so mess around with. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 04:14:22
Yeah, this does really seem like a useful service. I also think it could be useful for so many people. People often under value themselves and how much use they could provide to other people with their knowledge.

He has since wiped his computer and I also had him check his email accounts for wallet back ups but no luck there. I guess I'm hoping they are still on some web based wallet that is still around and that they were not on some exchange that has gone under or wiped from his computer

The mining chip is there because the end goal is to have the mining chip built into everything. So your TV mines a small about of bitcoin and than when you watch some streaming service the content created gets made directly with bitcoin.

I have really started to notice the hate for altcoins. I remember reading a blog post from Gavin Anderson about how they are a waste of talent. I have noticed with dogecoin that it brings some quality to crypto that people who did not get it at first are starting to understand. If dogecoin is the gateway drug to bitcoin it will only help the cause. Many currencies such wow
