Are they actually using Counterparty? The repo seems to be inactive of late.

This service should come with a BIG DISCLAIMER. All private keys are generated server-side. I don't care if you encrypted seeds etc, fact is you have control over every users funds! I would also note that editing your security section of your website while I'm read/interpreting it doesn't provide me with any confidence.

This is awful. Pair automatically = the QR generated is so dense the iphone can't pick it up. Pair manually - the keyboard opens on top of the identifier and password inputs meaning it is impossible for me to copy and paste my 32 character password.

Does anyone know where they source coins?

Hmm worried that these guys are storing private keys. BE CAREFUL!
There is no client side javascript handling the generation of keys, it appears to be done server side.

How can I get in on the funding round? Cryptoequity guys! Or at least let the little guy in through platforms like seedrs or crowdcube.

Just tried this out with a £100 purchase, which is the current daily limit for cards. I tried with a a VISA Barclaycard (credit) and they declined the transaction and then contacted me to check for fraud - I was then instructed that they will text me when I can re execute the transaction. I then tried a Santander debit card and the transaction went through but again I was contacted by the bank for a fraud check. In the end I managed to get £100 buy through but what a hassle.

timparsa any plans for multisig support? Realtime transparency is one thing, but I would like to have at least shared (at best ultimate) control over my funds, perhaps by having 1 of 2 keys? 'Bank wallets' such as coinbase/bitreserve, are all waving signs to HACKERS, why make yourself a target when solutions exist for users to hold their own keys. Oh and are you guys insured?

timparsa my concern is that bitreserve like any hosted wallet service is a target.  Consumers will see your service and think: 'oh my god cheap remittance', 'transacting between asset classes is awesome' - i certainly did, even participated in the latest fund raising round. But where's the protection when things go wrong? If bitreserve is hacked tomorrow, transparency doesn't matter the coins are gone. If your system worked off a shared key approach, or like coinbase has a separate service like the coinbase vault, hackers would also have to hack me as well as you. Given that insurance seems to be a no go, surely every opportunity should be taken to remove the single point of failure/compromise which is the bitreserve wallets.

The fees are cheap and the website is far superior to all other competitors! I ask everyone to give kraken a go - you'll see how awesome it is.

I heard santander.

What about Saturns? We're still loyal customers that might not have as much disposable income...

What a complete misrepresentation of bitcoin. It's so hard getting financial people to understand bitcoin, all they want to do is compare it to fiat currencies!
