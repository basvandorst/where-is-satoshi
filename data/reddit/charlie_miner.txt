This bull market is causing havoc at work. 
Portfolio is up by 400% across the board. I kept hearing Buble talk a while ago but now it's over. The moment bitcoin futures start trading whales will be all over the place.

Fasten your seatbelts boy, next stop the moon!

Take a look at bitlish. They provide software based ATMs so no hardware required
