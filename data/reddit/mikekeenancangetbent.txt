It probably is, the only number for sure I do remember is the 2k BTC. Didn’t really know much about it  
Edit: meant 2k not 2000k lol damn that’d be a lot.

A buddy of mine bought $4000 worth in 2009 or 10 and has about 2000 BTC. His family at first mocked him and were harsh on him, granted he was in high school. He’s worth about 14m now. I didn’t agree with it but I supported him through it, and ever since we’ve watched BTC rise and rise. He moved to NY and is going to college there for Business and Trade, even sent me 50 BTC as a gift, and he wouldn’t let me take no for an answer. I didn’t want to take his money that he earned. Guess the moral of the story is if someone knows what they’re doing and believe in it, give them all the support you can give, even if you don’t believe it yourself.

The only number I for sure remember is the 2k BTC, didnt really know anything about Bitcoin back then, all I remember also is trying to talk him out of it but gave up cause I saw how much of a big deal it was to him and how much it made him happy

I just realized I said 2000k and not 2k. Am dumb. Idk what or how he did because I didn’t know jack about it then and I actually tried to talk him out of it but low and behold I’m super wrong about it

Yea actually this helps a lot. I’ve been buying a small amount (5-20$) last few weeks just to get started. How will I know IF I get B2x? I use Coinbase and Blockchain wallets

Friend of mine bought and mined around 2k coins back in 2013, now he’s worth 10m. Upsetting part? He told me to buy 1 or 2 coins when they were 13$. I would’ve but didn’t have a job then, and didn’t know much lol. RIP me
