It was a joke man. That's all the dude talks about on his show. It's like "Hey do you ever smoke DMT? It's amazing your ego just blah blah blah, yeah I guess you're right Milo, why shouldn't the age of consent be 14?"

The government literally owns the gold and silver mines ding-dong

Bruh most of the gold of antiquity never even left the coffers. Coinage was rare and currency was only useful as a unit of account for debts i.e. people kept debts in units of currency, but never paid them back in units of currency, but rather in-kind with other goods. Very few people actually HAD any gold because it was so overvalued due to scarcity... starting to sound familiar? 
Also, you had to have a vast supply of it if you wanted to issue an effective currency. The US had FIVE recessions between 1890 and 1905 for trying to protect their gold reserves. Nah man, gold did not work well.

Well than I supposed I wouldn't want to pay them either. But I live in a functioning society with healthcare, schools, roads, and public protection, so I guess I don't mind them so much

Indeed it was, but you must have stopped reading after that because you completely missed my point. The point was that it didn't circulate. Charlemagne's money was 'used' as an appraisal value for goods 300 years after it had stopped circulating.

And Bitcoin is backed by...?
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:31:26
Bitcoiners are intractable ideologues. Pointing out facts will not shake them from their assertion that all banks are evil, Jew-run organizations that are actively trying to destroy the world. The far right wing ideology of Bitcoin is ingrained and tbh, terrifying. 
Also, ding-dong DeflinGuy has probably never heard of fractional reserve banking when he talk about all the money they make up, and how that literally helps currency stay stable and not ridiculously volatile like Bitcoin.

What backed gold was that people had agreed to use it as a store of value, albeit not a terribly good one. It wasn't widely circulated, was heavy and costly to transport, few governments had real access to it, and contrary to most of its enthusiasts, suffered from price variations just like post-standard "fiat" and was pinned to a certain value by government policy. Trying to maintain the gold standard led to something like 5 recessions in a thirty year period at the end of the 19th century. 
Bitcoin isn't like gold or fiat not because it's superior, but because no one uses it as a store of value. 1) it fluctuates far to widely to be used as one 2) it's not intuitive to use 3) governments won't accept it for taxes and most merchants won't accept it for goods 3a) the merchants that will accept it for goods do not accept ONLY bitcoin, rather they view bitcoin as an asset worth a certain amount in another currency.
It's a great feat of engineering, but it's shitty money. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:40:40
I presume wherever you live, that you have roads and schools, emergency services etc which are funded by taxes?
@_date: 2018-06-13 01:38:00
So the solution to making enough Bitcoin for everyone is to hyper-inflate it (making the standard reference smaller)? Doesn't this kind of go against the whole bloody point? I mean, it's going happen anyway, if Bitcoin is to become the world currency, with only 21 mln to go around and billions of people on the planet... You cannot expect it to be a reasonable form of international account as a currency and not have its value change...
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:49:12
I'm sorry I don't quite understand (not being sarcastic), how can you say that bitcoin's value will not matter and simultaneously that it will fluctuate due to market forces? If it's in a market, it will matter. At some point it has to fulfill a debt for a physical good or tangible service. People decide how many silver florins a goat is worth, not the other way round.

How is forking the chain to make more currency available philosophically differ from printing more money? I'm not being snarky, I'm legit interested. Bit of a newb here. Other it not being centralized, why is willful deflation of currency to provide liquidity philosophically less palatable than inflation for the same reason? If I've understood correctly, that's what your above statement would suggest right? Making BTC worth more, so that the fractions are consequently worth more, and therefore there's more 'digital gold' available to people?
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:42:39
I don't think you read my question very carefully. In your example, you would effectively be artificially deflating the currency (changing the nature of the thing) to meet market demand for a useful record of account. Philosophically, how is that any different than artificially inflating currency to achieve the same goal i.e. provide a sufficient available account for debt, which is currency?
One of the biggest arguments by bitcoiners is that there is a fixed amount of the thing, and that it rescues the whole world from the big bad evil bankers that just want to make your paycheck worth nothing (even at face value a ridiculous argument). Deflation comes with its own set of similar problems... 
@_date: 2018-06-18 23:36:20
The energy that is consumed to mine for bitcoin and solve the proof-of-work puzzles is completely assinine. 
The energy needed to print fiat is infinitesimal compared to mining. It wrecks electricity markets for residents and uses irreplaceable natural resources so some hardware corporation can win money we made up on the internet. I understand that it's a major feat of engineering, but philosophically it's stupid.   
I have no idea how you can say "Think about it from the most fundamental human value level - what do we need? Food, water and electricity - all sources of energy." and simultaneously advocate proof-of-work as the end-all of backing for a currency (it's not). If anything, mining is to humanity like those old prohibition advertisements in the US that run something like "Buying a whiskey is taking food out of the mouth of your child." Food, water, energy, you have correctly identified those as necessary. What is not necessary -- digital currency.

"Stores of value do not need to be involitaile to be stores of value. They merely need to store value over long periods of time. Like gold."
"You don't really understand money."

Also, if your bar to clear for knowing anything about bitcoin is to draw a merkle tree, it kind of shows how non-intuative the currency is yeah?

The US government exerts lots of control over the gold supply in the United States. When the gold standard was still a thing, or waaaaay back, when gold coinage was still a thing, the gold supply was heavily controlled by governments. It was practically the Spanish Empire's foreign policy was "get gold" then subsequently "do fuck all with it" and that's how you got the story of Don Quixote.

I never said it was...
@_date: 2018-04-19 03:14:56
It doesn't. Very few people who own Bitcoin use it as a currency at all. The only reason it's as popular as it is, is because its use as a security can make you rich (could have if you bought in 2011). These tech idiots who think a digital anarcho-capitalist future is going to save the world are delusional. Tokenizing every interaction is not intuitive, expensive, and irrational when a system already exists. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:55:42
Of course he does, he's a shitheel anarcho-capitalist. Companies should be able to do whatever they want until they affect him negatively. That's what happens when your garbage ideology is so singular it turns man into an island.

Not at all. It's a matter of importance to your income. Deciding not to consume a certain type of media isn't the same as a platform undercutting the amount of income you can make (in Ver's case through advertising).

That's completely inane. Black market trades existed when money was still based on the "absolute value" of gold and silver.

I understand what you're getting at but I think  is still right. If he wanted to criticise them for being corporatists who are using their position in marketing to unfairly manipulate prices or pooh-pooh on an idea they don't like; that'd be legitimate. On the other hand, for Ver to say it's an issue of censorship and freedom of speech just seems terribly disingenuous coming from an admitted anarcho-capitalist. A bit obvious he's having a hard time swallowing his own rubbish ideology. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 00:21:45
I did. Thing is though is that it's a garbage reactionary ideology. Show me one anarcho-capitalist who gets treated like rubbish by a company they rely on and just says "Well, that's the free market" and shrugs. You don't understand how he could think it, because it hasn't happened as badly to you yet. Hasn't cut as deep into your bottom line. The whole ideology is feudalism re-purposed for modern times. Of course you don't get it, because you're not the lord getting knocked off the throne, but a (if I'm gonna stretch this metaphor) rather someone attempting to garner favor at court.
