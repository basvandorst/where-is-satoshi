So right now standard network fee is 33 sat / byte. I can change it to custom 1 sat / byte but the trade off is longer wait time right? I'm guessing the first twitter link tell me how much time I need to wait? But will it be six hour, half day, etc.? Paying 3-5 sat/ byte decrease wait time by a bit?

Is the current price dip enough or are we looking at 3-4k usd?
@_date: 2019-07-27 14:42:23
Ah yes I plan to buy and hold as well. Thanks for reinforcing it. I guess I did mention trades in my post but I just wanted to cover my bases.
@_date: 2019-07-28 14:39:28
Does it matter if I hold the coins in the segwit or native segwit?
Like if an exchange doesnt support native segwit yet and I can only transfer coins to the segwit wallet. Does it have any benefit to transfer coins from segwit to native segwit within the ledger live?

Sorry what does TA mean? Technical analysis?
@_date: 2019-07-28 13:02:55
If I remember correctly you just need to go into portfolio, add account, check the option that says Bitcoin 1 (native segwit) then create. Now you can test it out by going to receive and see if the address starts with bc1

Ah thank you very much. It's all clear now. I'm trying to send from segwit to native segwit within ledger live and the network fee is 33sat / byte. Isn't that really high?
Also you have opened another flood gate about lightning channel lol. Is it for tipping here in reddit?
@_date: 2019-07-28 15:06:24
Thank you. My goal is to buy and hold. If I already had to receive coins with the segwit address, I'm already charged the higher fee right? Then I don't really need to send it to the native segwit address if it's just gonna stay there for a long time.
Also how do I go about sending coins from segwit to native segwit in ledger live? I don't seem to see that option.

When you buy gold, do you buy the physical gold or some sort of investment instrument? I'm inexperienced. Thanks
@_date: 2019-08-22 07:48:46
What does this mean exactly?
@_date: 2019-08-08 00:16:52
so that receiving address will reveal how much i have in total? and not just the amount donated to that address alone?

Which plate did you buy? Did you also buy engraver?
@_date: 2019-08-08 00:38:45
That's what I'm confused about. Someone above mentioned that any address I generate from ledger live can be used to view total holdings of my original account.
What did you mean by create a new address?
@_date: 2019-08-06 21:43:28
Thanks! Can I look up confirmations with something like receiving addresses on my ledger S on  ?
@_date: 2019-08-08 18:55:42
thanks! when you said bitcoin address is derived from bitcoin public key, it's meant for both receiving and sending address? are the receiving and sending address the same or different numbers?
@_date: 2019-08-20 15:08:51
Everytime I click on btc related Twitter I see the Adam btc tweet about btc give away from Coinbase on top. It's a scam right?

Which site did that come from?
@_date: 2019-08-08 01:20:08
When you said reuse addresses, you mean reusing the receiving addresses generated by wallets such as ledger live in my case? 
Since ledger live generate new receiving address every time I unplug and plug in my ledger nano, this aspect of not reusing addresses is covered right?
Thank you

Sorry what is confirmation? How do I view it on blockchain? I use shakepay and transfer btc to ledger S right away. I'm not sure where or when the "confirmation" is supposed to happen.

New to crypto game here. I'm an unsophisticated hodler but I have developed the habit to read and consume btc media. 
Should I be trying to set up this lightning thing? So far I have seen it used for tipping in btc subs.   
Am I missing out some values if I don't get on lightning network?
@_date: 2019-08-21 17:38:12
Hi I have been using your site to track price. Neat and simple. I'm new so I still don't understand the volume part on the bottom. 
Does red mean a net positive of btc sold? Say if it's red 20mil meaning during hour 40mil sold and 20mil bought of btc? And vice versa for green?
When the volume stick is red do we always expect a price dip?
Thank you

you mean the process of transferring balance wasn't painless? Or just the general experience of using trezor wasn't good?
@_date: 2019-09-16 19:53:40
Sadly not the micro usb cables. I just checked the price and the nano s is 89cad vs trezor one 71cad. Does the ledger nano s have better functionalities for its price? Most of the comments I have seen people preferred the trezor more than ledger in general...
edit: found another cable. still no luck
