I have bought btc from coinbase and chase.  I think they only have a problem if it is over $5000

Depends how long you want to wait. The slider goes from 5% to 33%. If you want something quickly go for 10%-15%. If you don't mind waiting days to weeks, go 15%-20%. If you don't mind waiting months go 20%-33%. I've got things at every discount, it is all about how fast you need something from Amazon buy paying with bitcoin at

Doesn't pass Virustotal, official one. No need to upgrade yet.

Fiat (USD) values don't show your balance properly, fix the bug. 3.05 worked fine.

Just own both assets. That is the safest and smartest thing to do. Gold will never go away till asteroid mining, it has been money that holds it's value for 5000 years. No fiat holds value or exists after a few hundred years. Bitcoin is great, but is very risky, no one know if it will exist in 1, 5, 20, 50 years or how much it will be worth. It's like buying a penny stock, could be the next Amazon or Google, but 99% of them go to zero. Owning both will let you win out regardless of which wins as the future store of value, or if they both do. I think they both can co-exist well.

But as one user pointed out he was able to see visual basic scripts, I could not, I saw just blank page asking to enable edit. So I guess if you saw scripts, enabled edit, and told it to run, then you are probably infected. But now the question is infected with what? If someone did all this, please report what your anti-virus programs are finding or what the script is trying to do.

I opened it and it was blank. I have run it thru Virustotal, Windows defender, Avast, EEK, Malware antibytes, and Anti-spyware. Absolutely no hits at all, computer working fine, and no requests from zone alarm or windows for access to anything or asking for internet allow/deny from zone alarm firewall. So it appears safe if you opened it. I could imagine there might be some exploit on a specific version of Microsoft office, as I am still on 2007. But I see no malware at all, just a blank document that said you have to turn on editing, which I didn't even see an option for.

Seems shady. How long have they been in business? Any details on history? And why can't you buy btc there?
