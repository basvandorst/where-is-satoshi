I just replied to moolah_ elsewhere.  The lack of professionalism is disheartening.  I mean this as someone who wishes any entrepreneur well.
One of the suggestions I left him is to hire good PR to handle the social media.  I'm old enough to know that people like myself (IT with good social skills) is an extreme rarity and in most cases, CEO or not if you come from a techie background you should not talk to people.
The responses in this thread and the video are proof in the pudding.

Come to Canada and buy a cell phone.  There's also something called collusion where if all companies agree to not undercut eachother prices don't have to go down.

our version of the FCC has less balls than yours and is essentially run by ex-business folk from the businesses it overseas.  Plus you couple that with a large nation with only 30million people and 4 big players.  Depending on where you live most areas you have a choice of 2 internet providers, Rogers and Bell.  Both are renouned for shit customer service because why do you need customer service when you have 50/50 odds someone is going to be your customer?
Seriously the Cable/Internet/Phone/Mobile market up here is extremely shit.
Also, on the slim chance we allow competition from other markets (Sprint most recently) they end up being undercut by the big boys and then bought out by the same players to eat up the spectrums they won in auctions.  Sprint Canada was swallowed by Rogers.
ugh.  I could go more in depth if I had the inclination or the time but the gist is that Canada is fucked in terms of competition and it's not changing anytime soon.

Jesus you have any doge left?  lol.  I'm getting tired upvoting all your tips :)

I'm happily distant in cryptocurrency (have a few doge socked away for fun) but I have to comment on this - 


There's a reason in the corporate world we have controlled media relations not to mention people with experience to know what they're saying and the audience they're saying it to.
I've watched the leaked youtube vid and I've been reading your responses here.  The unprofessionalism is outstanding and I don't hold you to blame.  I don't know your career path before moolah.io but in all likelihood your business experience is probably going through a lot of growing pains.
I wish your company the best of luck but seriously you need to look into:
a - replacing yourself with a hired PR person who will control the social media aspect of your company
b - treat your business like a business.  This means act the part.  Work on the professionalism.  A glaring example of this would be having a business meeting (which this youtube vid was about) and smoking an e-cig, being extremely glib and most importantly, allowing yourself to be put in a situation where what should probably be a private meeting is recorded and then dumped online.
The last point in b&gt; if anything speaks to the professionalism of the people you're "working" with.
I don't question your talent, but it would seem a lot of people in the crypto-currency industry have a lot to learn about how to properly run all aspects of a business.  Resounding proof, IMHO of the problem when you have developers, who are renowned social retards, thrusting themselves into entrepreneurial roles which inevitably mean interacting with people.
Anyways, my 2 cents take them for what they are.

goddamnit then you're not Toronto!
I work IT for a company that's managing around 150billion$.  I'm going to dig around at work to see where some common holes could be.  Have a 9-5 job though so don't expect any fast results.

I'm with you.  Merely as an observer to the process (don't care to get into market speculation when I have 3 kids to feed) what Bitcoin needs is both a quality exchange as well as hard rules to the whole market.

hmmmm... running PHP
So highly likely you're running off a LAMP.
Let me dig in my toolbox some more on possible combinations of what the hardware/software could be and the standard variations for naming.
Security is only as tight as the laziest developer.  Let's see how lazy your developers are :)
FYI I"m at Queen/Yonge where abouts are you guys?  Beer?
