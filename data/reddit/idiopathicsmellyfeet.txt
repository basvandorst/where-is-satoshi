That wouldn't help. It would also be keylogged

Why do you have to spend btc to run one?
@_date: 2018-09-24 14:01:41
No. I already stated that my intention was to sell the btc
@_date: 2018-09-23 16:32:32
I seriously think there was nothing wrong with Electrum just to be clear..
@_date: 2018-09-23 18:20:14
I'm sure with me was not the case. At least physically. It might have been some online acquaintance. Sharing is caring. Keep it safe
@_date: 2018-09-23 16:01:09
It was a ledger nano. Problem is I entered the mnemonic into electrum
@_date: 2018-09-24 14:00:46
Thanks for being reasonable
@_date: 2018-09-23 16:57:46
I know. Which doesn't eliminate the fact that it was stolen from me.
@_date: 2018-09-06 18:41:27
But it also takes some btc to open channels or not?
@_date: 2018-09-06 17:17:40
I saw a tutorial video about running a node that made you spend some btc.. I'll check again.. any tutorial you can recommend me?
@_date: 2018-09-23 16:28:39
Thanks. I used it before but never for crypto
@_date: 2018-09-23 16:44:04
Yes, windows. I'm not asking for sympathy, just telling my story to make others aware
@_date: 2018-09-24 14:01:12
Thank you, take care as well. I appreciate your comment
@_date: 2018-09-23 16:51:35
Thanks for the kind words. It was about to get on my nerves. I accepted my mistake and am moving on. All the best to you too
@_date: 2018-09-23 16:10:41
Why greed? Now we see it was the right move. Core can also be compiled maliciously, ledger I had. There was no issue with electrum. I'm sure it was a keylogger
@_date: 2018-09-23 16:01:22
The official

@_date: 2018-09-23 16:26:44
I got over it. My friends as well. Left and right in the crypto community you hear all kinds of thefts and hacks. Man in the middle attack is more common than appears. I decided to post here to share an example of how simple can it be to lose all coins. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 18:51:46
I'm already back. Thanks
@_date: 2018-09-23 17:13:57
I had the ledger in a safe deposit box in another country but I knew the seed phrase by heart, that's why I imported it to Electrum in order to be able to move funds because I wanted to sell.
@_date: 2018-09-23 16:02:13
I didn't know that..
@_date: 2018-09-23 18:22:22
It was hard. One of the friends lost only 1000 € of his initial investment. The other two lost 10k +.. they understand though: neither I will manage funds again nor they will accept to have their funds managed.
@_date: 2018-09-23 17:32:41
Windows 10, updated and Avira. Plus Malwarebytes, adwcleaner, rkill, etc which I ran very often
@_date: 2018-09-01 16:12:54
Biiiiiit conneeeeeect
@_date: 2018-09-23 16:03:39
Importing a wallet using the mnemonic
@_date: 2018-09-24 15:57:21
don't sweat it. I won't either. good day
@_date: 2018-09-23 16:03:01
The ledger was in a safe in another country and I knew the mnemonic by heart. The point was to sell the funds
@_date: 2018-09-23 18:15:07
And your response right here is why Bitcoin cannot be globally adopted in its current state. I agree with you though, now that I've learned where I did wrong.
@_date: 2018-09-01 17:51:56
Besides supporting the network do you get anything out of running it? Any rewards I mean
@_date: 2018-09-23 16:08:54
I didn't have the ledger with me. I looked for a good wallet where I can import the seed and found electrum
@_date: 2018-09-23 17:20:46
Nobody had physical access to my computer. I was vocal about Bitcoin and a lot of my friends knew but that's why I didn't keep the ledger with me and instead in a safe. I suspect about who did it, someone I met online and briefly worked on a project and then suddenly disappeared. Anyway, I can't prove it.
@_date: 2018-09-23 16:41:14
Like I said, mistake learned. If you want to call it greed because it was in December, like you originally stated, that's fine. I moved on.
@_date: 2018-09-24 13:52:36
I don't know for sure
@_date: 2018-09-23 17:11:52
I'm not replying per argument because it just sounds like you want to attack me. I already admitted a mistake, don't need to punch me down. Instead I'll ask you: why do you think Bitcoin struggles global adoption? Maybe because you need to be such a geek and 'computer literate' in order not to lose anything. Why fucking bother to that then when there are banks and credit cards and insurance companies? Why do you think I was handling funds from 3 different friends? Maybe because they have no idea how to use Bitcoin but they wanted in. Instead of calling me out for several mistakes which I dumb down to one, why don't you take your superiority elsewhere and leave this thread to whoever wants to learn about risks in crypto.
@_date: 2018-09-23 16:01:41
I'm not doing that..
@_date: 2018-09-06 14:24:13
How much did you spend to run it?
@_date: 2018-09-24 14:00:24
That's not how it works. I imported the funds to another wallet, they are not in the ledger anymore.
@_date: 2018-09-23 18:35:17
Teach that to everyone that wants to use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-23 18:33:54
It was a Thinkpad. No idea how it got placed, but I exchanged files with someone that I suspect. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 18:18:44
Well I also lost a lot of nano on bitgrail and nobody refunded me
@_date: 2018-09-06 14:23:20
Any proof of that 10000 btc short?
@_date: 2018-08-26 22:41:48
@_date: 2018-09-23 17:02:55
They were sent initially to one address and then moved to hundreds of different ones
@_date: 2018-08-23 11:27:00
Probably low fee, will confirm eventually.
@_date: 2018-08-23 11:17:58
And it's something that will probably happen or not really? It's a way to speculation without having it, right?
@_date: 2018-08-26 22:48:10
I can see a possible drop incoming but not as low as $1000. End of the year I'd guess 10k, not more.
@_date: 2018-08-23 11:22:20
And that's it? Won't they try again?
@_date: 2018-08-23 11:28:23
@_date: 2018-08-23 10:44:36
Eli5: what is ETF and why is it important? I'm out of the loop
@_date: 2018-08-23 13:32:06
Thanks for the explanation
@_date: 2019-03-02 09:07:42
He's right once again
@_date: 2019-03-02 09:08:44
I'm a bull, that's what matters
@_date: 2018-10-24 15:03:13
Probably Wirex
@_date: 2019-03-02 09:10:01
Bl3p was always perfect for me
@_date: 2018-10-11 11:18:15
Is that what you would do? Fucks sake..
@_date: 2018-10-31 19:36:24
Yeah... Not really
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:38:50
Thanks, it's a lot of input but it answered my questions.
@_date: 2018-11-18 16:54:05
How about the fees and rewards?
How do you reply to this: 
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:50:28
@_date: 2018-11-03 16:09:10
So maybe look for local banks. I'd do it for you no problem, for a symbolic fee. I can give any documents and ID you want. But yeah I understand I'm a stranger and this is delicate. Anyway, good luck
@_date: 2018-11-03 15:51:21
I thought it was global, but maybe it's only EU. You can try N26, also online German bank
@_date: 2018-11-03 15:05:52
Get a Dutch bank account online in your name (bunq) and then use Sepa to transfer to Ireland
Edit: this is only in Eur. You can sell Bitcoin to bunq via bitvavo or bitonic or bl3p.eu
