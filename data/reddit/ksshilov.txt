Yes sure. I guess it could be said about each addition to any blockchain ;) (Not any of course, but most of it).

Great psychological questions) Thanks. Will be great if you could ask something more specific. Are you a trader?

Wow, thanks a lot for that. It seems a lot of info about crypto market manipulation and all that pump and dump groups. Are there any tools that could help to track such manipulation? (It should be something where you could track transactions of a lot of different people buying something common - it seems not too hard to find such templates in blockchain)

Thanks for the link - great source btw. But the blockchain experts in my link is not only developers. I think for someone who build products in crypto - it’s really valuable to read thinkers it helps to see on the problems with the new side.

You can write an article or just share your current posts and we could add you to the list if the community will vote. I guess it will help you to distribute more expertise

Thanks, and what do you think about the format? Will you read the structured list of questions and answers on separate website?

It's not, but the reality and incentive show that it is. Ok, so you own 51% of mining power, and do you really want to create parallel chain just to double spend? We can calculate the profit of it..

It’s not just a linked list as we know ;)

Thanks, I think it’s a psychology of huge amount of traders  - concentration on money. What do you think about that?

Just add your list in comments - who do you think write interesting and in-depth articles? (Of course, we all know - Andreas Antonopoulos and Jimmy Song) But I'm looking for the new authors, who write often and interesting.
