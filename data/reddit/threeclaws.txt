0-20% depending on tax bracket is the long term cap gains tax.
And the irs views mined bitcoins as income and purchased/given bitcoins as assets, so the former would be taxed at your normal tax rate and the latter cap gains if you held on for more than a year.

I might be misremembering but I thought that only applied to the giver not the taker.

He gets his drugs from a hot dealer who he also sleeps with, it's a plot point to give him a love interest that seems to be just as screwed up as he is in contrast to his childhood friend who seemingly has it all together and is therefore out of his league.

Did, which again was a device to further the story and his relationship with her. He also cut off his own supply to protect her.

To be fair. It is not uncommon, at least it wasn't a short while ago, for malware to install miners to make use of the computer. So for the average computer user this is a benefit but in this case AVG should probably ask before removing it or at least just quarantine it.

When doing this during the run up in 05/06/07 all I checked for was FDIC insurance, for bitcoins it is far more complicated than that since you have people regularly on both sides saying a company is either fantastic or a scam.
I have my coins, what little I have, with blockchain and I always felt fairly secure with them and I never really heard anything negative. Then a few months ago I started seeing comments left and right on here about how they were in trouble. There wasn't enough cash on the line for me to freak out and in the end nothing happened to me personally but I can easily see how the panic can quickly become noise.

Not a great example since they effectively did, the goal was to prevent another napster and to that end they were successful.
Same goes for bitcoin, would you a US citizen still be able to hold crypto? Yes. Would you be able to, in the US, buy good and services with it? Maybe, but it would be incredibly difficult if the US decided to just outlaw it and would push crypto even further to the fringes then it already is.
I don't think this guy is going to gain traction but he's on the right track to get there, convincing the current administration that there is a chance that the world could move away from the dollar and you'll see movement against crypto.
