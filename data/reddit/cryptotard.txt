ooohhh sounds serial. You sure it was brigading and not just a, you know, "vote"?


^ pass this guy some more tinfoil


I just checked the price - nup not working. Spam and shills only have temporary effects. Hey there's a thought, maybe people just hate spam?
@_date: 2014-11-21 14:04:05
Like I said, it could hardly be considered "brigading" except by the most anal interpretation:








@_date: 2014-11-21 16:01:59
Great idea. So sort of like a pyramid scheme but backed by a spam model?
Count me in!

What's "fishy" about it? It's patently obvious that not everyone knew that bitbytip was a shill, what's wrong with spreading the word? Now the same user is doing the same thing with a different username. Business ethics?
@_date: 2014-11-27 00:14:38


ummmm no. But nice pyramid scheme. At least the icon is kind of accurate
@_date: 2014-11-27 00:25:11
wow thats awesome. Have you decided how you will spend the three pennies you made?

Yes. "Fix" being the operative word

"get rid of and at extremely low prices." is exactly the same as "give shit away"
The fact that you had to introduce the term "discount" in order to discredit me is a huge clue that you are clueless.
To put it more succinctly - you are a pump and dump fuckwit
Any questions please let me know

You should seriously consider throwing yourself off a bridge - you have nothing whatsoever to contribute to society.
Failing that we can all contribute a nickel for your trailer park fees for this month while you go out and find a job. THEN you can enjoy the freedom.

But thats just a front, the actual company Cryptsy is registered in Belize through a virtual office.
Makes it easier for the getaway I suppose?
Is the FL office virtual as well?

Former skeptic here. It took a few things to realize I was wrong. The juvenile libertard echo chamber chanting started to turn me into an advocate. The barrage of changetip spam sent me closer.
But really it's just the price that turned me into a bitcoin lover. The steady slide down in 2014 from the giddy high makes it obvious that bitcoin is heading in one and only one direction. i.e Moon
So I've put all my savings into bitcoin and am going forth to accost people and spread the gospel. Hopefully I can get a big payout before it all collapses.
@_date: 2014-11-18 08:19:08


Are you really that naive/stupid? This is a Nigerian 419 scam and you'd have to be a complete moron to fall for it because it is so well known and obvious.
I'm not surprised to see that you're a bitcoin bagholder.
