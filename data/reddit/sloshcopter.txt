Apple has a lot of money.  Why not buy bitcoin and then help it succeed lol they have a lot of ways to win they don't have to win every battle by destroying everyone else

Is there a master list of ideas people could be working on to help bitcoin?  I feel like people from all walks have ideas that other people could specialize in but don't have the idea themselves.  global conciseness, brainchain 
p.s  does anyone see a future blockchain of human knowledge that can store all of our memory information at the same time and be parsed for reality, the truth, ideas.

ronald mcdonald house, red cross, st. jude, salvation army, ymca, boys and girls club, boy scouts, girl scouts, united services organization, united way, marine toys for tots
these people would do good for the bitcoin brand.  lots of people recognize these organizations.

Well i think there is a large "weird spectrum" here in the valley.  Some are worse.
In noway am i defending his character but from my experience with the guy (he is everywhere) he's probably not a child creeper.  He's just an agressive business man who sometimes is unscrupulous.  ("like how gocoin name is a rip of gogocoin") This attracts other people who live on that edge. 
As far as his personal life goes i'd guess this guy gets F****** by pedafile adults with lots of money since he's a child looking, adult.. people are weird... some people are really weird.

30% of the coins are already lost.  sooo maybe china sells... I'll buy any they don't want.  Maybe china keeps them and doesn't spend them and they never go into circulation.  The rest of them will be worth more.. Win Win Win lol

Hey miner here.  Don't buy a mining contract.. you've been told enough.  With the amount of money you have my advice is to buy btc if you don't want to go through buying it on coinbase or mtgox buying on ebay works great.  Use some of the btc to buy things like galaxycoin litecoin let your money flip then put it back into btc.  Do not buy a mining contract do not buy a miner unless you're planning on spending over 12k.

Personally lost 10k+ it did feel a bit soul sucking.  I know a few people who have went from 200k to 50k
I'm sure the people that have gone from 10million to much less are bumbed but if they have that many coins they should know the market enough to know we're all gravy by next year.  
Good idea posting this.
