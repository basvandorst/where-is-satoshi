You need to open your ears to listen.

Exactly...its like programming 101 to understand this concept.  OP is a total noob.

Read my post below.  FUD stands for fear, uncertainty and doubt.  It was posted here to achieve that result.  That is all that means.

All the environmental tards don't understand that energy usage is not equal to energy source (which most of them have issues with--"carbon footprint", etc).  They are going to try to politicize it more and more.

If you want to learn about the Lightning Network and not just read random FUD, check out this informative talk with Andreas A. and Elizabeth S.:

LOL do you even computer?  I'm not going to argue with someone as ignorant as you, it's insane and a waste of time.

It would be nice to be able to search both the mainnet and testnet with an option if possible.
@_date: 2018-02-21 06:28:31
Yeah sure.  I bought a BTC sweater that's worth quite a lot now.

I would like to follow them as well...never hurts to have more opinions.

Right.  So "FUD" means fear, uncertainty, and doubt--not liar.  It's obvious that this was posted by a Bcasher to make people fearful and worry about the future of LN (you can even check his history).  But anyway, I have tried out the test network as well and I would have to try really hard to be so pessimistic about its future.  I don't think the initial setup for running a test network node was that painful, but I only tried one implementation, not all 3!  If you listen to the talk I posted it is not FUD but realistically optimistic, which I would prefer.  It also talks about the expansion of LN and how it may offer other advantages that the average BTC'er has not thought about.  It's great to examine tech from all perspectives but there is no point in being blatantly pessimistic versus a developing technology...it doesn't do anyone any good.  I am not trying to be a dick, just sayin' :)
