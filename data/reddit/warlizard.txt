That's like saying a car owned by Hertz Rental was found containing drugs. So what? Are you saying that JP Morgan is running drugs? 
Why is this even here?
@_date: 2019-07-09 23:18:03
@_date: 2019-07-09 23:59:57
That's Reddit for you.
I swear, I could make an anti Trump account that pretended to be super reasonable but held the party line and I'd equal my current account Karma in 6 months.
People don't care about accuracy. They care about having their views reinforced in an inflammatory post.
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:03:25
Yeah, back in 2013 they called me one of the redditors who rule the internet so you know they're full of shit.
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:24:17
@_date: 2015-05-08 00:58:48
Motherfuckers should hire me to be the CEO.
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:14:13
That's why you could opt in or out of different types of groups, or have it by username.
@_date: 2015-01-30 17:54:30
The goal isn't to monetize, it's to add functionality that's useful to the community, based on purchasing power.
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:35:36
I'm just throwing out a bunch of stupid ideas, but how long do you think it would take to get a bunch of really sharp devs on board who split the profits? Maybe Reddit, Inc., takes 50% and the rest is broken up amongst the participants.
So many cool things could be done.
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:28:43
I know what you're saying, but they're constantly trying to sell things to us - it's just not stuff we want.
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:34:56
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:20:36
It would be good for the site.
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:28:04
Because it's lame.
@_date: 2015-01-30 14:38:48
True. But hating him seems a bit much.
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:15:48
It's not as much a question of monetizing Reddit as it is funding ways to make the site better.
@_date: 2015-01-30 08:14:06
Damn my memory. I know it was right when people started talking about it.
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:55:05
Someone has to lead though. Needs a PM. And someone has to have the overall idea of what the game will be.
@_date: 2015-01-30 00:01:00
Goddamit. Can't a brother be serious for ONCE?
@_date: 2015-01-30 08:14:44
Nah. Right now, we have interested subscribers with no association to each other.
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:18:08
Agreed. By the way, this entire discussion is easily the most rational and reasoned of any I've had on Reddit for many years.
I think part of the reason is that quips and jokes don't lend themselves to real conversation, but even more than that, when I do post something, I try to craft it in such a way that I'm not just providing facts and sources but also telling a story and maybe there aren't too many ways to respond.
Regardless, this is interesting as hell and thanks for talking with me about it.
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:09:25
Interesting. Probably too server intensive though.
@_date: 2015-01-30 04:22:40
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:37:42
@_date: 2015-01-30 00:49:32
I hear you but I think it could be done in a safe enough fashion to warrant the testing.
Also, the thing that killed Digg was that it was being gamed, not that they tried new things.
Once the base credibility of the site was gone, that was it. As long as Reddit protects that, I think they could do many different types of things.
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:35:31
I'm going to just pretend it didn't.
@_date: 2015-01-30 16:40:12
Yeah, there are certainly complexities in implementation, and I truly believe that improving the usability of the site is paramount, but that has to be funded and the goofy side-projects they're running don't seem to do either.
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:19:57
Or 1 app. Or 1 whatever. The point is that there are brilliant people on here and in many cases they're fucking off, doing something that they hate.
@_date: 2015-01-30 00:53:44
Instead of viewing it as monetizing the site, think of it as providing better services to the users of the site.
Currently, yeah, it's chaos, but tons of great content gets overlooked because people don't even know how to find it.
We should be leveraging our buying power to get the things WE want.
@_date: 2015-01-29 23:16:44
Ever feel like Reddit leadership has no real direction or sense of what to do with the site?
It seems like there are so many obvious tie-ins, like an app that you can use that marks nearby Redditors, a dating app (Red-date), a "Reddit-Approved" restaurant list (Red-Ate) where you get discounts, more personalization, tags for posts to make finding and hiding things simpler.
Shit, for that matter an Angry Snoo knock-off game, licensed out would bring in money.
They could make buying concert tickets cheaper, buying textbooks cheaper, and a fucking thousand other things to leverage the massive buying power of the Reddit community.
Would you pay $5 a month to be able to save 40% on concert tickets? 
What about a Reddit record label, or a Reddit game dev studio, where games are crowdsourced and people can sign up to work on them?
Fucking hell, they spend so much time allowing you to customize an avatar that doesn't even appear next to your name instead of improving the search functions so you can find shit or giving customization over what content you see.
I don't get it, really, I don't. It's almost like they exist in a bubble and have no idea how to use the immense resources available.
Think about what it would be like if Reddit housed a bitcoin bank and instead of the kludgy method of tipping you could just, oh, I don't know, DIRECTLY tip someone and it would go into their account.
Wouldn't you love to see which comments were tipped the highest? Or maybe the most? What if you could filter reddit by comments the community were willing to PAY to see?
Shit, wouldn't that be a way to really understand where the buying power of Reddit was? Instead of views, which are largely useless, you would have access to a demographic of users who are interested and solvent, but also willing to buy.
I swear, by just giving people the chance to buy something, they'd buy it, but selling t-shirts and fucking plush animals is like using a race car to deliver mail.
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:03:59
Fair enough, but think of it this way: Reddit is comprised of the most desirable demographic in existence and somehow the best they can do is offer stuffed animals.
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:29:21
Organizing a fund raiser is cool, but that's still not a community.
@_date: 2015-01-30 06:27:49
Nah, just some social integration. The issue is that redditors don't actually interact unless there's a specific comment they're replying to. 
No community.
@_date: 2015-01-30 05:44:13
I'm the guy. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:20:20
Subs don't bind people together. They just provide a common place to read the same things.
Look, if I disappear tomorrow, who gives a fuck? Realistically, there will be a few people who will care, but 99.999% of everyone who even *recognizes* my username couldn't give two shits.
Maybe a few months down the line, someone will think, "shit, I haven't seen that Gaming Forum guy around" and then move on.
But if I had a friend's list, or some sort of community, then someone would look at it and say, "Damn, where the fuck has War been? He hasn't logged into Reddit in 12 days. I wonder if everything is ok?"
That's a community, not just having a place to post.
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:05:04
To what end? Why tip yourself? I guess if you wanted to promote yourself you could do it, but there has to be a way around this issue.
@_date: 2015-01-30 06:15:49
It's crazy, but maybe crazy enough to work!
@_date: 2015-01-30 05:29:05
You're saying you wouldn't go?
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:09:47
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:13:14
@_date: 2015-01-30 05:26:18
So link up the discussion?
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:51:31
@_date: 2015-01-30 00:29:49
@_date: 2015-01-30 17:17:57
Possibly, but Reddit gets weird when you ask for attention. The opposite tends to occur.
@_date: 2015-01-30 04:21:24
@_date: 2015-01-29 23:44:26
It's just nuts. Reddit isn't a community because there's nothing that ties us together.
I have pretty high name recognition on Reddit, but Unidan was much better known and in ONE day he went from benevolent and beloved scientist to pariah who STILL receives death threats.
You're all alone here and IMO that's the problem. I have about a week's less than 6 years of Reddit gold. So what? What do I get for that? Can't I just use [Reddit Enhancement Suite]( and Adblock to accomplish the same thing?
No one minds being sold something when it's something they want, whether recognition, access, or tangible goods.
It's when utterly useless features are added that don't enhance the experience, when over and over again we get told that Reddit servers are overloaded, when many AMAs are done in less than an hour and we leave feeling empty and used, that it really hits me how much of a lost juggernaut we're riding.
There's no way to make friends here unless you directly interact with someone and happen to see something they post. Shit, I'd love to know who lives in Scottsdale and enjoys the same things I do.
Do you think there's some way that Reddit's database could be mined to make that useful to me? 
"Hey Warlizard, we noticed there are 26 people in your area who like off-roading, guns, are former military, play video games, and scuba. Would you like to be added to a list of them?"
"Hey Warlizard, there's a meetup in your area and we think you'd get along with the people who are attending. Here's a calendar of events not dependent on a specific subreddit for you to attend."
"Hey Warlizard, we see that you like Rush. They're coming to town, would you like us to add you to the pool of people who'd like to go? The more people who sign up, the better the deal we get on tickets."
It drives me nuts that basic site functions are broken but the leadership team insists on lumbering along ignoring actual user requests and deploying things no one wants.
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:50:59
Gold and upvotes are similar, but I see some major differences.
1. Upvotes are free. They mean nothing other than the post is accessible.
2. Gold is shit. It has almost no value and can't be regifted, so the barrier to gilding something is high. Many people can't gild because they don't have paypal, etc. But if your account accrued Bitcoin from people giving it to you, you could give it to others without having to go through the hassle of even *knowing* how it worked.
3. The value-add I see is in building the community, as I've said on so many other comments, and part of that is making Reddit more useful.
@_date: 2015-01-30 08:14:18
I hope not.
@_date: 2015-01-30 02:00:39
Some of them are shit but the point is that nothing I've seen points to the creation of a community, rather the exploitation of a group.
@_date: 2015-01-30 00:29:11
Of course not, some are stupid and would fail miserably, but the point is, they're all geared toward building a community and right now, Reddit isn't one.
Look at Google -- they try all sorts of shit and punt when it doesn't work.
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:34:10
Well, I've commented in a few other places, but fundamentally, build a community, something they have seemingly no wish to do.
If tomorrow, people get pissed off at something Reddit does, they fuck off and leave.
If you have 40 or 50 friends you see every day here, you grouse, bitch, complain, but you stick around because that's where your friends are.
I'd use their databases (fully opt in or out) to match Redditors by interest and make this more than a place to rant.
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:29:30
Some of them are stupid as hell, but that's sort of the point. Try a bunch of stupid shit and build a damned community instead of a bunch of discrete lurkers.
@_date: 2015-01-30 00:00:39
@_date: 2015-01-30 14:44:28
Not a feature I use. Honestly, I don't have time. It takes all the time I have to just reply to everyone.
@_date: 2015-01-30 05:26:54
Coming up on 6 for me. Same.
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:27:43
Maybe it wouldn't work but right now, upvoting costs nothing. Anyone can do it, so you don't know what's worth a shit and what isn't.
The closest thing they have now is gilded comments.
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:18:47
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:28:33
Mission accomplished.
@_date: 2015-01-30 04:23:59
Maybe, but those are subs that collect people to play together elsewhere.
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:14:38
I completely agree. The lack of a social aspect is what keeps Reddit from being influential. Now it's just a market.
@_date: 2015-01-30 02:03:07
Lolz. Not likely.
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:27:54
Which is limitless.
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:02:51
I was just ranting and shitting ideas and while I'd love for all of them to be brilliant, I think they're the starting point. The fundamental issue is that there's no real community and therefore the site is subject to dispersion at the slightest problem.
Think about how many people stayed on World of Warcraft for YEARS because that's where their friends were. Why doesn't Reddit have a "Friends List"?
I mean, come ON. I don't want to have to go to a screen to scroll down a list of posts in the hopes that one of my friends said something interesting. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:39:14
Yeah, Klinebl00 has been after me to join for years.
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:21:04
Yeah... Good times.
@_date: 2015-01-30 16:41:01
Interesting and pretty much what I had in mind.
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:36:36
People hate being sold *what they don't want*. People will pay 5 bucks for a cup of flavored water when it's presented right.
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:15:26
@_date: 2015-01-29 23:57:14
Thanks, that's nice of you to say, but they all seem like very obvious opportunities and I'm sure there are much brighter people who've proposed similar.
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:20:56
Heh, true.
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:11:16
Yep. Provide services that are useful and people will pay. Shove shit down their throats and they revolt.
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:20:32
No bots. You know that.
@_date: 2015-01-30 04:22:35
And I do it manually. NO BOTS.
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:14:27
I'm not that guy.
@_date: 2015-01-30 06:14:37
So simple.
@_date: 2015-01-30 02:02:10
Well, then they should hire me. I have vision. Well, maybe "visions". The doctors aren't sure.
Not that they would pay me what I'd require to move there anyway.
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:18:15
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:17:38
True, and might improve the interaction between people. Kindler, gentler Reddit... lol
@_date: 2015-01-30 06:14:30
Just saying.
@_date: 2015-01-30 00:28:16
I don't have 500 million bucks.
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:45:32
Lol. Well, you're welcome to say hi on Snapchat, when you'd find out I'm a white, middle-aged guy with blond hair who likes to rant on Reddit.
@_date: 2015-01-30 06:14:45
I'm not in Austin.
@_date: 2015-01-30 08:12:41
@_date: 2015-01-30 05:27:32
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:10:49
You wouldn't believe how many people have PM'd me with the status on projects that fill every single thing I mentioned in my rant.
@_date: 2015-01-30 14:44:53
Thanks, that's really nice of you to say.
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:05:26
@_date: 2015-01-30 08:12:34
Yeah, we're missing tons of good content.
@_date: 2015-01-30 14:53:25
Well, the most you see someone gilded is usually about 2 or 3. Sure, high ones exist, but on a normal basis, there aren't that many people who do it.
Next, you can't re-gift gold. If they were tipped in Bitcoin, they could take a small percentage and re-gift. That takes the barrier to entry of a tip down and makes it more accessible.
@_date: 2015-01-30 17:48:35
Well, the fact that they're small is the issue. As soon as one grows, it turns to shit unless the mod team is so on their game that they prevent it. comes to mind.
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:18:04
Many places spend years in the red until they build them up.
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:15:01
Meh. It's just Reddit. Make the face, move on.
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:16:14
Actually, yeah. But focus on building the community, which none of those things does.
@_date: 2015-01-30 05:25:46
Which is why they need to build a community so it doesn't pop like a bubble when they piss people off.
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:54:12
@_date: 2015-01-30 05:29:14
@_date: 2015-01-30 16:41:17
sweet :)
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:21:46
Well, I was thinking more of one like Steam or Battle.net, where I could find people I know and like.
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:16:30
Not really. It's an aggregated SIG.
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:31:36
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:27:18
The result has been myriad subreddits where the loudest voices rule and dissent is stifled.
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:25:49
ಠ‿ಠ / &amp;
@_date: 2015-01-30 00:37:01
No offense taken at all.
The Angry Birds thing was me ranting about stupid they could be in relation to what they're doing now, but as far as the mostly anonymous platform, my point is that this ISN'T an online community.
It's simply a group of relatively anonymous people who happen to read the same things and occasionally comment.
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:31:10
27th of July, if all goes well.
@_date: 2015-01-30 00:42:32
Hence beta testing. Set up a skunkworks with oddball projects and let Redditors beta test them. See what works and what doesn't.
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:18:41
Or try a few and see what works.
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:16:35
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:23:20
The fragmented nature of the site leads to people taking the path of least resistance and sticking to the defaults, unfortunately.
Honestly, I think there are so many ways to do fun things with the site that it drives me crazy sometimes.
@_date: 2015-01-30 05:39:17
Well, maybe it's a terrible idea, but it's an IDEA. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:13:02
Good at?
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:13:50
Ok, I said I wasn't going to tell this publicly but oh well.
Years ago, back in 2008 I think, when it first came out (I told one person 2006 but I looked it up and that's not possible) I set up a bitcoin mining computer in one of my stores. It just sat there running, doing its thing for a month or so and then I needed the computer for something and reformatted it. Don't know how much it mined or what I lost, but I still look back in irritation at that.
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:07:49
Heh, nah, I just smoothed out a couple stories and put in some updates about the war.
@_date: 2015-02-08 20:34:53
I'm really glad.
I'm about to upload the newly edited and updated version too. It's smoother and Han doesn't shoot first.
