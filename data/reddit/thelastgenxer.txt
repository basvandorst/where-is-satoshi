I don’t have the numbers but it feels like 50% goes to good use. The rest goes to bureaucracy, and things we should never be paying for!

Neither the car in the picture or nearly all Lambos have the approach angle to handle that drive way. 
Might need a Crossover or better.

That’s earning money. Not creating currency.

Dude.  According to XE currency, 10,000,000,000 Zimbabwe dollars is 
27.6 million usd
@_date: 2019-03-21 03:09:15
Especially since that’s not an actual bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-10-22 02:10:18
Seriously. What does this do that I can’t do from my smartphone? 
Is it just about buying cash?

Let’s pretend I brought this asteroid home. 
Wouldn’t the value of gold just plummet? 
It wouldn’t be zero because it’s so useful in electronics and as tooth fillings, but it would be my luck to loose money on just having this land in my yard (and magically without destruction).

The eli5 explanation makes it seem like the system will no longer work once all the bitcoins have been mined.   
@_date: 2018-10-22 16:45:20
1 doge has always equaled 1 doge.  
@_date: 2018-10-21 18:56:14
I don’t understand the value of a BTC vending machine. 
Especially one on every corner. 
(I’m not fud, but I don’t even use ATMs). 
So what is the scenario of using a btc machine? 
I’m at the gas station and I realize I need btc for the club tonight? 
@_date: 2019-03-21 04:35:59
Does this mean your money only has “collector” value? 
@_date: 2018-10-21 00:29:35
No. Only doge= itself.  
@_date: 2018-10-21 20:13:07
Yes. I’m not poo pooing anything. I just don’t see why I personally would ever need this service and am curious why others do. 
I buy/sell btc, but I do that from my computer or smart phone. Just like my internet shopping.   
@_date: 2018-10-22 16:42:03
Lol. I’ve never used a regular atm.  
I understand their purpose, but I fail to grasp the need being so great that an atm is on every commercial corner.  
@_date: 2019-10-19 02:40:25
I doubt the cat did that on its own.  
Maybe a dogecoin, but not this.
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:20:10
I chose to pay bills this winter instead.  
Big mistake.
@_date: 2019-06-08 03:11:38
Its like nasa. We already went to the moon. 
Then the space program died. 
But right now we’re at the space shuttle and the future looks bright! 
But then it’ll never get replaced, people will learn its limited to low earth orbit, and they’ll become old.  
But then we’ll talk about mars!! And going back to noon! 
And cancel that too. 
But Elon and his falcon 9 shows up to give us hope

This is why they have that extra mattress. It’s there to protect from the deadly sides of the tramp. And I’m not sure if they implemented it due to his height or due to him becoming slightly off center.

Can we get a theologian and astrophysisicist in here? 
If you become immortal, does the soul have any benefit outside of r&amp;b? 
And if immortal,,, what happens long term if humans never manage to become space inhabiting beings?

Unless I under appreciate the fax machine. 
The internet seemed to have had a bigger impact by 1998 than the fax machine ever did.

So let’s do it like they do on the discovery channel
@_date: 2019-04-19 21:30:47
This makes it appear they are the same person.
@_date: 2019-04-27 03:05:39
Everytime btc goes up $500 I mean to sell, and then rebuy when it drops $500....
But I keep doing the opposite:(
@_date: 2019-04-27 23:48:12
That’s the real trick isn’t it.
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:31:03
We already did moon. 
We are currently nasa between Apollo and shuttle. 
Or nasa now.  
@_date: 2018-11-22 17:56:49
I clearly mentioned what the something was, as well as my shitty memory could allow. And they stopped the whole idea after challenger.  
You condescending redditer.  
It was either a tank or a rocket booster. I’m sorry my memory is shit.  
Details are fuzzy as I cannot find it but it seemed to connect to the fuel system inside the shuttle bay.  
2 of the shuttles had this connection.  
Ps I found it. 
Challenger and discovery were designed with the shuttle centaur project in mind. 
It would carry a centaur rocket in the cargo bay. 
And that would then fire from the cargo bay to launch whathaveyou.  
@_date: 2018-11-18 02:37:01
Well shit.  
I might want to rethinking my hodling strategy. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 20:54:36
I’m only bothered by the fact that the shuttle was limited to low earth orbit.  
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:54:49
I too was that way till “things” happened. 
Someday I will be again. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 12:43:40
Yeah if not for the French, we’d all be speaking English today!

100% chance. 
In about 65 billion years the sun will encompass the earth, I’m sure it’ll be a useless asset after that.

Nah, Black Friday sale. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 02:34:47
I could not find anything on this on a quick phone search. 
But two shuttles were built with “something” that can go into the cargo bay.  
When I read about years ago, it was unclear to me if it was an extra tank of fuel, or a separate rocket that could launch things even higher. 
I thought challenger was one of them, and they canceled the idea of exploring shortly after that tradgedity (despite being unrelated). 
I forgot the other shuttle.  
But yeah I could not find anything when limited to
Mobile.

I literally cannot understand the purpose of these.,,,,
Except for international travel. 
Absolutely perfect for international travel.  
You can withdraw cash. 
And then buy coin when you leave.  
But otherwise it’s a mystery to me.
@_date: 2019-05-19 01:53:43
Glad you mentioned it!

So mad I was stupid broke all winter. Still stupid broke. 
But really wanted to buy more btc.
@_date: 2018-12-02 04:46:20
No. The previous guys explanation was better and spookier.

You mean sell bitcoin without the tax man noticing?
@_date: 2019-05-09 14:37:20
I really do not understand the point of these. 
Other than if you are traveling, especially internationally, and you need local currency.  
Can someone please explain the value in these machines? 
(Last time I asked people kept saying “so you can buy bitcoin” and I’m like that is what your phone and computer are for).
@_date: 2019-05-19 01:53:18
Well that’s a reason.

Every listing I’ve seen has a different age for each generation. 
Y became millennials. 
55-1970 is the earliest end date I’ve ever seen for gen x!  Aren’t boomers at least till 60?
I’ve seen some list as late as 1983. 
Personally I like anyone who graduated highschool in the 20th century. Which would be about 1980/81. 
60-80ish
