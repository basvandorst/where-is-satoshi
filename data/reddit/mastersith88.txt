It looks like they have already had some practice double-spending too...

True but if some natural disaster happens and destroys half of the internet I have a feeling that double confirmation times would actually be much better then how it would effect the banking/credit card industry.  
Delays are rough but much better then say the entire visa system shutting down.

When I was taking flight lessons (2004ish) I paid in cash most of the time.  Cash is even more anonymous then bitcoin (can't see the origin address) and I had to provide enough info about myself that there was no real danger that I was someone else/ a terrorist/ something scary.
TLDR- Bitcoin and Cash both pose the same 'risk' when dealing with a stranger.

They could begin a 'Selfish Miner' attack anytime now, The 50%+1 attack is a worst-case scenario but a 'Selfish Miner' attack would lead to them gaining 50%+1 much quicker then normal.

It would be overwhelmingly bad for Bitcoin but their pool would benefit by having a head-start on the next block in the chain.  In essence they would earn more then their Hashing/sec should earn given an equal or 'fair' mining pool.
Earn more in the short term and jeopardize the long-term success of cryptocurrency.

Generally you don't have to worry about that because if a single miner simply doubles the difficulty he/she/it has 51% of the network and can perform a 51% attack.  Attacking the network in the way you describe is unlikely simply because it is more costly and less effective then a 51% attack.

It is typical behavior with ATH though.

For US based Bitcoiners there are not many options.  The options that do exist require verification to be manually reviewed before any funds transferred can be done.
Coinbase has an automated verification process for attaching a Bank account and much easier verification methods for PayPal &amp; Credit / Debit cards.
To put it in perspective - I was able to buy $1000 on my Coinbase account without having to wait...
I opened a Kraken account at the same time.  It took them 2 full weeks to verify Tier 1 only.

Why wait?  I'll buy your BTC @ $500.....

Then he is purposely misleading when he equates a gold mine to a bitcoin mine(r).  A bitcoin mine(r) is closer to a part of a banking mainframe.  It is there to determine if a transaction is legitimate (enough bitcoin available to transfer) and then confirm the transaction.
The reward for doing this is an occasional payout (fees + new coins).  Either he did not understand how both ends interact with the miner or he did not care and chose to omit important information to make bitcoin look bad.
