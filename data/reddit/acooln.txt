ipad air (Target Gyft card),
all my christmas shopping via amazon/target gyft cards,
Whole Foods grocery (every week via Gyft),
new GPUs for mining rig via tigerdirect,
countless papa johns pizzas (again, gyft),
FTD flowers for my gf.
I run a rig mining altcoins, that i convert and spend. Even with the low price of $500, it still covers my electricity and my groceries. While everyone may bitch about me not saving my btc for when it goes to the moon, the honest truth is, it could crash at any time. I'm of the mind I'll spend it now for stuff I can use, I already have a good job, this is a hobby that pays for itself (and other things)
I do have some in cold storage, but thats for when btc hits $10k...

After I sent her a tip, I decided to send btc to all those who donated to her so far. I keep seeing QR codes getting posted and people tipping them, which is fine, I like seeing bitcoin get the publicity, but I figure sometimes the people tipping should be rewarded as well.
If I had a lot, I would have doubled what everyone tipped her, however, I don't so I can't.

First thing you should do once you've jailbroken your phone. 
As for your question, being jailbroken doesn't really increase your risk. Use common sense, strong passwords and 2F login practices (shoud be using them anyways) and you'll be fine. I personally wouldn't keep all my btc on my phone, but I do keep a blockchain wallet for my spendable btc so I can always just shoot off some coins if I want/need to.

Paywall... Apparently I've read 5 articles from newsweek this month, anyone copy&amp;paste?

Isn't there a way to report adword scams? I thought there was an easy way to report them to google and they'd lose their account. 
I think this is it

Jailbreak &gt; Cydia &gt; Blockchain.info app is sadly the best thing we get. 
Or coinpunk.com is an html5 based wallet, although i have not used it so can not attest to how good/bad it may be. 
Or you could just access Blockchain via safari.

Glad to see an alternate solution instead of paying them off.

I wouldn't trust anyways. [He screwed me out of $85 in a gift card exchange]( he'd definitely screw you on paypal.

Yeah, I went looking for the thread yesterday and he deleted it. Didn't expect to get any coin, but a little woulda been nice to pay forward for the next MillionaireMaker drawing.

Never heard of you.


Site looks nice and simple. 


Haven't tried buying yet, may try a small purchase this weekend.

Well, my accounts on circle and coinbase work just fine, so don't think I'm a crook. However I can't get any help at all getting my password reset or my account unlocked due to 6 months inactivity. Multiple emails unanswered for 3 weeks now, no way to login and get any thing I may have left on cryptsy. Guess I'm part of the .001% who arent a crook, but having problems getting into your site.

Gyft.com sells amazon cards. Takes less than 5mins every time i do it. Go to gyft, buy card with btc, go to amazon cart, input gift code. Done.
