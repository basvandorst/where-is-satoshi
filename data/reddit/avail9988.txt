“Mining” Bitcoins takes so much processor power that it’s often done with [specialized computers]( optimized for rapid repetitive calculations. So how much power can that take?"
Dear god why did they link to Buttfly Labs..

I like this approach, thanks for doing your bit for bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-05-09 16:08:00
very interesting question, do you mean with zero electricity? because if you had a smartphone that was charged up you could use that or if you had a paper wallet you could hand it to someone else and that would technically be transferring money.

Reddit got me started on Bitcoin, I read of AMA of a guy who proclaimed him self a Bitcoin millionaire at 25 or something and I've been living in the rabbit hole ever since.
@_date: 2013-05-15 17:41:30
however Yacoin is specifically designed for CPU mining and prevents GPU/Asic, that would be the likely contender.

Well I hope you get your stuff

Yes it is a false positive (I hope) I have just added an exception to ignore it.
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:49:27
I will take two of these for Litecoins please.

"Hi, 
I would like to make a donation to Wikipedia as I love the site. I could not find an option to donate via bitcoin, are you able to accept donations via this payment method? If no is the answer unfortunately I will not be donating which would be a shame as I would love to support the site I love. I have $500 worth of bitcoin coming your way let me know if you would like it.
@_date: 2013-04-24 18:31:34
Thanks mate this is awesome!
@_date: 2013-05-06 17:02:23
was just laughing at the spelling mistake
@_date: 2013-05-15 14:18:48
I encountered this exact claim the other day from someone i know
@_date: 2013-04-19 03:25:07
sorry just though some bitcoin miners might have some spare ltc
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:29:53
I am pretty sure reddit is single-handedly driving the spread of bitcoin 
@_date: 2013-07-03 05:36:14
How about 50k worth of GPU's mining litecoin? Will be well over $250 per week. 
@_date: 2013-06-28 07:33:12
But... But he lost money he never made
@_date: 2013-05-17 18:35:33
Please make one of these for LTC i will buy it immediately, also another question is there anyway to backup the hardware wallet?

~~Maybe~~ BTC is the currency of the machines (our future overlords)
@_date: 2013-05-18 08:41:11
Considering you can follow the block chain of the transaction [here]( or [here]( it is a little hard to fake...

"invested their inheritance of 30 thousand in Bitcoin 3 years ago" they must be worth a fortune now
@_date: 2013-06-25 14:33:36
Not many people are mentioning that once Mt Gox spends a fortune on lawyers n fights all these battles and wins it will pave the way for more main stream adoption and make it easier for more exchanges to get backing &amp; open up. 
@_date: 2013-04-26 22:33:58
I like your version better, it is easier to read but could do with a tiny amount of prettying up

Go to  Copy the web page to a USB key Turn off your computer Unplug it from the interweb Boot your computer with a Linux Live CD Run the saved web page Use it to generate a public key and private key Print these out. DON'T LOSE THEM! Reboot your computer with internet access. Send coins to the public address. This is called cold storage. The internet has never seen the private key so your coins will be safe unless you lose your private key. Then they're gone forever.

Looks like January 11th me. Maybe you use a strange and foreign concept to record dates?
@_date: 2013-05-09 16:30:03
I would say the whole [E-Gold]( scandal is the main reason or at least a consideration. The creator faced numerous felony charges.
@_date: 2013-07-07 04:20:42
So.... What does a honey badger have to do with btc?
@_date: 2013-05-20 03:54:20
true, i guess when you read the top line as just a guess which is stated as fact you can assume all the other points are also not to be believed
@_date: 2013-05-17 19:08:24
yes that is 230k...
@_date: 2013-04-19 04:07:03
Don't forget to give Litecoin a little plug when contact western union..
@_date: 2013-04-15 07:39:26


You mine Bitcoins by finding data sets that make certain patterns when they go through the Bitcoin hash function, tricking it into allowing unfunded purchases.    
Go home Gizmodo your drunk..

@_date: 2013-04-18 17:39:07
I hope you didn't pay before delivery lol
@_date: 2013-05-07 15:45:57
So because I'm mining on a pool does that mean I do not get a share of said fees? also what happens hypothetically in a few years when it is no longer profitable to mine and people abandon mining who will process the transactions?
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:43:26
Great article good find OP, I was looking for something like this from the point of view of some economists although it is clear my guess is as good as theirs where bitcoin will be in 10 years. My real question is say bitcoin went mainstream how dramatically would that effect the price, are we likely to see btc going for 1k - 5k if not more in the future?? 
@_date: 2013-07-04 05:34:45
I think it was trying to communicate with you
@_date: 2013-04-29 00:40:25
Here is the [free]( version, think I will give this a try.
