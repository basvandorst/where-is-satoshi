and a vertical spike up of 15% on one day is what..?
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:15:04
ever think that maybe the pumps up are artificial as well? lollll
@_date: 2019-04-08 21:08:59
if you watch the order book, every time there’s a pump there’s a 100btc Buy wall that pushes the price up and keeps moving up. That’s called artificial movement..
@_date: 2019-05-10 16:56:44
you mean up 3-4-5% everyday haha
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:03:11
it’s pretty scary if you think about it cuz while the unregulation might be great for price movement, it also means the few that control the most bitcoin can control exactly the direction they want the market to go
@_date: 2019-05-10 16:50:47
It honestly feels like this is being manipulated up as high as it can go
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:10:39
if you’re a smart person and you see it continuously going up and everyone in bull mode, why would you sell at all right now? probably people selling hoping to catch a quick dip
@_date: 2019-05-10 18:25:39
yeah, I think people wouldn’t want to miss out on another 2017-like pump, so it’s starting way earlier and faster
@_date: 2019-05-10 16:56:25
this is what i mean, big buys then huge sells...this is just so fishy honestly
@_date: 2019-05-10 16:51:49
I mean either this is serious manipulation upwards or people are just fomoing like crazy cuz it goes up 4-5% every single day..
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:01:36
I was kidding haha I’ve seen how crazy bitcoin can be. in my experience, once everyone gets in the mindset of “it never will go down” and ultra-bull mode is when you should eventually sell
@_date: 2019-05-10 16:49:54
it’s only manipulation if it goes down
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:11:24
I was kidding haha
@_date: 2019-05-10 16:54:24
it’s just such a funny market honestly..when it goes down people cry manipulation, and when it goes up no one says anything...it’s pretty obvious that there’s upwards manipulation mixed with fomo going on right now. the question is, how far up can it go cuz there’s money to be made
@_date: 2019-05-10 16:49:37
btc is insane it doesn’t go down..you could buy any type of retrace and it’s automatic you will make money
