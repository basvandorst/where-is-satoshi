I think we are actually on the same page for the most part :)
With Bitcoin being different I meant, there's no benefit to using/buying it. Unless you look far ahead and are convinced it's value will rise. With the internet you can get something immediate out of it, information, answers, connectivity, time savings, etc. And with torrents, it's all kinds of media. And all of this required no investment, but some of your time.
Bitcoin provides a lot of things people actually need, but I think they don't realize it yet, and probably won't with its bad public image, unless their faith in the normal ways of doing things is shattered by some event.
Alternatively, a steady, long term uptrend(as opposed to the current down trend) could also by a great incentive. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 09:37:57
Interesting, thanks!
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:00:19


This I agree with. With the internet or torrents in particular the incentive was to get immediate value out of it, if you can just figure it out. 
With Bitcoin it is different. You can get value out of it, but it's not immediate(if ever) and it requires you to invest more than your time.

I don't have any statistics but I'm betting the majority of transactions from localbitcoins is not through in-person meetings, but rather through the website and its escrow system. As such it is heavily centralized.
Even if it serves just as a whiteboard and the exchange happens outside, than this whiteboard is still centralized, and since it is essential to the service, the whole service is centralized. 
If there's a single point of failure(the website), than it is centralized.

Don't worry about it, just keep tipping other people then. The more you tip, the more people will notice and wonder about what this is, and so the more exposure btc gets. If people don't collect the tips, it only makes it cheaper for you to continue tipping :)

What payment method? SEPA? You can reverse that for 10 days or so, get in touch with your bank, Also, what country did you send the money to? Spain had a national holiday on the 15th, other countries perhaps too. I have a trade in limbo for that reason.
If the coins are not released on Monday, get in touch with localbitcoins support and be prepared to proof that you did pay. I think they can release the coins and they will side with you. 
If nothing helps, contact your bank and reverse the payment.

I think it's an attempt to convince people, that it's a great technology, while trying to avoid heat for "advertising" bitcoin which has a PR problem according to some.

Can we stop this World Wide Ledger nonsense? The www wasn't successful because of its name. And what does that even mean, a web? It's certainly not a web from the user point of view. It's meaningless to the common user and I bet many still don't know what www actually stands for. And if they do know it, they have no idea why. They just repeat what they've picked up. Also, the ledger term is definitely not something, that is universally understood, so it's not like  it makes anything easier.
The www was a success because of it's function and usability.  The same will be true for Bitcoin and the blockchain. There's no need for a new name and the lack of new, supposedly better name is certainly not holding Bitcoin back.

Yeah, so if XT and Mike Hearn turn out to be bad, than we can just choose another fork again. This is the beauty of open source.
If XT and Hearn were bad, than discussing them wouldn't have to be censored in r/bitcoin. People would know and stay away.
The fact that it is censored tells me there's a dictatorship happening RIGHT NOW though and it's favoring 1MB blocks, which incidentally massively limits Bitcoins growth and future potential in such a way, that everyday person-to-persona transactions would be forced off chain to centralized systems(like the one Blockstream is working on) This is exactly the opposite of what Bitcoin set out to do.
1MB blocks will lead to centralization and censorship, not the other way around.

Finally something that doesn't look like it's been designed in kindergarden.
Trezor was applauded for opensourcing their software. But now people are complaining if other people take advantage of that? For all we know they might even contribute and improve it.
Trezor has innovated in software terms, but they certainly didn't innovate in design or UX. In fact, they didn't even follow recent developments in those areas. It literally looks like something from 2 decades ago.
Now others do modernize the design and UX. This is how an ecosystem of choices develops. Well done Keepkey developers!

No, the concept of belief is irrelevant to an atheist, it's meaningless. It's subjective wishful thinking, that has no effect on reality. It's especially meaningless in the case of believing in the non-existence of something. Saying atheists believe there is no god, is an highly absurd statement. It will also be vastly misunderstood by theists, because of their understanding of belief. 
The word just doesn't describe the atheist stance very well and doesn't represent how atheists formed their opinion on the matter and so should be avoided. Atheists form their opinion based on evidence. 
Theists will often say "prove god doesn't exist!", but you can't do that. You can't prove the non-existence of something  and the burden of proof is on those who claim the existence.
 So, Atheists have no reason to think there is a god, because no evidence has been brought forward to prove it's existence. It has nothing to do with belief.
 Furthermore, atheists are not even a group of people, in the sense that people who don't collect stamps are not a group of people either. We don't describe things by the unlimited traits they don't possess. The term Atheist is only useful to discern somebody from a theists, but it doesn't really describe him in a meaningful way, just as describing somebody as a non-stamp collector is not meaningful. 
@_date: 2015-03-28 21:42:26
I'm almost certain there's a group of people pushing an anti-localbitcoins agenda in this subreddit. Maybe I'm just paranoid though. They have 2 arguments they keep bringing up. 
1. localbitcoins is bad because it only facilitates local, in-person trades. Often coupled with "I don't want to meet some shady person". - This is just false and shows the person has never actually looked at localbitcoins. Online transactions protected by escrow work flawlessly.
2. localbitcoins is bad because the margins are so high! - Unfortunate, but in my book worth it. You don't need ID on localbitcoins, and you can do fully anonymous trades when you meet in person. Also, prices are determined by each seller. With a bit of luck you can find one that sells for or very close to market price. Also, who cares about 5-10 USD with the volatility we have in Bitcoin? You gain or loose as much everyday. 
Localbitcoins is the most non-invasive way to purchase BTC.

You are too nice man, this won't get you anywhere. Don't keep BTC for each of them and wait till they are worth considerably more. Instead, gift them to them, sooner than later. Keep a backup copy of the keys for yourself.

What? In the banking system there's zero privacy. All your transactions are visible to the banks and potentially the state(if they wish). Furthermore and more importantly  all your transactions are tied to your persona, to your address etc. There's an incredible amount of highly sensitive data one can collect about you by watching where your money comes from and where it goes.
With Bitcoin on the other hand, while transactions are public, they can't necessarily be tied to an identity. Furthermore, through mixing services and usage of innumerably new addresses you have options to further increase your privacy. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 14:40:56

Yes, fair enough, I see your point for sure. You think the banking systems provide more privacy, because transactions are not public, but you have to admit that you are putting an incredible amount of trust in this centralized system. 
What is stopping banks to do whatever they want with your data and your money, when their only interest is really to monetize you. It's not like they are guided by principles or good behavior. They are a business, and you are a resource to them. They exploit you.
Also, you say that with fiat you can get the same type of anonymity as with Bitcoin. This is very true indeed, but then again, fiat lacks all the things that make Bitcoin great: The effortless, fast transfer of value over great distances without a trusted third party. 
That's why some people call Bitcoin, the currency, cash of the internet.
Privacy might not be the golden side of Bitcoin, but at least it gives you the user options, especially with upcoming developments and improvements. It shifts control and ownership back to the user. With that also comes responsibility, which I think you agree, might not be everyone's cup of tea. 
Anyway, great exchange, have a nice day :)
