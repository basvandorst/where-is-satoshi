3 days ago my wallet was empty for hours...
then cryptic signs appeared ...
meanwhile I got 0,001 from an auction at ebay, I logged into the blockchain-wallet, saw the fresh transaction and gave positive feedback to the seller.
When I log into it  NOW, it looks as if NOTHING HAPPENED, and I don't know what to do.  CRYPTOMADNESSINTESIFIES!
It's my first payment for BTC.

I run through the city with my flyers,
have good experiences in front of western union and moneygram, now I design a special flyer I can stick in front of their stores. The usual shops are tired and ~~fat~~ fed up with too much info nowadays, everyone wants to sell stuff. I got a concrete question about 100k in btc from 2 dudes here but can't do it for them so I am gonna:
Set up btc-coffee-party in an african restaurant, and a weekly meet-up at another bar, all central.
I hope I get sum people, it was a hard way and I still learn to STFU when someone. doesn't get the concept- I know it's my fault then haha.

Regulations only exist because Power corrupts, it is the nature of centralized systems, because the profits are bigger than the fines.
25 Trillion dollar disappeared and nothing changed, it's getting worse.
This technology works out PERFECTLY like it's supposed to do.
Centralized solutions for ''decentralized problems'' ?
Greets to Andreas, Thnx ;D
