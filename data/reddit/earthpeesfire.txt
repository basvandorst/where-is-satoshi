I had every intention of getting to bed early.  Nope!  This train wreck is too fun to watch.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:34:29
I had a teeny fraction of a coin totaling a whopping 32 cents. Shew.  
I'm nauseous for those who lost a lot.  It's awful.

Gorgeous place.

He did, twice, but I had to read it thrice to figure that out.

I know that, if/when the bubble bursts, I, and many friends and family, will be buying more.  I think those of us who understand and believe in the currency, will not lose confidence and interest in it as easily as Beales posits.

My friends keep asking me this and I just tell them that I don't know.  It could be at $0 in a year OR it could be the currency of the future.  Either way, I don't want to steer anyone wrong so I usually suggest they sell stuff for Bitcoin instead of buying it outright.  I'm mining and about to sell something for Bitcoin, but I'm cashing out enough to cover my expenses.  Oh, and I've bought things from friends in Bitcoin to get them "started".  That's a win-win: they get a kick out of watching the value rise and I have someone to talk Bitcoin with.

It could probably be applied to those who want to covert your USD to Bitcoin for you.  Here's a thread regarding the, now defunct, Bitcoin USA  According to him, FinCen ruled that Bitcoin is a "Stored Value".  I guess it depends on how the definition of Money Transmitter is interpretted.  
@_date: 2011-05-24 12:18:20
 I worry Bitcoin could suffer a similar fate. 
@_date: 2011-05-24 00:45:17
Bitcoin is legal.  FinCen views it as a stored value currency. 
@_date: 2011-06-04 18:24:50
Generally, I agree with you.  I don't spend my gold to buy things for the same reason.  My point was, for those who got in REALLY early, and have lots, it's probably easier to spend.  I've only spent Bitcoins buying things from friends and family members who just want in.  No regrets (ask me again when they're worth $100 USD and the answer may have changed, though:).

They aren't regulating Bitcoin.  They're regulating the exchange of USD to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-05-03 00:59:46
I have been.  All my friends are stay-at-home moms and, although they're all pretty nerdy, they aren't computer nerds, so I imagine I can hear a whooshing sound each time I explain it.

*shivers* I'm changing my passwords today.  Sorry, Kritikal.  
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:09:15
Didn't get a call, but had to verify my account and change my password.

You think the demand spiked because of the drug and porn markets, huh?  I like that theory and would add the gambling market.  
@_date: 2011-06-06 22:07:43
Shit, a skatamooon!  
@_date: 2011-06-04 12:30:44
Ditto. And if/when the bubble pops, I'm buying more, and I won't be alone, and the exchange rate will head back up.

If I have an option to buy a product that's offered in USD and Bitcoin for $17 and 1 respectively, I'm using Bitcoin because I bought that Bitcoin for $1.30 USD.

I don't actually *want* a crash, myself.  I just really thought there'd be one. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 13:16:18
Wal-mart sells Butcoin gift cards?  That sounds like bullshit to me. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:45:18
$1k is a meaningful number.  I sold a bunch at $250 for the same reason.  I was honestly expecting a big dip *because* of past crashes, not in spite of them.  
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:59:01
I'm waiting for it to crash, but it's still going up.  WTH?  I was so certain that lots of early adopters would have a sell order in at $1000.  
@_date: 2013-03-28 12:02:28
Right?  It would drive me crazy if I added up all the things I bought with BC at today's rate...so I don't. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:01:49
Mine, too, although the only debt I have is my home loan. When/if we can pay it off by selling *half* of our Bitcoin, we'll do it. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:22:38
Yup.  It chewed right through the sell orders.  Crazy. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 00:44:33
I predict that it will get banned pretty quickly.  
@_date: 2013-03-23 22:11:55
Lol, close enough.  
@_date: 2013-04-05 11:28:44
Very cool. 
@_date: 2013-05-12 13:45:44
I suggest you get a second job, ASAP, and pay it all back.  Stealing y'all's savings is fucked up and right now, you should be combing the classifieds.  Go stand at a convenience store and offer to do manual labor cash, get a paper route, serve food, whatever, but if you don't right this quickly, your marriage is kaput. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:21:54
This is how I felt until I woke up to $260 this morning. Now I'm waffling. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:46:23
Maybe it's because $1k has been the number I thought I'd cash out at.  I sold some at $250 because it seemed unreasonably high, and I was right and it crashed soon after.  But I guess I did underestimate the China effect.  
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:38:04
Haha!  I remember telling my husband to sell enough to pay for the mining rig when they hit $4. So. Glad. He. Ignored. Me.
