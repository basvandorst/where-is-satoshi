Until we have official word everything is speculation and you should believe neither.

That might usually be the case but Gox is trying to fix this quickly. Their history also proves little communication is the norm and frankly I don't mind as I presume they're instead working diligently to solve this.

You are a great example of why the bitcoin community stopped attracting people.

The app is called "bitcoin" and can be easily found by adding a new 'other' payment through the default wallet app. For me the app has an orange colored tile with the bit coin B in white.

Been using a Lumia 920 since release. Only thing I want is VPN which is coming in a month or two with the 'blue' Windows Phone update.
They're solid, reliable phones which are easy to use +1

New currency, new forms of begging. If you provide something a little more substantial than "Do me!" I'm betting you'll have a greater chance of success.

A currency or good is worth whatever you can trade for it.
I can buy a bottle of Pepsi for $3.50AUD. The same bottle of Pepsi is worth whatever the seller accepts for it, whether that be some bitcoin or a hunk of silver. People will always need to trade, no single person, business or country can function competitively in our current society. 
If fiat currency fails something else will takes its place, right now bitcoin is in perfect position to replace the potential failings of fiat.

Cringe all you like, the article is written for the lowest common denominator. In the long term this is probably beneficial if you want to see bitmessage succeed.
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:35:55
Same. The reminder would be quite helpful.

probably one of the silk road goods

Why don't we suggest this to Gox? It may not have been something they've considered yet...
@_date: 2013-10-23 14:47:50
On a more serious note, how are the alternatives looking?

I ran into the same problem shortly after trying, thanks for the heads up.

They're also trying to attract new people whom were fearful when bitcoin was volatile. Stability means safety in investing, you should relish the fact that while this article may be poor its actually helping you.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:16:45
If you're serious, this is stupidly delusional thinking
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:54:24
Don't do that. Bitcoin should be seen as a currency not and investment. Its far too volatile to be a sound investment.

Have you tried [9gag](

Seems like quite a few people are buying things. The goal this website set for 3 months trade started just 10 days ago, its already at ~~19%~~ 23%.

link to source?

I had friends over when this aired last night, they called me into the room to watch.
I laughed instantly and said "is this a tabloid show? this is bias and fear mongering for a story. Granted we should be skeptical, but scams like this exist and happen everyday, everywhere."

ePOS in physical stores is what desperately needs developing. When someone uneducated in bitcoin can get the same ease of use as a fiat currency with less/no transaction fees and international versatility at a physical shop front, bitcoin will be successful. Until then we're just waiting for adoption, we need more than online transaction, we need to back date this new technology to our older physical system.
