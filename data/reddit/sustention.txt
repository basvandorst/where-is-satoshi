These have nothing to do with each other.  [Cross-chain transactions]( mean that you can sell namecoin entries for BTC and vice versa with zero trust and no intermediating exchanges or counterparty risk.


That's very misleading; namecoin was the original "colored" coin protocol.  What people call colored coins is actually a backport of namecoin's original *non-fungible coin* concept to the bitcoin blockchain.  Maybe with a catchier name.


Funny you mention this, because early on the bitcoin developers actually encouraged namecoin *not* to use the Satoshi blockchain due to bloat concerns (i'd post the citation if bitcointalk had a usable search API).  Unfortunately now with SatoshiDice we've got chain bloat no matter what, so it looks like they've changed their story.

Nope, wrong, read the source code.  All miners and pools will happily build on top of blocks that include custom transaction scripts.  A few pools will decline to include those transactions in *blocks they mine themselves* or might charge a higher transaction fee, but plenty of other pools such as [Eligius]( will.
The blockchain already includes plenty of custom-script (aka "non-standard") transactions.  Go take a look!
Seriously, if you aren't aware of this fact and you're presenting yourself as a bitcoin developer, people ought to be worried about that.

Nope, wrong, there are plenty of non-"standard" (ridiculous term btw) transactions already in the chain, and more added every day.  Eligius [is one pool that mines them]( and *all* pools have always honored them.
Seriously, you don't know about this and you expect people to trust you to develop bitcoin software?  Yikes.

Mike may work for a big huge company that's able to throw its weight around, but lately he's been [getting sloppy about acknowledging his use of other peoples' ideas](  Your attempt to write namecoin out of the history books is very much in line with that.

Total revisionism.  At least one of the "big names" associated with coloredcoin initially told the namecoin people **not** to use the bitcoin blockchain because they claimed it would cause bloat.
Also untrue since you can already do [cross-chain transactions]( both to and from the existing bitcoin blockchain (the other chain needs to have the same capability, of course).

No.  Simply no.  How many more times does the [link]( need to be posted before you read it?  The bitcoin network already supports everything required for cross-chain trades.
Seriously, do us all a favor and actually read about cross-chain trades before your next reply.
And please use some reasonable approximation of proper grammar.  Thanks.


I am at a loss to explain why you would expect that, except perhaps that:


Ah, you're hallucinating.  Okay, I understand now.
