I think global Bitcoin adoption would eventually kill fiat.  
Why would I want to use multiple currencies when I can do everything I need to do with just one?  And why would I want to use a regional fiat when by keeping my wealth in Bitcoin I can spend it anywhere in the world without an exchange fee?
I'm sure currency traders would love to have multiple currencies remain in play, governments want their own for economic control... but the average joe isn't going to see much value in regional fiat at that point.

I calculated earlier today that the maximum reasonable value of 1 BTC *assuming it's the only currency in the world* would be about 2.8 million in 2014 US dollars.
I currently have control of 0.12 BTC.  So in a fantasy future where Bitcoin becomes the universal method of value tracking, I might have a little over 300k.  Sure, that's an impressive ROI, but I won't be retiring any time soon.

There are a lot of people here emotionally wed to bitcoin for reasons beyond long term investment.  You have cryptoanarchists who want to overthrow governments, true believers who simply think bitcoin is a better way to do things, geeks who are having fun exploring and playing with a new technology, and short term investors who are possibly in denial over potential losses if the price doesn't rebound in a reasonable time frame.

There's a good AMA going on in about that right now.
I found the analysis of Dogecoin's near future fascinating - that high early rewards to encourage mining and adoption result in collapse when the rewards run out sometime in the next year or so.
While I don't believe the 'shibes' will drop their coin easily, it's not difficult to believe the dogecoin blockchain could collapse because nobody bothers mining it anymore.

I'm kind of concerned (I'm invested in Bitcoin for less than $100...) that CoinGateway is the beginning of the end.  It allows transparent use of altcoins as if they were bitcoin, thus destroying the scarcity aspect of bitcoin.  
For now it still leaves bitcoin as the middleman in an altcoin-&gt;bitcoin-&gt;fiat merchant transaction, so bitcoin remains more valuable... but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that this type of service could migrate from a distinct service directly to the merchant's POS system vendor and become altcoin-&gt;fiat.

Ahh.  I thought OP's scenario was that MtGox would cause a global drop in BTC.
I've no idea what the Toronto ATM is pegged to, but I wouldn't be surprised to find it's CaVirtEx plus some percentage.
For MtGox alone I can see a 100% drop if they're not moving any BTC - only an insane speculator would pay for permanently frozen Bitcoins in the hopes that one day they might be released.  Well... admittedly I might do such a thing for pennies on the dollar just in case, but it'd have to be a huge discount because I'd be assuming the coins would be forever lost to me.
@_date: 2014-04-11 14:07:33
I've only looked at Virtex, but the 'rebound' seems to have a much lower volume than the drop.
I could buy a fraction of a bitcoin for $1000 and drive the value right through the roof... until the next trade is registered.
When I see a high volume of sells at a low price followed by a much smaller volume of buys at a slightly higher price... I tend to think it's not much of a rally just yet.
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:43:46
Miners giving up and dropping out.  Maybe even large farms?
That's not good.  I wouldn't have thought the price had dropped enough that significant hashrate drop would be occurring.  You'd think the majority of the small players would keep going, a lot of the dreamers/believers/desperate gamblers, and the farms would hold on for at least a week hoping for a recovery to cover costs. (Most businesses try to keep operating past when - in retrospect - they should have closed up shop, I don't see why a BTC mining farm would be any different)
@_date: 2014-08-15 11:28:27
Right - buying bitcoin isn't much different from buying anything else with a volatile value.  You're playing the market.
But *mining* it?  You learn about the protocol and how it works.  Sure you could do that without mining (or without buying either) but you're not really involved that way.
When I started mining, I estimated I should break even by the end of this year - *just* before I started spending more on electricity than my mining efforts produced in bitcoin, and even then only because I bought used video cards dirt cheap, and had a computer on 24/7 so I could ignore the power it was drawing in my profitablity calculations.
So far I've earned back about 2/3 of my investment and with the value drop, I'm not going to complete that final 1/3 unless and until the market swings back up.
You know what?  SO WHAT?  I learned about a new technology, and had some fun doing it... and I still have some bitcoin to spend.
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:38:47


Where I see this attitude is in the area of non-reversible transactions.  Good for vendors, but bad for customers.  The community consensus is "caveat emptor", but there's a reason we have laws and agencies to enforce them.  It isn't practical in a world of 7+ billions to take the time to completely research the trustworthiness of each individual you do business with.  And we can see this in just how successful scam artists are in the Bitcoin community.


I think it does, but it needs quite a bit more development to achieve it.  I don't think Bitcoin in its current state is a suitable fiat-replacement.
@_date: 2014-01-24 20:00:07


They always have before.  But this wave of change may be different since it has the potential to replace so many diverse jobs relatively quickly. 


It's a nice goal, but there are a lot of people out there without the capacity.  And never mind that, we're finding ways to reduce the need for the high skill stuff, too.

A couple of questions:
1. The FAQ says it'll run in exchange mode, and it's like having a cryptocoin ATM.  OK... but if I'm selling BTC, where does the fiat come from and go to? Does it do deposits via Interac?
2. It says Bitcoin and Litecoin are supported.  With the recent surge in Dogecoin, are you planning on supporting it or any other crytpocurrencies?

OK, so let's talk credit in a bitcoin economy.
Start with a zero bank balance, but you have an income so you can get approved for financing.  You don't need a car, but you want one.  If you take the financing, not only are you paying interest on the debt, but the value of the debt is increasing as you go.
If you've ever looked at a mortgage, you'll see one of the attractive things about it is that inflation eats away at it at a significant rate.  Payments that seem brutal in the begining become easier as you get a cost of living raise each year, while the value of the home increases.  (This is a bit different from a car, which depreciates much faster than inflation can cover)
In a bitcoin economy, you get the opposite - you're getting a cost of living *decrease* each year (can't wait to see employers negotiate *that*!) while the value of your home (measured in bitcoin) *decreases*, and the debt remains the same.
That's going to hurt the mortgage market...
@_date: 2014-06-27 21:36:32


Being dismissive doesn't make you right. 
There are four cases:
1. Bitcoin fails in the near term.  Neither of us knows who was right
2. Bitcoin fails in the long term, after failing as a currency and being held as a store of value.  I'm right.
3. Bitcoin succeeds in the long term, after failing as a currency and being held as a store of value.  You're right.
4. Bitcoin succeeds in the long term, as a currency.  Neither of us knows who was right.

So, I can just wander in to any store in my city, and they'll accept it just like my national fiat?  Oh... wait, I have to find a store that accepts it first.

Except that by having a middleman authenticating the transaction, you have the option to have some vendor and consumer protection and conflict resolution.
I'm not saying Paypal actually *does* that, or at least that they do it acceptably well, but that is a good reason for a large, central organization to act as a middleman in a bitcoin (or pretty much any) transaction.
@_date: 2014-08-23 14:03:19
Your national fiat has an inflation rate, which can be tracked by a consumer price index - an average of the change in cost of a list of staples and common purchases.
In short, unless you're in a hyper-inflationary or hyper-deflationary economy, there's no need for a non-fiat valuation of your bitcoin to have a sense of its purchasing power.

You can always buy with cash in a face-to-face deal.  You pay a premium for doing so, but you can do it.  (For instance, at the time of this post, 1 BTC is worth around $CAN 890, but people are offering it for direct cash sale around $950)

This depends on your definition of saving.  In this instance, we're not talking banks, we're talking the equivalent of hiding it under your mattress - just leaving bitcoin in an address because deflation means it grows in value all by itself.
So, you've removed that value from the active economy... meaning you did work but didn't trade it for anything concrete - you stopped halfway through and are holding on to the abstract representation of the value of your original labour.
Somewhere, someone who would have done some labour whose results you would have purchased, suddenly finds their labour is unwanted and they don't receive any abstract representation of value in the form of bitcoin.
This is the fundamental problem with mass saving by a population under our economic system.

Right, but with the CC company requiring the billing and shipping address to match, a credit card thief needs to steal a neighbour's card and intercept the delivery (not impossible, it's been done) and then reship to someone else for BTC.  The cops will go to the thief long before they go to the person receiving stolen goods, without ever neading to hear about the bitcoin part of the equation.
You'd need to find companies willing to ship without checking against the billing address.  Not impossible, but now you need to select your trading partners carefully.
@_date: 2014-09-18 00:47:01


I think it's the other way around - the disparity arises from local resources and politics, and not being able to compensate with a central bank will make things *worse* in some cases.
Where it will help, of course, will be in those horribly mis-managed economies with hyper-inflation.


In an economic collapse things revert to pure barter, so controlling valuable resources is the best form of preservation of wealth.  Since I don't think we'll ever go full Mad Max, simply owning property you can rent out for whatever is traded is good.  A farm would become pretty valuable, too.
@_date: 2014-04-03 01:12:21


This is an irrelevant tautology.  Well, not *quite* a tautology, sometimes there's overproduction.  
Anyway, what we're really worried about is how quickly wealth is moved around, how the access to it is distributed, and how those things affect standard of living and rate of innovation.
I happen to think mild deflation spurring more people to save, slowing down our economy (but not killing it) would be a short term disruption and a long term benefit to all of us.

What would you learn from them? They're very friendly, especially to newbs.  I think that's about the limit of the lesson.
As Bitcoin is adopted in the real world, it's less and less likely to be thrown around like play money, and it's less and less likely to see general silliness adopted as the culture surrounding it.  
Do we throw fiat bills at strangers to encourage them to try cash?  No, it's serious, and so it's treated seriously.
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:31:23
Right - but the chain of transactions still exists, correct?  The coin only moves to a new address if that move is recognized by the network... so, you see a marked coin, you transfer that mark to the new address.

Obviously.  But sometimes the relationship is indirect or based on things that will obviously be of near-universal value to humans.
Territory,  water, food, and shelter are the primary universally valuable things for us (and pretty much any animal).  After that, tools and the skill to use them.  Then you get into other resources (like clay, ore, sand, etc), and finally things like labour.
Fiat's just an abstraction so we can specialize and trade our labour so we still have food on the table at the end of the day.  Are we really valuing fiat itself?  Only if you're foolish.  You're valuing what it *represents*.
The problem with bitcoin so far is that it only represents speculation on its own future value - there isn't any intrinsic value to the public ledger that's worth paying for when you can copy it for free.  There's no GDP, no gold... nothing backing bitcoin.
That's what brycey06 means by 'bitcoins derive their value from people agreeing they have value'.

It depends on your standard of living.  Where I live, most rental units are $250-$350k homes.  If you live in a similar home (and that's not too shabby if you're not sharing it with another family), you probably need about $5k/month to maintain your standard of living.  
You can make half that renting out a duplex, so two additional houses is sufficient.  Of course, if you still have a mortgage on one of those properties, you're going to need another house to cover that.

You're one person.  You don't know if you're falling through the cracks with an *incompetent* small company, or just one of a number of people being systematically defrauded.
I'd probably report the fraud to the police and see what they say.  Hell, I'd even offer to assist if they care to make a test purchase to prove fraud by donating the required bitcoin to the police and assisting them with setting up a wallet.
I don't live in BC (I'm 2/3rds of the country to the east!), and I have no idea what that region is like.  That RCMP detachment could have 3 guys in it or hundreds.  They might have a large computer crimes / forensics department or nothing at all.   An offer to assist might be the difference between them being able to investigate or just putting it on the back burner because it's such a small fraud (unless and until they get thousands of other complaints).  Plus, they get to have some exposure to the growing world of cryptocurrency-based frauds.
Then again, it's the RCMP.  If they really want, they can just push it up the chain until they get to a big enough department that the resources are available. (Not going to happen for a $20 crime)

This is more or less my stance - I don't have much, but that just means I don't stress when the price drops.  If bitcoin crashes and burns, I walk away and don't look back.
I don't think it's going to crash and burn.  I think it's more likely that, in at least one geographical area, it'll hit a critical level of infrastructure and become a defacto secondary currency... maybe with a lot of exchanging back and forth with USD.  If and when that happens, entrepreneurs will ensure it happens again and again and again, until bitcoin acceptance is as ubiquitous as debit card acceptance.
There still needs to be a solution to the confirmation time problem first, though.  Otheriwise, the niche is too small and I don't see BTC getting traction to survive long term.

When BTC was cheap, lots of people mined for curiosity, didn't bother to keep it.
When it spiked, people mined to get rich, dumped and forgot when it fell the first time.  Maybe the same thing happened during the next cycle.
Plenty of people do a bit of mining, never accumulate anything more than a few pennies, then ditch it.
Plenty of people screw up a transfer or get a corrupted wallet without knowing how to backup or restore their private keys.
A lot of people are HODLing hoping to get rich for no effort.
Yeah, this is a big problem for Bitcoin.

It doesn't really work that way on paper.  Barter is illegal in most places.  You have to assign a fiat value to all goods and services and pay your taxes on the transaction based on that value.
That the values can zero out doesn't really matter.
And there are all sorts of things a merchant can't take in exchange for goods or services - the world is full of prohibited or restricted items and substances.  It isn't inconceivable that bitcoin could be added to the list.

The problem is that money represents economic output.  This is actually why it's not entirely evil to just print more fiat currency - there's more output added the economy all the time that needs representing.  I can't imagine the method for matching freshly minted currency to GDP is anything but voodoo and bullshit, though.
However, if you accept the idea that currency represents value, and it's the value of the work people are doing... money saved is labour (temporarily) lost.  It's like kicking a ball but you don't know how far in the future the ball will actually start to move.
Too much saving is, by definition, people NOT encouraging more economic output from their fellows.  Worse, if saving is too widespread, the saved amounts become worthless because they're outside of the economy.  The value removed means the cost of everything else goes up to compensate.
Now, I'm not sure that's such a bad thing, but we as a society aren't really set up to handle everyone lowering their productivity level substantially without it turning into a recession or depression that causes things like starvation and homelessness.

It might not be a bad idea to have a *portion* of donations so targeted.  Sure, you feel a bit slimy, but the donations still go to a good cause... and more publicity will hopefully translate into more market presence which means more potential to raise funds in the *next* cycle.


To be fair, this is the only Bitcoin community I've seen.  I got started in Bitcoin because a couple of people I suspect were high on last year's spike were tipping BTC like it was growing on trees.  Without them, I probably would have ignored it all.


Scammers will always find opportunities.  I'm sure Bitcoin has any number of scams going right now, and they're not any less scuzzy just because the community is more serious.  There's a lot of potential for pools to skim extra profits, for instance.  I'd be surprised if it *wasn't* happening.

I don't think there is a way around this - Bitcoin has nothing to do with exchanges.  Once you transfer your BTC to an exchange for trading, it's all internal accounting.

Bitcoin is a shitcoin, too; it's just first and biggest.

As long as you need to get your hands on bitcoins to move your fiat, it's an incomplete system.  And it's not *micro*transactions that are the problem, it's that bitcoin is good at *mega*transactions and not so good at day-to-day regular transactions.
Bitcoin needs to have at least the same utility as fiat to catch on, and that means I need to be able to buy $1 worth of something from the corner store with it.  Actual microtransactions would be more of a bonus giving extra utility to the crypto.

This was always silly.  Merchants doing instant fiat conversion had to get those bitcoins from someone... someone who will replace them.  They should be net-neutral on the value in that respect while increasing the number of transactions and showing bitcoin to be a valid merchant payment option, eventually leading to higher demand and value.
What's really nice is to see 2-of-3 arriving as an option.  Bitcoin needs to do more than simple transactions, and multisig opens the doors for all sorts of additional handling of transfers.
I still have reservations about the finite supply, blockchain growth, and slow speed of adequately confirmed transactions.  The latter two can be resolved by clever devs.  The first one, not so much.

Because MtGox was predicatable, and only overly enthusiastic people who ignored common sense continued to trade with them after the signs became apparent.
You don't invest in a mutual fund without reading about it, why would you throw large amounts of money at an unregulated exchange without doing at least that much?  Why would you keep putting money in once you're aware it's poorly set up and poorly managed?
The failure of MtGox is a failure of the investors more than the exchange itself.  In the long run, bitcoin will recover and become more stable as a result.
What you should take from this is that you don't just throw money at a fad.  Do your research first, and don't risk more than you can afford to lose.  This doesn't just apply to bitcoin, but to ANY kind of investment.

Yes, it does.  I have one general identity registered with the bank, and under that identity I have several accounts.  Each shows a different balance, and I can transfer funds between them.




Which wallet software are you using, because *mine* doesn't do that.  And even then, that's not n-of-m, where you could have n of m keys required to authorize a transaction (in most cases, 1 of 2 or 2 of 3).




You know what a wallet is?  It's where I go to get access to my ID or access to my funds.  And if the security of bitcoin is so weak you have to cycle addresses with every use, it's never going to take off without some kind of static meta-address added.  This is the reality of how people use it.




Wow.  You can read a QR code with your eyes?  And what, share one by sketching it in the air with your fingers or something?  QR codes are NOT an example of 'an address easily communicable by a human'.




Let me be explicit.  There is no button in my wallet app that says, 'Print private keys'.  There is no button in my wallet app that says, 'Enter private key'.

What will happen is they will be drowned out as bitcoin becomes more mainstream.  They will never stop screaming.
They won't even try and be quiet and 'let the revolution happen' because deep down, they know bitcoin won't actually overthrow so much as a single government, and even the banks will adapt if bitcoin becomes serious competition to their business model.

Of course, why wouldn't it be?  
You'd need 2-3 addresses (depending on whether the main receiving address is a pass-through or if you want to use it as one of the final destination addresses).
The wallet would have a primary address, and initiate appropriate payouts when anything was received by that address.  In fact, the wallet wouldn't even need to have access to the other account(s), as it's sending only.
I don't think anyone has done this yet, but I'm sure it's a feature that will eventually be implemented as it's a common enough thing to want.

Essentially, yes.  Beyond a minimum scale of complexity and numbers of people (and both are pretty small numbers) you get endless bickering and no actual work gets done.
Once there are enough people involved that at least partial anonymity is possible, you get one or more people abusing the group's trust as well, acting parasitically.
The solution (that will spontaneously happen in groups of people) is that someone takes charge through strength of personality (or strength of arms in a primitive enough environment) and the rest of the group agrees to comply.  Compliance is then enforced by peer pressure.  
Scale it up, and compliance enforcement is handled by chosen members of the group to allow the remainder to be free of worrying about it.
Leaders and enforcers naturally emerge in complex social systems, and humans are not special in this regard.

Sports or design aren't really good targets, and the crypto subreddits already know as much about each other as they want to.  I suppose new crypto-accepting businesses might want some of these ads, though.
I guess I'm just wondering why there isn't a basic a la carte system where you can build your own package of whatever subreddits you want, subject to availability.

There should be a *choice* between security through public scrutiny and security through anonymity... though there's also overlap because you can look still get some useful information from looking at an organization's transactions even if you can't identify the other end of them reliably.
An exchange that wanted to have a solid reputation would never use mixing when transferring bitcoin from an internal exchange account to a customer's personal address.


Which sounds nice, but suppose a court determines the transaction should be reversed (we're not going purely on mob rule, right?).  What happens if the two parties are in different legal jurisdictions?  Never mind that, how will you ensure that the reversal process is never abused?  Who is going to authenticate valid reversals when bitcoin doesn't play well with trusted central authority?
The answer is *know who you're dealing with, even if the network doesn't*.  Somebody steals your bitcoin via fraud?  Well, if you know who they are, use the courts.

Bitcoin has three issues going against it in my opinion:
First, the blockchain grows too quickly.  There are ways to trim it, but the dev community needs to figure out the details, lock it down, and push the update.
Second, transaction speed is too slow - it has to be competitive with credit and debit card transactions, and maintain trustworthiness (ie, you can't get around the speed issue by going with zero confirmations).
Third, the much lauded finite supply.  This was a mistake.  Bitcoin gets lost, and more people adopt it all the time.  A finite supply means eventually there won't be enough even if you drop to the Satoshi level.

Foolish if so, since it seems like an easy way to funnel money out of the west into China - Internet sales for BTC, convert BTC to EUR or USD.

Meh.  Anyone who has bitcoin to use understands this part, those who don't are probably oblivious.
As long as you support traditional methods that have some consumer protection, customers can have a level of trust.
Once you already accept bitcoin... what does it cost you to maintain it?  If you're holding instead of converting to fiat, it costs you nothing.  And honestly, for a few small orders here and there, if your profit margins allow the potential loss... why not?
OTOH, if you're doing instant conversion to fiat to avoid risk, you could be losing more in fees than you're gaining in sales, and should dump bitcoin ASAP.

An interesting idea, but I think if I was going to make an ATM I'd want a machine that:
* Is a thin client for a server (allowing monitoring, setting exchange rates, rotating wallets, etc)
* Has a touchscreen interface
* Handled Canadian and American money
* Could accept Bitcoin and dispense cash
* Has a secure shell design that would make theft difficult
* Comes with the option to handle multiple altcoins
* Diverts a transaction fee to a third address
Obviously, that'd be well beyond what this machine is meant to do, which is play with the basics.
Maybe such a project should be funded by the Bitcoin community... it would certainly speed adoption if every corner store and coffee shop could have a small box made for a few thousand that would sit on their counter, handling small Bitcoin transactions and collecting 1% in each direction...

1 Doge = 1 Doge?
The lack of volitility in this respect is meaningless.  The utility of owning bitcoins is in their purchasing power - the wealth they represent as communally agreed upon by others willing to exchange goods, services, or fiat for bitcoin.
The fact that 1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin regardless of the market doesn't help you when you want to buy something and the price has dropped 50% since yesterday.  THAT is the kind of volatility that matters.  And I'm reasonably confident that it will only become steady with an increase in adoption.

Yep.  Unless mixing services become ubiquitous and extremely inexpensive, Bitcoin is a power-mad dictator's dream currency.
At some point, you're going to pay taxes, or make a loan payment, or pay a utility bill, or *whatever*, and suddenly your entire financial transaction history is at risk of being publically attributable to you.
Every transaction can be traced.  Forever.  All you need to do is tie an address to someone's confirmed ID *once*, and you can follow the trail back as far as you want.  Different addresses?  Well, yeah, but we notice that both addresses seem to initiate a lot of traffic from the same IP...
And you can use VPNs or whatever you want in an attempt to obscure your trail - but that's *you*.  And you can still be subjected to the more traditional 'rubber hose' technique.  That won't be necessary for the common person, though.

Find a major ISP, partner them with a small bank that wants to be huge and a consumer goods reseller.
Get them to give out an installer for wallet software with every signup - customized so on installation it creates an address and registers with the ISP and bank and collects $20 in XBT.  Once the bitcoin is received, there would be an active link in the bottom of the wallet status screen leading to the consumer goods distributor's web site.
The ISP becomes a major player in bitcoin (probably through additional parterships hosting bitcoin-enabled retailers, reselling bitcoin PoS terminals, etc).  The bank is the first to market with bitcoin credit options... bitcoin credit cards, lines of credit, mortgages, and even traditional savings accounts.

I'm sure somebody out there can do the calculations on how profitable it would be to purchase a mining rig over 1,2 &amp; 5 years with reasonable assumptions on electricity costs, increasing mining difficulty, and assuming a fairly steady BTC value.

And what I regularly say about Bitcoin - that it isn't 'safe' because a good alt could overtake it as the barrier to entry to so incredibly low - so alts aren't so safe either as if we really want to, we can have Bitcoin adopt any innovation they present to the market.

Our world is made possible by organization.  Unless you want to live in the bush with stone/wood/leather/bone technology, you're going to be part of a cooperative of individuals.  This group will require leadership to enforce cooperation where there are disagreements.  And those who are overruled will be somewhat discontented.
You are not going to change these facts.  Nothing ever will.
My government doesn't enslave me - the reality of an extremely complex society enslaves me, limits my roles and opportunities, and requires that I tithe to the common effort.  In return, even in my slavery, I get a much better existence than would ever be possible without it.
I don't want to convince you.  I know that's probably not going to happen.  I also don't need to fight you.  The world is changing, but the fundamental nature of it never changes and for people like you who believe that government is a bad idea and anarchy is a good idea, sadly, the time never seems to pass.  You are the past, but you're still here.  And in 20 years, there will be another generation of angry, impotent anarchists railing against the very mechanisms that make their existence possible in the first place.

You have just discovered a critical flaw in Bitcoin - you can't roll around on a bed covered in it.
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:08:27
I see it differently - I believe that the limited supply of BTC will eventually kill it (at some point it'll be too entrenched for everyone to agree to change the precision and the base unit won't be small enough anymore).
The ease of switching means that whatever crypto is popular at the time bitcoin dies will be the one that takes the mantle.
In the meantime, the ease of supporting multiple coins means it's almost insane not to support them *all*.  Why would a merchant lose a sale when supporting the transaction type costs them next to nothing?  It would be like accepting MasterCard and turning down all other credit cards.  Sure, places *used* to do that, but I can't recall the last store I saw with a sign advising only a particular credit card was accepted.

[*Disclosure: I spend more time in than here - this post is intended to address a single concern only without regards to my other critiques of Bitcoin.*]
Banks.  You go to a bank and open a Bitcoin account, they issue you a private key to a 1-of-2 multisig account.  If you forget your password, you go back to the bank and have them generate a new address and shift everything over.  
And yes, you can also do this privately, but you gain the advantages of traditional banking by using this method.
You might even get a Bitcoin account that acts more like a debit card, with daily withdrawl limits to reduce the risk of loss to fraud/theft, topped up from a secondary address as required.
It also opens up the possibility of lines of credit, interest payments, etc.
@_date: 2014-02-07 00:53:58
And for exchanges and press to switch to using such as a base unit.
We as a community should probably be pushing that - because even though it's really impressive to say 1 BTC = $1000, it would be much better for day to day use if we were saying 1 ~~uBTC~~ mBTC = $1, and almost always dealing with numbers to the *left* of the decimal point.
@_date: 2014-02-13 15:33:59
OK.  Gotcha.  So at some point a secondary service is required to exchange your crypto for fiat, or (if you're selling crypto) to charge up your crypto supply.
If you're not going to handle that directly, have you considered partnering with another company to offer a complete package?
I imagine a merchant might like the ability to plug in an Interac debit card once or twice a day and convert the crypto to fiat... or top up the wallet if they're acting as a crypto PoS.

Here's another tip I just thought of - cue cards are *death* for public speaking.
Know your subject inside and out, memorize the points you want to make (and possibly the order in which you want to hit them), maybe go through a few possibilities.
When the time comes, you want to speak directly to your audience and never have to glance at a cue card.  So many people lock up and end up reading the cue cards, or get flustered flipping through them, or have to start over if they've memorized everything in order.  The absolute most you should have is the most important points in bullet form in case your train of thought is derailed.
If you know your subject, you can talk about it without needing a set script... and this means you can handle being heckled or questioned by your audience.

Ahh, the denial of the fanatic.  I won't claim altcoins *in general* aren't parameter tweaks of Bitcoin designed exclusively for pump &amp; dumps.  That doesn't mean all alts are devoid of innovative features.
I'll give you the easiest one - Dogecoin and their 'innovation' of simply leaving a coin leak in place to allow for ongoing inflation.  The concept of inflation makes a lot of Bitcoiners froth at the mouth, but there's solid economic reasoning behind it beyond evil cabals of bankers stealing value from your pocket to fund their control of the government.
And that's not *really* an innovation.  There are a couple of genuine ones out there (at least) and your attitude is why there is no discussion of bringing them into Bitcoin.

If it's really such a big problem, then the devs could declare that 10% 'lost' and update Bitcoin to allow them to be destroyed and re-mined.
I actually think it would be a great update to Bitcoin to invalidate any coin not moved in [x] years and reissue via mining allocation.  All you (as a long term holder) would have to do is bump from one address to another periodically, not such a big deal... but there would no longer be a way to 'destroy' bitcoin simply by losing your keys, eventually it would return to the ecosystem.

I will be completely honest here - it was a sizable tip December of last year that got me into Bitcoin in the first place.
It's the lack of places to spend it (pretty much everything you can buy with Bitcoin is still much easier to buy with a credit card, and using that credit card in most cases carries advantages over Bitcoin), my complete failure to raise funds for charity with it (despite watching scammers walk away with millions, which makes it more frustrating), and the venomous fanatics of the community that attack anyone who questions their frequently irrational beliefs... these are the reasons I sold my bitcoins for dogecoin, and why I don't spend much time in anymore and spend a lot more in Good luck with the project - and I really do mean that - but be aware that it takes a lot more to keep something going than it does to launch it.  To win at a social level, Bitcoin needs to shed a lot of what are currently its core supporters.  To win at a market level, Bitcoin needs to adapt *a lot* to what the market demands, instead of expecting the market to change to what Bitcoin offers.

Mark's MO would be more along the lines of providing half-assed service (which he did!), making excuses to calm complaining customers (which he did!), then fleeing when caught not providing what he promised (which he didn't).

I think the easiest adoption in the world requires instant conversion to fiat.  There are apparently a couple of services that do this, though I'm not sure on the cost.  It's *not* going to be zero, though.
As a gimmick to draw in geeks, it's excellent and in terms of space in the store you only need a device to monitor transactions (like, say, any smartphone with a wallet app) and a laminated QR code for easy scanning.
I'd suggest selling it to the owner as a exactly that - an inexpensive sales campaign.  If it fails, you're out the cost of setting up your BTC-&gt;fiat transfer system.  Compared to, say, a new sign or an advertisement in a local paper, that might be negligible.

IF you really wanted to do it:
* Have the mint premine based on the estimated amount in circulation.
* Have the banks exchange fiat for the crypto at 1:1
* Have the coin code adjusted so a privileged address can set the inflation rate, releasing new coin for mining.  
* You would probably have privileged mining addresses that would get the lion's share of newly released coin, leaving only enough to encourage general network support.  Or maybe not, maybe you'd simply have the bank run the nodes.
The point is, you CAN replace the current fiat system with a nearly-identical cryptocurrency equivalent.
@_date: 2014-04-14 14:23:55
I'm neither bear nor bull, just someone who plays with mining on a spare computer and thinks bitcoin has potential.
That peak was a bubble built on pure ridiculous speculation (as probably were prior bubbles, but I don't know much about them).  It should be discounted in any reasonable assessment of bitcoin's 'natural value'.
Now, whether that 'natural value' is currently $5 or $500, I couldn't tell you.  It just isn't $1000.
@_date: 2014-10-06 00:24:06
For every bitcoin sold, someone has to buy one, otherwise there's no transaction to show a price to the public.  That assumes an honest exchange, which isn't necessarily a given as recent history has shown.
Anyway, you get BTC how?  Well, a lot of people get it from mining.  Which means it's new.  So no fiat was given for it - there was no 'buy' anywhere.  Now you spend it, and the merchant gets it instantly converted... there's a 'sell'.
Unless people are buying as fast as they're selling, prices will tend to move.  And I suspect right now mining is still putting more coins into circulation than buyers want, which drives the price down.
The price has only been so high so long because of enthusiastic speculation.
Just don't ask me what the 'natural' price of 1 BTC would be, because I have no idea.  I'd tend to set it at the cost to mine it, but the competition to mine drives up the hashrate, which drives up the difficulty, which drives up the cost.
I think, perhaps (and I'd need someone with a better sense of Bitcoin economics and some math skills to confirm) a better measure would be the cost to mine given only the minimum amount of mining occurring to support network transaction volumes.
And I'd bet that's a LOT lower than the current price.

The kinds of people who think that libertarian/anarchist roots are still important to what Bitcoin is becoming are the problem.  Their baby has outgrown them and they don't like that it's 'selling out'.
People (like me) come along, and all we care about is how to get BTC and how to *use* it.  Some for playing around as daytraders (including the pump &amp; dumpers), some who just want to actually use it for legal trade.  I don't care if it's "sticking it to the man", and beyond reasonable comfort with the security, I don't care if the code is awesome.

Not just 2 of 3, but even 1 of 2.  Imagine a joint address held like many couples have a joint account.  Or for use as a line of credit - you get one key to an address and have to keep it topped up or pay interest.
I think another 'killer app', though possibly too difficult to implement, would be the ability to encode a transaction fee into an address - make it so every move (in, out, or both, depending on how you set it up) results in set percentage being split off to a secondary address.  I know you could set up a wallet app to do this, but if it was encoded in an address and all bitcoin apps respected it, it becomes more powerful.
And while we're at it - something needs to be done to trim the blockchain.  Its growth rate must accelerate with adoption.  Would it really be so bad if bitcoin not moved in 'n' years was 'destroyed' and an equivalent amount of new coin made available for mining?

There's still the threat of all those coins being 'recovered' and dumped on the market, I suppose, but really the latest statement took MtGox out of the equation.
Heck, now there's no excuse for continuing to list MtGox exchange rates, so people looking at average BTC values will no longer be fooled into thinking they're lower than they really are... which means a phantom surge in value inspiring confidence in people who aren't really paying close enough attention (lots of people, unfortunately).

"Bitcoin is a method to enable tax evasion, destabilize the national currency (and therefore the economy), and enable black market transactions"


Bitcoin has some media buzz and a few big shots have commented on it.  It also has a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the US economy tied up in it.  It would literally be a column inch or two on a slow news day if it died.
Don't get me wrong - I see the potential of bitcoin, and I certainly hope it takes off (and *doesn't* seriously disrupt the economy as it does so, because I like steady employment).  I simply think that potential is a lot more fragile than a lot of others do.

Not sure... but what would be better (regardless) would be to embed your alias choice for an address into the blockchain.  It would be trivial to check for duplicates or changes.

Investing is a form of gambling, however there's an additional distinction of investing being done based on the fact that the outcome is susceptible to prediction with enough information, while gambling is almost always pure chance.
Investing is very closely related to insurance, a way encourage participation by reducing risk from potentially profitible but uncertain ventures.
Having blathered on about all that - I fundamentally agree with your premise.  There just isn't enough information available yet to predict bitcoin's future with enough reliability to start calling it an investment instead of a gamble.

This, BTW, is the fault of anti-Jew laws preventing them from property ownership.
It was convenient for kings to let the Jews be moneylenders who needed to charge high interest to make a living - because the kings could then take the money from the Jews instead of taxing the population directly.
Every once in a while, Jews would become really unpopular and the crown would step in to moderate things so they didn't lose their surrogate taxman.

Possibly the community could agree to 'approved, low-frequency exchanges' and impose a huge tax on money coming from wallets known to belong to exhanges that aren't approved... but it would probably take longer to implement than to work around that, even if you could get community agreement and devs to code for it.

Credit is a way of spending the fruits of your future labours before you've performed them.  In the case under discussion, it's because you want to have a house now instead of saving up for 20 years to buy it.

It can't (long term), because bitcoins get lost.  It's not a limited supply currency - it's a *shrinking* supply currency.  There will need to be changes so that the network operates with smaller and smaller units over time, and I believe there's a limit to how far that can go.
I actually am coming to believe that maybe Dogecoin chose the better path - reduced mining but fresh coin in small amounts on an ongoing basis.  Orphaned coin isn't so bad in such a case, and as demand is still likely to outpace supply for the foreseeable future, it's still going to be a somewhat deflationary coin for a while.
I'm not a cryptocoin dev, so I've no idea whether this is a trick that Bitcoin could adapt or if it would require wholesale replacement of the system.

It doesn't work that way.  If fewer and fewer coins are actively traded because they're making their way to hoarders, there's less and less moving around on the exchanges... volume matters as much as price per unit.  As the volume drops, so does confidence, so does price... and it's easier to move the price with fewer players with fewer units on the exchanges.
Actual use gives value to the users, and places to use gives opportunity for actual use.  This is what gives value outside the exchanges, and why I believe merchant adoption is critical to bitcoin's success.  What worries me about *this* crash compared to the previous ones, is that bitcoin is finally getting some serious media attention and merchant adoption... early adopters who get burned and drop out are less likely to try again, and the pool of potential early adopters is not infinite.
Without real world adoption as a currency, bitcoin trading on exchanges is just gambling based on bluffs, with wealth migrating from the small time players to the whales.

Far superior *how*?  Imagine if a national bank released a crypto-equivalent of their fiat currency, and could 'print' as much of it as they wanted... but *only* they could print it.  How about the ability to flag units of value as stolen, so that funds could be instantly confiscated?  How about building into the system an automatic percentage funneled to a government pot?
Now you have an instant electronic replacement for paper money that the government has no problem with... they still control the money supply, they can take it back from you, and they have a taxation system that collects from any economic activity and is unavoidable.
Not very much in line with the ideals of most cryptocurrencies, but for the average citizen it might be tolerable due to the advantages.  Privacy, for instance... why would the government care who you are once they know they're *always* getting their cut?  Also, with government support if the crypto is threatened by technological advance the bank would always have an obligation to swap it back to fiat.

The problem with bitcoin in this respect:
* It wasn't 'pre-mined'.
* Well, yes it was - so few people knew about it there's little difference but semantics.
* Well, no it wasn't - so few people *cared* about it they probably lost their private keys because bitcoin wasn't worth anything except as a geek experiment.
* Well, yes it was - Satoshi is an all-knowing God and he must have kept his stash safe.
Basically, we should treat bitcoin as if it was pre-mined... while knowing we could be incorrect.  It's uncertain if someone is going to dump all that coin on the market one day.

All of which is beyond the transaction - money for a service.  
Which is my whole point... the transaction and its purpose cannot and should not be separated.  My theoretical transaction is perfectly voluntary, and you not liking the purpose of the transaction doesn't change that one bit.

If you use the money, and the transaction was done in a way that identifies you, then yes.
Buy something and the location and time might be known, then the police check the surveillance footage at the merchant's location and see your face at the time of the transaction, using Bitcoins (which will look quite a bit different from cash or a credit card swipe, even on a poor-quality security camera).
Now, ask yourself if that expertise exists within the average police department, and if you're going to do something significant enough that they'd hunt you down even if it did... and I think you'll find they'd be putting in enough effort in such a case to find you without the QR code and blockchain.

Impossible.  This is a nonsensical question.
OTOH, if you meant "how difficult would it be to encode ownership of something in the blockchain", then I suppose you could create a couple of addresses, put some bitcoin in one of them, then create a transaction moving some bitcoin from one address to the other with a note containing a description and serial number (or other unique identifying information) of the item in question.
From that point on (so long as the blockchain exists untrimmed), you can demonstrate you had ownership *at the time of that blockchain transaction* by demonstrating control of the address.
That still leaves the possibility you stole the private keys or sold the item since.

Right.  You'd have to track the overchain and your regional blockchains.


Regions are defined areas, you give a lat/long pair to your wallet software which chooses the best region for you as your 'home', and your addresses are homed to that region.
Most people only require fast transactions in person, so if your coins need to move between regions because you're purchasing on the Internet, the additional confirmation time isn't a big deal.
If you're going on vacation, you could enter the destination's lat/long into your wallet and have it move some coins to a new address homed in the new region.

The day might come where the merchant doesn't care what coin you're spending, so long as there is an exchange somewhere that will convert it into whatever he does want.
At that point, you could make your own altcoin, register it and put a buy order on an exchange, walk to the store and purchase in that altcoin.
Bitcoin's infrastructure is very easily coopted by the competition.
@_date: 2014-08-08 13:50:20


There's nothing stopping you from buying Dogecoin or Litecoin directly with fiat.  There's nothing stopping a conversion service from taking advantage of that and skipping Bitcoin.
There is an actually, in-the-wild implementation of an inline processor exchanging altcoin for bitcoins before passing the bitcoin to the merchant (who presumable then uses a merchant exchange service to get fiat).
Exactly what is stopping the merchant's service provider from supporting altcoins directly, eliminating the middleman and bitcoin simultaneously?
What's stopping companies from selling 'gift cards' that are measured in their own branded altcoin... and then having that altcoin have instant value since it can be exchanged for goods of a known value, and having that coin used elsewhere?
Nothing but a bit of code.  If you accept bitcoin, you can accept any altcoin without using bitcoin at all.

Density of adoption sites is just as important as quantity.
Bitcoin can be *temporarily* bigger than a lot of fiat currencies, but if it's spread too thinly nobody has an opportunity to *use* it on a significant scale.
Web-based shopping helps a bit, but there are still geopolitical barriers that make such things less attractive than more local purchases - and some things (like your morning coffee) will always be bricks &amp; mortar.
Without decent opportunities to use it, bitcoin could burn out as early adopters lose enthusiasm.

If Bitcoin were the standard for value transfer, then Bitcoin would be used exactly the same way - and all privacy enhancements you can use to disrupt the audit trail would be implemented by the people doing so.


While it's a PITA, at least much of the risk of identity theft is covered by your bank.  There is no coverage if your wallet is comprimised.


There are only voluntary fees right now, but as mining becomes less profitable there *will* be mandatory transaction fees or the miners won't mine... and the network will shut down.
As for inefficiency?  Mining is burning a *lot* of fossil fuels right now that traditional electronic funds transfers don't need to.


So... 99% of the population.  I'm in IT.  People like that keep me employed, and I'm not worried about collecting a welfare cheque any time soon.


You're going to have to show your work... because the actual electronic tracking and transfer of funds in the current system is far more efficient than Bitcoin ever could be with the PoW system, and the additional overhead is due to services banks provide that people will want regardless of whether they're using fiat or crypto.

However, if I do find something to spend my coin on, it's gone.  I won't be going to an exchange or ATM or LocalBitcoins to restock it.  I get paid in fiat, and 100% of my expenditures are in fiat.  Adding in conversion fees just to use crypto doesn't really make a lot of sense.

Because you listed entertainment items as things that couldn't be put off.  They are *easy* to put off.


It's not about that $0.10.  It's about a pattern of behaviour that could *include* that $0.10.  And there are a LOT of entertainment items that cost enough that 1% is significant.  A concert,  play, a major sporting event, a vacation.  Hundreds to thousands of dollars, making 1% something you'd actually notice if it were still in your wallet.

The gold rush is over.  I doubt anybody (except perhaps pool operators, mining rig suppliers, and botnet coders) is getting rich in the mining game at this point.
However... should bitcoin really take off the market for POS terminals, fiat exchanges, bitcoin credit institutions, etc will be significant profit opportunities.

I trust a sudden drop to be reflective of the market because it means people don't believe in the price enough to buy up the stock/commodity/whatever and prevent the price from falling further.
I don't trust a sudden rise, because it can't possibly be rational buyers buoying the price.  NOTHING HAS CHANGED in the last 24 hours, therefore the lowest price we hit is what the market is actually willing to pay in quantity.
If the current price was 'correct', then we never would have seen the drop.
I tend to believe in long, slow climbs in value and spikes only when new information is available to justify them.
So, basically, what I'm saying is I don't expect this rally to last.  OTOH, I thought once we broke through the 380 floor the game was over and we should brace for impact, so what do I know?

I've often thought that central banks should consider creating their own cryptocurrencies, controlling the nodes and release of new coins... an electronic flavour of the fiat they currently issue.
Such currencies would have all the inflationary disadvantages of fiat, but they'd still be blind to borders and subject to privacy via mixing services.  Some of what is wrong with fiat would go away, but some of what doesn't work with cryptocurrencies would also be fixed.
With a government accepting an altcoin (and only their own altcoin) as an alternative payment method for taxes and utilities, I think you'd see the devaluation issue more or less resolved.
The question then becomes 'why would a government do this'?

I see four kinds:
1. Anarchist.  Hates 'the system' - not just banking, but can't see how hilariously stupid it is to champion bitcoin as an alternative when it is utterly depended on massive levels of cooperation in a myriad of areas of society that couldn't exist at the required scale without governments.
2. Daytrader.  Could give two shits about bitcoin except that it's going to make them rich fleecing people who aren't smart enough to come up with a 'system'.
3. Geek.  "Let's play with this, it looks fun".
4. Believer.  Think bitcoin could be a really good alternative to current wealth transfer systems if it catches hold.  Not sure if it will, but hopeful.
I could really do without the first two groups.  Sure, the first group started the ball rolling, but despite their technical expertise they're annoying, sanctimonious fools.  The second is probably more or less an inevitable and regretable result of human nature wherever there is money to be made.

When it's cost prohibitive in the short term and doesn't look like it'll improve in the mid term, miners will stop mining and the difficulty will adjust downward.  Nobody's going to leave their mining rig on for $500 worth of bitcoin that costs them 100x that in electricity.
A sudden drop in BTC value can leave the difficulty higher than it's worth to mine for the short term, but it fixes itself over time.  Either the price recovers or miners drop out.

Touched on it, then ignored it because it can't be determined from available data.  It looks like the author just guessed that the average bitcoin holder has two addresses.
@_date: 2014-04-01 22:00:06
If you can match an address to a person, you can track a value to or from that address.
If they send values from that address, you know they're 'spending' them, but you don't yet know on what... you need to match another address.
Now, imagine you have 10 people with rolls of quarters, each quarter has a unique serial number on it.  They each count how many quarters they have, throw them all together in one big pile, and withdraw the same number of coins that they originally had.  You now can no longer trace the source and destination when this method is used as a middle-man.
And there are legitimate reasons (privacy in a public ledger) for doing this.  I don't need my boss or neighbours knowing what I'm spending my money on, or where I get other funds from.  It's nobody's business but mine.
The only time it's worth marking coins (really... just watching an address) is when someone says they've lost access to them and you want to catch them lying about it.
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:02:16
Perception matters, because it affects consumer confidence.
And let's take that 99% number for a moment... if 1% of transactions are insecure, and bitcoin gains widespread adoption, that means 1% of transactions are just waiting to be turned into thefts.
Even if it's 99.999% safe, wouldn't it still be worth looking into ways to get it closer to 100?  Wouldn't it be better to have a verified transaction *quickly*, instead of having a quick transaction... but you get to wait 10 minutes if you want to be *sure*?
Bitcoin is *not* perfect, and there's nothing wrong with trying to improve it.

The total so far (the drive ends at year's end): approximately CAD 30, which I'm going to send to Ronald McDonald House.
The nasty, vocal component of the community drove me to Dogecoin and I now hang out mostly in because (oddly enough) it's generally easier to discuss crypto there without getting into 'religious' wars, and certainly easier to vent about the fanatics.

This is not a Bitcoin innovation, and the Bitcoin implementation of it (POW) is considered to be many to be ridiculously wasteful because it's essentially random calculations that don't do anything except prove you're participating in the network.  We're converting a lot of electricity into heat without getting much information processing out of the effort.


Bitcoin is *possibly* revolutionary within a small corner of a field of mathematics.  Outside that it is merely evolutionary and may be a dead end that never achieves its full potential.


This is categorically untrue.  Against pretty much any single economy in which you find bitcoin holders, you will find Bitcoin is a more or less irrelevant fraction of their economy.
Not a single vendor who isn't a Bitcoin exchange or a crypto-only POS system provider will hurt if Bitcoin fades away to nothing.

I believe Bitcoin has a good *potential* future.  What I am not certain of is whether it will actually realize it or simply crash and burn to be quickly forgotten.
So... I gamble $1000 - and I say 'gamble' because it's impossible for someone like me to know enough about the situation to take an *informed* risk.  When it doubles, I extract my $1000, which I now cannot lose.  The remainder - my 'winnings' - I continue to gamble with without risking my everyday funds.
It's like playing the lottery and if you get a small win, you pocket it except for just enough to buy another ticket.
You can look at historical trends all you want, but past performance is no guarantee of future returns.  You need a detailed understanding of all the forces in play and their likely actions before you can reduce your risk from 'gamble' to 'risky investment'.  
Since Bitcoin is dependent on catching on virally and NOT being banned by governments (that are frequently very much invested in their own currency being the national standard), I don't believe anyone can currently do any more than guess.

Right, but that'll take about 6 months to pay for itself, in which time the mining difficult might rise and make it take even longer - and it's burning electricity the whole time, right?
I think any suggestion for a rig should include the total upfront cost, as well as the earning potential at current mining difficulty, and then an expected break-even duration based on predicted mining difficulty rate increases.
Dropping $250 is nothing if it pays for itself in a month.  Dropping $2500 that will take a year to pay for itself and will no longer be earning $250/month at the end of that period?  Maybe not as good as a nice bond or mutual fund purchase.

There's no credit without a credit rating, and no credit rating without a confirmed identity.
When you want BTC credit, you're going to go to someone who has bitcoins, and you'll open a dual-signed address with them that they'll put a given quantity of bitcoin into.  (This lets them drain the address if you misbehave)
You'll have a signed agreement with them to return that address to its original 'full' value by a set time period (possibly plus a flat fee or percentage), or face penalties.
Those penalties will be handled the same way as if you don't pay your credit card off, or if you overdraw from your debit card (due to having overdraft protection) and then don't fix the issue.  You'll have liens put on your assets by the loaning individual or institution.

I think that's a really bad line to push.  Mostly because while Bitcoin is fundamentally a revolutionary trustless public ledger, its general utility to the average person right now is in the price of BTC measured in fiat.
Adoption is encouraged by that number, and if people waited until Bitcoin was a mature and widely adopted alternative monetary system before getting involved, it would never become one.
@_date: 2014-04-09 14:42:51


It doesn't.  Mining is what helps maintain the network, and granting coins to miners is their reward.


Mostly.  Bitcoin has utility as a decentralized ledger - it's like everyone using bitcoin is using one common superpowered accountant to maintain all our balance sheets and record transactions.  That's worth something all by itself.
The value assigned to 1 BTC comes from having more than two people using the system, without any direct connection between them all.  You have a reasonable expectation that someone else will accept bitcoin from you for goods or services, and you have a rough idea how many bitcoins they're going to want - so you know what you're willing to pay for them.
Then the speculators come in and pump up the value in expectation of future adoption driving up the base value.  Most of the time you're not looking at what one bitcoin is worth (which would be difficult to calculate) but a value based on what investors are paying for it due to the belief it will be worth a certain amount when they want to cash out.

I'm not saying a government could wipe out bitcoin entirely, but they could easily make it so inconvenient that it would be effectively dead for the average person, and useless to those who already have means.  They could drive it back to a black market currency of limited circulation.

Unless the banks successfully push a regulation that says crypto's illegal... the only danger to Bitcoin is that it will have to be used according to the same rules as fiat, which will involve reporting large sums, tracking IDs to prevent money laundering, etc.

It's so easy to be confident it will firm up and eventually rise.  I *hope* so, but I'm not confident.
Despite all the great news of vendor adoption, the bitcoin economic cycle for most people is similar to that of a gift card.  Take your fiat, buy bitcoin, buy stuff with bitcoin, vendor converts to fiat.
Well... fine for international transactions (where you'd have to do a fiat-fiat conversion and get stuck with any balance), but there's not much point to that for local stuff.
And if it's only for international transactions, how does the value get set?  At some point, that vendor abroad wants fiat.  And if the transaction is, say, an American buying from China, then somewhere a Chinese business needs to sell that BTC for USD.  (Because it'd be funny for the Chinese to give you goods for virtual currency generated by Americans, valued by Americans, but never *paid for* by Americans).  
How do the Chinese and Americans agree on a common valuation of BTC in USD?  Speculation.  And that's fine as long as it keeps working out, but I can't shake the feeling that it's a very delicately balanced house of cards just waiting for a gust of wind.
Any time there's a serious drop in the price... *that* could  be the gust.

Stability will come with market penetration.  Fiat isn't rock-stable, either, it's just that in most places there is enough invested in it, spread around across enough holders, that it's difficult for the value to change unexpectedly by large amounts.
OTOH, Bitcoin really isn't built for small transactions, or large transaction volumes.  If, magically, everyone suddenly started using Bitcoin like they currently use debit cards I have this gut feeling it'd all crawl to a halt.
I've floated a few ideas on how to fix that (high level ideas, I'm not a programmer who could code a solution), but they're generally shot down and the underlying problem denied.

At this stage of Bitcoin's general adoption an established company might add bitcoin payments because they have some in-house believers, or don't mind the cheap advertising campaign it effectively gives them, but a *new* company could be doing it because they can't make it with tradtional methods and the idea of untraceable, unreversible transactions appeals to them.

Absolutely true.


Not so true.  Anything you can own can be converted to fiat.


Absolutely untrue.  Bitcoin has some significant advantages over fiat in some cases.  Huge disadvantages in others, of course, but there's some hope those will be reduced over time.


How so?  You can buy coins face-to-face, with no ID.  Your transactions can be tracked, but unless your ID gets attached to the address during a transaction, you're totally anonymous.  Of course, the same is true with cash...
*Nothing* is immune to fraud.  People are involved, people can be scammed.
As for regulation?  Yes, there are ways bitcoin can be regulated - namely making it illegal to use as tender in a commerical transaction.  However, as long as you're willing to use something like LocalBitcoins, it's about as easy to regulate as a teenager's weed connection.


Or the elegant technology behind it, the ability to transfer wealth without regard for government or borders or huge fees or long delays or bureaucracy, or the ability to prevent ongoing fraud because your address doesn't give anyone access to withdraw from it.  Or the ability to do away with banks for basic finance - services that generally cost more than you get in interest if you're at the lower end of the economic ladder.

@_date: 2014-04-03 00:41:00


Following that line of reasoning, under bitcoin we'd see people spend their money on necessities and leave their savings in bitcoin because it grows.


Actually, you'll find that if you have a modest savings account, you'll lose ground against inflation - if not by the interest rate, then by banking fees.  If you have enough cash to avoid those fees and invest more effectively, you're already in the '10%'.  
The average person, faced with their money losing value and having no practical way to maintain it, might as well spend it.  Now see what happens when they can 'beat the bank' just by holding their balance.

It also occurs to me that hyperinflation would require creating new coins *within the same system*, and that hyperinflation would be limited to that new coin - the value has to come from somewhere, whether it be bitcoin or fiat or some other established store of value.
Just adding a new cryptocoin to the ecosystem doesn't instantly devalue the existing coins. *edit: unless, for some reason, everyone bails on an existing coin in a rush to a new one.  Same problem as with fiat, except a lower barrier to entry (you don't need to be a national government to produce a new cryptocoin).*

Not a bad attitude, if you can afford the risk.
It requires enough people with that attitude to have the whales cash out while maintaining a minimum BTC value... that might be insanely improbable.
If it works, at worst your coin is worth what you paid.  If it works well, you get rich.  If it fails, you lose it all.  On the other hand, if the whales are cashing out, you're going to lose it all anyway.  Why not throw some good money after bad (if you can afford it) in the hopes that you'll prevent a crash?

Bitcoin isn't gold - it is purely abstract and totally useless as a real-world resource.

Inflation and printing of fiat is an interesting thing - it is effectively a redistribution of wealth from non-investors to investors.  You can only maintain or grow your personal wealth by investing it in profitable enterprises - sit on your fiat and its value shrinks over time.
Is that so bad?  It's not like the poorest in our society are sitting on piles of savings anyway, and inflation encourages the middle class to put their savings back into the economy in the form of stocks, bonds, and investment funds.
Well... maybe.  I think a slower, more conservative economy would be a good thing.  I also happen to think transitioning to one from our current system would be very disruptive and damaging.

Off-chain transactions require trusting a 3rd party's accounting system, unmonitored by the blockchain.
At that point, you don't have 'bitcoins', you have tokens redeemable for bitcoins with a particular 'bank'.  Which means you have to find a vendor that is capable of accepting those tokens, and your tokens go to the vendor, through their 'bank', bitcoins are released to another 'bank' that then releases tokens for someone somewhere else.
That's fine for a tipbot on Reddit - I don't care that I don't have real bitcoins in but it's not really practical to do common transactions that way.
I thought bitcoin was about doing away with banks, but you want to not only make new ones, but have each issue their own fiat!

Pretty much the only way to do that with a cryptocurrency would be to premine it, then hand out the crypto for fiat at the set rate.  This would actually be a viable strategy for a national bank to put a crypto-equivalent of the national fiat into circulation.
However, you can't just 'fix bitcoin to the USD' because nobody's willing to guarantee that exchange rate.

I think one of the strengths of bitcoin is also one of its weaknesses - it's borderless.
That means it doesn't start in a particular location and spread - it is everywhere.  Just because there are 135k people checking in on Bitcoin in this subreddit... well, that doesn't mean jack when you're trying to connect with users in a geographically constrained way.
If those 135k people were all in one small city, you'd make a killing with an ATM.  Or by accepting BTC at a cash register.  Since they're not, a business requiring physical contact with a customer isn't likely to get much BTC traffic.
Bitcoin is almost purely for online transactions unless and until the population density of bitcoin users hits critical mass.

No, but you're focusing on non-discretionary spending (excluding the entertainment stuff, which I think you're very wrong about).   Perhaps if the deflation is strong enough, I'll decide to tighten my belt and hold off on discretionary purchases so I can afford even more next year.
You can see the opposite happen in high inflation economies, where people spend as soon as they earn because the money will be worth less tomorrow.

I actually think that governments should be very seriously looking at how they could create a crypto-equivalent of their current fiat.
I think it would simplify income and sales taxes immensely if there was a simple, very low transaction tax in their place, built into the protocol.  There'd still be property and sin taxes, but it there would be a massive cut in the amount of tax processing overhead.
It would have to be an altcoin with a single entity in charge of releasing additional coin for mining, but I imagine that wouldn't be terribly difficult to arrange.

Classic use of a stolen card is to have things delivered either to a fall guy or to a neighbour with a note to the vendor 'no signature required' so it gets left on their front step.

Right now, it's great for transferring funds when other methods would be irritating due to time, effort, or fees... but that's a fiat-&gt;bitcoin-&gt;fiat cycle.  If the goal is day to day use, it has to stay in bitcoin all the way, and be spendable under practical circumstances.

In fact, when I felt guilty about receiving money for nothing, I switched it from 'for nothing' to '[for charity]( and still received nothing.

The less competent people are (but still actually involved in something), the more overconfident they tend to be as their ignorance hides their own failings from them.  The really brilliant ones know their faults to ten decimal places.
I *hope* I fall somewhere in the middle, and have a realistic assessment of my skill set.  At least I know I'm not delusionally overconfident (because I acknowledge I'm imperfect).  Perhaps I'm an unrecognized genius! :)

Rather than a mixing service... how about a blockchain-breaking service?
You deposit into a pool address with a service, from one or more addresses and using a proprietary account with that service to identify it.  They pay back (less fees) after a random delay to one or more new addresses in mismatched amounts and email you the new information or make it available via website... and then I assume you'd immediately transfer the coin to a new address so only you had the private key.
Or is that how mixing services already work?  If I've got it right, this would break any traceable link between your deposit and withdrawl so long as they had sufficient transaction volume, unless the service was subpoenaed... and if they only kept logs long enough to confirm the transaction, not even then.

The higher bitcoin's profile, the more dangerous these drops become... the people who adopt now are the early adopters of the general public, and if they're burned badly enough they won't be willing to try again if bitcoin recovers. 
Without them, there will be no mainstream adoption, and bitcoin drops back to mere dollars per bitcoin and permanently returns to being a toy of the cryptoanarchists.

You invest when you have done your research and are confident the price is going to go up, and be ready to be wrong.  Reading doesn't count as much research, as most of the people here are enthusiasts and have trouble seeing anything but sunshine and roses.
Also - if anybody could predict it accurately, they wouldn't tell you - they'd just sit back getting rich.
Finally, despite Bitcoin being a few years old now and having a lot of money start to get invested in it by the private sector... it's still *really, really early*.  Bitcoin could be gone in six months because it's just not a compelling enough tech to displace the incumbents.  It could get steamrollered by a really incredible innovation by an altcoin we haven't seen yet.  Or it could slowly take over as the value tracking system of choice across the globe.
Nobody knows, though plenty will tell you they do.

Bad news can be accounted for and then you move on.  Uncertainty, though... 
Which is stupid because you're uncertain about bad news - so there's a value which bitcoin would have if the bad news were true and a value it would have if it weren't, and those should be the boundaries for rational trading barring other effects.
The fact that uncertainty can drive people to undervalue something is just weird.  The fact that when the value of something is based almost entirely on its perceived value, the undervaluing becomes its real value is annoying.

The difference is that people know what they can afford (well, given payday loans and maxed credit cards, maybe not so much), and they spend it.
They're buying up to their budget.  That future product *doesn't exist yet*, so they'd be waiting to buy something that doesn't exist... but they can see their bank balance (or credit limit) *right now*.
You also have to look at the mid-range purchases.  People who are poor because of insufficient impulse control will spend all they have regardless, usually on small stuff.  There are a significant number of people who can budget and restrain themselves.  These are the people who 'nest' (spend money on renovation instead of moving) to save some money, put off a vacation, drive an older car.
Give them an economy where waiting is rewarded more strongly, and they'll wait.  Maybe only a percentage, maybe not for years, but it'll add up and have an effect.

Or, people in general stick with established methods because change requires effort and the new technology was untried, untested, and not particularly inexpensive or reliable in the begining.
The 'establishment' had a functional system and didn't see the utility in trying something new.  Social inertia's a bitch.  A few people saw the new technology as a tool to acheive what they couldn't without it, so they tried it.  
They had no special insight.  From the perspective of the early days of personal computing, it was quite possible they were just foolish dreamers wasting their effort on a dead end.  We only see them as visionaries and their detractors as hidebound fools in retrospect.

If he's assessed the volatility to be beyond his threshold of tolerance, who are you to tell him he's wrong?  Bitcoin *is* extremely volatile at present.


Most of the value does appear to be kept on exchanges, which may have cold storage (if they're run well).  That's how daytraders are operating, and they're the primary drivers of bitcoin value right now.


I see this stated a lot.  I don't believe it.  They're not afraid, they just don't care because they have no need to be aware of it yet.  NOBODY is 'deathly afraid of Bitcoin'.  It's a cryptoanarchist fantasy that 'big money' is afraid of bitcoin... but so far it's just a small but interesting curiosity that may be a threat to a small portion of the finances of governments and banks.

The idea is that Joe Nobody has no idea how to invest money, nor enough money to be worth investing as an individual.  Also, having even a modest amount of cash around is an invitation to thieves.
So... banks.  You give your money to the bank, and they promise to give it back when you ask.  *And they pay you for holding it for you*.  This is because when you give money to them, they turn right around and loan it to someone else, in return for a promise to pay interest to the bank.
This loan rate is set so that, on average, it covers off defaults, pays depositors a small amount of interest, pays for the bank's operating costs, and makes a profit.  The excess doesn't come out of thin air (let's not talk about deliberate inflation by currency devaluation just yet), it represents someone, somewhere, creating new value and injecting it into the economy.  A new resource, a new product, a new service, whatever.
There's nothing fraudulent about the basics of banking.  Like insurance, banking is a very valuable economic tool for making society more productive.
It's when you get into the more abstract stuff that the potential for fraud kicks in.

That's not how you'd model a brain... you'd want to work on many different problems simultaneously and bring the solutions together into a coherent whole.
At the neuron level (we're talking hardware now, not software) you might want multiple devices that aren't completely reliable and use consensus to determine the final output.  This is how our brains work, because it turns out it takes less energy to keep your neurons on the edge of firing and average out the misfires by using clusters than it is to make them harder to fire and use a single neuron at a time.
And you really, really want everything to happen as quickly as possible.  So even if you've got your neuron clusters simulated, connecting them over the Internet is a bad idea.  There's a reason our brains are centralized and close to our primary sensory organs.

Because no government could ever levy a tax in bitcoin?  Because it couldn't assess it against your income (conveniently recorded by in the blockchain when your employer sends it to an address they report to the tax authority), or assess it against the market value of your real estate based on current sales of comparable properities, or as a simple percentage of a sales transaction?


Which would have NOTHING to do with people competing for the same space, and wanting communal infrastructure maintained.


Because there are no rental bachelor apartments, or inexpensive rural locales.

It's a bootstrapping issue.  I imagine if we get to the point where enough businesses in a small geographical area accept bitcoin that you can do a majority of your transactions in bitcoin, those businesses will start offering employees a portion of their pay in the same.

You are fundamentally wrong.
Most people hoard leads to a failure to acheive a critical mass of people  *using* bitcoin for commerce, leading merchants to stop supporting it (because as inexpensive as it is, there *are* associated costs), leading to fewer people using bitcoin.  It can start a downward death spiral.


Bitcoin needs to be an investment *last*.  The trustworthy decentralized public ledger is a revolutionary technical achievement.  Buying numbers floating around in that ledger is useful for providing some expected value to those numbers, but without widespread use of the ledger as a tool of commerce it's somewhere between 'extremely risky speculation' and a joke.

Bitcoin has become kind of stagnant.  
There's resistance to any improvements that appear in altcoins because 'scamcoins', 'shitcoins' or whatever other derisive term is used.  
There's been no improvement in making the average wallet app more non-techie friendly, and there's resistance to making the apps more intuitive by having them work more like accessing your fiat bank account because 'fiat/evil bankers'!!!
One of the big selling points for merchants is 'no charge backs'.  The flip side is 'no consumer protection', to which the community response is, 'caveat emptor'.
Protecting your address is still a bit arcane.  Asking about it is like asking the Linux community how to do an OS install 10 years ago.  Sure, there's help, but it's only really useful if you're already a Linux tech.
Essentially, the Bitcoin community seems hell-bent on selling what they have right now to merchants while telling potential consumers to take it as it is and adjust, or go to hell.
That's not really what I'd call a comprehensive vision for promoting consumer adoption of Bitcoin.

"Use my centralized system on top of Bitcoin to give up some of the features you like about Bitcoin in favor of some of those you may feel it is missing.  Because the system I'm pushing clones the functions of some promising altcoins, those altcoins are irrelevant."
Well, no, those alts *aren't* irrelevant, because they were the source of the ideas.  And not only that, they might be better than Open Transactions anyway, since they're built all in-line with their blockchain and don't have to sacrifice anything to implement them.
I really feel the anti-alt attitude among a lot of Bitcoiners is a very quixotically anti-innovation thing.  We shouldn't dismiss altcoins, but rather look at them for what they are: *mostly* pump &amp; dump scams, but also a few experiments in improving on what Bitcoin started.
If an alt comes up with something great, Bitcoin has the option to adopt it.  If it doesn't, you can ignore it.  You can rage about them, deride them, whatever... but that won't stop a single altcoin from being created.  You might as well try and benefit from their existence.

I'm treating it like it's Dogecoin.  I'm not in it for the fiat cash out, I'm in it for fun, and because I think it's a good idea if it manages to acheive wide adoption in the real world.
It's a chicken-and-egg thing, though.  It's only useful if it's used, and it's only used if it's useful.  The daytraders and cryptoanarchist purists don't help at all with adoption, and they're the bulk of the market right now.

There could be a confidence cascade failure in progress - the speculators have seen enough of a decline that they're trying to bail and making things worse as they go.  It doesn't necessarily take fresh bad news, just yesterday's drop feeding today's.
It's probably a good thing the drop is so slow.
I remain confident that adoption as a currency rather than a daytraded stock is what will stabilize bitcoin's long term value and return it to an upward trend.  American merchants have next to no risk (beyond the initial outlay for hardware if they want a POS terminal) as it's easy to get a merchant account that cashes out to fiat as quickly as they receive bitcoin.
So, if we want bitcoin to start climbing again, maybe we need to come up with a standardized 'merchant starter kit' - a pamphlet/web page/whatever that gives your average joe shopkeeper simple instruction on how to make that first sale in BTC with minimal outlay and no risk.
In fact, as an investment strategy, I'd strongly suggest that the bigger holders start spending a small portion of their bitcoin towards pushing bitcoin adoption.  Without merchants and customers making regular transactions, bitcoin will never make it to the mainstream, and eventually those investments will be worth nada.

That's been scaled back.  Now it's "the future of money for large transactions and as an investment".  Actual, practical use as a daily currency is off the table as the blockchain can't handle the load.
To do so requires off-chain processing, which isn't much different from dealing with a credit card - you're going to do business with a particular off-chain processor, who will also do business with merchants.  And they're going to charge a fee.

The largest miners aren't the slightest bit interested in BTC.  It's purely a mercenary operation for them.
When they start to lose more money than they make, they'll look at their losses and the potential for BTC recovery and decide if they should turn their farms off and sell them for scrap.
Some of them will hold on.  Many of them were likely set up based on bleeding huge profits from American consumers and when that flow dries up, they won't have the ability to continue.  They're not holding fiat, either - they're walking away with the cash ASAP and there won't be much of an operating fund.

No - but if you pay off your credit cards monthly (to avoid the obscene interest rates), it's not significantly different from debit card use.

The rest of us simply have an opportunity to represent some of our wealth in a cryptocurrency instead of fiat or other assets.

That just means the transaction initially happens via paper instead of bits - but it will eventually hit the blockchain or it's worthless.  
Am I missing something there?  Maybe the paper could change hands several times so you'd only be (erroneously) connected to the final transaction.
Perhaps we should be printing m฿ and u฿ wallets containing 1/2/5 m฿ or u฿ as psuedo fiat?  Scan to confirm the value, but don't actually make a transaction, so it wouldn't show on the blockchain.  Would that work?

So long as anyone is willing to pay to obtain it, any cryptocurrency is real.
I think the problem lies in adoption and greed.  Altcoins that are only adopted by the greedy hoping to make a quick buck aren't 'real', even though real money is eventually changing hands, because they're built to milk money from the newbs and have no long term future.

* "Satoshi" doesn't get traction outside the core of the Bitcoin community. (It's also too small at present)
* "Coin" is too generic, and sounds too much like physical money.
* "Bit" is a binary digit.
I would seriously suggest 'Credit' as the common unit, with a value set in Satoshis.  The initial value could be 100,000 Satoshi (1 m฿), but should the value of bitcoin rise sufficiently in the future it could be 'revalued' to represent 1 µ฿.
And while bitcoin is a protocol and a public ledger... let's not pretend it isn't primarily used to represent personal wealth.  Nobody's saying "Nice balance sheet", they're saying "I have x Bitcoin, and it's worth y fiat".   When talking about the values we're moving around with Bitcoin, using the word "Credit" is perfectly reasonable.
@_date: 2014-08-19 11:17:02
It is still a lot easier to buy on the web with my credit card.  The merchant loses a percentage, but I don't notice it.  I have a month to pay the fiat before interest kicks in.  I can have my credit card company reverse the charges if the company doesn't deliver as promised.  AND I don't have to worry about the purchasing power of my funds changing between acquiring them and using them.
Bitcoin?  I have to buy some on an exchange (with the exchange taking a cut I notice), then make my purchase, have no ability to reverse the transaction if the vendor doesn't deliver, and then the vendor then pays a service to do an instant exchange back into fiat, driving the price of bitcoin down a tiny bit.
Right now, it only makes sense to use Bitcoin internationally (where you're paying an exchange rate anyway), for small amounts where you don't care too much if you get ripped off.

Good, because I think the 400 floor just broke.  Coinmill says the price is now below 395.


I want to agree (fewer speculators = less volatility), and a merchant won't shelve their POS system for at least a month if they're on some kind of monthly contract.  Longer if they're only paying a transaction fee.

Where are you getting your money?  Where are you spending it?  All they have to do is make it illegal to process bitcoin payments without linking them to government identification, and they have a tighter financial grip on the public than ever before.
I actually think it would be wise of national governments to release their own altcoins where they control the release of new coin (just like they do with fiat) and where they simply take a (small) percentage of *every* financial transaction, regardless of size.
How's that for a taxation system to replace sales and income taxes?  Keep a regular property tax and various 'sin' taxes (personal and industrial) and you've still hugely simplified taxation.
Imagine - no income tax filing ever again!

This is what convinces me that the ruling elite are particularly short-sighted.
Yes, you can be stinking rich by oppressing the masses and keeping them poor.  On the other hand, you can *not* oppress them and be almost as stinking rich while being able to access the output of a much more productive workforce.  And not have to worry about revolutions quite as much.

Let me answer those points from a newb's perspective:


Bitcoiners who want more than a blackmarket currency should be doing this.  Help your local merchants (the mom &amp; pop kind) accept bitcoin.  Since it can be immediately exchanged into fiat, they don't need to worry about that, and they get a techy gimmick that might bring in a bit more business.


I think a Bitcoin charity drive (maybe regional ones) would be a great idea.  I've already tried it, but since it started as a joke it's not going so well.  I'm at around $5 so far of the $5000 I need to bother giving it to a charity.  Imagine the news items though - "Bitcoin charity drive raises $5K for local shelter" or something.  Imagine if we had one such drive per major city, and they handed over their donations (exchanged for fiat) on the same day.  That'd be very newsworthy.


Micropayments increase the value of bitcoin as a payment method.  Reddit's a (relatively) small group, but out in the wilds of the Internet this makes bitcoin much more widely useful.


Covering up something sinister is bad, of course, but we should be slamming the anti-socials of our number who drive people away.


It's good up until the word 'to'.  A bitcoin mascot might not be the worst thing ever, though I think we're stuck with the engraved gold coin as the symbol.
In short... just because Dogecoin isn't 'serious' doesn't mean there aren't lessons that can be learned from it to improve Bitcoin.

If there's a risk the coins can be proven stolen, then the reward has to be big enough to take that risk.  It also means they're more motivated to dump the entire amount and so aren't worried about flooding the market.
Basically, I can see an argument for them being motivated to behave in a way that could cause a crash after a boom.  This assumes they have enough volume to move the market drastically, of course.

My favourite is when one of the anarchist/revolutionary types is trying to seem moderate, and you see a little bit coming through in their post... and then there's a response post and they can't hold it in and go right off the deep end about how taxation is theft, fiat is a tool of the oligarchy to keep you down, and we don't need governments or even police.
They may not be the majority here, but they're the loudest.
*edit: Case in point - [a current frothing-antigovernment thread](  Somehow, these people never seem to understand that they are beneficiaries of the very system they're fighting.  You can't get hundreds of millions of people in continent-spanning civilizations working efficiently without a framework for cooperation, a central authority to manage the general direction of that cooperation, and enforcement to quell dissenters.  If you want to live in tiny city-states ruled by tyrants and thugs, without standards that allow roads, telecommunications, moderately safe streets, and relatively free travel of people and goods over distances of more than a few tens of kilometers... well, enjoy your 'anarchy', I guess.*

The Canadian exchanges take forever to get registered with, and only one that I'm aware of deals directly with Canadian dollars.
If I can go to an ATM with a debit or credit card and buy some BTC for a percentage over an exchange, it's more or less worth it to me unless I plan to do regular trading (which I don't).  It's also my only practical option for near-immediate purchase without getting royally ripped off.

Bitcoin is weighed down by fanatical anarchists, get rich quick daytraders, and fraudsters.  The community is unfriendly, which discourages new adopters.  It also has the issue of finite supply (the proponents will tell you is a good thing - I disagree).  There are altcoins that do not have these anchors around their necks, while they have all the good things that make bitcoin such an innovation.
Bitcoin may have more users than any other crypto right now, but in the grand scheme of things the bitcoin userbase is insignifiant in size. Even if it dominated the financial markets like the Euro or USD... it's so easy to switch to a new crypto (they all use the same, pre-existing infrastructure), so easy to convert from one to another... there is effectively no barrier to bailing on bitcoin and going elsewhere.
All of bitcoin's strengths can be coopted by others, while its weaknesses are difficult for bitcoin itself to eliminate.

AIPAC isn't what that quote supports - 'Jewish-funded' means some money from sources designated as 'Jewish' went to PACs that in turn made up 60% of the Democratic Party's fundraising and 25% for the Republicans.
I'd need a breakdown of the individual PACs and the ethnicity/religion/culture demographics of their donors.
I seriously doubt that even the most secret society could exclusively bring together *that* much of a share of those party fundraising budgets.  After all, it's not like there aren't many, many corporations and non-Jewish billionaires in the USA who stick their fingers in the political pie for their own reasons.
Even disregarding that... we already know how corrupt American politics are, and 60% of the policy decisions  for 60% of the bribes seems about right... and you have to figure that's just for the policies the 'Israeli lobby' cares about.  Their actual ROI is much, much lower in terms of influencing ALL policies in return for the money.
And even beyond all that, most politics in the US are split 50/50ish between parties anyway... so they're really only getting a 10% advantage over what you'd expect from no bribery at all!

I think the two things are seperate.  Doge can be *both* a fun thing for people to play with *and* a pump-and-dump.
And honestly... the people playing with it know they're playing and are OK if they lose their money.  Some of the money gets extracted to charitable causes, some of it gets transferred into BTC, and some goes to scammers.
The people profiting from the pump-and-dump are scum, but while I can blame them I have trouble sympathizing from anyone trying to get into Doge for profit and losing their shirts.

Yes.  Let's try and run a coherent operation without a hierarchy.  We'll have everyone - maintenance staff, receptionists, sales staff, etc - all gather and vote on every decision.
There's no way that'll fall apart more or less instantly for a company of any size.
When they say 'no managers', what do you do if there are personel issues, who makes decisions as to how things are going to be run, etc?  I'm guessing either the companies involved are small enough that it's the 'CEO', or if they're larger its a 'supervisor'... who is effectively a manager without the title.

Yes... I think a better way to express the value would be in units of 'hours of work at median wage'.
I know when I'm talking to my father about how much things cost when he was young, I don't look up the inflation index and convert to current fiat value... I ask him how much he was making at the time, since he had a common entry-level job.  I can compare that to what an equivalent position pays today and it makes sense a lot faster.

It's natural selection as applied to culture.  The culture that promotes and enforces behavour leading to more members raising more children will outcompete the one that doesn't.
This is fine so long as the region in which that culture exists has sufficient resources for the population growth... but eventually it's a really bad idea to have "And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein" as a sacred standard.
That's the biggest problem I have with religion - it is very slow to adapt because it's all about "Just obey authority" instead of "Do this because of this reason".  Lots of people still eat fish on Friday because a Pope banned red meat to give a boost to the fishing industry.  Many more won't eat pork because a couple of thousand years ago it was a good way to get sick.

I started knowing *nothing* about BitCoin, and I have to tell you that installing a wallet app on my smartphone made life REALLY easy.
You get reasonable levels of confirmation fairly quickly, it lets you know what your wallet address is in both text and QR code form, lets you make payments from your wallet, and also back up your private keys via email or saved file.
Heck, you can even have multiple wallets going if you need to divide things up for some reason, or want to keep a business and private wallet.
I think a smartphone would be your minimum entry into accepting BitCoin, because you get *some* verification... and if all you leave visible to the customer is the wallet app, it looks reasonably professional, too.  
That and a laminated QR code in the cab for easy scanning would probably be the easiest implementation. (The opinion of a BitCoin newb, for what it's worth)

Wall Street is the very definition of 'middle men'.  They make money by moving other people's money around.
Sure, it's been a useful economic convenience from time to time, but it's also done a lot of unethical theft at every scale of transaction, by every level of player.
If things like Bitcoin and crowdfunding eventually reduce their role in major economies... well, only the middle men are getting hurt.

Of course not.  Even in a magical future where Bitcoin is the *only* currency, it won't solve credit or investment needs.
People are going to hand over their money - whatever form it takes - to a centralized institution that will give them some kind of benefit from doing so.  
Mortgages and retirement plans will be the big ones, but plenty of people aren't patient to save up for smaller things and would rather screw their future self with debt so their present self can have something now.  There will be credit cards.  There will be lines of credit.  And yes, even payday loans.
And the first time a local economy stagnates because the value of the global currency isn't suitable for spurring local activity, there will be a region that outlaws Bitcoin for financial transactions and starts up the printing presses again.

I think the alts that actually try something different are valuable.  Given the cost of launching one (pretty much none) I don't see much harm in them failing.
A bit of money goes in, a bit of money comes out - but if some particular change seems to be working really well, there's hope bitcoin might adopt it.
They don't have to be the 'next big coin' if the intention is merely to fiddle, test, and show how great your idea is.

I could probably afford to throw a few tens of thousands at an investment without worrying about making ends meet (I'm 40, good job, been fiscally responsible all my life)... but I still think of $100 as 'a lot of money' because I rarely spend that much at once.

Since our entire economic system is based on fiat, the death of a fiat currency without a lot of changes *preceding* that death pretty much ensures economic chaos that'll make the Great Depression look like a bad weekend on the stock market.
If you truly believe there is a major change coming to our economic system, you want to prepare to have all your wealth in things that aren't affected by fiat.  Land and resources will always be required, and a land owner can rent by barter if necessary, whereas someone with all their wealth in fiat has no options.
Of course, if the death of your currency is preceded by massive inflation, keeping your wealth in a relatively non-inflating currency helps, otherwise the bank is going to take your land away from you when you can't pay your mortgage and the *banker* will get rich as you starve.

What's used in place of the blockchain?  If you need central servers and a trusted authority, then nobody's going to trust the encryption or anonymity... the servers can be comprimised by a large enough government agency putting pressure on whoever is running the system.

But mostly destroyed if users don't even realize they're using a different system.
I don't care these days if I have a MasterCard, Visa, or American Express - they all work everywhere credit cards are accepted.  This hasn't always been true.
The same could happen with bitcoin, because the infrastructure required to handle bitcoin is identical to that for every other altcoin - an Internet connection and a wallet app.  
All that's needed is an abstracted layer that doesn't care what crypto you're using, and suddenly bitcoin being first and biggest doesn't mean anything anymore.  A multi-coin wallet app and an exchange that works inline with a customer-vendor transaction and it's done.

Read the article, can't say his comment is all that off-base in context.  
"Bitcoin will make you the target of hackers who will steal your money," Abagnale said. "More expensive than other forms of payment, Bitcoin is a way to rob people of their life savings. Most important, if something goes wrong, the money may never be recovered."
Let's look at that:


Assume Bitcoin becomes a major form of banking.  Under the current setup, the average user will have a Bitcoin wallet they downloaded or a web wallet they signed up for.  It will be one keylogger trojan away from releasing the contents of that wallet, and if that happens there isn't any way to get all or even part of the funds back.  In a way, it's like converting all your liquid assets to cash and stuffing the cash in your jacket.   Perfectly safe so long as nobody sees you pulling cash out of your jacket and decides to pick your pocket.


Often argued, but so long as most of the world still deals in fiat, there are conversion fees to be considered both converting to and converting from Bitcoin.


Since with Bitcoin the onus is on the end user to worry about security, there's no bank to blame after a theft, nobody to get compensation from.

The user base is still pretty small - the popularity of this choice could change significantly in the future as the base expands.
Personally, I'm already in the 'it was a bad choice, but necessary at the time' camp.  Satoshi didn't do it because of an economic theory, he did it because he couldn't figure out how you could ensure a reasonable inflation rate in a trustless distributed system.
I think it'd be interesting to launch an alt with inflation set quarterly by miner activity over transaction volume, with an option for miner consensus (votes weighted by hashrate) to reduce it below the system-determined level.
Basically, release enough new coin to miners to keep them mining enough to support the network.

You have an 'overchain' that tracks transactions between regions.
Nodes could be full - all chains, or partial - overchain plus regional.
Transactions within a regional chain would trust each other, inter-region transactions would need to be cleared by the overchain.  If you want to spend quickly across regions, you'd create a new address in the region in which you wish to spend, or you'd 're-home' your existing address prior to the transaction(s).
The same way real banks handle things.  Yes, technically each region would have a separate coin, but you'd keep that obscured from the average user.

I disagree.  They're more willing to donate, but donate far less each.
I tried (and technically am still trying) to raise money for a couple of children's charities and since December of last year I've totalled about $12... and about half of THAT came from a single Bitcoin donor and myself.
Have a look at [the donor list with amounts](
This fundraising effort is working because it's a big deal for Bitcoin and is being spearheaded by a major personality in the community... much like Dogecoin's Jamacian Bobsled Team fund raiser.
In general, Bitcoin and Dogecoin are probably less useful for fundraising at this point than simply soliciting door-to-door.

You have no bitcoins until ChangeTip agrees to allocate some to your external address on the Bitcoin blockchain.  All you have is some numbers in a private database.


This isn't (necessarily) so sinister, actually.  If you want to dominate the future market, it helps to build a large userbase.  Since it isn't particularly expensive to support the ChangeTip system, a fairly long 'no fee' period at the start isn't a bad way to get one.
Of course, it could just be to get a large userbase so a lot of bitcoin is under a ChangeTip-controlled bitcoin address on the blockchain, and while everyone's happily tipping around within the ChangeTip off-chain accounting system they get 'hacked' and close up shop.  That has been a distressingly common Bitcoin 'business model'.

You 'own' an address by having both the private and public keys, correct?
Wouldn't it be much easier to have a minimum delay between transactions (I really don't care if I can only make 1 transaction per 15 second interval, and that gives us a *lot* of slack in ms to agree on a time), then have both the sending and receiving address agree on the time?
Like this:
* Address 1 contacts Address 2 (yes, both have to be online and communicate with each other).  The contact attempt is encrypted with Address 1's private key to prove identity.
* Address 1 sends a timestamp.
* Address 2, if it agrees on the time, responds with a timestamp.  It encrypts the timestamp with its private key, so Address 1 can't fake it.  The entire response is *also* encrypted with Address 2's private key, so nobody can impersonate Address 2.
* Address 1 publishes the transaction, encrypted with its private key, containing the timestamp from Address 2 (still encrypted with Address 2's private key).
Now anybody can see that both addresses agreed on the time of the transaction.  The only way to fake it is to control both addresses, in which case you're only sending funds to yourself.  Anyone else will check the blockchain for your recent transactions and can determine if you have sufficient funds or not.
The network would accept any transaction as valid if 15 seconds pass without a double-spend, and discard any transaction that appears to come from 15 seconds or more in the future... and everyone's checking the time.  If you let your system fall out of sync with the clock, you'd be unable to particpate.
15 seconds is a reasonable time to wait, even in line at the coffee shop.  That's approximately how long I stand there with my credit/debit card or even getting change for cash.

Scarcity alone isn't worth anything.  You need demand to outstrip supply - without the demand, how limited the supply happens to be is irrelevant.
For instance, I have an extremely limited production run of "Navel lint of The_Evil_Within", but nobody's trying to collect and hoard it.

China can only kill bitcoin in China.
If Chinese-induced instability kills bitcoin, it wasn't much of a technical acheivement to begin with.
I think having daytrading speculation (by far) more responsible for setting bitcoin value over day to day commerce is more likely to stall and possibly kill cryptocurrency.  It should be the other way around to stabilize values.

Bits are misguided, in my opinion.  I didn't really follow the discussion, but I assume it was to facilitate use as a tipping currency.  It doesn't work.
However, 'revaluing' bitcoin by using a metric prefix to bring the average purchase into the single digit range and to the left of the decimal isn't a bad idea.
People are generally more comfortable with that, and any barrier you can remove should be removed.  This makes a 'bit' equivalent to 'µBTC', which at current rates makes 25 bits to the cent.  That's too low, and we really should have simply shifted to using mBTC as the base unit.
That'd put 1 mBTC at around 40 cents.   In the same range as the USD, which makes it easier for people to get a handle on the value.
Still doesn't solve the problem of Bitcoin being unable to handle micropayments without an off-chain 3rd party processor.
TL;DR - BTC as a base is fine for traders, not so good for general commerce.

In eBay's case... they could make a secondary killing buying bitcoin from exchanges and selling it to eBay customers to use as a payment method.
1. Buy BTC
2. Allow BTC payment option
3. Sell BTC to buyer
4. Buyer uses BTC in transaction with seller
5. Seller either keeps BTC or sells it back to eBay
I see at least two spots in there where eBay could skim a percentage, and it's not like you could be held hostage - you could use your own bitcoin to buy and keep the bitcoin you get from selling.

Over time, it will become obvious that wire transfer is the same as agreeing to be mugged - both by the bank or wire company and your government.  Some cryptocurrency - maybe not Bitcoin - will make this obvious because it will have taken over the business.
It will also hurt credit card use, since it comes without a 3% merchant fee and costs mere hundreds to implement a simple PoS terminal.  With merchants putting in more and more payment terminals, there will be more and more desire by the public to use crypto as a sort of multi-vendor gift card.
After a while, a critical threshold will be hit.  Remember when businesses thought you had to have a Yellow Pages ad, and having a web site was a joke or a gimmick?  That same transition will happen again - crypto will be a standard business practice instead of a gimmick.  At this point, many will stop doing direct exchange to fiat and just hold bitcoin.
With a fixed supply of Bitcoin (ever dwindling as some are permanently lost - a fault of Bitcoin, IMHO), as more users adopt it and want coin, the price must go up.  This last point is why I think Bitcoin might actually be doomed to be replaced by a next-gen crypto.

Heh.  This made me think about common wallet software - it isn't quite there yet.
For instance:
* My wallet has no way of showing separate balances on a per-address basis, it just assumes you want them all lumped together.
* There's no simple way of setting up an n-of-m address with another wallet.
* There's no way of attaching a wallet-based (as opposed to address-based) proof of identity to a transaction.
* There's no DNS-equivalent to make an address easily communicable by a human (and no, manually using Namecoin doesn't count)
* There's no function for printing out my backup data, nor for manually entering it in if there was (the old 'store it on paper in a safe' backup method).
* Mixing for anonymity isn't configured as standard, with a simple option to disable when desired.
Put all those things in a multi-platform wallet app, and I think you'd have a much easier time getting non-techies to 'join up'.

I have trouble sympathizing.  I've only been playing with bitcoin and dogecoin for a couple of months, I only have a balance of around $10... yet I know enough to move everything into addresses under my direct control.
A cryptocoin exchange offers you *zero* security while reducing your control, and shouldn't be used as if it were a bank.  If you're not actively trading something, you get it out of the exchange.
People who put everything into the exchange for storage are people who are playing with something they obviously don't understand well enough.

No... I'm offering it as one example.  Dogecoin is weak, but it isn't dying yet.  It is more suited to micropayments, and may end up surviving on that alone.

Banks are tiered, Bitcoin should tier.
A clearing 'overchain' to handle transactions between regional chains, regional chains split into high-value/high security/low speed and low value/moderate security/high speed.
The same BTC throughout, but you only track within the sub-chains until they cross over, at which point the sub-chain records a tx to the clearing chain, which records a tx to the destination sub-chain.

Right, but you can say that coins moved from a known address to an unknown, and when.  You can then look at MtGOX records and remove legitimate transfers from that list and find the addresses connected to illegitimate transfers.
If you really want to, you just follow the flow from address to address until a transaction happens where real world identity is verified - it doesn't matter if it's a legal transaction or not.  You now have a human being you can grab and interrogate.

It doesn't matter if they're rip-offs, if they solve a problem Bitcoin won't. Switching is easy since the infrastructure is identical and in place.  There's next to no cost to the effort, not even inertial since Bitcoin's market penetration is tiny compared to the actual marketplace.
But hey, don't worry about transaction times, blockchain bloat, deflation being a problem and not a solution, non-reversible transactions being good for vendors but bad for consumers, etc, etc, etc.

Guessing how long that'll take and the value of a bitcoin by the time you're done collecting I'll leave up to you.

When you're only minimally invested in bitcoin as an interesting technology... there are plenty of different kinds of obsessive people here you have to ignore.

If you walk away with enough money to live off for the rest of your life, do you really care if a small percentage of the geek population hold a grudge?
Of course, you have to manage the 'walk away' part, which is definitely easier if nobody even suspects you in the first place.  Mark's going to be hounded for a *long* time, and probably for as long as bitcoin exists, somebody's going to be looking for coins leaving a MtGOX storage address.

I don't know - but I'd have to guess that the MtGox thing followed by the malleability thing led to a drastic drop which spooked a lot of casual investors into thinking Bitcoin has no future and made them want to bail.
I'd be more interested in knowing why I get different values with CaVirtEx and Coinmill - by a difference of over $CAD 100.  You'd think significant variances between exchanges would be nearly instantly leveled by cross-exchange traders.

Price instability is not a selling point.  Consumers (and vendors) want a stable currency so they can have some ability to predict how much things will cost compared to how much they can earn and how much they have on hand.
Stability across periods of years (even if it's a stable increase or decrease) are required.

I'm not a True Believer, but I'm a believer.  I think worse things could happen to the world economy than a common electronic currency that doesn't need banks.
Without international currency barriers, you'd see a world economy equalizing like never before.  Short term, it's worse than free trade at destabilizing employment in well-off nations - governments will no longer be able to exert anywhere near as much control on the movement of wealth.  Taxation will become... interesting.
Long term, though, it's a huge leap forward for all mankind.

I don't.  I pretty much look at Bitcoin as e-Cash for web purchases until such time as bricks &amp; mortar stores start supporting it.
It's like a gift card that's a pain in the ass to charge up, but fairly easy to use.
OK.  Here's the service.  Sell BTC gift cards.  
Difficulty: They need to be available next to a Wal-Mart cash register, and when I buy a $20 card it needs $20 worth of BTC based on a live exchange rate... which means the sale needs to be registered somehow so the address is filled with the appropriate amount at the time of purchase.  
And the spread for Wal-Mart's profit should be in the 1% range.

The best theory I've read today is that people are dumping BTC in preparation to invest in the Alibaba IPO, which has the potential for much higher short term profits.
If this is true, the price should stablize just prior to the IPO, and recover after Alibaba shares skyrocket and people start to cash out and return to Bitcoin.
I have my doubts that Bitcoin is big enough that every potential Alibaba investor has BTC holdings and is dumping them for cash, but I haven't seen a better guess today.

It's an interesting problem - but I don't see how it would be terribly difficult to have a credit card that worked in XBT, with the merchant requesting payment from a bank in XBT against your account.  
Fundamentally, it's no different from a merchant requesting payment from a bank in fiat against your account.  It probably wouldn't take the credit card companies very long to adapt if they wanted to - after all, you can already get a card that operates on foreign currency if you wish.  What's XBT to a bank other than a different exhange rate?
In the end, crypto or fiat, to a bank it's just numbers and labels.

I think we ought to be focusing on changing the attitudes of the unfriendly.  If your first experience with Bitcoin leads you here... it's easy to be driven away.  Contrast that with (not that I'm all that keen on a subreddit that's almost completely memes and silliness).  You show up there, and it's all hugs and kisses.  
I think that's because a lot of people here are either True Believers or daytrade addicts.  If you say anything that affects their sacred baby, they get angry and attack.  That's really not healthy, and it's actually counter-productive in the long run.
Sure, somebody might come here and ask a question or make a statement that causes some people to doubt the future of Bitcoin more than they otherwise would have... but they're also part of the future of Bitcoin themselves, and censoring them or otherwise driving them out can only hurt us.

Not necessarily a bad idea, and I don't want to seem ungrateful, but changetip seems to have a few issues.
First, a satoshi is a base unit of bitcoin - 1 BTC = 100,000,000 Satoshis.  There's no way for 50000 satoshis to turn into 0.1 mBTC without a really bad math error or an 80% fee by the tipping mechanism.
Second, the resulting 0.1mBTC shows up on the changetip.com website as 1/10th the minimum withdrawl amount, so it's effectively stuck there and inaccessible to me (except, presumably, within the changetip system).

It depends on your definition of 'worth it'.  If you're doing it for fun, to support bitcoin, or just to fiddle with the process as a learning exercise, then yes, it's worth it.  Maybe to turn a bit of electricity into cryptocurrency at a loss so you have some 'magic Internet money'.

Make it illegal to use cryptocurrency in commercial transactions.  They can't stop it for black market use, but if you're suddenly unable to use it for normal purchases, or get it from an exchange, etc, it becomes less attractive.
The other option I see is for a government to issue its own crypto, 100% pre-mined, hooked to a central bank that controls the release of new coin and runs all the nodes.  Sure, would have fits, but the average person would just have a different kind of plastic card in their wallet and not really care otherwise.  Under this method, the government could actually do away with the current tax system and replace it all with a small transaction tax... that might or might not be an attractive selling point, depending on how high that number would have to be.

So long as your losses converting fiat to bitcoin and back again aren't more than 3%, yes.
It's kind of a bootstrapping issue.  If we all dealt in bitcoin, there'd be no issue at all, but for the overwhelming majority you still need to do most things in fiat, so there are going to be conversion fees.

0% - Bitcoin doesn't allow you to carry a negative balance for 30 days without interest, or longer with.  Bitcoin isn't (by itself) a short term loan solution.  It also doesn't do consumer transaction insurance, overseen by a central authority that can cut off a misbehaving merchant or ruin an individual's credit rating.
As a *cash* equivalent that doesn't see borders, I think bitcoin has a much better chance of success.

Bitcoin is non-recoverable.  If you lose your private key, it's gone forever.  The flip side is that short of having the entire network agree to change how the system works, there's no way for the network to decide that value assigned to an address should be redistributed.


Convert, yes.  Safely store... no.  Bitcoin is not a sure thing to take off in the first place, and even if it does it might no longer exist in 20 years.
Assuming the funds themselves are legal and not subject to court seizure... you should talk to your lawyer about putting them into a low-risk investment, ideally with a small ongoing payout amounting to whatever you might be permitted access to for improving your quality of life while incarcerated, plus a bit more for the occasional legal assistance with appeals and parole hearings.

Perhaps my financial education is lacking... but you can offer someone your stock in return for goods or services, right?  To me, that makes it a currency, though it's probably more akin to barter.
That's what I meant about Bitcoin - if it never moves, nobody will be set up to accept it, which will obliterate its value.  It only has value so long as that value is recognized, which requires it to be moved about.  To me, whether the dictionary definition matches or not, that's a currency... a store of value that is traded for goods or services.

If everyone does this, then BTC is inherently worthless and eventually the bubble will pop and you'll have nothing.  Like Beanie Babies - "Let's collect them because they're worth so much money" except it turns out they were only worth so much because so many were doing it for exactly the same reason.
Wider adoption by merchants and consumers means that rather than being a pure speculation vehicle, bitcoin becomes useful as a direct currency replacement.
Sure, in the short term merchants cash out as quickly as possible and you're just adding in two unnecessary steps in the merchant-consumer transaction... but once a critical mass of adoption is hit you won't need the consumer fiat-BTC and merchant BTC-fiat steps anymore.

Bitcoin and similar alternative currencies look very promising... but it's still fragile and adoption as a common form of currency could be permanently killed at any time by any number of causes.
If it wasn't risky, there would be no (potential) reward.
However, if you invest too heavily in the future of Bitcoin, you could see yourself losing everything while the older generation still has their savings.  Are you really going to blame them for being conservative when they don't have as much time to rebuild their net worth if they lose it all?

Despite the downvotes and the handy 'lol' you ended with to let us know your post was a troll, this is actually true.
I think the majority of Bitcoin traffic right now is probably market speculation and early adopters playing around 'tipping' each other.
It doesn't matter - there are now places other than Silk Road to spend Bitcoin, and multiple places to go to trade cash for BTC and back again.
It *might* burn out and fail, but I think it's more likely that successful merchants will inspire others to try it, and it'll take off.
It wasn't so long ago that you couldn't use a debit card at a retail POS, now it's almost unheard of not to have the option. Bitcoin could easily do the same.

Those are very valuable posts - assuming company 'xyz' is a company of significant size or is representative of a large number of similar small companies doing the same thing.
Vendor adoption is key to BTC being something more than an unstable investment.  Without it, we're all just trading BTC to each other for shits and giggles while imaging we're millionaires.

Apple and DSW's values can be estimated by looking at last quarter's sales, their production capacity, their physical assets, and the value of any contracts they have with vendors.
Twitter and Facebook can be valued by the number of active users they have, the number of news outlets referring to them in articles, and how much advertisers are willing to pay for ads served up to their users.  This is a little less stable, but there is still *something*.
Gold has a measurable demand and a known supply.
All these things can be used to calculate a value and compare that to the stock and see if it is currently over or under valued.
What can you measure with bitcoin that isn't pure speculation?  So many of the transactions are day trader stuff... so much of the vendor adoption is a gimmick where BTC-&gt;fiat as soon as you've bought their product.
I'd have to say BTC looks most like Twitter or Facebook - their value is found almost 100% in their perceived value.

Because it needs to be competitive with exchanges. 10% makes deposit and transaction fees for most exchanges look much more attractive.

They don't really bother much with makeup, except to really cake on the mascara.  
Hell, the number of times I've seen girls take their shoes off and have filthy feet... thank god I'm not a foot fetishist.
Anyway, perfect appearance is apparently rarely a goal of porn production.

I don't know about that - I guess it depends on how many of the 87k+ subscribers here are both owners of BTC and easily-led 'sheep'.
It's possible that the right rumour here could have a noticeable effect on the price of a bitcoin.  Mostly, though, I'd expect it would have to capitalize on existing legitimate news in an attempt to exacerbate or moderate its effect.

This is completely wrong.  Which is odd, because people usually make the *opposite* mistake, of thinking kids are less intelligent than adults.
**The average kid is just as smart as the average adult.  Not smarter.  Not dumber.  *The same*.**
What they have a deficit in is education and experience - and how much will vary greatly by subject and the kid in question.  Sometimes in a particular area they will have more education and experience than an adult, though usually they will still lack the perspective required to judge that, or the relative importance of their knowledge to everything else that adults have to know or deal with.

I don't think a single day is really enough to judge, but it looks like you might be right - the average purchaser seems to think a Bitcoin is worth $600+ even after the China thingy.

Too many women playing too many games - which was a cultural strategy that worked while they were social inferiors and were under pressure to do what made their men happy.
Now that women are more or less social equals to men, men have less control over their lives because women can be independent if they wish or need to be.  
I think that's a good thing, and that previous generations had it very, very wrong... but I think it's going to take a couple more generations before society's typical gender roles sort themselves out into anything that makes a long term relationship (and all the compromising involved) make sense to anyone not under the influence of infatuation.

At $75/hr, I'd honestly never have bothered to get married.  I could just hang around with friends for socializing and have an escort come over once or twice a week.  The ultimate minimal-restrictions lifestyle.
I've already calculated that a live-in housekeeper is less expensive than supporting a non-working wife.  Basically the money you pay them is what you'd be allocating to your wife for a car (and related expenses) plus food, insurance, clothing, and gifts.  And zero hassle arguing about who is going to cook, clean, and get groceries.
Of course, that all goes out the window if your spouse works or if you want to raise kids in a cohesive family unit.

Certainly a problem - if the value goes up too quickly, nobody spends and we're all fooling each other in a big pyramid scheme.
If you spend to encourage the market, you lose your investment income.

If I understand correctly, this requires you to give your Bitcoin to Coinbase, and trust them to administer it per your direction.
I would prefer a client-based solution that doesn't require a middle-man.

Because we lack the economic might to manipulate investments, we lack the inside knowledge and expertise to accurately assess the risks and potential rewards, and we lack the connections to politicians to ensure the most favorable conditions possible.
A small time investor can never beat a bank.

Major governments declaring it illegal to use for transactions.  As in "it's equivalent to barter because we can't trace it for taxation purposes, so we're banning it".
Banks creating their own equivalent with lower security (as in financial security, not crypto) and minimal fees - this would give them more or less instant mass adoption that Bitcoin simply doesn't have access to.
A few big news items about retired folks losing it all on Bitcoin investments during periods of market instability.

Maybe Canadian taxes are easier... but pretty much I have to deal with property tax (municipal) and sales tax (handled by the merchant) and income tax (provincial and federal more or less combined).
If I make money on Bitcoin ownership, it's either reportable interest or reportable capital gains for my combined federal and provincial income tax... if the amount goes over the reporting threshold.
Of course, the government does not yet have a good method for tracking my BitCoin wallet, so they can't really *find* the gains to ensure compliance with tax policy.

Nah.  It'd be an apocalypse to be sure, but there would be people uninterested in it, or able to use it as a short-term entertainment.

I find a single local printer to be fairly easy, except for wear &amp; tear.
It's when you have a network print server and policies to assign the correct printer that things start to go to shit.

$300 is the rate for a pretty decent prostitute in Canada, and near top-shelf if you happen to be in the Montreal area. (US &amp; CAN dollars are near enough to parity that conversion isn't necessary)
Anything under $200 and you have a risk (but not a certainty) of bait &amp; switch or other scams.
It'll be interesting to see what happens next year when all the anti-prostitution laws (prostitution itself has always been legal, but solicitation, bawdy houses, living off the avails, etc are illegal) are finally removed, if our Christian Fundie government can't manage to pass replacement laws that don't violate the Constitution.  Prices should drop further once there's no risk of jail time.

I think feminism was necessary and fought a just battle... but the visible parts of it today are offensive to me because they're no longer a demand for equality but about putting men down.
I don't think feminism screwed women over, I just think we don't have a culture that has yet figured out how to truly treat women as equals - and I mean that for both women AND men.  We'll figure it out, it just needs another generation or two.
For one thing, we really have to learn to accept that 'equal' refers to legal rights and treatment as human beings, and doesn't mean that women should be treated as exactly the same as men.  We're fairly different with some significant overlap on the Bell curves of the two sexes.

This problem was solved prior to 212 BC - you should read the very famous story of Archimedes.   
The density of gold is known, and a jeweler usually has some pretty good scales.  All you need is a graduated cylinder and a tray to catch the overflow, then do some calculations.

It's not low enough yet.  
Before the recent spike it was in the 200 range, right?  Now that the cause of the spike has disappeared, I'd expect it to return to somewhere around there... or it's still a 'bubble' caused by speculation and incredibly vulnerable to easily spooked 'get rich quick' type investors.
Once it's around 200, I'll probably buy some coins just for fun.  Any higher, and I'd have to have a reason to believe there's a huge spike coming again.

The thing that made Bitcoin accessible to me was a free app in BlackBerry World that made a wallet for me. No understanding or learning required.
The thing that made me download it was a Bitcoin tip.
If it's *easy*, you'll get more adopters. If you have to think harder than you would pulling cash out of your pocket, or typing in a PIN for your debit card, it'll never take off.
Now, imagine a big bank made your wallet for you, and had the keys. Not so anonymous, but now you get the bank's debit card system, interest payments, and an institution guaranteeing your deposit against loss. It's not for me, but I can see a bank doing that and monopolizing the BTC/layperson market.
