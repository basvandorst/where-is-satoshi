No, never seen this page before. This is something I remember:  but that was another guy I guess.

sounds plausible
@_date: 2017-10-04 07:23:48
Yes, something like this most probably happened, see Edit3.

Nothing special, I just went through the wallet generation process in electrum.

thanks, changed it!
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:39:22
yep, I saw that. I'm currently checking my computer for trojans but nothing found so far.

Not a collision..same ending here.

Whatever this means, I could save those already

There was only a default_wallet. When closing Electrum, moving the file and opening up electrum, a new seed is created correctly and an empty wallet is opened.

No :( I wouldn't even know how and more importantly why I should do that. 
Edit: Also, how could the wallet pop up in electrum pc wallet? I would probably scan the code with my smartphone.

Malwarebytes did not find anything. I am currently running a full disk scan with Kaspersky.

Wow WTF?? Nice find ... but no way, this is from 2014, I didn't have any Bitcoin back then and I would never expose it online as a QR?! How in hell could I have the same seed??? I really have no idea.

I didn't, read my post

I was sweeping a paper wallet in order to put the funds on my ledger nano S, buy yeah I failed by choosing a "used" instead of a fresh OS.
@_date: 2017-10-03 21:26:39
Yes, I still have the file and I have uploaded it here:
But, please be careful!
No, I swept it alone in my room; Noone to watch and the transaction out happened in the same second as the transaction in (see posted transations).

I'm on my way now but I'm back tomorrow and will do this!
