"thanks to the fools that bought Bitcoin at high prices so we can get rich"...lol

I hope that you realize that in technology the first picture is what is preferred, not the second one. Besides that the picture does not represent at all Bcash vs Bitcoin scaling solutions.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:32:20
The first picture shows horizontal scaling, while the second one shows vertical scaling. Both of them have their use cases, but the main advantage of horizontal scaling is that you do not have to turn the system down to scale, while with vertical in order to add resources to the system you do have to turn it down or reboot it most of the time. With virtualization these days the lines are a little more blury. Regarding the pictures I would say that in reality the solutions are actually reversed than what is shown. With bcash basically you have to scale up your node to handle more transactions.

Not only it does not really make sense, but if we had to do a forced analogy actually Bcash would be the second picture.

Sorry i am not going to read some random book just because someone on the internet tells me that afterwards I will get it. Can you post here for short why ?

What you are describing here is the definition of a ponzi scheme lol.

Is that not that already the case in Bitcoin and BCH? You need to buy ASICs to mine properly
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:19:22
Im not sure what your point is ?
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:31:49
They were saying when it was 18k that it will reach 25k or even 40 by the end of the year and now its almost 12k...so i think they were pretty retarded
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:32:03
the idiots that buy at all time high or over it are the ones that set the increase in price of bitcoin so we can then sell for big profits, so I would encourage them so they buy more and continue the ponzi scheme otherwise it will crash if they leave. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:36:09
What I will do is my business, I want to know why so many people meddle in my business and everyone's business.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:32:21
I have never seen such aggressive friendly advices in my life. 
I dont see anyone posting about on holding Microsoft shares with such passion, and they are a lot less riskier to hold than Bitcoin.

Why do you think that Bitcoin and not one of the altcoins(ethereum, zcash, monero, iota etc) is the future. 
Bitcoin has been out for almost 10 years and it had almost 0  innovation in this time period, while others have been out for far less and making advancements. Why is everyone so optimistic about bitcoin being the chosen one?
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:17:58
Wow this seems hard to understand. I dont care if the advice is correct or not. I want to know why is everyone giving so passionately and aggresive this advice when they sbould have no business with what someone else is doing with their money. Clear ?
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:48:13
What no?
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:01:32
the people you are talking about that you think are spreading the FUD are exactly the people that brought bitcoin to over 10 000$...so I would listen to what they think cause they are the ones that will make or break bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:15:24
I agree with what you are saying...just a little triggered that most people here on reddit do no realize that it is a zero sum game
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:23:09
You do realize this is basically all done with the other buyers money who bought late. Bitcoins changes the life of the few that got in early at the expense of the majority who got in late...hmm that sounds familiar to some sort of scheme...I think it starts with a P

Cult rules upvoted more than 2000 times...nice
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:02:23
I do not see people posting how buying gold or real estate changed their life and everyone upvoting oh yeah nice making profits out of other peoples foolishness.
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:12:19
Why are you thrwoing my actions in the discussion lol...the fact is if something completely the opposite  of what you are predicting happens then you are retarded or maybe even more probably you are just hyping prople to buy even more so you can dump for greater profits
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:18:44
no, he is saying that reddit was retarded with all the upvotes of posts saying that Bitcoin will reach 25 000$ by the end of the year

most people no, but if businesses adopt another crypto because it can actually be used then people that want to use crypto for their day to day lives, which is the end goal I imagine, will have to migrate to that one.

The bad part is that even if it arrives it may not prove to be the holy grail everyone hopes it will be

if someone bought at 19.5 k then it is -30% for the year for him

@_date: 2017-12-19 17:15:17
Hey watch your language. I asked so I get answers not to be pointed to random external resources. Thanks for making a fool of yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:33:27
But why? The only ones that care about if others are selling are the ones with financial stakes in the system right?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:12:03
You do realize that past events do not predict future outcomes right? Otherwise everyone would be rich...

wow commenting on writing by mistake blockchain with capital letters on the fucking internet...you must be a special kind of snowflake(aka retard)
