It's the european debit card system. Everyone has a Maestro card (even if that name usually isn't used), some people have credit cards as well (Visa or MasterCard).
Just reading up on that, it's a lot more complicated than this...

I was about to post the same. It hurts when you read that.

Try bitquick.co, I don't think they wanted a lot of personal info when I bought there.

It used to work. Not sure if it still does though.

The same holds for a stock. (Only that a stock will have a split performed to make the tradable units smaller.)

That's not true - actually, the German government said Bitcoins are "private money" ("privates Geld"). 
They also said Bitcoins are not "electronic money", which seems to be defined as keeping an electronic balance of legal tender, which is not the case since Bitcoins are initially earned through mining. 
In fact, they also said that Bicoins aren't legal tender anywhere, so they're not foreign currencies.
The clarification by the German government was in response to someone asking whether capital gains due to BTC appraisal (upon reconverting to EUR) are subject to the German capital gains tax ("Abgeltungssteuer" / "Kapitalertragssteuer") - they're not! Buying and later reselling Bitcoins in Germany is like buying a rare car or piece of artwork - if you keep it for more than a year, you don't have to pay the 25% Kapitalertragssteuer [edit for clarification: 25% on any gains in value upon realization of that value through selling the item].
