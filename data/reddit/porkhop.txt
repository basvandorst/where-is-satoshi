Blockcypher is displaying base transaction size, i.e. the size of the non-witness part. Sometimes this is because the backend node doesn’t understand Segwit, but in this [case]( the explorer is just using the legacy size for display. The relationship between the “size” figures (in case you’re wondering):
    3(base size) + (total size) = (weight) 
    = 3*138 + 248
    = 662
    (virtual size) = ceil(weight/4)
    = 166

~~That's not a bitcoin address?~~
Edit: P2WSH doesn't use ripemd-160, resulting in longer addresses

I'm not sure why segwit would be needed. The sidechain is funded with an output to a normal P2SH multisig address. Participants in the liquid sidechain are mostly exchanges, who can presumably afford beefy servers and fast uplinks, so capacity should be much greater. Confidential transactions are larger and take longer to verify, but IIRC u/nullc has made some recent progress on this.

Nicely done :)

Interac e-transafer is one of the fiat payment options in Bisq, which is why I bring it up.

How are they different? From the [FAQ](


That sounds exactly like a bank transfer.

I'm guessing it's a Base 58 encoded number without checksum or network ID. You can decode to hex using  "
Bitcoin Address Base58 Decoder" and convert that to WIF using  "Private key to wallet import format".

If you're OK with the command line, you can enter
    plutil -p ~/Library/Preferences/org.bitcoin.Bitcoin-Qt.plist
into the Terminal and look for "strDataDir".

I'm curious what you could accomplish with just a name + burner email address. That's all you need for an interac e-transfer anyway.

The input and output of that tx share a public key hash. You're warm!
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:18:46
No, it only broadcasts recent blocks.

When you open Bitcoin Core for the first time it will ask you where you want to store the blockchain and associated files. By default it's stored under /Users/&lt;yourusername&gt;/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin. With Bitcoin Core closed, you can move this folder anywhere you like. The next time you launch it, just tell the program where you put the folder.

Upvoting for visibility, can't verify right now.

Almost all 256 bits numbers are valid bitcoin private keys - specifically numbers between 1 and 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364140.

Did Bitcoin Core show a balance in your wallet after importing?
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:15:07
It's too soon to make fun of the FUD I guess.
@_date: 2017-08-15 23:57:16
Without more details I can't say. Was it a one-off paper wallet, HD backup? You can use a block explorer to search for transactions to the corresponding public key to see if you spent them all.
It's best to keep your private keys, even if you *think* you don't need them.

Bitcoin qt never had seed words, so maybe you used different wallet software. Maybe you're thinking of Multibit HD? In any case recovery should be possible with the seed phrase.

You're the one bringing this to r/bitcoin. And no the debate isn't relevant - code and hashes have no gender.
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:48:42


That's often the case. Many wallets will encrypt private keys with a passphrase when stored. It's also possible to create coins which can only spent with n of m keys' signatures, or when the preimage to a hash is provided, for example.


Not all wallets provide an easy import/export function. In some cases it's preferable just to send yourself funds between two wallets.


It's happened that online services have been hacked or seized, and the users lost all 'their' bitcoin. You also lose privacy when relying on third party wallet providers. Code on your computer can be verified, and is harder for malicious actors to simply replace with malware. Home users don't typically run network facing services, and may have a lower attack profile.

Nowadays you can set the blocksdir option instead of mucking about with symlinks.

So OP, is the block in question valid or not? If it is, there's no cause for concern.

Probably the easiest thing to do would be to download Electrum and import the seed phrase using the m/0' derivation path.
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:49:25
You can find the basic method by googling, e.g. [Guide1] ( Is there a part of the process you're unsure about?
You could also just broadcast and wait for your tx to confirm on one chain and fee bump it on the other: [Guide2](
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:41:57
This seems likely to have happened.

I have a great idea for a cross-stitch pattern.
