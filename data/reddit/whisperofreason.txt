Thanks for the reply. I didnt know that was a thing, how would you know whether they actually helped speed it up or it happened on its own?

I think 0.001btc. Where does that fit on the grand scale of fees? Am i getting expected results?

Ive been waiting well over 12hours now for a transfer from btcmarkets to binance to get confirmed. I too expected it to be quicker.

I think the fee was around $20aud, he didn't mention anything about having a choice in the fee at the time. I'll be able check with him later on at a more sane hour.

Ah Thankyou, it's reassuring to know the wait for second confirmation won't be like the first. I have no idea how high the fees i paid are, just gotta wait it out i guess.

Whoa I'm waiting on a transaction currently, I had no idea such a wait was possible. I've been waiting 30 something hoursand regretting my choices. I paid 0.001btc fee is that low?

Thanks, i know this now for the future. I'm new to crypto and on the surface btc looked like the most convenient coin as it is most predominant in the markets i was looking at. Not without a downside it seems haha  
But yeah definately should have moved ETH

How long should i expect to wait for my transaction to be confirmed. I sent bought my first bit of bitcoin and got it sent to my account on binance. It has been well over 12hours now and by looking blockchain.info i can see that it is sitting there unconfirmed.  
Binance says i would receive the btc after 2 confirmations. Does that mean i'm in for another 12hours minimum? Will i be able to tell when it gets one confirmation?

I don't even care about the fact that when/if it eventually arrives it will be worth 25% less. But it's a fuckin joke that it is taking this long. I can see where the lack of faith in btc comes from now i have some firsthand experience.

Well, you are doing better than me haha

From btcmarkets and im not sure, my friend bought it with his account and sent it to me. I'm not verified yet so can't convert $ to BTC myself.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:41:16
It's now been over 24 hours and im still waiting for my transaction to be confirmed.. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:35:55
The wait continues. It seems i picked the worst time possible to do this for the first time. I get to watch my money dissipate while i wait for it to arrive. Double the anxiety hahaha
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:31:36
I'm well into my second day waiting for a transaction to be confirmed. Should I be worried about that?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:35:37
0.001 btc tx fee. Is that considered low?
