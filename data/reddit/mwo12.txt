I think 72 hours. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:48:16
Lol. same posts were here yesterday, before yesterday, and everday we see new low. buying now is like catching falloing knifes. Good luck with that.
@_date: 2016-08-02 12:09:42
Here you find some discussion about it:
- 
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:49:44
All this will only hurt regular ppl using Bitcoin. Anyone who wants to cover his/her bitcoin blockchain trail can do it and is already doing this. And if these companies get so good that they can track coins after mixing, for example, those wanting more privacy will just off load their private transactions to anon-coins like Monero or Zcash. Then I wish eliptic and chainanalitcs best off luck tracking those transactions.
@_date: 2016-08-15 23:30:19
And it mines Monero, not Bitcoin. So its nor really relevalt to r/Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:46:44
Yes. btc going down. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:01:22
Bitcoin is not like gold. Even if gold's fiat value was 0, it would still be super useful. Gold has lots of use cases in electronics, chemistry, decorations, metalurgy, jeullery etc, appart from being an finiancial investment.
What bitcoin uses do you see if its price dropped to 0? Whould miners still mine it? would exchanges still trade it? 
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:38:21
I think this would be better handled by smart contracts. Whether by rootstock on top of bitcoin, or other cryptocurrency that supports smart contracts.
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:54:34
so just use decentralized one. no one forces anyone to use centralized exchanges.
@_date: 2016-08-24 10:31:52
Not really. Your new address will have direct link to your real one. Maybe use mixing service better.
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:44:19
There is something like a confidence. And now there is the confidence and believe in btc is going down fast. Noobs that bought at halving expecting moon prices, are waking up to even bigger loses then yesterday. So many investors sell now, either minimising losses, or expecting to buy back cheaper. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 11:50:18
Why would you make it more stealthy? If it was not stealthy enough, it would have not been used in darknet. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 00:09:14
SIGNAIT just added support for Monero : monero7tukbkxn57.onion
So darknet starts slowly recognising problems of pseudo-anonymity of Bitcoin, and discovering that there are better solutions than thrusting and paying third-party mixing services, and hoping that they dont log anything,  wont run with your coins, or you wont end up with "dirtier" coins than your own. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 22:56:07
Dont know how this game works. just now that its being developed. I think in beta now or something.
@_date: 2016-08-20 10:49:04
it might be difficult, as with paypal you can do chargebacks. Not many sellers whats to risk sending you bitcoin, and then you doing chargeback, as there are no chargbacks in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 05:51:14
Past trends are no indication of future trends. Thus it might or might not go back. Will see.
@_date: 2016-08-15 05:42:25
Same like btc, it is only pseudo-anonymous. The momement it gets more popular, you will see rise of litcoin blockchain analytics companies, like you see now for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-10 09:19:21
Only by chash.
@_date: 2016-08-17 23:49:40
Tails, does not have a node, but wallet only. So you interested in running a full Bitcoin node, not a wallet? 
If you want to run full node, just install Bitcoin Core there as you would on any other Linux box, and let it synchronize with network. But getting full blockchain through tor will be very slow. So to avoid this, you can synchronize on non-tor computer, and then just copy the blockchain to Tails or Whonix.  
@_date: 2016-08-01 23:02:59
Nah. the core did not uphold its agreement with chinese miners yesterday. no segwit and no hf, which was promissed to them. So ppl loose confidence.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:39:57
Do what ever you want. Your guess is as good as everyone's else.
@_date: 2016-08-15 23:27:16
Blocks are full now: 
Try later when there is less traffic, or pay higher fee to outbid others for space in blocks.
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:40:11
So he wants to spam blockchain with microtransactions? I'm preparing for Bitheadache instead.
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:15:21
He talks a lot. I'm still waiting for meganet, he said will revolutionize internet. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 12:05:15
You thinking too much. Just relax, and enjoy the ride. btc goes up, then goes down, then goes up and down again, ...
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:45:34
So what happened with his Meganet? He talks a lot, but often it ends in nothing.
@_date: 2016-08-02 11:50:11
ppl who were crazy and bought etc few days ago, can enjoy few times more of btc and eth then now buy selling etc than few days ago. you are crazy buy missing out the boat. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 21:18:32
Haven't it was shown to be a scam?
@_date: 2016-08-15 23:27:28
Blocks are full now: 
Try later when there is less traffic, or pay higher fee to outbid others for space in blocks.
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:55:36
What's the point if no one uses bitcoin for anything. Merchants will have no incentive to support bitcoin, if everyone is just holding, and not spending.
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:34:35
Everyone is doing that.
@_date: 2016-08-22 12:12:04
Yep. for banking eth only. Banks like the fact that you can reverse transactions, if they get hacked or something.
@_date: 2016-08-17 21:24:43
Or just use Tails or run Bitcoin om Whonix Workstation.
But anyway, you know that this will only hide your IP address, not your blockchain trail.
@_date: 2016-08-14 23:30:40
So you dont have to worry. No alt will take over darknet, if its not easily bought and sold by cash only. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 23:01:11
Btc goes up, btc goes down. Nothing to see. move on.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:51:33
So how do you trade without founds on exchanges?
@_date: 2016-08-02 04:15:27
Wonder how low it can go.
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:15:02
Games using real cryptocurrencies already exist or are being developed. For example, 
@_date: 2016-08-11 12:22:50
So you have your answer. Normal fee is not enough. Pay more than recommended. Exactly what I wrote. How you want to get a space in a block with normal fees? Almost all blocks are full now ( I would assume that a person using "bitcoin for years" would know how to actually use bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-08-13 11:47:22
Thats very nice!
@_date: 2016-08-28 11:50:06
What's the point of you post?
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:07:41
Nothing. Not the first time, not the last time.
@_date: 2016-08-21 20:58:42
I seems darknet listened to you. Oasis just integrated Monero: 
and SIGAINT is also on a path for doing the same thing:
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:10:44
Clearly you care by making this thread about falling price. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 12:14:12
That's what happens when you pay not enough fee for your tx. Next time check recommended fees, and make yours higher then recommended. Problem solved. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:57:57
Its not deep, like yesterday 600 was not the dip. More ppl will be waking up, learning about bitfinex hack, press making headlines about this, ppl loose confidence, price go down. Dont need to be super inteligent to see that. 
@_date: 2016-08-18 21:18:05
Maybe your tx has some unconfirmed outputs, thus yout tx is waiting for them? tx id would be useful. 
@_date: 2016-04-05 21:37:26
Any half-intelligent criminal knows how to cover his/her blockchain trail. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 12:30:27
That's how bitcoin works. There is 1MB limit on block size, and you have to outbid others for space in them. And if ppl dont like it, they dont have to use btc. Or they can fork it, change like they want, and go with the forked version. 
@_date: 2016-04-04 21:48:38
He is ceo of Blockstream. He knows what he is doing, unlike some random guy on reddit.
@_date: 2016-04-05 21:39:22
Differences you can find here, if you are so ignorant that you dont understand: 
@_date: 2016-04-05 21:38:40
And to avoiding tax buying drugs and child porn in darknet. That is exactly what bitcoin needs now /s. Get real.
@_date: 2016-04-10 09:13:13
ct masks only amounts, not senders and receiver addresses. So you still will be able to say that A send some btc to B.
@_date: 2016-04-07 01:01:33
I think thats the point of bitcoin, transactions are transferred to every single node. If you want to centralize your transactions to some fraction of it, or move off bitcoin blockchain, than might as well use altcoins or whatever.
@_date: 2016-04-15 07:58:12
If your priority is anonymity, than dont use bitcoin: 
@_date: 2016-04-05 21:37:48
Its not.
@_date: 2016-08-02 05:50:02
Up to you. Some go long, some go short.
@_date: 2016-08-18 08:56:02
How does it relate to Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2016-04-05 21:36:38
Yes, because thats what bitcoin needs now, a label that it is safe haven for tax avoidance.
@_date: 2016-04-17 11:26:32
And how is it going to help? exchanges still know what is your real id, how much you buy or sell through them, and how often. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 01:44:51
Why would he? If he has nothing to hide in his transactions, no reason to be anonymous.
@_date: 2016-04-03 13:08:09
Probably your fees are too small. Just wait or pay higher fees in future.
@_date: 2016-04-25 02:31:36
Or maybe this one: 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:04:44
You think ppl who did this, dont know how to cover their btc blockchain trail. They will just sell it for cash, and that's it.
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:03:09
You think mass media or noobs who bought btc before halving expecting moon will care "bitcoin fundamentals" when they learn about bitfinex and this current massive drop?
@_date: 2016-04-06 02:56:07
this is stupid.
@_date: 2016-04-07 01:14:25
And whos going to check it? Its decentralized for a reason, i.e., no single authority monitoring transaction or users.
@_date: 2016-04-05 22:24:23
This is thread about Panama papers, so we talking about millions of dollars hidden for tax avoidance. Such transactions are easy to spot.

@_date: 2016-04-30 14:08:01
Who decides on which tx are spam or which are not? MIners? And what is definition of spam, so that I know how to avoid making those.
@_date: 2016-04-25 02:29:52
I would mind off course. But it seems the OP does not, as pseduo-anonymity is one of the unchangeable key features for him.
@_date: 2016-04-25 01:42:20
CT only hides amounts, not addresses of senders and recipients. So feds can still know you are sending money to silk road 10, but not how much you send.
@_date: 2016-04-22 08:12:40
Just check other comments. you learn that cc charge much less than 1%.
@_date: 2016-04-10 09:16:41
bitcoin is not anonymous, so there is record. gov would just ask your employer to provide them with your address they deposit your bitcoin too. if they payed you in cash, there is no any permanent and public record in any blockchain for everyone to see.
@_date: 2016-04-25 01:43:07
Bitocin is not fungible.
@_date: 2016-04-05 22:36:24
And bitcoin is free, you think? You have exchange fees (fiat&lt;-&gt;btc) for both the shop and users, plus transactions fees. 
@_date: 2016-04-05 10:23:37
@_date: 2016-04-05 10:23:01
you still have to go to exchanges. and we taking about millions of dollars. I doubt every tax avoiding million would go to localbitcoins to  buy milions dolars worth of bitcion.
@_date: 2016-04-04 00:50:08
You age question is missing 35-44.
@_date: 2016-04-25 22:35:23
It should be instant. Other users said they buy instantly with bitcoin on steam, e.g., 
- 
You must be doing something wrong.
@_date: 2016-04-04 22:03:59
And thats why satoshi quoted those web devs and investors in his white paper, and not adam black. Get real.
@_date: 2016-04-25 02:50:48
Not really. Most ppl just dont care about privacy and anonymity. If they did most would not use facebook, google, outlook, etc.
@_date: 2015-12-29 11:01:44
You not really correct about the need of being expert in cryptography. Andresen says ( that satoshis knowlage of ssl was naive, he was not a cryptographer, and there is not much cryptography in bitcoin to begin with. But for sure satoshi was a briliant programmer, but he did not need to have in-depth knowledge of ssl or cryptography to develop bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 11:14:46
this is r/Bitcoin. So probably not. Better trying on bitcointalk.org
@_date: 2015-12-29 10:10:46
Nope. what's need to be done is to make bitcoin anonymous. Now its not anonymous ( so people use mixers to increase anonymity of their transactions.
The best way is to totally eliminate the need for mixers, by adding anonymity to bitcoin.  
@_date: 2015-12-29 09:53:21
In two days this thread will be gone from the front page, and next week forgotten. You think bitmixer cares about idots using their service? Clearly they dont. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 06:00:20
This could only "possible" work, if satoshi contributed or has other open source projects out there.  
@_date: 2015-12-29 09:56:50
You think this will have any effect on them?:-) So cute. If they cared about their reputation, they would return the btc. They know, that any reddit thread wont change anything. Few ppl will be upset for few days, but many more will keep using them anyway. Bitmixer ppl are not stupid. They know what they are doing.
@_date: 2015-12-14 21:24:06
It will be difficult to make something that is not anonymous ( anonymous. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 00:16:36
I dont want to spend it. Why I would spend it if it will be more valuable with time. I prefer to spend fiat instead and keep bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 12:50:24
it just went down by over 10% in few hours. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 12:51:58
yep. And will go down more I think. Ppl spend lots of fiat over christmanst, and idiots giving bitcoins as gifits to ppl who have no idea what to do with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 21:47:52
Or it could be not.
@_date: 2015-12-01 21:23:04
Yes, but its still very tricky to be anonymous with bitcoin, because it is not anonymous ( And tor is not bullet proof solution that does guarantee anonymity. Just recently you had massive attack on tor: 
From Hern and Andersen:


Also there are reports that tor fails to protect you with bitcoin:
@_date: 2015-12-08 21:31:12
Its good start. You can easily experiment with 10$ worth of bitcoins, send it out of exchange to your external address, buy something with it, donate it, change to other crypto, or whatever. And then if you happy with it, you might get another $10 of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-29 10:03:36
They OP already posted what they replied. What else do you want? Apologies and fruit basket form bitcoin laundering service? Are you serious? 
@_date: 2015-12-01 21:29:49


@_date: 2015-12-29 10:04:42
 They know what they are doing. Tomorrow this thread will be gone from the front page, but 30BTC will stay with them for much longer.
@_date: 2015-12-29 09:59:50
I've never used any mixing service, for this reason. You just give your coins to some third party service, hoping that they are "good" and not take your coins. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 11:58:58
Mining bitcoin at the very beginning was very easy. So ultra early can have lots of them. And it is speculated that satoshi has about 1 min biotcoin. But he/she/them havent spent them yet. So 1mil btc is siting in the blockchain unspent at the moment.  
@_date: 2015-12-31 23:03:06
And bitcoin not?
@_date: 2015-12-29 09:49:29
But everyone says bitcoin mixing services, especially, bitmixer are so good. \s 
@_date: 2015-12-29 10:07:46
Not true. The mistake was made only because OP wanted to protect its privacy and anonymity. Bitcoin is not anonymous, thus ppl use services like bitmixer to increase their anonymity. 
Thus, making bitcoin really anonymous, would eliminate such problem as using any third party services for mixing. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 11:48:57
This is probably fake. At this point, does not matter if this was real message anyway. No one is going to believe it, unless signed with private keys of known early bitcoin addresses belonging to satoshi. btw. I'm real satoshi, but lost my keys due to hard drive failure. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 21:45:52
They are idiots. Bitcoin is not anonymous: 
@_date: 2015-12-29 21:42:40
nothing. what do you want to do? China has biggest population, so no surprise they have biggest control of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-09 09:46:38
I think you right.I think satoshi coded first bitcoin him/her self. he/she writes:


last year and a half while coding it, and there were a lot of them.
So he/she/them were working on bitcoin code since early 2007. So theoretical work started probably much earlier before the implementation began, 
@_date: 2015-12-19 11:46:46
use tor, or at least not these vpns: 
@_date: 2015-12-12 00:23:40
Nope. it is pseudo-anonymous:

@_date: 2017-02-15 11:25:26
And whos going to secure this "new" bitcoin without miners with their hashing power? Back to mining with CPUs?
@_date: 2017-02-19 07:50:57
Dont worry, 95% treshold can be lowered. Litecoin already has it at 75%, so next bitcoin core release can set it to even lower.
@_date: 2017-02-07 11:41:39
I wonder if owners of those 57k tx would agree with you. 
@_date: 2016-03-22 23:43:30
And trust third parties to process your transactions and maintain anonymity, e.g., trust them they are not logging the transactions or wont run with your coins?  
@_date: 2016-03-27 23:57:40
@_date: 2017-02-01 21:05:31

For me cash is perfect. I use it for %90 of my day-to-day translation. Cash works without internet, no need of public blockchain, instant confirmations. Not sure you are familiar with such concepts?
@_date: 2016-01-08 23:56:00
This would explain this one: 
@_date: 2016-01-22 01:41:59
Many say, dont put all your eggs into one basket. So having some altcoins can be a good idea.
@_date: 2016-03-01 14:35:16
Just pay more if you want faster confirmation times.
@_date: 2016-03-01 03:22:46
So how do you call all these posts about unconfirmed transactions, if not a bitcoin failure today? Its bitcoin' future or an advantage that you can relax waiting for these confirmations? Only idiots need confirmations anyway, I guess.
@_date: 2016-01-16 00:15:29
Mainly, this happened: 
And this comes from one of the key bitcoin developers.
@_date: 2016-01-24 10:51:05
I usually buy with increments. This results in bicoin price averaging. If you want to buy in bulk, then you will start wondering if bitcoin price will go up, or will go down, etc. You  might end up buying a lot a top price. With price averaging the bitcoin volatility does not annoy so much.
@_date: 2016-01-15 07:03:11
What? So Hearn is right, that blocks are getting full now, and the deadlock is near?
@_date: 2016-01-10 12:38:16
Which he has never touched. Not even when they reached $1200
@_date: 2016-01-10 20:47:15
I woud't be surprised if they were confiscated by feds.
@_date: 2016-01-27 23:35:03
I think it will be quite the opposite. Ppl will start selling bitcoin to recover their lost fiat money. Most still have to pay their rents, mortgages, loans, pay employees, buy groceries with fiat. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 04:35:01
What colored coins? You mean tainted coins?
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:01:52
I think just making threads about this, is exactly what they want.  It's free publicity for etherum. 
@_date: 2016-03-31 22:56:14
What so special about bitocin format, that its need dedicated support in office?
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:45:21
as low as ppl are willing to sell it for.
@_date: 2016-01-15 12:42:26
You cant just change it at will, as bitcoin is distributed. Majority of its users (specifically miners) must agree to support something new. And we have already, at least, four competing solutions to this problem:

you say as if tor did not exist. Everyone will be running it through tor.
@_date: 2016-01-21 17:00:47
Mixers help,  but can't guarantee your anonymity. With mixers you have to trust mixers admins that they do not log information,  for example, or that they don't run with your coins if they decide to. But they should obscure the link between your coins, but probably won't eliminate it completely. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 12:19:55
Then, I'm not sure what is the point of openbazzar now. So its purpose is to trade so that your ISP or feds could see you  are using it?
@_date: 2016-01-19 13:04:49
The guy has no idea what he is writing about. 
@_date: 2016-03-18 01:48:53
Bitcoin should be settlement system 
@_date: 2016-01-16 02:17:47
A blockchain consists of blocks. These blocks contain users transactions. Currently, the maximums size of the block is 1 MB. And its getting pretty close to getting full. 
When this happens, transactions some cant be fit into blocks, and will be waiting for other blocks. Something like this situation:
And then number of unconfirmed transactions will be growing:
Resulting in lots and lots of unconfirmed transactions and angry users.
@_date: 2017-03-15 01:41:45
So start testing and contribute issues and possible solutions to them in code.
@_date: 2016-01-26 09:45:46
In terms of crypto? Nothing. If Bitcoin fails, every other coin will fail as well.

You have the point. If he not interested in money, he could donate it. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 21:21:56
OP wants to buy bitcoin using his id. Thus exchange will know what his address and real identity are. If later this address is found to be linked with some drags later or something, just cross-referencing exchanges could be enough to find the identity, and then go from there following blockchain trail.

Most ppl dont care about ideological principles of being decentralized, free of banks, spying, governments. Ppl just want to be able to pay for stuff and dont worry, that their transaction might not go through, or it will be considered spam.
And if credit cards or paypal do daley or mess up with transaction, you can always call them, make offical complains, etc. And with cryptocurrencies what can you do? Complain on reddit? 
@_date: 2016-01-10 20:51:01
Bitconi is still officially an experimental project: 
So whatever bad happens with it, and ppl start compalining that they lost lots of money on it, the bitcoin devs could just say: it was  an experiment after all, so blame yourself for putting too much fight in an experimental project.

Only if you have password on your wallet and have it backed up somewhere else than phone.
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:04:40
bitcoin was designed from day one so that miners control it, and users follow. If you change the rules, you just made an altcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-16 00:34:10
Satoshi didnt bash bitcoin publicly so that he can get nice paycheck from banksters.

Thank you.

The only way to buying bitcoin anonymous is by cash, without any record on exchanges. Bitcoin is not anonymous ( and if your identity is connected to your bitcoin address, your coins can be tracked.
@_date: 2017-03-25 22:50:41
lol. even if BU support drops to 10%, segwit is not going to be activated. segwit requires 95% support, and if not in november, segwit is gone totally.
@_date: 2016-01-21 00:47:08
Yep, peaty much this. Majority of nodes (specifically those with majority of hashing power) need to agree to support the change.
@_date: 2017-03-25 09:04:28
scared of what?
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:30:21
Miniers are releasing it. that's why they are increasingly supporting bu, to solve the problem of back long and high fees.
@_date: 2016-01-15 07:21:38
have you read bitcoin.org? Bitcoin is only an experimental project. Why ppl dont understand it. 
And as any experiment, it can fail miserably. 
@_date: 2016-03-13 06:23:17
And how much Bitcoin lost from its peak of $1200? If you take a bigger look at bitcion, you would see it dropped in value almost 3 times from its glory days. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:07:10
since when bitcoin consensus is made by signing documents? wasnt bitcoin consencus meant to be achieve by using hash power?
@_date: 2016-01-20 12:34:39
Any translation available?
@_date: 2016-01-04 01:21:15
Nope. Bitcoin will be in blockchain of every node outhere. As long as you have your wallet files you are ok, you can always later download your own copy of blockchain.

Off course its fine. Sell now and buy back more cheaper. This is perfect.
@_date: 2016-03-01 01:24:35
So instead of using bitcoin directly, without any third parties, now we have to use third party services, or visa and mastercard on top of bitcoin? So why not use them now? Whats the point of bitcoin then, if users have to relay on third part solutions/services for their transactions? What's next, bitcoin banks?:-) 
@_date: 2016-01-19 13:03:15
The problem is that general ppl read this stuff. People or reddit knows its bs. News like this only deter new potential users of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-25 04:39:49
miners do act. that's why the increasing support for bu. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 21:56:29
The fact he has to say it was no conspiracy, it suggests that it was actually a conspiracy. And this post is just to remind  press about this bitcoin topic, and keep this discussion going.
@_date: 2016-01-21 03:40:51
Just need to convince majority of hashing power to switch. The best example is Bitcoin classic. The change that bitcon classic wants to introduce is to switch from 1 MB blocks to 2MB blocks. This is a big change, as it is a hard fork. The threshold for bitocin classic to kick in, is 75% of hashing power (i.e. miners) to support it. And it seems it may achieve its goal:
If less than 75% of hashing power supports it, than it wont happen. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 05:57:55
What stop spammer for keeping spamming like this for long time, if these no-fee transactions are good enough to push back transactions with default fees?

good for you. But yet, all that reading and courses did stop you from making pointless threads on Reddit.

it was in private beta. so its hash power was very limited.

@_date: 2016-03-21 23:29:10
Any half-intelligent criminal knows how to cover it tracks with bitcoin. And if the analytics companies  get too good somehow or anonymous bitcoin use gets to difficult, the criminals will just switch to anon-coins such as Dash or Monero. Good luck then to the tracking services.
@_date: 2017-03-26 23:39:41
BU is at all time high, and higher than SW. So Core blocking BU, is leading to price decline. The faster the BU completely takes over, the faster the price recovers.
@_date: 2016-01-03 12:46:08
So according to this, miners and exchanges control bitcoin? So its exactly same as with banks and exchanges controlling fiat? 
@_date: 2016-01-16 00:16:05
Mainly because of this: 
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:07:40
Nope. it was correlated with blocking the bu. the faster bu takes over, the faster the prices will recover.
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:00:13
Double check the address you send btc to is correct. And if yes,  try contacting the Web admits.  But if it is dark net market,  there is also an option you just got scammed.

@_date: 2017-03-25 23:13:46
one cpu - one vote, because before each node coud mine with a push of a button, so that everyone who had a node could easily mine, and cast their vote. Core removed this option, so those who run nodes cannot mine and cast their votes. they have no say anymore. If it was still one cpu - one vote, you could still be able to mine using your bitcoin node. 
if core says uses have any say in bitcoin, why not bring back mining back to nodes, to cpus and gpus, so they everyone can easily votes. they wont do this, because those how just run nodes don't matter. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:31:27
yep, you can leave them and watch what will happen.

The is superior only because people like to put up with all the censorship and stuff theymos is doing. Why theymous would change his moderation policy, if ppl just keep coming back for more drama? 
If people were really upset with theymos they would move, and stop the drama. Then themos can moderate dead subreddit as he wants.
 
@_date: 2016-01-10 12:35:14
There are also ideas that he might be working for nsa, as there are quite a few similarities between bitcoin and nsa reports about currencies form 1990s. Also satoshi used cryptographic methods invented by nsa, rather those commonly used in open source projects at that time. This would explain why he wanted to become anonymous from day 1.

yes, but unlike with etc, ppl will really straggle to use coins on minority chain for one or two months, before difficulty will adjust so that blocks can be mined by a fraction of hashing power.

Bitcoin is a distributed system, with about 6000 nodes currently. A  "bad" change of a single nodes will not do anything. Majority of users would have to agree to upgrade/change their nodes to run the malicious software. That's the beauty of a distributed network. A singe bad actor (even bitcoin devs) cant do anything.
That's why change to 2MB blocks from 1MB is not easy. It requires majority of users on board. And this is difficult to achieve.
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:31:32
bitcoin was never meant to be electronic cash system, only settlement layer /s.

I guess that eth can be "programmed" to do what ever banks want. Bitcoin is very rigid, in which even its devs cant make much changes without a lot of drama.

@_date: 2016-01-21 16:21:52
It's up to sellers in your region.  Some will want cash only,  others bank deposit or PayPal.  It will be written there what do they accept.  But remember that their prices are usually higher than on exchanges.  
@_date: 2016-03-03 02:52:10
Nothing forces to include transactions in a block. So mining empty blocks is cheaper and faster, as you dont need to check nor verify valid of any transactions.

Also, can i buy their newspapes and gums with bitcoin?

Its unlikely your tx will be picked up by any miner in this case. Just wait one more day, and tx will get removed from the mempool. You want lose anything. Then do it again with proper fee. Check what fees provide which confirmation times here:

Blocks are too big anyway and you are just spamming Bitcoin /s. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 15:17:22
Did your tx got confirmed? Maybe its stucked in the mempool and waiting for confirmation?
@_date: 2016-06-26 13:00:18
So what about rootstock? Dont they want to bring smart contracts to bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-06-15 19:24:10
Now? Ppl just should stop making txs, and let current mempool to be process. So tell everyone to stop making txs for few hours, so that mempool goes down.
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:10:37
Or just don't use Bitcoin for few hours,  to reduce pressure on it. 
@_date: 2016-06-13 03:40:36
What? So 1MB is considered as to big now? 
@_date: 2016-06-15 18:06:13
If its get too expensive, ppl will just use something cheaper. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 01:01:21
How they can ensure that no developer will ever write buggy  smart contract? DAO thing is because dao devs made bugy contract and someone used this bug to his/hers advantage. DAo happened not because ethereum is broken or etherum got hacked.

How come bitcoin core after 7 years of development cant get correct fee estimation?

The moment you buy, widrough to your own wallet that you control. If you keep your coins on an exchange, or any other service, coins are not yours unless you have full control of the private keys. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 22:56:40
another lol. you think miners will allow bunch of noobs running nodes on vps for $10/month to threaten their multimilion dollar investments in mining equipment. if UASF will become any real thread rather than just a stupid idea, BU support will skyrocket.
@_date: 2016-06-17 07:19:14
This is the price increase for halving. And if you want, keep catching falling knives. Maybe you will be lucky and wont hurt yourself in this process.
@_date: 2016-06-16 09:05:51
You can check: 
@_date: 2016-06-10 02:19:30
They charge much more than exchanges. But they are more anonymous I guess.
@_date: 2016-06-15 18:02:34

@_date: 2016-06-21 19:37:44
You've been with btc for three years, and still are suprised that after sharp increase comes equally sharp decrease? Are you serious or what?
@_date: 2016-06-25 15:16:37
Oh, just keep ignoring topic of unconfirmed transactions, and take this discussion to some political ones. Good luck with that.
@_date: 2016-06-01 11:33:39
You can try to double spend it. If you make same transactions again (same outputs and everything) but better fee, it will get picked up by miners, and the current one will get invalidated. But double spending is tricky. You have to google it. 
Or just wait. If withing 72h it wont confirm, it will be rejected from the mempool and "returned" to you.

btcmarekts has 0.8% rate if I recall correctly, and 0.22% for trading ltc, eth and dao.
@_date: 2016-06-29 06:34:47
Is buying and selling anonymous? No ID or any verification of your identity required? And how much do they charge more as compared to buying on exchange, e.g. btcmarkets?
@_date: 2016-06-06 14:04:25
lol, 4%! I see ppl like wasting money. And they even dont provide full fees:


@_date: 2016-06-23 03:55:53
Bitcoin will go up,  but be pacient. It this volatility is too stressful for you,  then maybe it was not a good idea to buy btc in the first place. 
@_date: 2016-06-27 09:11:39
You mean that gold is not used? Gold is used in electronic industry, chemistry, julueary, decorations, etc. Even if gold was worthless from financial point of view, it still would be used plenty. 
@_date: 2016-06-30 01:31:03
You mean wait after halving's dump?
@_date: 2016-06-21 02:24:31
Why interesting? What did you expect? Price going up non-stop till halving?

To use it, you need to measure its value some how. Otherwise how would you know that 10 BTC is too much for a cup of coffee?
@_date: 2016-06-04 01:08:13
I think this is good place to start: 
@_date: 2016-06-09 11:04:47
4% is massive. you you like overpaying, than I guess its ok.

Thank you for your valuable insights. /s
@_date: 2016-06-17 07:29:43
Bitcoin reward for mining blocks will get halved: from 25 btc to 12.5. So in theory, if the demands stays same, price of btc must double. Its only in theory. In few weeks we will know, but I think that current increase accounts for the halving already as the price literally doubled in recent weeks. So now the question is: will the price hold, will it keep increasing, or will crash down like in 2013 when bitcoin was $1200?
@_date: 2016-06-07 21:28:16
Why ppl dont use decentralized exchange? So they dont want to use centralize payment system (paypal) but flock to centarlized exchanges? Is it it ironic?
@_date: 2016-06-28 13:59:11
Miners compete for solving blocks. No one can promise you that they will be the ones solving block with your tx. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 12:26:59
 halving is comming, so price will keep increasing till then, as more ppl what to cash in on the halving.
@_date: 2016-06-21 02:22:33
Few posibilites:
- btc price going up, so ppl are holding and virtually no one wants to spend it now. So why support accecpting bitcoin, if ppl dont spend it.
- blocks are full, ppl set improper fees, and they complain about not getting games immedietly to their support. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 17:29:04


Nots its not. Its bunch of whales cashing out and taking profits. They will buy now cheaper, pump the price soon again, sell and profit again. Few week hands wont make any change in price.

Why everone in the world? Its not like everyone in the world is using only Firefox.
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:01:20

The uncertanity is only how high the price will be $1k, $2k.

Off course its worth. Its like a few cents for a transaction. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:05:33
Off course its real.

Few hours or about 1 day now. 
@_date: 2016-06-25 14:45:55
Its strange that after 7 years of bitcoin, the basic thing such  as making a transaction with correct fee would not be a problem, and such threads wouldnt be needed neither.
@_date: 2016-06-23 08:53:08
This is getting boring.  Can't you come up with something new, rather the recycling the same joke? 
@_date: 2016-06-29 07:26:08
4% is a lot, but if they dont require driving license, then maybe its ok for pseudo-anonymity. On exchanges you need to provide more information about yourself.
@_date: 2016-06-12 15:15:09
Scarcity.  Supply of Bitcoin will get chopped by half. If demand stays the same,  price must go up. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 03:55:30
Bitcoin will go up,  but be pacient. It this volatility is too stressful for you,  then maybe it was not a good idea to buy btc in the first place. 
@_date: 2016-06-25 15:02:41
I guess that making Bitcoin transactions with correct fees is more complicated than putting ppl on the moon.
@_date: 2016-06-06 14:19:15
polo is back on line. but anyway, decentralized exchange is the future ( just like decentralized currency. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:02:24
Oh wow. This kind of attitude will definitely help bring new ppl to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 07:58:02

The Bitcoin's white apper is titled: *Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System*, not a *Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Setelment System*. If its setelemnt system, than its not what Bitocin was desined for, thus it wont be Bitcoin. It can share its name and logo, but it wont be Bitcoin as orginaly invisioned by its designer. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 03:11:56
The price already increased in recent weeks. I wouldnt increasing more due to halving as it has already been accounted for in the current rise. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:06:42
Why sell? Keep it, if possible, and soon you will have more than $3800 in bitcoin.

Reward from mining will get halved.  From 25 BTC to 12.5btc per block.  So the mining to be profitable at the same level as now,  price has to double. It's short version. Off course there are other possibilities,  but this one is most optimistic. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 05:11:25
It says:


So off-chain for p2p cash, on-chain for settlement. So its not both on a single blockchain.

OP writes he sent it on 17 of May. So how many **weeks** he has to wait for it to clear up? 
@_date: 2016-06-22 02:26:06
Thank you for your valuble input. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 19:32:57
So keep using it and add to growing mempool. Its even better idea.

Now much more since then.

So ppl need to start using, rather than complaining that rates are not so good. But if you prefere centralize solutions, than I wonder what you even do in r/Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-15 05:22:24
You tx conflicts with other tx:
@_date: 2016-06-23 08:48:29
Because he's an idiot. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 03:59:34
So use decentralised exchange,  except centralised. Isn't it ironic to buy decentralised currency on a centralised exchange? 
@_date: 2016-06-05 07:54:58
So double spending it is your last option it seems. But I'm suprised its still unconfrimed or cancelled. Unconfirmed tx must be removed from mempool, as otherwise mempool would grow for everever. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 02:18:32

I think the problem is with buying btc in Mexico, not in Au.
@_date: 2016-06-30 21:25:12
The client pays fiat equivalent in bitcoin at the time of payment. So it does not matter what bitcoin rate is at the time of payment. The fiat value stays the same.

Not really.

@_date: 2016-06-06 13:58:44
And thats why should use only decentralized exchange.

That btc is over $600.
@_date: 2017-01-24 03:31:19
Why I'm not surprised. 
@_date: 2016-06-25 15:10:01
You can ignore me all you want. It does not change the fact that recently there is more people asking about unconfirmed transactions. You can also ignore them as well, or recommend "trying" using higher fees.
@_date: 2016-06-13 18:44:36
 was designed for this.
@_date: 2016-06-15 17:25:07
How you deal with ppl sending money to you with low fees?
@_date: 2016-06-10 04:43:31
Ppl are cheap and expect btc transactions to be made for free? You pay proper fee and you have no proplem with tx times.

use  or  to convert your monero to bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-15 17:56:20
Ah ok. So Bitcoin shouldnt be recommended to ppl. That will definitely make bitcoin more popular. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 04:39:17
Bitcoin as p2p was working fine for the last 7 years. Dont see a reason to suddenly change it to make into setlement layer, and use some off-chain solution for p2p cash system. Bitcoin was desinged to be p2p electring cash system, and it should stay that way. But probably most ppl on reddit will say Bitcoin white paper is rubbish and satoshi did not know what he was disinging. What and idiot satoshi must have been for wanting bitcoin to be A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.
@_date: 2016-06-22 23:59:53
If everyone holds then bitcoin has no use. No mechant have reason to support and accpet it, as no one is going to spend it. 
@_date: 2017-01-30 10:57:31
just give it a time.
@_date: 2017-01-27 06:47:14
@_date: 2016-06-23 17:31:08
If everyone is supposed to hold Bitcoin as most posters here suggest, rather than spending Bitcoin to buy stuff, there is no reason for merchant to keep supporting Bitcoin payments. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 07:13:38
Just hold it. It will rise again, very soon. And if you worring about 60 pounds, then maybe shouldnt buy bitcoin in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 21:50:30


Since when? 
@_date: 2016-06-15 08:03:38
It does not count spam transactions obviously /s.
@_date: 2016-06-21 18:52:13
No,  they should.  If they do,  then you can forget about any major investment in etherum or smart contracts with the fear if vitalik and friends don't like the contract, they will just void it. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 08:10:17
Why not? 
@_date: 2016-06-23 08:12:53
Bitcoin was designed not to have any middle men.  If you want to stick with middle man,  you don't need Bitcoin in the first place. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 23:19:46
Everyones guess is equally good as yours. So what do iyou think?
@_date: 2016-06-13 18:28:28
Confused about what? Priced dropped? This is crypto currency world. Prices can go up %100 in few days, and go down equally fast. There is nothing to be confused about.
@_date: 2016-06-10 02:21:31
The same with btcmarkets. Only ID requried when you deposit or withdaw in fiat. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 07:07:46
Yep, dumping on the "late comers" always feels good.
@_date: 2016-06-22 23:22:50
Good. More for serious bitcoiners.
@_date: 2017-01-31 10:46:29
yes. Since the OP posted this thread, they mined 4 BU blocks. 
the single SW block must have been some mistake or something accidental.
@_date: 2016-06-15 19:08:10
What about unconfirmed transactions?
@_date: 2016-06-23 03:50:28
It will rise with time. If not today,  then maybe next week or next year ��

Thank you for your valuable insights. /s
@_date: 2016-06-10 04:34:32
And ppl still use centralized eschanges. Isn't ironic to use centralized exchanges to buy decentralzied currency?

And if not? 
@_date: 2016-06-23 03:55:37
Bitcoin will go up,  but be pacient. It this volatility is too stressful for you,  then maybe it was not a good idea to buy btc in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 00:08:46
Its not going to be activated anytime soon. There are too many miners against it.

You loosing money only if you bought above current price.
@_date: 2016-06-05 21:40:30
Many things happen with bitcoin. Bitcoin afterall, is [still experymental project]( So need to be aware of this.
@_date: 2016-06-27 08:55:07
If everyone is just hodling bitcoin, and not spending it on anything, then whats the point of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2016-06-17 07:12:06
You must be new to bitcoin and crypto world, arent you? 
@_date: 2016-06-15 19:35:01
Market does not care, as the price is driven by speculation on exchanges. And buying and selling on exchanges is not done on blockchain, but on exchenge's own centralised databases.
@_date: 2016-06-14 14:10:04
Price will go go down if ppl just sell.  Don't do it. 
@_date: 2016-06-25 07:29:08
So you have to wait. Bitcoin transactions take time. There are not immediate.  Or just wait for less traffic on Bitcoin network. Sending tx during "rush hours" can take some time. 
As you can read below, in Bitcoin there is no way to garantee timely transaction times:
You can only "try" sending txs with higher fees, hoping it will get processes faster.
@_date: 2016-06-25 14:47:17
If you get majority of miners to support a fork to reclaim your coins, then you will get your coins back. Making this thread is a good start to reach bitcoin miners.
@_date: 2016-06-10 20:18:51
Because it's not easy to get rich. Past trends don't say anything about future trends.  But yet, ppl like such plots as it seems. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 03:57:52
Why would eth keep dropping? It dropped,  reached bottom,  and rebounded. Nothing unusual. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 21:18:00
Yes, its so amazing that so that ever inceasing number of miners oppose it /s
@_date: 2016-11-08 06:19:46
Yep. Possible. Neverdless, ViaBTC has enough hashing power to block SW for now. With or without this swing, they decide on future of SW. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 23:35:15
And how you know it will go back to its previous level or stay at this level? 
@_date: 2016-11-07 06:47:05
Because there is no shorting of idiots folloing for them.
@_date: 2016-11-03 23:48:55
Experience. Just wait for Europe to wake up to this "news" about China. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 23:49:49
So hold. Your decision. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 22:01:33
You want see SW anytime soon. If you want to help, start mining it yourself. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 23:06:14
Sell, and buy back more cheaper!!!
@_date: 2016-11-08 00:12:39
Its a softwork, so the treshold can be lowered to 80 or 70 or whethever is needed to get it activated with next core update.
@_date: 2016-11-14 21:26:24
Good luck with that. There is too much miniers oposing it. So you wont see segwit anytime soon, if at all.
@_date: 2016-11-08 06:10:27
I was referring to OP's titile. I know they had enough hashing power to block SW, but apparently now, they have even more power to stop SW. It seems some miners just jointed them to vote against SW.
@_date: 2016-11-15 21:30:53
This is the only mention of bitcoin:


@_date: 2016-11-18 04:15:29
Have you checked here: @_date: 2016-11-07 22:48:06
What is the problem with that?
@_date: 2016-11-03 21:35:12
We need more threads like this. they are very useful /s.
@_date: 2016-11-08 03:52:26
If so, then you probably wont see SW anytime soon. There are too many miners opposing it now, as evident by the ViaBTC sudden increase in hashrate. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 02:35:01
Its like saying "Knifes are used by bad ppl to kill others, so having knifes should be banned".
@_date: 2016-02-25 03:23:01
Well, most ppl dont care about it. They care about being able to actually pay for staff, not wait for hours for confirmations, and ask on reddit what is happening.
@_date: 2016-02-04 07:00:31
They will not add it. Do you think regulators and companies working with bitcoin, will like its anonymity? Now bitcoin gets a lot of press that it is used for drugs, and other illegal activities because it is pseudo-anonymous. Imaging what will happen if bitcoin will become truly anonymous. 
@_date: 2016-02-04 02:45:04
There is argument. 2MB blocks would make bitcoin transactions too cheap. Miners want to double dip, get money from rewards and transactions fees:
@_date: 2016-02-24 11:21:06
So at what point it will be just cheaper to use credit cards, paypal or some altcoins?
@_date: 2016-02-02 22:06:10
you mean btc?
@_date: 2016-02-06 08:24:49
its also in the plans:


@_date: 2016-02-24 02:48:45
They want private virtual currency controlled by gov and banks. No thank you.

Bitcoin is not not-anonymous ( but psedo-anonymous. Its rather easy to track, if you dont take precautions. . 
@_date: 2016-02-09 12:23:15
If anyone knew for sure price will go up, they would put all their money into it. The thing is, that no one knows. The bitcoin price was once over $1000. Ppl who bought btc then, lost a lot of money. The current price might be top price for now, and it will decrease. No one knows.  
@_date: 2016-02-03 11:14:16
It should be easy, as bitcoin is not anonymous. Maybe ppl in EU coming out with these ideas should check this: 
@_date: 2016-02-07 23:58:11
How they know what I do with my btc?
@_date: 2016-02-01 11:04:17
Nor bitcoin. So if you dont care about anonymity, using credit cards or banks is fine.
@_date: 2016-02-21 09:35:34
How a regular users know which fee is good? How btc expect mass adoption, if so basic thing is a problem.
@_date: 2016-02-02 04:19:39
How should that matter for confirmations?
@_date: 2016-02-25 01:20:24
They cant and that's why bitcoin is not seeing mass adoption. Ppl prefer to pay with paypal or credit card, without worrying they can be waiting hours for confirmations. Creddit cards and paypal just work virtually instantly. Bitcoin more and more is far from instant.
@_date: 2016-02-02 04:52:11
So they will actually use Bitcoin, or just some in-house blockchain-based currency or some other shit like this?
@_date: 2016-02-24 11:16:03
Most people do, thus you still dont see mass adaptation of bitcion by regular ppl.
@_date: 2016-02-08 08:04:49
if they know your public address, they can always send bitcoins to it. I dont think you can reject any incoming transactions.
@_date: 2016-02-21 09:34:14
how a regular user should now the "correct" transaction fee? 
@_date: 2016-02-03 11:15:00
What about anonymity of cash? 
@_date: 2016-02-29 21:29:40
If you buy with credid card probably not. Must remember that bitcoin is not anonymous: 
@_date: 2016-02-04 02:36:56
And also, there are plenty of bots out there, which will react instantly to any price changes. Often the order books are not very stable because of this. If the price of bitcoin falls close to large buy walls, the walls often shift a bit lower.
@_date: 2016-02-04 02:55:19
They believe in bitcoin code and blockchain. They want to "expanding the bitcoin code base for commercial use", buy building new blockchains and sidechains. Whoever put $55 to blockstream is not so much interested in the bitcoin it self, but in bitcoin code and new blockchains build from it for commercial use.

Nodes are not that important. What counts more is to see if there are any mined classic blocks. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 08:25:47
Nope, its not. Master nodes also do the mixings, so you need to trust a third party to do the mixing for you. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 00:02:45
They dont care. You are guilty by default, unless you prove them you didnt do it. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 11:09:18
Nothing. And anyone can try that.
@_date: 2016-02-25 21:27:55
Its not: 
@_date: 2016-09-03 11:44:55
Before you transfer anything, you should check if (i) there are any space in blocks, and (ii) what are recommended fees. 
If you checked the first thing ( you would know that last few blocks were full. So you need to outbid others for space in the blocks. For this, check the current recommeded fee ( and make it higher.  
Problem solved!
@_date: 2016-09-19 23:36:59
That's what you get for using third parties when transacting in bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-09-21 03:30:01

It is not and it was never ment to be anonymous: 
@_date: 2016-09-21 00:17:03
Why there have to be a reason? 
@_date: 2016-09-26 04:55:33
If you installed tor on your pc, you already doing it wrong. Using Tails or Whonix, for accessing Tor. Tails has build in bitcoin wallet already. Whonix, dont remember if it has wallet or not. 
Bitcoin is not anonymous ( thus never buy/sell bitcoin via any service which can identify you or your IP or credit card number, like exchange or something. Only use cash. Some services in darknet already accept Monero, which is more anonymous than bitcoin, though more difficult to get by cash.
Setup coinjoint for mixing. Dont use third party mixers, unless you trust them they dont log anything or wont run with your coins.
@_date: 2016-09-21 23:15:29
@_date: 2016-09-09 14:28:21
I think OP does not understand the difference between a blockchain and Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-26 08:41:22
How mixers help?  you mixing your bed coins with potentially worse coins.  I would avoid mixers. 
@_date: 2015-09-26 14:02:00
And this is exactly the problem. So 1 btc != 1 btc, because a tainted btc != clean btc. So instead of fixing bitcoin at the protocol level to have it fungible, a user must use some third party service/program to make his/hers bitcons little more fungible. Joinmarket is a poor solution to a much bigger problem. 
@_date: 2015-09-26 01:20:29
So I just have to hope that my bitcoins are 'good'. What if in a future, I cant used them because feds or exchnages will blacklist them?
@_date: 2016-10-20 06:27:34
Mining is done using specialised equipment, like this:  . So you can buy it, run it, but it will cost electricity to run. So need to check how much you are going to pay for electricity consumed by this equipment. If its more than you will get from Bitcoin, than there is no sense to mine. Just buy bitcoin instead.
Since electricity is problem, most mining is done in China. They have lots of cheap electricity, and sometimes even free if they have surplus. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 02:18:31
the article not even mentions bitcoin. so why post it here?
@_date: 2016-10-24 04:43:42
Just buy using cash. forget credit cards or prepaid cards or whatever.
@_date: 2015-09-26 01:35:39
One reason bitcoin is so popular is because it is transparent.  So difficult to hide money laundering.  If you make it private and anonymous,  governments and Feds will do everything to stop it. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 02:22:40
All current blocks are full: 
Need higher fee to get into blocks fast.
Your fee is : 50.29203540 sat/B. As you see here  there are lots of tx with that fee. You should have used higher fee to cut in the line.
@_date: 2016-10-18 21:28:06
Is PIA usa company? If yes, then I pass.
@_date: 2016-10-20 21:13:47
They paid 10s/Byte: 
Which is 10 times less than recommnded fee: 
@_date: 2016-10-23 23:31:08
There was a spike in tx numbers in recent hours: 
Your fee seems way too low, to outbid others for place in the blocks in such situation.
@_date: 2016-10-20 07:19:16
Yes. That's true. But ppl also need to learn how to use it. Setting proper fees,  or at least veryfing a fee set by a wallet, is one of skills needed these days to use Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-10-31 05:09:36
What? 
@_date: 2016-10-25 23:55:12
Rule of thumb:  Double the amount they ( recommend.
@_date: 2016-10-26 02:16:30
I guess you have better solution? 
@_date: 2016-10-20 01:38:34
Because you dont need to wait for any new block block,  validate its transactions, prepare new transactions to be included in your new block, etc. You just immediately start mining on top of a block you just found. So to be literal, mining new block (empty or not) has same time, but because you start a fraction of time earlier, you can find it "faster". 
@_date: 2016-10-26 23:37:06
Buy using cash only, without any third parties involved. You can find sellers on localbitcoin, but dont do selling/buying through their service.
@_date: 2016-10-20 06:20:06
Give your tx id, to see your double-than-recommended tx fee.
@_date: 2016-10-26 21:30:48
No recommendation. Find wallet where you can set fee manually. Go to  to check current recommended fee, and double it to garantee timely processing. 
@_date: 2015-09-26 01:09:57
How do I check if my bitcoins are tainted, and can be rejected by them or others?
@_date: 2016-10-26 23:42:27
You can check here: 
Core is 88% now. So its far from %95, required for SW activation. If nothing changes, you wont see SW anytime soon. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 02:01:54
good luck with that.
@_date: 2016-10-26 02:06:41
So if everyone pays slightly higher fee, does this make all txs to confirm quickly?
@_date: 2016-10-27 00:48:54
Here you can find esitmated processing times of txs with different fees:  Also you find there recommended fee for timely processing. Double it to be safe, and you will never have problems.
@_date: 2016-10-20 05:04:46
After the fact? Setting proper fees is nothing new to have txs processed fast. Its a must thing to do to have tx transferred reliably in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 06:31:53
Yep. You can always mine it as a hobby, but I would not expect any profits. Easier just to buy or earn bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-24 04:41:02
Your tx is confirmed. So it went through to whatever address you send them. Just contact helix support.

Your website is not every good.
@_date: 2016-10-27 00:01:50
Last week you asked same question. The answer is same as before: pay higher fee.
@_date: 2016-10-20 01:31:01
Depends on your fee. If its proper, than no wait. If too small, than have to wait.
@_date: 2016-10-31 21:33:21
No need. Use what works for you best. For many here, Bitcoin is this thing. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 06:12:39
Bitcoin is already successful. Show me any better alternative to bitcoin? And if you know any, why you even bother using bitcoin in the first place?
@_date: 2016-10-26 21:25:12
No solution exists. You can try double spending, but it does not garantee it will work. Need google it. Next time, please pay proper fee or dont use bitcoin during "rush" hours when there is lots txs happening, like now.
@_date: 2016-10-26 02:05:15
There's always a first time.
@_date: 2016-10-22 02:57:44
Its scam. OP's reddit account only exists to shill this "service".
@_date: 2016-10-20 00:41:06


will cause waiting at least 5 blocks for confirmation according to this: 
You should always pay double what they recommend, to be safe.
@_date: 2016-10-24 23:48:15
Its not hight. Recommended fee is 90 satoshis/byte (now). Rule of thumb is to double what  is recommending for timely processing.  So even if 1h ago, recommended fee was 70s, OP (or circle) should have paid 140s. 
@_date: 2016-10-17 11:19:39
Exactly how it is holding its value? Before it was $1200, many ppl bought then, and now is %50 less. Its not holding much for those people.
@_date: 2016-10-20 21:31:47
Isnt Bitcoin the best gift in intself? :-)
@_date: 2015-11-16 00:23:31
Bitcoin is not anonymous ( and there are many ways of tracking your transactions. So there is no surprise that wallets can also be used for this. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 05:08:51
Your fee is 26.95417790 sat/B. The recommended fee is 3x more than this. 
So you have to wait. Ppl who payed correct fee, will be processed before you.
@_date: 2016-10-20 00:03:07
And I'm sure that everyone will just take your word for this, if you real identity pop-up in in their list:

Bitcoin technology, i.e., blockchain, only? Not Bitcoin itself?
@_date: 2015-11-13 12:59:19
If you check here, you find that there are ways of finding the addresses owners. and than you just literally follow the trail in the blockchain: 
@_date: 2016-10-26 05:11:50
There is backlog of tx now. Only tx with high fee get processed fast. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 09:45:30
THis is nonsense. You want to allow bitcoin to "Allowing the protocol to breathe in emergencies"? Why not let it breath all the time? 
@_date: 2016-10-20 06:33:53
Yep. But then when its too expensive, ppl will just move on to something else, or just stick with fiat.
@_date: 2016-10-27 05:03:00
The reason is that there is more txs than space in bitcoin blocks.
@_date: 2016-10-26 04:16:56
And that's why you have unconfirmed txs.  
@_date: 2015-11-12 00:13:16

Because they can mine empty blocks. Why wouldnt they do this? Its faster to mine empty blocks.
@_date: 2016-10-26 23:13:26
There is over 70k unconfirmed tx now. this is what happening. There is not enough place in bitcon blocks for all these txs to be processed in timely manner. 
@_date: 2016-10-10 00:46:42
If you hard on finances, going into bitcoin is not a good idea. Never play with things you cant afford to lose. This is especially relevant to cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2015-11-24 05:15:15
They even do not need to look far for some resources about bitcoin anonymity, e.g.,  
@_date: 2016-10-24 21:16:28
I think OP refers to this: 
@_date: 2016-10-17 11:20:18
and still is. entire darknet is using bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-20 04:16:44
Ridiculous is to make txs, without checking what fees to pay, or how many txs are currently pending. If you did any of these things, you wound not have any problems. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 01:03:42
The problem is if bitcoin is to be regulated or accepted by governments, how do you think they will like full anonymity added to bitcoin? 
Many think that one reason bitcoin can be recognized by governments and regulation, is due to its public nature. Bitcoin is less anonymous than cash (( thus it would be better for feds or any tracking government if ppl stopped using cash (which is truly anonymous) and just started using bitcoin, which in only pseudo-anonymous.
@_date: 2016-10-18 09:01:52
I'm still waiting for his promossed MegaNet.
@_date: 2016-10-26 03:37:54
You paid 52.35602094 sat/B in fee. Current recommended fee is at least double that ( So will wait, untill all those that paid correct fee will be processed.
@_date: 2016-10-27 01:10:48
Recommended fee is here:  Now its 110s/B. Off course if everyone is using this fee, it wont solve anything. Thus, to be safe, pay double of it. 
@_date: 2015-11-13 12:57:56
its not anonymous either: 
@_date: 2016-10-20 21:10:40
Mining pools exists. You join a mining pool, and you contribute your hashing power to them. And then you regulary get btc from a block reward, proportional to your contribution.

If you care about privacy, tor or vpn is only way. But localbitcoin is crap anyway, as they dont care about your privacy. If they did, they would provide a hidden service for its users. Even facebook has onion service, which is ironic. So be careful anyway.

Bitcoin point was never anonymity, but resistance to finanical cencorship. Thus bitcoin is not anonymous ( It is only pseudo-anonymous. 
@_date: 2015-11-25 00:01:18
they were cought. read about [silk road]( for example. The more intelligent ones, know how to cover their tracks with bitcoin. but its not easy. one mistake, and you are done. Bitcoin is not anonymous ( thus using it in a fully anonymous way is tricky. Often requires using some third party services or solutions, for "small" fee off course. 
@_date: 2016-10-19 21:10:20
difficult, but I would worry more about ending up with "dirtier" bitcoins than your own. You may have much more explaning to do when you end up with bitcoins used to buy/sell, for example, CP than when just wanting to have some privacy.
@_date: 2015-11-09 09:49:14
I think you are forgetting about one thing. Namely that your anonymity might not depend only on you. All the steps you described, involve someone else or some external service to you. You might be the most careful person with bitcoin, but what about others you interact with? Each additional step you add to make yourself anonymous with bitcoin is only one more possible point of f**king it up. If not from your side, then from services or friends you are dependent now. You need to factor this in your plans. Bitcoin was never designed to be anonymous ( thus using in a very anonymous way is a challenging task. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 06:18:43

@_date: 2016-10-27 02:37:55

Everyone paying suggesting fee wont make all these txs being processed immediately. You need to break from the line. You do this by paying more than recommended fee. Otherwise, you can waist your time making pointless threads in r/Bitcoin, as if that would speed up tx processing times.
@_date: 2016-10-26 09:46:28
So if everyone increase its fees, this will magically make all tx go fast?

@_date: 2016-10-25 21:06:09

Do it as long as you want your processing times to be fast. If you dont care when your tx get confirmed, no need to do this. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 03:36:17
You should have learned that you need to pay higher fee. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 21:39:44
First thing, you need to realize that bitcoin is not anonymous ( Thus, your transactions will always be recorded in the blockchain, regardless of how many ppl use it. So if someone knows your address, they can look it up in blockchain easily. 
But the more ppl will use it, the more blockchain noise will be generated, making it more difficult for real time analysis. Thus, small transactions will be "lost" in millions of others of similar size. The big transactions, will be rather visible, as they can be spotted in blockchain rather immediately. To back this up, i think the quote from Andresen is well suited here:

Agree. I also think that going for all this trouble without knowing that real satoshi wont come forward (just sign some message, no need for real idenity) and destroy his plans with one line of message, also make me think that Wright knows for sure that real satoshi is not going to do it. This makes Kleiman a strong candidate for satoshi or being in satoshi group.

No one knows if it will go up or down in short term nor long term. So there is not much insight anyone can give you. Only speculations. Some will speculate it will go up, and at the same time some think it will go crashing down. 
The only advice I can give, is to stick around and follow bitcoin news, posts, exchanges, etc, before throwing cash on it, unless you really dont care about this 1000 pounds. In some time, you should be able to make your own decision whether its good investment or not. Who knows, maybe Microsoft or google shares would be better investment? I personally dont know.

Its not fully true. First the guy from the shopping centre can remember you, your face or something. Then he can tell cops that some guy at this time with this bitcoin address got coins in this shopping centre from him. CCVT cameras will do the rest. And your 100 bitcoin are tracked for ever from this point. 
Also, the moment you go spending them on exchange, or buying some stuff with your id or real address, you are linked to that address or addresses originating from it. 
So basically there are many ways of linking your real id with your address. And that its just following the bitcoin trail. Its difficult to be fully anonymous with bitcoin, because bitcoin is not anonymous in the first place ( 
Third, not everyone has access to localcoins. If you are in rural region, or some country outside usa, then it can be difficult to buy bitcoins without exchange. So local coins are far from perfect solution for most bitcoin users.

I dont have many more thoughts on this. The process you are describing seems complex. It might be good from the privacy point of view, but still need to be careful. You can do it 100 times correctly, but one time you do something wrong, and that will be end of your privacy. I can recommend this defcon presentation [Dont fuck it up]( though. Its not specific to bitcoin, but makes very good points about maintaining anonymity through some complex measures for hackers. All these measures introduce new possible points of failure, and off course, as shown in the presentation, ppl do fail a lot because of that.

The story makes sense if Kleiman was the programmer and developer of Bitcoin software and its cryptography use. 
Wright and Kleiman knew each other well. They could be the team Satoshi. Keliman was doing cryptography and programming, and Wright was the spokesmen (the satoshi posting on forums, etc). Kleiman as a programmer and maintainer of Bitcoin software was mining  non-stop probably,and accumulated a lot of bitcoin. Wright might do some mining as well, but not as much as Kleiman.
Kleiman is getting seek, cant really keep program much more and he stops. Wright, without Kleiman, cant keep posting on forums as he lacks expertise in greedy details of the programming and crypto stuff in Bitcoin, so he stops as well. 
Time passes, and Wright goes public now. Why now? Maybe there were other ppl involved (e.g. Hal Finley) who knew the truth. Finley  died in 2014, and finally when all  who know truth are gone, Wright started looking into where are Kleiman's bitcoins. Maybe he hoped to get to them quietly and get into agreement with Kleimans brother, who is supposed to have Kelimans secret usb. The usb can have Kleiman's wallet, but no one has password. So both Kleiman's borther and Wright cant do much. Wright decided to organize super computer for bitocin research (maybe to brute force the wallet password), the plans fail, and/or gets into disagreement with Kleiman's brother. So Wright decides to go public, invents some documents that Kleiman was only keeping the Wright bitcoins for him, so that Kleimans brother is forced by law to hand over the usb and wallet files.

The only coins for sure belonging to satoshi are genesis one,  and the those from block he send to Finley. All other blocks are really speculation who they they belong to. If the coins from any of these two blocks move,  it will prove that Craig is at least holder of satoshi wallet or keys. But they easier is just to sign some message with these keys.  No need to move anything.

It depends how you buy it. Do you need to use your real ID to buy it? Bitcoin is not anonymous ( thus if your real ID is linked to your address, e.g., through exchange, then you are traceable at best by the exchange.

I like the idea that this person (or group of ppl) was from NSA. Apparently NSA or FBI published some report in 90ties, about digital money or something like this with similarities to bitcoin. They new at the time that they had something potentially useful, but nsa would  not allow to make it give it to a public. Thus they published it under a pseudonym. There would be no reason to hide your identity from day one, unless you had known you would get in serious trouble by publishing it. Maybe it was part of some secret nsa project or something like that.

Point 4 is especially important. What if by looking privacy in bitcoin, you end up with btc involved in cp, and be picked up by elliptic company, or any other company tracking illegal transactions in bitcion:

Nope. What if in 1 or 2 years feds requirest your data, because you obtained bitcoins used in illegal activities from someone else? Bitcoin is not anonymous ( and there are companies tracking bitcoins used in, e.g., child pornography. 
- 
So if ever your personal details will be associated with such "dirty" bitcoins, you will have some explaining to do. 
If you want anonymity, never give your details when selling/buying bitcoins. Do it only by cash. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 00:07:51
Exactly. So more ppl like you that just hold bitocin, and not use it, will make bitcoin worthless. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 21:30:35
There is some, but not too much. Bitcoin is psedu-anonymous, not anonymous, and this has some consequences:

Dont know about this bitcoin issue, but this game is being critisizes for requiring a lot of access to private data, for no reason, for example:
- 
So maybe someone find a way to exploit this excessive privacy access of this game.
@_date: 2016-07-17 02:42:58
It will be difficult with bitcoin, as bitcoin is not anonymous, but only pseduo-anonymous.

My vote on btcmarkets.

Unlike bitcoin, gold has lots of use in electronics, chemical industry, jewellery, decorations, etc. Even if gold monetary value is zero, it is still very much useful. 
@_date: 2016-07-27 11:25:44
What do you mean by weeks? Unconfirmed transactions should be "ejected" from mempool after 72h, not weeks.

The last I saw him (3 months ago) was his presentations about smart contracts:
- 
So my guess he still doing smart contract related things.

Just reusing address is not enough for anonymous bitcoin use. There is much more to it than that.
@_date: 2016-07-31 09:30:50
No real reason. Just someone decided to dump, profit and buy back cheaper.
@_date: 2016-07-11 21:09:38
Good on you. That's how btc should be used - to buy things, rather than just hodl and do nothing.
@_date: 2016-05-30 22:02:44
I think you have no idea what you are getting into with trading. So you will just loose money by learing the hard way how trading of cryptocurrencies works. 
@_date: 2016-07-23 23:56:52
What does it do really? 
@_date: 2016-07-11 01:23:37
How it will be used for all these things if ppl just hold? Thats the OP's topic. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 07:43:15
Thank you for your valuable marital story. \s
@_date: 2016-07-07 05:18:34
So dont use Bitcoin, if using proper fee is too complicated. Bitcoin requires ppl to be at least half-intelligent. For idiots there are banks, paypal and credit cards, where they set fees for you, and they dont care you agree or not.
@_date: 2016-07-20 01:26:18
This will hide only your ip, not blockchain trail.
@_date: 2016-07-15 01:08:25
If you have  $800-1000 to invest in mining, just buy bitcoin. Maybe some other currencies are still worth mining with this budget, but I would not have high expectations.
@_date: 2016-07-13 21:13:49
It already double in months leading to halving. What do you expect more?
@_date: 2016-07-13 21:11:29
So dont do anything illegal if you dont want to go to prision. 
@_date: 2016-07-22 01:54:41
Is there a bitcoin minimalist? 
@_date: 2016-07-05 00:43:44
Btc can handle about 3 tx/second. Still no problem with this. And with paying proper fees, you will never have problems with transaction times.
@_date: 2016-07-20 21:21:37
Its about privacy. Bitcoin txs are pseud-anonymous, not anonymous like many think ( One way of increasing your anonymity/privacy with bitcoin is using new addresses for each transaction. 
@_date: 2016-05-23 21:32:10
@_date: 2016-07-05 23:38:59
I know, but  i'm not going to change my plans around bitcoin. If you have nothing better to do, then have a bitcoin party or whatever. 
@_date: 2016-07-20 01:21:03
Bitcoin is not anonymous,  and its rather impossible these days to achieve 100% certainty that your btc transactions wont be tracked to you, or someone you sent your bitcoins, etc.
@_date: 2016-07-17 21:12:38
Oh woow. $20 is nothing. But if that gets you excited, just wait for $200 in 10 minutes.
@_date: 2016-07-17 21:04:00
Just stop being a bitcoin shill. If they want they will use it, if not, then not. What bitcoin needs is more fanboys pushing others to get bitcoin /s. You told them once, and let it sit with them. Dont be a bitcoin shill. 
@_date: 2016-07-20 22:28:06
The more intelligent ones know how to cover their bitcointrails. But not all are that inteligent, e.g.:
- 
@_date: 2016-07-20 01:25:45
This will only hide your IP. Not your blockchain trail.
@_date: 2016-07-06 23:45:41
The btc price already doubled in last 2 or 3 months for the halving. I doubt it will go much higher than it is now. But will see.
@_date: 2016-07-03 10:39:45
Or, just pay higher fees. No problems at all and no need for you guide.
@_date: 2016-07-18 03:32:33
Why do you assume privacy issues are broken? Bitcoin was designed from the very beginning to be pseudo-anonymous, so why ppl are surprised that companies like Elliptic use this "feature" of bitcoin. pseudo-anonymity is one of many other features in bitcion. 
@_date: 2016-07-24 05:11:27
It does not have to. Its enough that it can trace one tx used, e.g., to buy cp, to your wallet which later you use on exchanges. Using mixers poses danger of ending up with much "dirtier" bitcoins than your own. Then good luck explaining it to feds that you had nothing to do with such txs.
