Oh, the class. Yes, I’m well aware there are close to as many atoms in the galaxy as there are bitcoin private keys.

It really isn’t that hard to find private keys that have had coins sent to them but every time the coins have also been removed. Is the source of all these empty addresses the result of concepts like ‘change addresses’ and other underlying functions that result in new addresses by nature of how the protocol behaves?

It is a site that algorithmically generates public keys from private keys and checks the transaction history.

Thanks, I was wondering the same thing!

I was just imagining a world where BTC has a genuinely scalable solution in place but it were optional so bad actors could still leverage the bad path as an attach vector to purposefully slow down the network. It’s comforting to know the protocol would allow miners to avoid the attacks but like you said, it is up to the miner and greedy miners are going to favor a low speed-&gt;high fee environment.

Can miners discriminate against the types of transactions?

What benefit does the network feel if you are not mining or running lightning?

I don’t believe anything you just said is true. Can anyone else comment here? I thought miners needed a fully synced node in order to mine because the mining node is the one that determines if the transactions it is adding to its block are valid according to the history of all previous transactions.

Ok, so the quick and dirty is that you are a discoverable peer that other peers could connect to in order to sync their blockchains? I couldn’t remember if the chain was only distributed by miners or just anyone connected to the network. I’m guessing you can’t begin sharing until you are fully synced.
PEER NOT PEAR! I’m hungry!!!!
