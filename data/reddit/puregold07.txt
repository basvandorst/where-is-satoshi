Who said I buy crypto?
I just have some bitcoin on coinbase, that's all. 
Also I know you need a wallet, but these exchange sites also have wallets. If I just want a wallet not connected to any of these, then how would I go about doing that? 
Jeez bruh you sound a little passive aggressive.

I have a question. 
Bitcoin currency or the price changes a lot; always fluctuating, right?
Say I decide to buy bitcoins. Like maybe a $1 worth or $10 and this turn into my benefit. How often does this happen? And even when it does, is it within the range of how much bitcoins were once. 
I don't know what the exchange rate would be, but say $1 = .01 bitcoin and the price changes to .10 or it wouldn't go that high and maybe change into .02? 
If someone gets what I mean anyway

This is my most wondering question because I wouldn't mind putting some money down, hoping in time it makes a big increase than what I previously spent...
