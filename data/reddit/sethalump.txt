I wouldn't be surprised if much of that is new production ASICs that were being 'burned in' before being shipped out.

Wait, folks are still buying ASICs? 
I guess we didn't learn from all the previous shady ASIC vendors....

Shady and considering the price just shot up ~$60 they might have changed their mind.
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:40:42
Yeah, this seems very fishy. Look at the other exchanges. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:31:13
oh snap, looks like a big swing. =/
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:23:14
LOL I had the exact same idea. Now I'm wondering if I jumped the gun @ 419.99 and.... =(

I'm just waiting for it to hit $420 so I can take a massive bong rip and goto bed. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:35:37
This seems odd. That volume is just nuts. Maybe mtgox got hacked. Oh man would that suck.

Just look at BTC China $820 usd

=( 
Damn, I think I jinxed it.

Someone should call Coinstar. =)
Also related. 
I saw this guy @ DefCon. At the time I laughed. Now I regret not giving it a spin.

To sum it up in one word: Difficulty.
Most folks don't realize that most of the online mining calculators do not account for the difficulty increase. 
Basically unless you can get a slamming deal on a sizable ASIC rig that's delivered in the next few days you're wasting your time. Most ASIC rigs will take a long time to show up (if ever) and by the time you get your rig online and mining the difficulty will have jumped several times. 
I say this as someone who purchased some ASICs at a 'pretty good price' and had them online in a few days. Including the current surge in price I *might* break even in ~60 days. Not long after that, based on estimated difficulty jumps, they will barely be able to cover their power cost.
Here's one online calc that accounts for the difficulty increase.   (there are better ones but I'm too lazy to find them for you)...So as everyone says, just buy and hold BTC. There are so many folks out there already mining with 1000's of GH's at their command it's pretty silly to try to hang with them due to one little fact... Difficulty. Good luck.
