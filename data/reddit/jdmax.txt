I vote for Satoshi, Yoshi and Toad
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:40:04
anyway to get this to work without it keeping a copy of the entire blockchain on my laptop?
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:30:58
even their new 'we are the best 50x faster' press release doesn't load. lol

you better do better or she'll give you a denial of service
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:12:51
I opened it up and took a screen shot !
edit: the .02242 amount was the in question, I did another tiny amount .00071 a bit later to see what would happen
2nd edit: but the damn wallet has been syncing four hours and hours and it still hasn't sync'd. Can they get frozen?

agree and its inevitable because more and more trades will take place at that level.

When was the last successful transaction you made?
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:53:21
and hard to get
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:10:03
nope ... its doubled !
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:05:26
they may have suspended trading but there is nothing stopping you from transferring BTC from gox to btc-e
so to answer your question -what will happen? Nothing. Because I doubt there are many bitcoins there right now
@_date: 2013-09-15 02:57:45
selling wheelbarrows to the miners in a gold rush but this time  ripping them off
@_date: 2013-04-07 23:27:06
but how do they know, do they ask to see you btc transaction records?  Because you could be just transferring money from euros
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:22:40
its under ddos, the figures are surely inaccurate
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:21:01
hey man, thanks for all the replies. Bitcoin-Qt finally synced. For anyone else reading - it took about 20 hrs and consumed maybe 6 or 7 gig on my laptop
@_date: 2013-04-13 11:02:12
Hi - please limit the frequency of high frequency traders. Thx !
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:55:35
okay so now that I have a minute to start up the Bitcoin-Qt application it does not say it is syncing and the balance there is still zero. How do I get it syncing again?
The blockchain.info online wallet still shows the coin went out but its in red with unconfirmed next to it
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:53:55
thanks man, I'll wait a few more days
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:48:48
disagree, we are not at the botom we are half way.  Divide the number of bitcoins created by the number that can be created
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:11:17
I had to shut my laptop before it had finished syncing. Upon returning - how do I get my local bitcoin-qt application to start syncing again?  
@_date: 2013-04-08 05:31:53
It makes sense for a miner to sell shares and increase his capital.  But whats to stop one of them disappearing with all of your money?
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:48:47
I'm not actually sure what my bitcoin address is for my local wallet. When I did the transaction I opened Bitcoin-Qt, went to Receive Coins tab and copied the ascii string and so that is what I sent to. But then I had to shut down. Will the string still be the same?  How does this instance of the downloaded file get a unique id?

I'm monitoring my network transactions with Little Snitch and I haven't seen the Bitcoin-Qt application try connect at all
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:48:55
Is there a way to cancel the transaction from my online blockchain wallet?
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:35:14
wow ... how does that work? 
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:26:40
srsly? link?
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:57:42
ah got it, thanks.   I was just thinking that all this inflation at the moment in preventing it from being used as a currency because very few want to spend. It will need to level off at the top of the S curve for things to settle down to regular spending and saving
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:13:57
got it, work had a firewall up. Now hot spotting off my phone and its syncing
