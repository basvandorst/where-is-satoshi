Yep, that and vote, too.  You can see what grass-roots movements are capable of with how the net-neutrality fight went. Yes, politicians and bureaucrats get money and gifts from PACs and special interest groups...  but they ultimately know that if they aren't in office, they will not continue getting the money and gifts.
People in the US like to bitch and moan about politicians always bending to the will of their big donors but they are usually also the same ones that do not vote.  If the US could get to where at least 70% of the population voted, PACS and special interest groups would hold much less sway - especially on the Republican side of things since in most countries higher voter turnout results in more liberal candidates being elected.

The only one that you really have a real gripe on is foreign policy.
The economy is infinitely better than it was in 2008 when he was elected although there are still real issues with it, and civil liberties is basically a wash of good and bad things that have occurred during his 2-terms.


Romney would have towed the party line once in office.  He would have gone after Snowden much more aggressively than President Obama.


Sadly, that doesn't work though...  everyone needs to vote for only non-incumbents; that's the only thing that will really get the message across.
