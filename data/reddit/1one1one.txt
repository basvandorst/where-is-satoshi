this scared the shit out of me....
"unable to broadcast", my balance said i had like a fifth of what i should have before the transaction i restarted mycelium and my balance came back... panic averted..
then i tried to send bitcoin to  a more secure place (where my balance wouldn't randomly be reduced) and i received unable to broadcast... thought id lost it again....
but it all came back after i cancelled the unable to broadcast transaction... 
thank fuck.
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:29:34
Everything's your fault

You're far too interested in me
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:36:38
V. Buterin one of the lead developers of ethereum says it will take between 2 to 5 years to establish reliable, secure, decentralised scalability. I'd rather realistic predictions, rather than the endless soon! references. At the moment bitcoin is charging 8 dollars for a basic transfer.
I don't think bitcoin is ready for main stream, i don't think any of the cryptocurrencies are. And with increase in popularity of the space it's only going to get worse. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:32:12
I think it's great the price has depressed in regard to the upcoming futures.
It's harder to short something that's being depressed already.
Because everythings down in anticipation for the future, it feels like the price will bounce up, so it's harder psychologically to short something you feel is being held down and will potentially bounce upwards.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:50:30
There's literally zero chance they'll hold, we have how much money?!
You want us to hold and do nothing, but I won't be in power by then...
Yeah that's going to get spent

Buy a second hand one in a few years
@_date: 2018-09-11 12:49:15
Okay, but replace it with what exactly...
Army rule?
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:39:12
Wait until thing settle down, the transaction fees should go back to normal once the price settles. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:27:04
Depends if they've implemented segwit
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:26:54
I mean the establishment
*owns* the currency, they can literally print money.
Buy bitcoin sell it at a loss, buy miners sell sell sell. From printing money.
However, I don't think bitcoin will ever fully disappear.
It's a fools errand to try, sure it decreases in price but it won't *ever* go to nothing, (unless hacked) 
I for one have lost access to money, there's probably millions and millions of bitcoin lost that will never leave the network.
And even if bitcoin goes to $1.
It's still viable and can be used.
It's still viable at any price.
I suppose they could make an alternative.
But at this point it's just trying to lessen the effect of bitcoin, I don't think they'll ever remove cryptocurrencies... The genie is out of the bottle
I think it's just trying to lessen their impact.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:20:04
I mean seven percent may not sound like alot on its own, but if it crashes 7% everyday for ten days, then that's like 50% correction.
It's not as crazy as what happened with bcash, in a day, but it could accumulate, with a snow ball effect. Bringing fear into the markets.
I'm being bearish, but we'll see.
I personally see these things as mile stones along the road to the future. I don't think bitcoin is going anywhere, it's here now and the cats out the box, these stages are part of the long journey, to what I see as something which is pretty much here to stay now.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:27:01
Exchange yes because no segwit probably. Again if wallets are segwit cheap no then high current fees until craziness stops
@_date: 2018-08-02 09:52:53
 is a dick
@_date: 2015-12-22 16:48:24


are you an idiot, £88.85 is ridiculous fee
Even if they list the prices on the website, 
charging someone £140 thats like a 35% fee.
that's absolutely crazy, it's pretty much theft. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 11:47:15
How does it work though, they only have your bitcoin address, not key?
@_date: 2018-05-12 11:49:20
11th of march?
@_date: 2018-08-28 11:16:42
Easy to say that now...
But when a commodity is gaining value, I'd like to see you try and sell it then

The routing number is the sort code in the UK, I think. Not tried it myself yet though
@_date: 2018-05-12 11:50:42
Well I could create a system that transfers information for nothing instantly.
But it would be centralised.
@_date: 2018-05-23 07:18:54
Funny because does anyone even know who he is? 
@_date: 2014-09-30 06:20:01
I'm worried about security, is it secure,  not sure about sending bank details online
@_date: 2014-09-30 06:27:58
Is the routing code the sort code?
@_date: 2014-09-30 06:25:13
How does this work? How is it not getting shut out by the banks?
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:46:00
Bitcoin well never lose its value completely... I my self have lost like 12 bitcoins. The dead coins will always keep the value of bitcoin. Unless it gets hacked, then we're all fucked

But you're not getting your own money.
You're using a private machine, that's giving you physical cash.
That's a service and you pay for a service.
It costs money to maintain these machines and maintain security/withstand attacks.
It's incredulous that you think these things should be absolutely free/no cost involved, $3 is a bit of money but these machines cost $ and cash is accepted everywhere. Cypto isn't so to offer a secure and dependable accessible product it costs money.
But I do agree it would be nice if everywhere accepted cypto.
But, even bitcoin cost you to spend it.
Stop acting like things happen with no cost at all and that's normal.
Maybe in the future we'll have virtually free transactions, but there's still a network to secure and maintain, a internet to pay for and machines/PCs/mobile phones to buy and use to utilise these coins.
So yeah at what point was your money ever completely free/ without some sort of cost involved?
Okay $3 is a lot, but it's not easy to offer secure physical cash in the real world and that's why these machines exist, because cash is king.
@_date: 2017-03-08 15:10:53
i hope ethereum can span the gap
@_date: 2017-03-21 05:19:04
you're ridiculous 
@_date: 2019-03-08 10:55:11
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:12:58
Yeah it seems pretty bad, 2 and half hours still waiting for one confirmation, even though the fee was over $2.5 dollars, miners must be doing very well, but it doesn't really help bitcoin, in regards to adoption.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:28:53
I used the "normal" fee, one down from priority which is preset into the app. But it's still pretty high, paid 316 sats/byte, could have paid 350. It's not the first time this month transactions have become stuck for me. I should have just paid a dollar more, it goes through but 3 dollars for a small transaction seems too much.
There are *alot* of transactions today though alot of transactions are being left behind.
I hope segwit in two days makes a meaningful difference.
ETH is cents per transaction, done in around 10 minutes.
I hope things get better, but bitcoin seems antiquated as it is at the moment.
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:41:15
I'm confused by bch and BTC they both seem to play against each other, but I'm glad to have both. People seem to say the same thing about the other "it's more centralised now". 
If bitcoin doesn't adapt to growth issues, then I think bitcoin will lose value, because fewer people will use it, if it's geared towards only large sums/doesn't adapt to large scale usage well.
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:44:43
I said there were no confirmations after 14 hours but 5 after 16 hours, what's wrong with that
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:32:27
$4254 on poloniex at one point
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:51:24
Well bitcoins the first mover. But it seems to have become unwieldy.
I hope segwit delineates the problems and assuages these teething pains
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:03:53
I thought that was one of the main issues bch is more profitable to mine, that's why transactions are taking longer to confirm and transaction costs remain high, because there's fewer miners, so transaction costs increase because it's so congested
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:32:08
What would happen I bought some too, today, it looks like you're buying an increasing commodity and free BCH on top. 
Oh you mean when the actual HF occurs, I guess it will be delayed. Coinbase won't sell any during that time I think, so I don't know if you'll even be able to on any exchange..
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:08:54
At 14 hours I had zero confirmations and at 16 I had 5 confirmations. So it's both the first statement and the recent statement. 
Why would you think it had to be one or the other?
If you weren't so rude I would be more responsive to you.  
But whatever here's the tx, even though you told me I was lying
  It says received 11 hours ago, but I did rebroadcast the transaction after a while. It was before midday yesterday and came through about 15 hours later. I guess the rebroadcast worked.
@_date: 2018-10-18 09:04:04
Did he say hodoll
@_date: 2017-01-12 19:24:42
so the number of users doesnt effect transaction times?
i find that hard to believe. i mean the number of miners effects the speed of the bitcoin network, and if they have to solve more transactions, then that will take  more computing power, as the computing power is finite, then the speed of the network is based on how many miners there are/hash power, and the load on the miners computers.
if the rate of transactions are consistent, why do transaction times vary? im pretty sure i've experienced slower transaction times as bitcoin has tried to scale with more and more users, i just hope the number of miners can keep up with the number of users. 
also blockchain.info is down i think :(
@_date: 2017-08-22 11:20:22
Well I went for the cheaper "normal" transaction fee of $2.50 and it's been 40 minutes and zero confirmations.
I really hope segwit has an impact because this is really quite concerning.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:52:11
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:10:40
Well I've been waiting over 14 hours for a $2.5 transaction for $14. 
I should get my money back.
@_date: 2017-01-12 19:09:09
yeh i wait around 30 mins for 3. but all 6 in under ten minutes, thats never happened to me before
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:15:16
I paid over 300 sat, 14 hours zero confirmations.
What an age we live in, 
transactions in only days, 
only 20% fees!
What a future we live in.
If segwit fails omg fuck bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:46:36
Yeah if segwit does what it is intended to do.
Things can change quickly in the crypto space, patience is a virtue the markets might not have time for. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 11:17:31
So segwit will decrease transaction costs?
@_date: 2017-08-10 23:38:54
I have a transaction that is still unconfirmed from yesterday, zero confirmations. Paid normal transaction fee 122 satoshi a byte
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:43:30
So it *seems* that if one doesn't exchange cryptocurrencies for fiat there's no capital gains tax?
It's only when you *take* a profit, ie converting bitcoin too dollars, right?
So if you keep them as bitcoins there's no tax? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:30:05
well it can be either  way sats or dollars per transaction its expensive for something that doesnt function properly.
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:28:39
im using myclieum to another address.
im paying 400 satoshi and recently put another one through for 500 sats hopefully that will go through.
before the two got stuck one went through without any issue.
but it seems of recent to have been very difficult indeed and im paying these fees for something which turns up really really late 
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:21:42
So high fees are here to stay?
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:16:09
Well it's been over an hour and a half now, zero confirmations, $2.5 fee, which could be down to drawing from many inputs as I'm using myclieum to transact. 
So that could show it down?/ Increase the price. Might try another client
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:13:17
Few days, really lighting network ready for practical use?
That would be something
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:51:01
But there was an exodus of miners to bch, if the hash power doesn't increase, why would things improve? 
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:12:29
4 hours, 0 confirmations
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:07:13
It's finally confirmed, after 16 hours 22 minutes, well 5 confirmations.
So many transactions today, I really hope segwit improves the situation 
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:24:36
Well it's finally started confirming
I paid 400 sat, then a cpfp at 268 sats and it finally started confirming two hours later...
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:46:24
So we're only liable for tax, if we convert bitcoin into dollars?
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:30:23
i hope so because as of now its a frustrating mess
@_date: 2016-12-18 16:33:56
I thought that the financial institutions considered bitcoin a direct threat. They colluded to pump billions of dollars into bitcoin and then dump the currency, in an attempt to inject fear, huge uncertainty into the market, in an attempt to destabilise and remove the currency
@_date: 2017-01-12 19:14:04
well it has something to do with scaling, if a ton of people sell their bitcoins, then there will be less users on the network, so less transactions = faster transactions, right?
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:57:38
I got one confirmation for my 500 sat/byte
It's been half an hour.
Well look at the price, I think bitcoin is creaking under the number of transactions. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:12:37
Unfortunately not everyone accepts litecoin
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:08:10
Yeah I don't understand the hostility in this sub. It's a free commodity. And putting blinkers on and saying everything else is rubbish, is a quick way to be uniformed and lose track of what's really going on. 
If other coins have inventive features they may challenge bitcoin or even compliment them. It's easy to get left behind if you just stick your fingers in your ears and bash every other coin.
   
@_date: 2017-08-22 11:39:27
So it's just for big purchases?
I mean that has a market, but it's vastly smaller than general adoption for general items.
@_date: 2017-08-23 10:36:00
It's both.
@_date: 2019-08-06 10:59:22
Is it certain though?
Death may be overcomeable...
If we can grow tissues, organs, replace failing parts of our bodies, even transhumanism, leaving the body behind, moving to a computerised state, becoming immortal.
Just saying it's not a totally known factor.
@_date: 2016-12-08 02:00:51
Do you know when the ledger nano s will be on Amazon again? Very interested, especially through Amazon's delivery system. From the untied kingdom
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:14:17
I looked at the transaction and it's one input and two outputs, so I don't think the number of inputs is the issue.
@_date: 2019-08-05 12:34:08
@_date: 2019-08-07 11:15:27
That's quite far away.
Who knows what we'll be capable of at that point...
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:41:29
Crash and burn, you mean go to zero?
You must be fucking retarded if you actually think that.
Maybe down to 9 thousand but I think it will bump up again.
Or it will just hold.
Either way you have something up your ass with retarded comments like this
@_date: 2016-12-08 02:08:46
Thanks, do you know if the eBay UK ledger nano s are legitimate?  
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:09:25
2.5 trillion dollars, really?
Cause the derivatives market is estimated to be $1.2 trillion.
And that's super massive.
Just looked it up... It is around that figure, crazy.
@_date: 2019-02-15 20:33:06
They could easily adapt
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:42:24
Nothing is certain.
You can be certain of that.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:49:31
So trading is taxable?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:53:42
So when the transaction occurred.
Not on the gains?
The gains are only taxed at sale.
So if one bought, we'd pay at the transaction, which is like a percent right?
So relativity that's quite low if you did that a while ago when coins were cheap. 
I mean if you've made potential gains, only the original transaction is taxed... 
The gains can't be taxed until sold right? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:06:11
Sounds like great news but the Twitter source has no information on am actual source
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:38:20
This is why we should adopt POS
ethereum is moving towards POS and some cryptocurrencies already utilise it, I think dash is a hybrid of POS and POW
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:54:45
`do they accept bank transfers?
Aren't they just an crypto exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:21:34
Why did he slap ethereum?!
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:45:51
But bitcoins not back by anything either, no cryptocurrencies are. Tether only had value because people are willing to buy it.
But it's important for people to know what they're getting into, so it's good news this is being publicised.
They could print a trillion coins and this inherent this centralised coins it kind of illustrates why bitcoin had value, but the thing that concerns me is that someone could infiltrate bitcoin core and inject malicious code into an upgrade/hard fork, that could change the number of bitcoins created.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:32:20
well it will be nice when we can utilise each computer on the network to carry out massive net computations.
And decentralise everything
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:04:23
So does POS negate the need for such mining power?
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:08:31
The funny thing is, that bitmain is making more money than ever, with sky high transaction fees on bitcoin, so they profit from the chaos
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:26:26
Yeah people are dicks about this. Stick their fingers in their ears nah nah nah, not listening!!
But fees are high and some places don't offer fee options
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:51:07
Nope $11,160 now
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:52:39
Is lightening inherently less anonymous, because it's a more centralised system?
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:10:31
Yeah, it's a hidden fee. They state the current price of bitcoin, but when the transaction actually goes through they give a rate per bitcoin for fiat and that exchange rate is offered about $200 above the exchange rate of bitfinex on top of the % fee
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:56:44
maybe its happening to eth too, $540 almost aginst everywhere else being around $470.
its like a coordinated push all around. but like billions into bitcoin....
i knew the koreans loved tech (10gb internet connections, phones samsung etc), maybe this was quite predictable.
but still fuckk....
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:09:34
But if you buy a painting and it goes up in value, one would only pay tax *if* is sold. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:17:17
Which episode is this from? 
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:06:56
It's still early...
You could look back at this point and think
How many clues did i need?
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:37:18
So we should only pay taxes when we exchange it for fiat right, capital gains.
This document states that bitcoin is treated as property in relation to taxes.
So like a house you'd only pay taxes once a sale occurred, right?
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:55:06
Already happened
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:47:41
It depends how long this contentious hash scenario stretches out.
At the moment fees are very high and it's making the network far less attractive to use.
If bitcoin can stabilise to reasonable speed and fees then fine.
But if the network continues to be stressed, money flowing into bitcoin will slow because it's not practical anymore to use it.
I just hope bitcoin isn't permanently hobbled from hash rate changes.
And we can go back to lower fees/transaction times.
But if this goes on, and we have to wait months for something that may not work.(ln)
It's going to be a hard time for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:03:26
Yeah, people don't talk about this alot, but the customer pays these fees and there was a policy stating that everything had to be the same value, even if you pay by cash!
So your paying the card fee in both cash and card purchases. And the shop isn't allowed to sell things for less of you pay by cash, visa etc would terminate your shops ability to use visa.
Long live bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:51:10
I've looked abit into this, this is what I think it means.
Futures are a type of derivative. 
A derivative is something which derives its value from another asset.
So if I bet you that bitcoin will reach $10,000 by the end of 2017, I can wager a contract saying that I'll give you $1000 dollars if it doesn't happen and you will give me $1000 dollars if it does.
It's a futures contract, based on the value of a product in the future.
The derivatives market is estimated to be worth 1.2 trillion dollars.
CME will give their customers the option to buy futures in bitcoin. CMEs is like the biggest derivatives exchange in the world.
I think they're opening options on futures on December the 13th
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:05:17
Circle were amazing.
Zero fees, I didn't really understand how they did it...
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:40:36
Not just newbies.
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:07:04
because staking the funds puts them at risk
and theyre making money off their customers!
just like the fiat bank does, which lends out your money!
and then they lost it.
i guess over time people will realise this and the exchanges will act like banks and pay people interest for using them because they are staking their coins. 
but maybe people will just stake at home or join big pools.
But i mean so what if exchanges have stake, what power could that give them anyway? tpower to make the network faster?&gt;
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:56:27
Exchanges don't have that much money.
They have other people's money, i doubt they'll be able to stake other people's money.
And yes they are a gateway, but that's always been the case, i think i that all dilute over time as more and more services offer bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:12:03
Yeah, but it's pretty promising, it's not guaranteed at all. But nothing is.
Looking at banks at the moment, high international fees, your bank account could be frozen, hacked through data leaks like Equifax, is a depreciating asset (quantitative easing) they literately create money out of thin air, which devalues the currency over all (the federal reserve created $12 trillion dollars out of thin air since 2008) ie the dollar buys less and less each year, while bitcoin has a fixed supply and looks to actually increase in value over time
 
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:14:00
well people will vote with their crypto wallets and which ever chain is the most attractive will succeed.
I think POS will speed up transactions too, with less computations.
Yeah hybrid will popl  up tey already have (DASH) but i hope we move over to POS as were using a crazy amount of power with hash rates
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:34:10
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:14:27
It's kind of like a heart beat, pumping money around the world
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:22:40
And then people crying when they pick up their Tesla's a year later and they could have bought three
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:00:54


oh yeah
its meant to 1.2 QUADRILLION dollars.
that makes more sense
1,200,000,000,000,000 dollars
a thousand times bigger than 1.2 trillion dollars
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:55:07
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:00:46
Oh, okay
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:57:04
Err is at over $11,100 right now

It is a contentious issue.
I mean if things go back to less expensive (still not great) fees and less transaction times, which were pretty dependable but could be improved.
Then fine nothing to worry about.
It could pass on a few days and this was just an anomaly.
But if the disruption continues then it's pretty dire. But it fees so seem to be dropping along with transaction times.
I hope it does abate, but right now it feels pretty bad.
And if it starts like this then it would be an issue, but I think most people think it will just abate

It's been around some time time. Seems to work pretty reliably most of the time. There's not that many fiat currency exchanges well I've heard of a few like Kraken, Gemini.

Did you read what I actually said?
Why are you saying oh god no man?
We pay tax at point of sale.
So relativity if I bought a bitcoin for $100 I'd pay a percentage of that transaction.
If I held the bitcoin since then, the asset would not be liable for any other taxes until I sold that bitcoin.
But it gets complicated, I mean surely not every trade would be taxed, what about day traders, they compete 100's of transactions a month. I think it's got to be quite convoluted.
Although if we made a loss, that should be tax deductible, so there's that.

It didn't revolve around Vitalik Buterin, it was based on a consensus of miners, much like bch. He didn't decide what happens, it depends on whether miners follow the fork.
The DOA hack was the reason for the fork. In fact ETH has more transactions than bitcoin recently.
ETH can scale, but not to the level of visa, at this time. ETH can process around 15 transactions a second, while visa achieves 45,000 a second
And Yes you're talking about Raiden Network. It is off chain and isn't ready yet but it's interesting to see how they deal with this problem
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:15:45

@_date: 2017-10-21 23:51:31
Depends on adoption.
Say for instance, there's a cataclysmic event, that effects the US dollar, ie another banking crisis, then bitcoin could shoot up in value as a world currency.
Also the bigger bitcoin grows the more viable it becomes, it's like a snow ball effect
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:36:06
you are right, without activate internet, the blockchain will be inaccessible.
I hope we can create a decentralised internet as well.
However, if the internet, electricity are out down for a sustained period of time, i dont think there will be an economy to use bitcoin in.
i dotn think people will be worrying about currency if there isnt power to warm your homes/water etc...
But maybe this is where raiden/lightening channels will work, where bluetooth/local wifi tethering could implement offline transactions, while the infrastructure is out. And then solar panels in the back of the phones for electricity if the local power company goes out...

All these institutions and more rely on the dominance of the current system.
And they can make money.
So yeah, it's going to be a bumpy ride.
Strap yourselves in. They can destabilise the currency at any point (I would guess they've been buying a lot of crypto for this purpose) and when they want to they can throw the price way of and destabilise the confidence in this asset, making people question is validity.

everyone here seems pretty certain bitcoin won't be superseded. and the price will keep mooning.
But does it concern you that quantum computing, or a rival technology could make bitcoin obsolete?
i mean in ten years time do you think bitcoin can evolve fast enough, to keep up with new systems, based on new tech, and it can just be patched/adapted to keep up with the escalation in technological progression?

Yes they can buy bitcoin, but everyone they buy increases the price. And yes they could print money ad infinitum, but by doing so, they decrease the value of their currency, so fiat buys less and less bitcoin. And why would they want to buy something they ultimately can't control.

It's already behind the curve.
Expensive transaction rates, only really used as a store of value.
The reason bitcoin leads is because it's all the noobs hear about.

@_date: 2019-05-14 20:30:36
What's are you referring to, don't tell me to study, what a pointless arguement... Tell me! Cite something, what do you know?
@_date: 2019-05-15 06:52:21
Well bitcoin costs more to move, so that's a negative, Ethereum has cost less to transfer value for a while.
Bitcoin is really only a store of value (which it isn't great at, as if you want to buy something small, you'll probably pay more for the transaction costs than the product!)
While Ethereum has smart contracts so it's easily more than just a store of value.
It feels l like bitcoin is behind the times.
you can't say it's the cheapest for transactions and that it can be used for other things other than a store of value.
I've heard that smart contracts could be brought to the block chain but it hasn't actually happened.
Transfer times are slow and it's expensive to use. Two fundamental elements that bitcoin has yet to deal with.
It does have the fact that it's been around the longest, so therefore had had the most time to undergo stress testing.
Basically all the noobs are hearing of bitcoin first and going into that because they have no idea of other cypto currencies.
I dunno there seems to be disagreement within the bitcoin space, the lightning network doesn't seem to have been fully adopted yet, how long has that being coming?
But is it had first movers advantage, with being around and surviving the longest, which is no small thing.
But I don't think it has the fastest or cheapest network.
But it is the most secure, as it has lasted the longest.
We'll see, but I think as soon as people realise new tech exists that transfers value faster and at less cost, then it will be hard to ignore.
@_date: 2019-05-15 12:29:54
I think so, let's do some maths.
100,000,000 x 21,000,000 = 
Basically 2.1 quadrillion dollars
Or 21 thousand trillion dollars.
How much value is there in the world?
There's around $90 trillion in physical cash.
Property is set at $247 trillion and derivatives is set at $1.2 quadrillion high end.
So yeah, maybe $1.5 quadrillion dollars in the world value.
So it's just off, maybe with the value of water etc. So the maximum, of all property, derivatives, cash, loans went into bitcoin, it would be $1.5 quadrillion/ 21 Millon bitcoin = $71,428,571.428571 a coin. Maximal amount, as things stand.
But there's inflation etc, so billions more dollars could be added to the system, but bitcoin is built against that!

Yeah being held in Mtgox, on people online wallets. Although now it looks like its dependant on currency. So could be amounts put into wallet from certain currencies? or the trades taking places with that currency in mind. So it looks like GBP has much less in the way of volume whatever the volume accounts for. Its usually in the 1000's like 4345 BTC 
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:31:01
Well he said $100,000 this year, ten times the price every two years...
2021, $1,000,000
2023, $10,000,000
2025, $100,000,000
So 0.001 = $100,000
Not really enough for life, but a Millon dollars of it increases in value by ten fold in two years.

most secure way? well then that would be to write down/memorise the failsafe pin codes so you could use them if you lost your phone. Now put that code in your wallet or pgp encrypt it as well. none of these ways is that practical though if your say, away from your computer. ive email myself the codes to different email addresses so i can access the back ups in a random email  message i have sent myself in that email account. All this security though, i know i feel it one day im going to be so secure, ill end up locking myself out

you can trade without verification. Buy Bitcoins move them in out etc
 1. No verification needed (Level 0) - All accounts are initially Level 0
Being “level 0” has the following limits:
 
Traditional Currencies
Daily withdrawal limit (24hrs): 1,000 USD (or equivalent) 
Monthly withdrawal limit: 10,000 USD (or equivalent) 
Daily Bitcoin withdrawal limit (24hrs): 100 BTC
Monthly Bitcoin withdrawal limit: none
 
“Level 0” is designed for basic users, consumers and Bitcoin enthusiasts where 10,000 USD (monthly) is enough for most needs.

i don't think that bitcoin will "topple governments". If it becomes mainstream and legitimised then it will be taxed. Just like the revenue of sales is  today, things will be done above board  (sells receipts taxation on profits can easily be applied to bitcoin). I agree it may be easier to be covert  with bitcoin, but major companies will still pay billions in tax albeit through bitcoin as a major currency. Not iuntil we do away with all currencies will be see the bloated defence budget drop because there will be little need or it. Most wars today are fought over resources ie oil. If we no longer need oil ie solar power, electric vehicles etc the need for foreign policy will dissipate. countries wont be invaded for oil, corporate companies will no longer exist as all food is produced by AI farms and is free because we all have universal salary, so everything we need is pretty much free, ie we print everything we need with our advanced 3d printers at home,  utopia, yay. 
Now back to the present, yes its not nice that these "thugs and murderers" use bitcoin but its a very useful tool and bitcoin is for everyone and anyone. Its neutral, its justs a tool. a revolutionary tool. yes they can make fake businesses accounts fake IDs but why bother ? just send it by bitcoin with zero paper trail. No crossing border going through various bank accounts creating paper trails digital traces.. okay bitcoin has a trace but its easily contained. Much easier than traditional methods of world payment. Bitcoin doesn't need anything its a piece of software. But, these people and like chinmusic86 mentioned, drugs are a major force behind bitcoin, promoting its value and uptake. If it is used by covert agencies then they have a vested interest in seeing bitcoin survive or even its successor. Okay allies is a string term... maybe powerful associates is more prevalent term. the government can't regulate bitcoin. Its out of their control. They could try peg it, but natural market forces will overcome that.

i do know what volume trade is. I didn't know what volume is was specifying to. It is presumptual to consider that banks / traditional methods of currency wouldn't like what Bitcoin represents. London/GBP have a vested interest in maintaining the old standards. A recent DDOS against Mtgox showed that half of the attack was originating in LON. So its not absolutely wild speculation that banking interests would attack. Anyway a decrease in volume in GBP traded could be considered positive, as its a decrease from an area of currency that finds bitcoin disruptive.

I have heard stories of people being delayed with payments, but this does not mean that they are a scam. Its libelous to say things like that, based on the a process being slow. I have used OKPAY for over $500 dollars and have no problems. I'm verified as well. I think with larger amounts they have stricter policies in place for vetting and such. Of the stories i have heard okpay do get the situation sorted, although they are slow

I think VISA, MASTERCARD, PAYPAL have more to worry about than Wall Street. Bitcoin is a direct competitor. Also financial institutions, such as the federal reserve (who print money) would consider bitcoin a threat. They can't print bitcoin! or make money through loans etc. well technically they could loan bitcoins... but its a far more lucrative deal they have right now.

Yeah they now accept it. Thought it was cowardly not to accept Bitcoin. They cared more about protecting themselves then supporting new technology which I think of as a conflict of interest. How can they support Digital freedoms when they act with suspicion and fail to embrace new technologies. Disappointing for an operation failing to practice what they preach. Actions speak louder than words. Also if we donate it gets directly processed into Fiat. Devaluing the currency. For an organisation that half heartily supports Bitcoin it feels like a timid response from a group of people that don't get or fully understand Bitcoin. And should be building confidence rather than treading lightly. They also ask for your address and other personal data before you can donate to them. Its nice to hear they added this feature. I just feel like its the fashionable thing to do. Not that they actually have Faith in the technology

Sounds a great idea. Let me know of you want a hand. I'm based in London uk. The difficulty is getting on the banking network and staying there. Its a cabal! Ha anyway we could set up business accounts and start a business exchanging Bitcoin

does anyone know if a hard drive is encrypted using AES. and its your main computer, does that stop people accessing the computer while it is in use online?
