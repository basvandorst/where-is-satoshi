Yeah, right, tell that to Sony. They exfiltrated 2TB from their offices and they didn't notice shit.

was talking about the average in China. pointed out what the average in a single city of China is.
You know you can have a different average hourly wage in El Paso, TX, and in the whole USA?

Sure, your comparison is perfect. Good job. 
@_date: 2015-12-09 10:49:44
What a shitty comparison.
* Satoshi isn't performing an action during a long period of time (years). He did something once, before he was known or looked for. DPR was managing SR while being on a Most Wanted list.
* Satoshi isn't running a service in a VM hosted in a server company that is either compromised by the NSA, complacent with the FBI, or both.
* Satoshi isn't trying to get rich selling the BTC he has. He is letting them rot, and will continue to ignore them until he dies (or someone bruteforces his priv key).
DPR could have perfect INFO/COM/OPSEC  and still get caught. Nakamoto will remain anonymous as long as he wants to.

What makes you think they haven't?
My theory, since SL closed, is that NSA or CIA is behind all this. They have these BTC. They have MtGox's BTC. They are probably one of the biggest miners.
They cant defeat Bitcoin, so the logic move is to try and control as much bitcoins as possible. Once they have a big %, they can start playing with the prices until they have nearly 100%.
@_date: 2014-10-01 11:58:08
Yeah, the whole idea behind IP was that.
The huge circlejerk comment by misses this point, and a more important one: over time, people will create backbones at every meshnet important enough, just like there's a BTC mining farm that mines nearly 50% of the new blocks.
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:05:02


Yes, there is a very important reason. The server knows your password. In clear. So the least bad thing it can do is impersonate you on other websites.


On that site, yes. But not in all the other websites you are registered.

Noob question here: when you deposit BTC to MtGox, you send them to an account that belongs to them (or several accounts). Those accounts must be public, right? Can we check if that address belongs to them this way?
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:51:57
Ok, thanks. I was looking for proofs that the guys at MtGox ran with the money, which I think is what actually happened.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:18:41
So it should be fairly easy to determine whether or not that account with transactions worth 744.000 BTC belongs to MtGox.
@_date: 2016-03-03 10:02:46
*We* can. But those who are making big money on fees won't let *us*.
Decentralization my ass.

So? In software engineering there's a rule that goes "the more bugs you find, the more secure your code is". It means that, on average, all pieces of code have the same percentage of bugs. The only difference is some developers do a better job testing &amp; auditing and thus find said bugs (resulting in a more secure and bug-free codebase), while others brag about not having bugs when in reality they just couldn't find them or didn't even bother.
tl;dr finding a lot of bugs/vulnerabilities means your code os *more* secure, not *less* secure.
@_date: 2015-07-20 23:25:23


The most common isn't the most dangerous. You could get RCE just by being in the same network as a vulnerable GNU/Linux machine (dhcpd was one of the vulnerable clients).
So yeah, they are kind of comparable.

You can make up all the excuses you want ("I eat a lot", "my kitchen is so bad"), but you're still eating out every day. That's the exact opposite of being frugal, so the "youth burns money on avocados toasts" stereotype applies to you.
You may think £8 is a deal, but you could be eating for £2 or even less. I eat for less than £2 when I give myself treats big time (eating what I want), and when I decide to be frugal I can go as low as &lt;£1 per meal.
I don't mean to convince you to live frugally, it's your life and you should be happy. But with those excuses you are just lying to yourself, not us.
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:30:49
The math I did was 60€ on food per week (with several "luxuries" like steaks, avocados, etc.), 30€ when I want to go somewhat frugal, but you could go lower. Take a look at * 60€, 7 days, 3 meals/day* = 2.8€ (£2.47)
* 30€, 7 days, 3 meals/day* = 1.4€ (£1.23)
*I actually eat more than 3 meals per day, but whatever.

Of course I was talking about a fair and uncorrupted patent system.
@_date: 2015-09-23 14:52:44
No it wouldn't. For a patent to be accepted you have to prove that *you* invented it. If someone else was using it before you, it's trivial to prove you didn't invent it. So no patent.

You are somewhat wrong.
Bitcoin is a currency, implemented using a mixture of technologies. Most (if not all) of those technologies existed before Bitcoin. Bitcoin just puts them together, and produces a nice result. Sure, you can call Bitcoin a technology if you want. It's just building blocks all the way down.
You could take most of those technologies and implement something different than the *Bitcoin currency* (I don't know, a backup system), but the differences would be substantial. For example, the script language would need to be changed a lot. And the tx structure and content. It wouldn't be "Bitcoin technology applied to X". It *wouldnt* be Bitcoin, it would be something different, Bitcoin's cousin if you want.
One of those technologies is Blockchain, which, contrary to what many people think, existed way before Bitcoin. (Blockchain is the buzzword here, I agree, just like "VISA is using SHA1/P2P technology" would make SHA1 or P2P a buzzword too). Other technologies in Bitcoin would be ECDSA, P2P, SHA256, etc.
Bitcoin is popular because at some point it got critical mass due in part to (non-mass) media attention. But's it's neither the first crypto-currency, nor the best one. It's like the Facebook of crypto-currencies, you use it because it's widespread.
Edit: so back to the post you were replying to, yes, you can use Bitcoin as a data-structure ignoring the "currency" aspect of it. You will need to pay the fees, that's for sure, but you don't need to spend further BTC, you can always use the same TX: X bitcoins from address Y to address Y.
@_date: 2016-05-17 09:00:26
No. Bitcoin is *not* anonymous. It's pseudonymous.

@_date: 2016-07-11 14:04:19
Yes. But that's like predicting the widespread use of electrical cars. It hasn't happened, and it will take several decades, but it's not hard to predict it from our current position, or even 10 years ago.

The main reason they are so accurate is because cybermoney 
*existed* when these books were written. They aren't predicting the future, just analyzing the state and trends of that moment.
"Bit gold", a cryptocurrency and a very important precursor to Bitcoin, existed at least one year before "The sovereign individual" was written.
