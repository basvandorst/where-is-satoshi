0.05BTC on the way :) (sent from GLBSE wallet, be patient)
@_date: 2012-08-22 11:36:34
The developers should stick to this - no bitcoin addresses for masses.
@_date: 2012-08-19 17:15:46
Yes I have the same feelings, especially with pirate messing with market, he has a lot of coins and together with social manipulation he could do a bad things. (just my speculation) Look at the mtgox charts 36 hours before the price starting to crash, what is this?
@_date: 2012-07-10 18:33:17
Kidding? maybe. Practical application? mmm, mine litecoin, then exchange litecoins for bitcoins :] I don't know, maybe the litecoin in five years will be where the bitcoin is now. Actually there was a rally on litecoin, 1 LTC was worth of 0.01 BTC, now it is back on 0.004, it was 0.001 a week ago. Also the total network hashrate of litecoin in recent days is booming. But it is up to you, just do some research on Litecoin and you will see...
@_date: 2012-08-06 13:12:07
I suggest an article - 
@_date: 2012-07-10 12:04:58
Absolutly briliant, this will be the biggest cyberpunk movie ever. The secret AI (somehow distributed in P2P network) become self-aware, and started to modifying the meat space through outsourcing jobs on humans in exchange for bitcoins. Then the hero comes to scene which one day on his regular workday payed with BTC that comes through bitcoin mixing service discovered the real source of his income and the hell ride begins.
@_date: 2012-08-31 13:48:58
Wait with this question to ASIC miners HW :)
@_date: 2012-07-24 20:12:20
Now please take a break and look at the security side of things. I am not a developer but if you are working with private keys just realize that you are playing with real value storage. Just a little heads up..:)
@_date: 2012-07-15 12:07:06
I think that a lot of geeks learned about money, economic and trading thanks to Bitcoin. If you don't see it - there is completely new community evolving around these cryptocurrecies and it has a potential to make the dinosaurs of economics just a history.
@_date: 2012-06-29 22:04:19
"sub-ers" got angry because of new watch functionality recently added and DDOSed forums just for lulz. True story :-P
@_date: 2012-08-14 11:45:44
I will definitely use a brainwallet and keep the passphrase in your mind only. It is a little risky but never know what the custums do with your electronic devices.
@_date: 2012-08-22 12:09:13
Yeah, know this. Is it a standard, any other sw use this? CoinBase may be working the same way, isnt it?. But it is about the masses who will never use bitcoin addresses, this is too complicated to them, they need the simple way
@_date: 2012-08-19 21:13:24
I was just joking with inner cyrcle :)
[I cannot sleep now.](
@_date: 2012-07-16 19:46:10
Me to, so there is more than 3 users :-P
Edit: what about ?
@_date: 2012-08-19 21:07:09
OMG, is this that big announcemnt coming in september? :-O
@_date: 2012-07-10 14:33:30
2011-11. The crazy thing for me is that I heard of bitcoin in 2009 and I though it is great thing. But I completely forget about it because of little attention by media and others. When I re-discovered it I was asking myself how the hell I miss it?
@_date: 2012-07-12 07:45:29
Behind the scenes are bitches like RIAA and MPA. While I would like to see these site to start accepting bitcoins, this will surely be a big war, those copyright organisations is something big different than USA gov. or FBI, they will do anything to stop using bitcoins to pay for filesharing services and they are much more powerful than gov. This will be big.
@_date: 2012-08-15 14:28:27
I am pretty familiar with generating Bitcoin address on computer, I do this way mostly - generate private key/address pair, store it securely and than import it to wallet for use both offline or online. But I was curios if it is possible to avoid computers completely to generate address for long term secure storage of bitcoins.
Edit: bitcoin address is really only SHA-256-ed private key? How difficult is to make a different formats of bitcoin addresses?
@_date: 2012-07-16 19:43:53
Lol, I must talk to my wife, if she will do this (for a better price) :-P
@_date: 2012-08-09 12:35:52
Holy shit, is something broken on gox?
@_date: 2012-08-17 18:56:02
LOL, now I am starting to offer my services on predicting future - hell, yesterday I have a bad feeling and sold all of these -  and today pirateat40 anounces this. Come on bitcoiners, I know the future, for a small amount of bitcoins I can tell you what will happen tomorrow. :P
@_date: 2012-08-22 12:17:43
lol, I am using blockchain.info/wallet for half a year and didn't noticed that. :)
@_date: 2012-08-18 10:19:16
Now when the pirate is closing his shop could he reveal what was the mechanism to generate such an insane interest?
@_date: 2012-07-14 11:25:05
Despite of how is this a stupidest idea, only one way that comes to my mind how to implement it is that tainting coins would be done after 100% of users agrees to it. But I can't imagine how to do it. And forget about it, it is really a bad idea in p2p system like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-07-15 19:49:17
I agree. And my question is could this be a problem also with P2Pool if it takes more than 50%?
@_date: 2012-08-05 14:44:10
Every time I use bitcoin address I ALWAYS had the private key securely stored offline. Just saying...
@_date: 2012-08-19 20:14:58
another one with insider info, lol is there some kind of "inner cyrcle" of bussinesmen and developers? :P
so, let me please have restful sleep, is it something about 
1)new software or new feature in sw?
2)some bussines around money tx or exchanges?
3)new hw eg mining, hw wallet, ...?
4)legal stuff?
and is it really only one thing or bunch of exciting projects? when I am looking on the list I am excited. :) (but wtf bitdaytrade.com??)
@_date: 2012-08-31 05:00:09
@_date: 2012-08-31 21:12:40
Input was 13qdre, 1dkyb was only in output
These repeating binary messages are something boring these days :/
And I am suprised about two things:
1)it is not clear who has the private key for 1dkybe, but it is widely speculated that it is pirate
2)after all the drama around BCST this address (supposed to belong to him) is still receiving coins, now I know why he has so many coins :P
@_date: 2012-07-24 20:03:43
Where?  isn't mine and has no transaction since 2010. :)
@_date: 2012-08-05 15:09:58
So it is killing your privacy. Where do you got that bitcoins you sent to SR? 
@_date: 2012-07-14 08:26:01
That's nice man!
@_date: 2012-07-10 18:52:35
exactly this - 
@_date: 2012-06-21 20:57:55
More laundering services, the better for trying to hide, just send your coins trough all of them to get higher anonymity.
@_date: 2012-08-14 16:51:07
This types of analysis make me smile. It looks to me like a predicting from a crystal ball. I mean it - I need a serious, reliable and raw data from companies around the bitcoin, from exchanges, from miners, from studies performed on bitcoiners and any other possible sources. All this get together in nice tables, graphs and conclusions made of it.  And I think that I am not alone who need this and there is sure a lot of people who will pay for such a thing. So?
@_date: 2012-07-16 15:54:44
Yay, I am watching  and wondering where is the price going. 
@_date: 2012-08-22 16:42:26
The masses IMHO don't bother anonymity, otherwise they don't use paypal and others.
@_date: 2012-08-08 12:18:34
How do you know that? 
@_date: 2012-08-26 15:33:03
I mean to have so many Bitcoins :-)
@_date: 2012-08-19 21:17:06
damn it, you are killing me! :P
@_date: 2012-08-08 17:45:40
C'mon guys, time to start annoy your favourite porn suppliers to accept BTC :P
@_date: 2012-08-08 10:38:41
Place your bets: will this affect price of BTC?
@_date: 2012-08-04 23:17:59
Exactly, he's been inventing wheel :-)
@_date: 2012-08-23 19:15:49
on the top of that stairs is Pirate and he is throwing down coins on bitlane. could you please make a meme from this? 
@_date: 2012-07-23 18:29:21
LOL, whenever I received an Apple product on christmas I will imidietly throw it to Bitmit. 8-)
@_date: 2012-06-29 22:26:20
Could this be implemented directly in bitcoin transactions?
@_date: 2012-08-30 10:56:54
(OT) :P but this is mining operation
@_date: 2012-08-03 12:24:33
How can anybody buy all the bitcoins if they were unable to buy my bitcoins? 8-)
@_date: 2012-07-22 20:18:50


Same problem here, almost hour this is showing on the page.
@_date: 2012-07-12 15:53:23
bitdrop could be more easy to setup.
@_date: 2012-07-24 19:13:00
A lot of nations has their own bitcoin channels on irc, for example  :]
@_date: 2012-07-25 19:25:08
Yeah, I know, but it hits me when I was trying to move bitcoins fast and need 6 confirmations. It takes &gt;2hrs, the last time I need send BTCs fast I was hit by orphaned block. F*k the probabilty :)

Use Namecoin instead.

Next time rather take care about your privacy.
@_date: 2012-08-31 13:50:42
Until it is sent from (not to) 1dky address it is boring...at least for me.
@_date: 2012-08-03 22:14:14
Um, I don't know why to care of them. :-)
@_date: 2012-08-23 22:01:26
and address where I send you reward?
@_date: 2012-08-15 14:43:49
Trust me, I know it and practice it quite often :)
This is for tinfoilhat-folks - in that computer could be installed some awful hw with awful firmware that could steel your hard earned bitcoins, or an awful government will adopt a law that every computer must use this awful spy hw. Then this could be useful. :)
But never mind, this is only for my lols on playing with bitcoin. :)

If the user did not use secured http properly it is useless in securing his comunication.
@_date: 2012-08-18 10:52:57
You are unable to say if it is lost or someone is saving it for another 20 years. Instead of trying to figure out how to restore "lost" coins it will be better to try to improve wallet SW to prevent loosing them and to teach people how to store them securely.
@_date: 2012-08-23 18:06:44

@_date: 2012-07-18 14:13:05
Hell, this happens every time I want to buy some BTC. Please, speculators give a break :]
@_date: 2012-06-29 22:16:07
It is worse - dollars are used to kill people, devastate nature, gain political power and to support wars.

OMG, I am only a poor admin of a few servers and desktops, but my security practices are far better then this amateurs and they were running a financial platform. It all looks like a bad soap opera or it was all an inside job.
BTW, isn't this a great chance for a security experts and companies to offer their services to this startups in exchange for bitcoins? And maybe insurance companies?

I swear I saw the site that was selling a whole variety of professional picklocks for bitcoins back in the last year, but can't find it now. Was it also illegal?
@_date: 2012-08-19 17:07:10
My bet is that Ukash have something to do with the big announcement coming on september - they will announce something big or interesting and it will make a Bitcoin price more resilient against price instability. 
@_date: 2012-07-24 19:15:42
Send me some bitcoins and I will ask my crystal ball :)

NSA (or CIA or another) experimenting with new design of cryptocurency. The developers was held under NDA. NSA (controlled by the ellite banksters) realized that this cryptocurency could harm their masters so they decided to clear all the evidence of it including developers. One of the developer (or more of them) luckily escape and hide in the other corner of the world. Now he has this cryptocurrency and he knows that it could change the world to a better place. But he can't put it directly on internet because the NSA is after him so he (or them) created pseudonym called Satoshi Nakamoto and through Tor and other privacy tools releases Bitcoin. Then suddenly Nakamoto disappeared - they catch him...
Wait, it is not a movie plot, that's how it actually happend :P
