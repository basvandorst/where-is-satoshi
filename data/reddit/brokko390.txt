Does anyone know if new wallets that will support LN are being developed? Most people have no use for DigitalOcean droplets, they just want to see a GUI that allows them to make transactions in real time.

Thanks, I'll check them out!

Look at two big hashing rate drops that happened in the last month alone - one on 12/06 and another one on 12/18. Now correlate this with price drops that ensued a few days later.

I don't think it's some sort of technical indicator - but it may indicate that there is a definite collusion among the miners. It's not the first time...
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:57:08
Also on 11/10 -huge drop, followed (in 2 days) by a drop in price.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:08:39
Well, I am not saying it's a perfect forecaster of the price action, but it may be something to watch out for.

It's called volatility. In a bear market altcoins lose more value than BTC and in a bull market they gain more value. Do you want BTC to realize 90% market dominance? Be careful what you wish for - that will *most likely* only happen if BTC falls to pre-2017 levels.

Well, the end goal of the process would be to send them through Wasabi Coinjoin which would actually add a good level of anonymity. I will add that step to the description to be more precise.

I second that. A verified Linux image is a good place to start from. If you want to be even more paranoid - mind the hardware you are using. Specifically, check out Libreboot and these vendors -  or 
In general, the level of security you will strive for is driven by the value of assets you are trying to protect. Your security measures aimed at protecting 0.1 btc will be different from those used to secure 10 BTC.

Ok, since there is some interest about the topic, I will try to publish this in a day or two - a step by step guide with a rationale behind it.

Absolutely - if you just want to connect to 3rd party ElectrumX - that's fine. However, with EPS you do get that extra layer of privacy, because you are not connecting out to anyone else and you are not letting anyone connect to you.
@_date: 2019-03-17 05:27:02
That works too - but only for specific use cases. The concern may be that in step 1 you are revealing something extra about your past transaction history by including multiple UTXOs in a single transaction - because Ledger automatically combines outputs that may have come from different tx’s with different levels of anonymity. Some of your funds on Ledger may have been purchased with cash and do not need to be CoinJoined at all.
@_date: 2019-03-17 16:46:08
I had tried it (connecting to my own EPS) and it did not show any history at all (while showing the correct receiving addresses). 
 In fact this is exactly what electrum-personal-server-scan program does when you first set it up for existing wallets - it needs to scan the blockchain from a given height or date, before you can even run an electrum server.
Edit: if you are connecting to ElectrumX servers, you will get the your history at the expense of minor privacy loss.
@_date: 2019-03-17 05:39:19
Exactly - but that means if you want to control **current** Ledger Nano S wallet with Electrum and be able to see previous UTXOs - that actually takes a bit of work, - and I am not sure it is obvious to most people that it can even be done or how to go about it.
@_date: 2019-03-17 17:08:04
My bad, you are correct - by default electrum wallet connects to ElectrumX servers which in fact operate differently from EPS. However, since we are aiming at most privacy, it would make sense that you would not want to connect to 3rd party ElectrumX, but will want to connect to  your own EPS. So, for those who are interested in that latter option - it takes some effort.
From the [github page]( 
**How is this [EPS] different from other Electrum servers ?**
They are different approaches with different tradeoffs. Electrum Personal Server is compatible with pruning, blocksonly and txindex=0, uses less CPU and RAM, is suitable for being used intermittently rather than needing to be always-on, and doesn't require an index of every bitcoin address ever used. *The tradeoff is when recovering an old wallet, you must to import your wallet first and you may need to rescan, so it loses the "instant on" feature of Electrum wallet. Other Electrum server implementations will be able to sync your wallet immediately even if you have historical transactions, and they can serve multiple Electrum connections at once.*

See my reply to WasabiWasabiB - if this is a brand new wallet you are creating - all fine and good. However, if you want to control your existing Ledger Bitcoin wallet(s) (with existing tx’s) - it will not.
@_date: 2019-03-18 16:08:35
Just put the link to the guide in the post description.
@_date: 2019-03-17 15:17:26
If you create a new Electrum wallet it will start watching for transactions involving this wallet’s public keys - andin the case of importing an existing wallet that was generated by Ledger, it will do the same, **but not going back in time** - thus showing a balance of 0. If your electrum wallet is connecting to 3rd party ~~EPS servers~~  (thanks for the correction WasabiWasabiB) Electrum X (default), I do not think it is possible at all, however you can do it by running your own Electrum personal server.
@_date: 2019-03-17 17:38:15
That sounds like fun, not sure I have the hardware right now to host something like this - it sounds prohibitively resource-intensive. We are talking about maintaining every address ever used - probably in RAM? Curious how it would scale even in a couple of years.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:50:25
They will think twice before shorting something that has a hard cap limit. Somehow "unlimited downside risk" doesn't quite express it.
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:53:07
It works, confirmed.
@_date: 2018-07-13 15:14:03
1) Yes - see  Depending on whether or not you use hardened or non-hardened keys, your index number will be either between 0 and 2^31 -1 or between 2^31 and 2^32 - 1.
2) No, because these use one-way hash functions and you can never go up the derivation path, only down.
3) No, by the same logic as  Every time you generate a new child key you use SHA-512 hash (a one-way function), so even changing one bit (index number) will produce a totally different hash.

He is supposed to be coming up with answers, not questions.

Don' forget Wasabi Wallet - awesome CoinJoin feature and it uses bech32 addresses to send and receive funds.
