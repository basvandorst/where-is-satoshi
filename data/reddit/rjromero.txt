Yes you have to have Electrum open and you have to be on a http:// webpage long enough for it to scan your ports and find the Electrum server running (maybe 45 seconds).

You’re gambling on the script system though. The script system has had features removed and added numerous times, I wouldn’t be surprised if in the future all script functions are disabled besides the ones required to do P2PKH. I’ll read more into it though, thanks!

You're right, I also just realized Lightning transactions will need to use OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY in order to setup channels, so it should be available for many years to come.

Yes unfortunately. It's hard to find a good wallet now-a-days that will just let you import a darn private key and hold it for you. I guess no one wants to be blamed for computer failures, losing wallet files, etc.. and a 12 word seed is deemed more resilient.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:59:21
I'm guessing this is why no one will let you import a private key.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:37:14
As long as you sent the funds to to a 12 word (paper wallet) seeded address, and not to the address of the private key you imported, yes your money is still there.

No and most Bitcoin implementations ATM are semi quantum resistant in that private keys are not reused for all transactions and change, and public keys are not revealed until you broadcast a transaction from that change address.
The threat of quantum computing is some theoretical calculation where the private key can be derived from the public key (reversing the ECDSA curve), however, there are other curve functions that are fully quantum resistant that Bitcoin could soft fork to easily should quantum computers become common.

It's a crazy good deal... No chance of profit with Bitcoin, maybe XMR/Electroneum. Even then, at least 10 other ways to make good profit out of them at $0.05/a server that doesn't involve mining. Could be done very easily... I need to go to China.
@_date: 2018-03-17 06:48:40
Those servers are cracked (stolen) and the hash rate on even 1,000 won't be profitable, or they would already be mining themselves before selling them. Those are probably all Pentiums running insecure versions of XP service pack 2 rofl.
I'm curious who's your source though? $0.05 an install is really cheap for China... If they all have unique IPs you can make more money operating a Socks 5 service...
@_date: 2018-03-17 07:00:23
That's what I'm saying, I think with XMR/1080TI you're probably looking at $30 a month or so.

Satoshi was just a regular guy, probably Hal Finney. But Hal Finney was contacted by an intergalactic corporation of investment trader-time lords to create Bitcoin to ramp up the production of the ASICS required to decode the cryptographic message being beamed to Earth in the form of solar rays from the great incubator &amp; information seeder we know as "the sun." Hal is frozen at Alcor right now but he'll be revived approximately the same time we've got enough cryptographic power to break the message and formally receive our invitation, and he (Satoshi Nakamoto/Hal Finney) will sign a message from the genesis block and become our world's delegate to the confederacy. Why? The trader-time lords desperately needed more systems to add to the cosmic blockchain for decentralization of the universe, so they made the sun and waited about 5 billion years, but that's nothing for intergalactic trader-time lords.

Not sure what you're saying. I don't think you'll earn over $30/40 month these days mining with a single 1080TI. You can find calculators for it online though.

WS Analysts are right... most of the time, and that's all that matters. Even if your firm is right 50.1% of the time that's enough to make profit. 
It's pretty comical to think that these firms have millions in operating expenses, dozens of double finance/math PhDs on payroll, global offices in million dollar high rises, illegal collusion, insider "information" and manufacturing contacts in China, and even with all of that... These guys are lucky to break a 2% ROI per month on their portfolios.
Granted, that's often 2% on billions of dollars, so it's still a nice big return. But still... all of that to break 2%?????
@_date: 2018-03-17 06:59:45
Oh well if that's the total cost then obviously it'll be profitable.

Exactly, most of the people from those countries don't have the luxury to spend their time researching Bitcoin. They have to walk to get their water, or wait in line for their milk.
Now let's say you do get Bitcoin. Now what? It's not easy to buy and sell things IRL in the first world for Bitcoin yet, much less those. The only possible reason they would hold Bitcoin is to save your money from inflation. 
But these people need that money actively to survive. And add to the fact language barriers, technological barriers, the fact that people in 3rd world countries are always lured by mega corporations into scams (and they can do nothing about it), not even stable/secure electricity much less internet, virus-loaded PC's (coming from the blackhat world I can tell you at least 80% of Brazil is in a botnet, possibly similar figures for Venezuela).
 
It just doesn't make sense yet. But that'll change in 5 years.

Hearn was clever to see that problem, and it still exists today. A single Bitcoin mining pool could overtake Bitcoin Cash and none of it's miners would ever find out. It would be highly profitable and there wouldn't be anything illegal about it. Not only Bitcoin Cash, but any other crypto backed by a SHA-256 algorithm.

As a programmer and a futurist the idea of Bitcoin excites me and I really do believe it has a big place in the future. But saying that theirs an impending financial crash and that people should put all their money into Bitcoin is just disengenous and it's what turns the general public away from cryptos -_- .

Throughout the entire article all I read is ETF's are doom, people who are investing in the market are silly, but we're okay cause we've got crypto.

Sorry sure, Dart is a great new technology, lots of documentation, backed by big G etc but I'd be reluctant to use it because of how ridiculously high-level it is and how buggy it (still) might be. 
Nevertheless, it's a good tool for cross platform stuff like this. If not the best tool we have ATM maybe, (depending on your preference). Still, it feels very hack-y.

As a webdev/front end/JS programmer I was thinking of making an app much like this, having ran many ventures similar to this before.
The only thing that concerns me is that now I'm dealing with people's actual money, and wallets. 
Good luck. And I'm sorry that you have to use Dart. I know why you're using it, but I'm very very sorry. At least Google has good documentation.
