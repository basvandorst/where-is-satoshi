(This of course assumes any dealer smart enough to take BTC is also smart enough to HODL at least part of the sale proceeds on some level for some period of time)

If I were to buy a car with bitcoin I would assume the upper hand. 
I would want one ordered for me exactly as I want configured from the factory (not out of your stock). 
I would want A-plan pricing (minus holdback and advertising as specified), all dealer incentives, and zero doc fees or any other type of fees.
You make absolutely ZERO on this deal — because you are, after all, going to profit way way more on my payment method than on the actual sale. 
Right? :)

That’s awesome. I hope my response didn’t come across as arrogant. I was just trying to run the scenario where I, personally, would actually pay in BTC vs just negotiating a cash deal, selling at Gemini or another easier exchange, and just wire you funds. I would need a sweet sweet deal on my end knowing I am parting with some hard earned and invested BTC. I wouldn’t expect you to make zero per se but very close to it since I would have the opportunity cost of my now long gone BTC on my mind for a while. 
Side note: I did actually make a real estate transaction for 4.79 BTC this past fall.  I needed a short term rental of a property at a very very popular summer vacation resort for the 2018 season. On a chance, a random question to the owners out of the blue showed they accepted BTC, and I jumped on it. Money paid. Lease signed. 
Looking back, I now could have rented that same property for the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 seasons in cash. 
We need to address these exact scenarios before we start using crypto in everyday life. Because this can’t keep happening and it’ll never be a “currency” as envisioned. For exactly the same reasons I just stated about the rental property. 
That said, I have enough BTC that if I needed a new Ford and I could get a deal to give me the pricing I was thinking above, I’d make the deal again no problem. 
Just food for thought all around. 
Quick question:  how do you determine exchange rate? For my property rental I just printed a screen shot of Coinbase.com to PDF (which I don’t even use) and emailed it to them the same time I transferred the BTC to their wallet)

 Don’t sell it. Take a tax free loan against it and keep your capital. Bank transfer deposit overnight.

If it went back to $1,200 *I WOULD* remortgage my house to buy more.

It’s also not a taxable event because you’re not liquidating your bitcoin — their holding it as custodian for you.

Guys guys guys. Don’t cash out anymore. Just get a loan on your BTC and keep your capital. Leverage it.

Unless you’re of the belief that bitcoin will not go up more than 16% a year it’s actually a no-brainer.
