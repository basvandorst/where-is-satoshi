Given your concerns, it seems like **you** would be the best person to answer them, depending on how well you know your wife and the nature of your relationship.
I guess that's not what you were looking for, but I have no clue what your wife is like.

Litecoin is not a fork of the bitcoin chain.

Comes across as a bit arrogant, but I suppose that is your goal.
We should all be wary of forced changes that only maximize profits for miners in the short term. Thanks for the write up.
(edit: i'm not sure what i originally said actually makes sense)

Yes, and by opening port 8333 (look elsewhere in this thread for notes).
You can check that your node is on the network here:

PSA: pretty much everyone already capable of running a bitcoin full node could also run a litecoin node. Setup is almost identical (port 9333) and the chain is under 10 GB right now.
Let's scale together!

There's more info here: 
In this case, many of us are more concerned with the politics of how 2x is being pushed, rather than the 2x itself. They're not using the typical open source software channels to communicate with other developers, but they are claiming that their fork should completely replace the existing chain.

Satoshi:0.15.0.1 for me, too. Also a full litecoin node. litecoin is the only "2x" we need.

Please label your axes.
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:14:06
Done (0.15.0.1)
FYI you can check the status of your node here to make sure it's actually connecting correctly

In addition, you need to verify for every transaction that the source user/wallet/address actually has the money they're trying to spend. This is called the UTXO, and gets more expensive to validate as it grows in size (2x blocks will make this bigger, one of the reasons core believes N * x blocks will lead to decentralization because nodes get more expensive to run).
Beyond that, there is the initial setup which downloads the full chain and validates every block on the chain.

You're missing the big picture. Agreed that if a PoW change were to happen, it would need a huge amount of advance notice and a transition plan for everyone. But this could be done constructively - for example on the timescale that everyone would replace their miners to a new model anyway.
There are major problems with the current centralization of bitcoin, and I do believe that they were not originally predicted given the hashing algorithm chosen. If a PoW change makes bitcoin healthier and more decentralized going forward, let's do it as constructively as possible.

Liquidity is just fine for a healthy market. Plenty of others were able to pick up BTC because of this.

I don't see a single reference or citation in that article. Am I just missing it?
