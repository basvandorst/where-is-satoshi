You dont see the wider picture, you cant expect that average users will adopt Bitcoin without things like this. To be honest, i dont like Coinbase, i hate current monetary system and im huge crypto maximalist but this is one of the things that will help crypto mainstream and adoption. I know initialy Bitcoin was desigend to be global currency but right now its also store of value and if we want people use it to buy coffe in countries where coffe is around 1$ we need a LN layer or something like this.

Most of 100% premined alts are pump and dump schemes. Theres no such thing like new Bitcoin. Yes most of Alts will be dead when whole supply from team, exchanges and VC investors end up in hands of small people. People make mistakes searching new Bitcoin in alts. There is only one Bitcoin and he still has a huge space to grow.

Alts are not at the bottom, there is a huge ride until they come to bottom, most alts are crazy overpriced.

eventually everone will do this, ALTS are overpriced and 99% of them will continue to fall long term

Tone Vays is almost always right but the problem is people dont understand his words. Was Bitcoin looking bearish at 5K? I would say yes, did this changed when we hit 13K? Again yes.

I belive dominance will soon come to +90%

Some people like to gamble with leverage. This is a hard way to learn house will always win since they are able to see the cards and drive the price where they want to in order to win the game.

Theres no more real resistance for botcoin, TA dont work anymore on this higher levels.

Most Bitcoin holders hold throug whole 2018 that was pain in the ass, through that time people started to understand what Bitcoin true value is and a lot of people are now not concerned for daily movements since we know we are going to 100K. Will that be in few months or few years, who cares.

It seams to me that someone missed to load BTC bags on time and hope Fibonacci can help, well Fibonacci cant help when we have Fidelity and Bakkt coming on board soon and everyone know it will blow up soon to new ATH.

Agreeed, I saw this video before and he has the point.
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:11:45
50k? I will not even consider start selling under 100k

Does Etoro trade physical bitcoins or only cash contracts? I think we should talk more about all this advertising platforms taking advandage Bitcoin popularity and pretending investing in cash contracts is the same like investing in Bitcoins. I just hate cash futures and cant wait Bakkt futures contracts since they are backed with physical bitcoins.
