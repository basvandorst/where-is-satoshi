A visa card only costs $10 a year (sometimes free), I can spend that much on fees for just a few transactions

And you think block size will double overnight if they limit is raised?
@_date: 2017-06-13 05:45:42
No because they get to play the victim
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:20:21
No it wouldn't, there would be one inputs from one address regardless of how many transactions have been sent to that address 
@_date: 2017-06-12 05:31:49
Because of EU rules, they have to cover the costs other banks charge when their customer users another bank's ATMs. So they simply pass this cost to customers in other ways, like this.

and has blocks every 2.5 minutes so its really 4x that
@_date: 2017-06-07 04:14:31
If you sent it to the same address their would be no extra unspent outputs
@_date: 2017-06-07 04:17:08
Nodes would reject the tx because they see it as a double spend

Who's proposing 400MB blocks?
@_date: 2017-06-07 04:19:25
Not if you didn't bother to check the address anyway like OP
@_date: 2017-06-21 04:22:59
If that was true, you would see more orphaned blocks as the block size increased. Which is not true, look at the data from when the block sizes were around 0.5M to now.
