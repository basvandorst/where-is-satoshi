Yeah.. one obvious flaw in this plan is that governments can print passports.. but I think you could get around this at least to some extent by connecting to nodes that were using passports issued from different countries.. of course nation states still have vast resources to get fake passports from other countries but realistically they could very easily take control of a large mining pool too so.. it could work and might not be any worse than mining in it's current form.

It isn't.. I guess I just introduced it :)

Yes that seems to be what Hearn had in mind.

No it doesn't.. it has nothing to do with linking passports to transactions.. just to bitcoin nodes. And actually it doesn't even link passports to nodes it just links a proof that the node owner owns a unique passport to the node (without revealing the node owner's actual passport information).
It's a replacement for proof-of-work/mining (although I think Mike plans to use it as well as mining - since he's talking about bitcoin rather than a new altcoin). The idea is that you can then connect to say 8 nodes and verify that they are actually run by 8 different people and not all the same guy who's MITMing your internet connection.

I didn't see that discussion.. I guess that once people become accustomed to scanning their passport to run applications many apps will start demanding it.. I can just imagine windows installer prompting for my passport :p
I think enough people will not want their passports linked to payment transactions that there will always be a good cryptocurrency option that doesn't tie your passport to the payment transactions.
I don't really see a major downside to taking advantage of passports to prevent sybil attacks though. It could be the basis for a new altcoin that doesn't need any mining.. you could perhaps even leverage it to get a more 'even' initial coin distribution (ie, you run a node with a unique passport and get say 10000 passport coins).

It's an interesting idea.. instead of using mining for transaction order consensus basically nodes would vote on the ordering and sign their votes using a passport.. that way in order to 51% attack the network an attacker would need to get a whole lot of passports from somewhere. Maybe a concept that could work for an altcoin.. it would probably be useless against a government sponsored attack though.. you could perhaps require a certain percentage of passports from each country vote a certain way to at least require nation level collusion.
