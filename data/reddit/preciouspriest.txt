Regardless of which “$1000” you spent.. you will pay tax on $1000 gain

I heard he forgot his password
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:44:10
Myspace was huge back in the day.. looks like we’re on the way
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:43:04
Its a start up.. they want you more than you do
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:42:06
Damn 5K is a lot of money hope things work out
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:01:05
question is would you be able to wait 3 years if needed again?
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:51:21
Why do you want to cancel order so late?
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:18:14
Legal tender means backed by the government. Well no shit thats the point of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:44:48
How do you know?
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:24:33

@_date: 2018-01-01 22:45:02
Where’s the proof?
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:06:01
I heard he forgot his password
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:17:39
You can’t be an early adopter when your grandma knows what Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:53:28
There is no such thing as Bitcoin Core.. its Bitcoin period.
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:50:33
That is normal.. this is why you always transfer the USD wait 10 days and THEN buy BTC instantly so you can panic sell if needed.
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:38:46
The banks found out who he was and took him out
@_date: 2018-01-15 04:02:08
Damn this hit me hard.. and I don’t know why
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:14:54
The writers over at cnbc can catch these hands. HODL
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:55:53
Why did you sell?
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:45:25
Where was I during all this??
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:42:14
They bascially saved you your money. Blessing in disguise.

@_date: 2017-12-23 20:07:08
youre gonna wanna probably put it in a vending machine
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:09:31
Depends on how much you trust the trust
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:02:32
Not too sure how I feel about that stinky cheese sauce
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:55:34
Looks like they accidently rolled out their sandbox environment 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:22:45
My dumps never fail, always clogs the system.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:01:05
You are the hero bitcoin needs
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:51:47
I dont think they fully even know what bitcoin is
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:10:51
This is reddit 
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:38:59
Seems like a dumb opinion but you are entitaled
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:38:54
Main stream media only care about extremes. Extreme gains and extreme drops. Anything in the middle doesn’t exsist.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:44:25
Is jumper another word for sweatshirt? Hoodie?
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:13:59
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:30:05
of course not
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:04:40
takes a fraud to know a fraud
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:57:10
I’d rather give my coins away for free than buy Shitcash
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:21:46
bought at 16.2k we’ll be alright buddy boy. And if not we will sink together *salute*
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:38:25
Fake story
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:46:24
fact that you said “eat AT chiken biryani” made you look like a clueless dumbass
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:50:21
coinbase has been open and people have exited as they please
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:26:10

@_date: 2017-12-23 03:09:15
Bitcoin is one coin to rule them all.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:32:00
beginning of what
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:41:29
Bottoms up!
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:26:56
Its almost my bed time though? :(
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:19:05
Something doesn’t add up. You don’t lose a bitcoin by trading. You might have lost some value after selling but if you lost the whole coin for nothing I think you don’t have any brain cells.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:45:50
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:09:05
Dropped 1k in a half hour just as I had gotten a bit of hope
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:59:28
Bitcoin is Cristopher Columbus.. A future Alt will be George Washington. There is nothing wrong with this.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:18:55
never zoom out, only in
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:42:30
you think thats frustrating? wait until you see how long it takes for funds to be available
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:08:47
Coinbase is having more problems than just liquidity
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:01:35
Roger that
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:08:01
yes it will but it will need to be accepted first before a competitor even comes close and for it to be accepted worldwide it will hit value much higher than 50k. You are right but also you dont understand how wrong you are.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:27:33
Has to do with their government possibly impossing impossibly high taxes on crypto gains. Would google for details.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:04:45
Might as well say “How to be a shitty investor”
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:42:43
it cant be a bubble and have popped at the same time
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:44:03
becaust bitcoin is not a stock. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:40:23
Thats a nice dinner and a movie you can now feel less bad about. Congrats its all about small victories.

The grinch that stole Crypto
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:50:55

There will always be large swings, its how investing works
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:49:20
HODL is more than a movement, its a lifestyle
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:25:51
HODL or bust

Ensure your seat belt is firm fastened as you are in for one hell of a ride
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:24:11
When’s the fork?
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:15:51
You my friend are a pioneer, a visionary, the christopher columbus of our time. Let this be an example for others to follow.

Crypto is so volatile, this headline is obsolete and we’re already back to 15k
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:37:47
You havent made money yet because you havent posted about this in all your social media accounts and brought it up in every conversation with anyone you’ve had since. Try this and profits x500000
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:54:21
Dont rush.. youll save yourself a lot of frustration by waiting for the bank transfer rather than having money just straight up disappear and waiting
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:31:29
Someone verify this claim before we all go crazy.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:32:36
you forgot an extra zero
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:12:32
They tell you right on the confirmation page what the fee is. Not too sure how much you were playing around if you hit buy and confirm without reading anything.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:44:44
Reform a line! 
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:06:59
Sounds interesting.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:19:53
because coinbase

Captain Obvious seems to reside in Chicago it seems
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:31:03
Smart move. Dumb move wouldve been to sell and walk away.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:13:43
They are as safe as they would be in a checking account
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:24:09
Gemini &gt; Coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:23:36
This post made me lose any remining brain cells I had. If you invest your college fund into bitcoin rather than going to school, you need to reevaluate your life.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:48:35
10 years is tioo short of a time frame for anything drastic
