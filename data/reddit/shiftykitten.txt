We had a drastic rise in the past few months fueled by new comers. Many of them have not heard this old fud so they fall for it. They sell into the dips.

Im happy fiat is working out for you. I’m sure it was working out just fine in Cyprus before all banks closed in 2013 to stop people from withdrawal. I’m sure it was also fine in India in 2016 right up until it’s government said it’s two biggest denomination bills were no longer valid. A country that mostly used paper bills and gold. I’m also sure maybe it will still be ok when the US decides to say it’s paper money is no longer worth anything. I’m sure you’ll still be ok with them then imposing negative interest rates on all accounts. Don’t think this is possible? Have a look at Zimbabwe or even Venezuela. Ask them how bitcoin is any good to them as they must be rolling in money. If they are doing so well then why can one buy a 100 trillion dollar bill for less than $20? Then again maybe the US should just print a 50 trillion dollar bill and pay of its debt.

There will be steps forward and some steps backwards. Bitcoin is still comparable to the internet in 93-94. People are starting to hear about it. Most have no idea what it is. Those that are using it get pissed off when their sibling picks up the phone and makes the modem drop connection. There is much software to develope for mass adoption.

Be happy you don’t have to deal with banks, I do and they are terrible. 
Try buying a firearm with PayPal. Try selling something with PayPal and have the buyer claim they never received it. 
Walk into a bank and withdraw 2-5k cash. Try it one day. They will hold you there for almost an hour while they dance around the fact that they don’t have it. Eventually they make a few phone calls while gathering as much info about you as possible. Eventually they may show up with the cash as asked or tell you to visit another bank.

All examples of government controlled monies. If printing money was designed to keep the economy running it should be given directly to the poor and middle class. When it’s printed it’s given to banks and used as loans that include interest. Who’s benefiting from this interest, the bank? In none of these examples do they include an actual currency that was deflationary. Where’s the examples where gold was used exclusively? You see Bitcoin is the most sound example of money that mankind has ever known. Gold comes close but can be mined from other planets. Gold is also hard to split and carry.

All an attacker needs to do is call your phone company and say he’s swapping your sim. If the first agent doesn’t do it he calls back and eventually one does this for him. He’s now got your cell phone. Now he uses this to change your email passwords and or exchange passwords. He can then use your email to see what accounts you have. If you didn’t have text 2FA set up on your phone the attacker would have to brute force your passwords which is much harder. Your best bet is to use an authentication app. They are less convenient but much more secure. Just make sure to save your backup seed so you don’t lock yourself out with a lost or upgraded phone.

Printing money is only a fraction of the problem. Fractional reserve lending is the larger issue. It’s essentially printing money by journal entry. If we could stop that too we would be on path to a real recovery. We also need to curb government spending. When I say that I mean cuts, real cuts. Not some “we were going to allocate 5million more next year but we’ll only allocate 4.5million more, therefore cutting .5 million”. By that thinking we still end up with a 4.5 mil increase. Problem is our gov is addicted to spending and printing. Our bankers who should have been behind bars since 08 have been bailed out monetarily for their mistakes and the middle class had to pay for it all.

No. Net neutrality is the equivalent to free speech. Dropping net neutrality would allow isps to charge heavily for the content they don’t want you to see and give you the free content they want you to see. Picture a world in which one would have to pay $15 a week to access r/bitcoin but r/cats would be free. Net neutrality stops this. Bitcoin remains unaffected with or without net neutrality though.

Everytime the shitcoin pumps there is a influx of sock puppet accounts complaining about fees and transaction times. They also litter the sub with FUD articles in hopes of driving down the price. Pump the shit coin until no further rise and then dumps profits into BTC which has suffered a drop in price. Rinse and repeat. Sadly it seems like it works so it won’t be stopping anytime soon. Lightning network should stop the spamming of the mempool or at least stop it from working as well as it does now. Nothing new here really.

Someone needs a reason to loan out their coins. They loan them out with the intention of getting more of them when paid back.
Shorts bring the price down, however if buyers like the lower price they will buy. So it’s never really x happens so expect y.

In order to have a short position someone must take the long position. The person who would short bitcoin to take the win on the short position will have equal and opposite reaction by the person going long. If one of them hits the circuit breaker then the trade stops.

This is why I posted the above comment. Traders will be working against one another and both have the interest of keeping any change in the actual bitcoin price below a 7% gain or above a 7% loss. If anything at all it will smooth out some of the volatility. If a “well coordinate sell-off” does occur and drops the price 20% then the futures trade is cancelled. 20% gains/losses are currently normal events. I don’t see a problem with futures.

Moving the market 8% would trigger circuit breakers and their trades would halt for a short time.

Coinbase has a terrible wallet for fees. Couple this with network spam because miners are jumping between most profitable coins. I’d suggest mailing Coinbase and ask them to implement segwit. The fees once they have segwit available will be pennies to send that same transaction.

Instead of blocking them, how about express lanes. Hear me out, miners dedicated to finding these specific transactions and only these transactions. You see it’s likely miners who are making these spam transactions and they continue because they get the fees from them. Well what if they don’t get the fees from them? What if their spam was picked up by these few miners who’s sole job is to find a process these transactions? I don’t know if this is probable but certainly a different way of thinking about it.

Short is when you borrow an asset and sell it with the hopes it will go down in price. Once price goes down you buy back in and pay back the borrowed asset with interest and keep the remaining as profit.

It’s hard to find a truly air gapped pc, a usb, clean OS, and a dumb printer that has not, and more importantly will never be online in the future.

They’re are plenty of vulnerabilities when reusing a paper wallet private key. If you type your private key on anything there is a chance a key logger could pick it up. If you scan a QR with your phone there is a chance this information could be obtained. If your only using it for small amounts maybe it’s ok, but you’d lessen your security with each use. You’d be much safer with a wallet app on a phone then to reuse a paper wallet.

There was Bitcoin with 1 mb blocks. Some miners wanted to keep using asic boost and also larger blocks. Many users just wanted segwit. Many users showed force by creating a user activated soft fork to implement segwit. There was also back room deals to make segwit with larger blocks but they failed. In the end consensus won and segwit was activated. Miners got pissed cause the couldn’t cheat any longer so they forked off with larger blocks without giving enough thought into development. Since inception they have had to fork their own coin to fix an emergency difficulty adjustment. Their coin was in a death spiral. Now Bitcoin has implemented segwit and lightning network so there really isn’t a need at all for bcash. Except maybe to pump and dump and to run asic boost.

Sign up. Give them all KYC/AML information. They approve you or decline. Once approved they give you an account. You have to find this information on your account page (don’t know exact location.)
Print this form and submit to your employer with a chosen percentage of your paycheck to be deposited each pay period. Then in setup give your Bitcoin address to Bitwage. You can use a master PUBLIC key so each address is different. You can also submit many addresses on your own. Basically you get paid and the percentage goes into the Bitwage account.

Calculate out to 10 years and try to support your claims.

A solid step in the right direction. Cut it 100% now and we’ll see a new world super power in 10-15 years.

If I hand you a dollar vs Monopoly money are you going to have enough knowledge to know which one is the real token? Bcash offers no fix of any worth. It’s got a loud salesman who had enough money to employ plenty of sock puppets and wash trading bots. It looks like there is usage but most of it is fake. They are also having a fork soon so there is some legitimate buys in order to get coins on both forks and dump them soon as they can.
I wouldn’t worry about it, his desperation is beginning to show.

I like the idea but as another user pointed out I’m not linking my Twitter account.

High fees were caused by Coinbase not adopting Segwit and not batching transactions. Once they started batching the fees dropped to reasonable rates.

People are often worried about how much the Fed is printing. The true problem is the banks writing loans on money they don’t have (fractional reserve lending). Loaning $90,000 because they have $10,000 on hand. The 90k gets paid back and then they write another loan for $1,000,000. This now created money out of thin air. Plus interest of course.

Get really good at origami and make her a paper wallet bracelet. It’s up to you if you want to make it worth more than the gold she’s wearing or not.

All those you listed still can not do what OP did with the lightning tip. He knows nothing about you, has no account number for you, nor any idea where in the world you are. Yet he transferred value directly to you. Irreversibly with no ones permission. Instantly. 
Powerful stuff really.

Your forgetting how determined Frank over there is with his doomsday bunker. Food for 75 years. Water treatment powered by geothermal nuclear whatever. Hidden in each corner a node connected to the net. One via satellite, one via text messages, one via carrier pigeon. Outlandish I know, but my point is that even being chucked back 1000 years some crazy guy will have a copy of the ledger hidden somewhere. Here’s the silver lining. This guy Frank, there’s many like him.

Thank you. I’m love seeing Lightning in use! From all the talk about it to it’s infancy. It’s come a long way in these last few months!
