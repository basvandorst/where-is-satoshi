I just ran a test on my laptop. I can run about 39 Mega hashes per second. Over the course of a month, that'll earn me about a quarter (as in, 25 cents). To really mine, you'll need special equipment (ASICs), or buy shares in ASIC pools. 
It comes down to good mining **hardware**, not software. Sorry.

People think it's a scam if it's new and too good to be true. Don't start out with opinions or potential. Start with facts. Point out that it's 5 years old, hundreds of merchants like Overstock and Gyft accept it, and point to the positive November Senate hearings. Also throw in somewhere that though it's open-source and the financial incentive to hack and steal the bitcoins is enormous (on the order of billions), the blockchain code has never been hacked. But don't be too long winded.
Drawbacks: Exchanges have been hacked. Also, volatility and ease of loss involving keys. Address how these can be mitigated.

1. It's open source, worth billions, and has been out over 5 years. If there was a hole in it, it would have been exploited by now. Because of the **huge** financial incentive to hack it, you can reasonably expect people have been trying. The protocol is yet to be hacked (though exchanges have).
2. Have him explain fiat, then ask him why debt-backed paper is all that. Also, bitcoin is everywhere. It's a ledger copied on many computers. "Sending" bitcoin isn't really sending, as it's more along the lines of changing who is allowed to access the coins. The bitcoin stays in the blockchain, but if I "send" you a few milibits, then suddenly it's your private key that can access it, not mine. 
3. QR code is like a barcode. It's just a way to encode information in a scannable way. Public keys are an address that everyone can see, like a bank account number. Private keys allow you to spend the public keys, like a PIN for a debit card.
4. Anyone can mine it in the same way anyone can mine gold. But at this point you're unlikely to generate much. The difficulty is much too high for an average computer.  You're also unlikely to dig up gold in your backyard.

I've bought a few things here and there. But I pre-buy more bitcoin before spending. Ex, if I want a $50 Red Robin card, I'll buy $50 worth of BTC, and while that's confirming, use the BTC I already have via gyft. No loss of bitcoin, and I'm contributing to the commerce.

There's more than one factor controlling large-scale things like jobs, not just inflation, not just taxes, etc. Personally I don't see why you couldn't control it and hold it close to or slightly above neutral (I'm an engineer, not an economist).
Let's say, for whatever reason, I want to leave my grandchildren $20,000 in spending money 50 years from now. Let's also say I don't trust institutions to not crash, nor do I trust the government to not heavily tax it. Due to 2% inflation, I'd have to put over $53,000 "under the bed" for it to be worth $20,000 in the future due to 2% inflation. [Over a 60% loss!]( Even if I put it into a CD as a low risk investment, it's still losing money. How is this fair?

I was required to provide my birth certificate, among other documents, prior to beginning with an accredited school. This was back in 2004-2005.

EDIT: [Here's a video]( of someone buying Bitcoin. To sell:
* Select how much money you want in multiples of $20 or $100
* The machine will display a QR receive address and amount of BTC to send to it. It will then print that receive QR and a Redemption code on a paper ticket.
* Get on your smart phone, and send the money to that receive address, and wait for one confirmation. Other people can use the machine in the meantime.
* Go back to the machine with the ticket, scan the redeem code on its QR reader, and get your money. Easy!
My only issue is, the smartphone is like a middle man when it comes to selling.

Here's my thinking: To make the math easy, let's say Bitcoin is at 500 even. I split that Bitcoin into ten paper wallets, each 100 mBTC being worth $50. The private key associated with that $50 has never seen any other funds. If I lose it or someone dishonest steals it, it's not that big of a loss in the bigger picture. 
Am I wrong in this thinking?

I like to think of it more like this:
"Bitcoin is incredibly cool! It's so new though, that currently the only physical manifestation we have of it is this expensive ATM; we recommend you try it!" 
I do want to make one example. Like other users have echoed here, **none** of the problems with this ATM, with any other ATM, with any exchange, or with any payment processor, are the fault of Bitcoin. It's like someone blaming the internet as a whole for their horrible experience when using AOL.

Hmm, no, let me try to refine my wording. I'm thinking one-time wallets.
* I go into a store with a 50 dollar bill. I spend it and get 40 dollars worth of goods and 10 dollars of change back. Transaction complete, bill no longer mine.
* I go into a store with a [golden ticket]( worth $50 dollars. I have the merchant import or swipe the key into their merchant address. I get 40 dollars worth of goods and 10 dollars of change back. If they steal the private key, it's their loss completely as I already have what I need.
@_date: 2013-12-28 05:12:55
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:33:45
That's one implementation if it, and a great idea too! As long as the merchant selling them is reputable or can prove lack of access to the keys it sells, it could work. 
But then, only if QR readers in person accepted the import/swipe method, which goes back to my original post.
