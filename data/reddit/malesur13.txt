First this. The transaction from non-SegWit to SegWit is a non-SegWit transaction, so you will pay a higher fee to do so, especially if you want to be in the first block. Once you transfer from SegWit to SegWit or non-SegWit it is a SegWit tx.
Last weekend I made a SegWit transaction to an exchange into first block for $11.
My advice: move the funds during downtimes, which is mostly in weekends, and put the fee lower, as in first 6 blocks or so.

That chuckle after "you think we have volume in bitcoin?" gets me everytime.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:52:52
Once everyone on the planet will use multiple transactions each day, or the possibility of streaming money, will never be possible just by increasing block size, but will be with layers. Also increase of block size could centralize miners due to the equipment needed to keep running a fullnode.

What happens if the price goes down?
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:38:24
But in the end a lot more volume means a higher market cap thus a higher price per coin? Or does it just mean more volume in buy and sell?

Hope so so I can buy more cheap. Once the technology is ready for mass addoption.... Exciting times ahead of us either way!

Step 1. Decide the amount you are willing to put in each month, and that you can afford to loose. Also decide to put in money weekly, every 2 weeks or monthly. Weekly costs more fees but could potentially be more "safe".
Step 2. Set a timer for each time you plan to buy.
Step 3. Buy at set time, not looking at the price.
Step 4. Continue step 1-3 for one year.
Step 5. After one year look back and smile.

Do you think the 200B market cap is filled with wallstreet money? Isnt it supposed to be much higher first before it can be dumped?
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:34:11
Trading stops after 7% pump or dump so i doubt massive shorting will happen.
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:46:02
Only $12m left

Replaced "is the price low" with: still have fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:31:29
Only the thought or angst that futures could possibly result in people shorting is enough for people to sell and make for a dip. Even without any shorting action. Warning people about this only fuels this sentiment. Don't worry too much and keep buying more.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:13:44

The positive news on lightning network, which has the potential of making some alt coins obsolete.

Change subject to "Risk for fiat" and you will have a lot more to say. In all seriousness: watch YouTube/user/aantonop for some very objective, informative topics on cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:01:21
Ask yourself also what would happen if it takes over 10 minutes to globally synchronise blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:59:45
Your arguments are valid and is one of the reasons people support Bitcoin Cash. However the Core devs have chosen to work on layering first, and increasing blocks later if needed. I am no dev and just entered a month ago. Watch the start of this video for an in depth explanation:

@_date: 2017-12-06 17:09:15
Only been really interested in crypto for like four weeks. What a year it has been. All doubts washed away when I stumbled upon Andreas youtube videos. Objective, informative, polite, intelligent and humble information about this exciting space. Thank you for all you have done and for all you will do in the future. I felt anger reading yesterdays tweet from someone who had a prominent role in this space, lashing out to andreas. To me you should not feel obliged or committed to defend yourself so openly like you did. However I am happy to hear all positive reactions. For all it is worth I would like to thank you again. You are my crypto man crush I never thought I would have. Something I hope I never have to explain to my wife :). Much love and please keep doing what you are doing.

A linear solution wont help an exponential problem. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:40:51
Would u prefer implementing a not thoroughly tested solution (lightning network) today, endangering the entire trust in the network? Or will you be patient while 100s of very smart people all around the world are working 24/7 on solving this problem. These devs have seen this problem coming years ago and the solution is almost here.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:57:52
Some people should go back to school and learn about exponential growth.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:14:36
Bithump coinone and korbit. I always check  and click BTC price.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:02:47
Simplified: first coin and a lot of smart people working on long term solutions. Devs who understand for this technology to work you need layers and not just block size increase. (For it to become a global currency it needs to be able to support exponential growth. Exponential growth of block size (BCH) or faster blocks (LTC) will result in problems in the long run, off chain layers like lightning and who knows 2nd and 3rd layers down the line will hopefully be able to).
Also: proof of work vs proof of stake. Some believe you need proof of stake. There will be other succesfull coins in the long run and who knows one will ultinately overtake BTC, but only if they serve a different purpose or really add something unique that BTC can't add.

If you are afraid whales will short, why would you want to sell to them? Personally I will hold. Remember for each short someone should be on long side. Miners will have good reasons to take a short position. Why wont whales both invest and take long position for double gains? 300 B market cap is nothing for whales, plus it is a global bull run why risk losing?
Tl.Dr: noone knows what will happen. If you dont want to risk the amount of value u have in BTC right now, consider withdrawal today.

If it was valued as a major player why is the market cap only 200-300 billion? It is still very very early game. Which is good. The network isnt ready. Yet.

@_date: 2017-12-08 18:44:20
That is indeed a working short term solution. Sadly long term unsustainable. Andreas Antonopoulos has a great video explaining why the best long term solution is layers.

@_date: 2017-12-05 23:03:34
Interesting read, but demand isnt only high in the US,  demand is also high in Asia, Europe, south america, africa... how would they benefit from shorting futures? Also, of wales are buying now to short later, should the market cap not be a lot higher first before they can really start shorting?
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:52:39
Lagging behind, Korea is already way over 17k
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:31:26
Its all about the scaling debate. For cryptocurrency to be used global you need it to be capable of supporting exponential growth. Increasing block size is a lineair approach but because it is easy and it works it could help early addoption. Off chain solutions, adding layers, once implemented, will be able to support exponential growth. It is not an easy one though that is why it takes some time to implement. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:54
I shit my pants
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:02:47
The assumed benefit for shorting is you can repeat the cycle over and over because you rebuy the coins at lower price you dumped them for. However it is still a huge risk to try and short in a global bull market. The fear for a dip could be of higher influence than any shorting action though.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:22:46
Aand its gone
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:05:27
Is it also related to the volume/ market cap? The higher the volume the harder it is to change the prize, leading to reduced volatility?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:54:52

I am with you. Got into crypto just before november. Read about forks and decided to wait a bit. After 2X cancel I bought hoping for the moon. Now today bought 2nd time but fiat didnt kick in until 7200. But I did buy. Never felt so alive last weekend thinking and doubting about important things in life. But I held. FOR SPARTA! I HEDL. Ps my balls are now twice its size.

I don't see the difference between how it is today. I pay tax on my income and on my expenses. Every year I tell the gvt what I posses and pay taxes over that too. Now I could put my savings not on the bank and not tell. But then I have some explaining to do if I suddenly buy a big house. Small services as well now with cash are done without telling where people not add it to their income.

Comparing Bitcoin with a company shows how clueless a lot of people still are. Compare it to total market value of nation currencies or gold trade makes more sense to me. Also, how much power does a local bank use for its services?
