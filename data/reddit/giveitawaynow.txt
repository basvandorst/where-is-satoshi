It's the one thing I "hate" about die-hard Austrians/Libertarians/etc. The overhead cost of actually transporting gold from one vendor/person to another vendor/person around the world is incredibly high. Replace gold with any other shiny commodity really and the problem still exists.
There's no pragmatic way of doing exchanges with the gold system on a macro level without going back to some form of Gold Certificates (see: Nathan Lewis). BitCoins at least allows people to trade from around the world wherever they are without shlepping pounds/kilos of gold around them.

It's not but that information doesn't really do you any good. No one knows which public keys are owned by which private keys. Wallet.dat is not tied to an IP address, etc. 


No one is evading taxes (you are more than welcome to report your costs towards bitcoins -- using the bitcoins itself has no taxing to begin with -- this is the precise reason why CIA wanted to interview one of bitcoin's leading developers [to understand it more and to see if it poses as a threat]) except the few who *are* (but there are even more ways of doing this than just bitcoins itself).


Drugs shouldn't be illegal in the first place, it does nothing but create black markets, puts innocent people in prison, etc. The war on drugs has been going on for over 40 years now, it's time to stop it and your comment was nothing more than a strawman.

Several reasons (I left these things out so yeah):
1. Ruby has EventMachine (PHP does too but it's got it's problems) and NodeJS is asynchronous by default (it's fast no I/O lock)
2. I'd use NginX over Apache which is faster in 99.9999% instances (including this one)
3. I'd use PGSQL over MySQL (99.9999% instances it's faster)
4. Throw some Redis on that bitch (for market info / polling up API) &lt;-- this can be easily done for PHP too just saying
5. Ruby has way better Module/Namespacing capabilities (since everything is an object) meaning you can extend the functionality of the market in anyway you wish.
And an off reason, generally speaking Ruby devs and NodeJS devs actually know what they're doing unlike PHP counterparts (I've been programming in PHP for over 9 years now professionally for 6, I think I'm pretty qualified to make this statement -- not saying PHP Is a bad language I'm saying the userbase [much in the same way for actual ruby coders and just ruby on rails devs]).

OK so you see a computer priced at $600 right? Well in 8 months, that price drops to $400, 8 months after that $200, and 8 months after that $100. The problem is, you need a computer today (let's assume you can't borrow one [no friends l-o-l], you can't 'rent' one, etc -- if it makes you feel better replace the word computer with bread/food) for a school project otherwise you get an F and this grade is 50% of your final grade. Will you stil horde your BTC under this situation?

Judging on this statement, you're either a socialist or a linguists ;) What I said earlier was you don't have to pay any taxes with BitCoins. It isn't recognized as legal tender (it's literally virtual coins). Which is the primary reason why you can't trade stocks with BitCoins (although would be interesting) amongst other things (like paying taxes in itself with BTC). There's nothing that you're evading from which is my point.


And what exactly makes you think this isn't happening right now? It's funny, a lot of pro socialists and leftists and statists, etc. alllllllllll think that problems can be solved with a snap of a finger (reason being is because they mostly don't know self responsibility nor do they own an actual business/produce). There are already several shops that accept BitCoins, several people are working for bitcoins, you can now purchase domains, webhosting, even mugs using bitcoins. I don't think you realize BitCoins is at it's *infancy* stage. You expect a 4 month old to run a mile? Get. fucking. real.

Wait, how did stimulus packages help us get out of the recession?
Decrease the price of licenses for food vendors, hair cutters, interior designing, taxis, etc. Then watch the economy grow from the bottom up :) Easy jobs often require some sort of license and/or regulation which only hurts the poor more. Getting rid of these regulations and/or licenses would help these individuals vastly more than what any stimulus package can do (especially when you hand out money only to tax it and take it away from them again).

A really easy way to fix this would be to create a bitcoin://&lt;address&gt;/&lt;amount&gt; URL and have the client / additional program that executes a command from bitcoind to send the money (of course it would pop up with a "Are you sure you wish to send &lt;address&gt; &lt;amount&gt;?"

Never said they're going to shut anything down, they're just going to make it illegal for you to exchange it for real legal tender. Our taxes will go up as well to pay for this new service, "It's OK though because it's for our safety!" More auditing, more getting creative. Luckily for us gov't moves sloooooow.
@_date: 2011-02-21 21:20:46
The problem with that is... how would it operate differently? I mean, let's say there's a new currency that's capped at 21,000,000 and goes at the same "speed" as BTC, why would people opt to use that instead of BTC? There would be no benefits and BTC is already way ahead in that scenario.
Now let's say a new currency was made with a different cap and a different "speed", it wouldn't be much different from two commodities competing for each other.
Markets like MtGox, etc. would expand (may be) and adapt to the new virtual currencies. People can pick and choose as they please, but remember.. BTC is already doing this *today*. Which provides a pretty decent advantage.
@_date: 2011-06-22 17:02:32
Here are the reasons why you would choose BTC over USD as a means of exchange:
1. Transfer money over great distances within the internet without having to report anything (paper work costs time, time = money).
2. Anonymous transactions (for whatever the reason -- even other than drugs -- people like a sense of privacy especially if the item in question is questionable material (e.g. sex toys)).
3. No transaction fees and no credit interest rates (this is huge)
4. No taxes (for now, national governments *can* change this but would have no real way of keeping track as to who to tax as explained in one of my previous posts).
If you wish to horde your cash then by all means do so, if you want to use USD then by all means do so, no one is trying to persuade you to use BTC over USD. If you were genuinely interested in the answer you would have oh idk... use a new piece of technology called Google. It's fantastic actually you can even google "Boobies" and get a bunch of pictures of birds! ;)

You've obviously never had to fill out a tax form (may be with the exception of a W-2 LOL even my dog has one of those)


Multiple node entries and the ability to move wallets around makes it completely anonymous. Your lack of technical information is showing here.


What? Enjoy the additional $0.30 + 3.2% transaction fees from PayPal (I lol'd too)


Nothing illegal about virtual currency at the moment. BitCoins is 100% legal :)


Because some vendors will only accept BitCoins as payment? I've already explained to you as to why vendors and businesses would prefer bitcoins over usd (just by the monetary policies not the transaction fees, etc). It's not only a fantastic system (deflationary policies) for vendors but for consumers (what I call "employees") I've written this up somewhere else... (note: this next paragraph might confuse you.. in regards to your last comment "flinging my arms around" just because YOU do not understand does not mean I'm flinging my arms around l-o-l)


When there are inflationary monetary systems existing throughout the world, *of course* you're going to use them over deflationary, consumers get the better deal out of it ($300 PS3 today is $350 tomorrow! [due to a decrease in value]) and on a micro scale this is a GOOD thing, but on a MACRO level you've fucked up (read: National debt, decrease of real value, poverty issues ["Oh wait stimulus can help us!" l-o-l], etc).
If you *still* don't understand than we must end this conversation, as you will need to be come more familiar with economics (any book will do at this point.. hell even Keynes).

@_date: 2011-06-21 19:18:34


As I said, FOR CONSUMERS you will always choose the inflationary monetary policy. FOR VENDORS/MERCHANTS you will want the deflationary monetary policy of exchange. You ALSO have ZERO idea if BTC will be worth higher (could always go down, it was priced @ $30 at one point now it's $15~$17). We could go to speculation and market analysis but we'll have a more productive time in Now, the next question, "Why the hell would I want deflationary monetary policy then? I'm a consumer damnit and I want my pizza!" Reason why deflationary monetary policies work is not on the micro scale but the macro scale. Inflationary = spending to invest, deflationary = invest to spend. We're using the same words in each right-side of the equation but totally different meanings.
For the laymen, deflationary means you'll be making wiser choices when purchasing as oppose to reckless behavior (as evident of mortgages in early 2000s as well as consumption rates throughout most of late American history). Inflation promotes growth in short term cycle and decay over long term cycles. Deflation is the opposite of this.
As for your specific Pizza example, the $10 in BitCoins is worth a little bit more, there are no transaction fees and no taxations (on the currency itself... US could technically regulate this but have no *real* way of knowing if businesses are abiding to this law unless we use more tax money to hire individuals [less unemployment rate to dig up holes and fill them back in yaaaay] to scope out each business that is "registered to use BTC as legal tender".. only saying this as a possibility no factual advice).

It's incredibly cute on how you keep downvoting me here's another link...


Essentially.. while you horde your BTC, it'll only raise my value of BTC and thus increase my purchasing power which means I can invest more with less :) So I'm actually HOPING you'll sit on your money while I produce and expand. :D

@_date: 2011-02-22 07:23:07
And what exactly does that mean..? I don't think you have a full grasp on what BitCoin is (not being a dick just honest). Since we're playing hypotheticals, all is the same except a much wider user base than BTC, the rate at which those other coins are found would be the same. So, for the production viewpoint it would be the same.
But, for the actual market usage of each currency, the wider base would win. This isn't necessarily a bad thing (although could be for those who own BTC) *however* we're also assuming there wouldn't be products and services that allows merchants to accept all forms of virtual currency (the market *would* demand that... I would myself).
But there's also another thing we need to take into account, having a wider base isn't necessarily a good thing especially when the rate of supply remains the same. Higher demand with a lower supply means either one of two things:
1) Many people own small amounts of BTC in which case would be hard to sell goods.
2) Small set of people own large amounts of BTC, which again, would be hard to sell goods.
Technically speaking you'd want an equilibrium of supply and demand (which is why you don't want to grow *too fast*). Thankfully, we have people who are willing to trade within the markets.
@_date: 2011-06-21 03:10:11
I'm not suggesting it's a bad idea to horde now O_o I'm saying the hording problem wont be a problem as the ease of use grows.
gg - take an econ class plz l-o-l
@_date: 2011-06-20 20:56:36


You're assuming BTC wont grow into ease-of-use for some reason... why? Imagine being able to pay for everything with the same amount of value *without the additional cost of having to be taxed* (for the consumer). For the merchant, imagine not having to go sign paper work to go through regulations of accepting credit and/or cash and lower transaction rates (companies like VISA, MC, etc wont hold a state-monopoly).


Lol I already did when i bought in at $0.45 and sold at $30 ;) I'm actually in the process of setting up contractors to develop an easy system to people can use bitcoins irl in an easier way than cash (think similar to a CC/Debit card and not like the BitBucks example). 
As of right now I 100% agree with you that USD will be used over BTC *right now*, but this most certainly doesn't mean it can change.
@_date: 2011-03-23 01:02:29
Hypothetically, what would happen if someone stole your wallet IRL?
The only thing you can do.. is use a secure operating system, firewall, anti-virus, don't download anything weird, etc.
Now if there's two of the same wallets on the network, then there *might* be something where the computers will only talk to the first one. Not sure how that would work though (it's a torrent network).

Ah didn't know that, awesome and thans :D
@_date: 2011-06-20 18:40:46
* This is a bit of a long answer... there's a big bolded paragraph that only needs to be read in order to understand why a deflationary system, over the long haul, helps more so than hurts the economy and everyone involved. As of right now there is no **real** reason to using USD over BTC but that is from the merchant's end not the consumers.*


OK I'll spell it out a bit clearer for you (assuming from this question you have probably read a maximum of 2 econ books and that was only to get an A in class). Even though a commodity/item/etc. will devalue over time you'll still *need* that item **today**. Meaning, hoarding will not happen (as often as we like to originally believe). And as any *real* capitalist knows hoarding any form of currency (be it USD in the bank or BTC in wallet.dat) doesn't do anything (you want to capital risk). In an inflationary system, spending = investing (which is bad), in a deflationary system investing becomes the spending (which is good always promotes growth). Initially an inflationary system will promote growth (surplus money supply) but eventually it comes to a halt and over excesses on consumption (see: USA). 


If the following conditions where met:
1. There was a limited supply in WC gold (WC gold = inflationary / USD system ;))
2. If there was an accurate exchange market for WC gold and USD
3. If Blizzard allowed WC gold to be xsfered into USD
4. If the merchant/vendor accepted WC gold as a form of currency for the laptop
5. I actually played WC and felt as if the amount of time required to get said gold (for the laptop) 
Then yes (in reality of terms.. WC gold and USD are worth the same [they both aren't backed up by anything other than the rate at which the government [Fed/Blizzard] supplies the currency to the economy]).
Assuming you had BTC and USD and assuming the store/vendor accepted both USD and BTC the *only* reason why you'd use USD over BTC is because you know USD will devalue itself quicker than BTC would (which explains the problem with USD in itself). Essentially, vendors would have to just adopt BTC as a form of payment, the reason being is that the US gov't can very easily tax you through hyper inflation...here I'll explain all of this using a very easy to understand metaphor...
**JUST READ THIS PART: Deflationary monetary policies are good for legs/supports (merchants) for the bridge (community/world). The consumer gets shafted the most out of this equation, but remember, spending != investing [the way you WANT TO believe right now... I know I know it's a very foreign concept to grasp]. You will think twice before purchasing consuming goods and make wiser choices rather than devastating ones (e.g. House mortgages in early 2000) and in the end, as a whole, have a system in which encourages growth and investing over consumption and decaying.**
