Ok, any ideas what could be causing my error? I am able to manually adjust the fee in the coinb.in Spend Multisignature P2SH prompt, so im curious what you mean by the fee cant be changed?

When I enter the raw transaction info into the verify prompt, it registers and shows the right info, I go to click Submit, and nothing happens. 
My mouse registers theres a button there, but when I hit the button it doesnt actually process the info..
Here's what it says:
Transaction Script
The above script has been decoded
Version: 1
Transaction Size: 340 bytes
Lock time: 0
The TXID is filled in, the 'N' (index ID of the transaction) is 0 ((is this a problem?)), the Script code is filled in, under SIGNED it says 2 with a black check, under MULTISIG it says 2/3
Under ADDRESS it has my destination address, the paid Amount (minus the .0005 fee), and the SCRIPT code box is filled in 
Any thoughts?
Also, this may be a rudimentary question, but this whole time ive thought my Private Key is my WIF Key.. is that right? Assuming its right, because under Verify it says it has 2/3 signatures.

Hi Pb1x,
Really appreciate you helping with this..
I was able to decide the transaction on the blockchain site:
((i have changed the info/numbers below, as Im not entirely sure what is sensitive info aside from my btc address obviously)
   "lock_time":0,
   "size":337,
   "inputs":[
      {
         "prev_out":{
            "index":0,
            "hash":"hbhhjjasdk;hjksdbjdbjkdbkdbkbjkbjk;bjkdbjk;bjk;"
         },
         "script":"nkladsfnjkasdfknjdksnkjdsndkslndskldnsfklfdsnkdlfsnkfdslnkdsl'ndksl'ndfksl'nfdskl'ndsfko'[renjiionjk;njk;njdsabhjkabdsjkdbjk;bnjdks;bdjskdbsjdksabjasdk;badsjk;dasbjdska;bdjsak;bdsajkd;sabjdks;abdjsak;bdsajk;dbsajk;adbjkd;bjdak;bdjk;dbjk;adbjk;abjka;bajk;bajk;abjk;abjk;abjklabhjlavbhaljvahjlavhjlavhaljvahjlavhjalvhaljvahjlvahjalvhjlavahljvahjalvhaljvahjlavhaljvahljvahjlavhaljvahjlavhjlavahljvahjlavhjlavhjlavhjlav"
      }
   ],

      }
   ]
Went to the blockchain pushtx page, and got the following message:
Non-canonical signature: too long
I found this post on stackexchange, but its beyond my current understanding of this realm...
and this on github
any thoughts would be SO appreciated.. Thanks!
