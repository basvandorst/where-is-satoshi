It was a phenomenal 10 years.
I think the next 21 years is going to be *extra* ordinary.

Depends on how long you intend on holding it. If I was looking at not touching it for 10 - 20 years and it was a significant amount I'd punch my keys into a piece of copper plate and dig a proper hole for at least a 15 foot tree. The bigger the tree to plant the less likely anybody is going to find your stash.
Wrap the copper plate with something tough to protect it from the tree roots. Sandwiching it between a couple pieces of belt leather comes to mind. Wrap it tight.
Then it's off to the tree nursery to decide on the tree you want to bring home...or deep into a forest. Dig a hole in the bottom of the tree root ball and, surreptitiously, pack your retirement funds inside and plant the tree.
Hopefully it will be worthwhile cutting the tree down sometime in the not too distant future...no matter how tall it grows.

Many are already talking in 100k, 1million and 10 million sats. Hearing/seeing it more and more all the time.
Still, nobody calls 100 million sats anything but Bitcoin.

What do you mean you can't tell your bank to fuck off? What are they going to do, freeze your money?
There's plenty of other banks that will tell them to fuck off on your behalf, if you're willing to move those kind of funds over to them.
I'm so sick of bs banking.

They would be wise to accumulate for 20yrs and then begin distributing grants.

You're welcome, and I believe, if you invest in BTC at this time, it's safe to say you can expect a very decent profit by mid 2021. If not sooner.

Cats have 9Lives. How many times has BTC's death been announced?
@_date: 2019-10-13 09:08:17
First know that BTC has gained over 800 million percent in ten years. (just read that recently...math isn't my strong suit)
Secondly have a good look at this thread for ideas on investing strategies.  [ **A Sane and Simple bitcoin Savings plan**](
Thirdly, the ultimate decision on where and how much you should invest is always yours.
Finally, protect yourself at all times.

As the value of fiat goes down I would expect the price of BTC would go up in fiat. Isn't that why it's at a premium in South America and Africa?

Civil unrest is now the UN's construct. This is what they want.  This is the curtain they've fabricated as a cover while conspiring complete enslavement of the masses.

I think loaded ones are still available. One available right now is 25 BTC at bitcointalk  [ 
Still, I get your point...buyer beware.
@_date: 2019-09-30 05:14:25
I try not to give investment advice other than buy low, sell high with the standard caveat of not investing more than you can afford to lose.
There's just so much hand-wringing and mental gymnastics you can perform before you have to decide to do what you're going to do or stand down.
The "someone" you refer to has his vision. Allow him that, and those who support, or do not support him, their right to do so. No matter what forum he chooses to express his thoughts with.
@_date: 2019-09-30 02:30:56
I like the idea of group think (it can change the weather...so I'm told) but maybe there'd be less fiat hassle if everyone agreed to buy 0.001 btc every Satstxaday.
Or do you think it defeats the purpose of DCA?
@_date: 2019-09-25 18:17:37
These are all the emotions they have to sell you. Don't buy into them. Anticipate them.

@_date: 2019-09-22 11:17:33
I don't know how much skin you've got in the game, or if you've set your stop loss at a point  of profit. 
If you've adhered to the first rule (*don't invest more than you can afford to lose*) then why would you ***not want to*** HODL at a time like this?
Bitcoin requires nothing from you other than to secure your keys. 
Time requires nothing of you.
@_date: 2019-09-25 23:14:45
Try selling when the price goes up and buying when the price goes down.
Wait for the market to come to your trade. 
Put profits in cold storage.
@_date: 2019-09-29 17:58:01
That's a beautiful thing.
I wonder if they might be able to start making physical coins again.

Fractals are found easily enough on any timeline. The longer the better.
Something I've used in trading is the fact that a majority of wicks are realized on a shorter timeline.
The main point is to recognize when your trade is going south and act on it asap.

g'head...you can do this...you're ahead of the curve

Too intense?
btw I did take the time to read your article, with reflection it took just under an hour.
@_date: 2019-09-28 18:58:37
Hypothetically speaking, whose to say those keys are lost. I've always had a suspicion that there is an endgame involved with those "unmoved" coins.
Look toward mass adoption and the liquidity of that "stored" value as purchasing power. Subtract from the total supply the amount of BTC likely to be lost "forever" through inexperience or incompetence. Let's say roughly a 30% loss, which would leave 14 million. 1 million BTC will carry a lot of weight/power.
***Not to sell into the market, which I believe would be a transient disturbance, but rather to protect the market.*** 
Let's go full tin-hat hypothetical, just for the fun of it. Maybe BTC was created with the endgame of saving humanity from it'self.
Maybe BTC and many other cryptocurrency and their utilities will someday be enough to avoid, or even win, the first AI war. Some for and some against humanity.
That "Satoshi Million" may very well be our last hope against the technocracy that continues to entrench control over all things. Even to the point of penalizing my/your right to hypothesize on anything at all that they don't condone.
I for one hope that Satoshi's war chest is accessible for when (not if) the time comes.
@_date: 2019-09-29 02:25:54
Just curious as to what "underlying meaning" you reached. I've always been told I can be a bit too cryptic in my communication style.
@_date: 2019-09-10 03:45:57
much better ;)
@_date: 2019-09-23 08:25:32
smells like fud to me 
PJW and Mike are just a tad bit alarmist on this one.
The comments were well worth a read though.
Upshot is BTC's got it covered with a soft fork when necessary.
@_date: 2019-09-23 03:57:33
I think just a few of those will get you a good time in certain places around the world.
Then again, a stack like that could get you into a lot of trouble in those same places.
Buy btc now and hodl for a nice vacation sometime down the road.

C'mon, if I was in that scenario with halving coming up I would definitely buy 5 btc and create 5 1 btc cold wallets.
Sell 2 when it hits 50K to spend or buy any dips.
HODL 3  for retirement.
Moving SL to 20K after 50K...SL 40K after  100K...SL 200K after 500K
20yrs of this should have my mortgage payed off *and* early retirement.

Review what happened and know you had no business going long given all the indicators.
If you insist on margin trading again in the future learn to read the market better and get comfortable at trading with 2X leverage with only 20% of your collateral.
And there's absolutely nothing wrong with being a HODLer...what's the rush
@_date: 2019-09-26 08:01:07
Sorry I should have mentioned trend reversals. Corrections are expected but tops and bottoms on the double and triple taps are  good indicators of possible trend reversals. Sideways tracking is always a safe place to take profit.

Ever thought of waiting a week or two before you make your monthly purchase?
Change for the sake of change is sometimes good enough.

Who's been telling you lies? This ain't no get rich scheme.
Get yourself as much as you can stand as soon as you can. Own your keys and wait as long as you can stand it. Then spend/sell half when it feels good to you.
No guarantees but those who've waited at least 2-5 years in the past have been thrilled to have put up with all the fud 'n fomo.
@_date: 2019-09-28 20:49:22
I wonder what would happen if they created an app to alert traders of tops and bottoms.
Would HODLers still HODL?
