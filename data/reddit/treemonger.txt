Where are you from that is the glory of all existence?

As someone new to bitcoin, how do I accept bitcoin for my website? How do I know what is in my account?
@_date: 2014-04-06 20:41:50


As someone new to bitcoin, that's exactly why I come here. I want people to be innovators and thinkers and to see if things will work. I like this sub because of the collaborative effort to do good.
@_date: 2014-08-01 01:55:47
My question is why is Overstock enthralled with Bitcoin while the rest of their competitors arn't? Is Overstock trying to differentiate itself or is everyone else waiting to dip their feet into the pool?
@_date: 2014-04-06 23:57:53
Thank you for the updated response and that is exactly what I needed to hear. I appreciate your honesty.
@_date: 2014-06-29 20:52:01


The point is that it could be possible for CA to switch it's commercialized farming to accommodate its residents if they did succeed. I'm fairly sure Texas wouldn't fair well in that regard. 
@_date: 2014-08-02 02:38:07
Awesome. I'll have to start trying Overstock.com from now on. Are they as reliable as Amazon?
@_date: 2014-04-06 22:02:41


In that case, do you know of any safer alternatives to the status quo?
@_date: 2014-04-24 07:31:01
Is that an AT&amp;T logo?
@_date: 2014-09-12 16:31:04
Exactly. I'm sure he isn't trying to represent his company in the best way possible.
@_date: 2014-04-06 21:48:15
It looked like BitPay charges per month. Does Coinbase as well?
@_date: 2014-04-06 20:44:22
We'll see about that.
@_date: 2014-04-07 03:54:53
Clever girl.
@_date: 2014-09-19 02:42:35


Down by the river?
@_date: 2014-04-07 00:11:59


I will only convert it to fiat money in order to pay bills. Although, it would be very nice for my landlord and other bill collectors to collect bitcoin. As a complete outsider with 0 affiliations, I can predict that if not bitcoin, something like bitcoin will become mainstream as the dollar collapses. We are seeing those effects today as you probably already know. Businesses who don't accommodate their customers will generally lose unless they have corrupt laws put in place (see Comcast for more). 


I agree with you, however, I am an unemployed veteran who is starting a news program so my funds, needless to say, are extremely limited. More power to people who already have some dispensable income. I wish them well.
@_date: 2014-09-19 02:42:57
Yup. All of those words.
@_date: 2014-04-07 03:55:55


As a novice, what could happen that would make that a reality?
@_date: 2014-04-07 14:34:39
You made a great point. I hadn't considered how visa/mastercard/paypal operate. You sound like a smart person. :)
@_date: 2014-04-06 23:31:38
This is absolutely fantastic! I think I'm a believer :) Thank you so much for giving this information to me. It really helped me to understand something so complicated. 
Can I ask you one more question? I looked at the blockchain and found the 'Bitcoin Market Price (USD)' and it has had one minor bump and two huge bumps, although it looks like now it is on a downward path. Any idea why that might be? 
@_date: 2014-04-06 20:45:11


So how secure and stable would bitcoin be to someone with a new business venture?
@_date: 2014-06-29 16:30:34
But does Texas have the ability to grow produce anywhere near California? I don't think so. I'm still curious though.
@_date: 2014-04-07 00:46:03


That's one way of looking at it, but as another redditor pointed out, the market has been manipulated by people with vast sums of wealth in order to play the market. I'm convinced that is a true theory.
@_date: 2014-05-26 03:20:27
Sounds like the federal reserve.
@_date: 2014-04-06 20:42:30
Why shouldn't it be upvoted? Do you have a business next door?
@_date: 2014-04-06 20:31:12
As a new incomer to bitcoin, I am so confused. I want to use a crypto-currency to avoid the petrodollar, but whenever I try to do so, I hear about these crazy things occurring. Can someone please let me know if I am being ignorant?
@_date: 2014-05-27 18:09:49
Even though we don't need them to print money.
@_date: 2014-04-06 20:43:05
First they laugh at you, then they argue with you, then you win.
@_date: 2014-04-07 05:23:15
So you're optimistic? Honestly, I'm willing to try pretty much anything to avoid participating in this corrupt framework that is the status quo.
@_date: 2015-04-28 06:30:44
nonviolence works when violence is at hand.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:21:27
It's already money. If you believe in bitcoin, then it doesn't matter.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:25:47
Can you explain why the price of bitcoin dropped by like 50%?
@_date: 2013-09-20 20:48:29
This is great except for the part in the article where it talks about the United States stepping in to limit Bitcoins. Here is my take: **If our Gov't is willing to go to war over the PetroDollar, why on earth would everyone here think they'd allow Bitcoin or other currencies to form into a legitimate currrency?**
This is a serious question btw.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:22:58
As someone being honest to you, you'll probably need to figure that out on your own. There are a lot of scammers and people who will lead you astray. Look at the sidebar. There are some helpful links there!
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:49:02
No, just a coincidence.
@_date: 2013-09-20 21:14:07
I don't know. It seems to me that they squash anything they want to get rid of. Look at our privacy rights. I doubt they will ever relinquish the power they have.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:28:54
And the gov't intervenes again...
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:28:11
It started out that way :(
