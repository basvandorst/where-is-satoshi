Here in Australia he's facing criminal charges over tax fraud where he was given millions in r&amp;d funding and has nothing to show for it.
Many suspect that his legal defense relies on him claiming the expense was in developing Bitcoin.

ISO shits me so much, they are employed by government to create a standard, that the government makes law, then you still need to pay a few hundred dollars to even read it.
ISO is not the place to go to form an open discussion...

Being able to find an unauthorized and probably illegal copy is not the same as having an open standard.

It's worth noting that the CBA is being formally investigated in Australia and this might be seen as him jumping ship.
The investigation is finding a hell of a lot of dirt.

Bitcoin is still vulnerable to quantum computing breaking many forms of cryptography used by the protocol.
Just because the risks are small doesn't mean you can be like " there are no vulnerabilities"
Nothing is counterfeit proof. Just like nothing is hack proof.

Quantum computing breaking public key cryptography, or SHA is EXACTLY a case where you could counterfeit Bitcoin.
Quantum computing is only a few years away too.
It's better to know your flaws and risks than blindly swim in crocodile infested water claiming crocodiles don't exist.

This has been legal in Australia for years...

I wish everyone went back to having websites that are mobile friendly.
Everyone is removing mobile support from their websites and are all "just install the app"
I don't want to provide my location, contact list, and access to my sms messages just to do simple banking.

Can we stop even humoring this drama until evidence of any kind is available.
Everyone has said what they want to say, the story has run its course.

This guy is under investigation in Australia for tax fraud related to R&amp;D expenses.
The theory is that he's justifying getting millions in tax breaks because he invented bitcoin, as that would justify the R&amp;D costs.

I this raises a bunch of questions I feel don't have enough answers from op...
I'm hesitant to really believe OP's story now...
I'm going to skip this bandwagon and leave my Pitchforks where they are for now.
