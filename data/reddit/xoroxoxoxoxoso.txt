Now it’s a proper database. 
Before, every time a user went to the website I made a read request public spreadsheet. Then turn data into HTML using JS and insert it into the DOM

Good point, I will try to maybe somehow implement it
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:12:57
Thank you!

Thanks! It's a little bit better :)
Do you have any particular ideas? I want to add upvoting and commenting. People also seem to want more filter options like "stolen", "bad trade" or "wallet lost"

Thank you. 
Unfortunately it only got to rising and then fell off. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:26:29
Haha, thank you.

Thanks! I wanted to make it as simple as possible. So the login feature will probably come later. Also with other features like filtering by coin and upvoting.

Haha, unfortunately it really is. Glad you like it!

Thank you! I want to do that! Unfortunately my back is protesting today so I must visit the doctor and my finals are coming. 
I will implement it as soon as possible!

Thanks! Don’t let lost coins ruin your mood!

I just disabled submissions and deleted spam posts. Thanks.

It's done in a kinda hacky way.
Website is static. Vanilla JS, CSS (used bulma.io) and HTML.
It's hosted on AWS S3 bucket and I'm using Google Spreadsheet as a backend :D.
I just wanted to finish it during the weekend and didn't really want to spend time choosing proper backend etc.
I'll 100% rewrite it in some framework in future. Otherwise implementing more complex features would be hell. Maybe Angular.
