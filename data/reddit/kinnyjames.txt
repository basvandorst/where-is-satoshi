So where is the investigation on $27 million cash gone missing? Wouldn't gox's bank want to know?

For that you need to place $ into XRP Ripple Labs. Close your eyes and pray.

RT is for fools if you take that network seriously. I watch it sometimes only for entertainment purposes. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 18:38:16
I would assume since Bitcoin's story evolves every day that filming and editing is still ongoing?

Thank you! Someone gets it.

I'm not saying going str8 digital. Who was saying that? They still got their network, they still got their deals with the cable companies, they still got subscribers. 
As a way to get more money from everyone they can ALSO put out a product that everyone wants right away at once. Honestly they don't have to use XBT. But this is the subreddit for bitcoin so c'mon already.
Its already the most pirated show. Every episode available at once @ $3-$5 might put more money in their pocket.
I would pay with a credit card. But bitcoin is cheaper for them and us.

"A Prophet" is a 2009 French prison/crime film. 
Its my perfect analogy film for btc. 
Main character (bitcoin) is a half French half Arab street punk who goes to prison and learns the ins and outs of all the gangster sub-groups (finance systems) to eventually become the top Player because he outsmarts them all.
@_date: 2014-05-26 12:25:08
So true. Everyone go watch "Pirates Of Silicone Valley"

Tibanne The Cat,
Are you.... Satoshi Nakamoto author of the bitcoin white paper? If so, did you write it alone or did other cats (felines and/or cool people) contribute to its authorship?

To quote Albert Einstein's wife: 'I understood the words but not the sentences.'
I do see his point at the conclusion - bitcoin super scaling up will end up turning bitcoin into a banking system, and I am ok with that. 
Banks don't kill people. Some people who work for banks and lose their soul kill people.

I'm just curious about the (de)evolution of a person who goes from 'hero to zero'.
If somehow we'll ever get the truth about gox's story, it could make for Bitcoin's own 'Wolf Of Wall Street' meets 'The Social Network'.

I'll upvote for visibility. But this commercial is neither fun nor funny.

Bitcoin is a protocol. It does for finance what Yahoo! did for the Waterton research department from the Herman's Head TV show. I hope that clears things up.
@_date: 2014-12-27 12:32:22
Thanks. Much obliged.

This was.. so hilarious! Like a town hall episode of 'Parks &amp; Recreation'.

Oh Erik I thought it was you placed the bet. Now I believe it's a crazy idiot. Or maybe this is the new dice.

Hey Jason,
Unrelated Q: How are preparations going for the Beltway conference? And why is Butterfly Labs Zerlin scheduled to speak? What could he possibly have to say that informed attendees would listen to?
@_date: 2014-03-31 20:01:22
He doesn't seem to have any avenues of contact to be found online. 
@_date: 2014-05-09 16:14:42
No no no ..... sigh..... face palm. No offense. I want to avoid this type of rhetoric. Sorry if I sound evil but it would be nice if a lobbyist or two came forward and said they were attending because they smell money in the air. Again not meant to be evil. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:41:30
It's not our Gavin. The goatee is the giveaway! Its Evil Gavin like Spock from that one episode of Star Trek. Who here can youtube link that? 
Funny humorous nerd Mr. Andresen is.

They are not smart. They may be educated and studious, but not smart. I've seen them speak and listened to them broadcast on SiriusXM - they have no wits about them. But I am glad they are on the bitcoin bandwagon if for nothing else they have old school financial connections.

Nothing will change until an exchange based in USA is up and running.

Whoa whoa whoa stop the clock! I never said a word about death dealing. I don't support that. "Obtain" is a synonym for capture or kidnap. I want him to confess to everything he knows and did. Death is easy. Life is hard.

The bitcoin is a commodity
@_date: 2014-12-29 05:49:49
I was always under the impression that some type of exchange will debut on nasdaq by spring/summer 2015. Now that the regulations are almost here they gotta develop, secure, and roll out the product.

I've seen both Gavin and Todd speak in public and interact with other devs. Todd is a child. Gavin is an adult. I'll stick with Mr. Andresen's decision making each and every time.

Hey guys and gal. I know I am doing a douche move here but I basically said something similar a while ago here myself:
True story about me: I got a job in the mortgage broker business back in 2003 as a telemarketing manager. I started seeing who was being sent through all the way to the approval process  (everyone). I said to myself, "Man, compared to what my parents had to go through and what money they had to put down vs. now? Wow. And majority of these folks don't make what my folks make. And I don't see minimum wage going up anytime soon to keep up with these home prices. Hmm do these people truly understand what % their payments are going to go up to if they can't re-fi in 3 yrs? Wow. I know people on Wall Street have a phrase called Bet Against The Market (?). Well, now should be one of those times."
I say that to say this - I wish I was that guy in the video.
@_date: 2015-04-07 23:55:37
Gavin is the best. If it wasn't for his levelheadedness I'm not sure if I would have bought bitcoins in the first place all those years ago.

The U.S. Navy and the petrodollar. Once you realize how entrenched those two forces are.... you'll understand that the U.S. could be 50 trillion in debt and still nothing would change.

Barry, you got nothing better to do with your time?  You're telling me you don't have your own car service? Why aren't you checking on the progress of your exchange? 
@_date: 2015-10-10 03:27:47
This is very disappointing. 
@_date: 2013-06-25 00:20:24
Everyone should take news coming from that part of the world with not just a grain of salt, but two five pound bags worth.
@_date: 2013-08-11 00:53:35
The host mispronounces Gavin's name. Gotta get Mr. Andresen on Geek Time on Howard 101 on SiriusXM satellite radio. 
@_date: 2013-08-15 22:49:06
Wow. Bypasses the need for an android wallet completely. Can we send to non Coinbase addresses?

I think you are high now. 1k into $6 per coin is about 166 coins = $167,000 thereabouts. Not millions but a nice stash for grass. You Burnout.

Once it gets to 1000 whats to stop it from going to 5000? Once it gets to 5000 whats to stop it from going to 10000? Once it.... oh Gods listen to me! I gotta get off this crazy train. But I don't wanna miss out!

So glad I never went through the whole process of signing up with them. Coinbase must be creaming themselves right now.

Not me. But I know two people who signed up early and once the press release came out they each plan to pay right away.
