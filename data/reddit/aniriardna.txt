Was just wondering the same thing. Seems unlikely.

A bit of both, but this too shall pass.

Let me see if I can help with the whole shutdown situation. Does your government accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:24:04
Sorry, I've invested all my grudging forbearance in my own government. Can I interest you in some TrumpCoin?
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:52:53
Of course it wasn't. Not to mention that people have been hiding money or assets from the state since forever. The principles haven't changed, the mechanisms have. Perhaps this report isn't relevant at all - I'm not arguing that, but I'm really tired of reading about countries pushing strict regulations and blaming everything on bitcoin being used for money laundering. Such utter bullshit. Money laundering will always be an issue, with or without bitcoin.

I dare you to find a single article on this 11-day-old website that hasn't been stolen letter for letter from other sources.

I wouldn't have either if she hadn't seen my mining rig. I used to have a Dota team. Pulled the plug on it in 2014. To this day my mom still calls me every time Dota is on the news.

hard fork incoming
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:05:15
The ones from CME will go live on Dec. 18. CBOE wanted to beat CME to the punch and are launching theirs on Dec. 10. So, it's fair to assume that bitcoin will continue its rally throughout December. And if it doesn't, oh well, who cares, it's been a helluva year.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:31:36
I probably shouldn't even dignify this with an answer. My mother was born two years after WW2 ended. She was three days old when our king was forced to abdicate by the communists and Soviet forces occupied my country. She was 42 when my country came out of the communist dictatorship. She lived a hard life in troubled times. Half of the world's population still does, living in poverty with basically no access to proper food or safe drinking water, let alone technology and information. If you're not aware of that, you're the dissociated one. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:42:10
I really hope Newsweek doesn't call her.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:04:34
Who calls the dragon knight?
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:45:59
Well, that's close enough.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:57:45
I actually don't remember telling her I bought bitcoin. She would have told me not to waste my money. She was visiting, she saw my mining rig, I told her the rig creates a coin called ether and then tried to explain btc, eth and other coins to her. She probably thought I created bitcoin on my rig when she saw it on the news.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:41:13
If that was the case, I'd be a hundred-millionaire. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:11:08
Rise due to CBOE and CME upcoming bitcoin futures launches, more likely.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:21:18
Bună! :-) Small world.

My mom and his mom should get together and make some sweet 'n crunchy bitcorn bitcones.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:29:39
No son of mine is gonna buy any bitcone and watch any fools' balls games!
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:52:12
Probably the upcoming onset of regulated futures trading from CBOE and CME. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:18:22
She actually calls it "bitcone" or something along those lines.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:32:33
Probably not, but she's still gonna call me every time bitcoin is on the news.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:38:05
He's been trying to seem humble ever since that time he defended those huge staff bonuses given out right in the middle of the financial crisis by saying bankers were "doing God's work".

You're a very lucky guy!

She's just a sweet 70-year-old who isn't familiar with the new technological world. But clearly compared to you everyone is a dingbat.

She created Newsweek. And, as Leah McSmth Goodman would put it, not even her family knew.

"I don’t like it. I’m not comfortable with it. I'm kind of an old dog to be absorbing that kind of a new trick." Actual quote from the Goldman Sachs CEO, who later went on to admit he hasn't warmed up to mobile phones yet. [source](

Roughly one million in the addresses that we know of. Who's to say he doesn't have some more?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:51:04
No idea, I've been asking myself the same thing. I've read some opinion pieces from analysts linking the bull run to a sky-high demand fueled by CME's upcoming bitcoin futures launch. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 09:02:44
Read it as 'ABBA CEO' and now I have Mamma Mia stuck in my head. Thanks.

Didn't want to suffer alone, that's why I commented in the first place. You're welcome.

This is like comparing apples to oysters. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 09:39:50
Your website is down.
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:07:07
They don't. 'Apples and oranges' just didn't convey the dissimilarity well enough.
@_date: 2018-02-16 05:25:45
Yeah, quite possibly. But the "exchanging hands" bit might still prove to be interesting. MGT were claiming to be the largest bitcoin miner in the U.S., with a total hashing power of 60 PH/s. And now Riot's eyeing the 60 PH hurdle.
@_date: 2018-03-07 09:19:54
I can't bring myself to cheer for anything that Putin says or does. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:34:50
Yeah, sure. The aggregate value of all cryptocurrencies was around $18 billion on January 1, 2017. Get some perspective before crying wolf. If you can't handle a bearish phase and truly believe that "the bubble has popped", do everyone a favor and just sell. Come back in a couple of years, maybe less, and buy at an ATH.

So, I'm guessing your bus is not a BMW, am I right?! Thanks for telling people what bitcoin is all about. I'll pay with bitcoin if I ever get on your bus.

A unisex size S is generally equivalent to a women's size M, that's why I asked. I'll keep an eye on your website. Good luck!
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:59:18
Seems like it. Also, Riot's CEO [has sued]( McAfee and MGT for some sort of breach of contract. So there's definitely something there.
@_date: 2018-02-21 07:54:22
It was long overdue. Now do something about your customer support. It's shameful. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 08:02:51
I thought it looked familiar. I browsed this website last week. You've got some pretty nice artwork over there!

Central banks and cryptocurrencies are philosophically opposed.

I'm not familiar with how things are in the US, but according to this 2017 [report]( just over half (54%) of Americans have money invested in the stock market. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:02:54
Whenever stocks get refilled, they get sold out in a matter of minutes. And the prices went up by at least 60% in the last couple of months. So, I'd call it a shortage, yeah. Although I think they're producing the same amount they always have, but the demand went up drastically. At least that's the situation where I'm at.
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:16:05
I don't think it's an advertorial. Sponsored content is clearly labelled on Bloomberg. Advertorials look like [this](

If you're wondering why you're getting downvoted, it's probably because we've been seeing a gazillion variations of this story over the past couple of days.

They only banned payments using crypto, for now. Buying, selling, holding of crypto are still permitted. Things can change, though.

That's right, the antivirus guy. MGT announced they were "committed to exceed 60 PH/s in first quarter of 2018", claiming to be "the largest Bitcoin miner in the US". Riot seems to be challenging that position.
