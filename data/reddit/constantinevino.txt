Interesting question. 
My random thoughts on this:
\- Maybe no paper money needs to be printed  
\- Central bank will not be needed as much  
\- Services of Country and local Banks will not be in demand and they may shrink their operations since we can trade and lend and borrow direct from eachother online within seconds.  
\- Interest rates may be determined by the market and not by a group of individuals like they are now.  
\- the Banks will have less grip on the monetary system and therefore less power  
\- Taxes, all kind of financial services may be automated, governing our countries and their finances (government) will gost less.   
\- The global loopholes to hide wealth may be less attractive because it will be safe with bitcoin since your wealth, described by certain number in certain currency in some country  in some bank cannot superinflate. Bitcoin is stable. It's value can only change by demand not by supply. Hiding your wealth may not be so efficient anymore.  
\- maybe, just maybe our world may become a little bit better place by giving all members of our planet one currency. Simple rules to earn and trade in digital currency may simplify trade, trieties, eliminate political pressure on economy.
The result of all this may be that:  
\- Economiuc crises wouold occur less  
\- Certain processes in banking, politics will change / be less pushy / give more freedom to people, which may result in rise of prosperity for average earth inhabitant for the next millenia to come.  
\- It would be perfect if we al would only have to work e.g. 4 hours a day instead of 8 (talking about basic labour, the one you need to do in order to feed yourself) because less money is needed for the banking system and the political system and the bureaucratic system of our economical and political model we make use of today.
I wonder.
