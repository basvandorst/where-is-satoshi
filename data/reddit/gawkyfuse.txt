So, I might not completely understand this, by my understanding of "taint" refers to how correlated bitcoin addresses are to each other, which has implications on the pseudonymity of the ultimate owner of those addresses (or, as a somewhat related point, if any bitcoins are associated with an address involved in theft). I think that this is more around making sure bitcoins are properly mixed to reduce this taint, which would be a separate issue from how the mining process works.

Based on some research that I have done, my sense is that Bitcoin address generation with Excel will be extremely challenging. I think that sha256 and ripemd160 are fairly easy, though the elliptic curve cryptography would be very challenging given the size of numbers that Bitcoin uses for this. I have been putting some thought into a toy system that uses much smaller numbers as a starting point. If I am successful in figuring this out, I will be sure to post!

There were two of us who put this together - one focused on the video and one focused on the spreadsheet.  From start to finish, I would say it probably took about 20 hours in cumulative work, maybe half spent on the spreadsheet and the other half spent on the video.

Clearly, Excel (or really any software-based approach) is far too slow to effectively mine Bitcoins, though hopefully this will be a useful tool for understanding at a very granular level how the algorithm behind the mining process works.  We hope that you enjoy this!

Thanks so much! This is a very good question. Basically, you would transmit the information to the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network using TCP, (which is a core protocol for how information is transmitted over the Internet). To do this, you would first need to establish a connection with a known peer (generally on port 8333), and then transmit the block information using the Bitcoin mining protocol, which is fairly well documented here: 
Mining software does this automatically, but for this spreadsheet, one would need to build a script that sends this information to the network after connecting to the peer. Given that it is highly likely that any block mined using this spreadsheet would be orphaned by the time it is found, we have not tried to incorporate this next level of functionality into this spreadsheet.﻿

Thanks so much!  I very much appreciate your kind generosity!!!

Thanks a lot!  With respect to speed, using the Excel spreadsheet is waaaayyy too slow compared to other mining processes.  When I ran a macro to see, the spreadsheet was doing about 10 hashes per second compared to millions or billions of hashes per second for real mining solutions.

Thanks so much! You might also find the spreadsheet that can be downloaded in the video description to be helpful. That contains all of the calculations used to mine the block, so will hopefully be pretty instructive alongside the video.
edit: added second and third sentences.

You're welcome!  I am happy that you enjoyed  the video!

We are currently working on an RSA video that will hopefully be interesting, as well as something on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (if I am able to finally wrap my head around it). As of now, we don't have plans to do anything on Script and X11, though will certainly consider it for future work.
To answer your question on orphaned blocks, my understanding is that these occur when two blocks are mined at nearly the same point in time (within a few seconds or so). Once that happens, new blocks are mined from each of these, with the next mined block determining which of those two blocks will remain in the main chain and which will be the orphaned block (the main chain being determined by whichever chain is longer). Once a block is determined to be orphaned, the transactions in that orphaned block are submitted back to the pool to be mined in a future block.
The reason that the Excel spreadsheet would result in an orphaned block is that it would probably take several thousand years for it to actually mine a block, at which point in time it is highly likely that the transactions that it was attempting to verify would have already been included in the main block chain.
