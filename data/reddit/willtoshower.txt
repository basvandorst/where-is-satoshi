“you borrow someone else's Bitcoin and you sell it on the market for 11K. Then you wait and when the price goes down you buy new Bitcoin at 8K, which you then give back to the original owner. “
Wait. If I borrow 11k to sell it at 11k, and then buy back at 8, how did I just make 3k? Seems based on my understanding of your explanation, you’d have simply bought btc at 8k and did some fancy raz mataz loan.
I’m missing something.

Ah. Now I get it. You’re not returning the dollar amount of the btc at the time of purchase, just the crypto amount. 
What I don’t get is why would anyone loan you btc to do this. What do they get out of it?
Thank you!

Damn. Grandmas got 0.00 fucks.

Ideally yes. 
However, as someone new to crypto and who loves the idea of decentralization, I’ve spent weeks trying to figure out which bitcoin is “real” BTC or the BCH fork. 
That’s not as easy as it sounds.

Is your grandma the exception or rule? 
And does she like oatmeal yes or no?

A shell game, of course.

Agree that’s its come far but it has an image problem. The problem, as a new person, is propaganda. 
I agree that people will carry on with bitcoin. But which bitcoin? 
When they forked BTC, it’s almost impossible to tell which direction is staying true to a philosophy of decentralization. 
I’ve heard a lot of rhetoric on each side and have boiled it down to the following (tell me if I’m wrong).
Keep the block-size: run the risk of Bitcoin  turning into a settlement mechanism that pushes transactions off to a few centralized institutions  that process those off-chain transactions.
Increase the block-size: potentially only big mining pools will be able to compete and then we’ll have a different kind of centralization.
This took me weeks to figure out and I don’t even know if that’s an accurate assessment. 
I guess you’re right, it might always only be a subset of people due to this complexity.

Dude. Well thought out insight. Have any further reading you recommend?

Hope you’re right!

“It’s up to us (people in general) what we want to do with this option.”
Good point. We’ll be back to paper fiat in no time. ;)

Noob here. How did you figure this out? Genuinely curious.

Great write up!

Disagree. The dollar is backed by “The full faith and credit” of the U.S government. Aka the economy of the U.S aka TRUST.

"TL;DR (from twitter)  The May 15 BCH hard fork made unspendable coins spendable again, allowing miners to claim them. -When an unknown miner claimed these coins, the [ ]( &amp; [ ]( pools coordinated 51%-attack, to return coins to original owners."
"Original owners".... right. ;)

Go to Coinbase.com or a decentralized exchange and buy in directly. Skip fidelity!

Pretty good sound bite. That said, there's already a separation of money and state. It's really a separation of money and banks.
