Wouldn't expect that from Amazon, though. They did begin as a Startup and Bezos doesn't seem like and idiot incapable of understanding the potential of Bitcoins for his own business. Perhaps a jerk, but not an idiot.

So you want bitcoin to succeed but you're not willing to do anything about it.. besides redditing, of course. Shame on you!!

I would only add that considering the "cans and can'ts", spending more than 1 billion dollars on this computer power, it wouldn't make sence. Not for attacking purposes at least. Yes for mining

In my opinion, more than just the couch failed.. few people as audience, couple of speakers didnt make it, and for some reason I've found the topics really basic and lacking content

The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in "Metcalfe's law"–which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants–becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's.

Wasnt impressed by the audience nor their contributions though

As an entrepreneur in this incipient industry, I've come to enjoy this first sentence:
Bitcoin is the first fully digital, global and decentralised currency, which by its architecture lets you have your money as save as in a bank, without the need of a bank. With it you can pay to and from anywhere in the world, because it's global, and you can transfer any amount of money to whomever you want, for free, without the need of any company in the middle, and, of course, without any arbitrary time/amount restriction.
It has worked for me perfectly for the -very important-: "Cool! how does it work"

It took spain one of its worst economic contractions to understand the importance of this matter. Guess it'll take the same for the US or an Aaron-kind of organized revolution.

Saw the article and besides feeling a strong repulsion towards the lack of objectivity/research/work behind the story, I think no reasonable person would change its opinion towards your brother in law's bike shop service. 
First of all the reasons your brother in law gives for using bitcoin are incredibly valid, and don't support in anyway their thesis of Bitcoin as an instrument for illicit use. 
And for someone who wants to fix a bicycle it is 100 times more important the excellent review he's got on yelp than his -false- will to contribute with a subversive movement towards anarchism/government destruction/typical-reporting-bullshit.
You did absolutely right recommending him to accept Bitcoin and it was impossible to guess and idiot was going to use his case for a stupid article. 
Hope everything ends well.. cheers!

First of all.. I'm extremely sorry for not answering before. I don't usually use this Reddit account, and had no idea that this post had been don on this one.
We do have users from Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, Brasil, etc.
I do believe Chile/Bitcoin is a great scape for people suffering from extreme inflation rates, though for them it's still very hard to leave their local currencies. That's where the problem begins. 
Please don't hesitate in contacting me in case you need something, o you have an idea. guillermo

Hi guys, 
I'm Guillermo, cofounder an CEO of SurBTC.com. 
Just to clarify, we raised government seed funding, which in this case is equity-free but very auditing-intensive. 
We're also under Chile's FinCen supervision (the UAF), which makes our exchange as compliant as it can be, considering that Bitcoin isn't anywhere close to being regulated. Which is good in most cases, but bad in those where your business gets to guard people's money (in CLP or BTC), and lack of regulatory structure opens up the doors for unscrupulous "businessmen". 
I'd like to invite you all to check us out, comment and please feel free to give us feedback! We aren't here for the short run, but for helping Bitcoin grow healthy in South America, where is most needed.

Thanks a lot! it doesn't only matter the amount :) awesome gesture. 
@_date: 2015-09-18 12:30:29
That's super true. We'll improve the system next Monday, as Chileans have immersed themselves in holidays/helping labours. Including the SurBTC team (very well deserved :)
@_date: 2015-09-18 12:28:45
It's legit. Sorry for not building something easier to recognise as legit.. but time is against us. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 14:59:41
Thanks for that! is there any way to prove that number? I mean, what are the chances of getting the double spent BTCs on 0 confirmations?
Maybe I'm asking the wrong question:
Whats the lowest amount of BTCs a hacker is economically-interested on double spending considering the time/electricity/success-probability involved in the act of doing so? 
@_date: 2015-02-23 15:01:48
Thanks a lot!! very useful.
