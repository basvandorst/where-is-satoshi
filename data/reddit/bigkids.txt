Look into or for help regarding that.
Needless to say, do not sign any contracts that oblige you to only write articles for them and also, you need to keep ownership of your work, meaning, keep the rights to your masters.
Side note: I am not a freelance writer and speak to a lawyer before signing anything.

Right and what is the $10 BTC for?
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:05:03
Well, maybe you should at least cash out an emergency fund. Something that can keepmyou going for 6 months to a year. Maybe take out a bit more and invest in stocks, bonds, something for the long run.

You've been reading too much about Enron, take a break.
You can always buy locally from your local coin groups and meetups.

Bitcoin is at $6000, kinda expensive to jump on the train now. invest in Berkshire Hathaway Inc. or something.
Bitcoin can be so volatile, just this week-end it dipped 25%, let's just say it's not for the weak of hearts.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:18:55
Right, at least.

When will the mining of bitcoin end? Block rewards, when will we reach the end?

The real question is: "What time is it? What time is it?"


in every glass and soft laughter falls upon the summer air. We
know, by the rules, that at some moment the Black Horsemen
will come shattering through the great terrace doors, wreaking
vengeance and scattering the survivors. Those who leave early
are saved, but the ball is so splendid no one wants to leave while
there is still time, so that everyone keeps asking “What time is
it? What time is it?” but none of the clocks have any hands.
