Until lightning network comes. Internet was basic at the beginning as well, now it has 7 layers. Humans are smart, we will find a solution to the scaling problem. For now, we can take comfort from the security Bitcoin offers in storing wealth. Thats just how i see it. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:51:35
Like Andreas said, Bitcoin is experiencing scaling problems because it has scale. It survived various attacks over the years and its been tested like no other coin.  Sure, they are other coins that have significantly higher tx per second and are cheaper but they havent been tested like Bitcoin has and make other sacrifices to achieve higher throughput .

Please see my answer below or above.  Thanks!
@_date: 2018-09-09 13:17:21
Awesome.  Thanks for this! Very helpful.

If I'm keeping the latest, validated copy of the Blockchain, aren't i making a contribution?
@_date: 2018-09-09 11:39:05
Can you please explain why not?
@_date: 2018-09-09 18:45:24
Around $120
@_date: 2018-09-09 06:31:28
I have 2 channels opened thus far, and i have funded them.  Is there a way to confirm if they are funded in both directions? 
@_date: 2018-09-09 11:50:43
Sent it to you in a message.  Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2018-09-09 12:36:25
Great! I'm just a regular person, not highly technical. It's fun to learn and very exciting.  
@_date: 2018-09-09 11:26:00
@_date: 2018-09-09 09:59:18
It validates the Bitcoin Blockchain and it is also a node in a Lightning Network that hopefully contributes to routing payments. 
Keep in mind, it is only software that's running on $50 raspberry pi computer connected to external hard disk (pointed by green arrows). 
The rest are just modem and router that were always part of my home network.  
@_date: 2018-09-22 11:55:52
You are just guessing.  Those graphs side by side mean absolutely nothing. Believe me, i wish it was that easy. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 11:47:12
Cool, thanks for the comprehensive answer. I will definitely look into it further.  It's really exciting to discover new things about this technology. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:22:56
Go for it! Feels good to contribute to the cause. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 11:00:42
Satisfaction that I'm contributing to the bitcoin network.  
Also, if you route payments through your lightning network node you collect fees, although insignificant now they might increase in the future. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 07:41:04
It took me around 5 days using the raspberry.  
@_date: 2018-09-03 05:27:23
why do we have to have capitulation. Isn't it possible for a series of good news to start a new bull run without capitulation?  
@_date: 2018-09-09 13:19:52
Thanks.  Still working on it. ��
@_date: 2018-09-09 18:37:37
Are you downloading it through torrent or ftp? I had issues with ftp. Torrent worked perfectly.  Hope that helps. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 03:27:22
Here is the link to the tutorial 
@_date: 2018-09-09 18:31:01
It's just my network storage drive.  Haven't connected it yet. Nothing to do with the Blockchain.  
@_date: 2018-09-30 10:20:54
How much fiat do you have in your bank account? 
@_date: 2018-09-09 09:49:26
No I'm not. Unfortunately it is not profitable in Australia. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 05:08:21
I'm not quite sure. Lol. I think it validates the bitcoin Blockchain and helps routing payments on the Lightning Network.  
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:01:36
If Bitcoin hits ATH before October i will be there ��. Cheers mate!
@_date: 2018-09-09 06:38:30
Thanks for the information.  I will investigate further and hopefully learn more. Cheers!
@_date: 2018-09-09 18:56:46
You don't need to understand how a every device works on the most basic level to set it up, use it. You just follow the instructions provided. 
The tutorial i linked above is very comprehensive and plenty of good people willing to help. Cheers ��
Btw my comment before meant to be light hearted. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 11:17:05
I'd love to help you but I'm really just a beginner myself.  I'm sure there are people here with the right expertise who can help you out. Sorry.
@_date: 2018-09-09 12:20:24
Sorry i don't know. But if 230GB is 9 years worth of data then i would assume around 25GB per year. I could be wrong though.

It will reboot and i need to enter a password to unlock the LN wallet 
@_date: 2018-09-09 11:48:38
To learn.  To be part of the network. Fun project.

Awesome! I'm in the process of setting up my raspibolt as well.

Microsoft Office licenses.  Got 20% discount for paying with BTC
@_date: 2018-05-09 21:15:51
Title of article says get your 0.002btc before masses do but in the conclusion it is recommending to get 0.02btc before masses do. Hmm.

What a great summation.... not

The point she was making is that we just keep putting savings into bitcoin, not using bitcoin for anything and we also failed to take profits when we could have.

Not only that. Gold can also be made in the lab artificially. Although the process is currently too costly and challenging, in the future that might change.
@_date: 2019-10-27 19:39:43

U don't need a screen.  Just login remotely from another computer.  
The 2.5" screen i have is purely to display the status. Whole setup was done remotely. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 10:57:58
It was such a different time. Everyone around the office was excited and only talking crypto, hardly any actual work was done. 
This year, people licking their wounds quietly, no one dares to mention crypto. I'm even scared to bring it up because I will get dirty looks from people. 
Please don't compare 2018 to last year. Nothing will happen.  Hope we finish this year above 5k.

I'm not saying price of bitcoin can be predicted.  I'm just disagreeing with your point that nothing  can be predicted.  Scientific method let's us predict things with high degree of accuracy. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 20:50:18
We predict weather, celestial events, etc all the time. So in a sense you can predict some things in the future.

Or if you look at it from another angle 1% of global electricity production to secure a global financial system that serves everyone. Also, there's no problem how much electricity we use but where it comes from.
