I want to know if it would be a good idea to create an account per year and have all salary bitcoin deposits go to this account and archive at the end of the year and create a new one for the next year?  The idea behind HD that will create a receiving address for every deposit throughout the year for every month.

Q: if this side-chain idea, two-way-peg, and merge-mining gets rolling...
Would it be possible for "metacoins" like: Mastercoin and Counterparty, which currently run on Bitcoin Blockchain be able to migrate and become a side-chain as depicted?  Thus continue to provide their utility as before?

Basically in your Ripple account you add a ripple gateway that Coinbase could become and "link it" to your Ripple account so you can start exchanging and say pay in USDs to say another person in Euro.
"A powerful “side-effect” of Ripple’s distributed exchange is that it allows for automated cross-currency payments at the best available price on a global currency market. "

Agree 100% it would be great for Coinbase too.
