Agreed it barely moved. I wanted it higher... btc seems broken.

Hes no longer the CEO. How old is this?
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:30:08
Actually no, Kids dont use FB anymore. Its for their parents. FB is really dead from a young persons point of view.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:47:02
Its still dropping
@_date: 2018-01-02 11:49:39
Agree. Someone pointed out there needs to be a delivery date in the first response there on twitter, and all the fanboys shot down this fair question. It does look worrying, its almost as though they want btc and LN to fail, time is key here. There needs to be some timelines communicated and attempted to be met.

Hahaha nice

Not only that, the guys who he stole the FB idea from and settled out of court, are highly invested in this. Zuckerburg will not put his money there.

Another thing is do smaller transfers. Did you try to move all of it in one go?
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:35:02
Yea South Koreans are awesome. Dont let your government try and control you.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:47:04
Still waiting. Its been stuck at this price for ages. Its freaking me out.
@_date: 2018-01-31 10:03:29
Why is there a barbell in the pic. Did the guy drop a weight on himself due to the price being displayed in the gym? :)

It wasnt about being illegal it was to prevent 100k being frozen. If you send first 10k and its frozen you can atleast still do something with the 90k left. Such as convert to btc etc and move to a wallet in the meantime.

Hes just annoyed that Ripple has taken over :D Its hilarious really.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:04:13
I never used it in the beginning. So Im with you :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:04:44
Litcoin is dead now, the creator dumped all his coins and cashed out...
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:55:12
Feel sorry for you dude. But mistakes can and do happen. The main thing is get back into the  game, and hold on for dear life. We still have lots of events happening soon that will make Bitcoins price continue to goto the moon. 
One thing I have learnt is whilst there are alt coins, they mirror the dips of bitcoin but not the peaks. Im not going to move from Bitcoin to something else. Im going to HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:09:44
Its a toxic place for sure. Full of negativity and just bitcoin slating. It would be nice if they used all that energy to promote their altcoin instead of acting jealous etc. They are not fooling anyone with that behaviour. We know it hurts that their coin is not increasing in value at all.

Praise be to Allah, let the $$$ rain down like a monsoon :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:57:08
Yes everything Roger Ver isnt.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:54:44
he also took all their money :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:10:29
Jealousy also
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:49:58
Hey dont worry about it, his impact was as per usual 0. The price has changed nothing on both Bitcoin and bcash since that interview. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:08:57
Wow you are indeed a great person. Fantastic work.
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:46:22
Yes they could, a lawyer would eat this up. The use of the name and logo, its clear confusion. There would definately be a case to sue his ass.
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:39:56
I totally get you, so essentially youre saying... BUY BUY BUY
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:16:23
Wow do you think they did their own stunts. I wonder how many Indians it took to make that scene?
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:38:55
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:10:05
Exactly. Total BS no-one knows anything for sure. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:18:57
Hi, anyone here used Coinbase in Europe to make deposit bank funds of any significant amount. I see the bank account is in Estonia? :)
