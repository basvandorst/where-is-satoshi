It took a half an hour of phone calls and thumb twirling before Wells Fargo gave me the $12,000 from the available balance of my checking account that I needed to buy a car from a private party recently. 
Part of the money was from a Wells Fargo loan that a family member had transferred from their account to mine. The manager felt it was necessary to verify with the other branch that they knew who the other person was. Do they think I am some super hacker that penetrated the banks internal systems?
This is after I had called them that morning to verify they had the cash on hand and driven an hour and a half to get the money because I moved to an area without a branch. I had enquired at another local bank about opening an account and transferring the money but they said there would be a 5-7 day hold on the money for new account holders.
The traditional banking system needs to die. 
The best time to buy Bitcoin was five years ago, the second best time to buy Bitcoin is today.

Should have bought McDonalds anniversary coins. They are going for $12.50 on eBay. I got mine doing $1 BigMac purchases with coupons. They have real value, 1=BigMac, which is better than the US dollar. Might sell and invest in Bitcoin, haven’t decided yet. Also I am sick of eating Big Macs.

Agreed. When it comes to Bitcoins and Africa, Nigeria is the biggest market for remittances:

When dollars are sent to Nigeria, US currency is picked up at the local bank. The receiver then goes across the street and exchanges it into Naira at higher "black market" rates from their friendly local currency trader. 
These currency traders operate openly and would be the natural agents to exchange bitcoins for local currency. The human infrastructure is already in place. We don't need cooperation from the banks for this to work.
Edit: It looks like this changed in 2013, after I last left the country. [prazant is right!](

3G internet has become popular and is offered by all the major carriers in Nigeria. In any case an internet cafe is only a short walk away in any decently sized city.
