Lol, degenerate embryo

Yes, saying cunt is fine. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:31:41
"The less use bitcoin has, the less value it has?" wow, really. Great work with that... The fact you use "retarded" just shows how an absolute cunt you are, people can't help being born "retarded". What an offensive slur.
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:10:41
Right and you have a homophobic name, and i'm the worst lol
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:26:28
I am really sorry you you feel so deeply about this. I just hope you question your place in all this before other people hurt your feelings. Sending all my love, hope you find a replacement payment processor soon sweet cheeks. xxx

This is a sub reddit for bitcoin, and your saying i'm pathetic , over a 3rd party payment processor bitcoin never needed? 
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:17:16
And I guess you're a grown man, with grey hairs on their balls. Brieming with life as you get to chuckle at calling someone a "child", you tool.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:12:34
How is it bad news? Stripe never done anything for me so why should I be sad about some 3rd party bs that will never affect my bitcoin outgoings? sheesh
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:00:54
You think I ever had one? . I read this and had to make an account. And I see what you done there, you funny fuck.
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:18:18
You really are not!
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:31:02
Explain how? considering bitcoin was created to get rid of shit like them. Don't tell me it's bad, that's the stupidest thing I've read all day, jesus fuck.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:55:14
Wow, what a dull-witted sentence. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:11:27
ooo a twist! lol
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:01:50
Can we get someone to say they will eat their left nut if the price drops to $5k and under? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:18:20
jesus fuck lol
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:14:27
What a stupid question...
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:45:34
Go back to wow.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:50:43
This has nothing to do with anyone banning bitcoin et al. This is price manipulation at it's finest, disguised as the 'bubble popping', 'end of all crypto currency' ....'save the children from the crypto criminals'..lol
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:14:08
We haven't even got to version 1 of Bitcoin. Everything is pure speculation, you can't just just assume that now proves that it has failed when the system is decades away from being complete. No one knows. How can there be a Bitcoin 2.0 when 1.0 uncompleted, how can you tell if it's one or the other? You don't know, no one knows. If you watch the news or read reddit and people say it's a great store of value you have unfortunately fallen for the hype. Sorry.

Fine tell him then :P
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:07:37
Sorry stable currencies? point me to one!

Don't use Rick &amp; Morty out of context. That makes no sense to this lol
