"bit bucks"
Would that be $10 in BTC, or 10 BTC?

New to this subreddit... What percentage of people here do you think are into the Liberty movement? Or at least, what percentage WAS it, before the recent surge?

Would be interested, but what I wanted to buy was $10 more expensive than MSRP at Best Buy, and I only expect BTC to gain value, so little incentive there... Good luck though

I thought FinCen just said they're treating it as foreign currency? Or is that just for U.S. citizens?

I love how BTC was first gotten by regular people. Who regularly gets the "real" money first? People connected to the governments that create it, probably the most likely section of people to be corrupt, considering the whole monopolization of force thing.

I suggest BitFloor instead of BitInstant. I sent $50 to BitInstant over two transactions, and I got screwed both times just from the site being broken in some way (not working well with Dwolla, etc). The first time, I contacted support and they sent me the BTC. However, this took two days (pretty big days, ordered March 28, didn't get it until March 30th) and they only gave me the BTC based on the latter day's price. The second time, I ordered March 31st at just under $100, and I STILL haven't gotten ANY BTC at all from that. No response on either of the two support tickets I've opened for it since then either.

I did the same at $45, and then took until $90 figuring out how to buy some

I've heard that sentiment before, but don't understand the meaning. Care to share?
