Let's say I have bitcoins and travel to Japan. 
How might I retrieve money from them? 
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:29:56
Ethereum is better. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:51:52
Ethereum classic is a joke. 
Ethereum is Facebook, bitcoin is MySpace. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:49:10
New influx of buyers, also bitcoiners realizing ethereum is a safe bet for income 
@_date: 2017-05-22 13:43:05
I agree. Yet still it was stolen, not just simply lost. 
I don't see the usefulness of a technology that cannot improve its self. I mean the creator is young, though I believe he is a genius. 
Bitcoin will always have its place. Hell, Tom from MySpace still has lots of friends.

They're foolish imo. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:29:35
Lol. He is a good president.

Seth Rich leaked the dnc emails to Wikileaks 
@_date: 2017-05-15 09:48:06
Facts. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 13:15:39
They hard forked to get back a fuckton of money that was stolen in a hack. 
I don't really care what you think, it's obvious your bias is for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:39:01
I think ethereum is coming for the top spot. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:16:50
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:11:48
What's the difference? 
This just in, no one cares 
@_date: 2017-05-18 02:39:39
No it's not. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 13:59:59
Tell that to Microsoft and the list of other companies partnering up with ethereum. 
Really we'll do fine without you :) 
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:28:51
Ethereum would like to have a word with you 
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:42:57
The founder didn't own the stolen coins he helped retrieve. 
You're sour you didn't invest in ETH. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:16:57
I think it will level out around 3000. 
You heard it here first. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:17:11
Still driving the price up
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:27:57
Hahahaha factoid 
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:07:39
Too bad they wouldn't make you as much money. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:44:51
Isn't bitcoin going to split into 2 or possibly 3 coins On august 1st?
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:22:09
Nope. It's not. 
Let's hear your serious reply?
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:58:53
Bitcoin is going to split into 2 possibly 3 coins on august 1st
Let's see where this goes. 
That guy has little to no credibility. Many speculators are saying the opposite. 
Ethereum will overtake bitcoins market cap very soon. Already about 80%
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:34:03
Prove it 
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:41:36
UASF is an altcoin as it does not follow the rules outlined in Bitcoin white paper (PoW).
I suggested to the UASF folks to write their own white paper that reflects their consensus mechanism: the number of non-mining nodes.
I can understand they want to freeride on the Bitcoin name or use it as leverage against non-Segwit miners (who are the majority btw). But again, UASF is not bitcoin, it can branded as "bitcoin inspired" altcoin like the other hundreds of altcoins.
True story!

Russia wants to build its own crypto currency based on the eth block chain. Bitcoin definitely has inflation also. 
It's up like 60% in a month. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:28:30
What's wrong with putin?
Your bank would do the same for you using fdic insurance 
Less than 1% a year, won't go much higher than 100mil , also eth is being mined at 14x the rate of bitcoin
