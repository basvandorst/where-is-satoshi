btw I’m not a hater, been through a few crashes and it’s just what happens. It starts going sideways, then creeping down, people lose money, panic sell, turn against it, start calling it a scam, a bubble, tulip mania etc... even if they were “experts” and all in just a few months before. $900 would be a dream, $1500 would still be ok. It might not happen this year, but if there is no significant recovery then next year could be a great time to load up. Buying on the way down averages your risk but also takes up a lot of time obsessing over price. Set your alarms for what you think is a reasonable price. Personally I’m accumulating RVN and leaving everything else I have alone. It gets way too complicated at tax time.

Wait until it’s $900

A few hours outside of Havana, I would have to check a map. It was next to a beach.

The Hôpital Albert Schweitzer Haiti is a fantastic cause. 
Can't we just help them put a QR code on their website?

I too am up a little late... I will contact you all tomorrow. I see three of you have registered already. Don't forget to include your handle so I know you came from r/bitcoin

Even if they convert them back to USD that's fine, they still get the money they need and it will make it easier for people to donate. If someone can help set it up I will donate to  and have their contact info if needed.
