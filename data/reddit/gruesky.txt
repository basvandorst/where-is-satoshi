I saw a post of someone with one in Toronto, but I can’t recall any other details. If you do find one, I’d love to get one too so let me know. Quadriga doesn’t offer that service ... maybe ask them to start? I’ll do the same. :)

make sure to pay capital gains when you do - worth calling an accountant about how to strategize your withdrawal.

I haven’t seen this question asked... it’s worth discussing.

when you turn BTC into cash that is a “gain”. If you put $1000 in and took $2000 out, that is a $1000 gain. which is taxable. However how it gets taxed is very different in each country. If it’s a lot more than this, speak to an accountant. there are strategies to withdraw that will be smarter than all at once.

This is inaccurate as they are still working with Vault of Satoshi, one of their banking providers.

I disagree, but it's entirely philosophical and not really relevant.

Can confirm this too - deposited three times with them. Pretty quick,

It still has the most important quality of a fiat currency, as it is "money without intrinsic value".

Is this a vulnerability that the scrypt or other altcoins also face?

Ability to separate the coin-coin transaction history and fiat-coin history ledgers would be a nice feature.
btc will obviously be the main coin/coin transaction system (btc/doge, btc/vtc, btc/ltc, etc) but will ltc fill this role as well? (ltc/doge, ltc/vtc, etc)?

They dont' yet, but it's a planned feature - although they haven't released when just - soon.

It is probably the case that the early adopter has large sums of coins with all the major exchanges, in addition to their own paper wallets. This doesn't mean it's not worth their time to try and send someone to retrieve that lump.
At least, were I an early adopter, that's what I would do.

What do you mean by ETF status? Exchange traded funds changing somehow?

Can we stop shittalking the other crypto here? We should praise diversity not degrade it.
