Andreas' talk is fantastic.  It starts at the 33 minute mark.  If i could upvote this thread twice, i would.  What he says in this talk is SO important!!!

Absolutely, i try to ask every business that i do business with if they'd accept bitcoin as a form of payment (since i have almost no fiat anyways).  We all should.  There is no shame in promoting bitcoin, it has enormous power to change the world for the better.

The reason porn.com, naughty america, tiger direct, and overstock.com are having great success with bitcoin, and ultimately the reason your employer will have great success with bitcoin, is that there's a large community of people, myself included, trying to abandon fiat and use bitcoin as their main currency.  
The more companies come on board with bitcoin acceptance, the larger % of my wealth i can keep in bitcoin rather than fiat.  People like me, and there must be quite of few people like me considering the boost in sales for these companies, are happy to spend our bitcoins at merchants we normally might not, just because of the sheer fact that they accept it.
If your employer accepts bitcoin now, they'll see a huge boost in sales just like the aforementioned companies did.  If your employer delays or procrastinates about it and is late to the party, they won't.
Or to put it all very simply, my new favourite restaurant is Smokey Burbon BBQ because they accept bitcoin (even though i'm a flippin vegetarian and there's only 1 thing on the menu for me!).  Right now, Bitcoin acceptance = new customers = new profits.

Wonderful!!! I will be signing up immediately.

I like this idea a lot, so long as we are willing to follow through and actually purchase things from these companies in bitcoin once they accept it.

here's the link if you don't have it.  the gentlemen from coinbase, overstock, and circle are doing a good job representing the community imho.

I have been wondering about this too.  Booting into a fresh install of Ubuntu with an offline copy of bitaddress is extremely daunting for non-techies.  I think we need a more user-friendly solution for this.

I love this kind of FUD from people who have absolutely no clue about libertarian concepts.  If a libertarian is in trouble, they'll run to the cops, right?  OF COURSE!  The police have a legal monopoly on law enforcement.  There is no competing agency to run to, because the operations of the police are enshrined in a government created legal monopoly.  Furthermore, in this non-competitive environment of law enforcement, we have NO LEGAL RECOURSE when the police fail to protect us from criminals.  Recourse is the most basic offering any service provider can make.  My hosting company provides recourse if they cannot provide 99% uptime on my webserver, my ISP provides recourse if they cannot provide 98% uptime on my internet connection, and so on.  In fact, every non-governmental service that I pay for, has some kind of recourse or performance guarantee, and they either refund me, or credit me, if they fail to live up to their promises.
Can you imagine how the police would stack up in a competitive environment?
"We can patrol your streets and protect you from crime!"
"Great, how much does it cost?"
"10% of your salary."
"Wow, that's a lot!  What kind of service can you offer?  Do you have any kind of guarantee?"
"No, we have no guarantee whatsoever."
"So, if you fail to protect me from crime, you don't owe me any money or compensation of any kind?"
"Nope.  Oh, and you should know, statistically you're more likely to be assaulted by one of our employees, than any criminal"
"Oh, wow.  And if I am assaulted by one of your employees, what recourse do I have at that point?"
"Well, you can take us to court."
"Will it be a fair trial?"
"Totally, we have other employees called Judges, that wear these big black robes, and make sure the trials are fair."
"Wait, if you mistreat me, and i take you to court, YOU pick the judge?"
"Yup, and we set the rules of the court too."
Does that sound like a deal anyone would sign up for?!
Tulip, YOU are the whiny bitch who doesn't understand what the free market is.

This is my approach.
1.) I explain that it's a revolutionary technology, created through solving a long-known about but previously unsolved problem in computer science, simply "how to get a network of computers without a central authority to reach a consensus"
2.) I explain that this technological innovation specifically allowed the creation of a public "accounting" ledger without a central authority, which in turn has allowed us to create a much more perfect form of money.  I explain about this "accounting ledger" having tens of thousands of independently operated computers all over the world acting as "robot accountants" verifying the legitimacy of every transaction on the ledger, and coming to a full consensus every 10 minutes on every single transaction that's ever taken place on this ledger.
3.) I explain what the most desirable qualities of money are:  good store of value (must have scarcity), cheap to store and transfer, trustworthy (no counterfeiting, no central point of failure, no risk from human fallibility), neutral (no discrimination based on political beliefs), divisible and portable.  And that traditional forms of money have fallen way short of the mark in regards to many of these qualities.  I explain that bitcoin is so exciting to me because it's nature and structure makes for an absolute grand-slam home run in each of these qualities.
4.) Finally, I explain the practical benefits to merchants, the benefits of deflationary currency for holders and savers, the benefits to the 3.5 billion unbanked, etc.
I take this approach because i think it's important for people to:
1.) understand that this is a technological innovation, not a fad
2.) understand the structure thoroughly, because that allows people to picture it in their minds (makes it seem 'real' to those stuck on the fact that it's digital).
3.) understand why the currency money system sucks
4.) talk about the practical benefits of bitcoin for everyone
I don't know how much people really understand after one conversation, because it's a lot to digest, but I have had only positive reactions so far.  I do add a lot of enthusiasm and elaborate quite a bit on each point :)

If you do a bitcoin kickstarter, i'd be happy to donate.
If i were doing a class on bitcoin, i'd incorporate some of James D'Angelo's stuff, especially from his bitcoin vs. gold lecture (though ALL his videos are fantastic).

it took me a couple of minutes to think about this, but it is a fantastic solution!

This would be an extremely helpful service. I would imagine many people would be able and willing to pay some small fee for insurance against hacking. It would be very cost effective for you to implement redundant cold storage, so that both your business and it's customers could sleep peacefully at night. Allow bitcoins to be withdrawn after 24 hours notice, charge a small insurance fee, and people will think of it like a fully insured savings account.

It's much easier, and arguably much safer, to open an online wallet on a reputable wallet site such as blockchain.info as compared to running a wallet on your own computer.  Just make sure you use a good, secure password, a real email address, and enable two-factor authentication. Once you get bitcoins from either Coinbase or localbitcoins.com, transfer them into that wallet on blockchain.info.

great work.

quickbt.com and localbitcoins.com are your best options, i think.

Absolutely correct.  I'm a localbitcoins dealer in canada, and when the chinese started getting onboard with BTC and pumping the price up, demand here in canada went through the roof.  I could no longer keep up with client demands (couldn't fund my exchange account fast enough) and the main Canadian exchange, cavirtex, could not keep up with sign-ups for new clients (and are still working through a two-week backlog apparently).  Though the run-up in price was perhaps a result of the chinese getting on board, it created a huge media storm all over the world, and increased interest and demand, globally.

You've been duped my friend, this: "allow those with resources to forever limit those without at will" is exactly what government does.  When you have a system of centralized control, you have a system where the financial incentive is to control that power structure... And unfortunately, humans being fallible and all, it's not too difficult if you have the means and the money.  I think one of the advantages we all recognize about bitcoin is that it doesn't have a central point of control.  It's infallible.  It's neutral.  It cannot be corrupted.  It IS the anarchy you despise, and it's pretty effin wonderful.

Do you think that's okay or completely effing evil?  I just have to ask since you seem to be advocating or at least defending the use of violence to control peaceful people.
