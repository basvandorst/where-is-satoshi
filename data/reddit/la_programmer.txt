People dont post on reddit for the gold, but they are always thankful when somebody sends them some. I am not a big contributor to content myself, but sometimes an answer there saves you a lot of work

Ohhh, the days :)
@_date: 2015-03-21 03:07:35
That they offer it?

I had a problem with them once. They solved it through zendesk, but it took months. It was 1 btc (different problem though)
