The $16T number took some slack because it was the total volume of loans given over a period of time during a couple years of the "financial crisis", not the total amount of outstanding loans at a given time. We do know that the [Fed bankrolled foreign banks with upwards of $1T dollars in 0% interest loans]( at the time, though. But just think, the Fed is printing $80B per month. That means they are taking 800 of those $100M pennies in value from the US taxpayers every month and appropriating it to their own control. This is how mass slavery and hedgemonic global power is maintained.

Good luck collecting taxes on the bitcoin economy, which will grow as the fiat economy shrinks. Everything that governments around the world do to weaken their own currencies will only strengthen bitcoin. When a currency "revaluation" occurs, the default standard against which the newly valued bills are measured against will be the bitcoin, because it doesn't float on any mining collaboratives, international trade associations, or the whim of any central banker.

You have a very funny perspective on why the US left the gold standard, and then the Bretton Woods system. The reason they left those systems was because it prevented them from performing deficit spending without spiking their bond and T-Bill rates, so they could finance the Vietnam war on the backs of an unwilling population. A floating fiat currency is nothing but a form of slavery. That's why they hate bitcoin so much, because it threatens their ability to do "quantitative easing" and "deficit spending" ad infinitum. It means they would actually have to find financiers to fund wars, instead of just printing and devaluing their currency. The USD only has a few more years of being the de facto world currency, and once that ends, massive inflation begins. Bitcoin is becoming the world standard currency because none of the governments trust the others to have their currency become the standard.

"Never have a computer log-in system where a person has to use their SSN "
"California enacted legislation in 2001 that generally prohibited businesses from engaging in certain activities with SSNs, such as posting or publicly displaying SSNs, mailing documents that display SSNs before the document is opened, printing SSNs on cards necessary for accessing products or services, or requiring people to transmit an SSN over the Internet unless the connection is secure or the number is encrypted.(6) Over twenty states have passed laws similar to California’s—Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, and Virginia.(7)  Five states have placed significant restrictions on the private solicitation of or insistence on collecting SSNs – Alaska, Kansas, Rhode Island, Maine and New Mexico.(8)"
“It shall be unlawful for any Federal, State or local government agency to deny to any individual any right, benefit, or privilege provided by law because of such individual’s refusal to disclose his social security account number.”  Sec. 7(a)(1).
So if there is any law which requires businesses to get your SSN for any priviledge, it is illegal.

I think bitcoin will replace all fiat currencies, but it will take like 50 years or more to happen. It will be a slow winnowing of value away from fiat and into bitcoin over a long period of time. Governments will fight bitcoin and slow the adoption rate once it becomes an existential threat to their fiat currency scam operation. I honestly don't think public acceptance matters very much at this point in time and we shouldn't be so fanatical about trying to convert everyone. To fight it is like try to fight the rising tide, we don't need to tell everyone to come into shore, they'll do it naturally.

The general population never supports war, and they would never voluntarily finance it. The revolutionary war had less than 35% popular support. The only way that modern warfare is financed is by deficit spending, and the era of deficit spending is coming to an end. The new war is economic. Billions of people to feed and too many lights to keep on, someone is going to starve to death in the dark.

True enough. The miners are limited to a 10 light-minute radius. You would need a different blockchain for a different location further out, unless you wanted to wait a long time for confirmations.

Wells Fargo lost a class-action lawsuit for $200,000,000 for robbing their own customers. Why would anyone want to do business with those scumbags?

Big players hoarding would cause the supply to be thin, and the price to go up. Tell me the name of this bitcoin options market where they all have a ton of short calls.

Is USD a real currency? I'd argue that if it can be printed by a central counter-party or "bank", it's not currency.

Maybe not *legally* possible, but very very possible, nonetheless. Oops, hacker attack, all my bitcoins went to black addresses and are now worth more.

They are a self-funded startup working on bitcoin 2.0. They need capital to continue development. Any organization goes throw a confusing growth process at the beginning, and not all the employees have to be coders. Would it be better if it were just Vitalik and Amir by themselves?


Illegal in one state, in a country they don't live in. Those guys have home addresses in Switzerland, they are a lot less afraid of the NY state government than you may imagine. The Europeans don't make all their decisions in reaction to or even in cosideration of the latest American government edicts, as many Americans might presume.

Fiat currency systems are [the biggest scam in the history of mankind](
Today's banks do not operate on fractional reserve lending, at all.

Maybe in the USA this is normal. Remember when Angela Merkel called Obama a Stazi? The world economy is a much bigger place, and the USA's slice of the pie is getting smaller every day. This will only drive business *and smart people* out of the USA.

That would be a long wire. Maybe we should just use, like radio-transmissions instead, for astronomical distances.

Hate to break this to you, but bankers like Switzerland better than NY. Switzerland has access to way more funds than Wall Street. Any exchange that has to follow these rules will never be able to compete with one that doesn't. Maybe some slimey suit will try to run an exchange from NY, but it won't last long.

There are over 20,000 vendors all over the world that accept bitcoin, and more every week. I'm not sure how you defend the idea that bitcoin is a "traders goodie". Maybe that was true 2 years ago, but it's certainly not true anymore. Almost everyone I've asked about bitcoin has heard of it.

The only reason I can see for using such an ETF would be to make leveraged trades. I wouldn't be willing to put up with supporting the new NY regulations to do it, though.

They handcuffed Charlie Shrem. They handcuffed Ross Ulbricht. They'll handcuff a lot of people before this is over, mark my words. I won't be one of them.

Hopefully Trezor will have an independent security review by then. Or there will be another competitor with no links back to BFL.

Think about what a $1T loan at 0% interest means. It means the American taxpayers are paying the interest (of inflation) against that $1T until is paid off. The banks take these loans because the overnight interbank lending rate is more like 1.5~2% API, and they make billions of dollars by re-lending the money to other banks at this rate. Why would they ever pay off a loan for $1T to Uncle Sam's bank, the Fed, when it's at 0%? It's like free money forever, paid for by the good ole' citizens of the USA.

Actually, they are not. The rules in Europe are significantly more relaxed. Most European countries have formally established that bitcoin is a currency and that no VAT taxes are required when transferring from fiat to bitcoin. It won't matter soon though anyhow, I don't know if you noticed but the entire global fiat currency system is a house of cards. Every single fiat currency in history has died in an inflationary spiral, and the US Government is printing over a billion dollars *per day*. Their days are numbered, so to speak.
