It’s worthless

Doge is down 30% currently valued at .005 USD a coin. Lol. Sure. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:12:49
This is the dumbest advice. Don’t don’t this.

Not an expert but I believe any bitcoin owned for more than a year and sold is taxed as a long term gain , which varies between 0-20% depending on income.  Anything sold prior to a year held is taxed at the income.  
If the IRS can get Capone, I would be on the side of caution.  
Couldn’t they retire, then sell a bitcoin here and there ?  They’re income would be low so the tax rate  on BTC lower. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:53:05
Except major currencies are backed by military, laws,  a taxable population base, while bitcoin seems to be powered by memes.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:35:35
No one is exchanging bitcoin for goods or services.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:43:40
Lololol! Can’t handle any criticism! You guys are a f’n cult!

You're grouping in too much here. 
The USD has value, because people exchange it.  Why do they exchange it? Because it's relatively stable, universally recognizable, and is backed by the faith and credit of the United States Government.
Why do people put faith in the U.S. government?  Because we protect the majority of the shipping lanes. 
Bitcoin and Visa is not an equivalent.  Visa can process and verify 60 million transactions a second.  Bitcoin can process 6.  Visa is universally recognized and accepted. 
Bitcoin may very well be priced at $1,000,000 USD some day, if there are 21 million people willing to pay 1 million each, or 210 million people willing to pay 100,000 each, etc. 
Crypto currencies possess no ability to tax, regulate or protect the ecosystem they operate in.  The only value they have is what people are willing to pay for them.

Sell bro. It’s going to 5k in 2 weeks
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:31:18
There's value in the blockchain. There is no value in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:18:17
Correct - but don't conflate value with price.
Price = what people are willing to pay.  
Value = what it is actually worth.   
Both change over time, but some things have intrinsic value, i.e. value from the properties itself, at the simplest form.  Gold, at the most basic level has value because you melt it down and make tools.  
What is bitcoin's value at it's most basic form?  0s and 1s?

Don’t hold your breath for Blockchain [10 years later, no use for the blockchain. ]( 
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:25:44
If we can monitor millions of phone conversations, text messages and emails, I’m sure they can track the 6 or so bitcoin transactions a second.

Shut down silkroad, shut down terrorism propaganda websites, I think the could flip this switch off overnight if they wanted to.
Anti terrorism Money-Laundering Act of 2018 : any US citizen who purchases, sells, or transmits any crypto currency in excess of $1,000 and does not report the seller, buyer, and transition within 10 Days faces a minimum 10k fine and 2 years in jail..
You think the tech bros at coinbase won’t oblige ?  
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:13:13
I read something that only 500 or so coinbase users have reported sales to the IRS so far. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:13:13
Actually it doesn't.  Scarcity?  Bitcoin cash? Litecoin, ripple, eth, dodgecoin, etc?  
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:09:32
Gold has value because of its properties, it has medical uses, electronics uses, etc.  It's also scarce and rare, cannot be created out of thin air (alchemy) 
The dollar was one backed by gold.  It was an easier means of exchange and safer.  
Faith in the dollar, or euro, or yen, comes from the government behind it.  The military protects you, shipping lanes, etc. Government's have the power to tax, to regulate, to enforce contracts.
Bitcoin has none of these. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:51:14
Collectible value, like beanie babies or pet rocks. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:51:58
It goes to zero.  If the IRS can pinch Al Capone they’ll be able to take on bitcoin.  It’s still transmitted over government regulated telecommunication lines. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:14:31
No one would accept that piece of "currency."
If you have a contract with Joe Smith to mow his lawn for 10$ and he doesn't pay, you can use the courts to extract compensation.  That's why the USD has value.

Hello darkness my new friend. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:14:26
Read this and then see how you feel. [why the block chain and bitcoin are worthless. ]( 
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:19:35
Military, laws, the courts, a taxable base of 330 million people. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:47:38
The federal reserve and the US dollar is backed by the ability to tax, defend shipping lanes, etc.  bitcoin has none of this. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:28:28
You're going to get wiped out. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:10:40
Scarcity, value to the beholder, enough where they are willing to trade goods or services to be its sole possessor. 
 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:40:15
It’s going to zero. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:47:45
You can’t afford a miner either. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:57:26
Go after the exchanges.  Go after the telecommunication companies that own and operate fiber optic lines. 
Shutdown completely, probably not, but start taxing transactions, and the lure is gone. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:46:56
The answers to this should be telling.  Bitcoin was touted as the currency of the future, but no one can use it as such.  It’s at best a speculative “asset”, except it pays no dividend, carries no intrinsic value.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:25:40
Would you enter a contract to be paid in BTC with the fluctuations now?  
What if you were to sell your car to me for 1 BTC.  You and I shake hands, and the price of bitcoin plummets from 15,000 to 10,000 in USD.
Do I still owe you $5000 USD?  Currency has value from relative stability.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:59:36
You forget the USD is backed by the ability to tax 330m Americans plus businesses, the worlds most powerful navy which protects shipping lanes, and a regulated legal system.  Bitcoin right now is backed by what? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:01:49
What are you talking about lol
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:45:41
It's going to 2200$
