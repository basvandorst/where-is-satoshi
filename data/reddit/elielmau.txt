I do want to get more people into the technology. Heck! I think is great I can send some money to my family in Venezuela so easily.

This really made me laugh.

It must be very relaxing to know that, even more if you have others depending on you.
Thanks for sharing!

What did change? Do you buy pretty stuff now? Do you light your cigars with $100 bills? Do you give your family and friends a lot of gifts? Do you add guacamole to your burritos now?

I agree, is not cheating. I was trying to say that the goal becomes irrelevant when there was no path walked.

If this is true, it's exactly the same I have figured. 
The best example I can give is cheating on The Sims, when you work everyday and get promotions, know new people, buy new stuff; the game is fun. When you cheat to get a lot of money; the game is fun only for a while, then you get bored and never play again.

I told your story about the Corvette to a friend and he was fascinated. He has always wanted that car. Do you happen to have an anonymous photo of your (now sold) car?

That's in part why I find this so fascinating, you're technically wealthier but not practically until you sell your coins. It's like a Schrodinger's coin, its worth much and none at the same time and you don't know the real price until you sell.

Did you get any serious offer?

House = Safety
Things, including a car = Comfort 
Safety &gt; Comfort

Amazing! What will you tell your grandchildren when crypto currency becomes the only currency?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:30:11
I really find this whole situation very interesting: So many millionaires in so little time. I'd love to interview some of you folks and know your story but I know this is a very sentitive subject because of safety reasons. Thanks again for sharing, I appreciate it.

I’d buy a house and a car for me and my family, and probably travel all I could. I think experiences are way more valuable than stuff. 
Edit: And that car would be a minivan, can’t fit 5 in a sport car.

That's amazing!
Would you say that it woudn't matter to you if your cryptocoins get back to the price you bought them? (Honest question)
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:32:12
So, you didn't buy any of these things?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:22:07


That's awesome and sounds very reasonable. I'd say that's $500,000 for the house and about $3,000,000 for another 50 years. Good luck with that and thanks for sharing!
