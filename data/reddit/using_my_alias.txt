Yes, it's open source. A really nice programable piece of software. It could be set up to send automated sms messages/calls, powers IP PBX systems, VoIP gateways, conference servers and other custom solutions. It is used by small businesses, large businesses, call centers, etc.. (That last sentence I grabbed from their site).  I was thinking some one could write something to allow someone to send some btc for a reminder text, or a wake up call. Or like you stated in your post, a message to a politician or celeb.. That's what actually prompted my response..

kinoshitajona is right on with the wallets. Although, I thought I'd mention  is a separate wallet. You fund this one from your device/computer wallet. From the site you can tip people on facebook, Github, Google+, Reddit, StockTwits, Tumblr, Twitter and Youtube. You'll need to connect to those in the Changetip site settings.

Are you asking how to run a miner and have it pay to a coinbase address?  If so, you want a p2p pool.
E.G:   sgminer  -o  some_p2p_pool:port  -u coinbase_bitcoin_deposit_address  -p x
Warning: It is highly discouraged to mine directly to a deposit address of an exchange. There have been many problems when people do this. You should mine to only your own wallet. I only told you how to for educational purposes.

I see a lot of people buying GPUs for scrypt mining, then they mine the altcoins to trade for btc.. They also have Middlecoin, Hashcows, etc. that will take your scrypt hashing power and mine for the most profitable altcoins, then trade those and pay you in btc..

I answered this a little while back in another thread.   for the lazy: "Because most miners think that the people doing a pre-mine are trying to get rich and don't have any intentions of keeping the coin going for the long run (e.g. Pump and Dumps).. I am not saying all miners believe this, but this is the perspective of most.. As for the people that do it, they say it is for bounties, future development, giveaways, faucets, etc. All of this is suppose to be kept on a public ledger to keep track of it.. These guidelines are not generally followed, so the whole pre-mine thing has been stigmatized.."

It was mentioned that he had a stroke. "Satoshi Nakamoto's three-year silence also dovetails with health issues suffered by Dorian S. Nakamoto in the past few years, his family says. "It has been hard, because *he suffered a stroke* several months ago and before that he was dealing with prostate cancer," says his wife, who works as a critical-care nurse in New Jersey."

The bitcoin-qt client for your PC requires the full blockchain to be local on the machine, it's the way it was designed. The Android wallets use a centralized server, not requiring the blockchain to be local on the device. Although, if you use Electrum on your PC it does not require you to d/l the blockchain either.

Yes, I had seen that, too. Although, it is saying you need to sign up with a CC before you can spend any Bitcoin with them..
@_date: 2015-02-22 00:11:31
This is pretty slick, but the fact that it requires a credit card is a big hassle, and kind of defying the purpose.. Some folks simple do not have one, and the ones that do have one could simply just use them.. At least have an option to create a profile without the need for one.. I totally dig the concept, but requiring a CC is the only big deterrent for me. Also, this comment is meant to be constructive, so I hope it comes across that way..
