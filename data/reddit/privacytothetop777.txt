Not me.  Like with kids, you have to pick your battles carefully, and this isn't one of them.

This.  I wouldnt trade my Tesla P3D for any lambo (or any other car) if I wasnt allowed to sell.  It's a daily driver supercar!

I don't think you want to split your seed that way.  I think what you really want is to use is Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme (ssss).  Split your private key (or any data) into n parts and require k parts to unlock.  This means you need k/n parts to recover the data.

I believe you can calculate the total number of possibilities solutions by taking the number of words in the word list to the power of the number of missing words. For instance, if you were missing the first 8 words, it would be 2048^8 which is a big number.

You go ahead and high margin long EOS as it is 7x undervalued according to that site.  Alternatively you can short Monero as it is 6x overvalued according to that site.  However, I doubt you will do either as the site is purely for price confirmation bias.

Keywords in the above paragraphs are, "failed to report income", "did not report their transactions properly", and "addressing non-compliance".  
Your title is literally "if you filed crypto gains they are going to look into you first" which is wild speculation and most likely false.  
Why would the IRS waste time and resources on people who  report crypto currency related gains properly?
The people who are being targeted are likely those who were reported to the IRS as having significant $ amounts fiat withdrawals related to crypto currencies and who didnt report any gains or where the withdrawals wildly vary from reported income.

Title seems misleading.  If you filed your crypto gains on your taxes, most likely the IRS will not waste time trying to audit the accuracy because it's an honest attempt to report and probably correct.
What appears to be the case is if you disclosed (via some public method) that you had crypto currency transactions, or some entity reported your transactions, they will be looking to see if you have any reported transactions on your taxes.  If not, they may reach out to see why not.

You are looking for a privacy focused coin.  Bitcoin may implement some privacy enhancing features, but most likely cannot implement what is required to be fully private.

Blockchains may be public, but a public blockchain does not necessarily have to be transparent.  Opaque blockchain do exist.

The end of this article sums up what defines Bitcoin nicely...it's the users.

My thoughts didn't end up in words clearly.  Bitcoin now has the ability to have side chains via lightning network.  A scalable privacy coin as a side chain would address most privacy concerns for the user.  If the question is about on chain privacy, then its not likely much will be implemented, but possible.

Sounds like you need a tax attorney (not me).  Here are some questions to get you started though.  Did you file the appropriate gift tax return each year?  Can you show transaction history (with wallets you control being the best) to support the transfers? If not, you may not have a strong case.
