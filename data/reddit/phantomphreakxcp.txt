A blockchain is a global, trustless, distributed ledger. Where Bitcoin uses a blockchain for recording ownership of a digital currency, Chronicled uses one for recording ownership of a cryptographic tag linked to a physical good.
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:10:48
Yep. :)
@_date: 2014-11-17 16:08:57
Thanks! Not many people catch that...
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:42:19
Absolutely! We'll be porting all of the relevant toolkits to Counterparty, and Ethereum contract code works on Counteparty pretty much out of the box.
@_date: 2014-10-21 19:55:14
Counterparty handles unconfirmed transactions the same way that Colored Coins does (whatever the implementation). And this has nothing to do with mobile support.
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:48:15
Definitely! We'll start by using this code: 
@_date: 2014-10-06 22:38:34
I do. ;) Send me a DM.
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:12:19
XCP is used to provide functionality where it isn't technically possible to use BTC, for instance in paying for the execution of all smart contract code (as Ether is used in Ethereum). Beyond that, it is use for the binary options functionality and when reserving some asset names. More generally, it represents stake in the protocol, and will be used for voting on protocol changes and judging community sentiment.
@_date: 2014-11-17 20:55:10
It's not really our place to do that.
@_date: 2014-11-17 16:27:44
Within a month.
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:43:34
We're really focused on building the best, most secure smart contracts platform out there, and on making it available as soon as possible. Part of that is definitely developing a complete ecosystem for browsing and executing smart contracts. Swarm and Whisper are totally independent systems, but ones that we're certainly excited to see released!
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:26:54
The virtual machine is designed very carefully to avoid this problem, but even if it fails, there are a number of redundant failsafes in place to catch just such an error.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:09:41
We try to avoid public speculation on the value of currencies. XCP is necessary for all of Counterparty's advanced features (including the smart contracts system).
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:29:25
I for one am very excited!
I don't exactly know what application of blockchain technology will be the first to cross that barrier, but the important thing is that a lot of people are trying to build it.
@_date: 2014-11-17 15:53:00
Yes, it's definitely possible. With a Turing Complete smart contracts system, we can do anything that any cryptocurrency can!
@_date: 2014-11-12 19:24:09
Will do!
@_date: 2014-10-30 16:53:44
It currently costs only a couple of dollars to create a brand new digital asset on Counterparty, and it'll soon be completely free: 
@_date: 2014-11-12 16:50:21
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:11:25
We'll update to PoC7 very soon. ;)
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:00:06
We didn't receive any e-mail from Ethereum when we announced that we had ported their smart contracts system to Counterparty. We do communicate regularly however, as we're all working towards the same goal.
@_date: 2014-11-17 16:46:46
Sidechains still seem to be a long way off. Once we see the tech start to materialize, we'll be in a better position to see the exact level of involvement Counterparty should have with the technology. As it is, there are several big security concerns we have with sidechains (merged mining, etc) that will need to be clarified/resolved. Counterparty can run on a sidechain, but there is a major security advantage to running on mainnet, especially for the lower-frequency, higher value type financial transactions that are our target.
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:48:57
Cross-posted from the other thread:
This patch doesn't block Counterparty transactions, which are now using a much more sophisticated method for encoding data in the blockchain. Generally speaking, it is simply impossible to block Counterparty:  Counterparty transactions are theoretically indistinguishable from other Bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2014-10-21 23:06:38
First of all, this problem is completely avoidable if B references an output of Transaction 1 in Transaction 2. Second, this has nothing to do with mobile wallets.
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:02:04
I don't want to speak on Gavin's behalf, but I imagine that he was referring primarily to network security issues that Ethereum will have creating their own blockchain technology from scratch. Securing the smart contracts virtual machine is actually relatively easy to do (the whole thing is maybe 1000 lines of Python). There is a fee for absolutely every contract computation and storage operation, so SPAM won't be possible. The exact fee amount will certainly change with the value of XCP, so that the cost of computation stays at the appropriate level, and computation remains reasonably priced. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:22:18
All else being equal, faster transaction times mean *less* security, actually.
@_date: 2014-11-17 16:03:36
XCP isn't really an altcoin, as it's not an alternative to BTC and BTC can be used directly within the Counterparty protocol for many things. However, much of Counterparty's advanced functionality simply requires the existence of a new currency that is "aware" of the new features. This includes the new smart contract functionality, where XCP is used to fuel the execution of these contracts.
Sidechains are highly theoretical and still have major security concerns. However, if these problems can somehow be overcome, we'd certainly consider moving to a sidechain.
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:47:51
Yeah, that all sounds great! Thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-12 16:54:22
It's compatible with the latest version of pyethereum.
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:46:40
You'd have to ask the Armory devs about that. ;)
@_date: 2014-11-17 20:54:40
Not yet, no.
@_date: 2014-04-07 17:39:39
It was never a real problem. Counterparty supports OP_RETURN, and would prefer to use it, but it works without it.
@_date: 2014-10-09 23:29:20
The 0.5 XCP issuance anti-spam fee is entirely temporary. Moreover, in the near-term, we'll be switching the fee to be proportional to the total money supply (`xcp_fee = 0.5 * (money_supply/2.6*10**7`)), so that it'll be impossble for the XCP ever to 'run out'.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:08:21
That's not really up to us, sorry! We're happy to work with exchanges to add support for XCP and Counterparty assets, certainly.
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:54:35
It's already there as part of the fee system. :)

Those links are broken for me. Yes, I'm helping Koinify handle funds for the Gems crowdsale. I did sign a message with my PGP key saying so.
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:25:32
Of course we won't put the contract code on mainnet until we're certain that we can maintain consensus. Plus, we've put a lot of additional consensus checks in the reference client recently (using checkpoints, etc.).

There's no way that XCP can be considered a security (I'm not a lawyer, but I've spoken to many who are). The creation of XCP by burning BTC is just like the creation of BTC by mining (i.e. burning energy).
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:22:01
Definitely. That's some really exciting technology, and I can't wait until it's ready for widespread use.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:34:03
Sorry I didn't answer your question the first time! Yes, it's possible. You can do a lot with the current token system, but if that's not enough for you, use write up a smart contract that does whatever you like. See also 
@_date: 2014-11-17 16:13:04
Writing the contract is the easy part. ;)
@_date: 2014-10-21 23:08:04
And that security model is perfectly compatible with Counterparty. (In fact Counterwallet already does it with HTML 5 and client-side Javascript.)
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:01:23
Counterparty can now do anything that Ethereum can! Namecoin, SchellingCoin, pegged assets, distributed voting, decentralized storage, and really distributed apps of any kind.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:35:30
I don't know if I would characterise the dialogue that exists as 'competitive'. ;)
@_date: 2014-11-17 16:00:22
The Counterparty smart contracts system is really the same thing as the Ethereum one: an infinitely powerful programming language for writing decentralized applications of any kind. Moreover, they're designed to be nearly 100% compatible, so that any code you write for one platform will be immediately executable on the other.
Colored coins simply isn't a powerful-enough protocol to implement a smart contracts system. [To quote Peter Todd](


@_date: 2014-11-12 23:54:07
I wasn't at all ridiculing Ethereum (which is a great project for which I have much admiration). I was just pointing out that their blockchain and currency are unnecessary for their smart contracts system.
@_date: 2014-11-12 16:47:04
We recreated all of the functionality, but without the new (unnecessary) blockchain and currency.
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:57:41
Writing new code doesn't change the protocol... only getting people to run new code does. Creating new XCP will simply never happen, just as only 21 million BTC will ever be mined.
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:49:27
The two big differences are: 1) Counterparty is on an established and secure blockchain, and 2) Counterparty contracts will be Bitcoin-aware.
@_date: 2014-10-22 15:59:34
Also from his Twitter feed:
"Read the sidechains paper. Interesting how 2-way-pegs can be a regulatory dodge: avoid a currency with a tech hack, at cost of peg BTC theft" 
"Advantage for regulators w/ sidechains is that you can shutdown and seize a MM chain's funds with a few calls to pools. [1/2]" 
"Or better yet, if pools are outsourcing validation to blockstream for scalability force blockstream too. I wouldn't want to be them! [2/2]" 
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:42:14
The whole system is designed from the ground up so that such discrepancies aren't possible. (Just like with Bitcoin itself.)
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:23:59
It just means that you use the same exact contract code in both systems. (You won't have to *run* each contract on both platforms, however.)
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:05:33
All of the relevant code is on [GitHub]( and there's a description of the fee system in [our announcement post]( All scripts pay fees for their execution, so there can't be any scam scripts.
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:04:27
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:12:32
Using any one of a variety of methods. (Prunable) multi-sig is the default though, yes.
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:49:32
Unfortunately, you can't do this sort of thing with BTC directly.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:02:52
Of course. (As long as it's legal in your jurisdiction.)
Right now the most popular Counterparty wallet is [Counterwallet](counterwallet.io), but I know that a number of other user-friendly wallets are soon to be released.
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:02:46
No, there shouldn't be any problem. With any smart contracts system, all nodes need to run all contracts, and Counterparty is designed to be able to run a very large number.
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:50:07
That sounds really interesting! A good place to start is [our developer documentation](
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:30:31
All of the functionality!
@_date: 2014-11-12 20:32:22
I think the point is that now Counterparty is a "*decentralized application programming, deployment and utilization platform which will enable developers to build any 'features' they can conceive of*" as well.
To address some of the more concrete points:
* The 10 minute block time of Bitcoin isn't a weakness, but a strength.
* There is no centralization problem with Bitcoin that Ethereum itself will not face, but magnified because it is starting from scratch. There simply doesn't exist a viable alternative to proof-of-work (except proof-of-burn, of course ;)).
* No auxillary, centralized data store is used to store the contracts. Everything is built directly on top of Bitcoin.
* We'll obviously be porting or developing our own versions of all auxillary applications for Counterparty. Building decentralized applications on Counterparty will be just as fast and easy as building them on the (scheduled) Ethereum platform.
We never said that Ethereum wasn't possible, that sidechains would kill anything, or anything else like that. This is a very real step forward.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:01:27
Hmm, I can't think of a good one off the top of my head. Sorry!
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:19:36
A proper asset reputation system is an excellent use-case for the smart contracts platform. A lot of smart people are already working on solving this problem. I know that BlockScan already has a system set up: 
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:45:46
Vitalik wrote a good response [here](
Other than that, I can say that the smart contracts system will be used to make the code even more modular and flexible than it already is.
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:38:01
This patch doesn't block Counterparty transactions, which are now using a much more sophisticated method for encoding data in the blockchain. Generally speaking, it is simply impossible to block Counterparty:  Counterparty transactions are theoretically indistinguishable from other Bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2014-11-12 19:22:45
Every operation has an XCP fee associated with it (destroyed at the moment of computation), so contracts can't run indefinitely. (This was a great innovation by Ethereum.)
@_date: 2014-11-12 19:10:02
Our contract system is based off of the most recent version of pyethereum, and we'll always use the latest version of the Ethereum contract language.
Also, the Overstock project to create a decentralized stock market will actually be using the Counterparty platform directly (that Wired article doesn't make that point very clearly).
@_date: 2014-10-06 22:31:05
Yep, that's it!
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:53:47
Yes. Counterpartyd includes support for parsing zero-confirmation transactions (from the Bitcoin Core mempool). This would allow an e-commerce application the ability to determine when a user has appeared to send their payment, pending confirmation.
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:30:19
The contract will fit in Bitcoin very easily, and BTC trading is entirely practical (just not with a web wallet with that particular security model).
@_date: 2014-11-17 16:53:44
Yes :)
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:17:48
The official announcement: 
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:26:06
Bitcoin scripts are executed by all Bitcoin full nodes. Counterparty contract code is stored in the Bitcoin blockchain and executed by all Counterparty nodes (that is, computers running counterpartyd).
@_date: 2014-10-22 17:01:14
 sometimes it's hard to read irony in tweets. :)
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:07:09
That depends on what you mean. Medici will be built using the Counterparty platform, however, and Counterparty's native currency is XCP.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:06:01
I don't think that's a very good characterization of the situation. As a rule, we have worked very productively side-by-side with the Bitcoin Core devs for over eleven months now, and while we don't always agree about specific technical matters, that hasn't affected how Counterparty has grown at all. I don't think it ever will, either.
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:58:28
Absolutely, but it really isn't our place to speak on their behalf.
@_date: 2014-08-04 00:57:09
Colored Coins are *nearly* irrelevant because of Counterparty. The **only** actual advantage that Colored Coins has over Counterparty is that it is output-based, and so is compatible with SPV. But SPV just isn't very important: if you're willing to use a system like P2Ptrade, then you should be willing to use a similar system for serving copies of the blockchain (and then only when you *want* to).
Otherwise, centralized systems like p2ptrade would work just as well for Counterparty as it does for Colored Coins, and anything Colored Coins can do, so can Counterparty. Moreover, the development efforts for Colored Coins are indeed slow and fragmented, and ChromaWallet is not nearly as stable or mature as counterpartyd or Counterwallet.
Of course, none of this speaks to the infinitely greater functionality which Counterparty supports, and which Colored Coins never can. Colored Coins is a clever idea and solid computer science, but not actually a very powerful or useful protocol. There's a reason why it has been largly unused for so long. :-/
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:00:55
The beauty of Counterparty is the freedom it affords users to do things that its creators never even dreamed of!
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:54:39
Yes, Medici is a business venture of Overstock's. Beyond that, one really can't say yet! :)
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:19:34
There are lots of different kinds of light clients, and Counterparty supports all of them except for SPV ones. There's always some trade-offs that have to be made, and we think that building on the Bitcoin blockchain is more than worth it.
All of the data is stored in the blockchain, (but prunably, so that Bitcoin clients that  don't use it can delete it).
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:28:53
We recently added the ability (live in a couple of weeks) to create Counterparty assets for only a minimal BTC transaction fee.
A bartering algorithm would definitely be possible using the scripting system, and would be very cool! 
And thanks for the support. :)
@_date: 2014-11-12 19:35:23
Those are user-created assets that have nothing to do with this functionality.

We have not been very closely involved, unfortunately. There are only so many hours in the day. :/

What Counterparty does is it extends the functionality of Bitcoin beyond that of a mere payment protocol, and into the much larger realm of general peer-to-peer finance, trade, and smart contracts.
@_date: 2014-10-09 23:34:04
Counterparty is an entirely open protocol: 
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:51:51
Counterparty does not store files in the blockchain. Nor does it need support in Bitcoin Core for it to work perfectly.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:24:48
The fees are actually distributed to the holders of XCP, in proportion to the size of their holdings. This is the simplest and most robust way of handling it, and it works such that those that are receiving the fees are also the most incentivised keep the system running smoothly.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:41:21
Counterparty isn't very monolithic at all, and the smart contracts system will allow us to make it even less so when we move existing functionality into it.
@_date: 2015-08-04 21:10:06
The article left out the important point that it not proof of existence or even a token system, but a complete smart contracts ('smart securities') platform. If it were anything else, there'd be no automatic dividend payments, conversions, cap table management, etc.
@_date: 2015-03-13 11:33:09
All major mining pools mine all Counterparty transactions, last I checked.
There simply isn't a good alternative now to ten minute block times, if you want to build a production system.
@_date: 2015-03-13 11:26:32
* Counterparty testnet runs on Bitcoin testnet.
* Counterparty uses the Bitcoin blockchain.
* Counterparty has been live on mainnet for fourteen months now.
* Counterparty uses the same system as Ethereum here, but there are definitely classes of contracts for which it is entirely reasonable to calculate the necessary expenditure of coins. If there are coins leftover after the calculation, they are returned to the user. (This feature is part of the reason you need a new currency.)
* Counterparty had no "ICO". No funds at all were raised.
* N/A
The contracts system works fine with 10min block times. There's no reason it shouldn't. (It's been up on Bitcoin testnet now for a couple of months.)
@_date: 2015-03-16 02:57:57
This is incorrect: Robby and Evan left Overstock voluntarily, and recent statements by Overstock.com (notably by Judd Bagley) affirm that they'll be building Medici primarily on top of Counterparty.
@_date: 2015-02-02 14:36:21
N.B. the build system will be completely phased out in the next version (v9.49.4), due to be released this week.
@_date: 2015-02-02 14:30:50
No, the old build system does not support Ubuntu 12.04. Yes, the documentation was somewhat out of date, as we were in the middle of a major migration which is now near completion:  Pretty much everything else in this post is false or terribly misleading. He had his engine executing shell commands to interact with the server instead making of proper API calls. (Yes, that's slower!) He was running all of his software on one server with no virtual machines, etc.
@_date: 2015-02-02 14:37:26
Um, Counterparty doesn't send out marketing e-mails...
Some functionality has been disabled in Counterwallet for purely legal concerns (the foundation hosts it). It all works in the protocol.

You only need XCP for certain 'advanced features' that wouldn't be possible to use with BTC, e.g. Turing-Complete smart contracts
