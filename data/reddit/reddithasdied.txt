Yet another reason New York is a cesspool.

Stop eating paste. It might slow down the brain cell depletion.
@_date: 2019-07-31 22:57:12
Did you ever actually go to those protests, or did you watch some documentary that linked the Occupy Wall Street movement with Bitcoin and concluded they actually made a difference in the world?
@_date: 2019-07-30 13:23:04
I keep it all on Coinbase. I trust them with everything.
@_date: 2019-07-29 05:16:01
That’s shitty. Too many cash withdrawals or bitcoin withdrawals?
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:58:50
Robinhood does send out all your buys and sells at the end of the year or just before tax season (can’t remember exactly when).
But just remember... you don’t actually own any of the crypto you buy there. If Robinhood goes under, so does your crypto.
@_date: 2019-07-31 22:30:16
We never recovered from 2008.

If you’ve invested a decent amount,I’d put it on a hard wallet and put it in a small fire safe. Ledger is easy enough. Just withdraw from Coinbase/Gemini’s BTC wallet address to your hard wallet’s BTC address. There’s a handful of YouTube videos that break down that entire process - if that helps.
There is no reason to leave funds on an exchange wallet for long periods of time. Exchanges can go out of business. Exchanges can be hacked. Both of which have happened and the BTC is gone for good.
If you don’t wanna go through the whole hard wallet process, you can always store on something like Exodus or Jaxx - I guess. They’re free applications on your computer, but it still leaves your BTC susceptible to hackers. Just google “Jaxx wallet hacked” or “exodus wallet hacked.” I used to use Exodus and although I was never hacked, the idea of my funds magically disappearing just because I didn’t throw $80 towards a ledger and safe just didn’t sit right with me.
Put your funds on a hard wallet.

Tomorrow evening.
@_date: 2019-07-24 19:38:44
Imagine still not buying now though. At least scarcity hasn’t reached its ugly head yet. You won’t be one the clowns scrambling for BTC when the price has reached unattainable heights.
@_date: 2019-07-25 19:37:25
Only on Reddit do you find people this brain dead.

It’s always going to be laggy since it’s based in Tor. There isn’t much you can do about that... for now.

Send it to him. What could go wrong?
@_date: 2019-07-22 23:27:01
Yes you do. Any P2P exchange is riddled with scammers. You just have to choose the right traders.

It’s Reddit, after all. This place is littered with retards.
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:54:07
Robinhood is the most centralized you can use. You cannot even withdraw from their platform since you do not even own your crypto there. Their crypto trading is solely based upon speculation.
Unless you just wanna make some gains into fiat and you do not really care about the long term future of Bitcoin or similar assets, do not use Robinhood.
@_date: 2019-07-21 18:10:48
Illinois is heading there as well.

At least you will have all that useful USD to wipe your ass with.

So this subreddit is littered with economically illiterate manchildren then?
@_date: 2019-07-26 11:00:57
Not required. You can simply use the link from the Lolli website to your desired merchant website - if you don’t want to use the extension.
@_date: 2019-07-17 20:15:20
I hope you don’t leave the BTC in the exchange wallets.
@_date: 2019-07-28 11:54:03
There’s something very similar to that called RoundlyX. It uses your spare change - like Acorns - and auto-buys your desired crypto on Coinbase once you hit $50.
@_date: 2019-07-24 17:29:58
Hope this fucker gets shot in the face.
@_date: 2019-07-22 04:47:20
If you’re looking to buy with a credit card, use Abra. They have a 4% fee right now. Pre-paid debit is almost strictly P2P exchanges like Paxful or LBC.
@_date: 2019-07-31 12:12:47
Yeah. You can say that again.
@_date: 2019-07-31 10:12:13

Finally a funny meme on this subreddit
@_date: 2019-11-06 01:44:41
Sending millions to "re-education camps" for being muslim, stealing &amp; not innovating anything in eons, social credit system, no freedom of speech, and a population that has to abide by it all or die.  
But you know... It is what it is.  
Also, fuck you.

"he dont like bernie. dat mean he like trump."

Ok. Then stop fucking voting in politicians who want to expand government to every field imaginable.
@_date: 2019-08-03 03:33:38
Don't confuse buying stocks on Robinhood with buying crypto on Robinhood. Verizon acknowledges your purchase and there still would be a way to get your stocks in the event Robinhood goes out of business or gets hacked. What happens in this scenario with "your" Bitcoin? You either fight in the legal system for your original investment or lose everything. I get it. Robinhood seems like a great way to combine stocks, bonds, and crypto all in one. No bouncing between different apps. Unfortunately, this isn't the case. Buy Bitcoin on a site where you can withdraw it. Why put your faith in someone else to hold your Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-08-02 23:26:51

Only p2p and you’re going to be paying a 20% premium.
You’re better off using Prepaid2Cash app to get fiat and buying Bitcoin. They charge a fee around 5-8%.
@_date: 2019-08-06 10:08:17
nah. i made the mistake of joining that shit hole and quickly realized a bunch of retards fisting themselves to their inferior shitcoin, BitcoinTrash
@_date: 2019-08-02 23:39:17
I blame the media and the activist op-ed writers (non journalists) they hired that really drove this narrative.
@_date: 2019-08-08 18:33:33

If you think Reddit is a free speech platform, you are rudely mistaken. They also have a progressive-liberal bias.
@_date: 2019-08-19 05:34:28
It’s more along the lines of everything - including yourself - thinks what you do is in the bottom right picture.
@_date: 2019-08-04 03:28:25
If you're using Chase, it's not possible. They will block your purchase regardless of what exchange you use (and most use Simplex, so they know to block it). Also, you incur foreign transaction fees with most credit card companies because of Simplex.
If you want to buy Bitcoin with a credit card, you might have to pay an even heftier premium (15%-20%) by using [iPayYou.io]( or [Purse.io]( do a lot of purchases on [Purse.io]( to eventually get down to 5-10%. You basically buy people's wish list on Amazon with whatever payment method you can use on Amazon (gift card balance, credit card, debit card)
@_date: 2019-10-08 09:32:13
Yes. Let’s use both children to prop up our ideologies!!
Fucking shameful.

@_date: 2019-08-05 22:53:08
Nope, but there are a handful of vendors on LBC and Paxful that do that.
@_date: 2019-08-09 16:15:02

@_date: 2019-08-02 23:37:11
Like you’re doing right now. You’re bashing Gab because you read on Vox - or some other shitty non-journalist site - that Gab = nazism. And now you want to say “nah man. Free speech is cool, brah.”

Shiiit. I loved Dope Wars. Gotta give this a try.

@_date: 2019-10-08 09:32:50
Go away.
@_date: 2019-10-04 19:27:06
It will only solve these problems once confirmations can be settled within seconds. I’m not saying it’s not possible in the future but no business nor customer wants to wait 40 minutes to buy something.

@_date: 2019-08-02 23:25:53
The comment section is why Reddit is dog shit.
Free speech = nazism, I guess
The amount of people in this subreddit that “support” Bitcoin but want free speech limited is pretty hilarious.

Stop listening to Bernie Sanders talking points and actually research what socialism is.
You literally have no idea what you’re talking about.
