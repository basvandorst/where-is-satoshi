Follow up question, what hardware wallet is considered the fastest, most secure and user friendly? Cant get a clear answer after a week of research.

Those are sheep. You dont buy at peaks unless you are damn certain of something. This is a dip.

Do you still have coin invested?
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:22:00
Exactly. You still have faith in the venture. Say you invested in Google in the early days and it hit a little trouble but you had full faith in the search engine they were designing. You wouldn't run away, you would continue to support the company you are invested in, because you still have confidence in the companies abilities.  Same thing applies here.

Really? Yeah it does. If those statements hold true. Ford "is a good car company, its automotive engineering is really good and will likely get better..." Ford "designs good cars and its brand and consistency hold tremendous value." 
Ie. You should invest in good products that are improving. This is a good product that has done well, the product continues to improve and innovate. You should invest in this product. 
Your not as clever as you think you are. Your comment implies all the protocols fit that description, which they all dont.

Lol you are not nearly as clever as you think you are.
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:27:51
Ahh, so you have no faith in the tech. Just here for the lolz. You should sell this is clearly not for you.

How many bitcoins does this produce a month on average?
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:14:48
I didn't buy at 19k.

Obviously, what your money does effects everyone. What a silly thing to say.

Your last sentence is trying to say something, but it isnt really. The protocol is good and will likely get better. Sure, first is not always best, but your argument doesn't disprove that Bitcoin is good tech and that it's brand and consistency hold tremendous value. Everyone has heard of bitcoin, some people have heard of other alts, but mostly bitcoin. Bit coin has the best chance of success if they deal with scale-ability issues.

By nature of hodling you wouldn't be spending on lambos. Your own investments increase your own coins value.

and how difficult would it be for a layman with basic computer knowledge to be able to put a system like this together. Not considering cost?
