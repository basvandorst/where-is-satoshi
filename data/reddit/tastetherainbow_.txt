you have to pay taxes on your profit, so best case scenario 15% long term capital gains. you have to gain that 15% back in your trade to just break even.

you hold until it moons, then you establish your residence in Puerto Rico, and then after 5-10 years your gains are tax free. But capital gains taxes aren't even that high, 15-18% Depending on how much you cash out per year.

I've had the same thought. Currently the merchant doesn't need to hold any bitcoin to realize the benefits. What if they provide a similar service for consumers. You would deposit fiat which they would hold and only convert it into bitcoin when you want to make a transaction. Mass adoption while keeping the actual demand of bitcoin low.
