This video is clearly a joke and anyone who thinks this is legit needs to be familiar with tech before putting their money into it based on this. And what do you mean upvote anyone who buys it? You believe this is intentionally created to trick people? Rofl, this would be the worse form of propaganda.
What does it matter if the thread was posting on r/btc first?
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:11:56
Hahahahaha. You have no clue if LN works or not. Lmao

This sounds like your mempool. I actually thought that's what this meme was for before I read the title.....

Altcoin discussion isn't allowed. How this thread is getting away with it is beyond me.

I'm sure he didn't mean BCash.  And ok, I'll interview you and call you Trevor the entire time because I like it better.

Users choose Segwit depending on the wallet they use.  Companies choose Segwit by choosing to upgrade their wallets and services to utilize Segwit. They send a certain piece of iinformation out if they are running it which is how others know. The purpose of Segwit is to be optional, yet a lot of users act like it will solve all problems and threaten boycotting companies for refusing to implement the optional upgrade, because of the resources, risks, and whether the upgrade is worth it.
The lightening network requires segwit, anyone not running Segwit will not be running LN and will still use the original BTC tech.
They signal their intention to support the upgrade by changing a bit in the information they receive, a different number represents a different intention. The problem is that with softforks such as Segwit, the users and miners really have no choice or say in any decisions. With hard forks they have the option to refuse, aka consensus, many say this is why core opposes hard forks and claims they are dangerous, they arent.

They were both physical objects priced based on their usability, not speculation. No one think they needed a cell phone 20 years ago and most wouldn't have bought one because it wasn't necessary, until people were USING them everyday.

Yeah you shouldn't be buying BCash, I wouldn't buy futures in a coin that's not released yet.. some time in 2018, idk. But you should really try Bitcoin Cash, it's pretty great!
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:55:56
Your first point makes no sense. Cleary the entire community doesn't support Segwit or it would be live on Coinbase already. You're killing your own point.
Can any idiots stop bringing up BCH? It had nothing to do with this guy talking about segwit2x or the OP about core shills. These trolls always seem to somehow bring the conversation back to BCH and make ridiculous slanderous claims with no proof.
You don't know what coinbase was in support of so shut up. Segwit does nothing but increase blocksize by 10% xD. Further, it's yet to be proven 2x, BCH, or "Co" is a scam, if you have evidence prove it or you're trash shill who is only worth 1 fake comment.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:51:18
No one is smearing Bitcoin, Core is smearing BCH with this stupid name shit.

That's what happens when you force a fork people dont want. They have the ability to upgrade or not. This is concensus and EXACTLY how other coins fork off a main chain.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:15:32
"Because it's not enforced."
Because it's an optional upgrade that this thread and Twitter feel the need to threaten boycotting the company for what they were told they can upgrade to or not.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:06:05
"Activation of the Segwit hardfork is optional."

Point is, you've now lost the only exchange calling it BCash. Learn it's real name and focus on your own coin. This is pathetic. Watch this topic become pinned or my comment removed ha.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:57:35
That's true, they are less costly, but not enough, and even Coinbases support will hardly make a dent in the current issues.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:32:48
How do you feel Now? You could have made another 200% and you sold it. Rofl.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:21:46
It will still cost you almost the amount in transaction fees  regardless of where you go. It's not Coinbases fault Bitcoins mempool is backed up. Coinbase going to SW wouldn't relieve 150k transactions in the mempool and it wouldn't help it's current probably because coinbase doesn't represent 90% of the entire cryptomarket volume. 1MB blocksize, with SW currently implemented it's at 1.1MB and did almost nothing. Coinbase wouldn't even bring it to 1.15Mb.
Good lucky moving your BTC on the blockchain, hope it doesn't cost the same or take as long to move it (since the issue will probably carry to your new wallet)
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:30:32
At least when you buy those other coins you get them quickly and with low fees.

To be fair you are telling them to invest at the ATH and you misunderstand key parts of corrections and that there are way more than just the one or two dips so far. Those aren't corrections 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:31:43
It says you can't actually buy it until liquidity forms on GDAX, which will take a couple hours.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:53:31
Uhm? You'd never know anything bad core says since they just delete everything controversial. At least Roger leaves his thread and is transparent .
You remember a week ago when Adam said everyone should boycott Coinbase and BitPay for not implementing Segwit? Ha nice consensus there. Giving people an option and then forcing a crowd to attack their business for not going along with the "right" choice according to core.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:27:59
Market cap for BTC over all crypto used to be 90%, now it's 50%
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:44:49
There has been no opinions posted on Bitfinex besides the previous political motivation of using a purposefully wrong and insulting name, which in turns confuses buyers because Bcash doesn't exist.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:29:39
Except that people buy it with money for a price..... lol
