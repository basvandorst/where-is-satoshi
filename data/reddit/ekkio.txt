Giving miners ability to decrease block size is a bad idea because it creates a possible scenario where miners decrease and lock block size to drive up fees.
An analogy with a monopoly is very apt because the same type of behavior is used to maximize profits with minimal effort , and it won't matter that it hurts long term chances for bitcoin survival, it would increase miners profit in short and mid term.
An important thing to understand is that a for profit business generally doesn't care about long term possibilities, usually it only cares how to do less and get more profit now.
Miners won't need to upgrade their infrastructure to accommodate increasing load and stay competitive, all they would need to do is to vote for block size decrease.
A conspiracy would be undetectable to public because it would be possible to justify block size decrease with sounding reasons, it would be like having a monopoly company complaining about costs of production, and no one knows for sure what the actual costs are until there is free market that lets other people to try to deliver a better and cheaper service.
Currently a miner can create a small block but it's impossible to force others to do the same. The original proposal doesn't give miners the ability to decrease maximum block size and since it can move in only one direction sometime increase will happen for one reason or another even if miners generally would not like to see that happening, and that is fine because technology will improve and bandwidth costs will go down.

In 1876 the President of the Telegraph Company (ancestor of Western Union), Chauncey M. DePew, appointed a committee to investigate an offer of telephone patent. Below is a quote from the report.

Correct me if I am wrong, but all those previous ideas were about pre-announcing transactions that would go into next block and this idea is as old as computer science itself. 
The bit that will make it work for bitcoin is to use proof of work of near miss blocks as anti-spam and anti-spoof measure when pre-announcing transactions for the next block and it seems Gavin was the first to realize that because it is not mentioned in Rusty Russell's transcript.

It's down in the [comments]( in the ethereum sub

The answer is that 95% of people feel very uncomfortable and try to avoid making hard decisions.
And deciding to invest or not to invest is a hard decision because a person has to be prepared to handle any outcome.

No, I meant that pools on Bitcoin network can execute 51% attack to invalidate everyone else's work while still constructing valid blocks with correct transactions, technically from a user perspective Bitcoin network will continue to operate and he might not even notice it, but pools will drive competitors out and almost double their bitcoin earnings.

I actually agree, we will see what's going to happen, but I am optimistic that it will turn out to be ["good enough"]( .

But if value goes up people get upset because they didn't invest more, regardless of how much they invested.

How about a more practical way.
Let's say two people make accountable predictions which contradict each other. Eventually one of them was proven right and that's the persons who knows how things really work and the one you should trust, and it doesn't matter how many long words the other one used to explain his idea.

Is Ethereum in bubble, sure. What would be the lowest point after the bubble pops?... You have a 50/50 chance to end up on the right side of it.

No, the price won't drop because from users perspective nothing changed much, transaction are still going through, users will just have to trust pool operators not to double spend it. It won't be painless for pull operators to pull off but for a lot of people that trust would be ok, and with some PR work I think it's possible, not that I support it, to the contrary I think it would be a huge detriment to Bitcoin in the long run.

Make it 28hr, in case someone would need a constant uplink for a week or so, therefore it would be possible to make the payment **roughly** at the same time every day.

Well, think about benefits of centralization /sarcasm , e.g. pools can prevent transactions with tainted coins. I am sure it is possible to come up with many other additional arguments.

If you think that the OP is a victim then you should stop using Bitcoin, it's not suitable for that kind of mentality, in other words there is no safety labels in bitcoin world.

A lot of people will hate Bitcoin because they won't want to learn how to use it, and because of that wealth will be transferred from those people. In which category do you fall?
@_date: 2013-06-11 18:26:52
This exactly what I thought after reading the article. Price of a coin driven by demand side only because the supply side is constant, so this tactic to drive competitors out won't affect the price by much, several major pools on Bitcoin Network can pull it off as well.

It might be a teaser about transferring bitcoins using just a cellular network, e.g. GSM
