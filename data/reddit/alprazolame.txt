No, you wouldn't have lost anything if you were paying even minimal attention to events during the months before the collapse. There was an avalanche of warning signs: website lag so you couldn't trade, seizure of Mt Gox funds in US by DOJ, their inability to process withdrawals, and the list goes on.
I remember arguing incessantly on Bitcointalk for people to abandon ship before it was too late, but so many suffered from a lack of imagination.
Some of them were so militant in Gox's defense that I was sure it was an astroturfing campaign by Gox to buy time. When it all did collapse, I was genuinely shocked at how many seemingly intelligent people kept their money there despite the obvious red flags.

There's no such thing as a "legal audit" from the perspective of accountants. It would be more accurate to say that according to the letter released by Tether, there wasn't a full audit done in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
When it comes to something as simple as verifying the assets held in bank accounts, no accounting firm is going to put their name on any report that misstates those assets, so I wouldn't dismiss the Tether report completely. Chances are high that those funds did exist on the date of the report.
There is, of course, always the possibility of a massive fraud by management. For instance, they could shift funds between entities to create the illusion that Tether holds assets that were actually subject to other claims. Since the auditors were not engaged to do a full audit, this type of fraud would likely go undetected.
Is such a massive fraud likely? Everyone will have to make up their own minds on that and act accordingly.

@_date: 2014-03-27 21:23:58
Yes, exactly. The problem is all on the consumer side as users have to track their cost basis and recognize gains when spending coins.
Consumer wallet providers, like Coinbase, can make this simple by building it right into the wallet.

I believe he must have, otherwise they would have just taken the BTC back from his account. They probably charged his credit card because he withdrew the BTC, which casts doubt on the validity of his entire complaint.
@_date: 2014-01-30 07:01:34
Right. Because mistakes in the legacy financial system are completely unheard of!
It appears from his post that OP saw the 20BTC and removed it from his Coinbase wallet thinking he got away with something. When Coinbase accounting finally caught up with him and charged him for the product he withdrew, he posts a screed that makes it seem like he has clean hands.
An honest person would have left the BTC in the account and waited for them to inevitably be removed. It may have been Coinbase's mistake, and their support may not have handled it well, but that doesn't mean OP is not also partially responsible for his situation.

I've never personally had this problem with Coinbase but I certainly wouldn't appreciate the email you sent him. It's poorly worded and needlessly insulting as it implies that the good of the company and "the community" are more important than the person actually paying for your service.
Worse, the lack of any recourse for the customer is completely unacceptable and the suggestion that he "might have more luck" in a few weeks makes the entire business model seem like a farce. Why should anyone need "luck" when trying to make a purchase?
Angry posts by upset customers can seem needlessly inflammatory but when fealty to the "machine learning algorithm" trumps the needs of the customer you really do have a problem.

I imagine they'll still have to complete the ID / KYC profiles to redeem the cards and trade. I don't have an account with OK or BTCChina, but I was required to complete the KYC information before trading was even allowed on Huobi.
I do agree with your larger point... the PBOC wants to make it difficult to bridge the exchanges and the existing financial system. It looks like this will continue to be a game of cat and mouse until the exchanges are forced to move offshore.

You'll get no argument from me there. They clearly have dropped the ball on support staffing levels. Coinbase has to do a much better job, and the "we're growing too fast" excuse won't work for much longer.
Still, making a fraud complaint to to financial institution when there is no fraud is itself illegal. People should be careful about these things.

They will hound you for 10 years to collect, seize assets, etc., but you don't go to jail for failure to pay tax due, assuming there was no fraud involved.
OP should immediately hire a tax attorney to deal with the IRS, and file amended returns based on recent guidance for taxation of bitcoin. The amounts due for CPU mining activities should be small, assuming he hasn't cashed out those coins. If he has sold and not declared that income either, it's still better to file completely legit, amended returns reporting ALL of his income regardless of his ability to pay.
Tax collection activities will be inconvenient, but tax fraud can land you in jail.

Corporations are just groups of people and customers are not always right. Don't be emotional, look at the facts.
The salient point in this matter is that OP withdrew BTC that he knew wasn't his. By withdrawing the BTC he created a situation where Coinbase couldn't simply take the BTC back. He behaved in a manner consistent with someone who wanted to purchase BTC and is now upset that he has to pay for it.

They don't sync with the blockchain. You generate your keys offline, then fund one or more of the BTC addresses provided. Your electrum installation won't know the balances of those addresses as it's not synced, hence the need for a separate watch only wallet.

With regard to point number 1:


The Ripple investigation made no findings against Mr. Ver. He is not on the OFAC list and is therefore not subject to preemptive disqualification. Did your attorney find otherwise? This is suspect.
Secondly, whether or not the contract specifically cited the correct legal entity, OKCoin paid Mr. Ver and acknowledges that an agreement was in place. Your conduct (payment to Mr. Ver) confirms that you were aware  of the contract, so the erroneous name is irrelevant and appears to only be a tactic to rescind after the fact.

If CZ's allegations are true, it was not virtuous to sit on them while depositor and investor funds were at risk. The fact that he has come forward only now, at this late date, to support his friend in a contract dispute does not exactly cast him in a favorable light.

In other words, the funds are held in aggregate in a FDIC insured bank and the FDIC would rely on the records of the pass through entity to determine payout limits in the case of failure.
@_date: 2016-01-23 07:11:06


But many of them have communicated the case for the core vision... eloquently and convincingly, in my opinion. Can anyone reasonably claim that Greg Maxwell, for instance, isn't a competent communicator?
So that leaves "consensus building." Since the vast majority of active devs support the core vision, the only consensus yet to be built is with those who seem to reject their concerns about the effect a block size increase may have on decentralization and censorship resistance.
That philosophical difference isn't so easy to overcome, especially when there is so much money at stake. So, my question to you is, what, specifically should the core devs do to convince the big block crowd, considering that they are unpaid, overworked, and exhausted from all of the attacks on their motives?
@_date: 2016-01-28 12:08:20


I guess we're at loggerheads because you're talking in circles and missing the point. If it's a defining principle, not meant to be changed, it requires no silly vote. Bitcoin exists... you don't get to vote on the coin cap FFS.

I realize that bit of tortured verbosity above is your attempt at damage control, but it's a whole lotta bunk.
I don't care how many know-nothings click a link on some guy's website, the coin cap is inviolate, or it isn't bitcoin.
For jtoomim to acknowledge it as an idea that could ever be taken seriously, if only it garners enough "upvotes," is preposterous and embarrassing. Having it out there for a vote makes the entire Classic project look foolish and entirely minor league.

I don't think you fully appreciate the number of large bitcoin holders with an unfavorable view of this classic nonsense.

@_date: 2016-02-07 09:49:32
Yes, you should if you are looking at this rationally.
There are some very angry large holders who do not intend to tolerate a hostile attack. The price is going to take an extended trip downward to extract a large penalty from miners should they seem to be supporting this nonsense.

It is hard to imagine that trying to save yourself the hassle of dealing with intrusive government paperwork is an actual FELONY, but that's the world we live in.

I definitely agree that many blockchain tx's are just the shifting of coins among a user's own "accounts," but you also have to keep in mind that there are a lot of off chain transactions taking place. Just in terms of gambling, Just-Dice.com's bet volume far exceeds that of Satoshi Dice and it is all "off chain" after the initial deposit.

Don't let this experience with your parents harm your work ethic, because it can be one of the most important assets you have.
Nowadays there are hundreds of ways to make money online, and with Bitcoin, you don't even need a PayPal account to receive payment.
I don't know your skill set, but you could set up blogs, facebook pages, and websites for people locally or find clients online. You'd be surprised at how many things there are that you think are "easy" or common knowledge that older people don't have time to learn.
Try to think of a micro business you could start on your own... being an entrepreneur is one of the most rewarding things you can do, and you'll learn things that just aren't taught in school.
Here's a tip to get you started. :)

Yes, financial institutions lose money in that case, but there would never have been widespread credit card adoption without indemnification of consumer losses. I think the banks make out OK on the deal.

I didn't miss it, I just interpret it differently.
We can parse the language all day, but I stand by my contention that being a money transmitter requires the transfer of money between third parties. Anything else is ridiculous on it's face.
That said, someone else posted that Gox did allow transfer of cash codes between people at some point in the past, and I acknowledge that significantly weakens the argument I laid out in the OP.

It wouldn't surprise me at all if the entrenched players in the money transmission space actually lobby for more and more onerous regulations to raise the barriers to entry.
However, at least with regard to FinCen, this is just a registration, not a license. I believe they grant it to all who apply, because it's just a way to get you into their database and complying with their reporting requirements. Here's the link to the application: 
P.S. I lived in Florida for a while and apparently there are only so many liquor licenses issued per county, based on population or something.

That's ridiculous. There's certainly nothing fraudulent about it and no person should face jail time for failure to file one of the thousands of government forms. At most they are guilty of negligence.
I agree they probably should have registered, but since the LLC subsidiary in the U.S. doesn't actually act as an exchange OR meet the common definition of a money transmitter (Dwolla does that part), they may not have thought it applied to them.


Wow, that's an incredible position. Is the point of the government to create "gotcha" laws that ensnare honest people trying to do business? A quick chat would have brought them into compliance and made everyone happy.

Perhaps because network hashrate is not directly observable you prefer to use mining difficulty as a makeshift measure of network security, but it is rather imprecise.
Both of the attacks you mention require control of more than half of the network hashrate, regardless of the level of mining difficulty.
Anyway, that wasn't what I was referring to in my comment. Rising difficulty is sometimes confused with increased safety of a particular person's wallet, or in this case their "fortune," which is generally a function of the security and strength of the private key.

Money transmitters are businesses setup to transmit money between members of the public. Neither the FinCen guidance, nor anything else I've read, indicate that a business transacting with customers directly is acting as a transmitter.

It really is a shame that even minimal customer service seems a luxury in the Bitcoin world. I'm glad to hear that Blockchain made things right, but it really shouldn't take public shaming to get companies to pay attention.

Take some time to examine why you think it's OK for a fiduciary to cower and hide, but ridicule and look down on the people who want to know what happened to their money. If you don't find some clarity on this, you'll turn out to be just another mediocre human being with a mediocre business.

It doesn't appear that you actually had that 880k+ in your account at all prior to the debit. Is there a large deposit that isn't showing in that screenshot?

Bitcoin is still barely a blip on the radar of any offline market, or for that matter, any online market outside of, perhaps, controlled substances.

If you don't fill out the form, and are searched, they actually seize your money and you face further fines and imprisonment for up to 10 years. There are tons of stories about innocent people getting caught up in this racket and losing everything.
Now they have [proposed regulations]( that would apply the reporting requirement to gift cards, prepaid access cards, and cell phones.

I think it's great. Kids should have chores, and beyond the basics of cleaning up after themselves, there's no reason not to reward them.
Allowances help kids learn that resources are limited and the tradeoffs involved in spending now vs. saving for something they really want. When I was a kid, it always seemed like the wanting and saving was more enjoyable than the getting anyway.
This has the bonus of teaching them about Bitcoin. Nice job Mom. :)

I've made several withdrawals from Coinbase to my personal BOA account this month with no problems yet. I also made several purchases through the same account over the summer.
That said,  I have read about others having trouble with BOA and Bitcoin, but I don't believe they involved Coinbase. I think it's a good idea to have a back up checking account just in case... you can never predict when you're number will come up.

For the truly paranoid:

3. Send LTC from cryptsy.com to btc-e.com.
4. Trade LTC for BTC.
5. Send BTC from btc-e.com to Electrum wallet.
This method costs a bit, but it's mostly foolproof.
If you are less paranoid, you can simplify this a great deal by just depositing your coins on an exchange, waiting a while for their hot wallet to be refilled with other coins, and then withdraw.

Not at all. Those 'advanced predictions' are the business itself. Customers pay insurers to indemnify them and pay out claims when required, but insurance companies are actually in the business of managing risk (underwriting) and investments.
They certainly have reserves, as they generally operate on an enormous float, but that doesn't diminish the importance of the actuarial science behind the setting of premiums and the acceptance of risk.

I think there's a difference between state and federal definitions of the term "money transmitter." Coinbase claims they aren't a transmitter for state purposes, but they have registered as one with FinCen.

You definitely have options. You can sue him in small claims court, in which case you don't need a lawyer, but you'd better have your case laid out so a judge with no bitcoin knowledge can understand it.
I believe Roman and the company reside in NY city so you would have to sue there, and the [limit on claims is $5000]( If Roman doesn't show up, and you prove your case, you'll have a judgment you can execute against his (or the company's) assets, etc. If he does show, you get to look him in the eye. :)
You could also locate others in the same position and try to find a class action firm to take the case. The problem here is that they are not going to want to bother because Roman probably doesn't have the assets to make it all worthwhile.
Depending on where you live, it may be cost prohibitive to even go the small claims route, since you'll have to travel there for trial, etc. But if you are close by, or you just want some justice, it might be worth pursuing.

No, it won't destroy them but it usually has an effect on the price, and in some cases, the responsiveness of their servers (campBX).
When someone moves BTC to a smaller exchange, they can only sell it to another customer on that exchange who already has funds on deposit. The money is there, but it can cause price imbalances when it all happens quickly.

I disagree. Even under your scenario, Mt. Gox is doing the transmitting, not Mutum.
You can't argue that a transfer from Mutum to Mt. Gox counts as a transmission of money on the one hand, and then say they are the same entity for purposes of transmission between client accounts on Mt. Gox.

How about a virtual machine on your existing computer that doesn't go online? It comes down to the fact that computers that connect to the Internet are all, at least theoretically, at risk of picking up malware of some sort.
I personally like [Electrum]( which doesn't require back ups because it creates all of your private keys from the initial passphrase, which it also creates for you (called a [deterministic wallet]( As long as you have the passphrase you can recreate your wallet on any computer, even if your current disk dies. Be sure to make an offline copy of your passphrase though.
Again, Electrum on it's own can't save you from a virus or keylogger, etc.

I have an intellectual starch blocker that prevents me from agreeing that this or that should be taxed, but I enjoy my freedom, so I'll keep paying until I take up residence on Bitcoin island. :)
That said, people who argue that bitcoins should be taxed probably don't understand how taxation (in the U.S.) works. The reality is that bitcoins are already subject to income tax, as is everything you do that earns a profit or accrues a financial benefit.
It is incumbent on you to report your gains when you sell bitcoins for more than you paid, and "selling" also means using them to purchase goods or services.
Maybe your friends think they should also be subject to sales tax, but that's a different argument entirely, and one I disagree with strongly.

There's no doubt that bitcoin needs leaders to build out services and infrastructure, but his suggestion of a "central bank" is absurd and unworkable.
No entity will ever be able to act as a central bank and directly control the bitcoin monetary supply, so what he is really suggesting is that large holders collude to manipulate the price. This may already be happening, but it doesn't sound like a recipe for widespread confidence and mainstream adoption.
Bitcoin plus central banking simply wouldn't be bitcoin anymore.

There might be some efficiencies to be had in the collection and payment of premiums, but that's hardly what's difficult about being an insurer. Figuring out which risks to accept and how to price them is the hard part.
And that's only half of what insurance companies do. Investment of the premium float is the other important bit, and without it, the business is far less viable. Insurers may incur underwriting losses (claims exceed premiums) in some years but still turn a profit due to investment income.
Insurance really isn't just a reverse lottery; in the case of life insurance, for instance, everyone loses (wins?). It's more of a pooling and pricing of risk.
Anyway, I'm a huge fan of Bitcoin, and I agree that the focus should be on its advantages over traditional currencies rather than the opportunity for speculation. That's not to say that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed the recent run up in price.
@_date: 2013-09-01 05:34:46

There is no such thing as evil... it's all in your head.
No one should be under any illusion that theymos is a paragon of fairness. He's human like the rest of us and therefore subject to the same confirmation bias.
Anyway, you were probably banned because you are a rather annoying egotist who insists on ceaselessly prattling on about your victimhood. No one cares because it is all quite petty.
Someday, when you learn to deal with your own cognitive dissonance, and stop with the "fighting evil" nonsense, your mind may open enough to handle these situations before they spiral out of control.
Even now there are things you could probably do to get back on the forum but you so are locked into your own myopia that you can't let go of being the victim long enough to get what you really want. Calling theymos evil will certainly not work.

You seem to be misunderstanding the term "market cap," which is calculated by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the most recent price. Previous sales have no bearing on market cap; only the most recent one is relevant because it gives the reference price.
Hopefully this doesn't confuse the issue even more, but in the interests of accuracy, the term "market cap" really only makes sense in the realm of company shares. The more accurate term for Bitcoin, and other currencies, is "monetary base."

Hey, I've got most of my $ in bitcoin and btc investments but there is absolutely no way to honestly characterize them as non-speculative.
These kinds of over the top claims don't help anyone, and investors shouldn't let ideology get in the way of common sense. Bitcoin is in no way, or by any measure, less speculative than the US dollar.
@_date: 2013-05-14 20:33:28
No, I don't think its less reliable than the others and I'm not arguing about Armory.
I initially said that even tech savvy people are losing their coins and you shot back that these people couldn't possibly be tech savvy because they don't use Armory. I simply pointed out that Armory isn't the panacea you make it out to be.
Anyway, it's still my contention that there is currently no EASY way for busy, non tech-savvy consumers to keep and use Bitcoins, and we need those people for mass adoption. I have no idea why you think that's controversial, but we seem to have different ideas about what the average person is willing to risk and endure to use Bitcoin.

Assuming you can actually protect yourself from fraud and stay in the good graces of your acquiring bank, I think you would do quite well, even at the 10% fee.
Buying Bitcoins is a high friction endeavor, and most people just aren't going to bother jumping through the hoops. The service you describe may not be too appealing to the Bitcoin early adopters on this subreddit, but it could help get BTC into the hands of a large new market of people with just a casual interest, and these are exactly the people we need for widespread BTC adoption.
That said, I do wonder if you can really ever prevent "friendly fraud" because, as you know, it is very difficult for the merchant to prevail in a "card not present" chargeback unless it uses Verified by Visa or its MasterCard equivalent.
All in all, I'd love to see this service go live.

MSB licensing happens solely at the state level, and is completely separate from the Fincen guidance. Fincen requires a registration, not a license, as well as adherence to their anti money laundering regs.
In other words, 50 state MSB registration was certainly contemplated when the agreement was signed... in fact, I think it was the primary motivation for Gox to get into bed with Coinlab.

Coinbase is still faster than Dwolla / CampBX in my experience, and once you are verified for instant purchases on Coinbase, it's a no brainer.

You misunderstand. It was never ***illegal*** to charge a different price for cash and credit. Merchants agreed to that rule in their contracts with the card service associations. It was a business decision that allowed them to access a pool of cardholders who appreciate the convenience and tend to purchase more.
If you were *compelled* to pay more at all, it was by the merchants you patronize, not the credit card associations with which you don't do business.
Also, I never said the losses were free or harmless, so I'm not sure why you put those terms in quotations. The point is that banks wanted widespread credit card use and understood that they would have to protect consumers to achieve it.
@_date: 2013-06-21 21:14:53

I know quite a bit about it as I lived ~60 blocks away at the time. Needless to say, it held my attention for quite a while.
As for downgrading my argument, well, there isn't an argument to be had. It's my money, and I don't intend to see it indirectly diverted it to someone who, IMO, is taking advantage of the credulous and the undiscerning.
I'm also not interested in rehashing old, thoroughly debunked, conspiracy theories, pumped up by charlatans or the misguided. A certain cohort seem predisposed to these theories, and similar to the devoutly religious, it does absolutely no good to argue with them. Humans generally dislike uncertainty, and sometimes the void is filled with bunk. C'est la vie.
Any problems you have with the official story can be fully researched thanks to Google, and you can draw your own conclusions. Just keep in mind that correlation does not imply causation, and that the cherry picking of facts to suit a pre-conceived argument is the modus operandi of many of the people pushing these theories.

I think all the hate is because he's laying this rap on Bitcoin as if the kind of resource allocation he decries isn't happening millions of times a day the world over.
Even if we accept the unproven premise that allocating resources to SETI over Bitcoin is a net benefit to society, his argument could apply to any resource (cash, expertise, time) invested into an enterprise that might be considered "wasteful" or extravagant when compared to a greater need. How about $3 bottled water, $60 video games, or $100 cosmetics?
It's facile to beat up on Bitcoin because human altruistic impulses don't exceed our completely legitimate desire to better our own lives.

Each additional person who joins the network adds a multitude of possible connections, thereby making the system more useful / valuable overall. This is frequently called the "network effect" or even "bandwagon effect."
In the case of a digital currency, or a social network, the value is strongly related to the size of the network, and when one becomes very large, it acts as a barrier to entry for competitors.

If you hold the coins for more than one year before selling you pay a lower rate of tax... the long term rate. When you trade back for USD in under a year, you pay the higher, short term rate.
Depending on the amounts in question you might want to seek professional assistance, but typically capital gains are included on Schedule D of the US tax return.
If you are trading coins as a business, you could use Schedule C, which will also will allow you to write off other business expenses (Internet, computer, etc.).
Either way, keep good records of purchases and sales, and make sure to include the income somewhere on your return and you'll be fine.
