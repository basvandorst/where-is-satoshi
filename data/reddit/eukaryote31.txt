To add to that: remember that your transaction fee is paying for 400 bytes (approx) of storage on *every single node* for *all of perpetuity*. Since power cost increases with time, at some point in the future someone else's transaction fee will also be paying for the cost of storing your transaction. That sort of becomes a problem when transaction fees are really low. You need to process either exponentially more transactions or exponentially higher fees to keep the system alive in the long term.

@_date: 2017-12-31 15:29:17
No, but somehow those nodes have to be paid for. Most of the time this is because the nodes are pools and they make the money through fees, but the problem is that the cost of storage is a linear term and transaction fees are a constant term.

It's not "just" 21 trillion, there's also unfunded obligations, which, depending on who you ask, can vary wildly between $70 trillion and $200 trillion. Basically, it's also effectively debt, but it's not really called debt so we don't usually think about it.

Supply and demand: the cheapest power must be the power that's overproduced. You can moderate the production of coal power closely and the price of coal is stable, so the price of coal power is nearly constant. Hydroelectric dams built to anticipate future dwellings are sometimes bad bets and then they become huge wastes of resources, discouraging people from building them because of the relative risk involved. People building power plants want them close to the areas they provide to, because transporting power costs a lot.

The ELI5 version: The cheapest places to mine bitcoin are the places with cheapest electricity. The places with cheapest electricity usually produce more electricity than is needed. The power plants that produce more power than is needed usually are hydro or wind or solar, because you can't just decide when to turn them on or off. By using this electricity, we are using it to secure bitcoin instead and make money instead of wasting power. This encourages planners to build clean power, because they know if nobody is using the power, then miners will and they'll always be able to sell their power instead of just wasting it.

You've literally taken a smart contract and removed the decentralized, censorship resistant, immutable, trustless parts of it.

Then your system is not a smart contract system, it is just a normal cloud service that offers an easy blockchain interface. A smart contract's defining characteristic is censorship resistance and the ability to execute code without anyone being able to cancel or modify it. With smart contracts, Code is Law. There is no such thing as an illegal contract. As long as a contract pays sufficient fees, it MUST be allowed to execute exactly as is. And that is what your centralized, faux smart contract platform lacks. And that is what defines smart contracts in the first place.

Bitcoin (and all stocks/cryptos) is a really big hidden-state system. The prices are only an observation of the current equilibrium in the system, not even close to the entire system.
