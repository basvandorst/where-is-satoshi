The title of your post: "Bitcoin's one magical property is that it can be transported over a communications channel"


Bank transfers for me are both free for the sender and the receiver
I can also send money to Paypal or Google Wallet or whatever for free and then send that money onto others for free (both to me and them).
Contrast that with Bitcoin, where I have to pay an exchange's arbitrage/fees (or a Bitcoin 'ATM' fee), escrow fees, and a fee on every transaction to make sure it goes through (transaction fees are going to keep increasing, to make up for reward halving and to prevent blockchain bloat).
There's nothing 'magical' about sending money over the internet bro

That's interesting, because from that figure we can estimate some other figures:
$0.0023/GH x 1000GH/s = $2.30 per 1000GH/s per day
If we assume 1GH/1W efficiency and an electricity cost of $0.10/kWh, then that's $2.40 per day.
Assuming they have a lower electricity cost though, say $0.05/kWh, then that means the efficiency of the machines they are turning off are 1GH/2W, which is equivalent to Antiminer S1s.
Either way, it's looking like any further deterioration in the price is going to result in a catastrophic collapse in the hash rate, since no mining machine exists that can break even on electricity cost at ~$50-$100.
Bitcoiners has before claimed that miners wouldn't stop mining even if it was the rational decision for them, because it would constitute an existential threat to Bitcoin which they would never allow to happen.
Well folks, what's happening speaks for itself. Cex.io is turning off their miners. Now ZeusHash. Who's next? You can bet your bottom dollar that at ~$100/BTC a majority of miners will fold, and you'll probably get a catastrophic 99%+ collapse in the network hash rate.

Mining machines that do 1W/GH are among the top 10 or so in efficiency. For instance a supposed miner posted here a day or two ago saying he was using Cointerra Terraminers, and they use 1600W for 1600GH/s.
There is no mining machine I know of that can do 0.5W/GH or better (Titanium ASIC is apparently vaporware), and only 5 machines can do better than 1W/GH


I'm just doing a calculation based on Zeushash's statement. If they're running 0.5W/GH miners at under $0.05/kWh as you say, then they shouldn't have a break even point of $0.0023/GH. It's unlikely they're being dishonest, because if they are, why stop mining contracts? That's just losing them revenue if they're above break even point.
In regards to the places you cite, do you have any sources to back up your claim with hard figures? Does Venezuela have a stable electricity supply for miners?


How would you do that without opening Pandora's box? If you reset the difficulty to '1', 50,000 BTC could be mined in a matter of minutes, and then you'd have the whipsaw effect as difficulty tries to adjust with miners taking as much advantage of it as they can.

Why would they cease mining contracts if they are above break-even point? That's willingly forgoing profit
If anything, the mining contracts have allowed their machines to remain on longer than they were profitable, because Zeushash would be making extra revenue from the mining contract buyers to make up for the losses.
The network hash rate is currently down 20% from the peak a few days ago. The hash rate is currently lower than what it was back in parts of October, November and December.

It doesn't cost me a single cent to make a debit card payment through my bank.
I deposit money into the bank, that's free.
I make an online transaction using my debit card, perhaps for some takeaway from DeliveryHero. That's also free.
And that's all there is to it.
But you didn't respond to the guy's point, which is that you claimed Bitcoin is unique because it is currency that can be sent over the internet, yet dollars are already sent over the internet.

Nope, the difficulty won't drop because a 99% drop in hash rate within a 2 week window would mean blocks take 16.66 hours to be found.
Time to difficulty retarget is 2016 blocks, so:
16.66 hours x 2016 blocks = 3.8 years
