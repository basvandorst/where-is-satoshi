This is a great concept! One small nitpick however is that the screw is accessible from the bottom side. I believe someone could spot weld (pass high current through the metal) a rod to lengthen the screw enough to back it out from the other side, grab your seed words, put it back together, cut off the rod, and restore the screw to similar appearance. I would also like to see instructions on how to break the tamper evident seal when you need your seed back. Do you just mangle it with a vice?

Hard but not impossible. A skilled machinist could do it without marks. I couldn't. If the threaded hole didn't go all the way through it would be significantly harder still. It's a nit pick though and not an issue when you've split your key across three places.

What I especially like about this idea is that your approach would work for existing ATMs too. You'd lose the user specific features like balances and out of network transactions if the user didn't have internet access while at the ATM, but it's core functionality would still work.

The machine that accepts the cash gets a pre-assigned secret key. The actual currency exchange doesn't occur until the user connects to the website of the company running the machine. The user is basically proving to the website that they put money into a machine (or hacked into the machine and stole the secret code.) Internet access is still required, but only the user needs it, not the machine itself.

The user still connects to the website (presumably of the company running the ATM) to make the bitcoin exchange. But the ATM machine itself can receive and dispense cash without an internet connection.

Think about it instead as stealing the machine's secret key. Only that machine will be compromised, not all of them. They need to be relatively secure machines anyways since they've got cash in them. Sure, a secure ATM can still get broken into, but that's a risk already at play with existing machines. At presumably your server side implementation mitigates per machine risk with safe guards like standard fraud detection techniques.

It may run at 10 watts while it's changing bills, but with a very low duty cycle. Well implemented, that component is off nearly all the time except when you're changing bills.

The bitcoin exchange itself occurs when the user connects to the internet. That is the point at which the exchange rate is determined.

In my world, this is a glorified calculator solar panel:

I am saying this because there are solar powered parking meters everywhere in my town with tiny solar panels that power money changers, screens, cellular radios, etc...
De-humidifying air is much more analogous to refrigeration and you're not going to find fridges easy to power off solar either (I have done that, and a lot of batteries and solar panels were involved.)

Considering security tokens can run years on coin cell batteries, and shuffling bills inside a machine can't be all the power intensive, glorified solar calculator cells could probably do it.
