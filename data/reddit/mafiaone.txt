My 65 year old mom bought in back at $1000, and yesterday she told me "Looks like I can afford another bitcoin.  I see this going one of two ways, this is either going to take off or its going to zero, so might as well buy in again now."
My mom is going to the moon with me.

Let me get this straight.  You want to create a list of people who own more than 3000 BTC?  This sounds like an absolute disaster.  Even if your intentions happen to be good, there is a lot of damage that could be done if that list fell in the wrong hands.
My advice is that if you have ~3000 BTC avoid this post like the plague.

IMHO the best possible solution for this is to have Bitpay require that the buyer also include a refund address at the time of purchase.  This would certainly speed up and help automate issues such as these that require their support team.

They walked the CEO of WorldCom away in hand cuffs.  When they walk the CEO of Bitcoin away in handcuffs I will see your comparison.  luckily our CEO is on the moon, so they will have to follow us to the moon to get him.

I played Hold'em during the poker boom, and during my hours of play I developed a new kind of mindset that allows me to absorb losses in value like these without batting an eye.
When you know it is a good bet you stick in there.  Winning or losing doesn't matter on a single hand because it is always a bad idea to get up from a profitable table.

I just joined the group and I have been meaning to come.  I am not sure if I can make it to the meeting this week, but I would love to in the near future.  
Nonetheless here is an upvote for good measure!

I just checked out your homepage and I am excited about this site.  I have been waiting a long time for a major poker site that launches accepting BTC!  When I finally get my money from the FTP payout expect me to become a regular on your site.  Cheers!
