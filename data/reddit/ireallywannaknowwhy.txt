It seems you are intentionally trying not to understand.  Forget bout satoshi's vision.  This is 2nd layer.  There is no possible way for satoshi's to have 'envisioned' this kind of tech.  You ascribe way to much to the poor fellow.  If you don't want to participate in technology moving forward, that is fine.  Don't use it.  Trying to hold back the tide with a Luddite-satoshi's-vision-stalemate is futile.  There is nothing villainous about this ensuing flood of new tech.  Learn to code.

Not a transaction that was 'agreed' to, but a previous state.  This is very simple tasking with automation and the penalty is not worth it.  It is indeed the trustlessness embedded in the transaction because a bad actor will get punished.  It is the same mechanism that keeps miners honest.

The 'bank' idea is flawed.  A 'bank' implies 'accounts'.  There are no 'accounts' in LN.  Anyone can run an node inexpensively.  Try opening a real bank.  Many road blocks.  The same can be said now for mining bitcoin.  You would need vast resources and a very good negotiating stance with the only manufacturer of mining equipment who you would be competing with directly..

Bitcoin cash appears to have support from a very amateurish group on reddit.  Elsewhere support is elusive at best.  It appears to be entirely controlled and manipulated by a small mining cartel that controls a lot of hashrate and as such the chain is in jeopardy of minimal adoption and use, as it removes trustlessness.  My conclusion comes from watching the numbers and communicating with the bitcoin cash community.

'Tax fraud'.  The true power we have as individuals is non-compliance.  Even a term such as 'tax fraud' smacks of totalitarianism.

Normally in a chain split  it is the most valid chain (in terms of consensus rules) that has the most Proof-Of-Work that continues. It could be either chain. Bitcoin cash forked (changed consensus rules from the majority) and survived because the code base was altered to include an Emergency-Difficulty-Adjustment and replay protection, thus in essence a whole new coin.

Bitcoin cash is suffering.  Adoption is lagging mostly due to miner centralisation of the chain and user client development, not to mention the hobbychain attitude that surrounds it.  It is just a tool for miners to milk hashrate swings by gaming the EDA.  The data don't lie.

It is also what the market has decided the utility for bitcoin is; an easily transferable store of value/wealth held on a decentralised distributed immutable blockchain/ledger.

@_date: 2017-10-25 23:20:24
Certainly slower as a currency and more expensive in transaction fees, heaps of power struggles that usually accompany value, many forks not because it is shit but because others are vying for speculative utility, less centralised and more distributed than any other crypto with more secured hashrate by very large orders of magnitude.  The reason is:  the market has decided that the over arching UTILITY for bitcoin is as 'an easily transferable store of value/wealth held on a decentralised distributed immutable blockchain/ledger'.  Other utility including the original peer-to-peer-cash utility remains elusive at best for ALL crypto currencies.  This is why bitcoin is king and will always remain as the central bank of value in crypto, as the space matures and develops.  Think a bit deeper about how ground breaking all of this really is.

No 8mb won't be enough.  Furthermore, at 1 block every 10min. Transaction speed will never be able to compete with efficient centralisation.  Peer to peer cash can only happen utilising second layer tech on the bitcoin blockchain.  Luckily the market has decided that bitcoins greatest utility is as an easily transferable store of value/wealth on a decentralised distributed immutable blockchain/ledger, which currently can support such utility, further developments, or utility speculation will need to come on increased abstraction layers.

The market I refer to is the current tangible market, not future predictions.  Bitcoin will not be replaced by a store of value, because that is where the utility lies, it is in the value that has been created.  And 'other bitcoins'?  There is only one bitcoin,  you've been had.  As far as 'emotionally' defending 'my coin', you are trying to be antagonistic, as it is you who is relying on emotional arguments, bitcoin is the only crypto that has true market value currently, that is why the other cryptos are based on it at exchanges etc.  it's the market/users that have decided that, nothing else.  Think deeper about this, it's not an emotional my coin against your coin kind of thing here, just the facts of where current utility lies vs what utility is speculated on in the development of alts.

First world problems.
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:19:35
1) An agreement, instead of a proposal: the NYA narrative framed the situation as a scaling gridlock that needed be solved, thus an agreement between relevant actors (developers, miners, exchanges, payment processors) was sought after. But the very nature of an “agreement” between a few parties in a decentralized consensus protocol can be interpreted as an aggression against the network. Bitcoin’s governance model is certainly not perfect, nonetheless it is far from dysfunctional. If a proposed change lacks adherence, status quo remains. That is a strength. Difficulty in changing the protocol — especially when affecting the consensus layer — really is a feature to be commended. BIP stands for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, there is no Bitcoin Improvement Agreement for the simple reason that users cannot and should not be coerced into adopting unwanted changes to the protocol. As a community, we should strive to propose, educate, and convince. Overriding the governance mechanisms through closed agreements does not foster unity.
2) Lack of development and objective transparency: from the onset, there was a clear deficiency of transparency and clarity from the leading S2X’s developers. Countless cases of interested parties being barred from freely subscribing to the mailing list, or accessing the slack channel, were verified. That cannot be considered open participation. Although this has somewhat been resolved, it contributed to confusion and suspicion, resulting in many parties simply distrusting or not believing SegWit2x true intentions. In the end, we are left wondering if NYA is genuinely about Bitcoin scaling or simply a subterfuge for a “governance takeover”, if the latter was even possible. Moreover, participation was encouraged only on the basis of obedience to a pre-agreed upon decision. If the technical and security merits of a “2mb hardfork in 3 months” are not permitted to be discussed, participating seems a sterile exercise.
3) Political compromise, instead of technical upgrade: it has been frequently stated that SegWit2x represented a compromise. Immediate activation of SegWit (BIP141), as many users desired (by conservative measures over 70% of full nodes were already running SegWit ready software by then), and an increase in base blocksize limit to 2mb, as desired by miners and in accordance with an alleged agreement made during the Hong Kong Scaling Conference — though such an agreement was nothing more than a few developers promising to do research and make an open code proposal. A compromise in a decentralized consensus protocol poses a grave problem as it shows little regard for the technical consequences on the whole network. Changes impacting the consensus layer should not be adopted based on accords simply because some participants (be it miners, or merchants, or developers) are insisting on them. It is immensely difficult to make the case this isn’t a politically motivated change, one which has little to do with technological enhancements of the network. If Bitcoin’s protocol can be altered by the sheer pressure of select participants, it means decentralized consensus has failed. It means Bitcoin cannot and will not withstand even greater attacks in the future. To assert that S2X, if successful, sets a bad precedent is a gross understatement.
4) Consensus imposition, instead of consensus building: as a decentralized free open-source software, changes to bitcoin’s protocol cannot be forced upon users of the network. As previously argued, had the proponents of S2X merely proposed a change, engaged in open and truthful debate, the divisive situation could have been avoided in its entirety. If upgrades are in fact needed, let us build consensus around them.
5) Replay protection and unnecessary disruption: this was perhaps one of the most controversial stances by the S2X developing team. The outright refusal, followed by persistent reluctance, to implement strong replay protection gave a sense of recklessness to the entire community. It seems, at times, that S2X aims at deliberately causing disruption in the expectation users will capitulate and end up upgrading to its incompatible implementation. This posture undermines S2X’s own credibility as a legitimate attempt to improve the protocol.
6) Emphasis on mining to the detriment of users: trust is an emergent property where multiple parties must act in strict conformity to the rules or risk consensus failure. Consensus is achieved by: i) full nodes independently validating transactions, ii) miners aggregating transactions into a block and producing a proof of work, iii) full nodes verifying miners’ blocks, and iv) full nodes selecting the longest valid chain. Seeking majority hashpower as a means to demonstrate consensus is pointless. Miners provide an essential service to the network, but they do not determine consensus. Mining does not define what the rules are. Full nodes enforce rules and defend the network against arbitrary changes by rejecting invalid transactions or blocks. If miners did have the sole power of affecting protocol changes at their own discretion, Bitcoin wouldn’t be a robust and secure network.
7) Impatience over prudence: hardforking, by definition, means breaking backwards compatibility. Hardforking without consensus guarantees a chain split. For a network worth billions of dollars being used by millions of users, allowing for sufficient planning, testing, and preparation should be a self-imposed best practice. Unfortunately, S2X’s implementation (btc1 core) adopted a hasty timeline for activating a hardfork, risking leaving a significant portion of users adrift. Additionally, the so-called “quiet period” before the date of activation makes S2X all the more worrying. We would have preferred to see the risk of a chain split being mitigated by open and intensive testing instead. Downplaying backwards compatibility and security issues makes us extremely uneasy about running btc1 core software.
8) A non-solution to a perceived problem: we obviously prefer low fees to high fees, faster confirmations than longer confirmations, but simply raising base blocksize limit to 2mb now is a partial solution at best. As acknowledged by the very proponents of S2X, even 2mb is considered already insufficient and further increases should be implemented soon. If that is the case, does S2X plan on hardforking every 3 or 6 or 12 months? Congestion in the network is not a fundamentally technical problem to Bitcoin’s protocol. It certainly prevents some use cases in the short term, but does not imperil the network’s functionality and utility. We believe preserving Bitcoin’s censorship-resistant properties should be a top priority in protocol development.
9) Externalizing risks, network and market turmoil and potential liabilities: the chances of a chain split overburden exchanges, payment processors, and wallet services that must plan, prepare, and support a new coin in the event of a permanent split, encumbering these third-parties with potential liabilities should they refrain from doing so. Furthermore, it causes network turmoil by requiring participants to take extra precautions prior to the fork to safeguard wallets and by exposing users to possible loss of funds. Averting disorder in the network should be a prime concern in protocol upgrades, it is unfortunate to realize S2X might accomplish the very opposite. Lastly, uncertainty originated from S2X tends to reverberate negatively in the markets affecting asset prices across cryptocurrencies in general.
10) Misleading miners: it seems that miners have been misled into signing to a promise that overwhelming agreement in the network would be achieved. But since this is clearly not the case, if miners do run btc1 core, they endanger their operations by mining a chain the majority of users will invalidate. A more prudent approach would have been to recommend miners to “execute a hardfork if the signs of consensus in the network are unequivocal”, but never “do hardfork at all costs”.
11) Misleading statements by some proponents: unfortunately, companies we do admire and have business with have released misleading statements regarding S2X inadvertently withholding crucial information from its users about what is really at play in the network. Everyone is free to choose the software they want to run, but customers should be rightfully informed if its service provider is adopting an incompatible implementation and what the risks are. We believe sooner or later upgrades to the protocol will necessitate a hardfork. With due planning and preparation the network can smoothly coordinate to effectuate such changes with minimal chances of chain split and disruption. That, however, requires time, education and testing. Governance in a free open-source software is a complex business and some parties become frustrated by the lack of agility or ability to upgrade the protocol. Roadmaps, promises, and compromises are innocuous in a decentralized consensus network where no entity or group of actors can unilaterally dictate and enforce rules at will. We are all part of consensus. For all the reasons above, the Brazilian and Argentinian Bitcoin communities stand in opposition to SegWit2x. We consider any potential benefit arising from a hardfork as per the NYA is not worth the risks. Therefore, we urge its proponents to discontinue this endeavor and reengage the community towards a healthy and collaborative process for improving Bitcoin’s protocol.

The above comes from an article ithat s rather concise about why the market/users are not convinced about 2x (as opposed to the companies and their boards, which those users are a part of), this comes from outside the USA centric space, where most of bitcoin is actually used.

Isn't there more than one developer?
@_date: 2017-09-10 12:07:43
With persistence, a chain split, EDA, and centralised hashpower.
@_date: 2017-09-25 23:07:17
Because the large mining operations can make much more from the larger blocks, but smaller operations get sliced out of the market.  This increases centralisation for a very few.  No?
@_date: 2017-10-01 11:03:43
That won't compile.

Cool.  Remember though that the market eventually decides utility.  Bitcoin is valued not for it's peer to peer cash network as much as it is valued as a decentralised immutable ledger that can transfer value/wealth.  This is new.  Other peer to peer cash systems exist and are used about as much or slightly more than bch.

This drive towards monopolising the chain is the only real threat to bitcoins anti-fragility, immutability.

This is disingenuous at best.  A few core devs, some from the beginning have formed a company together.  Other than that there are 100's more that aren't part of blockstream.  In fact one other company has more developers.  No?
@_date: 2017-10-06 07:37:06
Isn't it the other way around?  Hashrate is dedicated to s2x in terms of intention (signalling).  Am I looking at this wrong?
@_date: 2017-10-17 21:05:21
And there are groups that feel that a 1gb test block is reassurance that they can scale indefinitely on-chain, with no regard to what the would look like in terms of decentralisation and trustlessness.  So what?  It has nothing to do with the fact that this current chain split is a proposal to disarm bitcoin from the long standing development base, and install it with a chosen developer(s?).  How do you feel about that? Do you have much skin in the game?  Block size smokescreen arguments mean nothing when you do.

If there are changes to the input format at that point then the miners running the optimisation would just have to deal with that.  The would need to trust in the idea that things change and that their optimisations may in the future not function as intended, just as some of the protocols changed in the www standard so that old browsers can't use 'optimisations' that used to work.  Trustlessness goes both ways.
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:25:37
Does it matter?  If an 'upgrade' comes along that changes the input format, then using asicboost will produce an invalid hash.  Am I understanding this?  Meaning that they would need to consider the input format at that point.  No?
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:44:00
Hashrate signaling as intention?  Maybe.  But, remember there are users.  And users thus far have not signalled there support for 2x strongly enough to influence volume or price on several exchanges now offering futures.  In other words, users don't have faith in the 2x chain, and this is while the vast majority (more than 80%) of bitcoin transactions live off chain in exchanges.  This is by far the best indicator we have about market needs.  In the end folks, it's all about users, the rest is infrastructure and utility speculators.
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:52:12
Secures yes.  Miners also have validating nodes.  Validation of consensus rules happens by full nodes, which propagate valid blocks and transaction according to the rules.  Without this propagation of valid rules, nakamoto consensus is dead.  What you are actually trying to say is that you only want miners to propagate via the valid rules of consensus.  In other words you would like a centralised scenario in the end game.

Thanks.  I'll have a look.

What I do believe he is referring to is the undercurrent existent here of the community eating away at itself and being increasingly inward looking; isolationist if you will.  This could be described as a cancer.  Lift the game folks.  Bitcoin is bigger than @_date: 2017-10-21 13:56:13

What kind of protocol change can 'break' asicboost?  Would it be a change that is targeted to break it, or a by product of another protocol change?  And if it breaks, what happens to the hash produced when using asicboost?  Does it invalidate?
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:34:32
the only problem with your argument is that you aren't going deep enough.  Vtc etc. aren't regarded in UTILITY in the way that the market has decided what that utility should be.  Sure add all the bells and whistles you want, but if the market doesn't value it, then it is futile.
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:59:37
Go for it.  Think of it as putting/storing some value into a totally new form of asset.  Buy into dips and if you need it draw from it and replace as soon as you can.
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:43:55
I heard that blockstream owns bitcoin and has killed it by hampering innovation.
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:13:52
Nicely worded.  Another improvement/change that is being used that wasn't conceived of or thought about in the original white paper/vision.
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:02:53
I suspect that eventually only the newest coins being mined will be driving trading, as bitcoin seems to be following the rules as a limited supply commodity.
