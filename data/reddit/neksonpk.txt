Name that tune:
I am now a poor boy 
And my story's often told 
I have squandered my existence 
For a pocket full of bitcoins such are promises 
All lies and jests 
Still a man hears what he wants to hear 
And disregards the rest 
When I left my fiat currency 
I was no more than a boy 
In the company of strangers 
In the quiet of the trading market, running scared 
Laying low, seeking out the lowest prices 
Where the smartest people go 
Looking for the places only they would know 
Lie la lie ... 
Asking only miner's wages 
I went looking for a job 
But I got no offers, 
Just a come-on from the whores on Tibbane Avenue
I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome 
I took some comfort there 
Lie la lie ... 
Now I'm working out my P&amp;L 
And wishing I was gone 
Going home 
Where the Tokyo City fraudsters aren't bleeding me 
Bleeding me, going home 
In the clearing stands a goxxer 
And a blighter by his trade 
And he carries the reminders 
Of ev'ry frap that weighed him down 
Let's gut him till he cries out 
In his anger and his shame 
"I am leaving, I am leaving" 
'Cos the blighter still remains 
Lie la lie ...

In the UK merchants are now charged by most banks for paying in cash, so there is not much difference between cards &amp; cash to them - bitcoin would offer them real savings and hopefully they will pass some if not all of these savings on to the customer - don't know if this is the same in other countries - USA?

I understand the concept of mining new blocks and these being added to the blockchain using the previous block as the chaining mechanism, but what happens when all blocks are mined / is it possible to create a block yet only with transaction fees? If so, why aren't some miners / pools simply processing transactions?
Sorry this is probably a real noob question!

National populations re-enfranchised by referenda on all off manifesto items - e.g. an Iraq type war voted down despite volumes of pro-war propaganda

Cool looking - have you added bitcoin to your SEO data?
