There was a point in time years past when Facebook had hype, too. When you had to have a college  email address to sign up. After that all new users didn't know what it was, they just knew it was cool. There's a reason why the "Forwards From My Aunt" meme has relevance.
This is pure and simple. We should want more people using Bitcoin. The more people that join the network, the better for the value. It doesn't matter why right now. That will come later.
Bitcoin *is* an app. It's a messenger service. It allows you to send messages of financial value to usernames. It's like AIM but for money. It's absolutely an app.

You can sell your house for any kind of money or whatever you want. As part of a legal contract, in exchange for your property, the buying party must give *consideration* \- something of reasonably equal value. Usually currency.  
As far as the transfer of the ownership, the deed, note, survey, escrow, title insurance etc will be done the same way as it is for other residential transactions in your state.  
Also BTC, is volatile. What seems like a fair amount when you accept an offer may change dramatically by closing time.  
As a marketing tool to sell your house though, I say absolutely advertise it with Bitcoin!

Here's why I think Bitcoin will rocket past $25K in time:
 - Bitcoin's adoption rate is extremely low among the general public. As news of Bitcoin spreads, most people know one thing: it is skyrocketing in value.
 - As more people hear about Bitcoin, they will be enticed to buy. This will increase the value. There is an enormous sea of people who have yet to hear about Bitcoin.
 - Barring speculators, those "in the know" about Bitcoin buy to hodl. This keeps the currency illiquid, and therefore prone to being a bubble.
 - However, there's another segment of society who are also going to want Bitcoin as described in the previous-previous point: business owners.
 - They'll want to sell products/services for Bitcoin because they'll also want a piece of the action.
 - When businesses are faced with a hodling Bitcoin public, they'll have to make prices lower when *paid for in Bitcoin*. The market will reach a point where this discount is low enough to make it worth it to entice people to spend their Bitcoin. Businesses will be happy to do this because they'll believe that the Bitcoin they will be receiving will increase in value.
 - Bitcoin will be used increasingly as a currency, and it will be purchased by more and more people, and spent by more and more people.
 - Bitcoin is deflationary; since there is a limited amount of coins, and more and more people will want to buy them and spend them, the value will continue to skyrocket until it has reached an equilibrium adoption point with the population. We are so far away from that right now that it is safe to assume it will go way past $25K.

It matters if you are making purchases of Bitcoin measured in amounts of fiat rather than amounts of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-10 15:02:07
No because as you explained it's a form of payment that is reversible. Also, who has a credit limit of $70K?
I guess by your logic cash is a bad thing, too, because I can trick someone into giving me cash and then they can't get it back? Or ever heard of wire fraud? Your argument is ridiculous
@_date: 2018-03-11 21:42:27
All currencies are convertible. That's what they do. Is the US dollar worthless because I can convert it to the Japanese Yen? Or buy gold?
Your reasoning uses a defense of which Bitcoin was invented precisely to do away with. Fiat currency is backed by the faith of the government. That faith is dropping dramatically. Bitcoin asks for a new faith, one of open technology. It's a paradigm shift that you aren't seeing.

Jamie Dimon running his mouth and getting press for it, North Korea allegedly hacking exchanges, and rumors of China banning Bitcoin. The latter concerns me the most if true.
Though I wonder what China would then intend to do with all that Bitcoin in China... :P
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:47:32
Do you have a source for this? My friend said the ban was specifically about transferring wealth via BTC to the US. I deduce from that that other countries would be acceptable?
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:16:55
If you look at the four major upticks and dips over the past year, the crashes seem to stabilize at around 10% over the previous peak before starting to rise again.
The Dimon news and China news and NK news seems to be a big deal. Though, no matter what the news, I was waiting for this as history shows it would happen eventually. It just needed some news excuse to cause the dip.
I'm buying at $3,000.
@_date: 2017-09-24 00:15:24

@_date: 2017-09-13 12:49:27
I don't think the Chinese govt would want to just make so much of their own country's wealth disappear into the ether. If anything they'll try to gobble it up. That would take a lot of torturing though to get wallet seeds. I don't see it happening. They're just trying to scare people right now to get it under control.
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:57:56
Please read OP. He said they are not banning Bitcoin outright, only transfers to the US. So that would suggest that exchanges will remain open. Otherwise what does "banning" mean.
