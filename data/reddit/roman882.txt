then why use walletnotify at all?
@_date: 2017-04-09 03:50:31
why not? he should try.
@_date: 2017-04-05 18:40:12
ok. hence, zmq is the best option compared to walletnotify and calling  listtransactions each NN seconds or minutes, isn't it?
@_date: 2017-04-13 09:17:21
thanks. what's `-N`, should I replace it with an ip address?
@_date: 2017-04-10 00:00:14
since it's not merged yet, how can I achieve my goal now?
@_date: 2017-04-12 19:18:32
@_date: 2017-04-05 12:28:13
is that push? or poll?
@_date: 2017-04-20 14:42:46
ok. 
as for my initial question -- they're basically the same?
@_date: 2017-04-13 03:10:58
I'll need to connect to my server with bitcoin core running on it via a python script from other computer and call rpc procedures. will your solution still work?
@_date: 2017-04-10 01:13:33
my initial  question is: how can  it be achived without that pull request that's been pointed out above?
@_date: 2017-04-13 14:05:31
@_date: 2017-04-20 14:23:56


what's that?
@_date: 2017-04-10 01:15:02




of course, not. because there's always a pool of normal addresses, isn't there? I won't use them, but normal address get created with a wallet automatically anyway. hence, will "getreceivedbyaddress" still work?
@_date: 2017-04-08 12:55:44
I don't use electrum

re-read my question
@_date: 2017-04-13 07:57:07
yellow bus
@_date: 2017-04-08 08:49:33
in that case, how will I be able to request a subsequent, unused watch-only address from the core?
@_date: 2017-04-09 16:03:26
since it's not merged yet, how can I do that now?
@_date: 2017-04-05 18:41:18




why? a new block is created every 10 minutes. is there a need to poll every few seconds?
@_date: 2017-04-13 13:59:14
ok. 
will the bitcoin core be able to tell any difference wether it's being called via normal, unencrypted rpc or rpc tunneled via ssh? namely, in the bicoin.conf there's "rpcallowip", will tunneling via ssh preserve the real ip address of a server from which I call bitcoin core rpc? 
in other words, will bitcoin core see the incoming rpc requests as normal/remote or local ones?
@_date: 2017-04-13 09:37:01
that's not from that link
@_date: 2017-04-08 05:16:58
will that be better? won't it slow down the core?
@_date: 2017-04-12 19:18:23
there's no answer there.
@_date: 2017-04-20 14:24:30
I don't get your point.
@_date: 2017-04-08 03:48:55
what does that have to do with my question?
@_date: 2017-04-09 03:48:26


then don't answer, what's the problem?
you don't understand my question.
@_date: 2017-04-10 01:16:49
@_date: 2017-04-13 03:11:41
are you an idiot?
@_date: 2017-04-06 12:51:31
@_date: 2017-04-08 20:08:56
that's just gibberish.
@_date: 2017-04-13 06:16:21
why? I can build my own rest api web application, that'll be it.

~/$USER/.bitcoin is the DATA DIRECTORY!
I asked where I **should** unzip the bitcoin source code.
@_date: 2017-05-10 08:14:12
where is recommended to unzip bitcoin sources to: in /opt or a home directory?
