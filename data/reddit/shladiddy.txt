Didn't  he bang girls in-between innings?  That fact alone should have made his cards sky rocket.

LEt's not celebrate until we see it hold this range for longer than 16 hours.   I admit, it is nice to see that bounce off of 9k, i honestly thought it was going to bottom out even further.    
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:28:28
10K-20k range went up way too fast and for really no good reason.  This doesn't surprise me at all(look at my old posts)
Let's hope it doesn't break below 10k.  But honestly, any additional negative ASIA news will make this go sub 10k so easily.  This week is going to be interesting.

Yup, they have a 4.7/5 rating on the app store.  Guess what exchange most people will use?
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:59:41
It is a royal pain in the ass getting setup with any exchange.  Most people won't ever get past the "security questions" portion of the sign up process.  
Daunting, clunky, inconsistent, and plain scary, are the words i'd use to describe crypto exchanges.  There's a reason Coinbase can pretty much act with impunity right now.

OH god, now i know BTC is in a downtrend.

Hah, you think 13k pricing is "blood in the streets"?    This shit is candy land right now.  
When it goes sub 10k and the drop that will follow.  That's "blood in the streets"

The Thiel story is old.  It's just now being made public.  The dude already made mega profit off of his investment.  If anything he's selling not investing right now.
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:08:19
Yes, let's not forget the time it went from 1K+ to 200 USD that lasted over a year.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:24:18
Exchanges are the only way to reliably buy/sell crypto.   The slow bleed out in pricing and the big one from today is all tied to this very fact.  
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:21:02
 He's the Guy Fieri of investments.   I don't see anyone under the age of 80 years old even listening to what he has to say.  
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:54:23
Really wish he'd change his profile pic.  Just makes me instantly angry.   I just imagine him saying everything with that shit eating grin while standing in front of a private plane.  
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:36:45
Note that the drop from 17k back to 14k is mostly tied to issues with pricing on the korean exchanges.  
Honestly i'm surprised it's still floating around the 14-15k price.  Unless something really substantial happens (lightning/transaction fee issue) i only see pricing slowly going back down.  I predict it will touch 10k which will prompt a drop to 8-9k.  
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:00:35
They cut off the rest of the video where you just see a pair of detached limbs floating in the water.  
"Dakwon!  It's okay, they just severed limbs.  You need to quit being a baby!!!"
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:49:42
Yeah seeing it float around 14-15k is like watching a tap dancer doing a routine on some thin ice.   
The thiel news isn't enough to keep it propped up.   I'd love for it to trade sideways at this level for a while but i'm extremely doubtful.  Hope to be wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:40:08
He looks like Hannibal Lector wearing a skin mask of James Woods.   
If anything he'll scare the price of BTC up.
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:39:38
It was interesting how the korea FUD hit right as BTC started gaining some traction, also on the BCH side price jumped almost 30% the same day before being erased by the FUD machine.
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:38:40
TL;DR translation 
(I grew crypto, .6 something, don't buy from coinable, 19k and dropped 4k)
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:29:46
Lunar New Year?  Really? 
 Asians are leaving the market in droves.  They've had enough.  Not that they don't believe in BTC or whatever crypto, they are scared the government will lock down exchanges and they'd be cut off from their money.  
It's only going to take one more Asian Fun piece to tank the price below 10k.   
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:33:43
Governments putting the squeeze on exchanges since they know that's really the only means that people have to reliably purchase/sell them.   Asians are extremely fearful their money will be taken, hence the mass exodus.  Will be awhile for them to come back.  I see price going sub 10k very soon. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:38:50
Yup, 10-20k was pure hype. Now that 10k was broken, i definitely see a fall back to 5k.  
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:38:35
You know it's serious when you start having dreams of price action on the GDAX.   
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:35:35
Also i tried sending about 10 bucks worth of BCH over to another wallet, and it's been pending for 2 hours now.  Thought it was supposed to be lightning fast?   Bunch of horse shit. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:50:56
The laws of reddit state
If you transfer more than 10k you will have your money taken away by gubment.
Don't ever cash crypto to FIAT because capital gains tax is 150% apparently.
IF you use coinbase you won't be able to deposit money into your bank account ever.
If you use a cold storage wallet chances are it was hacked by a previous owner and you will lose your cryptos
Not matter what you do, you will lose all your crypto to a hacker eventually.

The guy in the poster is thinking "I've maxed out all my cards to buy crypto. I feel numb."
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:43:34
The whole bit about his fear of the price tanking and owing more in debt than what his donations were worth are pretty sobering.   Always, always keep things in perspective.  
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:24:05
I'm sure all the new "investors" who bought in the 15-20k range are withering away from all this horse shit.  I don't fault them for throwing in the towel.   Definitely see a downtrend to 10k pricing soon.    
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:30:23

Simple breakdown
BTC:   15k-19k investors are all jumping ship.
BCH:  3k-4k investors are all jumping ship.
Many more waiting on sidelines sweating bullets that will also jump ship when it drops further.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:28:13
Well, we are here floating dangerously at 12k.  I hope it doesn't go back down to 5k but the way things are going it won't surprise me at all.  
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:24:09
Do you recall those videos of party goers dancing on a platform only to have the whole thing collapse?  That's what the 18-19k price is.    The price has been overextended since it hit 10k.  Just watch.  We will be back in the 12s very soon, and once that happens all the "HODLers" will scatter like roaches dropping it another 5k.  We will then float around 1.5-2k price for 6 months to a year until something major happens.  Mark this post.  
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:18:57
He must be getting tired since we are now flirting with sub 18k prices. Maybe he's facing the wrong direction?

What a cluster fuck
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:22:52
BTC has now fallen below 17k, which means we'll be seeing 16k real soon, at which point all the new investors will abandon ship dropping it back to 10-12.  I don't want to be right.  I really don't.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:59:21
That big shiny coconut headed m'fer is to blame.

When you look at the price and say "F*&amp;%, what happened!?? it's going to zero!!!"
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:26:46
Well we are here now.  Crashed to 11k.   Hopefully my prediction of going back down to 5k won't happen.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:24:28
You guys talk about taxes as though you'll lose 95% or more of your profits.   At worst you are paying 40%.   
Using this sub reddit's logic, if you sold BTC for a gain of 10K you'd be taxed 15k by the government.   Why bother even investing in anything?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:31:07
Yup i thought 12 hours was long. Now we are going into 24+hr territory.  Fun times.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:27:12
I hope so, but i think we've all been spoiled at how quickly BTC price sky rocketed in just one month. There's a lot of new money coming in with the patience of a 2 year old hoping they can double/triple money by new year.   Real meaningful things take time and i just have to give the side eye to any drastic price behavior happening every few hours/days.  It's just not healthy in the long term.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:35:16
Stay away from memory foam, especially the ikea memory foam!  That "contours to your body" selling point is complete crap. They are hot and uncomfortable.   
Any mattress that costs less than 1k is honestly pretty terrible.  Trust me i've slept on those same ikea mattresses most of my young life and had no idea what i was missing out on when i got my first 3k mattress.  It was like going from sleeping on a pile of rocks to an Angel's sweet bosom.

Some more "old man" advice
1. Buy a dedicated porn laptop,  that way you don't have to worry about clearing out your history anymore.  
2. Prioritize buying a really comfortable mattress.  Not that ikea shit.  
3. Stop eating processed meats.  will give you butthole cancer and you can't enjoy your bitcoin money.

@_date: 2017-12-18 18:17:36
The rug is going to get pulled out from under this thing, and we will be back at around 2-3k.   That's my prediction.  We are all partying on a shaky bridge with that one last rivet holding it all together.  May hold for a few weeks, maybe a month.  But that rivet will snap and all the new investors will plummet into the abyss.

Look, i was ecstatic with the 10k price.   Having it "crash" back to 10k means nothing to the real "HODL" out there.  Mania/hype train is the only reason it blew up to 19k.  Again, true "hodlers" realized that and took some sweet profits off the table.
