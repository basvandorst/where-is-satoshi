I disagree with the OP only because I see digital currency as multi-purpose. I wouldn't say Bitcoin is the "standard" of any sort, but rather a type of digital currency that is leading the charge. People buy into digital currency for different reasons, right now most of which is going into Bitcoin because users like the idea of building wealth in an ever popular item. 
The problem Bitcoin encountered early on was merchant adoption. In other words, people were interested in the currency but no merchant wanted to redeem it, and thus created this artificial bubble that kept buyers and sells isolated. The same similar scenario will happen to most other digital currencies, and is currently an issue for Litecoin. 
However, we see this issue as an opportunity to spread the idea of merchants accepting alternative methods of currency as the benefits of processing it outweighs much of the negativity of traditional processors. 
I originally posted yesterday on the Litecoin forum, with my intention to develop an Mobile Wallet based system for Litecoin but also more of a general purpose application that allows users to easily transact their digital currency with Live Merchants. We are a team of 4, and will be releasing the platform completely free to use early next year. 
I would ask the Bitcoin community to not be so hard and arrogant about other currencies as they are currently in the shoes that bitcoin once wore less than 2 years ago. In my eyes, if we can convince merchants around the world to accept multiple methods of digital currencies, than we will have successfully validated the existence and usage of alternative methods of currency.
