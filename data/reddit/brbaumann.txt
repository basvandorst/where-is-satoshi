If you convert on gdax for much lower fees (0 fee if you make your own limit order), then transfer the btc back to coinbase.

You could sign up for a free shift card with coinbase and spend that money via debit transactions.

I’ve been in btc since 2013 and even I’ll admit I got caught up in a bit of the altcoin craze of 2017. Greed got the best of me and now I have less btc than when I started. Lesson learned the hard way.

Yes because the switch happens as you paste the address on your computer before signing it with the Trezor. And unless you spot the difference right away, it will appear legit because the address displayed on your Trezor device will match what was pasted in the web wallet interface. 
I wouldn't say this is a fault of the Trezor, just make sure you read the first few digits in your head and make sure it's the same after you paste.

I'm curious how someone would lose coins from a paper wallet. All it is, is a private key printed on paper. When I moved all my coins from paper wallets to a trezor, all I did was import the private keys into electrum and send the coins to trezor, like I would with a non paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:28:56
That's not what I'm saying. Op implied using mBTC would somehow cause him to send the wrong amount. Anyone who would make that mistake would make the same mistake with BTC.

It's the standard version of bitcoin. Not BU, and the people who want segwit.

But if everyone is using segwit then everyone gets the lower fees. I don't see the issue.
Also, wouldn't cheaper transaction fees + more transactions pretty much equal out?

So you only got into bitcoin to make money. You never did any research and didn’t believe in what bitcoin represents. 
Now you lost money, and are all of a sudden an expert on the topic? You never should have gotten into crypto in the first place. The fact you see bitcoin as dying because the price has dropped shows you clearly still don’t get it.

It was both. Busted being logged into the admin page. Framed for murder-for-hire. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 15:39:51
You can say that about any amount of money. What’s your point?
@_date: 2018-12-18 15:07:51
You had the option same time as OP did. 
@_date: 2018-12-22 16:07:14
Monero is good though

Homie, I’ve been in the game for over 5 years. This is not what dying looks like. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 17:34:57
Sounds like you bought at the top. That’s what happens when greed takes over.

Buying bitcoin was the smartest thing I’ve ever done financially. Seems the only people who got burned, were the ones trying to make a quick buck during the rise in price.

You are picking and choosing. Some alts go up twice as much as btc, most don’t. On average, you are better off sticking with bitcoin.

Apt analysis, Robert.

Tell that to anyone who bought before 2017. Every single person who bought and held is up greatly. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 14:25:45
That’s a pretty big detail to leave out of your original complaint. Would you rather it be easy to reset 2FA and make it completely useless?
@_date: 2018-12-23 21:25:59
Sounds like you don’t get the point of bitcoin. If you feel like a fool for buying, then you are probably right. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 02:40:41
That just says you bought during the hype. Right now is a great time to buy compared to 2017. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 16:50:18
No more than those “where’s George” stamps.

Remember when this happened to Wikileaks? They made money hand over fist when they were forced to use bitcoin.

One small correction. He actually did sell mushrooms on the Silk Road. He was the first vendor on the site. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 14:13:33
100% projecting. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 19:11:04
Yeah I do agree with you about that part
