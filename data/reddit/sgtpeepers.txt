he's with both zillow and tripadvisor:
"Spencer Rascoff is the Chief Executive Officer and a Director of Zillow Inc. " [source]( 
"... Spencer Rascoff, [...] elected to TripAdvisor's board of directors."  [source](
also Hotwire :  "In 1999, Spencer co-founded Hotwire"
also Wallstreet!  "Before his consumer Web career, Spencer was a private equity investor at TPG Capital, and an investment banker at Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns and Allen &amp; Company."
A good guy to know :)

Servers would be online, that's not very cold.
You have to go out of your way to get a desktop with ECC RAM. Like you did, have to go Xeon, you are very limited with what motherboards you can pick (prob. supermicro), built it yourself. I think it is unlikely Mark did this. This is the guy who wrote a SSH sever in PHP and hinted he'd use it in production?

yay racism!
next time I'll only trust an eskimo, I know they're good at cold storage *ba ding ding*

the beauty of bitcoin: it could be anything / anyone. no real way to know.
totaly public and open yet still pretty anonymous 
@_date: 2014-03-09 09:33:48
I thought this was an interesting theory: 
"He would know Gavin Andresen personally through that group"
the phrase "Right, exactly." appears on google only 264,000 times.
At this point, I highly doubt anyone will discover who Satoshi is from googling, people have been doing that for 5 years with no luck.
But I don't think it does any harm, it's fun and adds to the mystery of bitcoin, it gives it mainstream appeal &amp; a cool backstory that will draw people in to learn more.

Not unless he sold them, and I don't expect he ever will.
There are "alt coins" like PPC which have the "proof of stake" concept, that pays interest to people who hold the coins, but Bitcoin does not work that way.
@_date: 2014-02-22 09:18:22
As I understand it, someone double spent a large sum of "XCP" on an exchange, then sold it all for 80 BTC, then withdrew. So the rollback does not help get the BTC back sadly.
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:56:30
Wow, thanks for telling me! I would never have known.
Strangely they botched it pretty bad : "This is the beauty of the beauty ...?"
Also, my comment has 0 points :)
Hehe. Thanks.

where did you find this?
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:15:58
Ok, send me 50 BTC from an early block and we'll believe you!
I'm 1K2tCraptUoAgykBCQ3SZfQD9AiVd15Scu
edit: I'll send it back (and then eat a hat)
@_date: 2014-03-09 09:04:50


I think that's a different (younger) Wei Dai
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:45:37
As I understood it, he always used TOR. Even to submit blocks (from day 1).
I am curious about how he registered bitcoin.org , how he paid for it anonymously
@_date: 2014-03-10 03:21:49
Oh, wow, he even bought a video card to mine. Neat.
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:38:18
Hey, they lost it all, apparently! That *is* fucking dumb.
@_date: 2014-02-22 07:19:16
At least they haven't taken anyone's money, yet. It looks like they are testing it for bugs before selling "ethers".
Now look at "Counterparty" aka XCP, another recent "next big thing" alt-coin.  Instead of testing it first, they released a buggy alpha version, and surprise surprise - a few days ago a "hacker" found a way to double spend "XCP" to the tune of 80 BTC from the users.
Supposedly the "hacker" is going to give back the 80 BTC once the flaws he's found are fixed - but the developers are giving very little information.
If you are curious for details [here is someone's post explaining the mess they're in](
I think the moral of the story: if the source code is not based on bitcoin, be very careful investing your money. Bitcoin has been examined for bugs by the best "hackers" in the world and is still standing, a testament to Satoshi's work and the rest of the developers. All these other coins - Ethereum, Mastercoin, Counterparty, etc? Not even in the same league.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:45:26
yes, if you got 100% of bitcoiners to agree to it (i.e. no)
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:06:29
you'd have to trust the guy who lost it all in the first place (mark) to give you an accurate database of who's owed what, for all we know he's got a friend in there, he could just say Friend = 20,000 BTC and we'd never know. all trust is lost with Gox
@_date: 2014-02-22 07:51:35
Downvoted because you are putting words in my mouth, I never said "test it then claim it's good and done"
Before you ask everyone to buy mastercoins, or burn counterparty, or whatever, there should be code that can be tested, like bitcoin has (testnet), to look for basic bugs like the one counterparty had.
Read up on the history of Bitcoin, how dan kaminsky was amazed how bitcoin had clearly been tested before release - every bug he thought of had already been fixed!
["Computer Security researcher Dan Kaminsky tried to hack Bitcoin and failed"](
Bitcoin was tested before release, counterparty was not.
And Ethereum will have the same fate unless they do a lot more testing...

Long-term: the majority of money in bitcoin vanishes overnight. Half a billion lost, they certainly aren't going to reinvest any time soon. Lots of people drop out of the community because they lost a huge sum of money and it has left a bad taste in their mouth.

This + Neo/Bee... something tells me America is getting left behind.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:28:34
that's what people said about the PRISIM leaks when they first happened - "that powerpoint looks so unprofessional" 
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:04:03
But what about all the fun it has created?
@_date: 2014-02-24 08:36:34
Sorry, I keep seeing things about this - what is it?
@_date: 2014-03-09 09:03:38
has Wei Dai ever made a public comment about Bitcoin (what he thinks of it, etc)?
@_date: 2014-02-24 08:47:10
Every time a new version is released I cringe. Yes, I do want new features, but there is a chance of a bug being introduced (like the mini-fork in early 2013) that could destroy everything. So, part of me is glad they are not doing much.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:52:19
My guess... certain kinds of ... jobs... exchanging work for jobs? :P
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:35:02
so fake
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:39:22
cold storage = never plugged into a network, not even once. So what would this server ever serve?
I'm glad you found a cheap 6 year old desktop that uses ECC. Is your point that it is also very likely Mark has ECC on his desktops? I don't understand. I think it is fair to say it is less likely, not more likely. You have to look for it, the average Dell/HP/whatever business offering does not have ECC, isn't that a fair statement?
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:53:16
just doin' your job, I guess, but way to harass an old dude who recently had a stroke :(
@_date: 2014-02-22 07:58:21
That is very fair, but making the timeframe 1 month only, makes it much less fair.
It's the same as doing "TAG, YOU'RE IT" and running away. The devs, and a handful of devout alt coin fanatics get the entire economy in the first 4 weeks. No reason they could not have made it 6 months.
@_date: 2014-03-04 08:38:05
This is the 2nd time poloniex was hacked. Strangely though, the first time, the hacker gave back the 115 BTC stolen!
To be fair that was more of an exploit of a coin, but it was still dumb of poloniex too, since he allowed the huge amount of BTC to be withdrawn without any safeguards.
If you look at the owner's posting history there are some whoppers in there that make you think he might not fully understand what he is doing (not knowing how change addresses work, not knowing what signing a message means, etc). I think he's legit and I hope he pays someone to audit his code or this will keep happening. It's hard to run an exchange. I think ALL of them have been hacked. (not counting mcxnow since that is shadytown to begin with)
@_date: 2014-02-21 05:49:16
Hello Mike,
A loooong time ago you posted a contest for people to beta test your site, look for security bugs etc. I wrote you about a minor thing, probably not worth anything, but you wrote back weeks later that I'd won!
But then I never heard anything again. A few months passed and I wrote again, and you said you'd send in in a few days, but I never got anything or heard back from you.
I am sort of embarrassed posting this, I don't even remember what I wrote you in the first place, and it was probably not worth anything. But my address is 1Q7zqcnKTR9NHA1pSmuRnB42zBGadJps6z
if you still are doing that. Thanks :&gt;
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:41:07
we're also culling the majority of btc investors by that logic. mtgox was billed by most as the top exchange, lots of people didn't set up a wallet program, kept it in there... lots of people got fucked and they aren't going to reinvest half a billion soon
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:54:40
I would have lawyer'd up before releasing this
@_date: 2014-02-24 08:40:32
Is that a joke? Why do you say that?
@_date: 2014-02-22 08:44:50




Because it lost at least $45,200 USD? Nobody lost money in your example.
@_date: 2014-02-22 07:41:59
How is a "one month window in january" a fair launch. That's like if Satoshi had set all 21 million coins to be released in January 2009. And of course, he and his friends would get most of them, because 1 month is not even close enough time to get the word out.
Anyway my point was : release a version that people can test for a few months, collect a bounty to have a code review done, before you get everyone setting fire to their bitcoins and get bit by simple bugs.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:31:34
nothing disappeared
if anything it was stolen by people - they have it now. but we don't know if it was stolen or not, just rumors
nothing to do with mining
coins never disappear, but they can become inaccessible if you lost the key.
