I am aware of it, but it is not something really available in the Uk and I have not got the funds to travel.

I am aware of both the benefits and negatives that come with other psychoactive substances. Believe me, I have spent an incredible amount of time researching all options for PTSD because again, it fucking sucks. 
I have done mushrooms and other substances and they do provide benefits to a point. However the most important part of the MDMA     therapies is that they build trust and provide opportunities to work through lifelong trauma with psychotherapy as well. Fear is definitely a huge problem for me, but instead of just reducing that bit, I will need to dig deeper and finding some meaning or peace with what I have been through. MDMA helps facilitate that.
I don't know though, at this point I'm desperate. The research for these trials is outstanding. So at the moment I am clinging onto the hope these trails provide.

I have tried EMDR and it was beneficial up to a point. It definitely helped with a particular nightmare I was having but unfortunately the sessions were not long enough to address the emotional context as well. Six weeks really isn't enough time to cover trauma well, and a lot of the therapies in the UK are organised over a 6 week period.
I am waiting for long term psychotherapy at the moment, but again, I could be waiting years as the NHS is fucked currently, the MH structure is not fit for purpose, and I am considered functional...

I have post traumatic stress disorder. I live in the uk and it is likely this treatment will only be available in 2021. I am pushing myself to wait that long but I am unsure if I will be able to.
I would not wish this mental illness on my worst enemy. Nights and days are full of flashbacks  of rape, social exclusion, betrayal...I am constantly paranoid and at times I don't even trust my best friends who have been through so much with me. I beg of you, if you have any money to spare, please consider helping this study out...I, like so many others, just want to live a normal life and not feel so terrified all the time.
