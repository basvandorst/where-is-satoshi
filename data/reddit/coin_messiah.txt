1. Mark will frame his own death and live his life in luxury.
2. He will get killed.
3. No harm will be done to him.
4. He will get tortured to get some Bitcoins off him by people who have there lives at stake or mafia.
5. He is a tool for MtGox's actual founders, like Barney Stinsons' job from the TV Show How i met your mother. "Barney's job is to "Provide Legal Exculpation And Sign Everything" (P.L.E.A.S.E.), setting him up to be the fall guy for his company's nefarious activities.", he could also be killed later by the company. 
Whatever it is, theories are endless.

For a company declaring bankruptcy, this shouldn't become an issue.

What i mean by nullifying is create a fork of bitcoin by working together with pools and developers, this affects a large portion of the current coins in circulations and if the coins in circulation.
*If the private keys where lost* and mtgox can provide some evidence to backup claims that the wallets where the ones in cold storage, they can get the coins moved to another wallet.
*If the coins where stolen*, There is a possibility that all *750,000* coins haven't been moved about yet into exchanges, and if they have, they could communicate with exchanges to try locate where they sit. 
If anything even if 10% of the coins are still sitting in the wallets the thieves withdrew coins to, there is a possibility to recover them.
Point is, the longer they take there time in both event's, less likely it will be to recover the coins.
