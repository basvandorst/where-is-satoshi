Email support with a copy of the transaction ID on blockchain and they will issue you a refund. What likely happened is the ramen shop did not refresh the payment page (a tiny circle of arrows on the top left of the screen that shows the QR code).

Just a warning, the codebase for the Cydia Blockchain app, just like the one that was in the app store, has a hard-coded transaction fee of 0.0005btc, which is around 40 cents right now. That adds up quick.
Instead, just use a QR code scanning app and load Blockchain's wallet in Safari. You can customize the transaction fee, and all features work fine. Scan QR codes using the scanner app, then copy and paste wallet addresses into safari. Yes, it's clunky, and a real app that has an updated transaction fee would be much better, but doesn't exist.

Q: Do you have a date for the movie premier?
A: We don't because we are going to submit it to some film festivals to try to get the maximum impact. Our goal is to have the widest release possible so that we can reach as many eyeballs as possible. The film festivals have rules about distribution of the film prior to festival dates. We also are exploring distribution deals with at least four different entertainment industry players. This is a new process for us, and we are learning that in order to get the widest possible release, you have to play the game.

1) Buyer pays 5% deposit for the TV, and in person, sends the remaining payment. That way you know the person standing in front of you controls the same private key. If the full amount was first transferred before meeting, just have the same buyer send a few cents using the same address, to verify they own the key to the same address that sent the full payment.
2) Use a payment integration service like bitpay.com, to collect the shopping cart address data, email address, and link it with a payment. The funds are transferred instantly to an address you control the keys for.

tl;dr - Fairly balanced article. Also:
 - You can buy a car with bitcoin at 
 - You can buy cupcakes with bitcoin at 
By ROBIN SIDEL
Norman Vialle, a 53-year-old car dealer in Kansas, invested in his share of winners and losers during the Internet bubble of the 1990s. Now he is clinging to a stash of Bitcoin, even though the fledgling virtual currency has lost about 70% of its value in the past week.
"It's volatile because it's new, but it's still a lot higher than it was a month ago," Mr. Vialle says.
In addition to investing in the currency, Mr. Vialle recently began accepting bitcoins for payment at Overland Park Jeep Dodge Ram Chrysler. One of his customers is planning to pay for a $40,000 Jeep with the currency next month.
It has been a volatile month for Bitcoin, the virtual currency that is based on a mathematic algorithm and can be used to buy everything from maple syrup to pornography.
A furious run-up in the value of Bitcoin earlier this month has been followed by an abrupt price drop that has rattled investors. The price of one Bitcoin unit continued its dive on Tuesday, falling 39% at one point to $50 before recovering somewhat to around $70.
The unpredictable trading has given fresh fuel to skeptics, who question the viability of a volatile currency that isn't backed by a central bank.
"I think there are some businesses that offer legitimate goods that like the concept and like the cachet of it," said Beth Robertson, a senior consultant with Javelin Strategy and Research, which focuses on the payments industry. "But I don't think that you're going to see any broad base of merchants accepting Bitcoin."
Regulators, meanwhile, recently weighed in on virtual currencies for the first time, encouraging entities that exchange or sell them to follow the same money-laundering rules that apply to companies like Western Union Co. WU +1.15%
Despite the lack of wide acceptance and looming prospect for regulation, a cadre of Silicon Valley venture capitalists, Web programmers and anti-Establishment thinkers are still revved up about Bitcoin's prospects.
Unlike currencies that are backed by a central bank, Bitcoin users can essentially create the units themselves in a process called "mining" that involves solving a complicated mathematical problem with sophisticated computer servers.
The currency, which is stored in an online account, also can be traded on an exchange and swapped privately.
Bitcoin payments are becoming increasingly popular among Internet merchants, who want to reduce costs associated with accepting credit cards.
The virtual currency also is starting to make inroads in the brick-and-mortar world, where customers can pay with bitcoins using their mobile phones.
But because the transactions are essentially anonymous, critics worry that the currency could be used for drug trafficking and money laundering.
The U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, known as FinCen, last month issued a three-page memo that effectively lays the groundwork to regulate firms that issue or exchange virtual currencies. Among other things, money transmitters must alert authorities if they believe a transaction might be tied to suspicious activity.
Despite the looming regulation, investors were encouraged by the memo. They believe increased oversight will ease money-laundering concerns that have kept some investors and merchants out of the market.
"The industry is happy about this guidance even if it imposes a regulatory burden because it is an indicator of respectability," says Behnam Dayanim, a lawyer at Paul Hastings LLP in Washington.
The memo helped spark a rally earlier this month on the Tokyo-based Mt. Gox exchange, which says that it handles 80% of Bitcoin trading. The currency nearly quintupled in less than a month, leaping from roughly $50 in mid-March to a high of $230 on April 9.
But since then, Bitcoin has plunged almost as quickly as it rose. Mt. Gox suspended trading for 12 hours last week after a surge in trading volume overloaded its system. The exchange also has been hit with cyberattacks. Such wild swings could make it difficult for the virtual currency to gain traction—among investors and businesses alike, experts said.
But Jennifer Longson, who began accepting bitcoins at her San Francisco cupcake bakery in October, considers the volatility to be no different from the fluctuations she sees in the price of her baking ingredients. Customers use Bitcoin for payment three or four times a week at her store, she said. "They're all excited to talk about it," said the owner of Cups and Cakes Bakery, whose concoctions include cupcakes made with ingredients such as bacon and tequila.
Ms. Longson's husband, Tom, has been buying and selling the currency for the past year. He cashed out his original investment when the price hit $100 in early April, but bought some for $241 last week.
"I lost some money, but not enough to jump off a building. Unfortunately, I sold some to a friend at that price as well and I felt guilty about that," he said.
The price gyrations are more worrisome to John Reitano, co-founder of three-month-old CoinFlash, a San Diego company that aims to launch a bitcoin-trading network that is similar to airport currency kiosks this summer. "Our hope is that the volatility settles down over time," said Mr. Reitano, who already is preparing to answer investor questions about the issue.
Entrepreneurs hope the new FinCen guidelines will help Bitcoin evolve into a more developed currency. A number of companies are expected to register with FinCen as money transmitters in the coming months. A few already have done so, anticipating that the industry would be capturing the attention of regulators.
But Mr. Vialle, the car dealer, still views Bitcoin more as an investing opportunity than a payment mechanism. He says he plans to hang onto his bitcoins, which he mined about a year ago, for the foreseeable future. "Maybe I will use them someday, but I probably will hold them for five or 10 years," he says.

Just make sure you run the calculations - you also throw some money away on a mortgage (Broker fees, inspection fees, INTEREST on the mortgage, property taxes, etc).

I'm listed on localbitcoins.com and have given an hour of my time to teach someone about Bitcoin, but they had to sign up on the site and ask to buy some from me first.
There are local meetup's about bitcoin.
But maybe what we can start is soft of an "explain it like I'm five" series of open Webinars. Someone owns "learnbitcoin.com" but isn't doing anything with it. That way you can walk through folks that sign up (for $4 or something) and they get a) 30 minutes web coaching and walking through websites, software, mobile apps, the network, etc, and receive $1 back in bitcoin to start playing with sending BTC between wallets.

Hopefully they stick around and start communicating better. I'd be okay if they raised their fee if they had excellent support communication. Hell, I'd pay them for it.

There are several bugs but its a great start!
For those having issue with QR code scanner, use another QR app like QRReader to copy the address to clipboard.
- QR code when displayed lists btc even if USD was selected when sending receiving, and text is overlapping. 
- When sending, shows "null" in transaction list before updating with Pending. 
- Pin required for showing a receiving QR code. Why? Not necessary it's a public address.
- When sending a few millibits, got an Error pop up warning about a network fee with asking yes or no, but "Okay" was only button, no clear indication if the transaction was sent or not. (It was not). Second transaction for a few bit cents sent no questions asked and also charged a network fee. Show network fee up front in Send screen and allow it to be changed! 
Feature requests
- Cannot copy/paste addresses from previous transactions
- Address book with labels
- Referral link /send email directly from app!

They take forever to send. One transaction took 27 hours for me last week. No joke. 
So I don't keep ANY btc with them. And when I send I do in small batches.

I'll print flyers for you and mail them to you, you just need to design them and PM me a link to the PDF. Will do it for free, and pay me in bitcoins after you get your first few jobs started.

What kind of work do you contract with them, if you don't mind me asking? First I've heard of those sites, very interesting!

 still takes ACH far as I know - no fee but will still take a few days. You could do ACH-&gt;Dwolla-&gt;BitInstant for 2% fees and I think that's much faster, but you pay the fee for it. And a few days to ACH into Dwolla.

Yes, you can scan QR codes and send bitcoins! Looks like it interfaces with their web API so needs a live connection. Some bugs for sure but sent some btc and it worked.

I haven't seen any full fledged reviews, other than some mentions of people that bought tickets on twitter. Agree this is important to get some independent verification out there, but it may be a chicken and egg game at this point since it's a brand new service.

He posted free codes and a donation address, which you are free to completely ignore and get the app for free. It would be selling if he *required* a payment before sending you a code, but that's not what he did.
@_date: 2013-05-13 18:27:22
I'm not sure this is against TOS, because he's not "selling" the app, he is giving away promo codes, and accepting, but not requiring a donation. Technically, everyone could use a free code and send him nothing. I haven't read the TOS but it seems this is perfectly fine, since he is not requiring payment for a code.
