I hope Valve realises that it is possible to accept customer payments in Bitcoin and get it transferred into flat currency instantly.

I think its well known that in a single day, the amount of physical cash worldwide (in US$) that is used and or gained from nefarious means far far far outways the total amount of Bitcoin (in US$ amount) that has been used and or gained for nefarious means in its entire history.
**So for a US Senator (and sadly a Democrat) to write a letter to the US Treasury and Federal Reserve saying that Bitcoin is disruptive to the US economy and should be banned? Excuse me? Bitcoins current market cap is a tiny $14 billion.**
Now lets have a look at one of the nefarious means and its effects: **Drugs**
[HSBC alone laundered Billions in money for drug cartels.]( 
[From the UN 2012 Drug Report](
Page 60


opiates and cocaine is relatively well-studied. UNODC 
estimates suggest that the total retail market for cocaine 
amounts to some $85 billion and the opiate market 
amounts to some $68 billion (figures for 2009). The 
overall value of the illicit drug market was estimated at 
about $320 billion for the year 2003, equivalent to 0.9 per 
cent of global GDP*.

**Im guessing a large majority of us would agree that a significant % of drugs worldwide (im estimating 95%+) are purchased with cash.**
Now Regarding **Scam Artists**
Quoting Joe Manchin in his recent [letter to the US Treasury and The Federal Reserve](


According to this from 2009 [CNN Money Report](  Bernie Maddoffs Ponzie Scheme hit $65 Billion.
And from a 2011 [NPR Report]( 


P.S Apologies for the Wall of text.

Miners will be happy with the 40% power reduction and 65% speed improvement. This could become a lucrative niche for AMD. Go AMD go!

After working in a tech call centre for 6 months I truly feel sorry for the mtgox customer service representatives who are receiving these phone call inquires. It would be hell. I highly doubt Karpeles would be sitting behind a desk receiving calls and dealing with very angry customers.

I'm a very minimalistic/K.I.S.S designer and the Ƀ fits my style of design perfectly. It's exists in unicode already and can be reproduced in pretty much any type family.
