Check out and - a bot that condenses the threads at and a few other places.  We could see if they want to keep an eye on our subreddit too although we don't have a whole lot of AMAs here.
EDIT: Better yet, check this out:

Weird.  I've made 3 purchases with Coinbase already and I've not had any issues but I've been seeing a wealth of complaints here and on the bitcointalk forums.  Once you do get through to them, they will honor the original purchase price apparently.
There are the couple of services that you can Western Union/Moneygram to to get the moneys with a quickness.  Bitinstant and the other one I can't remember.  
**well fuck me, bitinstant is down.  The other site i was thinking of was  but you might vett them out first.  I think they're pretty new.

You did a great motherfucking job you goddamn dirty dicklicker.

Wired is in on the scam!  This goes all the way to the top!

I was waiting for this! Great news Micon!

You've got a typo on there, my good man:
"4. Come back to our site and order from the menu. (DO NOT PLACE YOUR ORDER ON THE PIZZA HUT SITE AS YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TRANSFER THAT ORDER TO OURS. "
I figure you want it to read 'DO NOT PLACE YOUR ORDER ON THE PAPA JOHNS SITE.'
Somebody would be really screwed trying to order Papa Johns from Pizza Hut ;)
Awesome service, keep up the good work!

I've not used them personally, but looking through the archives the community seems to find them legit.  I've been happy with my couple of purchases through Coinbase, although it is slow as all hell.

Mining doesn't require any significant network throughput - it's all hardware that makes a difference.

Great, there goes all my bitcoin.

Drat, you we're quicker than I.

I actively monitor my credit report and I've not seen any activity since I signed up with Coinbase.  I think this may be uninformed nonsense.  They didn't take a whole lot of info, especially not a SSN.  They would not be able to effectively run a credit report without this.

Two monkeys are in a bathtub.  One monkey says "OOOH EEE EEE OOOOH EEE."  The other monkey says "If its too hot, run some cold water!"

I understand that playboy.  It's nice that it's cheap, it stinks that everything is so slow.  Hopefully once they get some more staff on things will operate more consistently.

Goddammit I was going to try to be first! I was too slow...

Are you using blockchain to host your wallet?  I know when I create new addresses or make any material changes to my wallet, it automatically creates a new backup.  I'm using Dropbox for my backups rather than email, but I know they've got the backup via email option there.

Good job guys!

Me?  I'm just kicking back and lurking.

Sure, whatever.

I had this same question when I looked at Bitinstant, but instead of asking for help I just got scared and closed the window.
I would like to know as well.

Another vouch for SwC, I play there everyday. Good community, and the android app is pimpin'. Standalone desktop apps coming soon!

Head over to bitmit.net and list them there.
