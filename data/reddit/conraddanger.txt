No point re-inventing the wheel, install wordpress, create some categories, create a page for submissions, post a few of the best submissions per day and link to their BTC address.  This should take about 20minutes and would look 100x better than the current page.  
I have a couple songs on soundcloud and a bitcoin wallet, but I don't think I would be inclined to submit anything until I saw the quality of other submissions.  Is this site for un-signed amateurs like myself?

Maybe make a little display case and download the CSV files about what blocks you mined on etc.  They are antiques now after all.

You still need a bank though, unless you want to bury your bitcoin and make a pirate map. We still need safe places to store things.
That has not changed.
@_date: 2015-07-02 07:38:52
Buy a small amount, play around with it, create 2 wallets, send some bitcoin back and forth.  Get your head around it.  Then you will have a better understanding of what you should do.

So you can send shares to someone without converting back to bitcoin?  So like this blue bitcoin represents 1000 shares of Xcompany.
Is this correct?
@_date: 2013-11-11 08:16:45
That would be a fun app.

Bitcoin is easier and faster to set up than paypal or debit cards.  In fact you need a debit card to use paypal, so you need to set up 2 accounts.

You might be getting a bit too excited there.

These problems can not be addressed with debit cards or cash.  There are probably more.
