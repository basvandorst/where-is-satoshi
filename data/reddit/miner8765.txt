The network is hurting itself. Path of least resistance and all that jazz

Fuck you voorhees. You personally have done a great deal of harm to btc

I used to mine the three largest pools, but got tired of fees  learned about eligius' operator, and started to enjoy my extra ixc and dvc
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:55:46
You are misinformed.
@_date: 2014-06-13 20:18:58
People justify a lot of shit in the name of faith. Like the crusades or suicide bombing. I prefer to associate with rationally minded folk. Lukejr publicly said that non Catholics were heretics. Do you know what a heretic is to a Catholic?

I don't have the patience to explain again. You can read my comment history

Wrong. Because difficulty is increasing
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:00:54
Mining will always be profitable for someone... Difficulty adjusts

I'm sorry, but you're wrong. profitability is determined by variance/luck per difficulty window. While difficulty is increasing, low variance/neutral luck is most profitable. IF difficulty were a constant then I'd be mining solo

Do you think people would mine if it wasnt profitable?
@_date: 2014-06-13 20:02:56
It matters to him. He's referred to people as heretics. Belief is a dangerous thing
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:02:38
In this case, luck is a technical term. If a block is found earlier than statistically expected then it's good "luck", later is bad luck. Larger polls find more blocks so "luck" averages closer to neutral, which is desirable. And there are no fees for miners using automatic withdrawals, you can check for yourself

Only if difficulty is constant (or the timeframe is infinite)
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:56:16
Duh. Did you think individual miners would *sacrifice* for the greater good?? A large farm costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, and even cheap electricity adds up. Lol. Were you expecting philanthropic miners? Hahahahah...hahaha

I dislike the fact the bfgminer is in use, but it is. Anyway, thank you for your constructive comments!

Lukejr is a well documented religious fanatic. Seriously

A butterfly labs employee just revealed the identity of one of the wealthiest bitcoiners. Butterfly labs is an asic manufacturer with a horrible reputation.

I'm not selling btc currently. I sold a bunch just before the gox crash. I have months worth of reserve cash for my operating costs
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:52:00
There is no withdrawal "tax" or fees. None.
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:08:18
Because the difficulty is increasing. Did you read my post? p2pool is too small right now
@_date: 2014-06-21 12:43:22
Goat is one of the wealthiest bitcoin users. He bought that  Lamborghini with btc last year...
