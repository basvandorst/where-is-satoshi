Dude, you're ridiculous. I have to register to access the whitepaper you claim proves your point.
Have a good day.

Hey I'm going to be nitpicky here because it's just us in this conversation.
Deflation in purchasing power is the same as saying price inflation, which is what Bitcoin is not.
Otherwise I'm happy we're on the same page and on this wonderful ride together.

Sorry, mind providing a list?

Everyone says they're planning on holding for a long time. But everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.
You have to genuinely ask yourself this: if your investment lost 90% of its value would you still hold?
And if the answer is no, that's ok. Just lower the amount and try again. You'll reach a number your comfortable with and that'll be your risk tolerance.
Now, as a general note, I'd say the longer one holds Bitcoin the larger their risk tolerance becomes. I believe this has to do with joining Bitcoin communities and getting exposure to its adoption, development, and other ongoings. So your risk tolerance may increase in the near future and at that point you could responsibly purchase more.

No thank you. If you make the claim, you should put in the effort.

So much negativity in here.
Futures are proven to be valuable to the development of industries. Why would Bitcoin be different?
Or is any news that isn't "Bitcoin Moon" bad news?
Here's a good link to help understand futures, if you're interested:

Technically, there's nothing wrong with your argument. But I'm not sure why you would present this argument the way you did.
People care about inflation, which is the sum of supply and demand forces. Over the past ten years it is abundantly clear that the sum of those forces has caused Bitcoin to be deflationary i.e. one Bitcoin has more purchasing power now than it did years ago.
Adoption is the primary force that is causing Bitcoin deflation. The sum of the inflationary forces (e.g. supply inflation) do not compare. And Bitcoin adoption is not slowing down; with the upcoming halving the inflationary forces will be lessened still.
If the current trends continue, and I'm hard pressed to see why they wouldn't, Bitcoin will continue to be deflationary as adoption continues. And as adoption slows down, the halving nature will likely continue keeping Bitcoin deflationary.

You assume a heavy demand for opening channels; how heavy is your assumption?
Let's use 2500 transactions per block as a conservative average. I just checked the blockchain and this is very reasonable.
There are 144 blocks mined in an average day. 144 = (60 minutes/10 minutes per block)*24 hours
That means in a year there are 131,400,000 transactions. 131,400,000 = 2500 * 144 * 365
Let's conservatively say 3/4 of those transactions are lightning network set ups. I'm choosing 3/4 as a conservative number because when lightning becomes the every day way to send Bitcoin, non-lightning transactions on the blockchain will likely be reduced to moving very large sums of value.
That means, in a year, ~100,000,000 new users will be onboarding onto the lightning network.
If the lightning network gets 100,000,000 new users every year I'd say things are going alright.

Your words convey that you don't truly understand how lightning will work.

I love Bitcoin. But it's anyone's guess exactly how it will play out if miners and the rest of the economic nodes split. A safe assumption would be that it would be bad for everyone as the value of Bitcoin is based largely off both its security and its adoption.
Let's hope we never have to cross that bridge. But I do like that neither party has significantly more negotiating power than the other, as a balance of power is usually better in economics.

That's a ridiculous argument. What about diversifying your portfolio to manage your risk tolerance?
None of that conventional investor knowledge I guess. Throw it right out the window.

No one person creates Bitcoin.
The community, by consensus, agrees that a miner should be awarded Bitcoin when they solve the next block.

What you've written is confusing. So I'll just say this:
If Bitcoin grows the way we all hope it does, and Bitcoin remains a risky investment, anyone who doesn't sell part of their investment as the price increases will be significantly increasing their exposure to risk. This is because Bitcoin, a risky asset, will make up a larger and larger percentage of their portfolio. To mitigate this increase in risk, one would traditionally sell some of their riskier investments and invest in relatively less risky investments.
I hope that was clear and clarifies why what you've written makes no sense to me.

Not looking for legal advice on Reddit. I'll leave that to my lawyer.
Only looking for people in the same boat.

Being late to the proof of work game comes with some significant disadvantages. Unless you can develop a proof of work that can isolate itself from the current Bitcoin mining hardware, your coin will be vulnerable to a 51% attack.
Good luck.
