20 years ago this summer marks the beginning of the modern internet. Why? Cause that's when the Mosaic browser was released. It had img support!

I've been using a laser cutter for a few months now, mostly making paper art. This herb grinder with a lasered Bitcoin B is my first product to sell. If there is any interest on Etsy I'll be launching a full e-commerce store sooner than later. I'm also open to any ideas for bitcoin related laser etches. Thanks for checking it out.

The free market will take care of Mt Gox and similar problems. Yesterday's actions have done irreversible damage to Mt Gox and customers are abandoning them. We need more killer apps. Keep coding my friends and you'll gain valuable customers.

Yes and No. Etsy allows for "Other" payment options when creating a store. When a customer chooses Other, I believe the "order" goes through with no money exchange. Then it's up to store owner and customer to settle up, and bitcoin is my preference. This page explains a bit more:

I personally prefer the wood ones, and I also like the metal ones with pollen catchers. I'll be lasering some metals ones as soon as they arrive.

nice to know. The kickstarter concept is sure to expand beyond product/business building, especially with such portable currencies. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 12:16:16
That is a great question. Hmm, I wonder if coins could be held temporarily in escrow.

So he's saying that the exchange tax is always gonna be here. My reply: People rarely exchange their currency-of-choice. When a currency becomes useful exchanges aren't used that often. He sounds a 'bit' scared ;)

I could see walmart pushing the envelope here. They're all about the bottom dollar and efficiency

This reminds me of an idea I had years ago called "The Donate-Back Subscription Model" where
Subscribers buy Donation Dollars and give those dollars directly back to authors, sections, features, and user generated content. 
Reader Jill buys a $20 subscription to her local paper. The paper collects the $20 payment from Jill. The paper empowers Jill to "donate" her subscription fees directly to authors and other users at her discretion.  When she values content she can donate to that content's donation channel.

We won't have govt in a few years. We the people, we the internet have already one. Who's more powerful: the US gov't or our collective powers? We, of course are more powerful. It only takes a mind-shift to change the world. Bombs are always less powerful than words. Always. This is why smart ideas always win. Yes there are growing pains before we grow tall.  People applying pain will be removed.

got it, thanks

Oh I think you were very clear, just these concepts take a sec to grasp, kinda like learning a new card game.

Even if the MSM does not anoint thee, any and all efforts to promote bitcoin are beneficial.

Would anybody like their cards better if they looked like my first draft of card designs? 
@_date: 2013-04-15 05:44:01
alright, I'm convinced, I also must have one...
@_date: 2013-04-15 05:40:37
Yeah I'd love to. Have any requests?

Great questions. Recently, I obtained a Full Spectrum 40W Hobby laser cutter ( and I've had a blast with it. It cost around $3k. Laser cutters do two basic functions: cutting through a material, and just etching a surface. The Full Sprectrum laser cuts paper and etches wood just fine, but I've had bad luck cutting through the thinnest of wood sheets. I also joined ATX Hackerspace where they have a much stronger machine. This stronger laser cuts through wood with ease. The etching found on this grinder can be done equally as well with both machines. When setting up a final cut or etch I typically use a lot material in testing. After using sample wood pieces I still ruined several grinders while optimizing the settings and adjusting the files. Not all shapes, sizes, and techniques works well in this medium.

One use case related to politics would be to survey the potential donors to campaigns before the actual donating. On the consumer level, consumers could be surveyed to see how much they would spend on a product. Currently people can be anonymously surveyed and income is a common question. This idea of counting a voter's coin is a refinement of that income data.

Hi thanks for your interest in the Bitcoin Herb Grinders. I'll take some more photos of them tomorrow. I've used wood grinders for years and can't recall any damages to one. I have misplaced them though. I prefer these wood ones over the metals ones. I'm also working on some new designs including a reversed-out Bitcoin B logo. And metal ones soon after. Stayed tuned. Or let me know if you'd like to purchase one without going through Etsy.

Thanks dude, in the mail tomorrow. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 13:03:09
it took me sec to get that, and then your last paragraph made it clear. Yeah thats a great idea worth exploring further, thanks
