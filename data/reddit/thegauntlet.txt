Typically stocks and mutual funds trade at 6 months their intended price. That is why when a company announces its quarterly profits being positive, a lot of times the stock drops. The investors were expecting a profit of $x / share and only got $y / share.

I reinstalled and no longer see 'testnet' so I assume I am now on mainnet. I read before that everyone would have to re-list items for sale with the switch, but i still see I have all kinds of items for sale. Deleting all the fake posts I guess.

This is the type of thing that ruins bitcoin. Not core v classic, not people bashing it and calling it dead, but this. This is a blatant attempt to hijack and disrupt the very foundations that bitcoin was built on for their own gain and monopoly.

Will the bitcoin miners still be 'mining' these transactions on the blockchain or does Overstock have to handle their own transactions. Also how much does the volatility in bitcoin effect the issuance of these new shares?

I figure a lot of people are selling as it is the end of the year. Time to pay all their taxes. They have seen a nice growth over the last year, cash out to pay the man.

I've just been mining for a long time, never really began looking into the 'what makes bitcoin work' until last few months so just curious.
@_date: 2015-12-13 00:04:25
I thought it wouldn't be until 2140 before all coins are mined?
@_date: 2015-12-26 17:20:45
explain? link?

I can put them on different ips and different routers.
@_date: 2015-12-29 15:39:01
Using a AMD Debian box with 8GB DDR3 ram. Drive is 250 GB SSD (I was told i need just 80GB so I went with a small drive. It will have a dedicated IP also. 
The other PC is a little smaller CPU, 128GB SSD, Debian, and 4GB ram. I can increase the ram to 8GB as I have some sticks not being used. 
Are these sufficient? I was told you could run a node off a raspberry pi si was figuring it isn't too intensive.
@_date: 2015-12-29 12:53:36
I am sick thinking of the girls I'd impress telling I have a full bitcoin node to.

I just bought 10 BTC. Last month, i was reminiscing of the days of buying bitcoin for below $100 a coin. Shit, 4 months ago it was in the $200 range. Told myself if it drops again, buy what I can. 
@_date: 2016-01-09 06:09:22
I'd just run a antminer U3. At least in the low GH region instead of MH
@_date: 2016-01-12 03:09:06
Coinbase can but only from coinbase to coinbase wallets I thought. I haven't looked into this since September so maybe changed.
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:04:34
I wouldn't call it a correction, not even profit taking. There are a few real things that happened this week that caused the price to drop. Are they legit...sure. Will they have any bearing over the next week or so, probably...after that...no one will care and people will move on. The price of BTC is on sale...be happy.
@_date: 2016-01-09 15:52:16
Antminer U3 are no longer made and only on ebay. When buying miners, make sure they have never been overclocked. Some people run them too hot and don't have them in a air conditioned room.
@_date: 2016-03-26 16:22:29
When will it be out of testnet? I think I read that will need to re-install and re-setup your store when the switch is made. That is what is keeping me from going all out with OB
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:59:56
I look at it as Bitcoin is having a sale. Just bought me 10 coins for the low low sale price of $384

We actually are getting ready to accept recurring subscriptions using smart contracts with Ethereum. Unfortunately adoption of btc vs eth is even lower but will be offering easy steps to convert, etc. Expect only a handful of people to use it.

Pssshh...I'm not buying until it is below $500. I just hate sitting in cash. I don't feel part of the cool kids club.
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:27:40
again on DAO? geez. Guess I'll head over to that sub and find out what happened. Never laughed so much about losing $20k in my life.
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:17:29
Any idea why the price of BTC is tanking all of the sudden? Are the chinese pulling out?
@_date: 2016-02-19 01:48:29
no, it can't be done. Miners are ASICs, they are specifically designed for a single function and that is all they can do.
That being said, there is a cryptocurrency called primecoin where they search for primes as proof of work or something. I ready about it several months ago. Quick google search produced this article: 
@_date: 2016-02-22 09:40:21
Is there a faq or something you can point me to for this.
@_date: 2016-02-19 13:32:54
You can. It might vary per state what and how much you can collect on this. I always had a 'payment is due in 30 days' clause but never enforced. At 60 days a friendly reminder. I still wanted to be someone they placed ads with. Then at 90 days I got a bit worried and emailed again. If I'd get a response and they were making amends, I was fine. If I was ignored, I'd move up the later and begin phone calls. Collections only happened for me when the CEO of a company stated he'd never approve ads for a $15 CPM (he signed the contract plus he was CC'd on the emails from his ad buyer) and another company was going bankrupt and I didn't know how to proceed so I got a debt collector there too. 
If it needs to get a lawyer involved, expect to lose another 20 - 30% also. This is were you have your debt collector offer a settle and compromise as a last ditch before filing a lawsuit.
@_date: 2016-02-18 22:15:32
I've been in the same boat before. I take payment after ad campaigns are finished. On occasion, I have had to use a collection agent. Sucks loosing 20% but always got me my money.
@_date: 2016-05-31 17:33:44
yup, at 2am, I dumped all but 1 bitcoin. It was a very bittersweet moment and I am quite upset still by it. I am kinda in shock by how selling made me feel.

With the stock market, stocks are typically about 6 months out for their price so any announcements are already factored in unless some big news story breaks. Around when would you say the next halving has already been factored in? These are more easily predicted so I am guessing any price jump is minor.
@_date: 2016-05-31 17:31:54
Not just is the price not very good, but the TH/s isn't either. Based on the expected difficulty and halving, this takes you to about mid January for daily/weekly reward. If this is expected to last around 1 year, people will be losing money fast. This also doesn't take into account the electricity increase over the S7 either.

does only bitpay do this? I went Coinbase as a quick google search brought their api, sandbox, and dev area up and took less than 1 hour to setup.
@_date: 2016-05-11 23:43:44
okay, will check them out.
@_date: 2016-05-11 05:08:05
Most bands like payouts via Paypal. I am preaching bitcoin to them, but not a ton of acceptance yet.
