That's a tradeoff between centralization and decentralization.
Decentralized exchanges (DEX) will be safe from something like Chinese exchange ban. Also, if the DEX got hacked, then damage will be limited since it's decentralized.
Don't know how DEX without a smartcontract work though. Usually, a smartcontract will make an exchange become trustless.

It's operating. I withdrew fiat to my debit card just fine, but my new credit card stuck in pending state for weeks now.
