What about all they financial majors who could not spot the 2008 bubble and are in the dark about the up and coming crash in the Stock Market? QE will only hold the market up so long before reality sets in and when that happens people will run to Gold and Bitcoin just like in 2008 but Bitcoin was not around then.

Its because we have an independence referendum this year. Witch will give us the chance to leave the UK. We use the pound and England have been using scare tactics, saying if we leave the UK we can't use the £. This is a lie as they can't stop us using it. But some other Scots have a better idea. Lets ditch the Fiat and move to Crypto which we could peg to Bitcoin for example.

My name is Derek Nisbet, and I am the founder of The Scotcoin Project.
Born in Edinburgh, I spent my ‘formative’ years in and around the Lothians, before relocating in 1995 to Wiltshire, England, where I joined a small software based start-up.
In 1999, I received a job offer to join the German Futures Exchange in Frankfurt, working on the Alliance of CBOT &amp; Eurex project, or a/c/e as it was known.
I spent a quite a few years living between Chicago &amp; Frankfurt which was a fantastic experience and connected with so many amazing people from the UK, Europe &amp; the USA.
Following this, I formed a Technology business in Germany, which did well until it took a huge hit in 2002, and was no more!
In 2003, I re-located to London and worked with a leading trading technology firm, where I spent 3 years in London, before re-locating in 2006, to the New York branch to head up their Sales &amp; Marketing effort for New York City.
In 2010 I joined a Fortune 500 technology firm as a Sales Executive, again in New York City.
In 2011, I decided to remove myself from the financial world, shortly after MF Global got ‘busted’ – I decided that no longer did I wish to participate in this financial world.
From then on, I became interested in physical Gold and Silver &amp; then …. BITCOIN!  I have spent the last few years building opportunities in the Bitcoin space and love the innovation it has created.  I  am also extremely grateful to have met some of the most intelligent, exciting &amp; innovative entrepreneurs around today, via the new crypto-currency world.
Thanks to all of this, I am pleased to take the lead on The Scoticoin Project.  Never, has it been easier to really make a change in this world, especially in Scotland and for the Scottish people.
My ‘intentions are honourable’ and my motivation is simply to build something that has yet to be done – Create, a thriving digital economy in Scotland,  where the Scottish people are offered an alternative medium of exchange, which can help to build, develop and create new &amp; innovative opportunities. 
I hope you all will support this project and let’s make this happen!
Please feel free to either email me at derek or connect with me on Linkedin.
My best regards
Derek N.

Someone posted this in Bitcoin marketplace.
semarjBullish 6 points 10 hours ago*
So I thought I'd throw in a little bit of knowledge I gained from my recent experience with Gox. (My last withdrawal from them took about 72 hours, this was maybe 2 months ago)
I learned from their IRC channel (LOTs of poking and prodding and questions, though not from any employees mind you, that would be too easy) that the reason they are having withdrawal problems is related to freshly minted coins.
New coins must have 100 confirmations before being spent. The trouble is, that Gox does not keep track of what coins are what. They essentially keep them all in the same bucket.
They issue withdrawals, and if 0.0001 of the coins coming to you came from a mining reward less than 100 blocks ago, you've just produced an invalid transaction. Your account debits, but you get nothing. Your coins are in limbo.
This would explain the random nature of the failed tx. Also smaller tx's would have a higher chance of success since larger ones have a higher chance to include new coins.
To me this means:
Miners are selling more coins sooner.
Gox is too incompetent to solve this MAJOR but solvable issue in 2 months.
just FYI, make what you will of this information.
EDIT: after writing this I have thought a bit and maybe this is not really whats going on. Firstly, are miners pointing their reward address at Gox? Doesn't seem likely since they claim to change it (though i have accidentally reused a deposit address months later and had it work. 2nd, 100 confirms is about 17 hours, not the 72 i experienced. I will leave this here though for others to discuss.

Putting words in peoples mouths is know way to win a debate. You think this "So are you happy with QE then? The FED printing something like 85 million a day. You fine with that ehh? Also most of what you wrote is propaganda not facts."  and  "I don't want money printed by private institutions. "The same people who run the big banks run the FED. I don't want them printing money with interest added to it. Governments could or at least should print debt free money. Look up JFK and Abraham Lincoln who used this power".
Your translation
"You shouldn't be. You're contradicting yourself. You just said you want the government to control all money. And now you against the control of money? Like earlier you said Fed is printing too much money, then you want the Congress to print more cheap money? To benefit society, sure. You don't know what you're talking about." 
Am talking about the interest that is added by the FED. I mention governments can print it debt free. I'v not once said i want governments to control all money. 
@_date: 2013-07-27 14:49:43
They are owned by 5 corporations. Look at who owns those corporations.

@_date: 2013-12-23 19:18:19
So who do you think should control the money? In an ideal world Bitcoin would be the way forward. Proper Free market.
Also this all started because you started to defend the FED by say its a Government agency. Thats why we are having this debate
I also said "I don't want them printing money with interest added to it. Governments could or at least should print debt free money. Look up JFK and Abraham Lincoln who used this power." So how does that mean "you want bigger government controlling all the money" Also that's not what the article is saying its criticising the FED on how its run.

So what about the 6% dividend that is paid to private shareholders that is mentioned on the federal reserve own website? 
Alan Greenspan: “Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency, and that means, basically, that there is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take. So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don’t frankly matter.”
So is the former head of the FED talking crap then?? Why do the Rothschild's own shares in the FED? 
Haha the US is turning into a dictatorship. The illusion of a 2 party system is a joke. Why do they always follow the same plans? Bush/Obama.  
So are you happy with QE then? The FED printing something like 85 million a day. You fine with that ehh? Also most of what you wrote is propaganda not facts.

and with american news you get what? A well balanced opinion? I have seen many articles from RT regarding russia and not all have been positive. However i'm from the UK and am more interested in news regarding the US/UK. If i get a more balance opinion from RT regarding these countries than the BBC or CNN then am happy with RT. So how is this article miss leading? It was not written by a Russian. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:01:37
Printing by Fed is bad, but printing by the President is worse. I want less bad, not more.
Do you know anything about Interest? The fed add interest. Also Inland revenue was set up in 1913. The same year as the FED. That's not a coincidence. 
Free markets don't exist that's the problem. The people who run the FED run the banks and the Oil and the energy company's and so on. its crony capitalism we have. I wish we had real free markets. if that was the case. The bailout wouldn't have happened. That is against true capitalism.

The BBC has a bias. It's a government mouth piece. It didn't cover the world wide march against Monsanto for example. This was including protests in the UK. Why would a news organization not mention this? Yes world wide march. RT covered it well. They also have a lot of american and British staff. Haters gona hate. The american news channels are by far some of the biggest lot of rubbish on TV.

They don't cover most of the main issues effecting the US they focus on stupid stories. Look at Edward Snowden, they only focus on him and not the information he has leaked. They lie when they need too.They are propaganda networks. Owned by 5 corporations. Whatever their owners want you believe is the view they will take. Look at the Nazi Bill O'Reilly's show, its disgrace.
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:29:40
"It's irrelevant who is paid with that 6%." ehh its not. Because that alone proves its a private institution run by shareholders. What other government agency has shareholders? Greenspan is saying its “Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency" Not government agency. Like the IMF or world bank.
"You either don't read or don't understand what I'm saying. I want less government centralization, not more. I fail to see how 500 million printed by the Congress to spend on Medicare or whatever would be better than money printed by Fed." 
I don't want money printed by private institutions. The same people who run the big banks run the FED. I don't want them printing money with interest added to it. Governments could or at least should print debt free money. Look up JFK and Abraham Lincoln who used this power. 
"If you want all money to be controlled by the Congress or the President directly, like Mugabe or Lukashenko, you clearly came to the wrong place."
This is just a stupid (Propaganda) comment. Yeah only dictators control money supplies. Government used to before 1913. Same here in the UK. The bank of england was sold of to private hands.

I'll ask again, What other government agency has shareholders?
"Ok I have a very bad news for you: Bitcoin is a private issued money created to disrupt the government money monopoly. You goal obviously is the opposite - to strengthen the money monopoly in the government hands. You really came to the wrong place." I most likley have more Bitcoin than you. And yes i'm happy Bitcoin is fighting against control of the money supply. Money that is printed by private institutions only benefiting the small % of shareholders. Like the Rothschild family.

They are keeping the price of gold and silver low to try and stop people switching there money from fiat to precious metals. However if you look at the demand for physical gold then you can see this is not working as demand has sky rocketed. I'v been waiting over 3 weeks for my gold delivery.
