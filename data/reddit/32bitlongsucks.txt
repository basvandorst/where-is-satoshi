that's exactly the point of open source, great programmers and engineers working for free. Not as many as work for money, but enough of us do support projects that we like or use. And in general there's no reward and even if a project gets popular and worth tons of money non of that goes back into the pockets of the developers. If you want to make money in general working for open source projects isn't the way to go.
Some people like the cause and donate money or start foundations to support the projects. But none of the money made by bitcoin will support the technology unless you specifically donate bitcoins or money to projects you want to support.

why those scissors are in mint condition and that calculator has the really big numbers. 
The only thing that worries me is that there are keys to open an atm in the picture. I heard posting pictures of keys is a bit of an security risk.  And workplace safety would probably complain about the power cable in the middle of the room, somebody could fall because of that, better tape it down.

it's not unusable but you should see the amount of rage in my eyes when:
  * when a small store doesn't accept my credit card
  * when a ATM wants me to pay fees for using my debit card
If i'd try to survive a month of bitcoin i'd be pissed of all the time.
I don't think getting things online will every be a problem for bitcoin. For me something isn't usable when i need to carry 3 other options to be sure i won't be fucked. And at this point credit cards are the most viable option to me, mostly because i can use them to get cash for free everywhere. I want a single option that works everywhere and if widely adopted options like credit cards can't do it after years. I'll be probably very dead until bitcoin does it.

if you bought at 4k you're up 50% that's pretty decent compared to other investments. If you think it's going down you should probably just take that great return of investment and be happy.
I think the risk at the moment is hard to estimate. Could go up could go down i don't really see a path at the moment. But with the money in your bank you can reevaluate the situation without having to worry about losing anything. You can still get back in. You might not make some gains but on the other hand you won't make some losses. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 09:30:24
this is the biggest bullshit i ever red. What he calls efficiency is just the total power consumption... I guess he made lots of estimations, should have continued with the amount of transactions made with bitcoin and the banking system and just devide the power numbers. That would probably be somewhat helpful. 
But thanks to his estimates we now know that all the worlds banks only need to handle 3 times as many transactions as the bitcoin network. My conservative estimation is that banks are more efficient. They probably adjusted the difficulty because they don't have enough hash power.

OP said he earns under 2 dollars, take away the two transaction fees you need to make (1 to buy bitcoin and 1 to buy something with bitcoin). You're already at a rather big loss no matter how low the fees are.
At that point i'd probably recommend starting to invest in consumables that you can buy with no fee at all. I'd probably focus on food it's not just a store of value, it can also keep you alive. But alcohol, cigarettes or any useful supplies are probably nice to have.

well the risk reward calculation is pretty simple and everyone factors it in. It's one of the first things you learn in a strategy lecture. You have to compare different investements and estimate their risks and chances. And the article isn't about that at all, it's basically just the start of a risk reward calculation -&gt; high chances for total loss. 
estimated chance for good outcome * estimated gains - estimated chance for bad outcome * extimated losses.
So your 10x estimated would have to happen with an probability of at least 10% for you to break even, it's the basics and everyone should know it. And it's pretty much how i value bitcoin. I see a big chance of a total loss and a small chance for big gains. Compared to money on the bank where i see no gains and a guaranteed loss and stocks where i have small almost guaranteed gains.
So basically bitcoin for me is gambling on an unlikely outcome, while stocks will most likely secure my retirement. If i wouldn't want to have a rather secure retirement i'd probably gamble more. But in the end how likely each event is is your estimation nobody knows. I think your 20% chance for 10x is rather optimistic and even then i wouldn't risk my retirement for a 1/5 chance.

since the problem usually is owning and distribution probably not. The bank in general shouldn't know what is in the vault and it shouldn't distribute it.
Which is probably how the block chain should work, isn't it all about crypto so why isn't it using crypto for the data? Wouldn't be a problem then. But if it is publicly accessible cp or even any other copyrighted material this will become a legal nightmare for anyone that has a copy of the blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:00:39
same thing, critical infrastructure that's what you target. Information, transport, power, ... what would you hit when shit goes down? empty fields? WW3 isn't a joke, that shits gonna end civilization as we know it and bomb us back into the past a fair bit. And that's the good outcome in my theories.

pretty easy to estimate: $700,000,000 
Bitcoin Volume of the last 24h: $4,560,090,000
that means we'd change the daily volume by about 2.5%. There's people who own billions in bitcoin right now. Market manipulation isn't going to be that easy. And hoping that everyone here is loving bitcoin and wants to invest even more and more with such a high risk is madness. Most people don't want to and shouldn't.

@_date: 2018-02-07 06:24:27
that's a simple predictions. Just like most startups most ICOs will just be a complete loss. You should expect that and you should prepare for that case if you invest into a startup.
In addition to that many of the currency coins will fail because it's very unlike that more than 2-3 will find wide spread adoption. In addition to that there might be a place for some of them just for speculation/as asset.
Some will call it crash or bubble, but it's just the reality of the market. The strong will survive and the weak will run away with your money.

most protocols are based on math, it's what engineers do. Doesn't mean there's no unexpected inputs or maybe even a programming error. Looked at it, it's long and complicated, i don't even pretend that i understand it. But if history thought us anything it is that long and complicated things and if you do unexpected things with them they might break. Might take years until someone figures out a way to do it. But one day someone will find an apparently stupid bug in a extremely important system and everyone says "that shouldn't have happened!" but than again things like The Heartbleed Bug happen. Very important system, very well understood very stupid bug, shit happens. No system is perfect it even happens to the real important stuff like SSL that should be a lesson to everyone who feels 100% secure. If you're playing for defense you can't really win, all you try to do is not to lose.  
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:41:13
can say the same for 1k, google search correlation says at least 4k with a downward trend. So yeah, if i say it like a good technical analyst. If we stay above todays level of bitcoin for three days we've reached the bottom of this dip and we're ready head toward 10k as long as no other dip starts happening. If we don't stay at the level and go under the suport we will keep dropping to 7k where a reversal might happen. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 11:52:08

There's just very few good ones and tons of shitty ones that just cover all possibilities with at least 1 bearish and 1 bullish scenario. I once red an Article about how not to be wrong and it was basically about that. Tell people about both possible outcomes and hope they forget that you told them about the one that didn't happen. 
I think just reading the news helps a lot more and even then you have to be careful with the sources.

@_date: 2018-03-12 18:42:58
protocols aren't like physics, they use physics. But they contain many spots that can be attacked and abused, it's really easy to break a protocol. Well at least comparing to breaking physics it's trivial. It's what hackers do all day long.
@_date: 2018-03-13 12:27:53
I never thought about this and i don't understand it. Don't you just have to set the interest rate high enough? If the interest rate improves your net value more then the increasing value you should be good lending?
Imo Increasing value won't stop people from borrowing. All that will happen is higher interest rates. But without borrowing money people won't be able to afford cars, homes or sometimes even education. That seems to be a sad alternative.
@_date: 2018-03-24 07:51:58
well at the moment it is almost impossible to access, but i am pretty sure after the news and now that bitcoins is this popular people will try to find ways to abuse this. So in general i'd be very careful and keep an eye on it.
But on the same time i hope that there's smart people trying to find solutions for this problem. Because yes if there's any illegal/copyrighted content and someone makes it easily accessible/abusable bitcoin will be in a lot of trouble in many countries. 
So my conclusion so far is that there is no need to sell yet, but if the problem keeps getting bigger i will flee the sinking ship. But so far it just seemed to be a fluke/sensational news. We'll have to see what the future brings.

even if crypto becomes a currency there will be people who need to borrow money to build a house, buy a car or just go to college. 
So as long as debt is a thing there will be banks (or your crypto equivalent of banks). So people who think switching to another currency will change our life, no. It will be the same shit as soon as it gets widely adopted. The price fluctuations will stop and people will need to borrow money. 
You can call it whatever you like but currencies and banks won't stop existing. You just start calling one crypto and the other crypto bank and think that will change anything. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 12:27:24
well that's why most "old school" investors say bitcoin has fatal flaws as a currency. And i look at it even more pessimistic and i worry that not even mining will stay profitable enough if there is a longer period where people just aren't that interested in bitcoin the network might just die. Less transactions and more expensive mining means more expensive transactions, which will lead to even less transactions. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 05:44:16
i am not sure if a joke or not.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:55:52
i did it all by thinking! i know i surprised myself doing it. But if you think hard about where all the bitcoins are it might happen to you just as it did happen to me. The exchanges have them! It's like thinking about where all the money is, it is probably banks isn't it? 
Is it good that banks have the money? maybe, maybe bad. So i even agree that it's not a good sign, but not a bad sign either. To be honest it's just like i expected it to be, strange world we live in. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 14:39:48
at the moment we're retesting the 9k support, if we break it we might be in for a bull run towards 11-12k in the next few week. But if we fail to we'll retest the support at 8 the bearish downtrend line forms the classic double mountainside shape which could lead to a drop to 7k over the same time span.  
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:42:47
yeah so don't buy high, because it will most likely crash and might come back multiple years later. 
If you bought low you're fine and up but looking at the volume a shit ton of people bought way over 10k and all of them are fucked big time. losing 50% of a portfolio is a big setback that's 10 years or more of investing in stock with good gains. Or praying for bitcoin to make another magical comeback that is even better then the last one. I hate praying. 20k buyers even need a 200% increase to just break even again. 
So my moral of the story is that you shouldn't buy bitcoin in the times when every dickhead seems to call it the future money and is really hyped about it. Just wait another few months until nobody cares anymore and then might be a god time to buy. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 11:57:36

well if you maxed it out you're not buying the dip anymore. And if people like you who buy the dip are out of money and have credits i see the price to drop further. 
People like you will have to sell just to pay of all their debts, which will put more Presseure on the price.

I don't know where you're from but around here nobody can just save up the 400-500k you need to buy a house. At the point you get there you already worked for half a lifetime or you're dead. In both cases i probably wouldn't invest half a million just to hope for another 20 good years. Oh yeah and i wouldn't have half a million because i paid 300k of that for the rent if i don't want to sleep under a bridge for 30 years.

you have to be careful where you get your news. Of course there's lots of good new here on a page that supports bitcoin and is very invested in it. Just like you won't find a bad word about racism on KKK-Weekly. You really should try to expand your news horizon if you think the bitcoin news nowadays are good in general. 
In Bitcoin unrelated media i have barely seen any news about bitcoin lately (not even the technology sites i read on a regular basis talk about crypto anymore), a few wrote about g20. Which wasn't too bad and led to a small price spike. But in general the big news lost most of their interest in bitcoin and the rare news lately focus mostly on power consumption and loss of value this year. It's just not as exciting as a exponential growth and a doubling of the price every few weeks. It's hard to get new money in with those kind of news and only new money and interest will lead to a rise in bitcoin price in my opinion. 
And thank god people stopped talking so much about the technology of the future that will replace banks. I hated that and as an engineer i know how much people care about the actual technology behind things - they give zero fucks! So when the most stupid of my school friends started talking to me about decentralized networks and how it will revolutionize the world i got very suspicious. Thank god the world is back to normal again and unlike bitcoin makes people rich fast again i don't think they care too much about the system that manages their bank account. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:48:56

i basically just google bitcoin and check the news of the last 24 hours. But so far i haven't seen a big correlation between specific news and the price. The sentiment seems to be way more important, but a lot harder to figure out. At the moment it still feels like people are very suspicious of crypto and there isn't much trust. So i don't expect any fast gains at least for the next few days.

To be honest i don't think their opinion has to be right or important, but what really pisses me off is the people on Reddit who call them stupid and tell them to fuck off. Those two did more good than most of us ever did and ever will do, both have foundations that give away millions every year for good causes. Even though you might not agree with them you don't have to be a dick about it. (not talking about this post, but if you look at this sub in general you'll see what i mean)
People who just scream asshole when someone has a different opinion are whats wrong with this world. And the only people i know doing this are the ones who don't try to learn new things, so everyone who calls gates or buffet an idiot and tells me they know more about bitcoin than they do is probably just a uneducated bigot who invested more into bitcoin then they should have and is fucking scared because of that.

Buffet is an inspiration to me, he probably knows more about bitcoin then most of us. He always was well informed, well red and made smart decisions. That's why i don't think it is different this time. But he also said that he only invests in things he understands and there might be part of the bitcoin he personally just doesn't value as much as others. I can understand that he has a different kind of trust in a system that made him extremely rich. I don't think i'd see the need of a decentralized system if i could play the current system as well as he can. So i think his estimation of bitcoins value is very important but it might not be what happens in the end.
Still anyone who calls him old fart and clueless is just ignorant and should learn a bit more about him. There's not many people who have a better understanding of the market and speculation. And especially with all the new money going into bitcoin, bitcoin is more and more about speculation and less and less about the technology.

yeah the government talks i heard haven't been about the blockchain, they talked about the demand for an electronic currency. Which will be government controlled, have a stable price and the government will know where all of it is at any given time. That means no black market or paying your drug dealer with cash anymore. 
But most decent countries have enough privacy law to make sure they can not make those transactions public. And police will most likely need a warrant to check your transactions.  
If they use the blockchain or any other kind of technology doesn't really change anything for anyone anyway. 
But than again this is a problem for future me. If i had to guess i'd say it will take at least 10 years for governments to start first pilot projects and probably more like 20-30 for this to work. And maybe in 50 we can get rid of paper money.

weather you call it crash or correction doesn't really matter. Weather it's a crash or correction for you depends probably mostly on when you bought. A year ago? your fine! A month ago, and your basically fucked. I'd call that a crash. Hoping for another 100% upwards movement isn't a very rational thing to do. And many people look at bitcoin and expect that to happen on a regular basis.

It's not about pointing at people it's about who pays for using the bandwidth. And telekom pays a shitload of money (~8 billion) to use the bandwidth. While an antminer shouldn't even send out radio signals at all. There's no reason for it to do that. So they pay for the right to point fingers and they pay a lot.
And mobile networks don't kill our brains, we're using them for a long time now and we're fine.

Your first problem is that you say Bitcoin and mean the technology used by Bitcoin. The technology might change parts of the world most people will never know or care about. But Bitcoin will stay an investment at least in the foreseeable future.

I don't think so. No control is basically one of the bitcoin mantras. Volatility is high because people jump on and off bitcoin, in the long term i expect the user base to stabilize and with that the value of a bitcoin. So for now we'll have to live with it and to be honest i think it's what many people like about bitcoin, fast way to get rich or poor. A stable bitcoin would probably be a lot less attractive and a lot more usable. But than again i don't expect that to happen in the next 5-10 years. People are greedy and you can't buy shit with bitcoin, that will slow down the adoption of bitcoin as a currency.

If I'd be sure i would but i am not. All i do is seeing it crash a lot faster then i expected it too. That leads me to think that there will probably be a upwards correction (like the one over the weekend).

@_date: 2018-02-01 19:08:36
To be honest i haven't checked how it works and even though i might not fudder yet that doesn't mean i won't start. There's definitly risks to the new system. There's now transactions happening that aren't on the blockchain, which might cause problems, but it's complicated and apparently there's no security risks. In addition to that theres less money for the backend which should usually mean less backend. But than again, haven't red enough about it to say anything bad or good about it. Seems good so far, might come with a price though. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:55:59
i hope not that would mean it will never go up again. just down down down until there is no going down anymore.
I blame the general news cycle, things only stay news for so long. Usually half a year after that people don't want to read about it anymore. Usually there's a new epidemic, a exploding nuclear reactor or a surprising president. And after about half a year interest just drops. It was a fun ride and now we're back to a more stable world, which i personal like a lot more. Humans are fucking stupid herd animals all running after the next big thing just to find out that if you stare at it for long enough it is just as boring as the last. 
At the moment i'd say we're in the very speculative phase. Lot's of people making lots of money by the changing prices but that means just as many people will have to lose money. That's how the game works. And since i am not 100% convinced that there is no market manipulation going on in the bitocin world i'd say the money goes towards the rich people.
Got a bad day, so my world view might be a bit too pessimistic today. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:35:00
well at least not in india. And i hope not in my country. 
Governments like to control money (and they should). Afterall you don't want to live at a place where all the money just disappears over night. And that's the reason why i think that will never happen. Governments will never give up their control over what amount of value goes in and out of a country. And saying that governments can't control bitcoin is a lie, they can and they will. I think most will follow indias example, don't allow it as a currency in anyway or put an end to the privacy (like korea) to make sure they can add taxes and have some kind of customs. But the technology will survive, but that also means that bitcoin will most likely lose most of its value in the long term. No need for a currency that can't be used anywhere. But many tokens based on companies might still be very interesting, on the other hand with regulations and more popularity that will become more and more like the regular stock market. And imo it will take another 2-3 years until people see big ICOs going bankrupt and noticing that most of them are bullshit. Reminds me a bit of growdfunding, seemed awsome - led to lots of disappointment. I'd say the big money making days of crypto are over and it will become a lot harder for companies to get money just for mentioning blockchain and people will learn why it is risky to invest in startups (once more).
@_date: 2018-02-16 09:48:30
That's not really going after the bitcoin network, it's going after everyone who sends radio signals in the bandwidth they pay for. If antminers generate radio frequencies and you have one you should take the necessary steps to prevent it from doing that by adding some shielding, it's usually neither hard to do nor expensive. But if you kill a mobile network (or radio stations, etc. ) they will look for you, find you, make you stop and pay for the losses. Which could be a very expensive bill, so better make sure you don't send out radio signals.

as long as bitcoin isn't going upwards again you actually win by getting out. At least that's my understanding of how it works. But i should check again if keeping something that's going down might actually earn me money.
@_date: 2018-02-04 07:25:52
It was report for almost all of last year that there will be a big correction. Even my uninformed finance adviser told me it might be a bad time to invest because there's most likely going to be a correction this year. 
but i don't think it will lose 50% of it's value in a week, so bitcoin might still win the price for steepest drop this year (and maybe a few years to come). 
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:18:48
well if you compare it to the alternative i would say yes definitely. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:23:20
Its a bug risk, a year in Bitcoin could be anything from complete loss to big gains. If your calculations are right your probably fine. I wouldn't do it,but that's just my pessimistic few about bitcoin.
In general i'd recommend you to diversify your investment. If I just check this year my stocks earned me more than Bitcoin. So there might be other options with less risk of total loss. in addition to that you should check the tax situation. You might have to gamble on big Bitcoin gains to make significant money after taxes and interest s on your credit.

@_date: 2018-02-26 15:53:18
yeah any company could implement a blockchain without having to pay miners. They'd just provide the network themselves. Which most of them will do.
But you have to differentiate the bitcoin blockchain and those technologies. Those technologies won't be based on coins, they'll be there to manage big networks of farms or mines that are part of a single company. PoW won't be as important to those network, they'll only be used by a few rather trusted nodes. And Power consumption is actually a concern there, so i'd say there will be less power hungry technologies that are more fit to work in a rather controlled network. But whether or not blockchain works a lot better then systems we have right now and whether or not it is an improvement over centralized network architectures will be something only the future will tell us.

yeah i like my time on reddit, sometimes it's a fun place to be, sometimes it's a shit show but almost always entertaining. And i was calling you out for taking a 11 week course and starting to call everyone a casual on your first day on reddit. Most people would probably start with something less aggravating when joining a new community. 
And yeah i'd like to have made 6 figures, but i am not mad at you for making them. Hate to see people losing money, that's why i tell people i think it will keep going down and most ICOs are scams or just highly risky investments. But for people to listen to me first i might have to do an 11 week course first or like any other person i could just read up anything i want about bitcoin right from the developers because it's open source and easily available. Just look at the whitepapers and look through the code. Apparently you're a lot smarter then the average casual user here and a well trained programmer so it shouldn't be a problem for you.
But than again i don't think the technology and the value at the moment are related in anyway, that's part of why i spread fear uncertainty and doubt. I enjoy the technology i like the block chain and crypto, well cryptography will always be important, but that doesn't make bitcoins valuable in anyway. And because of that i think fear, uncertainty and doubt are the feelings you should have when thinking about your bitcoin investments. And anyone who says it isn't a risky investment is, in my honest opinion, just delusional.

@_date: 2018-02-02 05:58:44
Not sure, india and korea might have set a precedent that other countries follow (more control, less anonymity and accepting the technology but not the currency). In my opinion that pokes a bit whole in the dream about bitcoin many people have. And if more countries act in a similar way the price might drop further and further. In addition to that i still don't see any good bitcoin news, just news about drops and bubbles bursting. So i personally wait until the news forget about bitcoin. But that is because i think bitcoin price depends a lot on the press coverage and the bad news make it rather unlikely for new people to start investing. So imo we will go from bad press, to no press (which will be the time i might buy) and after that i hope there will be good press again. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:49:49
it's whatever you want it to be.You just have to write it at the right time of any given day and you'll be right about almost anny 1 digit and even some 2 digit percent changes of bitcoin in either direction.
imo the volatility is still going on (i don't dare to call it crash oor correction anymore, people get sentimental about those words). I expect next week to get just as exciting as last week, might go down again, might go up again. It's gonna be entertaining and i love it. 
And nobody forgot about the big gains, they've been in the news alll the time for almost all of last year. So why should the coverage suddenly stop?

Well at this point it's all speculation. My evaluation of last week and this weekend isn't positive. 
Bitcoin started to rise after not getting banned in the US. To be honest I don't think that is good news but apparently lots of people got the confidence to buy at 6k. After that fomo helped push a bit.
Over the last few weeks Bitcoin was always strong over the weekends. I expected gains over the weekend, but when I look over the charts it seems like there isn't enough support at 8k and I expect prices to drop during the week.
That's just me speculating. And since I am not rich my prediction is usually wrong.

i think people confuse the usefulness of the technology with the usefulness of bitcoin. I'd be surprised if bitcoin is the future but i am pretty sure that the technology is very interesting. And you can use bitcoins technology without adding any value to bitcoin. That's the problem i see with many ICOs too. They might have great technology but it doesn't have to use or rely on the coin they give out.

Well it's a currency based on deflation. That means people with a lot of bitcoin win. So an interesting work would probably be about the driving forces in an economy that doesn't give enough incentive for investing and working. I mean you'll probably work for a while, but since the value of the money goes up your wage has to go down while the money on your bank becomes more and more valuable. To be honest i wonder for a while now how this could be a good system. seems problematic to me.
But other than that the reality is that bitcoin won't be a currency. It doesn't help anyone that doesn't make money on speculating with it. Some people say poor / instable countries benefit, but you have to be real those aren't the countries with a great IT infrastructure. The butcher in a little village in a third world country won't give you meat for half of an usb stick with a bitcoin wallet key on it.
A good stable regulated currency with slight inflation is probably rather good choice and seems to work just well.

well they probably don't want to invest into the infrastructure. Kinda understandable if you think that either cryptocurrencies will fail and make your infrastructure useless with nobody to pay for it or you think technological changes will solve the bitcoin energy problem. Either way you'll stand there with more powerplants than you need, which kinda sucks in any long term plan.

do i value magical internet money over magical real world products? To be honest i think both are overpriced and mostly used by clueless people. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 13:12:11
what you call too amazing is what other people call fatal flaws and problems. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:15:02
Might be, probably isn't, might be fixable, probably won't be. After all the people owning all those power hungry machinery are in control of the system.

decentralizing sounds great until you figure out how much it costs to connect two continents with a deep sea cable.

Remember the time governments had to pay for all the banks after they speculated with money they didn't have and suddenly the housing bubble popped? Yeah, if banks fuck up again governments will probably end banks. So banks try to not get dragged into another speculation bubble to make sure they still exist in a few years. And governments make sure that they don't have to pay for such a shit show again. 
You losing money you had, no problem. Banks won't stop you and the government won't stop you. buy bitcoins - but not with a credit card. A few million people losing tons of money they don't have might end really bad, So i am kinda glad that governments stop that. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:25:55
So they want to make a specialized chip to mine bitcoins to replace a specialized chip to mine bitcoin? I don't see anything that could go wrong with that.

oh sorry, back at university i got really drunk one night and started a discussion with a philosophy student. Didn't get anywhere promised myself i'll never do that again. So good luck with your philosopher friends, i guess someone have to give even the uneducated philosophers a job. Keep on doing the good work.
@_date: 2018-04-06 08:46:03
And crash with the g20 regulations in July?
@_date: 2018-04-05 08:44:09
* cash works without banks (,internet and power)
* they're backed by the government and very regulated to make sure that doesn't happen (again)
* governments will just bail them out if they stop working
pretty sure governments will just watch bitcoin burn. That's probably why they put out heavy warnings, just to be able to say we told you don't go there! We won't fix that for you.
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:38:55
I guess they're in order you just don't know which position is missing. I'd say that reduces it to 24 possibilities which isn't too big of a increase in difficulty. Should be doable rather fast. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:40:27
not having a credit card doesn't prevent you from buying things on amazon. I didn't have one for years and never had any problems using just my bank account. 
And i have to agree with the first comment, why add a middleman that takes more money than necessary? Pay more just to make sure i have used bitcoin? I'd rather keep my lambo catcher. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:47:53
well then tell me who is, to be honest i'd like to see some good people mentioned more often. But at the moment the most likable person i read about in bitcoin news is Mark Karpelès... which is really frustrating.
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:46:28
do i really have to get out my ruler to draw a few lines and explain to you the difference between a downward slope and an upward slope? Try to talk it away all you want, the downward slope is going on for 4 month and there's no sign of it stopping any time soon.
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:26:42
well, since we're on the internet i can privately tell you that i got a phd in bitcoin so i know what i am talking about. 
And if you go into bitcoin for it's nice money transferring properties you might be right it's not a pyramid scheme, if you're in for it as a store of value my logic doesn't apply. If you invest in it because you think it will give you a good return it only works as a pyramid scheme it will only go up when more people and more money joins the market. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:36:40
When you don't even know what's inside the links you post...
you should check your own post again -&gt;
your like my students they forget everything they knew 5 minutes ago and complain afterwards that nobody told them how it works. At this point i don't even know why i even bother trying. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 08:35:59
where's that guy that always yells "Governments can't control or kill crypto!"? He probably knows what to do.
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:58:26
that's only about 10k? seems completly off. If i'd plan to make an exchange i'd probably set my expectations a lot higher and i'd say you should probably be able to hire 2-3 web developers. Which i would say should cost you about 300k a year.
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:58:27
i hate betting against things, feels bad. I don't really want anything to fail and the only reason i am so critical about bitcoin is that at the moment it looks very much like a pyramid scheme. First adopters get rich, people who get in later are fucked. 
In general i try to put my money in companies that do or make something that i really enjoy: my search engine, my car, my mp3 player, my shampoo, my shoes, my icecream, etc. Supporting companies i like just feels a lot better then betting against anything. Was thinking about betting on bitcoin in November, glad i didn't. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:16:06
you can always make money you just have to be smart about it. Bitcoin is a money redistributing scheme, some gain some lose.
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:24:32
it did reverse big time from slowly climbing up to losing everything it gained over the last few days? Or do you mean it might reverse twice in 24 hours and jump right up again?
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:18:49
after i spend so much time on education and solving problems literally nobody else understands as well as i do and most people don't even have the mathematical background to even get close to them you tell me the most qualified shouldn't get an advantage? Thank god my employer thinks engineers actually do something reasonable with their time. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 08:51:42
well you can try to go to the government, but in general the police isn't well suited to deal with "new technology" problems. So they might take your information and put in a folder that's labeled "things we don't know how to deal with".
But yeah, the paradox relation doesn't just stop there. The exchanges, there's centralized sites that people use to check on which wallets are secure and save to use, centralized sites that help them keep tracking all the different crypto coins. The most important crypto services at the moment make crypto more centralized and accessible for the common person who doesn't have a clue what decentralization even means. 
Decentralization is just to complicated to deal with for us humans, we like to have a place to go with a certain problem. Decentralization is against our nature, the different possibilities will just give people anxiety and fear of choosing the wrong thing. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:07:44
yeah, but if you look at the volume you'll see that the vast majority of people bought after September. So yeah i'd say for a ton of people the disaster already happened, to be honest it got a bit more boring here lately. Everything in bitcoin seems to go down even the amount of posts here so i don't get the amount of blind believers that want to make bitcoin a religion and mooners who try to stay positive even though they lost half or more of their money (or money they thought they had). 
There's the people who want to change the world and then there's people who want to change their world. And in this subs there's clearly so many of the second kind that i feel a bit sad for the old members of this subreddit 2 years ago this was probably a really great sub, filled with people who had a fun time with their nerdy plan to improve the world. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:54:41
And become dependent on some japanese dude, winkelhoff twins and mcafee! yay... bitcoin really needs some more likable and respectable faces.
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:54:38
and now tell me how many cryptocurrencies failed over the last 6 month.
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:51:16
well i think the most qualified should get an advantage in arguments, but i am not sure how to convince you that i actually have my phd in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:16:35
i think you overestimate the age of our current financial system. And your link is 4 month old so everything about "value" and "richer" in the post is probably way off. And even the countries that support crypto is strange, it says Germany. I am from Germany and our government doesn't support it at all, it just doesn't do anything to make it harder for crypto and treats it like everything else. But not making something illegal or add special taxes isn't support in my book and we'll probably only know more after the g20 regulations in july. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:31:28
all your graphs stop at the best year bitcoin ever had... just wait for 18 and 19 and see those graphs again. Volume is down, Price is down, the number of new subscribers here is down. And yeah even on here almost half of the people most likely lost money and even more if bitcoin drops another 1k, which i predict to happen in the next 1-2 weeks if the 6.5k support breaks we'll probably see the 5 again. 
And people who hold just to not "realize their losses" will have to realize their loses at some point. College funds? Retirement money? Saved for a new car? Not many people are rich enough to just not realize their losses until they die. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:35:42
if history teaches us anything then probably not. First tries usually contain big flaws that only become obvious later and get replaced by something slightly different, new and better. Could be that there's a fix for everything that will hit bitcoin, but at some point it's like keeping a car together with tape. It might work but it's definitely not beautiful. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:18:34
I actually try to think about myself as actively trying to prevent others from making a mistake by posting very critical. 
Me being here and posting very honestly is like me standing next to a very slippery floor telling people that it is very slippery but i will still laugh when they fall (unless they fall really really hard), but at the same time i'll give anyone who makes it through an impressed nod.
To be honest when i red about the first bitcoin suicides i wasn't happy, i was very sad that some young guy killed himself because of something stupid like losing some money on bitcoin. But everyone who just came here to get a lambo and leaves with an dirty old bike i will happily laugh at.
