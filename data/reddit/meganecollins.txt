Not possible, blatant.  This is to encourage people to buy on other exchanges to arbitrage and increase the overall price.  
GDAX needs to let trading go live!  Make these people placing the buy orders pay for their manipulation.

This is price manipulation.

You got to think that there are a lot of people with a distaste for BCH and what it represents that will dump.  And a lot of people who dump Bcash will use it to buy Bitcoin.
The demand for Bitcoin tomorrow should be above average and I assume this will help the price.

One word: manipulation.
Someone is trying to show a fake arbitrage opportunity to get people to buy up BCH.  But this trade can not be executed right now.  As soon as trading starts this will be gone.  All the other liquidity is at 0.2 instead of 3.

This is likely to lead to regulation... I say let it be.  
Bitcoin needs to be resistant to attacks.  It was attacked today.  But if you held you were fine, and if you get scared you might end up with a bag.  At some point it is also on the users.

GDAX is down for most users, and the price shown for BCH is FALSE.  Until they start allowing trading do not assume you can arbitrage for that price, and do not assume that order book has anything to do with what the price of Bitcoin of BCash (now calling it that after this attack) will be after this pump.
I am salivating to log in and buy below 16500.  Everyone knew GDAX was adding BCH support, this price change is pure manipulation.
