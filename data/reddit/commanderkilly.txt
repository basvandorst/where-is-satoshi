It wasn't a joke!  I just got crazy upset when my wallet.dat said it was corrupt/not working, etc.  As stated, looking into other solutions now.  Thanks for your thoughts.

Context: Bitcoin-qt encrypts wallet.dat files in such a way that if you transfer bitcoins away from them, they actually change.  You can no longer use the "original" wallet.dat that you might have in cold storage after this.
Scary lesson to learn with this much money.
EDIT: This was a misunderstanding on my part.  I had loaded a different wallet into my bitcoin-qt client, which did something to corrupt my other wallet when I put it back in.  I got it working just fine again once I downloaded the blockchain on a different machine and simply loaded up my wallet that way.

My understanding is that encrypted wallets specifically are different with bitcoin-qt.  It randomizes these addresses each and every transaction, and I failed to save the wallet.dat after that last transaction was done.

Your post helped me most in particular, as you were spot-on.
I thought this was how it worked, but given the nature of drugs, my thinking hasn't been nearly sane enough over the last few years.  Please give me an address so I can at least give you a tip for your trouble in aiding my perseverance (unless no tip is desired).

Wow.  Thank you.  Holy crap.  Both you and ksmathers (whom I recognize from somewhere...hmmmm) have helped me immensely.  I will be switching everything up tomorrow and educating myself much more about my wallet options.

You are absolutely correct, please see edited post.  :)  Thanks so much for stopping by and helping though!!  &lt;3

Let's just say years of weed has had a tremendous effect on my learning and memory...and on natural states of paranoia, as well (obviously).  How embarrassing.
&lt;3 thank you for the kind words, stranger.
