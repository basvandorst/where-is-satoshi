I do realize that. Of course, nanoBTC will be necessary in the 3rd world so that people can think of their currency in whole numbers. But......the point of my post is that 3rd world adoption will come last---Andreas Antonopolous is saying that the 3rd world will come first.  If 3rd world adoption comes last because of security issues/technical requirements, then the gap between a rich 1st world and a poor 3rd world grows bigger. 
And with money comes power, and the 1st world will gain more control over the 3rd world. Power means exploitation. That result runs counter to the idea that BTC is neutral and empowering to everyone.

I think BTC is a great idea...I just wonder whether it widens the wealth gap between the 1st and 3rd worlds. Great technologies sometimes have unintended effects. The internet was a great thing, too, but it's a fact that many of the poor in the USA have less access to the internet than the rich do, and therefore, less information and news on which to base decisions.
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:13:01
The point is that government activity is driving the evolution of digital currency.

The lowest price after the Gox crash was like 540 at Coinbase...so 620 (today's price) isn't much different. Looks like Bitcoin is very resistent to bad news.

Sorry to be so ignorant, but....How does the BItcard work?
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:15:47
Yes, when BTC makes it to the 3rd world, it will have advantages there, regardless of the price.
The question in my mind, though, is: How much more richers is the 1st world now, and how much more power does it have, simply because BTC made it to the 3rd world last.

I have heard of Linux...but my friends in the PHilippines have never used it. I have never used it. It would be great, though, if the rise of BTC lead to the rise of Linux, and if that helped kill WIndows. :)

Can't they just analyze the blockchain and then watch the addresses to which the stolen money went and try to identify them? They could further watch any addresses that receive money from the stolen addresses, and eventually some of those could be identified. At some point, someone down the line will be identified in the physical world, and they can identify who they dealt with, and so on, back up the chain...it's not an impossible problems. Computers are good at doing things like this...that's why we have miners!
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:57:14
If the point of BTC is not to make money, but to enjoy a payment system, then why sell BTC at all?
I disagree that ordinary people can use an online wallet in the 3rd world. Maybe they can most of the time...but how often do you get ripped off? Most of the population in the Philippines uses an internet cafe. They don't have enough money to own their own computer. If you want a virus...put your USB into a computer in an internet cafe. There are no secure browsers...anywhere. As soon as you use a browser, you're exposing yourself to malware.

@_date: 2014-03-02 22:03:09
That's a strong reaction. "priced out of the market" was probably a poor choice of words, since there will always be a market, since BTC can be fractionated. However, that doesn't mean BTC doesn't widen the difference between the wealth of the 1st and 3rd worlds.

Let's hope those Android phones are the latest versions, not ice cream sandwich...malware on Android phones is a huge issue, too. 
They can afford free software, if they have the resources to download it. But most of what they install is pirated, in my experience.

Definitely prefer asking to IRS audits and enforcement fines. Turns out that in missouri you need a $100,000 line of credit. In Florida you need to make quarterly reports to the state. Barriers of entry are steep.

Now that Bitstamp has been notified, it has legal obligations. In the USA, at least (I know Bitstamp is Europe), there are laws against receiving stolen property. Property which is believed to be stolen must be reported to law enforcement. Profiting from property which is even suspected to be stolen is a crime. This means that if Bitstamp fails to act, then (depending on EEC laws), there could be substantial fines.
@_date: 2014-03-16 02:28:36
That's interesting. Thanks for the history lesson!
@_date: 2014-03-18 13:21:56
Andreas Antonopoulous is part of Blockchain.info. He's one of the sharpest people in the whole Bitcoin adventure and an accomplished public speaker. So it's a really crazy idea that they'd ever try to steal Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:53:15
Nah, the protocol will be changed, or some method introduced, to make it even more untraceable. This is just a temporary setback. Right now there are crypto-nerds out there coding up this very thing...if not for bitcoin, then for some other currency.
@_date: 2014-03-26 14:43:34
They sure do...its disgusting seeing Gox there.

I figure the safety deposit box is less prone to thieves than my house!
@_date: 2014-03-29 17:44:33
YOu're right, it isn't...because currency the Fed has to go through the banking system in order to affect the money supply. This would cut out the middleman.
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:13:57
I'm not saying that price affect accessibility. But accessibility does affect price. Presumably, more demand = higher price. The 3rd world might be poor, but when you consider all of the third world together, suddenly that's a lot of demand. Assuming the security was there, those third world economies could ignite. That's more demand for BTC = higher price. 
But if the 1st world gets BTC first, and the 3rd world gets it last, then the price of BTC has already experienced a run up, and the difference in wealth between 1st and 3rd world is increased.
@_date: 2014-03-12 02:02:25
Good for you. This is what Bitcoin needs. Overt preference of Bitcoin over the dollar. :)
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:16:34
That could be a good thing for us. I still need to purchase. :)
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:41:12
Yes, I edited my post to make that clear, thanks.
@_date: 2014-03-02 20:04:17
This is a good point about India...let's hope those programmers solve the security problems.
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:03:20
I do realize this, yes.
@_date: 2014-03-24 01:55:59
Great!  But how do you get the data for the charts? You can to get that from the blockchain somehow, yes?
@_date: 2014-03-29 12:02:01
I supposed banks could simply clone Bitcoin or Litecoin or one of the other digital currencies which has favorable properties. They could establish an astronomical amount of currency, say, 100 trillon...they would simply say that their currency was intended to mimic the real world, and so, that this large number parallels the unlimited amount of fiat currency that can be printed. Should the economy require it, they would then inject currency into the money supply by sending some amount to every registered public key. Large banks would run their own hashing farms in order to keep the block chain moving, and to avoid 51% attacks or mining pools.
Such a currency could even be 100% pre-mined. You would simply exchange dollars to "bankcoins" on a 1 to 1 basis. $1 = 1 bankcoin. Banks would then say that you get all the network goodness of Bitcoin without wasted electricity, without excessive volatility, and backed by the full faith and credit of the US government (not saying this is good, just saying this is how they could sell it).
@_date: 2014-03-16 02:14:05
Not sure why the hostility...I was just asking a question.
@_date: 2014-03-15 22:58:14
You said, "Miners and early adopters(interchangeable) therefore have a huge incentive to increase the liquidity pool where they can sell their bitcoins into. This is what is driving them to promote "adoption", setup exchanges and make it easier for liquidity to enter bitcoin."
THis sounds good to me. At some point, Bitcoin has to go mainstream, and it's not gong to happen without a major major push. Whether that push is part of Satoshi's agenda or not, the fact that it exists is great. Early adopters make most of the money, of course, but why not...those who get in now will still make a ton of money.

@_date: 2014-03-01 00:41:15
In my opinion, other currencies like Litecoin will start chipping away at Bitcoin's worth. Eventually, other digital currencies will be accepted and functionally identical to Bitcoin. The technology of other digital currencies will catch up...Why pay more for something that's different only in name?
@_date: 2014-03-11 06:06:39
Yeah, good point...who knows what other bugs could lurk deep in that library, or other libraries. Who knows what bugs hackers already know about, but have not "used" yet...

Wow, had not thought about the printer. Thanks for bringing this up.

Great security post. THANK YOU!

I think these Japanese taxes suggest that governments could tax digital currency until it's no longer very attractive. Once governments learn that digital currencies are set for massive gains in value, they'll want their share, without any risk. Taxes could do that.
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:51:12
Because this leads to a currency which is more anonymous and secure.
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:06:21
I wasn't really on a crusade, and wasn't trying to lay a guilt trip. Sorry if it came across that way. My point was really that widening the gap between 1st and 3rd worlds is probably an unintended effect of BTC, in combination with lack of security associated with windows, browsers, and so on. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 03:01:31
Please, tell me how.
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:33:17
It's a bad idea to encode any additional information in the blockchain. This is makes it possible for governments to pass laws saying that transactions cannot be processed unless someone's real name and contact information (or a pointer to such) are in the block chain.
@_date: 2014-03-02 20:01:24
Imagine that people in the developing world were able to buy BTC at $1 per BTC a few years ago (or whenever). Now it's $600 per BTC. $1 now buys 1/600 of the BTC it did a few years ago. Early adopters get rich, and the 3rd world can't adopt early, because the barriers are too high.
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:29:55
Could be that this Satoshi is not the real one, but had heard about the real one and bought some Bitcoin at one time. Now he's getting grilled, and just wanted to absolve himself of it. Maybe he doesn't want Bitcoin pinned on him and regretted that he ever tried owning any of it. So the whole thing really is circumstantial. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:49:00
This is BS, the IRS has just killed itself. Do you really believe that people are going to do this? No. Bitcoin tumblers will become easier and easier to access. The IRS has just given momentum to the underground economy that will someday destroy it. Nothing more.

Thanks for the explanation, I really appreciate that. I'm picking up bits and pieces slowly from different people. 
The weak link in this chain is the USB stick, right? Cause the USB stick could carry Malware. If I was creating Bitcoin malware, I'd make sure it could load itself onto USB sticks. That's one theory on how Stuxnix got to the Iran centrifuges.

By the way, just so you know, I'm not anti-Bitcoin...I'm pro-BTC. :)
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:38:43
What this really means:  People don't want to pay taxes, so mechanisms spring up which makes Bitcoin untraceable. Which means that the IRS has just given momentum to an underground economy which will one day destroy it.
@_date: 2014-03-24 00:13:16
People have to demand it...that's the only way it's going to happen. People who were Goxed in Europe have to join together and contact the appropropriate regulators, who can then descend on Bitstamp with a request for accountability.
@_date: 2014-03-24 17:35:26
You would certainly think that buying and selling a currency would be freedom of expression...the statement being, "I don't want USD anymore, I want Bitcoin."
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:21:19
it is very slick, but what happens when Facebook adds a field for your bitcoin address?
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:16:43
But eventually you'll be able to do everything with Litecoin that you can do with Bitcoin... Not now, but eventually. WHat is it that I really want to do? Mostly it's limited to going out to dinner and seeing a movie, fun things. Or buy something at a store. That kind of thing will open up for Litecoin. 
And when it does, then a Bitcoin is just a $600 dollar bill, and a Litecoin is just a $10 dollar bill. Of course, those numbers are fluctuating, but when Litecoin and Bitcoin have the same "market penetration" they're functionally the same currency.
 
@_date: 2014-03-24 22:16:26
Not to mention the fact that sales of stolen bitcoin push the price down. Multiple threads have mentioned how Gox thieves might be selling slowly in order to claim their money, thus artificially depressing the price of bitcoin.
