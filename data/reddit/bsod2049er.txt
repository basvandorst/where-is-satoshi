This is very handy for the store because your response to this problem is to buy way more than you need, just to be on the safe side.

This reminds me of a destitute man buying lottery tickets.
"It's a waste of money," they'll say. "You should spend it on rent, food and clothing. You already owe the landlord and you'll be evicted if you don't start saving up to pay him."
He keeps buying lottery tickets in spite of his friends' advice. He then goes on to win the Powerball and who's laughing now!

Top Gear got out of the resulting lawsuit because they *are not* a car review show but a comedy show. Comedy shows have no obligation to tell the truth so although Tesla was able to point to blatant lies about their car in the show it didn't matter.

You could use it to handle all the transactions in a very small town, or you could use it to handle all the global transactions of a very small subculture. That's all it's designed to do and the latter is what it's doing. It's working and being used exactly as designed which seem like a success to me.

Energy expenditure is a particular quirk of Bitcoins "proof of work" design characteristic. There are other designs that require much less energy, or even effectively no energy, to prove a node's commitment to the network.

If making it in music is skill based then the skill is sweet talking Hollywood moguls into letting you into their franchise. Sure you also need to be skilled at music but there's literally tens of thousands of those knocking on doors and there's only a few dozen multi million dollar music industry franchises to go around.

That is unfair to Bitcoin. For all of its fundamental flaws it has actually been used by a lot of people to conduct transactions. And considering it was inexplicably designed to not have any throughput capacity at all it is even *magnificently* successful because it's basically constantly working at 100% capacity. Bitcoin couldn't be any more successful than it already is because it wouldn't have the capacity to handle the additional transactions anyway.
