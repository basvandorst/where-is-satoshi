When you say gold is very popular, remember that people don't buy stuff with gold. Very few, if any, merchants, accept physical gold. If people bought stuff with either gold or bitcoin more frequently then prices would stabilize for both. The reason why gold is more stable than bitcoin is (I'm guessing) is there is more out there vs. bitcoin and there are more fiat-to-gold transactions. More gold miners mining gold and turning that to USD, etc.

I think the US Gov. has something up their sleeve, whether that be the ability to track who owns what wallet, etc (through the NSA) or some means to radically undermine public confidence in BTC. The Senate hearing on Bitcoin was giddy. Why would the US Government happily let Bitcoin erode their control? There's no way the US Gov. would be so giddy about a currency that let's people avoid taxes. There's simply no way!
