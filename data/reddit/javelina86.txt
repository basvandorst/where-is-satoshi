Thanks for the clarification. So now understanding this I'll change the question a bit. Given that each wallet has a seed phrase, can someone studying the blockchain determine that all of the addresses within that wallet are actually in one wallet belonging to one person (or company) or is that impossible?

Thanks for replying. Please see my question to grnqrtr above.

How are the Danes doing this?

After today's fiasco I'll be looking for another exchange. Any exchanges that seemed to be able to handle the traffic today preferably US dollar based?
@_date: 2016-11-15 05:00:26
OP has posted this three times today. I vote scam.

Thank you all for your answers.

Why would anyone invest 10 billion to hack Bitcoin? As soon as they do it the coins become worthless anyway!

Bitsquare and wall of coins both are great in theory but I'm finding almost no liquidity on either exchange. It's a pity.

Is this company legit? Seems way too good to be true.
@_date: 2016-11-10 04:31:16
I'm still a bit confused. If the block chain can identify the sub-accounts how can the sub-accounts also be anonymous?
@_date: 2016-12-23 22:29:26
I found the tool useful but one result puzzled me so I'm not sure what info it's using. For instance I plugged in the from address of a little over 2.0 bitcoins and the result mentioned 46 bitcoins. Do you know if that was the contents of the wallet owned by the sender? 
@_date: 2016-11-16 05:58:03
But see my post above.
@_date: 2016-12-23 22:30:32
Thanks. Looks promising.

On Coinbase is it possible to pick a particular lot to sell like you can with equities?
@_date: 2016-11-07 05:12:42
The word Bitcoin never came up

Another vote for Monero compatibility!

I've just decided I won't sell my one ounce gold coin for less than $50,000. Is everyone with me? OGEC!

I've had an offer to buy 1.0 btc on bitsquare for three days with cash deposit at a slight premium to market and it just sits there.

A coin dealer showed me a fake gold Eagle last year that passed a Fisch test!  Only when put right next to a real Eagle could you spot the difference which was a slightly different color and less crisp engraving.

For every seller there must be a buyer by definition.

The taxes and a mayor that belongs in clown school may prompt me to move  before bitcoin hassles become a serious problem.

Doesn't seem like this is written by an actual person. The language is very odd.

Would love to have one in south Spaha (East Harlem). I'm sure you'll find leasing space is far cheaper than Brooklyn and am seeing a lot of young folks moving in recently. Get in before rents pop.

Wait, you've been trading crypto for four years and this is your first Reddit post??!! Something is very fishy here. Let me guess, you're short tether and just opened this reddit account to FUD tether? You may be right, but please, let's not pretend you finally needed to speak out after four years. Ridiculous.

The description barely qualifies as English. Is this a scam?

Ledger Wallet works for me. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 12:04:41
Yes, under one seed phrase.
@_date: 2017-10-11 02:08:58
Thanks. Interesting project. Had never heard of it. If anyone has used it, would love to get some feedback positive or negative.
@_date: 2015-09-04 23:16:07
How does this prevent short sales? 
@_date: 2016-10-26 00:46:26
The best I can find on localbitcoins charges 7% for a $2,000+ transaction! Smaller buys are a lot more expensive. Seems nuts to me.

I've read that libertyx requires a sign-up with photo ID (and they get your cell phone # as well... bye bye anonymity). Not true?? 
@_date: 2016-10-26 00:54:02
From libertyx website:
We ask for basic ID verification information (e.g. the information off your drivers license). This includes name, address, and date of birth. We check these against public records to make sure you are a real person. If we are unable to confirm your identity you have the option of submitting a scan of your license or other verification document.

No, unfortunately I have not received the funds and it's now been roughly 72 hours.

Let's say I lived in New York which has very few localbitcoin traders with good trust ratings. (Perhaps the NY bitcoin license law has something to do with this?) By fees I simply meant the percentage added on to bitstamp price or similar that I'll be asked to pay to convert. One can go to one of the many bitcoin ATMs in NYC, but the fees are excessive to put it charitably.
@_date: 2015-11-12 06:00:42
Anyone actually ordered from these guys?

Why does the Mycelium app need access to my camera? DCentral popped up with this info when it was attempting to update.

Premiums are very high (typically 8-12%).
@_date: 2015-10-09 04:52:36
How is this different or superior to Coinbase exchange?  It seems virtually identical to me.
