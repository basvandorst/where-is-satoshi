Is SegWit our only option if we want to stick to peer to peer payments and low fees or are there other technologies due to come online in Bitcoin?
While I appreciate the technology behind LN, I’d prefer to stay fully decentralised.

Visa is no threat to PayPal at all really.  You can't simply ask for a seller for their "visa ID" and send them money direct like you can with PayPal or Bitcoin.
With Bitcoin multisig/escrow systems coming on line soon you could potentially be safer sending via Bitcoin than any other method too.  All without the banks all without being charged.

It was around April. I'd have to log into Bittylicious and check my account.There's no point in complaining now as it was sorted another way.  Its annoyed me a little as the feeling I had (as the OP will have had!) when I realised I'd sent money to the wrong person was horrible.

The annoying thing about the UK's Director ban is that it doesn't stop you from being a majority share holder in a Limited company.
What usually happens to serial scammers that are banned is they start a new business and get a current romantic partner to hold the Directors position,  but retain control and ownership of the business. 
After they have done this it's usually the partner that suffers as they are legally responsible for all the fraud the scammer commits.
I imagine this is exactly what this guy will do in a few years time,  and I'm actually surprised he didn't do it this time.

It's the same as regulating the use of the Sun. Telling the business owners of NY how long they can spend in it, what cream they must wear and how they treat people from outside of NY when dealing with them while standing in the sunshine.The Sun itself hasn't changed, and for the rest of the planet the regulations make no difference, but it can make things a little bit difficult for people in NY and people who do business with other businesses in NY.

The easiest place to buy Bitcoins in the UK is via bittylicious.com.
You do a bank transfer with a reference to an account number they give you for an agreed amount. Once the money goes into that account they send you the Bitcoins to the address you gave them at the start, in your case your Coinbase wallet address.
Usually takes less than ten minutes if you've got the faster payments facility on your account, but occasionally takes a few hours. The are other options for buying in cash but I've never used them.The site is very reputable and even if you've done something wrong the admins will usually do what they can to help you.

If you dump your private key for an address, does it remove that address from the wallet?I'd like to print off the private keys in my wallet to store with some legal documents, but I'd also like to keep the Bitcoins in my wallet should I decide to move them to an exchange to sell if the price goes up.

I did almost the exact same thing buying Bitcoins on Bittylicious.com, however, my mistake was within the traditional banking system.I used previously stored sort codes and account numbers because I didn't realise they could change each time you bought from Bittylicious (despite it saying in a huge red box on the screen).I phoned the bank and asked if they could reverse the payment and they said they couldn't, I'd have to contact the person I sent it to and get them to send it back. When I said I didn't know the person they basically said the money was gone and I'd authorised it.Fortunately for me I contacted the admins at Bittylicious and they traced the account holder I'd sent it to and sent me the Bitcoins I'd paid for.So for anyone thinking this is a flaw with Bitcoin, the exact same flaw exist with the banking system now. You send money to a valid address or sort code &amp; account number, your money has gone.Edit: Grammar.

Well, in this case I'll name and shame the bank! Barclays bank and I spoke to two different reps on the phone in UK call centres.I was told on both occasions that because I'd sent the money (signed it using PIN sentry etc) it couldn't have been a mistake and thus it was my fault and I'd have to contact the person I'd sent it to.Wasn't there some change in the banking rules to say of you use your PIN all liability falls on the customer? Could that be why?Edit: Looks like new rules are on the way in:My mistake was before this, maybe if I'd complained in a branch I'd have got further, but I didn't need to go that far thanks to the admins.

So even if for some reason Bitcoin didn't take off as a currency, but the protocol was still used by payment processors, it would still be worthwhile to keep a few BTC handy as the payment processors would likely want to buy them?

Can you elaborate on the multisig please?Escrow seems to be a step backwards. I can't see a benefit of bitcoin and escrow over traditional fiat and visa/mastercard processing.Thanks for the reply.

Bitcoin was created as a peer to peer electronic currency, something that you could use to pay for your coffee or but a house with. The current Core dev team are moving Bitcoin towards a settlement system.
@_date: 2016-03-01 07:24:34
By current system, do you mean traditional banking?
If so, then no not for everything. I can move money between different bank accounts, including different banks in seconds using Faster Payments, which is 100% free.
However, Bitcoin is still faster and cheaper (for the next week or so at least!) than international SWIFT or IBAN transfers, something that I personally do once every two or three years.

Hopefully, because Antpool add a lot of hash power to the network, and mining empty blocks is a healthy thing to do for mining hardware.  Its good to see miners take care of their farms.

Saying code should be delayed for a year+ is meaningless. You can only make a guess at the length of time it would take to test and fix code once you've been through testing and corrected bugs with the whole process logged on something like a burn down chart.
It might be a week, it might be three years. At the moment you have absolutely no idea so pulling a timeline out of the air can only be to fulfil a narrative.

I totally agree that the block size can't be increased forever, but...
The things that's stupid about the whole situation is, the block size needed to be increased no matter what!
Even with SegWit and LN the block size needed to be increased for settlement to be possible *if Bitcoin achieves any significant adoption.*
@_date: 2017-08-10 11:58:50
You are incorrect.
Emtpy blocks are mined in between blocks while downloading, validating and defining a new block to mine on.  The hardware would go from 100% to 0% without mining empty blocks.
If you would like to correct me. Please cite resources.

Thank you for the reply &gt; Those things are now so fast an empty block makes virtually no difference.
Well if that's the case, I am sure we could increase the block size a smidge ;-)  (that was typed with my tongue in my cheek, and I don't want to discuss this, its been done to death).


I agree, they could keep mining the old work.  However, the probability of mining an empty block is higher, the system allows you to do this, and every other mining pool does this - why would you NOT do this?  The miners are not doing this for free.  They are doing this to make money, and the users are taking advantage of this.
I don't have a problem with a system that prevents the mining empty blocks being release, but what isn't really fair is demonizing the people who secure the networking for using the rules of the network.
If you are ever in the UK, ping me and I'd love to meet up for a drink and some food to discuss things like this and learn from people who know much more than me!

Here's some articles on mining empty blocks:
From that article:
"When a mining pool receives a new block from a competitor, it needs to perform a few actions: download the full block, validate its transactions and define a new block to mine on. During this - albeit short -interval, so as not to waste hashing power, they start mining a new block."
And a few more:
If you don't want to read them, they all agree that the mining empty blocks does not detract from the miner mining blocks with transactions. 
Finally, here's an article from KnC miner
"After all, finding an old block is 100% useless. BUT stopping the chips so hard and fast is like pulling the plug out of a working computer. You will end up with a higher hardware failure rate and trip a lot of fuses. So you can’t simply STOP working on the old block and wait for the new one"
Stating that it lowers hardware failure rate.
I hope you enjoy my resources, however I imagine they will be moderated to a point where you can't read them.

Economics aside - I acknowledge that the price of the coin  has plummeted, and that someone has taken advantage of the transaction malleability - the same malleability that exists in BTC until Segwit goes live, I am not 100% sure what research is needed.
The hard fork has been successful.  Additionally there seems to be no problems with larger blocks - seeing the mempool clear on BCH is fantastic.
The only thing that would be useful is some sort of data modelling on the three scenarios:
Scenario 1) 8MB blocks
Scenario 2) Segwit
Scenario 3) Segwit2x
Forecast transaction growth based on past performance, in absence of a better way of doing this.
However I think the community is far beyond this and I imagine that even this open minded comment will get downvoted...

Why did Satoshi add a block size limit?

This is absolutely false information. 
As of the latest release of Ethereum client and Geth, the Ether blockchain syncs faster than the Bitcoin blockchain, given the same hardware and network. 
However in my personal experience, there had been a problem syncing for around a year prior to that when only high end hardware could sync in any decent amount of time. During this period it was much easier to sync Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:17:20
I was going to start some tests myself, but Peter has just made a post on about this:
Light sync takes 39 seconds (this doesn't download the blockchain)
Fast sync takes ~3 hours (this downloads the full blockchain but only validates last 1024 blocks, )
I haven't performed a full sync, which validates every block in addition to downloading the full blockchain.
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:39:19
When did you last try? I’ll be the first to admit that I, and other colleagues, were unable to sync the Ethereum blockchain last summer. 
In the last three weeks I’ve synced both Bitcoin and Ethereum on the same machine, and i5, 32GB with a 2TB SSHD using a 40Mbit connection running Linux and Ethereum was faster.  This was without —warp too. 
I’m tempted to deleted them both and time them to show the results.

I bought 60BTC for £43 and left them on my work computer when I changed jobs. I believe the machine was sent to be recycled and probably ended up in an ex-corporate eBay sale.
Didn't really bother me because it wasn't much at the time.  It still doesn't really bother me because I would have sold them long before they were worth what they are today. I probably would have sold them the minute they hit £100.
Still, it's a good story to tell and just shows that you might get lucky!

I'm a large blocker, but I'd like to say I really do hope you create a new coin.
You have some interesting (and sometimes extreme) opinions on how things could be done and you are a talented programmer. I'm not convinced that the coin will become mainstream like Ether or Bitcoin, but I can imagine a scenario where it has a large user base and is watched by the whole crypto community for how changes pan out technically and I can imagine it influencing the whole crypto-sphere in a positive way.
However, starting using the Bitcoin Ledger as a base is asking for trouble. The coin will get dumped so hard and you would essentially be giving people a tool to grief you.
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:23:40
This ^^ guy gets it.
The miners and a large part of the community are firing Core and using another dev team to supply the reference implementation, for at least the next version of Bitcoin.
Core can pretty much take it back just by merging Segwit2x in, but it's showed them they are not in control. Everyone is.

I'd say when it costs $5 to move $1 within the first block.
So last Month ;-)
I've got an old wallet with less than $40 in it. It's been used lots for purchases and contains lots small amounts. I simply can't use it at the moment without loosing most of the money.
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:45:21
Check the details.
It uses a different signaling method to SegWit. If SegWit2x activates the hard fork is already locked in.
