This should be emphasized.  I can get prescriptions written at free/cheap clinics (in the US), but I buy my meds online through a Canadian pharmacy, because that's the only way I can afford them.  It is legal if you have a copy of the prescription accompanying the meds.
I used to go through a Canadian clinic online that would actually write the prescription for me.  That was even better (it's just routine asthma maintenance meds I've been on forever), but that particular pharmacy shut down.

No.  This is actually old news.  And the "spy" nodes are just nodes that are (basically) trying to link bitcoin address to IP addresses - in an attempt to make bitcoin a little less anonymous.
Technical users can circumvent the spy nodes trivially, and non-technical users shouldn't be assuming bitcoin is truly anonymous anyway.  Everything is okay.

I was skeptical of this at first, but I just worked out some basic probabilities on the ol' chalk board.  There is something to it, and I can see where they are coming from.  The problem with it actually working in reality is this:
They don't release their "secret" blocks until *after* they've seen the honest miners release their block.  In fact, this is how they know when to release their secret blocks... the broadcast of the "honest block" acts as a signal for the selfish miners to broadcast their block...
Why does this matter?  Because in order for selfish miners' fork to be accepted, they need (on average, and assuming the selfish miner's hold exactly 25% of the total hashing power of the network) to get at least one third of the honest miners to mine on their fork.
Now, if the honest block and the secret block were broadcast at the exact same time, then getting that one third would be easy.  However, since the honest block is being broadcast first, it gets a head start.  And every honest miner that sees the honest block first will mine on that fork.
I don't have the block-propagation-time data I would need to determine whether this would work irl.  I'm skeptical.
Tl;dr: The attack is possible theoretically, but not necessarily irl.  They should perform a proof-of-concept on a test net.

The blockchain is an original idea.  It solves the double-spend problem by allowing a trustless decentralized network to "timestamp" a transaction.  *That* had never been done before.
Yes, the cryptographic structures used (hashcash, etc) were not new.  But the structure he built from them was.
Saying it wasn't new is like saying to Turing "computers aren't new... they are really just a bunch of transistors and wires and those have already been invented."

Two points need to be made very clear to newcomers:
1) Bitcoin is NOT anonymous.  It was not designed with anonymity in mind.  It is not "an anonymous digital currency".  That's probably the biggest piece of misinformation people hear about bitcoin.
2) "Mining" is not a magical act, and it's certainly not "computers solving complex math problems" (unless you think "guess and check" billions of times per second is a "complex math problem", lol).  Mining is just processing transactions and time-stamping them.... which is much harder in trustless P2P systems then most people think.
tl;dr: Bitcoin is not anonymous.  Mining is transaction processing.  Make those things clear to newcomers.

It's true, you do need a prescription for this to be legal (speaking from experience here).  But if for some reason I can't get a prescription, it's nice to know I can take a "hail mary" from india if needed.

Fortunately I'm not at that point now... but the way things are going, I could see myself ending up in that situation at some point in the future.

I love GGB, and I think posting there is fun.  But what would be even more awesome is if people started using the bitcoin tip bot to start tipping the girls over at r/gonewild and the other subreddits.
This would bring some attention to bitcoin in those circles.
Also, there seems to be a misunderstanding around why the girls post at GGB and why the guys tip there.  Some people actually find it stimulating to "strip" for tips.  The money isn't the *point*.... the money is just a "spice".  It's not everyone's bag -- so to speak -- but it's fairly common. 
 
This is equally true for the tippers.  Many guys actually enjoy tipping even when they don't have to.  You can see this at strip clubs.  Many people tip when they don't have to, and many tip much more than is "custom".  There's a kink to it that -- again -- is not everyone's "thing"... but is still common.  Some guys actually like it.
I know I'm not going to change anyone's mind about GGB, but I just want to (hopefully) shed some light on the motivations of it's participants.  It's not about girls making money for flashing thier tits (well, yeah, some girls go there for that... but they don't last long).  It's just a certain kind of 'kink', that's all.

It's the spending I'm worried about.  I don't want to link addresses when I spend.  That could destroy their privacy unwittingly.  I'm assuming my customers don't know how to mix coins.  See "PART 2" in the post, that might explain my question better.

I'm not concerned much at all about government regulation.  FinCen decisions would (I suspect) have the largest impact... more so than any other gov't agency I can think of.  Everything I've read from fincen about bitcoin (just google:  site:.gov bitcoin) seems to indicate they're taking a level-headed approach to bitcoin.  I'm (literally) betting nothing more than AML and KYC regulations are coming our way.
I think gov't regulation (at least in the US) will actually help improve adoption of bitcoin, as many nanny-state chickens here in the US won't dip their toe in the water unless Uncle Sam tells them it's okay first.

I've gotten a small group of people interested at my university.  All it takes is one person with a contagious personality to get all fan-girl over bitcoin and it starts to take off.
But if you are really serious about this....
The first thing you should do (assuming you're on Facebook... like everyone else at your college) is go to WolframAlpha and run a Facebook Report on yourself.  Use this to identify the most influential people in your network.  These are the people on which your efforts will be best spent.  Target them.  It's probably best if they don't *know* they are being targeted.
Once you know who to target (so as to best make use of your time and effort) the best thing you can do is get them to own some bitcoins.  Giving them some coin is the quickest way.
Also, if you can find a place nearby that sells alcohol for BTC take them there.

The reward will be close enough to "gone" far before then.  99% of all bitcoins will be mined by 2031.  At that point the block reward will be about 0.78 BTC per block.  That's very little incentive by itself.  So we'll be able to see whether the transaction fees will be enough incentive or not much sooner than most people think.
The biggest problem people have is understanding just how fast 50/(2^n ) goes to zero.  It's pretty damn fast.

China thinks very, very long term.  As in "multiple generations into the future" kind of long term.  Here in the US "long term" means 5 to 10 years.  To the Chinese gov't, "Long term" means hundreds of years.
Any 51% attack would be short lived, and would cause more harm than good to any Chinese holding the currency.  As China is preparing to wash itself clean of USDs, I think it just wants to make sure that all of the other currency and money they are holding (including bitcoin) is secure.
tl;dr: it' is more likely they are protecting themselves *from* a 51% attack.

Agreed.  To think otherwise is to fall for the "security through obscurity" fallacy.
The good news is that double spends can be detected quickly.  And if you need more certainty you can use a payment processor to absorb the risk.
Moreover, if it becomes a problem, that will just create a demand for off-the-blockchain payment processing companies (like inputs.io, coinbase, etc).

By keeping the block reward constant we'd solve the miner's-incentive problem.  There would be no upper bound on the number of total coins  BUT since the ratio of newly-minted coins to total coins will shrink with each block, the rate-of-inflation would limit to zero.
So we could print coins (at a constant rate) and still have a rate-of-inflation that approaches zero. 
Not going to happen with the Bitcoin protocol, obviously, but for some future crypto currency I think it would be a real positive.  Solves the miner-incentive problem without causing any meaningful rate-of-inflation.

To answer your first question, I think the way it works is *you* query other bitcoin nodes and ask them "hey give me the longest chain you've got".  You look at all the chains you get in response, check their validity, and then choose the longest valid one.
@_date: 2013-11-03 23:18:46
"Anonymous means that you are not attaching your ID"
No, that's pseudonymous.  It's not the same thing.
The difference is subtle, but important from a security point of view.  It is mentioned in the white paper.  I'll try to give an illustration of the difference:
Say I make 1000 separate transactions using the same pseudonym (aka "bitcoin address").  If any ONE of those 1000 transactions can be linked to my real identity, then ALL of them can.  This is because everyone knows that all of those transactions were made by the same person.... they just don't know who that person is (until they can link one of those transactions to a real ID).
In an anonymous system, however, no one would even know that those 1000 transactions were made by the same individual.  So if one of them was linked to a real ID, they don't learn anything else.
Pseudonymous and anonymous are not the same.  The former is a weaker security notion than the latter.
Now, that being said, it is POSSIBLE for a tech-savvy user with a good understanding of OpSec to USE bitcoin anonymously.  But the protocol itself doesn't offer you anonymity by default... only pseudo-anonymity.
This is not important for MOST individuals... but for some individuals the difference is critical -- think human-rights activists in China, or online drug dealers in the US, or wealthy people trying to move their money out of Argentina.  All of these people tend to send or receive a large number of transactions and can suffer larger consequences depending on how many of those transactions can be linked to their real identities.
EDIT: Spelling &amp; Grammar
EDIT:  btw, I'm not saying that bitcoin not being anonymous is bad.  I think that being pseudonymous rather than anonymous has it's merits.  I just think we should be upfront about that to newcomers.

@_date: 2013-11-22 23:00:28
The halving of the block reward every 4 years produces some interesting results.
More than 90% of all bitcoins will be mined before 2021.
More than 99.2% of all bitcoins will be mined before the end of the year 2033.
The remaining 0.8% will take more than 100 years to mine.
The second-to-last bitcoin will be mined around the year 2102.
The "last full bitcoin" will take about 35 years to mine.
EDIT: More info... If the transaction costs / blocksize problem doesn't cause btc to die before the year 2040, then I think nothing will ever stop it.
Interesting stuff.

This is what I envision.  Every store has it's own easy to use bitcointip-like bot.  load the acct as you walk into the store, use the "tipbot" at checkout and anything remaining on the acct afterwords sent back to your usual wallet.
In fact, you wouldn't even need a different tip-bot for each store.  You could have a company, call it BitVISA, that acts as a global tip-bot.  You load your BitVISA account with coins, then at the Taret checkout line coins are transferred from your BitVISA acct to  Target.  No 0-conf problem then.
And you only need to use the tipbot/BitVISA service in 0-conf situations (checkout line kind of stuff).

I understand, and I am providing everything I can.  I have seen other reddit users post about how they have been screwed by the shared-send service in the past, and how customer support stopped contacting them.  After enough people on reddit start caring, "magically" the blockchain support staff start caring too, and the situation is usually quickly resolved after that.  I believe I am proving the same proof that prior users have.  You have to understand, I have nothing to gain by lying here.  I don't run an "alternative mixing service"  or anything like that.  I don't hate blockchain.info, and I could never gain or extort any btc from them by lying.

No, for this business I'd obey any court-order.  I'm not worried about that here.  I won't keep logs of customers' names or addresses (don't need to).  The only logs I'll keep are those pertaining to accounting -- so I can pay taxes.  I'm basically running it as a "cash business", but using bitcoin instead of cash.
Using an exchange as a mixing service is an interesting idea.  You might have a problem with your output coins being "tainted" with some of your input coins, but it provides such a huge measure of deniability that that shouldn't matter.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:24:18

@_date: 2013-10-18 21:09:00
That's the impossible part... by the very nature of the mixing service, only blockchain.info knows for sure that the address I provided above was the address they gave me.  The link between the shared-send address they provided and my destination address is known only to me and blockchain.info.  That's sort of the point.
I could provide my destination address to you and you could look it up and see that no deposit in the amount that should have shown up ever arrived... but then you'd still have to trust that my destination address and the shared-send address above were linked.
So, no, I cannot provide proof to anyone accept those who already know which addresses are connected via the shared-send service (namely blockchain.info).  It's the nature of the service.
I'm just posting this to let other users know about my experience as a customer, and hoping that blockchain.info will be more likely to look into my case if they know other people are paying attention to the outcome.
EDIT: tl;dr: What could I possibly provide as proof?
@_date: 2013-11-01 03:00:41
I predict:
-They'll recommend Know-your-customer regulation for all large merchants accepting bitcoin.
-They'll recommend against regulation that would slow or stop bitcoin adoption by the masses.
-After the hearing is over, the libertarian and privacy-loving bitcoin enthusiasts (like myself) with moan and groan, but the do-anything-for-bitcoin-to-be-more-widely-adopted crowd will be very happy.
-The price will rise after the details of the meeting are announced.
My reasons: It's the DHS's wetdream to have all the details of every financial transaction publicly available.  Almost everything they want is already available on the block chain.  Almost.  With "proper" regulation, linking real life identities to bitcoin addresses will be much easier.
Thus, the more people adopt and use bitcoin, the more their all-seeing-eye can see.
The vast majority of the population doesn't have the technical skills needed to keep their identity hidden.

I just want to be clear that the goods in question are totally legal to buy and sell freely without a license.  If I had a brick and mortar store they could come in and pay for them in cash and leave without having to show ID or leave their name.  I intend to pay all federal, state, and local taxes.  These goods aren't illegal in anyway, there is just a huge *social* stigma around them (akin to the kind of  stigma really kinky sex toys would have among a group of puritans, for example).
I'm just trying to find a way to sell to them online that will protect their privacy.  I'm not trying to skirt or bend any laws.
Since I'll be declaring my earnings on my taxes, and since I'm being upfront about how I'm getting the money, I know it doesn't break any AML laws.  And since I'm not in any way a money-services business, I won't need to collect any KYC information.

Good luck!  I think this is great.  I had the exact same thought when I got sued for unpaid medical bills.... not the gambling part... but the "if I put what little I have into bitcoin they can't take it from me" part.
They'll still start having your employer take money from your paychecks... but they can only take a certain percentage (forgot what it is).
If you can get paid under the table, do it.  I actually think you're fighting the good fight (mostly because I believe medical billing practices in the US are corrupt and dishonest as hell).
I got charged $300 for being brought 3 over-the-counter Ibuprofen.  Apparently they're worth $100 each in the hospital.  Makes me want to pay my $3000 medical bill by sending them 30 Ibuprofen in the mail and calling it even.  F**** those people.  Don't give 'em a dime!

@_date: 2013-10-30 16:27:19
Nope, Coinbase is fine.  A "paper wallet" is when you print out your private key on a piece of paper.... no copy of the private key is kept on any computer anywhere.  That way, to spend the bitcoins you have to transfer the private key to a computer.
kharri is just saying that if you use a paper wallet (and, say, keep the paper in a safe somewhere) then you will be less likely to panic-sell if/when prices take a dip.... you'll be less likely to panic sell because it's kind of a pain in the ass to dig into your safe, transfer the private key to a computer, then transfer the bitcoins to an exchange and then sell.
Whereas if you keep them in Coinbase, selling is as easy as clicking a few times with your mouse.
So basically he's saying a paper wallet is a way to protect yourself from... yourself.  :)
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:07:41

@_date: 2013-11-26 02:50:32
I think you are misunderstanding.  The idea of time-stamping is not new, and hashing something and posting the hash in a public place is not new.
The blockchain serves not just as the time-stamper, but also the public place in which the hash is posted.
Prior methods relied upon trusted third parties (or systems with 'distributed trust'), whereas the blockchain works in a purely trustless fashion.  
To see the key difference, see Massias' paper (the first paper you quoted above).  See paragraph two on page three.  You can find the paper here:[link](
Note that even the system proposed by Massias required that "Big Round Values" be published in, for example, a newspaper.  The point is that this would not work in a trustless system (where users cannot even trust the newspapers to publish the correct hashes).
The blockchain, by contrast, actually does work in a truless system.  For one to try to forge the "newspaper" (aka: blockchain) they'd have to control more than 51% of the network.
See the difference?  "Minimal trust requirements" vs "no trust requirements"?  That's what the blockchain brings that didn't exist before.
(Thanks for challenging my earlier statement... you sort of sent me on a frantic crypto-paper-reading-frenzy.  That's good for one's health, I'm sure).

The advantage you gain in dollar-cost averaging is not a higher expected value/payoff... the advantage you gain is in reducing your variance.  Think of it as a way to help mitigate a certain type of risk... namely the risk of "jumping in" at the exact wrong time.
You are thinking of it as disadvantage because, in your case, the price rose the entire time you were entering.  Had the price been decreasing the entire time you were entering, you would have thought of it as an advantage.
Bitcoin is deflationary, and (assuming adopticaon continues) we can expect the price to increase over time.  But as with anything, there are good days and bad days.  Good months and bad months.  Dollar cost averaging helps protect you if you are investing in one of the bad months.
Say it's early April of this year and you are just hearing about bitcoin.  You want in on the action.  You get 20k into the exchange and it clears on April 9th.  You jump all in.  By April 16th your ready to hang yourself.  On the other hand, if you started dollar cost averaging in on April 9th, and finished (say) on May 9th, you'll have paid an average price of perhaps $118 per coin, and you're sittin' pretty.
Dollar cost averaging into a volatile commodity is like easing your way into the ocean gradually.  Buying all in at once with large sums of money is like cliff diving from a 10 story rock face, doing a double backflip somersault, narrowly evading ragged edges, and smashing into the water at 100 mph.   Both will get you wet.  But the former is a bit less terrifying.

Sure.  I'll agree that it's not *fundamentally* different.  I think it was definitely a non-trivial difference.... but perhaps not *fundamental*.  I mean, yeah, it's not like he invented provable security or public key cryptography.
But I think we can both agree that it does actually solve an unsolved problem.  (And you would probably say -- correctly -- that the problem was all-but solved already).
I think we should lather him with praise, while at the same time recognize that he was, indeed, standing on the shoulders of giants.

That's one possibility.  Again, we're assuming John is a dunce.  I know more than one bitcoin user that only uses 1 address, because they think it's somehow less complicated that way.
In fact, some brick-and-mortar places that accept bitcoin do this (like one of those Subway chains stores that started accepting bitcoin).
Even if John isn't a dunce, there are still many ways of associating several addresses to an individual if even only *one* of his address is publicly known.  So if John posts one address online in a forum asking for tips, it is possible to associate *many* (sometimes all) of the addresses in his wallet to John.
Read about the "closure" of a bitcoin address here: 
(here the word "closure" isn't being used as in "closing an account", but in a way more akin to the closure of an open set in the study of topology). 
In short, if John posted AddressA online asking for tips, then we can be pretty sure that John owns all of the addresses in the closure of AddressA.  So if John pays from any of the addresses in the closure of AddressA, Eve will know.
EDIT: Spelling and grammar.

To your fourth question: it depends on how it's done.  Ideally "pruning" would amount to no more than lossless data compression.
There has also been a whitepaper published that would (supposedly) allow for a 'rolling blockchain' (aka a blockchain with a finite number of blocks... as new blocks are added old blocks are removed).  I've read the paper, but I have some unresolved questions about it (in particular how his "proof chain" doesn't simply become decoupled from his blockchain), but that's a little off-topic.

There are other methods available for non-smart phones.  Any phone that can send a text message can send BTC... but you'll have to trust a third party.... like coinbase for example.  Several online wallets allow their customers to send BTC via SMS, but it's a little wonky at present.  It's easiest if both the worker and John are using the same online wallet, as then the john can send a text message using only the workers username and the funds will be transferred.
If the John and the worker are NOT using the same online wallet, (and the John is using a dumb-phone) then the John will have to manually type in the worker's entire public address.... not exactly what I'd call "foreplay".
There is a protocol called "firstbits" that will require only the first ~7 digits of the address to be entered, and the BTC will end up going to the correct address, but this protocol is not yet widely in use .  However, I suspect it will be as BTC adoption spreads to Africa, where 'dumb-phones' are king.

Assuming this is for long-term investment, I would create several paper wallets (look up how to do this safely).  I recommend laminating or vacuum sealing your paper wallets.  With paper wallets, the biggest threat isn't theft... it's water and fire.   Especially water.
Then, I would dollar-cost-average your way into BTC.  That means NOT jumping in all at once in one day.  Buying in slowly over a period of, say, a month actually *protects you* from the volatility.  It also protects you from being front-run by any campbx traders that catch on to the fact that some guy is about to buy a ton of BTC.
So, use paper wallets (or at least offline wallets) to protect you from theft.  Use *multiple* paper/offline wallets to protect you from all-your-eggs-in-one-basket kind of mishaps.  And dollar-cost-average your way into BTC.  That's my 2BTC.

I really think you should tell them everything you told us in the original  post.  Paint them a picture.  Then offer to accept 20% less as payment if they pay in bitcoin.  That should make the idea more attractive to them -- worth the 'hassle' for sure.  You get your money immediately, and with so much less friction that the 20% decrease in pay will still leave you far better off than you are now.  In fact, in very real terms that you understand, you would experience what felt like a raise in pay.  That's a win-win if I've ever heard of one.

It's 2140 if you include all of the very tiny block rewards.  If you take 50/2^n  and continue to increase n, you'll see that the block reward will be less than one satoshi when n=34.  That block reward will happen 4 * n=4 * 33=132 years from when the first block was created (in 2009).  So the block reward will be less than one satoshi in the year 2009+132=2141.
That being said, you are mostly correct.  The second to last full bitcoin will be mined around the year 2040.  The last full bitcoin will take over 100 years to be mined.

So if double-spend detection is very likely within seconds, what does the cashier do when one is detected?
Perhaps the following SOP would be good:
(1) Inform the buyer that a double-spend has been detected.
(2) Get a "return address" from the buyer (simple as scanning a QR code).
(3) Tell the customer that the transaction has been cancelled.  If the original/valid transaction ends up getting confirmed (6 blocks deep) before the bad one, then the POS software will simply give the btc back to the customer (by sending it to the customer's return address provided in step 2).
(4) Give the customer the option of trying to pay for the item again and initiate a new transaction if they want to.

I mean this with the absolute upmost respect:
Unless the 5-year old has a basic understanding of common cryptographic notions (hash functions, hashcash, public key encryption, digital signatures, etc) there is no chance of understanding the whitepaper.  None at all.
And the common cryptographic notions are difficult to understand without a decent background in mathematics and computer science (algorithm analysis, complexity theory, discrete probabilities, formal security notions, non-injective functions, etc).
The protocol really is a "tour de force", as Mr. Gates has said.  As a mathematician and armchair cryptographer I can say in all honesty that the blockchain construction is nothing short of brilliant.  The technology behind it is very difficult to simplify into an ELI5 answer.  
But if I had time to sit down and type one out it would have the following format:
(1) Give short background on the kinds of problems that arise when trying to create a decentralized currency on a trustless network.
(2) Explain how all of those problems were solved... except for one (the double-spending problem).
(3) Explain why the double-spending problem can be solved if we could only find a way to time-stamp transactions on a trustless network.
(4) Explain that the blockchain (Satoshi's original construction) gives us a way to time-stamp transactions on a trustless network-- and thus solves the double-spend problem.
(5) The End.

No.  I'm responding to a question another commentor had.  In the forum they refer to "spy" nodes (as they call them)... nodes that just listen and don't do anything else.  Those aren't related to DoS (well, perhaps in some sense they are since merely having them connected to other nodes requires resources from the other nodes).
The DoS issue they are talking about in the forum, if I recall correctly, has been addressed in the most bitcoin-qt release.

A user, Paranoid Panda, commented something interesting at the bottom of your first link:
"Even if the server is honest, you still have to trust that the other (N-1) people participating in the room are not colluding against you. This is particularly true for laundering larger bitcoin amounts. Ie: If I'm a fed and I want to catch launderers, I'll go to a popular anontx server and start a public room for N users to gather and mix, say, 100 BTC. I fire up (N-1) instances of the anontx client and join the room I just created. When SilkRoadVendorCashoutKing (SRVCOK) joins the room as the Nth party, we perform the mix. Since there are N input/output pairs and I control (N-1) of them, I know exactly where SRVCOK's 100 BTCs were sent. Not only that, but SRVCOK *thinks* his money has been laundered successfully, setting him up for real bad day when he spends those coins.
Note that this is not a problem with the Zerocoin protocol."
It's interesting.  Seems like Pablo and Amir's implementation is good against passive attackers, but perhaps not against active ones.

If coinbase is growing too fast to keep up with customer service, they need to *stop accepting new customers* until they are ready and able to handle more new customers.
That's just the right decision to make -- for the customers they already have (who deserve fast turn-around time on their support tickets), for the new customers (who will just be turned off by coinbase and/or bitcoin if they don't get good/fast customer service) and for themselves (it only hurts their public image when tons of users aren't supported promptly).
I admire their good intentions.  But the road to many a company's failure is paved with good intentions.
tl;dr: Don't bite off more than you can chew.

As for the working girls, they don't need much in the way of technology.  All they need is internet access.  Any smartphone (yes, even an iPhone) will work if they do as follows:
-Create a BTC wallet at home (somewhere safe and where the Johns won't have access), and create an public address.  Print out the QR code for that address, and take it with you when you work.
-As usual, the John pays up front.  Show him/her the QR code.  He can pay the address however he wants (most likely with his smartphone wallet app).  The key here is that the worker can verify payment with any smartphone by visiting blockchain.info/address/[insert her public address here].  This can be done from any smartphone with internet access.
It's actually better if the worker doesn't have her wallet on her own smartphone, which can be stolen by a bad John.  In this way, the above method is actually safer for the worker.
It can be improved upon.  For example, if I were a John I wouldn't want to look up my girls' address on blockchain.info and see that it has received 8 other payments earlier today.  That would be a major turn-off.  To avoid this kind of thing, the worker can create several public addresses and print out their QR codes.  Use one unique QR code for each John, and then throw it away after that.
