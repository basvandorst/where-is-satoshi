Lol that's ok. I really don't give af. I'll let you believe what you want.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:44:30
Lol ok? Exactly. What's your point?
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:45:11
Lol right. "Adults." Adults are investing in real securities, junior.

Lol says the child who left a comment with no substance at all and thinks that bitcoin just "survives" because it can. Do you even know what you've bought into? Lol 
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:36:22
Lol you said a lot of stuff while also saying nothing at all.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:57:13
That could not be further from the truth. Is this really what bitcoin investors believe? My goodness no wonder it's tanking.

"The time of year when everything drops" ������ Uhm have you seen the stock market?

No i agree it's still way up from what it was early 2017. No arguing that. I'm not judging it based on its meteoric fall, WHICH you cannot ignore, pal. I judge it based on the people that invest in it. Just a bunch of first time investors that had no clue wtf they were buying into. Bitcoin is last years Pokemon Go, guy. I think there may be potential in bitcoin, however there is no hope st all for its investors.

BAHAHAHAHAHAHHAA IT DIDNT EVEN TAKE MORE THAN A DAY. Time to jump ship, junior. Go watch a YouTube video on how actual investments work and then go pretend to be an expert somewhere else.
