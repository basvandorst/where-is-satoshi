It doesn't matter when you buy bitcoin. What matters is when you sell.

High fees are good for bitcoin. They allow miners to have the same profitability without increasing inflation rate. BCH comes with lower fees, but to make it profitable they are forced to increase inflation. In other words, in BTC fees are collected from those who transact, while in BCH fees are included in the price.

So is your plan to sell when it dips below where it was 2 years ago? Sounds like a loser strategy. Tru HODLer shouldn't care about time.

So next we have a dip I know somebody just bought Lamborghini.

I think it's ok that people sell. The more whales sell the more fairly BTC is distributed.
The only reason you care about the price is because you hope to sell it at some point.

So if one has good memory and remembers private keys by heart, does it count as carrying?

But if nobody moves their bitcoin, all blocks will be empty!

By liquidating do you mean converting to fiat? I think fiat is less liquid than bitcoin.

No, I'm just not greedy, and I don't want to rob newcomers.

They probably flippened already ;)

It is. When the shit coin pops, its holders will flock back to -jesus- bitcoin.
