I like your username too
Just like 'God', Bitcoin's power and glory is non-existent; a lot of hullabaloo over nothing. A belief scheme for schmucks.

You can make the buyer pay the fees with Paypal too, as any Ebay seller knows

You're just creating a rod for your own back
Millions of merchants you say.. well if true, are there customers to match?
There are less than a million Bitcoin users, most of whom only have amounts totaling a handful of dollars - and how many of those remaining plan to cash in their Bitcoin for overpriced products anyway?

Great, more spam.

I just sent them an email commending them, and cited my own registered small business (even though I don't actually accept Bitcoin of course)
I had to add a question/complaint obviously, so I expressed my concern with Australian Bitcoin exchanges running off with customers money. I explained that this could harm my business, either through defrauding my porential customers, or even defrauding my own business, and recommended more strict regulation. 
I also pointed out that the most popular Australian exchange was co-founded and  run by Zhou Tong, a notorious fraudster operating under different names who ran off when his previous exchange 'Bitcoinica' failed. I finished by acknowledging this might not be the purview of their department, and so recommended they forward it to the relevant department.

I suspect you're wrong there. If not the gamblers, it's usually those who facilitate gambling that pay the tax. It is often illegal to gamble using unlicensed online gambling facilities.


Yes, but the big problem you run into is actually converting Bitcoin into dollars or material wealth.
Even if you avoid going through the mainstream exchanges and using bank accounts (both which must report to the state on significant transactions, and can nab you using KYC information), you might just receive a polite letter in the mail asking you to explain why there's a Lamborghini registered in your name when you only work a $500/week job.

I should have clarified that I contacted the ATO directly
What OP doesn't seem to realize is that taxation determinations do not go through parliament, so contacting MPs is futile.
The only possible exception I can think of to this is active disallowance of the determination, but I think it only applies to tax *rulings* and not *determinations* - not to mention it is most often more difficult to strike down that which exists than to pass it, as say an act of legislation.
