Hes the one also touting ubi right? Ubi might very well be the future but as a realistic candidate in today's America? Literally 0% chance.

That's like... that's not how it works at all. If I buy bitcoin will a credit card and immediately send that bitcoin to a wallet... it's gone. There is no getting it back. They cant block the transaction. They cant reverse it. It's already been purchased and is sent out. You're just wrong here. In so many ways. Theres literally no way to get it back.

It doesnt. Just dont try to hide your money. It's that simple. If you want to live in the western world then you will always have to pay taxes. If you dont want to pay like the rest of us, then move out of the west. But then you lose all the things you love that the west has. It's a VERY EASy choice in my mind.

You're not giving them enough. Crypto is different. If someone steals my credit card and buys crypto and sends that money to a wallet, it's gone. Like gone gone. That's why they started implementing this and it honestly makes total sense. Stop thinking that every single aspect of the world is secretly trying to fuck you over. It isnt.

And I answered. That site doesnt work for whales. They barely trade 1 full bitcoin a day. They cant handle a whale taking out 50k bitcoin. I'm not a whale and they couldn't handle my volume. This op is a shill. He constantly trashes coinbase and constantly talks up bisq. Look at his history.

I didnt say it was a gift. You are asking banks to knowingly and willingly take on an enormous risk that they simply dont have to. You're being outrageous and the world doesnt work like this. Grow up or dont. Either way the banks arent being unfair about this. It takes a simple call and they let you purchase it. One single call vs the banks taking BILLIONS of dollars worth of risk. The banks dont owe you shit. They dont have to do anything. If you dont like it that much, use a different bank. Its literally that simple. But stop acting like they are out to get you. They arent. They are just trying to stop themselves from losing a shitload of money.
Also the seller isnt out. There are no regulations on crypto right now. The bank takes the loss. Not the seller you idiot. That might change with regulations. But right now, that's a fact.

Rofl ok. I hate paying taxes as much as the next guy. I just dont want people getting into serious financial troubles because they listen to dumbasses on the internet. They dont just take back the money you owe, ya know. They take ALL your money and garnish your future wages and possibly lock you up. Keep hiding your money if you want. I'll stay out of jail and still make plenty of money off my crypto, thank you.
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:49:29
You support robinhood but not coinbase. You are fucking retarded... you cant even withdraw your crypto from robinhood. What the actual fuck. This dude is CLEARLY A SHILL.

How about taking out a loan and maxing out 3 credit cards when it below 5k? I did!!! I was right too. Everyone told me I was an idiot but I already sold and paid the 3 cards and loan and just kept the rest so whatever I make from here is sheer profit. Every single person ever has told me not to touch crypto. And they are all middle class or poor. People cant stand the idea of you being smart enough to actually make a lot of money while they spent 50 years struggling. Dont let other people tell you what to do with YOUR money. Just be prepared to actually lose it.
@_date: 2019-07-14 19:34:25
It actually makes 100% sense. People take credit cards and buy crypto then immediately send it to a new address. It basically makes it so the bank can NEVER get their money back. I was upset too but their reasoning is REALLY sound.
@_date: 2019-07-17 00:02:24
Only one that I have heard announce support right now. There could be more. But I keep up with politics and havent heard of any others.
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:56:03
You are clearly a shill and coinbase got subpoenaed. Theres a fucking difference. They would have been shut down. And you are clearly a anarchist. You are openly trying to get people in trouble. Most these people listening to you are gonna get assblasted 5 years down the road because they are listening to some dumbass (you) on the internet about hiding money instead of just following the law and paying taxes like normal fucking functioning members of society.
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:47:18
Dont try to cheat your government. It's that simple. Listening to the anarchist on these subs is gonna get you in trouble. You make one tiny mistake 10 years down the road and the government isnt just gonna take your taxes, they are gonna take it ALL plus slap you with enormous fines. It's not fucking worth it. It's just not.

Keep buying to even the price out if you truly believe. I started buying at 9k all the way to 20. I stopped buying during the collapse but started buying when it dipped below 5k. I bought enough that my average buy is in the 6ks now. I'm significantly in the green because of this. So yeah.
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:57:45
They have 1. But he also supports ubi which could very well be the future but has literally 0 chance to win in today's America. We cant even get healthcare for everyone and he thinks he can win saying the government should be giving out checks to everyone.
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:02:22
You are being an idiot because you wont take 2 fucking seconds to Google. There are absolutely no regulations on crypto right now. So NO!!!! YOU ARE WRONG. the seller isnt taking the loss. There are literally no laws forcing them to. What is so hard to understand about this? And a lot of fucking exchanges arent even American you fucking dipshit. My God. GOOGLE IS YOUR FRIEND. IT REALLY IS. The only exchange doing this is coinbase because they went ahead and started following regulations even when they didnt have to just to be prepared. God lord dude.

The case was never about whether he was satoshi or not. The case was simply a "Craig openly states he mined 1 million bitcoins with kleiman." Does kleimans estate get half?
@_date: 2019-08-29 00:03:27
I know what an anarchist and a libertarian is. But the only "libertarians" I've ever actually meet arent libertarian. They are anarchist that use the name libertarian because if you go around saying you are a anarchist, the public will look down on you.
@_date: 2019-08-29 13:15:51
I hope you have a wonderful day sir. But I'm done with this convo. Wish you the best tho
@_date: 2019-08-27 12:58:20
The case was never about if he was satoshi or not so the judge didnt care. It was about whether half the bitcoins that he "says" he mined with kleiman is half kleiman whose dead now. The judge ruled it is.
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:20:16
Can we just go ahead and call libertarians what they are? Anarchist. They want the end to modern governments without thinking about what happens when all the west militaries are no longer standing and China / russia comes knocking. Its fucking stupid. I feel ashamed I used to call myself a libertarian when I was a teenager.
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:32:22
And how exactly is bitcoin gonna stop China from putting all those people in concentration camps? Or stop them from rounding up protestor in Hong Kong? Wars will always be a thing dude...

When this platform came out the idea or a quantum computer hacking it was literal science fiction. No one could've guessed how fast google would get their quantum machines up and running. Also we arent talking small money here. It's not about safety and security. You should NEVER  put more than 6 figures into 1 account unless you have billions and can afford to just take a 6 figure hit.
@_date: 2019-09-21 01:09:25
More 10k. It's always high 9. Low 10. Way more 10 than 9. Its 10k dude. People gotta chill. We are like 3-5 months into a 2 year upwards trend. Sit back and relax.
Oct 16k. Nov-dec 20k. Then a run to 50k over the next year after that. Followed by 2 years of a steady down trend. I'd bet hard money on it. In fact I am.
@_date: 2019-09-29 12:27:27
Right, like if anyone is storing hundreds of coins into 1 wallet them that's a problem. If you have hundreds of bitcoins then you have to money to spread those funds out.
@_date: 2019-09-29 15:07:04
It still takes out the middle man. The banks. So it still is solving issues and problems. Just not all of them.
@_date: 2019-09-20 13:02:07
I mean that's why you dont make never statements in crypto. I've been saying it will fluctuate between 9-12k until October and then a run to 16k will come.
