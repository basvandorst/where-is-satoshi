So, although the price is rising again now, once the whole MtGox debacle is shed more light upon and more intricate details may surface on how they handeled this, is a there more panicking to be expected and an even larger trainwreck?

Can someone here give me a quick list of data that was necessary to get "verified" status on gox? I only have an email copy that states I am verified, but not which documents I actually sent. Did you only get verified on Gox when you provided your bank account information? Trying to figure out if they *only* have my identification info or my banking info as well.
Thank you.

I know Gox is shit and everyone wants out and there's this malleabilty problem that's slowly getting fixed, but now that things are slowly returning to normal (are they? they are, right?), why is the current situation considered to be a trainwreck in the first place? Thans for doing this.

So much hate in the comment section. Seems like all Bitcoin users are fools and criminals.
From what I've read, I have gotten under the impression that the current problems with transaction malleability and the sr hack are completely unrelated?

Thank you for taking the time to reply! 
If the latter became true and they can't cover it, the road adhead should be pretty bumpy. Especially in the light of SilkRoad being robbed naked also (by whomever).
I personally think, and this is totally coming from my guts, in the long run, there's no going ignoring cryptocurrencies and BTC in particular. I also can't see what could replace them now this trend has started and even knocked on the door of the masses.

I'd really like to write the author, since I feel this casts a unecessarly bad light on the Bitcoin community, but I'm really bad with words and also pretty new to the whole thing, so I guess I'll just shut up for now :/
Sucks a lot though, Spiegel isn't exactly small and has quite some power when it comes to influencing the public's mind.

I had one but I sold her for BTC.

So someone wanted to rake in a large volume of coins and thus had to pay up to the highest price?
