Thanks that was exactly what I needed to hear, I was worried that if I tried to manually post the same TX using another client it could cause a problem. Worked in 10 seconds.

I'm not sure why this isn't the focus, OP is suggesting something the software is not coded to do. 
I find it highly unlikely that through some flaw multibit deviated from it's code on this one occasion.

Vault of Satoshi rocks btw.
I had a problem with a wire and I needed the funds asap. So they personally called and arranged an alterantive payment method.
Then called back in the morning to make sure everything was OK and I had it in my account.

So if you have no control over your keys how does it help you in any way?  If you do have control over your keys then you need confirmations to avoid double spends. Also you haven't factored in the handling of fiat either.
Your second point doesn't make any sense. Where do the coins go in the interim? Between the batch trades. I mean the guy who sold the coins gets his money straight away and then you need to wait until the batch trade to re-trade your BTC.
I think you had good intentions with your initial post but you don't seem to understand the workings or purpose of a HFT exchange. Which is made clear by the fact that none of the companies you listed who used it are actually exchanges.
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:34:11
Which would not work in an exchange hence the top comment undermining it. If it was done like this then EVERY transaction would need to wait for confirms. How would HFT work with 15 minutes between each transaction? Every coin would also be in a hot wallet.
Should they also have a separate bank account per person on the site?
The real shame is that this idea is being supported when it CANNOT be implemented on an exchange. It is imperative for online wallets etc but on an exchange platform it is not possible.
It would be wonderful if there was a way of trading with no trust in the platform but there isn't (in any market) and therefore you have to do the research and make an educated decision. 
This exact same thing happened with gold reserves in the 80's with people claiming to be holding huge stocks of gold and people buying and trading, until they needed to sell and there was none there. The change that was made was not putting each persons individual stash into a separate box but by investing in those who had followed proper practices and were properly registered.
Independent security and financial audits are and have always been the way of verifying exchange solvency and security eg. the recent coinbase audit.

Depends on what type of account. BMO business doesn't offer interac (or at least didn't when I had to use it).
Also it doesn't apply to credit unions or smaller financial institutions. Interac is pretty good but trust me having been stuck in SE Asia with intermittent power, email transferring yourself money is a nightmare in comparison to just clicking send and walking to an ATM.

I have used bitstamp, kraken, CAvirtex, cryptsy and BTC-E over the years and aside from the volume VoS has been my favourite.
They could do with a little bit of an overhall of the orders page (maybe have a column for buying and one for selling) but beyond that it has worked flawlessly and whenever I have a problem I get help on the phone straight away.

The suggestion of allocated wallets for an exchange is a gross misunderstanding of how an exchange functions.

An ASIC is an application-specific integrated circuit. A circuit designed to do one thing and one thing only. Therefore it is not unreasonable to expect a warranty, as it was designed and built specially to operate under these conditions.

I have my BTC wallet running inside a virtual machine.
So even if they steal the password from the keystrokes they don't have access to the wallet file. Also the virus is only on the host machine not the virtualised OS.

That's my theory on the slow price decline we're seeing just now. Merchant adoption outpacing user adoption, or at least the uptake by larger merchants.
Most companies use bitpay and pay out straight into fiat.
@_date: 2014-08-12 19:59:45


No you add a payee,
* Then you add a secret question
 
* Then you send the transfer
* Then you wait on the email 
 
* Then you sign into your email and click accept.
 
* Then you sign into your other bank account to accept it.
* Sign into bank account
* Type sort code and account number or click on payee (you can also nowadays use email or phone number and there's an app for it that syncs with your contacts)
* Click Send
I'm not meaning to labour this point but the Canadian banking system is one of the worst I have used. They charge me $20 a month to even have one, then add $1 charges if I use it too much. I have so far never been able to receive an international wire due to their refusal to sign onto international banking standards. I also had a member of staff have his cheque held for 28 days because it was a new company. That's a whole month, how can it take a month to transfer money from one account to another?

Simple way to find out, send him an email quoting that response. Saying something along the lines of "I read both your letter to federal regulators and also your response to..."
Then see what he has to drag up.

I agree that is more an American bank sucks thing. Payment from bank to bank inside the UK is within an hour and free.

That's how many people they are about to ban for having multiple accounts!
@_date: 2015-11-21 21:25:03


Britain has laws exactly for this purpose already though. It is illegal to refuse to give up a password or encryption keys if required to by a court order.
So we do NOT need new legislation for this, if tech companies offer a back door then guess what happens. Nothing, they still have a bunch of garbled information going across the network and they have to actually arrest the person before they can read it.
At which point...they can just use existing legislation to handle it. 
@_date: 2015-11-15 00:05:11
Yeah pretty much means...it's not Gemini's fault if they can't fix it.
For example if the user has withdrawn their balance and it's not recoverable.
@_date: 2015-11-21 21:53:20


Your logic is pretty flawed here as those same people would just illegally use end to end encryption whether it's legal or not.
@_date: 2015-11-21 22:26:19


The law has nothing to do with banning end to end encryption, just that there has to be a back door. Read the article, the problem is offering of unbreakable encryption, not the use of it.
So people can still use it all they want, just Google, Apple et al can't build it into products. What does this achieve that current laws wouldn't?

I finished university and had a bank account in the UK but I left and didn't read the terms and conditions of my overdraft so they closed it after inactivity. It wasn't overdrawn just it had been more than 5 months since I used it.
I have collected and traded in things since I was very young so I funded my time in North America by sending a large amount of ancient coins to auction. That I spent on a mixture of collectable high end glass marbles (like $300-1500 marbles) and bullion. Then when I ran out of the options to extend my visa I decided to go to Asia so I sold all my marbles for a fairly hefty profit and dipped out to Thailand and Cambodia. 
Then I hit mainland Europe for a bit thinking I could sell some bullion and get a bank account, but my outstanding debt on my old bank account meant I couldn't. This pissed me off because I'd told them I was going away for a year and they said it didn't matter. So I decided fuck it put a bunch of money into BTC and bought and sold bullion a bit. 
Now I'm back in Canada and I finally got a bank account again but I haven't really used it yet except to deposit a couple grand to pay for flights for a friend.
As for the limits I don't care I did my stint as an anarchist hippy when I was younger so IDGAF about visas and border rules beyond not getting banned from coming back (or in the case of Asia getting shot in the face)
TLDR Bank account got closed so I just traded in collectables, bullion and BTC to survive

I am no expert but.
Gold again the fact that gold doesn't tarnish makes it very useful in small electronics, where any buildup on contacts can be a problem. Also it is much less prone to becoming brittle with changes in temperature, for example a computer cycling from on to off.
I'm pretty sure a lot of silver is gold plated and in the case of pure gold it's usually alloyed with nickel or something to add durability.
Having said that I horde silver rather than gold because it makes me feel more like a pirate, due to the larger quantities.

Everyone claims that modern currency systems are backed by nothing, but without a modern currency what is gold's value?
If you can't express it in dollars then there is no value other than belief. Now that belief may be rooted in history but it is still just a currency of faith. Throughout the Roman Empire the silver currency was continually debased but whether you had a denarius with 3.9g of silver in it or 3g it was still a denarius and bought you the same on the street.
Basically the ancient version of printing more money was debasing coinage.

You should also learn what you are talking about cgminer is none of those things. It is just a command line miner.

I didn't have a bank account for years. I only just got one a few months ago (actually a joint account with my wife).

Yeah I don't have a permanent address anywhere in the world any more. It's been almost 3 years since I last did so I rarely have access to a bank account. I finally opened one in Canada with a friend cosigning for me but it's useless because I can't work here and always have cash, bullion or bitcoin.
Bitcoin has definitely made my border crossings and money moving easier.

A large part of the appeal of gold was it's extreme difficulty to counterfeit. Not only was it rare, but it is very dense (so a small piece ways a lot which is hard to fake) and does not tarnish.
