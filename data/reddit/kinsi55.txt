That, indeed makes the start blazing fast (&lt;2 seconds).
Whats the worst that could result out of this? A faulty transaction history? If i am not worried about security, and only do transactions trough the client iself i suppose this wont necessarily lead to any problems right?
Also, happy cakeday!
**Edit:** Going by this, i tried to raise it to 100 and saw, that it works quick up until 50%, aka 50 Blocks. After that it slowed down a heckton.
Setting checkblocks to a value of 50 is the highest i can go without the start slowing down.

Its a 7200rpm 1tb disk, and no its not failing. I am running antivirus, and shadowplay is permanently recording onto that disk as well.
Neither of these things should be an issue because it used to be faster in the same configuration. The disk is dedicated to backups / BTC blocks / shadowplay, nothing else runs on that.
Performance test of the disk while shadowplay is recording shows 60 mb/s seq read and 90 seq write @ 170 / 900 IOPS respectively.
**Ninja edit:** Disabled AV and the verification is still slow. I am running a (overclocked) i7 4790k btw.

I have found out whats happening and a workaround, see the edit [in the reply below](

Looks like my "resolved" state was a result caches. I have rebooted my PC now and its back to its slow state, even with dbcache of 300 and checkblocks of 100, it takes like 20-30 seconds per block from the start on now.
@_date: 2016-08-27 02:59:13
I am having this issue since like a month and hoped for it to resolve itself. Also, isnt the block verification completely offline? I am not talking about syncing or reindexing, the plain verifcating blocks... thing on start up takes ages.
@_date: 2016-08-27 03:26:40
Okay thank you. I've placed an edit into the comment with a new path as to what makes it so slow, maybe you have a more exact idea as to what happens.

its 170 read iops sec. No idea how exact the measurement is, dont have crystaldiskmark installed, this was done in samsung magician (the SSD software).
Yes, its attached via SATA(3).
Copying files to / from it to / from my SSD is fine &amp; fast as well.
@_date: 2016-08-27 03:47:50
I have now lowered the dbcache to 300M instead of 2G, leaving the checkblocks at default. Its back to what it used to be in terms of speed.
I can gurantee my system wasnt swapping, right now (core off) i have about 5G free, so that should be enough considering a dbcache of 2G.
The reason i even had it that high is that people told more more = better when i asked if theres a way to speed up the sync, i guess ill roll with less now :)
Thank you a lot, and thank you as well :)
@_date: 2016-08-27 03:36:45
Setting a dbcache of 300(m i guess?) indeed does make it fast**er**, it still takes about 30 seconds though with a checkblocks value of 100, the slowdown after 50% is noticeable still as well. My ram usage is at 7/12GB atm so thats not the bottleneck either.

@_date: 2018-01-02 22:13:14
Ah i see, thats why i said two comments up that you're right about the receiver part, and doing the "routing" of the payment wont happen. Your tip goes to the bots wallet and the recipient can either cash it out on-chain once a week or so or open a new LN channel himself and pre-fund it with the funds that have been tipped to him sort o say.
OFC LN is not as easy as using the 2nd layer a service / site provides itself, the huge plus though is that you never need to trust your funds to the service.

You could counter-argument that the code of the ledger is not open source because of the secure enclave chip being "security by obscurity". If somebody manages to reverse engineer how that chip works you are just as fucked, or even more so, because you'd find yourself reading the data off the storage chip as opposed to having just one microcontroller with integrated storage (Which is wiped if you install a custom firmware)

I am not much into ln (yet), however, i believe to be a "relevant" node you'd need to have channels open to multiple other (relevant) nodes and have a decent amount of your funds locked into the channel to allow your node to route payments.

An LN tip bot would make sense in regards to not having to trust your funds to the bot provider, at least before you actually do the tip. Either way, you could set it up in a way where you can send tips to people who are not registered, that would be stored on the bot, or where registered ones are relayed the payment in their own LN channel.
@_date: 2018-01-14 09:25:57
That they do not get shut down, but often all but one or two lanes are closed, thus a traffic jam occurs. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 04:25:35
Even IF ln becomes adopted, the current onchain space is not enough. I agree with not hardforking NOW to increase the blocksize, but at some point, (ideally, when the next HF for an upgrade is scheduled and segwit has been adopted as well as big players actually making use of best practices) it should include a blocksize increase, and since we need more blockspace NOW, theres your option.

Wrong, you'd still need physical access to it (As far as i remember, feel free to prove me wrong). I am aware of the NDA, and that is exactly what makes it secure using obscurity: If nobody knows how it works nobody can (try to) "exploit" it.
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:48:48
Hm, couldnt find a link to that presumed method, but since SRAM attacks are not possible at all with 1.5.2 (And powerline analysis leaks have been patched ages ago) ima guess that said method does not exist anymore either.
Yeah, a bummer that it happened, but what doesnt kill you only makes you stronger ;) The fact that trezor is fully open source, yet secure means something. See the current electrum bug. That is a HUGE, dumb oversight. Are you going to stop using electrum now? No.
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:16:58
With as much respect as possible i am going to ask you: You say while we wait for a proper solution (e.g. LN), more improvements (e.g. Schnorr) and every player in the game to make use of techniques like Batching people should stop using BTC alltogether, and / or bite the bullet and pay fees often 20%+ of their transaction instead of, temporarily, having bigger blocks to clear up congestion?
I'd love to see proof that 2MB blocks are remotely harder to process than 1MB ones. 8MB? Maybe, 2MB? No.
@_date: 2018-01-02 09:38:03
Ty. Does a Lightning based tip bot exist yet / is anyone working on one? I feel like Ln would be the perfect usecase for that.
Also unrelated, but something i've been wondering: Is it possible to add new onchain funds into an opened LN channel ? (without having to close it that is). I dont think its possible, but i'd love to be proven wrong :D

@_date: 2018-01-07 10:08:03
That exploit was fixed though since? The only currently known attack vector would be dissolving the chip down to the die and putting it under an electron microscope to read out the data. This is EXTREMELY difficult and costs a ton (To a point where its almost never feasible to actually *attempt*, and has never been done before), as well as having a high risk of destroying the chip entirely in the process.

@_date: 2017-12-23 05:49:17
Its nothing to do with blocks. You can include whatever transactions you want. And even if another pool happens to include your tx before you get the chance to, on average you still dont end up making a loss thanks to the driven up fee market, especially when you control half of the overall mining power like jihad does. Just spam in TXs with high fees, however below the current top 1 MB slice and you will very likely get your "investment" back.

I do not disagree with anything, at the point in time when he wrote it that likely was the best possibility-/ies he had invisioned, but if you have a car that burns stupid amount of fuel, what do you think would be the solution? Would you rather add a bigger fuel tank so you can still burn unnecessary amount of fuel, or would you rather switch to alternative transportation methods like public transit or a bike, which still get you to your destination? In the meanwhile Cars can be developed that are more efficient and use less fuel (See, Schnorr as an example, or compressed public keys as done in the past).
BCH does not solve any problem, it is just offloading it to a later date. Putting the same into my car anology would require everyone to get a bigger fuel tank into their cars, and since theres no visible problem to them anymore they would not care to use public transit or the like (Here, the more range you get = less fees, not the price you pay for the fuel). (Same state right now where we kinda "force" people to use SegWit, try to make people in a way that is more economically friendly (Transaction batching) as opposed to going full throttle whenever the traffic light hits green)
Have you ever thought about.. What will happen when all BTC have been mined? What will happen after the next two halvenings? Do you think miners are still going to mine if the transactions that they mine sum up to maybe 1 btc in fees while the reward they get is 3btc? No, certainly not.

@_date: 2017-12-24 09:10:01
Tbh, I feel like the next hf that adds sth (like schnorr) should also include a 2mb, or better yet a dynamic block limit (e.g. One that increases up to 4mb in the time span up to the next halvening) to decrease the possibility of getting into where we currently are, again. Propagating a 2mb block within 10 minutes is no rocketscience.
Or you know, what about a block size limit that moves in accordance to the previous blocks? Previous 5 blocks have been filled at least 98%? Up the limit by X. Blocks become empty again? Lower by X. Keep in bounds of 2-4mb. Done. Probably hard to implement properly, just a brainstorm. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:51:08
You dont mine them slower, you mine them at the speed they're meant to be mined instead of abusing an exploit patented by jihad, thus only included in his miners. Not sure right now but i think asicboost also caused empty blocks to be mined, so theres that as well (dont quote me on that)

Every tx has some overhead that exists to make the tx happen, even before including the outputs. If you now settle 10 cash outs at once instead of 1 the overhead caused is lower.

Mempool is empty down to &lt;100sat/b. ~1$, that is for a confirmation within two blocks pretty much guranteed. If you can wait longer, you can pay less. Down to 30-40sat sounds promising rn to me to confirm within 24hrs

^(*But.. but Core didnt increase blocksize when* ***i*** *wanted it so i dont want to support them now* ��)

Because Roger and Jihan think they are some kind of saints that know what's best for BTC and will wave around their money as much as needed to force it down our throats while in reality they are retards who ignore obvious technical flaws of their implementation that couldn't survive as an alt coin so they try to promote themselves of what core has achieved and blame them for the high fees and "stalled development" while it's the miners that obviously *WANT* higher fees because why the fuck not would you ignore segwit, a solution ready to go *right now* that buys time to carefully plan the future.

Yes, there is a hardlimit of 140 characters. (=1MB limit). They could up the limit (=Hardfork, 3rd party apps have to adapt etc) but instead decided to make better use of the space available (Apps still have to adapt to make use of it, but work just as fine without adapting to the changes).

It's "pseudo" open-source where ppl can only contribute if Whitelisted, has had multiple huge vulnerabilities that caused tons of issues (bad / untested code) and just upping the blocksize is not a viable long-term solution to the scaling problem.

Because i strongly believe its in the interest to steer the ship in the right direction and not crash it, and it eventually will crash if nothing will happen, because even if it should gain more adoption / users it will just get slower and slower as a result. This has been long forseeable, and the only reason this whole piece of shit argument even exists is the reason that nothing was done about it. Imagine core forking to 2mb waaay back, say last year. Bcash would not have been a thing, 2x certainly not, and maybe not even the other sub. Call them shills, call them trolls, but their main idea, that core currently is not able to keep up with the amount of usage is absolutely correct.
Telling people to just pay more fees - why not just use wire transfers that end up cheaper?   
Telling people to just set low fees and wait - why not just put the cash in an envelope and mail it? Will be just as fast / faster.
Current usage is not a spike, it very much is / would be / become the norm if it was possible.

Today, as bitcoins blocks are filled to the brim, and blocktime went up a lot because many miners switched to mine bch (which now has a 1-2 minute block time, as opposed to the 10 minute target, because they now have a lot MORE mining power and the network has not adjusted yet). 3 days ago you could sent tx's that confirmed relatively fast for &lt;$1

@_date: 2017-11-10 23:30:41


Look, im full for core here, but up until recently i thought RBF allows to raise the fee of a TX (because i never really checked what is really is / cared about it), not replace the entire tx completely (thus even making it possible to more or less have a way to "charge back" TX's when dealing with people that dont know better), and now i see where judas gets the whole "0 conf is safe for bcash" argument from, and gotta say, i dislike RBF being a thing as well.
BUT, i gotta also say that core has to scale, sooner than later. This is not just a occasional spike. Ideally, mempool should be emptied out every time a block is found. If it is not, the network cannot handle the amount of TX's (and mempool hasnt been empty in ages), and just because the blocks are smaller, tx's wont stop flowing in. In the end, the amount of space used up by the blockchain wont be less with smaller blocks than with bigger ones because the TX's eventually will get processed.
2MB seems totally reasonable to myself. I see how 8MB can possibly cause issues, but i do not see how it can be hard to propagate a 2MB block within 10 minutes of time, because it is not.
The idea behind BTC is to be cheap, fast, easy to use and somewhat anonymous, and currently, pretty much neither of those things is actually true apart from the last one, and i absolutely hate seeing it be what it is because **it being what it is allows judas to get people into bcash in the first place**. All they have to do is announce a 2MB fork aimed at Q1 2018 including Schnorr, possibly LN and possibly one of the proposals for making future blocksize scaling possible w/o a HF. Done, BTC is the leader again.
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:42:18

@_date: 2017-11-03 00:08:08
1mb is an *arbitrary* limit, who decided it is *safe*(-er than a bigger one, i guess satoshi), and based of which factors?. Propagating a 2mb block within 10 minutes at todays standards is no harder than propagating at 1mb one. If you have a down / upload speed of at least 30 k**bit**/s you have no issue downloading 2 meg in 10 minutes (and the actual time to verify its integrity is really not that relevant, because that is no long at all), let alone 90% having way more than that, thus leaving more time for the propagation, so i dont see how 2mb is so destructive vs 1mb.

Everytime someone gets banned here they run to the other sub and create a post being full "happy" and acting like they've achieved something, saying how they got banned for no reason while when checking their comment history all they post here is how good bch / how bad btc ist, how blockstream / mods censor shit and all that stuff.

While that is correct it still does not disprove what he said. Unfortunately with this argument "they" are right, the only reason bcash is what it is rn is because btc cannot handle the amount of TX it has had over the past months. If the mempool ever is not empty after a block has been found, and it is not a short spike, the network is overloaded, and BTC's mempool has not been empty in ages. I know they are working on it, but that this issue is slowly occouring has been obvious for over half a year, and even if they are working on a permanent solution / "offchain" "workaround", a temporary solution to buy more time should've been since implemented.

Maybe you can find it on some other source like ebay or sth. I had it running like this for almost half a year with no issues. Using the powerbank now for its designed use and it doesn't seem to have lost any capacity whatsoever, suggesting that it worked the way advertised. I'd suggest against cheapo no name branded ones as they are not really designed for such use and will likely break down after a while (not saying that the Anker one is really designed for that, but Anker generally produces pretty high quality stuff, and it worked for me so that's 100% success with a samplesize of 1 :D)

Just imagine everyone's wallets were a database (which they arent, as that is the "selling point" of btc).
Now this database is copied, renamed, and thus exists twice. You ofc then have a copy of your wallet in both.

As long as the packaging wasn't damaged and wrapped when you got it, as well as the casing having no obvious sign of being opened, and it prompted you to install the firmware on setup, you will very likely be fine.

Yes and no. It's hard to explain but satoshi "owns" his coins. He *could* spend them, this goes for anyone holding a big amount of btc. If any of the ripples that are "kept off the market" are spent that would be like creating btc out of thin air, it would hurt the economy.

@_date: 2017-07-03 17:51:16
lightning / schnorr signatures. When the latter is implemented, tested and ready to be deployed one could think about if a blocksize increase makes sense as it requires a hardfork to be deployed. A hardfok just to increase the blocksize is dumb. Segwit is, and always was the way to go right now to get some headroom/time to implement schnorr signatures but you can thank jihad and judas that we are where we are rn.
@_date: 2017-07-29 23:49:57
Exactly. They know nobody would care about a fork that doesnt have bitcoin in its name, at least they get that right.

@_date: 2017-07-31 23:36:26
Because theres multiple chains, and you have coins on each one, but you dont want to / cant send your transactions on all chains. Multiple chains are essentially multiple coins. You dont want to send your bcash to somebody just because you send them bitcoins, vice versa. Some chains are entirely different/split off (bcash), others (try to) "merge" (uasf, segwit2x) by being compatible / having consensus.

But its there, tested and ready to be deployed. Even IF it never takes of, you might as well have to option for it. Just like i said, SW is no permanent solution, its merely a temporary solution, a better alternative to hardforking just to increase the blocksize. A blocksize increase should be deployed as a hardfork IF the hardfork is actually meaningful, in terms of implementing stuff that is only deployable with a hardfork (see, schnorr signatures).
@_date: 2017-07-31 02:16:53

Because he said A) that his system is encrypted and B) he doesnt have any backups. The no-rebooting part is for petya as it will bluescreen your system. If you do not reboot after it does you can still recover your data, rebooting however will run a fake checkdisk which will encrypt stuff irreversibly.
