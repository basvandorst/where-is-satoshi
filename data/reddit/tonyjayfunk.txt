Whales buying up BTC short futures to hedge their position. It doesn’t mean that they will dump their positions and drive the prices down. Their hedge may be partial as well depending on the amount of exposure and risk they’re willing to take. Bottom line, they’re loading up and drive the market higher.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:44:11
Futures will allow big funds to buy protection and hedge against a drop in bitcoin price. The assumption here is they hold a position in the underlying asset which is complicated at the moment. However some players start to offer custodian services like Coinbase. 
I believe that the main purpose of futures is risk management, not speculation. And even if futures provide market direction thanks to their liquidity and ease of trade, they’re not the deep cause of price movements.
My belief is that futures are great step forward in the ecosystem, and will help the price discovery process by allowing bets on both sides.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:45:46
Better price discovery and less volatility ultimately 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:00:43
Eth dipped as well
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:54:52
Op you forget to mention that the other side of the deal might buy bitcoin to cover their underwriting and avoid being in a “naked” position.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:50:01
EDIT: Price skyrocketing this way is absolutely amazing. I very rarely seen this in my trading life. Futures will be completely legit to hedge investors against huge swings, and ultimately tame this volatility.

At this moment, there might be a big player buying big chunks of bitcoins, accumulating before the price skyrockets again.

Media coverage is poor,  and too few entrepreneurs diving in. France has also a particular relationship to money..  and taxes (ie recent speech of Moscovici minister of finance and fierce opponent to anything that would give extra work to the tax admin)

Being a 'genious' and being 'successful '  are two different things. If you master something you usually want to get deep into it and research is often one of the best ways to achieve that kind of goal.

I imagine the future of remittance will be BitATM to BitATM process. The risk taken will be up to the recipients. The faster they convert their bitcoins to fiat, the less risk they take. Compared to 7% commissions (WU), I hope that in time the price volatility will make it economically feasible.

Stock markets have been up since yesterday following polls that Brexit won't happen. This downtrend is a good news because it shows that people start moving money between stock market to bitcoin, reinforcing its status of an asset class that start to count.
There is a lot of uncertainty Brexit, Yuan, halving, so expect a lot of volatility.
