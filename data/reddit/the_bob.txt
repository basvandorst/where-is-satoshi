In the past, 1000 BTC did not equal $600,000. To effectively mix that amount of money, you need at least that amount of money being mixed along with yours. When you mixed 1000 BTC they were probably worth a few dollars each or so.

The blockchain in it's current configuration is already 90GB which is practically half of my 256 GB SSD (which was $250 or so). Larger blocks will continue to force out consumer full-nodes and force them into centralized datacenters which will be similar to the Chinese miner situation. 
@_date: 2016-04-04 15:22:31
Force Bible verses on others? You have to actually work to find the text in the blockchain. I wouldn't consider that "forcing on others." Also, the text was included in the coinbase signature of blocks mined by him and/or Eligius. So, if anything, him "forcing on others" is actually him helping secure the network.

Perpetuating the ill-named spin-off of Bitcoin is ridiculous on its own at this point, but especially so considering (the creator of bcash, mind you) has started calling it "bcash" too. There is no more an official source for determining what to call it than \*its creator\*. 
@_date: 2014-10-20 00:08:06
He was the chief oversight on security matters at blockchain.info.  3rd parties should never be trusted with bitcoin, let alone parties that have blatant security mishaps like blockchain.info. The fact he was in a chief position is troubling at best.

"Bit" is already a standard unit. 
The International Electrotechnical Commission issued standard IEC 60027, which specifies that the symbol for binary digit should be bit, and this should be used in all multiples, such as kbit, for kilobit.[6] However, the lower-case letter b is widely used as well and was recommended by the IEEE 1541 Standard (2002). In contrast, the upper case letter B is the standard and customary symbol for byte.

I'm not slagging anyone off. I just don't understand the cult following this guy has. He came out of nowhere as some sort of spokesperson whether we like it or not. I don't want him to speak for me. He rides on the publicity of the disruptive nature of bitcoin (and obviously is trying to profit from it with not only this book, but with public appearances) but I don't even think he is any sort of "master" of bitcoin. That diminishes the work people such as Gregory Maxwell have done to help bitcoin. Anyway, I am sure I'll be downvoted because I don't worship the almighty Anton, but I will still state my view of him. 
Also, if you check my comment history you will see I've been helping people with bitcoin years before Anton probably even heard about it. Not to boast but I've been involved since 2010 and have helped tons of people at no charge.

Relaying blocks needs to be fast and low-latency, so miners can start building upon the last block. The bigger the block, the higher the chance that miners with higher-latency connections will mine and build upon the incorrect block. This can cause accidental hard forks.
This is completely separate from downloading and storing historical archive blocks.

Missouri Company Ordered To Stop Manufacturing and Selling Illegal Fireworks
JANUARY 17, 2003 Release Number: 03-072
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is announcing today that Max 2000 Inc., of Stanton, Mo., and company officials Thomas and Mary Scaman, have agreed to stop manufacturing and selling an illegal agricultural firecracker that was widely available to consumers. Max 2000 made and sold over one million "Pest Control Report 2000" (PCR 2000) firecrackers that each contained nearly 1,000 milligrams of explosive powder, which is far in excess of the legal limit for consumer firecrackers. These firecrackers, if used by consumers, could cause serious injuries or death.

This is why fees have existed since the beginning. They weren't a big deal for a few years, and that is probably the reason behind people saying bitcoin is ripe for microtransactions or for instant transactions, but that was only a reality for a few people at least a year or 3 ago. Today is different. It is almost what Satoshi said becoming reality. Miners have never been partial to small fee / fee-less transactions. Never! Especially so now.

A 43 cent transaction didn't confirm. This shouldn't be a priority and could almost be considered a stretch when conversing about confirmation times. A few years ago, the standard fee was 0.01 BTC.

You truly are grasping to validate your words. Not only do you twist Satoshi's words to fit your agenda, you outright lie in other circumstances. 
Satoshi envisioned a queue of transactions. They also explicitly stated one can jump the queue in order for your transaction to be confirmed more quickly *if you pay a fee*. This is exactly the situation right now with Bitcoin. 
Miners make money from fees. Miners want more fees. A fee-less Bitcoin is one where miners do not exist. Fees are built into the incentive structure once the block subsidy is decreased enough. Fees already are a substantial percentage of the total reward from generating a valid block. This is the exact situation right now with Bitcoin as it was envisioned, written, and cemented by Satoshi in 2009. 


Yes. Satoshi, when they *enacted the 1MB block limit* to stop potential denial of service attacks on the network. An unlimited block limit is the antithesis to what Satoshi said and did.

Bitcoin Unlimited is an abandonment of the current set of rules which defines Bitcoin, for a new faulty set of rules which centralize mining and fully validating nodes to datacenters, leaving Unlimited vulnerable to state actors attempting to control Bitcoin.

Small blocks take a relatively much faster time to a) propagate to all miners, b) computationally validate, c) start building (mining) upon. 
If miners are to control the block size, they will create only the biggest blocks that no other pools are able to download and validate in a reasonable time, giving the biggest miners an advantage. When this happens, the smaller miners lose revenue and eventually are forced to close shop as it isn't profitable to mine. What is left is Antpool mining every transaction, attempting to force rule changes to Bitcoin, and censoring transactions they (read: the Chinese government) don't like because BitMAIN and Antpool are based in communist China.

LOL. Do you really think people who use Gentoo don't research the USE flags a particular package offers? Good lord. 


This is such a hilarious comment. First of all, Gentoo isn't a distribution. It's a meta-distribution. People who use Gentoo more or less build their own operating system with the set of tools Gentoo provides. 
Secondly, software is built from ebuilds (basically a script which directs Portage to source code, patches, other misc. things). Users define what functionality is included in their software builds via a mechanism called USE flags.
It is more or less impossible to build a functioning Gentoo install without researching and understanding the various USE flags ebuilds offer. Trying to build Gnome without systemd support? Won't work. Trying to build Bitcoin-qt without Qt4 or Qt5? The build will fail. To not understand USE flags is to fly blind when using Gentoo.
Now, on to the - ahem - "blacklists". How is defining your own node policy, by running your own compiled source code, "against software freedom?" 
Don't like the "blacklist"? Just `echo "net-p2p/bitcoin-qt -ljr" &gt; /etc/portage/package.use/bitcoin-qt`

No, because that blockchain is just the same blockchain with added functionality which does not affect nodes which do not recognize the functionality. Also, they can opt-out of using SegWit without all of the risks of a hard fork.
This is how all soft forks have been deployed. You don't have to use multi-sig (P2SH).

Or, they could have done what they *actually did* and release a safe way to double the block size limit. The only people against SegWit are egomaniacs. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:18:01
It's sort of a reverse situation to what we have now. Miners think they control Bitcoin and are attempting to force changes on us. Yet, nodes (read: users) have the ability to reject their blocks. I can stand to wait a few confirms if miners stop mining Bitcoin and start mining an altcoin. Miners **cannot** stand to have their blocks repeatedly rejected. 
By creating a situation where *miners* must absolutely follow the users, less their blocks be rejected and their cash flow dammed, we have a much much better chance at activating SegWit than if we were to rely on selfish miners (who constantly mine 0 transaction blocks). 
Keep in mind the context of the whitepaper with regards to nodes and mining. Every node was also mining. Unlimited would be like starting up Litecoin and mining with that node software. Do you, as a miner, want to stay on the Bitcoin blockchain and continue mining Bitcoins? Then you run Bitcoin software and play by the rule set. Otherwise, nodes will reject your blocks like they're Litecoin blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:15:46

You have the wrong viewpoint here. You can reject out-of-consensus blocks today (and you most likely have already if you were running Core while Bitcoin.com mined an invalid block) and cause other nodes attacking Bitcoin to fork off the network. If you were running Unlimited, you most likely were banned and cut off from the network, potentially causing loss of money for yourself and others (if you are an exchange or merchant).

You need to make it clear to Roger that he is spearheading the campaign of turning Bitcoin into the bastardized antithesis of itself. He clearly is not technically inclined (and that is okay).

This is in line with Erik Voorhees' Satoshi Dice which forced every full node and miner to subsidize his business. This is what these people want: they want Bitcoin to subsidize their businesses. Practically every whiny big block complainer with their panties in a bunch is a head of a business whose business model relies on using Bitcoin (and every person in it) to spend *their time and money* subsidizing them. And who reaps the profit? The businesses. **I** never saw any Bitcoin from Satoshi Dice, even though I mined, verified, and stored indefinitely SD gambling transactions.

Merchants and users are generally the same thing as they both "use" (transact with) Bitcoin, but don't participate in ordering transactions and timestamping blocks like miners do.  What users DO do is check whether the blocks mined by miners are valid by the rules nodes set. If blocks do not follow the rules, they are rejected and invalidated which results in the Bitcoins mined in that block to vanish into thin air (for another miner to generate, if they generate a valid block).
What this means is that miners would be suicidal revenue-wise to mine blocks which are invalid to nodes. The vast majority of nodes running are Bitcoin Core (practically 90%+). If Bitcoin Unlimited miners mine blocks which follow different rules than what Bitcoin Core nodes allow, those blocks would be invalidated. Bitcoin.com (Roger Ver's pool) mined a block which did not follow the rules set by Core nodes and was rejected by the 90%+ of nodes running. This resulted in his pool, and the users of his pool, to lose upwards of $15,000 in mining revenue and wasted electricity mining that block. 
To conclude, miners would be completely stupid and irrational to mine blocks that are invalidated by the network.

That is actually complete bullshit and minimizes the *multitudes* of work done by developers, speakers, merchants, and most importantly it minimizes the sovereignty of individual users who more likely than not bought into Bitcoin in order to escape control by dominant autocratic governments. Your line of thinking needs to be completely stomped out in order for Bitcoin to continue to be a sound money that is not controlled by the things it was created to stop. Miners work for **us**. Users pay the miners. Miners are not our boss.

Shapeshift is not innovative. Some viewpoints would suggest it is, in fact, hindering Bitcoin innovation by easing the flow of money out of Bitcoin and into scams. Money that is not spend on Bitcoin is money that is not helping Bitcoin. If Shapeshift is so innovative, why are there competitor clones? They're just a scamcoin exchange. And they're not even the cheapest scamcoin exchange. 
The innovation (that Erik and SS are faux-supporting) is in Lightning Networks, which just so happen to give everyone the functionality that SS provides, except for free. Whoever these investors are, they are clueless.

No. They do not. All they do there is "outsource" their censorship to their userbase which downvotes practically anything that doesn't promote the following: hard forks, altcoins, bitcoin unlimited, roger ver, theymos hatred, blockstream hatred, core supporter hatred, core contributor hatred. 
You may think "well it's reddit, you can vote how you like!". Except r/btc collapses downvoted comments which renders them invisible without numerous actions taken by the reader. r/btc also limits every reddit user to only a single comment per 10 minute increment. Oh, except users that the moderators hand pick to whitelist, and therefore are exempt from the comment limit.

Then some new developers (current ones, I believe) came along and didn't even implement TOR into OB, thus making it a much much harder to use ecommerce solution for selling your home made socks. You have to be online 24/7 for your store to be visible, you need to buy a VPS to not have people trying to break into your computer because your home IP is visible to everyone, and the UI is buggy. Oh and people will hit "Buy" on your items and then fail to actually pay for them (actually did this to me) which is a huge pain in the ass because OB treats it as a sale but doesn't automatically remove the abandoned sale.

As evidenced by Ethereum, hard forks are dangerous and unforeseeable consequences can arise.

r/btc is the embodiment of everything wrong with reddit. From the censorship to the complete lack of redditquette. Downvotes do not equate to disagreement. Yet, in r/btc they are used to collapse comments and therefore hide them from the general public who do not know how to use reddit. There have been instances of journalists, who don't know how reddit works, taking comments from posts and adding them into articles, while not being able to see the hidden refutations from Core developers. It is active censorship against Core proponents and developers. There is no dancing around the issue. There is more censorship in r/btc than r/bitcoin. Full stop.

Ethereum Foundation failing to stay out of the DAO debacle, resulting in borderline criminal actions regarding investors' funds. Ethereum Foundation involvement in the White Hat Group which tried to steal ETC from users, and had said ETC frozen by exchanges. Ethereum devs willfully failing to provide fraud preventing patches to the hard fork code which resulted in replay attacks between the two chains. Ethereum devs failing to pre-emptively secure various functions in Ethereum programming languages which caused massive delays in transactions and caused the blockchain to swell up to 10GBs per day. All of this resulted in the price of ETH crashing to ~1/2 of what it was during the DAO pump. Oh, did I mention the Ethereum Foundation engaged in promoting the DAO?

Obsolete by what metric? Anything medium to high -end from that era, or even 2-3 years before, is able to work absolutely fine given the workloads of a typical user. My Phenom II 1090t, which I solo-mined blocks with, is still enough for syncing the Bitcoin blockchain or compiling Firefox or Chromium quickly. There is  no need to support Talos for me because my proc has no PSP/IME and still is such an economically awesome purchase that I probably will still use it in 2020. Efforts should maybe be more focused on bringing more attention to these older CPUs which have no PSP/IME because they are ultimately wayyyyy less expensive.

Samson is just saying Lightning is chain-agnostic. It's just a technology, and it can be used to bridge blockchains together (like Bitcoin's LN and Liquid's LN).

They don't purely exist for greater transaction capacity. They exist to extend Bitcoin's features but without affecting the base layer. Liquid for example has faster block times (due to a different consensus mechanism), blinded transaction amounts, and native support for asset issuance. 
Other sidechains can have different properties.
Current tech allows for a trade-off -- those features above while introducing an amount of trust into the system. As long as people are honest about this then there shouldn't be an issue, unlike other projects (Ethereum) which seem to rely on dishonest representation of its capabilities.

The monetization of r/btc is plainly obvious. Look at the sidebar. There are 13 or so links to bitcoin.com. There is an advertisement for bitcoin.com's mining pool. Roger Ver, as a moderator, submits advertisements to bitcoin.com. It's clearly monetized.

It's a wallet app named "Bitcoin Wallet by Bitcoin.com", except in the app they place Bcash above Bitcoin. It's calculated deception in order to confuse people. The whole premise of "Bitcoin Cash" is to confuse people. Look at all of the people butthurt at the word "Bcash" in this comment section. "Bcash" ruins it for them. 
You and others want to trick people into thinking, somehow, that Bitcoin Cash is actually really Bitcoin. But it isn't.

Shapeshift will go the way of centralized Bitcoin mixers. Joinmarket and Tumblebit are examples of Bitcoin tech disrupting centralized mixing services. The same will happen with Shapeshift with regards to Lightning network cross-chain atomic swaps. Why use Shapeshift if you can run your own version of Shapeshift, not pay any ridiculous fees, not have Shapeshift snoop in on your data, and transact in a decentralized manner? 
How long will it take? It's already been done with Bitsquare decentralized exchange. It's only a matter of time before the project improves and more people use it and LN atomic swaps.

Address reuse being a Bad Thing &lt;tm&gt; has not been made publicly announced AFAIK.

I have only heard it from Luke-jr (the aforementioned creator of Eligius mining pool who has since moved on to other things).

From Meni on BCT:


a. There is more forking, meaning an attacker has more effective hashrate. I've ignored inadvertent forking completely in the paper, but it starts being a problem if we go wild with reducing the time constant.
b. There are more blocks, and hence more block headers. For a full node this is negligible but for an SPV (aka lightweight) client this makes a world of difference, especially if it is to be run on weak mobile devices.
So some tradeoff needs to be chosen. It can be argued that 2.5 min is better than 10 min, but it's far from clear-cut.

Full blockchain data rebroadcast is planned. The satellites also rebroadcast the last ~24 hours of blocks in a rolling window. 
Governments (plural) would all have to order shutdowns for many different satellites in order to accomplish meaningful censorship.
You don't need an internet connection to broadcast a tx. There are other means of transmission (SMS, goTenna, etc.).

The satellites Blockstream Satellite use are geosynchronous and don't need expensive tracking motors. Solar panels are also quite expensive relative to the hardware required for Blockstream Satellite, and they wouldn't power a computer with enough computing power to run the software modem for very long.

It's probably better that they are not exclusively owned by Blockstream as that would make the satellites a bigger target. If the bandwidth is broadcasted from hardware *also* used by many other organizations, it increases the political damage caused by shutting the satellite down or otherwise censoring the broadcast.

Well, lots of people can't keep a node synced for various reasons --  they're located in a rural area, they can't afford the b/w, their ISPs are terrible, the govt shut down the internet or filters BTC data. I think that's the largest use case ATM. 
No way to tell really how many people are using it due to sat nodes passively receiving the broadcast, like a car radio. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 19:09:45

@_date: 2019-01-16 19:58:40
The code for Simplicity was just released actually and should make its way to [Elements]( and [Liquid]( before finally ending up in Bitcoin (of course with consensus). 
@_date: 2019-01-16 19:41:13
This is one of the advantages to using the Satellite broadcast. Not only are commercial satellite TV dishes ubiquitous and literally everywhere (so not possible to tell if receiving Bitcoin data or just the local news), the setup is receive-only without any transmitting back. Similar to a car radio. Receiving the data is private, so it's nearly impossible to tell how many people are using the service. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 17:13:12
You cross-reference with data received via other low-bandwidth means. This is one of the benefits of Satellite -- the bandwidth required for downloading new blocks is given to you for free, so that you can utilize your down/uplink for other means. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 23:05:33
That's still a pretty decent chunk of data. 144 * 1.7+MB. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 19:59:51
Yes. Although currently they will need to find a way to broadcast transactions via other means, eg. Mule Tools: 
@_date: 2019-01-02 19:23:39
You can receive BTC, you can self-validate the blockchain, you can rebroadcast the transmission locally, etc.
Mempool broadcast is in the works, too. 
You can use other means to broadcast a transaction (eg. SMS). 
I'm still waiting on why you think the points in the prior comment aren't valid. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 19:47:06
The current bandwidth is on order of 86 kb/s which of course can be upgraded. The satellites rebroadcast the last 144 blocks in a rolling 24-hour window, so if you're behind a bit you can sync up to the tip. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 17:19:22

You see, you show your ignorance. "Leaving your computer on for a very long time" helps secure the transactions that occur in the bitcoin network. The higher the amount of computing power in the network the more near to impossible it is for someone to exploit the network. Sort of like folding with your computer but you help secure the bitcoin network instead of folding proteins. As an incentive to this action of helping securing the network aka "mining" you are rewarded 50 coins if your computer can solve a very very difficult mathematical equation that is verifiable by everyone else's computer on the bitcoin network. And no one in their right minds visits the bitcoin forums anymore. They went to shit months ago. Bitcoin has increased in value 11,000% since last year. I will continue to mine, my good friend. Hell, if you want I'll throw some bitcoins your way just to make you a little more happy since you seem to just be a negative nancy.

The point of the physical coin is that it holds a single private key of 1 btc, and is more easily exchangeable compared to using a computer-to-computer bitcoin transaction which requires both parties to have a computer and at least a LAN. 
Having a coin with the private key printed on it allows you to give them to people face to face and the person receiving the coin can either not peel the sticker off (which is there for fraud protection) or peel it off and redeem it into his Bitcoin client on his computer which he can send to anyone on the internet with for free.

Miners were blocking SegWit on Litecoin. Charlie Lee and Litecoin's users were supportive of a UASF because using Litecoin to play political games was pissing a lot of people off. Litecoin's miners (which are mainly fronts for BitMAIN - like btc.top / ltc.top) did not want a UASF to set a precedent for another much more popular cryptocurrency (Bitcoin). So, they held a nice little "LTC Roundtable" which consisted of miners...and Charlie. In order to allow the miners to save face, he agreed to a "HF" in the future (which everyone knows he cannot do alone and would need 100% community support). Now, we have SegWit enabled on Litecoin and its world has not collapsed in itself. In fact, someone put up $1,000,000 of Litecoin for anyone to try and steal (through "anyone can spend" nonsense). The Litecoin still resides at that address.

Selfishness and tipping do not mix. Do not tip because you want something, such as increased exposure for Bitcoin. Do not tip someone to get something later. Tip only because you unconditionally want to give something nice to someone else.
Tip only when there is a service that was rendered that is of immediate benefit to you. Do not tip out of sympathy. Human emotions are not denominated in dollars or Bitcoins. No one wants to know that you feel $1 worth of sad.
The tip must be commensurate with the service performed and the utility received. No fractional pennies, in fact, no pennies at all. If you wouldn't pick it up off the floor, don't give it to someone else as a gift. A tip that has a low net present value is downright offensive.
And we live in the here and now. No one cares if you believe your measly one ten thousandth of a Bitcoin will be enough to go to the moon some day. Mark it to market.
Do not tip people who work out of love or passion. Do not tip people who are kind to you. Do not tip anyone just for being themselves, especially if they have lived through an adverse event or illness.
Do not tip people whose accomplishments dwarf yours. Keep in mind that when you're behind a made-up username, you look indistinguishable from the know-nothing-did-nothings and loquacious shills that crowd out social media; "anoncryptoman" is the equivalent of a Victorian street urchin -- do not tip from such an account to someone whose real-world identity is known.
Do not tip people who have dedicated their lives to what they believe is a higher purpose.
Do not tip government employees, accountants, military personnel, and financial officers, who need to keep their finances clean of conflicts of interest.
Do not tip judges, doctors, nurses, EMTs, cops, DAs, professors, construction workers, in fact, any professional of any kind outside the service sector.

There's no luck involved in running a fully validating node.

Multiple "big block" supporters admit the debate has nothing to do with bettering the user experience, and everything to do with trying to snatch power over the reference implementation. Garzik, NYA signatories, and SegWit2x make it clear that they will do whatever it takes to force their corporate nonsense on users if it means they can control further development. Funnily enough, Bitcoin was designed to be resistant to this type of attack.

Don't thank me. Thank google for being able to search for cases where coinbase tracks your bitcoins AFTER you withdraw them from coinbase, and will shutdown your account for not spending your bitcoins the way THEY deem appropriate.

The bandwidth is a bigger issue since it takes days to sync even on a fairly expensive broadband connection. Bigger hard drives do not equate to fast hard drives. The last 10,000-20,000 blocks take quite a bit of I/O. And no one wants the blockchain to take up 50% of their SSD. Pruning is a good solution, though. But hey, let's try your way where everyone needs a 1 TB SSD and an i7 just to store, receive, or spend their bitcoin.

The storage isn't quite the issue, but it *is* an issue. The bandwidth required to download &gt; 90 GB of data is a problem as well. Even bigger blocks shrink the number of users due to the more and more expensive equipment required to store the blockchain. If you think fees are a problem then imagine how no one can use bitcoin because they can't store their copy of the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-07-05 18:26:51
Everyone brings up storage as a concern for bigger blocks but the biggest concern is bandwidth. A very small percentage of consumer ISPs could support 8GB blocks. Bigger blocks effectively turns running a full node into the chinese miner situation.

The transactions don't need to be bigger. It is possible to optionally remove the amount blinding. Additionally, more efficient range proofs can bring the size of Confidential Transactions down even further (see: Bulletproofs). 
Keep in mind it is also possible to increase the block capacity on Liquid even further. All without affecting the base chain.

I ran a bitcoin-accepting VPS company for about a year. Bitcoind absolutely bogs down disk IO. When you have multiple VMs running bitcoind, it will slow everyone else down. It has little to do with CPU/RAM resource usage. If it is their policy to not allow bitcoind it could also be because they don't want to be held liable for you being unable to secure your wallet correctly.
