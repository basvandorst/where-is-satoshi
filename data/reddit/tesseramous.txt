how the hell is that the "big picture" when you left out 2011?

transaction volume in bitcoin is kind of an irrelevant figure because it includes mixers, and programs like that mtgox hot wallet splitter.

Coin validation can't work because coins can be transmitted without using exchanges. Let's say a thief has stolen coins and then he sends them to a merchant or sells them to some innocent bitcoin user. Now the bitcoin user goes to use their legitimately acquired bitcoin somewhere and they find the coin is 'blacklisted'. Well there goes the public perception and trust in bitcoin. Then also there are mixers. Now nobody can use mixers because the mixers might (and probably will) produce tainted coins. Coin validation will cause people to move all of their bitcoin activities to going through centralized entities (who do validation) - this will defeat the purpose of bitcoin and destroy the vision of the decentralized user-to-user economy that bitcoin was originally created with.

Someone who is invested in a bitcoin company is bullish about bitcoin?? *You Dont Say*

What will really get you at btc-e is the trollbox. Someone will say something like "buy FTC" and all the sudden you're looking at a near total loss.

Wait he's still trying to get gox back up? I thought gox was over!

This is actually good news.

Another problem with this site is Gavin's faucet donation address prefilled in the destination address when doing transactions. I wonder how many of his 'donations' were actually donations and not mistakes? Why is something even pre-filled in the first place?

When you sell a bitcoin higher than the price you bought it, you are receiving a windfall of USD and making a capital gain. It doesn't matter whether you're trading bitcoin, stocks, tulips, or beanie babies.

There are no details posted about any indications he has that he'll actually be able to open on OTCQX.

China bans profits. Daytraders are only allowed to make losses, at the government controlled exchanges.

Wrong. Pumping bitcoin price with hoarding does NOT make it more liquid for merchants and new players. This is because while you are pumping the price, you are also reducing the available coins with your hoarding. you are reducing the float, so the net effect is that the AVAILABLE market cap and liquidity remains a constant. 
this is just another post from a losing long begging us to rescue him from his position, with no regard for what is actually good for bitcoin
please don't ever again make the idiotic statement that adoption isn't needed and tell people to stopadoption efforts to 'just buy coins'. even if you don't agree with my statements about liquidity, you should never speak against adoption. it is by far the best thing that can happen. It's the only thing that gives bitcoin an actual value, utility, and legitimacy. Satoshi didn't create bitcoin so it could be a price pumping float lockdown ponzi scheme.

When they've already done their analysis and said no, and you ask a second time, it just sounds to them like "I'm a baghodler. Please rescue me."

I'm actualy thinking of switching to trading stocks JUST because they're limited to 9 to 4 on weekdays. Bitcoin trading has ruined by sleeping habits and puts me in a constant anxiety where I can never live in the moment anymore.

How does it help the bitcoin economy and bitcoin adoption if people can't actually use their coins to buy merchandise, trade with eachother, and perform programmable money features?

This is horrible news. I just want mtgox gone already. I thought bitstamp was rallying on its own as a true recovery in a new era independent of gox but I guess I was wrong.
