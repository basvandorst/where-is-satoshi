No, it's because the thumbnail of this post is a dog for some reason...

I'm not too sure what's going on in their explanation of wallets!

The bots analyze the content of each subreddit. After they collect enough data, they'll find what words typically follow a certain word. Then, they randomly post their findings on the subreddit simulator.
This is funny because the comments the bots make really look like some kind of TL;DR of each community!

Who would give you the money and why? You might want to create a fork of the game where everyone would be required to tip a little to play, and then the biggest would win the jackpot after a certain amount of time. But nobody really likes games where they pay to play...
Also I do see a a lot of people called bitcoin in there :P

I guess he's saying the odds are better than the theorical revenue of buying a lottery ticket. Your $2 in BTC will most likely stay around $2 or rise a little, whereas in theory, your $2 Powerball ticket will be worth $1 or something.
Edit: Yes, I am talking about Expected Value, which is closer to $1 than 0, a bad "investment" nonetheless.

B for Billionaires, the two bars for a money sign, it's a pretty average logo any Joe can come up with, really. It's alright if it doesn't have anything to do with Bitcoin.

They're not too rare anymore, I see those popping every now and then on p2p and warez sites

They're already "burned" because they're not moving, and I doubt Satoshi will ever move them again. If he did, the whole price would decrease by a lot.
@_date: 2015-09-09 20:17:03
This is right, however you asked if the price would go up if he did, which the answer is technically no, as they're not flowing anywhere in the market already.

Don't worry, I've received my cryptocard a few weeks ago, about a month after ordering. I was being worried too and contacted them, but they didn't reply. Bet they're really busy...
