You mean cash right? Not land and cars etc..
I mentioned in my post. No paper cash or coins. It's Bitcoin. I don't have to pay rent. Don't use car much. Mostly cycle. Bills and food paid for with Bitcoin to semi Bitcoiners.
@_date: 2015-03-27 18:07:21

Work on it. Get neighbours into Bitcoin atleast make them semi Bitcoiner.
Thankfully I was introduced to local miners and traders so that helps a lot for me :)
@_date: 2015-03-03 10:37:45
@_date: 2015-03-03 07:14:40
Sorry. I have to improve my English. I'll try to explain if you ask me.
@_date: 2015-03-03 10:50:06
Breaking it. Not overnight it will take time. They will have to adapt it.
Speed efficieny Transparency costs contracts and many plus to Bitcoin.
I get asked negative side a lot my answer mostly it is same with cash and current banking. So Bitcoin is no special case as such.
@_date: 2015-03-03 10:57:04
I see a lot people here working on opensource ATM so I don't know.
If others won't build ATM's I think we people only will be able to setup our own Bitcoin ATM's at every local store. People can easily put cash and get Bitcoin and put bitcoin and get cash. It will be locally recycled but volumes will be problem. But this will help mass adoption.
It's best to use Bitcoin everywhere instead of converting. I dream of that time. :)
@_date: 2015-03-03 07:03:31
Bitcoin. The more I learnt about it. The more I moved away from Banking.
Just followed my heart and mind.
@_date: 2015-03-27 18:08:48
Cool, Gonna check this out...
Any option to socialize with Bitcoin payment users? :)
@_date: 2015-03-03 07:10:36
Nothing big a story. You can just call me someone who got introduced to Bitcoin and became a big fan in the past few months.
@_date: 2015-03-04 18:45:34
Yeah you read that right. :)
@_date: 2015-03-03 07:33:08
I learnt adjust with volatility. Spend when it's a few percent above the price of initial purchase. Helps a little for daily stuff. :)
@_date: 2015-03-21 20:08:28
Woah that's a lot of people! Any bankers attended?
India has lots of Banks and their unbanked population is also very high... Any Bitcoin wallets created?
@_date: 2015-03-03 11:54:05
Do you? You mean we the people or Government?
After learning and getting till here. I don't care anymore.
@_date: 2015-03-03 10:41:44

Thankful to those great minds. Though I believe a lot more of Satoshi(s) messengers or children or whatever of divine Bitcoin is needed.
