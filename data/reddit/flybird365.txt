Thanks. I assume that the private address would not be seen unless the coin is broken. If I charge the public address with bitcoins, then I have to totally trust the maker enclosing the private key inside since there is no way for me to verify it. Right?

well? In china, the same news agency that released the central bank will enforce the bank regulation closing ties with exchanges is reporting a new investigation report. It says the enforcement is not strictly enough. The report shows all the loopholes used by the exchanges now. That causes the price down in China.

1. For transaction convenience. Bitcoin addresses are hard to understand for new users. Address reuse not only has privacy issues but also security issues;
2. Do you have  a picture in your real wallet?
3. It's HD wallet. Seed is your private key. When you create the wallet, you back up the seeds. You can always recover all your coins by just using those seeds. There is no need to export private keys.
