ZDnet and TrendMicro recently published an article on malware for sale on the dark web claiming to be able to rob Bitcoin ATMs from the cash in the machine.  
We researched the malware claim and found the offering to be a scam but because none of the blogs bothered to contact us they are effectively helping the scammer with free advertising, luring would-be thieves into purchasing a non-existant hack. The scam here is that the seller of this 'malware' gets free advertising from otherwise reputable blogs (that apparently do not verify what they publish) and the would-be thieves would never report being ripped off because of the nature of the 'product' sold.   
The so-called 'malware' is offered for sale on the dark website named 'Wall St Market'. There are several red flags here:   
The 'malware' seller reputation on the dark-market shows they have never sold any malware before and the account was only created in November 2017. The malware vendor has only sold leaked customer data with leaked banks/credit scoring documents or bank accounts established based on those leaked customer details in the past. As such, this is clearly not a developer that has ANY experience in selling hacks or custom code, just identity theft from oldskool financial institutions.  
Bitcoin ATMs manufactured by GENERAL BYTES have no functionality that would enable dispensing cash prior successfully receiving cryptocurrency via cryptocurrency network or sending cryptocurrency before successfully accepting cash inside of the machine.   
The seller claims "Purchasers of the malware also receive a ready-to-use card that comes with EMV and NFC capabilities". Anyone who has ever used a Bitcoin ATM knows that EMV cards have absolutely nothing to do with Bitcoin ATMs and the NFC functionality is only used to read the destination cryptocurrency address.  
The mentioned engineering menu known from regular ATMs doesn't exist on GENERAL BYTES Bitcoin ATMs and any factory test software doesn't contain any functionality which would enable the ATMs to send coins, accept cash or dispense cash. (For obvious security reasons.)  
Compared to regular ATMs, security measures on cryptocurrency ATMs are lightyears ahead. Partly achieved by the distributed nature of Bitcoin ATMs. There is no central point to attack the machines or network running them.  
There is no such thing as a 'free money admin panel', security audits are performed on a regular basis by the manufacturer and internal source code is subject to peer review and auditing by the white-hat hacker community.  
Unlike regular ATMs, there is a close relation between Bitcoin ATM operators and the Cryptocurrency ATM manufacturer and software is updated multiple times per month.   
We recommend Trend Micro, ZDnet and other media outlets who write about Bitcoin ATMs to contact us before publishing articles like this. This will help them to get their facts straight and will prevent them from turning into an advertising channel for a scammer. We can give any reporter a complete overview on how Bitcoin ATMs work, what is possible and what is downright nonsense.  
We hope to have cleared up this confusion. The article no matter how badly written is being copy-pasted to several news outlets. There is no reason to worry but we felt we had to respond to this.

Incorrect. Only the older machines do not have any AML/KYC in place. All machines produced by GENERAL BYTES after 2013 can be fully compliant with local AML/KYC regulations. Because of constant software updates, these machines will remain compliant for the time to come. Many hate the KYC process but because they are such a visible part of the crypto ecosystem, they need to be compliant or will be shut down by local authorities.

Bitcoin ATMs are still growing in popularity. For an up to date list of locations visit [ and you will be able to lookup rates and availability \(online status\) for most of the machines out there. Yes, they are reliable and usually the easiest way to purchase cryptocurrencies \(not just bitcoin, many more coins supported\)
You will need to use the Bitcoin /  crypto wallet on your phone. To my knowledge no ATMs accept debit cards as debit card charges can be reversed months after transaction took place. \(debit cards can be compared to 0 confirmation payments after months of even a year\) For this reason none of the ATMs on the market will support debit cards, you will have to bring some cash. :\)
Limits depend on local laws on cash transfers, only very few ATMs have no limits and the better models will allow you to lift those limits by providing a phone number or ID card. This is done to prevent problems with the local governments as ATMs are the most visible part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As such, you might have to come back a few times before you will be able to purchase an entire Bitcoin.
Yes, all ATMs will allow you to purchase directly to your wallet, some models will also allow you to withdraw cash from the ATM. See [ for details on the different models of ATMs available.
Hope this answers your questions!

Everyone's account at bips.me got emptied, Kris blames a DDOS attack but has no proof. Even a DDOS attack would not clear everyone's balance to 0.000.

Expect any negative statements about bips.me to be downvoted here on Reddit and once you posted  your concerns about Kris Henriksen on Reddit, he will try and downvote every post you make on Reddit, YouTube, etc. 
I just hope Google will know how to make the link between BIPS.ME and Coinify so that future victims will learn in time not to trust Kris Henriksen with a single Satoshi. 
This post will be downvoted by Kris and his Satoshi stealing friends but at least we warned the community for this very unreliable person.

That's correct. Roughly 25&amp; \- 30&amp; of all transactions are of the Crypto \-\-\&gt; Cash type. The rest \(roughly 70&amp; is cash \-\-\&gt; Crypto. We are in a growing market here and think because of this, prices of crypto will continue to rise.

Yes, it would also end the trolls claiming to have to pay a million gazillion EUR for a bitcoin at that and that ATM. Having live rates will increase transparency and show that we are indeed the best priced ATMs in town.
We will be rolling out these rate feeds per brand / model starting with the GeneralBytes BATM units, then the BitXatm units. No date is set for the Lamassu units as delivery of these has slipped for month after month. :( Very disappointing.

I mentioned this in an email to your colleague Tim. Just read in time, I was ready to order 10 units but found out that no bills larger than 20 EUR are accepted. In a country where all the ATMs spit out 20 and 50 EUR bills this is a serious issue. I understand the updated model will not have this limitation. Does this mean that all those with an existing model are scr*wed as it is a hardware issue? How come you did not notice this earlier on in the design process? Are you that much focussed on the US market and the international market is just an afterthought?
Another issue I have with you not having a European distributor will cause a hefty import duty fine for anyone ordering one of these units. I suggested a local EU distributor and even offered  to become distributor for the EU (MrBitcoin already distributes BTC-O-Matic and General Bytes BATM units at time of writing) but never got a reply back. I guess that is a NO? A simple one word 'NO' reply would have been nice.
Unitil these issues are resolved we will stick to  units as they come with AML / KYC features like fingerprint and photo ID. This, in my opinion is more of a future proof device as we don't know what the regulators will come up next but the BATM units are ready for it. The BATM units are not much more expensive than the Skyhook ATMs and are heavier and therefore harder to steal.
Please reply as Tim didn't reply to my email venting these concerns.
@_date: 2014-07-27 10:28:00
We mounted the ATM so that we did not have to supply an extra  for some of the other Bitcoiners.
More information on the new model can be found here:  and retail for 3000 USD but if you are in the Amsterdam area and know of a nice location that could host one of these ATM units, let us know and we might be able to finance one via the MrBitcoin ATM collective.

I'm afraid it will not always be that way. There are lobbyists busy here in the Netherlands trying to regulate bitcoin as money, hindering or maybe even halting all crypto innovation in the Netherlands altogether. We can not let this happen. Governments should not make laws that hinder or regulate Bitcoin. Bitcoin and other blockchain related technologies are the biggest innovation in decades and have the potential to dramatically reduce the complexity of modern financial systems.

Hello Michael, what number do people call when they have problems with this machine? There is no number listed on your site or on the machine. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 21:21:02


Sorry Token. The idea was to use the subdermal NFC implant as cold storage (savings) and use the phone as a regular (checking) account for Bitcoins. This way we limit risk of theft.
Adding BIP38 support to a payment terminal is pointless as the terminal would decrypt and (possibly store?) your private key. This is very unwanted and insecure. BIP38 is used to secure your savings inside your subdermal implant.
If you want to enable regular Bitoin transactions using NFC, let us know at MrBitco.in and we will be happy to help you on that specific project. As long as your point of sale terminal support either NFC or USB, we will be able to make them contactless.

We will stick with the  units for now. Price difference is not that much and don't want to hack the machines before they are usable. We are in the business of selling ATM units and maintaining a Bitcoin ATM network. Anyway, thanks for the offer, if I would just purchase one as a hobby thing this would have been acceptable but as a business  we have no desire to dust off our soldering iron, the work involved will quickly cause the price to rise to that of a comparable unit that works out of the box.

Hello Curtis,
It allows you to store the private key in BIP-38 encrypted format. The URI normally only takes a public bitcoin address (the bitcoin:1fdsSDREWfsdFSDFSDrewfcsdSDFSDfQ style 'pay me' link but by using a BIP-38 encrypted key instead, Mycelium will now recognize the key as an encrypted private key and will require a password before spending out of it. (as in no chopped off hands or someone drugging you to scan your keys.... )
Note: you are NOT importing the private key in any way. The BIP-38 encrypted key is not written to storage in any way, see  for a demo on cold storage spending with Mycelium.
One step closer. Well yes, the current support is for spending to cold storage and spending from cold storage. Encryption is working and the team at Mycelium is now working on getting Shamir's Shared secret to work as easily as BIP-38 so there are priorities.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:11:37
Correct, and 2 sec to take off. This is much handier, opens my home door very soon, is my ultimate alarm snooze button and of course crypto storage. I tried (smart) watches, NFC rings, NFC cards but think the implant is the best form factor.
@_date: 2014-09-07 16:54:43
We are working on publishing our live rates on the map. This way one can verify our rates and confirm that they are indeed the most inexpensive coin service in town and have developed an API that publishes the live ATM rates for Bitcoin (and also the altcoins) to several ATM map outlets.. :) We like what we are doing and given the largely positive response lately from the Bitcoin community we decided we will be using all of the MrBitcoin profits (made from the small transaction fee) to fund the to be erected Bitcoin Embassy in Amsterdam. This will be a non-profit platform for anyone doing anything with Bitcoin.

We have moved the BTC-O-Matic machine to a new location and replaced it with a BATM Model Two as we feel its compact form factor makes it more suitable for this location.

Our ATMs where mentioned in this article and therefore feel the need to respond here. 
The reporter did not bother to ask us about ATM turnover but the first client was already waiting to use the new machine even BEFORE we managed to hang it on the wall. (!) 
The reporter further claimed the machine was gone. This was only for one afternoon when we moved the ATM to a new location (Cafe Polder in science park) to make room for a different model which we feel is more suited for the venue. (BATM model Two)
The reporter in question obviously had his mind made up about Bitcoin before he started the article. I even mailed him my contact details and telephone, yet he did not see the need to verify his findings and just quoted parts (!) from my email.
The ATM in Lelystad, is.... well... located in Lelystad, only has been around for a few weeks, maybe a month (?) and is setup as a 'pop-up' machine so traffic will be different than an ATM located at walking distance from one of the busiest train stations in the country.
The reporter did not talk to the merchants but to the holiday help at the location. What do these people know about revenue if they only work there part-time? In holland we have this saying that the reporter should have talked to the "organ grinder instead of the monkey"
Bottom line. Don't let this article form your opion about the current state of Bitcoin too much. It's not the current state of Bitcoin in the Netherlands and it is only the view of Jeroen Trommelen on this matter.
To the moon!
@_date: 2014-08-06 10:01:12
In the Netherlands Bitcoin is not money, yes, you can use it as money but technically it does not (yet) fit the definition of money as we know it so is not regulated as such (yet). What the US thinks about Bitcoin is totally irrelevant for us but we do follow the news on the other side of the pond.
We are waiting for a future EU wide regulation but for now, nothing is there. Should future regulations change, we will most likely have to scrap our Lamassu and BTC-O-Matic units (unless software fixes make them compliant) but the General Bytes BATM model two is future proof as it has advanced AML / KYC features that we can use to make it compliant with even the most oppressive regimes. :)

Don't bother. The Skyhook machines don't take any EUR note larger than a 20 for now so you will have a hard time counting all those 5 and 10 EUR bills. We almost ordered one but realized just in time it is useless for the EUR market at the moment and probably irrelevant with the next model once 2-way ATM units start taking over the scene.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:14:01
Same here:  is the ONLY one I know of that has enough space to store a bunch of crypto keys. 888 bytes does not sound like much but for such a small nfc chip it is quite reasonable. :)

A lot of people purchase one atm and think it will make them rich overnight but running an ATM business is hard work and requires skills one might not necessarily have. Being a Bitcoin enthusiast is one thing, being a good Bitcoin ATM operator is something entirely different and think that some people only find that out after unwrapping the packaging. 
@_date: 2014-09-07 11:32:28
No you don't need an ID for most purchases. Let me clarify how the MrBitcoin ATM Network does AML / KYC checks at this moment.
The Lamassu units, BitXatm Sumo Pro models, General-Bytes BATM Model ONE and BTC-O-Matic Bitcoin ATM units in our network do no AML/ KYC, are therefore limited to 14.990 EUR / day and have an hourly limit on the number of transactions. (to prevent abuse and to conform to local laws)
The BATM units by General Bytes Model TWO do not ask for an ID or fingerprint for transactions below 2000 EUR. Between 2000 EUR and 15000 EUR this machine will ask you for a fingerprint. WE DO NOT STORE YOUR FINGERPRINT. Instead, we select 21 random reading points that will allow us to verify the finger as being 'the same person' but we do not know who this person is, just that it is 'the same person'. By doing this we can lift the limits on hourly usage so these units can process far more transactions / hour and still comply with local laws.
Bitcoin ATM units in the MrBitcoin network are usually capped to 15k EUR / day transactions as any cash purchase above 15k EUR will require a ID verification and mandatory reporting. This has nothing to do with Bitcoin but everything to do with the law that states that ANY cash transactions above 15.000 EUR have to be reported, Bitcoin or not. This is also the reason behind the 15k EUR limit on some of our ATM units. By asking for an ID we can have users 'unlock' the machine to lift these limits and buy / sell enough coins to say, purchase a car.
We feel that this is the way we can best conform to local laws and not impose a restrictive regime like other ATM operators. By adding some voluntary verification in Bitcoin ATM units that support it we can lift some of the restrictions local laws put on us. In no way do we ask for identification upfront and always give the user the option to use the machine anonymously (and have in our opinion very relaxed limit imposed) or unlock the machine to its full potential by providing us with some sort of verification.
What do you guys think? Is this acceptable policy? Should we limit the amount  to 15k / day and not ask for ID or allow people to unlock the machines and go over this limit should they need to? Your feedback on this matter is highly appreciated. Remember, ATM limits on 'oldskool' fiat ATM machines are much lower.
@_date: 2014-06-26 08:06:54
We found out the skyhook atm does not accept Eur bank notes larger than 20 Eur. In a country where every ATM spits out 50 EUR notes this model is useless. I contacted the makers (Tim) and he confirmed this is a physical limitation of the bill acceptor and can NOT be fixed. On top of that EU citizens will end up paying a hefty import duty on top of the purchase price as they have no European distributor. For now, one is better off spending a little more money on a BATM machine than this Skyhook device. Sorry Tim, I emailed you about this but got no reply from you back.... 
@_date: 2014-09-07 01:57:29
Yes  but by that time we will have many more locations in an around Amsterdam. Our network is based on General Bytes, BTC-O-Matic, BitXAtm and (a bunch) of Lamassu units arriving (hopefully!) soon.
If you let us know what hotel you will be staying, we will make sure there is one in the lobby when you come over. :)
@_date: 2014-11-21 21:53:47
Correct. except that now the private key on the implant can be encrypted with BIP38 to give you protection against thieves.
Change is sent back to the address in the implant. Once payment is complete, keys are wiped from memory so no traces of private key remain on the phone. Destination address can be anything, not just one of your own keys.
@_date: 2014-11-22 05:03:53
No, but if you tell your friends the Bitcoin in your hand are only of value to you because they are secured and therefore worthless to anyone else then they might let you keep your hands. :) 
Can't see the fad here, Bitcoin implant orders are through the roof at Dangerous things I have been told and with all the turmoil about banning bitcoin in some countries it might be the only safe way to store crypto in the future. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 22:26:09
We used those NFC rings and where not pleased at all. One of the two tags stopped working, on closer inspection the NFC chip came lose from the antenna. Very strange as it had never been exposed to excessive wear or tear. We never bothered to contact them for a replacement as the result would probably be another piece of junk. 
Waste of materials if you ask me. The ring is titanium and would have been better used for another product.... I also found the NFC ring to be really bad / hard / difficult to scan. The manufacturer knows this and instead of fixing it they just supply some stickers you can use to mark the NFC 'sweet spot' on your phone. :(

Thanks for sharing. Yes, it was me who got the implants and am really glad I got them. You can use them to store any crypto, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, etc. but you can use them for tons of other uses too.

Whatever. Let me put it this way. Have you ever tried getting your coins from Bitconic? If so, you know there is no such thing as a 'fast way to get coins online'. In fact, we give people coins or cash in 40 seconds, try that online! Also I must mention that if we need to empty a machine, at the current markup there is not even enough to pay for the gas so please take your fiat to Bitcoinic, spend days to try to get through to their support and beg until you get your coins or..... Pay that tiny markup and you know you get your coins in 40 seconds, get no calls from your bank because you bought Bitcoins at some dodgy online exchange and have peace of mind.
Furthermore... The rate you quote is incorrect and the unit is operating on market rates but a quick look at  your profile reveals that you are a new account purely created to place just this one comment so that makes you some big fat TROLL...

That won't work. You will need something to check for fake bills and really do not want some awkward p2p transaction. ATMs attract an entirely different crowd.

Make sure you are able to run your own wallet! this is not the case with the models linked above. Don't look at the design of the machine, look at the software features as they will either make you poor (stolen / emptied centralized wallets) or rich (own wallet, your own server software, your own fav BTC exchange)
@_date: 2016-12-28 23:12:52
That's not entirely true. I made back my initial ATM investment (4 Generalbytes BATMtwo) units in six months time. Trick is to find locations with long opening hours (as in purchase at 3am when prices are low) and not having to pay for the location. After all, the ATM brings extra foot traffic through the door, uses less energy than an 'open' neon sign and usually attracts a cash savvy crowd.

You're doing it wrong. :) [ Over 2000 ATMs worldwide and you are the only one that has a problem scanning QR codes? I noticed other posts too so assume this is just a troll message and will ignore..

'intentionally misleading'? I am not sure if you understand completely. The ATM shown is a GENERAL BYTES BATMTwo ( and is compatible with a whole range of cryptocurrencies and the two men displayed above just finished integrating Bitcore so there is some reason to party! The ATMs are available in ANY color and with ANY stickering. This ATM will most likely sell Bitcoin in addition to a range of altcoins so there is nothing misleading about it. (Because Bitcoin only ATMs are just ... boring and sooooo 2013) 
Not sure what your 'false advertisement' claim is but they created compatibility with the Bitcore altcoin and that compatibility will most likely be backported to any BATM ATM ever made (1450+ ATMs worldwide) and it will be up to the individual ATM owners to support the coin by enabling it on their own ATMs. 
Hope this clarifies any confusion. BTW: I am sure they will be able to take care of their own asses without you worring about theirs. :D

'get sued to oblivion' ... will not happen. Bitcore... very pink... Bitcoin... very yellow.... Litecoin... very silver... Dogecoin... Many moons... People who do not see the difference have entirely different things to worry about as they will be on the bottom end of the gene pool, not very smart, not nearly smart enough to use a Bitcoin ATM or even spell cryptocurrency without errors... This is not America! Calling all altcoins scams is just not seeing the big picture. Blockchain technology allows for the creation of private currencies for specific purposes, like an electronic version of Disney Dollars and revolutionize payment systems as we speak. Bitcore (from what I recall) was a fork of Bitcoin and any Bitcoin holders got their Bitcore coins via an airdrop. I sold mine, used it to purchase some extra expensive Bitcoin instead but that is a personal choice. Many Bitcoin holders did not care and ignored it. Their good right. Your 'I hope these guys lawyer up' sets a very negative tone. What do you care about someone else their cryptocurrency portfolio? What do you care about the price of a crypto if you purchase some today and spend it within a few hours on coffee, food, admission fee for expo or theme park? There is no 'investment' in that case, just an easy and (inexpensive in case of most altcoins) more modern way to pay.

The ATM above also supports Ethereum but no ERC20 tokens for now because there are no easy to use mobile wallets at this time and there is very limited interest for ERC20 tokens on ATMs at the moment this is not supported and there are no plans to implement this any time soon. However....  If you don't want to wait for GB to create ERC20 support, you will find the github repo here: github.com/GENERALBYTESCOM/batm_public just do a pull request once done and your code will be included (after review) in the ATM firmware.

Have a look at  The fastest growing manufacturer in this space has been GENERAL BYTES, currently the second largest manufacturer. Important things to consider: 
* is support free of charge? If so, for how long? 
* Can you run your own wallets or do you have to 'trust' the manufacturer to take care of this?
* Is the machine capable of selling other cryptocurrencies? If so, which ones? 
You should also consider the requirements from a legal/regulatory perspective. Does your state require a license? What are the fees for this? 
Do you have experience in trading bitcoin? Do you have experience in setting up server software? Have a look at:  and see if your crypto/tech skills are enough. If the videos do not make any sense, you will need someone to help you with setting up and maintaining your ATM(s)
Good luck! Let me know if you have any questions. :)

Check coinatmradar.com for industry stats. Feel free to call GENERAL BYTES at any time, select the marketing option in the voie menu. We'll be happy to answer any questions you might have. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:52:27
All ATMs by GENERAL BYTES ( can submit their rates to coinatmradar.com so the end user can see what the rates are at any given time. It is hard to talk about 'fees' as that is a markup on the source rate and the source rate depends on the source of the coins (i.e. ExchangeX + Y %) Because of that it is better to look at the coinatmradar.com site and view the ATMs from your phone or comfort of your own home and know exactly what to expect when visiting the ATM. (or know when it is down because of limited opening hours.)
Be wary of ATMs that do not publish their rates on coinatmradar.com as in 99% of cases there is a reason why the operator does not want to be transparent about it (i.e. ripoff rate)

POS as in proof of stake? Like the old-school banxsters? Maybe you should apply for a blockchain (not bitcoin) type of job at JP Morgan. I transferred 5k USD today for only 3 cents to the other part of the world. Works fine for me! Bitcoin is King and will remain king but don't take my word for it, MrBitcoin is a bit biased. :P

@_date: 2018-04-25 06:53:26
Absolutely but depends on the manufacturer of the ATM. GENERAL BYTES ATMs support connections to all the major exchanges. What exchanges depend on the coin. In most cases it is preferable to select an exchange that offers the same currency pair as the one you are offering to your clients. \(i.e. BTC/USD, BTC/EUR, BTC/CAD, etc.\)

Added the Bitcoin Neon signs to our site. Not the first ones to do so but at least these are available. Not sure why people downvoted this. Strange as they look rather nice.
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:53:26
Thank you. They are rather nice yes. The retro-neon glow is kinda magical. It is a handblown glass tubing type of neon, not the knock-off neon signs made from a LED strip and that is what gives that super bright light. Like those vintage neon signs in shops but now in a Bitcoin-style. Beats any 'Bitcoin accepted here' sticker if you ask me.

You are comparing apples and oranges regarding transformers. Neon sign transformers supply 6 or 12 kV AC at about 10 to 15 mA’s and are usually high impedance and will sustain a short circuit without burning out. Nintendo transformer takes 100-240v and lowers the voltage to about 12V (?)... 
There is a huge difference between the two. The neon tubing, if just a circle is easy to do but the letters BITCOIN ACCEPTED HERE are actually quite some work and cost much effort to produce, there is a slight difference in each unit as they are hand-made by skilled artisans, not some cheap labour you get off the streets. It costs them years to perfect this skill and therefore it costs time. You don't work for free either do you?
Good luck finding them at the price you quoted. Impossible in my opinion but if you do, please do let me know. :) 
@_date: 2017-05-16 17:13:30
 my favorite but then again I am biased. The live (more or less) marketshare list is here:  do you research, see what the running costs are to keep your ATM supported, any % on fees? Are you running your own wallet? etc. Do your research, google is your friend but this list will get you started. :D

I had a similar problem with my BitXatm at the time in Polder cafe and the other one near the station. Bill acceptor very wonky, after 3 months computer died just after my wallet got emptied by Bitxatm staff. :( This one looks much better but then again, I might be a bit biased. :)
