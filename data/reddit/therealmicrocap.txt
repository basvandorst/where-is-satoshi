You are going to need to show KYC information anyway so why not go with a reputable Bitcoin company like Coinjar.com ?

Great Idea - The guidecontest site. And, yep, encouraging use of bitcoin as payment method is an excellent idea, too.

Oh, no doubt, paypal will get their pound of flesh. But being able to, essentially, seamlessly, move between bitcoin and paypal and vice versa will massively change the cryptocurrency paradigm without a doubt.

Keep in mind, too, that these mining contracts could very well be classified as "Securities" according to the U.S. SEC - Google "Howie Test" to view the elements that, when present, would classify an investment/purchase as a security.
Even if the mining outfit is out of the U.S. they are still probably subject to U.S. Securities laws if they (the mining pool) accept funds from U.S. residents.
Most western countries have similar securities regulations.
In short a security is generally created when:
1) Funds are invested, 
2) with an anticipation of profit
3) and the funds are managed primarily by a third party.
I'm not an attorney, nor do I play one on TV, but, I have had experience with venture capital and securities regulations and it would surely seem to me that these mining pools would be classified as a security and be subject to disclosure, reporting and blue sky regulations.
Just be careful out there.
And, remember, with these mining pools there are NO audited financials and usually no reporting at all, even on an unaudited basis.
As Gavin notes, there potential for chicanery is pretty high..... be careful and do plug in the risk of the mining pool begin classified as a security.

I just think this is so fricking cool.  Just my VERY humble opinion. My daughter was in Paris for a year a few years back. It'll be fun to ask her if she knows this bar

Thanks! Great Chart.  Sure has an entirely different "Feel" when viewed on the log chart.

These guys are on my list for doing business in Argentina. I haven't done any due diligence yet nor reached out to them. 
But, hey, it's a lead for ya!

Wow! Great Idea/Find. Thanks for bringing this to our attention.
I  think I'll integrate this into our advertising community.   
Thanks again rsmoz!

Use the same caution with Paypal. Never put "Bitcoin" or similar word or phrase in the notes section if sending via Paypal.

Could they be trying to say that funds held on behalf of customers can not be invested in the volatile securities? If a coinbase or similar is holding (yes, I know they do not now) funds for a customer, they should be in moneymarket type instruments.
Yes, I read that it says retained earnings, etc. but, the ONLY logical reason for such a restriction, IMHO, is to assure fiat funds held on behalf of customers are not subject to value risk.
But, yes, it seems like a BIG REACH for control of what licensees do with THEIR legally obtained profits.

and I certainly feel for those "needing" higher prices but such shake outs are needed. IMHO bitcoin will trade PRIMARILY on technical analysis because it's a much more "emotional" trade than a stock, bond, currency pair, etc. The fundamentals of business adoption and government regulation and/or indifference will surely drive but it'll be primarily emotion driven trading.  For technical traders.... a monetary wetdream. :)

I LOVE this shake out... this is what markets need to cleanse themselves... build higher bases...  It's painful but this is a good,  healthy cleansing methinks. :)
