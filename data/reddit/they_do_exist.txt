I know that the coin is up dramatically over the past year (from .01 to .24 where it stands now) but I was considering that low from where I think it could potentially go.  Value is relative and I was speaking in relative terms.  If the price of XRP in another years time is $10 we will look back and say .24 was low.  Also,  I'm seeing the errors in my rationale by equating the company with the coin.  I'm going to rethink everything I know about Ripple the company and some of their recent positive headlines and realize that this will have minimal impact on the coin.

If you're investing in Ripple it will be for the tech applications of the company and not so much the currency aspect from what I have read.  They just hosted a conference in NY with some worldwide central banks and just installed an new CFO and brought on a new board member (all with tons of experience and prior success within the financial and business industry) today.  They are trying to make big strides and scale up for sure.  I think Ripple will only be going up but that's just my opinion.  Do some research and come to your own conclusions!

This is interesting. I think a lot of people, including myself, are attaching the company success to the coin success which isn’t the case. I’ll still probably invest a little there just b/c of the low price tag and see what happens. Definitely will be watching for the difference b/n the company’s success and the coin’s.
