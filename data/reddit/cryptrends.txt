It's completely fine and legitimate feedback :) untill now 90% of my time went for creating the website and improve the loading speed and not on content creation/choise
I think you agree and I will work in the next few weeks on changing it.
I'm also looking for contributors 
so if you're up for helping out, PM on telegram:

Can you try to connect from different browser? or delete your cache?
I changed server and in less than 24 hours the site will be connected to CloudFlare
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:05:01
yes :)
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:13:50
I agree! tell it to Hostgator! 
Had shared plan with them and every time i got few thousand of visitors at short time they shut down my site.
Anyhow, I changed to VPS cloud hosting and now it's much better :)
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:26:38
Got you.
And I actually agree.
I removed them. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:06:38
can you elaborate?
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:16:51
I understand you don't like them, me either. I tried not to take a point while uploading information from the official websites of the top 50 coins.
You are not the first person who complains about it, I will remove them from the 'Top 20 Most Popular Cryptocurrencies' category.
People will still be able to find them in 'Cryptocurrencies' category.
If there is another project you think is a scam let me know if many people will tell about the same thing I will consider removing it also.
Thank you for the honest feedback

@_date: 2017-09-03 09:49:00
i agree with you. now we just want to make a tool for traders that help them to understand when it's a good time to buy/sell base coin based on fundumental information.
in order to have a succesfull hedge fund you need to combine it with technical analysis and have people constantly working on improving the algorithm.

do you have whatupp/telegram? lets chat and see how you can help
