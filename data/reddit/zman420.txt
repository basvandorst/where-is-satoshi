Thing is, it's only ~$20 in bch...no big deal to lose that. But if it actually somehow access my BTC account and sends ~$200 worth somewhere unrecoverable, I'll be pissed.  I'll hold off a little longer, maybe contact Ledger themselves.
@_date: 2018-08-23 15:06:39
Well not only the 51% attack (which is a silly name, it can work almost as well with 49% or even 30% of the hash rate), but also implement (or stop) protocol upgrades.
If Bitmain decided that BTC should have 500kb blocks, they could use that power to fork off and implement that protocol update (and kill the minority chain).  They won't do that, but it's a possibility. 
That much consolidated mining power is terrible for our distributed currency. I can't wait until more manufacturers pop up and compete.
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:45:31
I've not done much official experimenting on coin age, but just from experience I've come across situations where attempting to send a 5 minute 'old' coin results in a ~10 hour wait to get put into a block, whereas even just a few hours lets it get included a lot quicker.  Again, just anecdotal, but might be interesting to run some tests and see exactly how age impacts the transaction.  Of course you'd have to try balance all the other parameters that affect the block inclusion time too. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:36:12

Now that the comment madness has died down, let's discuss the actual thread.:P
Note that they are splitting into addresses, not necessarily wallets.  They are probably all part of the same wallet.  I don't think breaking them into smaller chunks would do much for security, because it's unlikely (very unlikely, seeing as its gox) that they would take time to put each of those corresponding private keys into proper cold storage. Especially since they keep splitting into smaller and smaller chunks, and might soon be used to make payments back to the users who lost coin.

Nah, pure removal is the whole point.  I've been begging for mass exodus from mtgox for months/years.  Nothing is going to change by simply moving around a few default settings.  The only way is to make a proper stand and remove them from public sight.
@_date: 2014-02-11 15:07:46


What? Not at all.  I'm simply putting in a request for removing an unreliable/untrustworthy exchange. I don't know how long you've been involved with bitcoin, but if it's been any amount of time it should be obvious that mtgox is a giant wart growing on the bitcoin infrastructure.  They have fucked up so many damn times and are completely incompetent...at least we now have plenty of other exchanges to take their place.  A few years ago we didn't have a choice and they remained popular by default.  The only reason they have stayed successful is because of their volume...move the volume to a competent exchange and everyone (apart from mtgox) benefits.

@_date: 2014-03-08 00:42:12
Why do you need a lot of coins in a hot wallet? For trading?  Assuming you're talking about a hot wallet you control (on your computer, not an online wallet/service), there are lots of ways to minimize the risk.
If you have a fresh install of your OS, limit physical access to that computer, have proper anti-virus/malware software, avoid going to untrustworthy websites, don't click any links that you're not 100% sure about (especially bitcointalk etc, where you may be targeted), keep your wallet encrypted (TrueCrypt), as well as other general security/common sense practices, you should be okay.  The less you actually use that computer for anything other than sending payments/using bitcoin, the better.
At the end of the day, it goes back to my first question. Why do you need quick access to a lot of coins very often? I keep ~1 btc spread between local electrum, blockchain.info, and localbitcoin account as quick access/change for working/testing code that uses bitcoin transactions.  The rest is safely stored until it needs to be used, which is pretty much never, since I made the decision not to trade any more.  I don't think I've had the main wallet online for more than a year...hope they're all still there :P

An interesting experiment would be to create an alt-coin where the requirements are not so huge.  Then you could test out the theory without needing as many resources...and if it works there, you could conclude that it should also work on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-14 10:46:43
It wasn't one of those, no.  It was for a well known site, but she went via google and landed on a clone site which stole the bitcoin.
But that link is a good example - as soon as scam addresses are identified, you could submit them to the service to be included in the monitor list.
@_date: 2017-02-14 10:58:36
Wow, that sounds like a very sneaky bit of malware! I'm guessing you would have gotten it from a very targeted type of attack - e.g. if your gox email was leaked, they would have targeted that (mine was in that list, and I got some attempts too), or possibly from a bitcoin orientated website you visited. No way your run-of-the-mill malware includes code to monitor for bitcoin addresses in the clipboard.  
I agree, non-refundable transactions are at the very core of the protocol, but there will always be scammers looking to take advantage of people who are new to bitcoin.  However, if there's even a chance we can help reverse a transaction, it's worth a shot.

You should be able to import private keys in pretty much any wallet (core, electrum, etc). 
Blockchain.info definitely does allow importing of private keys, (or at least used to, and I don't see why they'd remove the feature).
Did you remove the sticker on the coin to reveal the private key?
Sidenote: If it's not too late already (if you've not yet removed the sticker, though it sounds like you have), you might want to hold on to that coin or even sell it for bitcoin...you'll get more bitcoin for the coin than face value.

You could probably have a script that searches google results for popular bitcoin keywords and detects domains that have very similar css/layout to the official sites. You'd still need to manually check each page before reporting though, and I'm not sure how fast/effective the reporting process is.

Very disturbing.  
Been involved with bitcoin for a long time so grown immune to the typical ups and downs we've had over the years, but this situation is fundamentally threatening the very core concept of bitcoin.
The scary thing is - the problem is centralised mining, which is already here right now.  The hard fork split is just a by-product of this situation.
I don't think POW change is feasible either...it would rip apart our whole infrastructure.  The only possible solution I see to this is another major [ideally not China based] ASIC manufacturer, coming forward asap to de-centralise our mining efforts.
@_date: 2018-10-17 07:10:46
I used to think this as well, but no, the PoW must only solve Bitcoin hashes and nothing else. Doing so would change the PoW motivation/dynamic and lead to security issues.

My sentiment exactly. Been involved with bitcoin for many many years (even used to mine on the Reddit Pool!) and this recent inability to move past the scaling problem is really sad to see.
There is very little technical reason NOT to upgrade to 2mb. It would solve a ton of technical and political issues.  Just fucking do it and move on to better things.

Yes, mining is dangerously centralised at the moment, but a POW change [imo] would be catastrophic for BTC.  It's a very severe move that should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.

I think you're also missing my point that it doesn't matter that there's only **one** Bitcoin. I'm saying that there **two** things calling itself Bitcoin. That doesn't happen very often, and when it does, if it starts creating confusion, it should be dealt with. The best way to deal with it, imo, is in purely technical aspects. 
Then again, I guess maybe nowadays marketing is more important than technology, since a lot of newcomers are not from a technical background and have little interest in actual technical motivations behind decisions. 
Who knows.  It always works itself out in the end anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:49:40
I think marketing and technology wise, it would be very bad. BCHers (and perhaps news/media - looking for big headlines) would be screaming that now they truly are the original bitcoin.  BCH would have the 'original' hashing algorithm, as well as an insanely strong/secure (albeit somewhat centralised) network.
We (BTC) would be left with what - GPU mining? Or another ASIC ready algorithm, but with no infrastructure deployed to actually run it? I think such a huge change in implementation on such an established chain would be catastrophic.
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:04:05
That's just a shitty attitude.
And who gives a shit about accusations and hurt feelings. This post would be about new users feeling more at ease about buying BITCOIN, and purely a factual  technical outine.
If you can't acknowledge that this fork has caused ambiguity for new users, you're being purposefully closed minded.  I've been in bitcoin since near the inception, even mining in when it was created...and I've never seen this kind of pointless straying away from technical aspects to replace the discussion about feelings and ideologies. It's pathetic.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:37:46
I'm not about to bust out a calculator, but
1) Assuming as time goes on, there is more competition in the mining sector (ideal scenario - less centralisation)
2) Assuming blocks remain relativity the same size, and miners only get paid for the on-chain transactions. 
This leaves $X fee per Kb in the block, to be shared between ALL of the miners.  The fees for an on-chain transaction would have to be insane to keep the hash power *growing* (or even maintain it), once block rewards themselves are near 0.
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:38:13

It doesn't matter what we call it. The point is that there *is* a problem. I was suggesting a better way to deal with it than just ignoring it and hoping it will go away.  A 'bipartisan', purely technical, specification of both forks might have helped newbies see which one they consider the 'real' bitcoin, and which one they want to invest into.
If you think newbies going into the other sub are getting conned into buying the other fork coin, then surely a sticky at the top of that sub would cut through the propaganda and help show the facts? And people coming here wondering what the hell bitcoin and bitcoin cash is would also find out the facts.
Anyway, fair enough - your sub, your rules. Twas' just a suggestion.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:51:24


The first word of my original post was also 'Assuming'. This is all a thought exercise/discussion based on assumptions of the future. Like you say - it's impossible to actually predict anything concrete.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:44:03
1) Volume of transactions will rise, but the current scaling proposals to do that rely on off-chain solutions, which will not benefit the miners.
2) Yes, hopefully it will, but assuming we 'peg' mining fees to dollar value, the fee *dollar* value would have to grow insanely big to support the miner's cots/profits.
3) Indeed, renewable energy could be the saviour! As would more efficient chips.
Stupid that I have to say this, but I'm very clearly not a BCHer, (holding both since before the fork though). Been involved with BTC since like 2012.  I think this is a good, and perhaps timely discussion to have though.
EDIT in response to your edit: I'm not talking about the current high fees - yes, those are a byproduct of several unfortunate factors (bad actors, shitty fee estimation in wallets, etc), that I think will be solved fairly easily/soon.

Ooor, we have a bit of compromise and all stick together with a 2mb Segwit Chain, and move on from this scaling mess onto greater things.
I am not for big blocks, but 2mb is not a big block. People seem to be sticking with 1mb out of ideology/stubbornness/egos, and spreading propaganda (on both sides) to gets noobs into their camp.
Like said - Asicboost is defeated. Big blockers have their own chain. It'd be great if people could be reasonable, have some compromises, and work together for bitcoin.
I'm sure as shit not going to hold my breath for the Core chain to succeed if the vast majority of hashing power is with 2X at the fork - just like I didn't expect BCH to succeed when the vast majority of hashing power is with Core.

@_date: 2019-09-11 22:51:42
Not OP but also work in machine learning.
Looks like OP has made either a binary or three-class classifier, so predicting "-1" for price dropping, and "1" for price going up.  The +1 and -1 you're seeing in the plot are simply thresholded class probabilities.  Not sure if he encoded a "0" class for "uncertain" movements.  I'm assuming he's thresholded the algorithm to only "tweet" above a certain [probably uncalibrated] probability, so it doesn't necessarily meet this condition every 10 minutes...hence the gap between some posts.
I agree with others that a more meaningful performance measure should be used.  Also OP probably already knows the performance based on back-testing from thousands of previous events, rather than just the previous 48 hours.  I could hazard a guess that it may perform better than chance for certain time blocks, but is likely very near break-even (loss, if you add trading fees) overall.  I only say this because of the choice of the ambiguous performance assessment being tweeted.  Of course this algorithm could become a self-fulfilling prophecy if enough people 'acted' upon these predictions, but that's not realistic.  Cool/fun bot regardless.

Nice - I've never actually used xgboost. Mostly do SVMs and neural nets/deep nets.
I agree that these markets benefit from being trained on more recent data, however, I wouldn't discard all historic data....there is so much information there that you're not benefiting from.
I'd suggest training a model on as much historic data as you can get your hands on (thousands of samples), and then doing a re-training at runtime as you're currently doing...possibly with increased sample-weights on these more recent examples.  Again - not used xgboost so can't help with the specifics, but in Keras I'd save the large historical training file weights to file, then load and update them at runtime with the latest examples. It's almost like transfer-learning, but on the same domain, just with more weight on the more recent samples. Good luck!

Yeah, I can understand storing part of your stash if you're planning on trading, just be aware that the coins are at risk whenever they are not fully under your control. Even then they're at a risk...but one you can control. 
Also, not that you asked for advice on this but hey, I'd suggest avoiding trading/day trading unless you really know what you're doing and have plenty of experience.

A safe online storage space would be good, but there is always the risk of an attack.
If a bank website got hacked, there would probably be a traceable money trail, but not so much with bitcoin.  Also, banks usually have the funding/insurance to cover any attacks at no cost to the customer, but I can't see a large online wallet being able to guarantee that they can cover any losses due to a security breach.

I guess it depends how you qualify "work hard".  I didn't have to wash toilets or scrub floors to earn these coins, but I didn't get in super early, so mining 45 coins took some effort.  I had to buy sell my nvidias, buy ATIs, set up four dedicated rigs from bits and pieces I could find for free (old motherboards, PSUs etc).

If you're accepting defeat on the data recovery side, you should rip an image of the corrupted drive(s) and upload them online somewhere.  It'd be fun to have a hoard of people trying to recover the data.  Of course without your encryption keys, we wouldn't be able to do much anyway, even if we did manage to recover something.

Nah, the only specific things here are the two (three, including the leading '1') prefix chars and the final three chars.  You can use a regex command in oclvanitygen to generate that fairly easily/quickly.
EDIT: Ah, you're kind of correct.  oclvanitygen doesn't support regex yet, but you can still do regex via the cpu vanitygen.  It'll take a while, but not unreasonable for short patterns.

It's weird though.  I put everything together and it came out exactly as expected, it just doesn't match the public address. I don't know what the odds of me randomly generating a valid private key using the method I tried...but they must be huge.  I'm confused.

That comment makes no sense.


No I'm not claiming that taxation is immoral.  My main problem with tax is that I do not have input on how it is spent.  I guess technically, we're supposed to vote for the people that represent how we want our tax money spent, but the whole voting system is broken, so that doesn't really happen.


You sound as if you're shocked and surprised every time you get taxed.  Taxation is something you know about from childhood and agree to participate in.  
When you drive your car down the road, what do you think paid for the materials, the design and construction, the maintenance, and the street lights that illuminate it?  Tax did.  The same goes for many other things in every day life.  
If you really don't want to participate in the tax system, you could move to a country where they don't have any income tax and subsidise public costs with income from natural resources. How does Kuwait or Saudi Arabia sound?  Even most of those places have *some* sort of personal tax.
You **need** tax, and without it you couldn't have a civilised society as you know it. 
Again, don't get more wrong, it sucks to sponsor the government for the stupid shit like war on drugs and war on terrorism, but at the end of the day, we need the taxation system for basic needs like healthcare and education.

I think the price has stayed at 1btc so that they don't feel like original/early customers got a bad deal.  I'm assuming that the price will update to something more reasonable when they start shipping and start attracting more customers.
As for buying a laptop for $400, I'd still rather have a Trezor than a dedicated laptop for bitcoin.  But I agree, the current value of btc means the trezor is too expensive.  Just don't buy one at the current price - problem solved.

Bitcoin is still a very young technology, with more and more users being exposed every day.  Of these new users, some percentage will want to mine, meaning that AM's market keeps growing.  The more hardware they sell to 'others', the more they will bring online themselves.  It's a great business model with plenty of room for growth.

Yeah you can't feel too bad with a $19k profit!
Here's a lesson for others though - the potential for profit when trying to play the market at these volatile moments comes with risk/stress.
Last big bubble I did a similar thing. Sold a whole bunch of coin on the way down to try pick up some extra cheap coin at the bottom, and then spent hours stressing watching the price rise back up instead.  Luckily it briefly fell again and I managed to buy back in at a small profit, but the stress was not worth it.  Now I just leave my coin in cold storage and don't stress over these price swings.

Overall, I think phones are a great addition to security [when used properly].  Without my Android phone, I would not have an easy way to enable 2FA on my accounts, which would significantly lower security.  Keep backups though, unless you feel like spending your whole Sunday night trying to fruitlessly recover corrupted database files and opening support tickets on various sites to reset your 2FA.

That is my guess.  I think they're playing it right for now...keep the original customers happy by not lowering the price until they need to.  Let this price roller coaster ride finish, and update the Trezor cost when they actually have a product to ship (and hopefully a stabilized btc price to work with).  If the btc price ends up high by that time, give the original pre-order customers something to cheer them up, like discounted Rev 2 product, or another free Rev 1 in X months when original order volume dies down.

Not to get into a pointless argument, but how do you qualify overpriced?  Just by personal opinion? By calculating btc returns based on current/future price? I don't have an asic miner, maybe I would if they were super cheap, but that doesn't mean they are overpriced.  I just prefer to buy AM shares instead of mining myself.
If the hardware sells well enough for the producer to make a profit, then it is not overpriced.  Price is governed by demand, it's as simple as that.  If they were overpriced, there would be no demand and no profit for AM, at which point they would have to lower the price.
@_date: 2013-06-05 16:32:22
They sell a lot more than the USB miner.  USB is just a toy compared to the real hardware they have/sell.

I just put the solution back! 
I had a little panic because I'd accidentally sent the prize with 0 fee and it wasn't verifying. I removed the answer until the transaction was verified so that others couldn't steal it. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 01:40:57
Solution, for those interested:
- Two plaintext sections are both 17 char long
- Base 58 Wallet Import format uses 51 chars total. 17*3 = 51.
- Above means that the key is 3 sections of 17 hex characters 
- 51 length Base 58 keys MUST start with "5" 
- Last part is WUJuRM2WeUaXq4ZrE 
- Middle must be sBsLT85KeowaTBPC9
- Using DES-ECB to decrypt the hex clue with passphrase "Nakamoto", you get a 17 character long result starting with "5". 
That gives me the full key of:
However, that key does not unlock the public address of the riddle.
But, the middle clue is "Nakamoto" in reverse!  How does this come in?  Well, the last clue says that the final section MUST be "WUJuRM2WeUaXq4ZrE", and the first (originally encrypted section) MUST start with 5, so the only section that you can reverse is the middle section!
Final private key must therefore be:
5JW6odHKgHTA9tcga   9CPBTawoeK58TLsBs   WUJuRM2WeUaXq4ZrE

Don't put all of it in, but DO put some of it in.  How much depends on a lot of personal factors, but basically, as everyone keeps saying - only put in what you can afford to lose.  Maybe just buy 1 or 2 bitcoin now, and see where you (and the price) stand in a week?
I'm a strong supporter of bitcoin, but really not in a financial position to invest actual cash in it.

Hmm, I've got a few cold coins sitting doing nothing but was thinking about investing some change i've got in my blockchain wallet.  This nastyfans...how would you ever make money back from it?
From what I understand, they don't actually pay you any profit from mining, only donations?
The last payout per seat/share (paid once a week) was 0.00027138, with a seat/share costing ~0.3 btc.  That's ~1000 weeks to get your money back via donations.  Or is the profit in the expectation that seat prices will go up when/if they get their ASICs?

I didn't downvote, infact, I pretty much agree that taxation is theft.  
But in my opinion, you do need taxation. I fully support 'free' healthcare and education in European countries like the UK.  And there are lots of other things that taxation pays for that is good for society.  Then again, nobody likes to see their hard earned money being 'stolen' by the government, especially if that money is then going to be used for things they don't agree with - like funding wars in the middle east for example.
Liking or disliking taxation models in your particular country is a completely separate topic to bitcoin, for me at least.  I want to see bitcoin succeed, but not particularly because of its tax-avoidance properties.  
However, if I somehow made income via bitcoin and there was a way to avoid losing 20-30% of that in income tax, damn right I would try to avoid that.  I already pay plenty in taxes in fiat.  It's all about balance.

I'm really pleased to see you guys having positive news and becoming a viable exchange.
I was part of the hack contest back when it was Toronto Exchange (thanks for the bounty!), and the website has clearly matured significantly since then.  Hopefully one day I can look back at your exchange and marvel at the times when it was just in its infancy.

Could you possibly post a little intro into how's buying am shares works? How would I do it? I saw btct.co mentioned, is this the best site for that kind of thing? What's the least I can invest? I want to keep most of my coin in cold storage, but wouldn't mind playing around with 0.5btc or so. What are the weekly dividends like? How do you receive them? (I've never done any purchasing of shares, so this is all new to me)

I doubt sky would have blocked every port, just the main ones, such as 80 and possibly 21.  Mining via port 3333 or 9000 or something shouldn't be affected in that case.  
If it is, then you'd have to route all the mining traffic via your local Tor proxy.  A very rough google showed up a result that mentioned a ' --socks-proxy' param for cgminer, so I'm guessing that is possible if needed. 
I'm still at work just now, but if you guys are having issues getting connected, let me know and I can try some configurations when I get home.

Well, it's 6am here and I'm giving up.  I thought I was onto something at one point... that you'd maybe set the password to the coin's ID, so used your verify page to look up coin serials/IDs...but this coin is not registered on there.  
I'm guessing it might be something to do with the National Reconnaissance Office logo, but many attempts yielded nothing yet.

I kinda want a usb miner for me and as gifts, but $69.99 + $55.00 for international shipping, + any customs charges that might get slapped on is just unrealistic for a novelty miner.  
I'll probably wait until the usb sticks go down to ~0.1 BTC in price (eer, $10-$15, who knows what btc will be at that time), hopefully you'll have a cheap/economy international shipping option by then.  I hereby pledge to buy at least 5 when the above conditions are met. :P

Idea: Why not find a reputable charity that would be willing to take bitcoin donations, and send 'destroyed' btc to them?  Publish each charity transaction (blockchain.info link) on your site so that users can verify the recipient.
You get good PR, bitcoin gets good PR, a charity gets money, btc gets exposure to more people that access the charity site and see the btc address/press release.
You could even collaborate with multiple charities, and have the funds from broken deals randomly assigned to one of the charity addresses.  More exposure and different types of charity get to benefit.  
I'm actually working on creating something very similar right now (btc involving charities, nothing to do with btc exchange).

Forget about security, I really don't want to trust any service that they are taking sufficient steps to secure every possible aspect of their system.  Security should not be my concern at all, it should be their concern.
Has your bank system ever been hacked? Probably more often than you'd think, but you never even knew about it, and it was never your problem.
What we REALLY need is a 'bitcoin bank' that insures or guarantees your money, so that you get it back instantly even if they get taken for all the btc they store.  This goes for system level attacks, as well as individual compromised user accounts.  Of course, this service would come with a fee of some sort, but there are some ways around that too.

@_date: 2013-04-26 21:51:08
As I understand it, it all has to balance out.  The difficulty adjusts to the number of people mining, so if people stop because it's not profitable, the difficulty will drop.  As for the fees themselves, they too are adjusted by users as needed to make processing of the transaction efficient.

AM dividends are paid out weekly, and the next one is tomorrow.  It's probably going to be anywhere from 0.015 to 0.025 BTC per share.  I've not done much reading this week about hardware sales etc. so cannot guess more precisely. 
Say each share gets you 0.02, if you buy 2 just now, you'll get ~$4.80 worth when the dividends are paid out tomorrow.  Plus the price usually fluctuates a little around dividend payout time, so you can possibly make some money there too...but I don't bother doing that.

Only kind of. Sure, they started the latest rush, and did put a lot of money in, but so did the rest of the world as 1) they saw china driving the price up, and wanted to increase their holdings 2) the US hearings were positive, and 3) more mainstream press and adoption.
We're a lot further ahead now than a few months ago, even without China.  
People like to panic though, so the price might well dip a bit more, but in my professional opinion, it'll be back up soon.

I'm not sure about it being 'the next big thing', but it was supposed to be an extension for bitcoin that was recently announced to be released as an alt coin instead.  I don't see it competing with btc, since btc is so widely adopted already, but I expect alts like ltc will take a hit when an actual improved/useful alt coin is released.
