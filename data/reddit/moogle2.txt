I couldn't resist jumping into a correction-of-correction-of-correction thread.  He actually meant to type then.  The original comment said "It's probably a lot less than 99%... probably ... 99.999% or something."  While he meant that a lot less of people hadn't heard of it, he then jumped to increase the percentage of people who hadn't heard of it.  Nevertheless, it seemed like he was saying 99.999% was "a lot less" than 99%.
Cafeine then said "A lot more then?" which was technically missing a comma and should have been "A lot more, then?" in order to correct the fact that 99.999% is actually more than, and not less than, 99%.  You misunderstood it as him misspelling "A lot more than..?" which is understandable because people do that too much.  And then your purposeful misspelling of "than" in the "then what" comment confused things even more because he thought you were asking "and then what?" because he didn't realize that you thought he wrote "then" instead of "than" in his question.  Then you both recorrected each other and said it didn't matter.  Then I came and wrote a long few paragraphs for my own enjoyment.
And we all lived happily ever after (unless one of you bought at the top of the bubble).
e: Now he has corrected his original comment, so anyone reading this will be even more confused.

Forget martingale.  *Reverse* martingale is the new martingale!  Each time you make a profitable trade, you double lots for the next trade.  Each time you make a losing trade, you halve lots for the next trade.  It's fool-proof!!

Haha.  Yeah, you wrote that other reply while I was trying to formulate mine I guess.  Oh well, I was just trying to be funny :)
