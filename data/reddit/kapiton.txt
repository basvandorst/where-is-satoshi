Not in the coming weeks. I will have to de-uglify parts of the code and debrand it for that. I will proceed with that in mind though!

I will discuss this with my bank on monday and get back to you :)

It's written by me in Python using Flask.
I'm currently internationalizing the text, will probably be done in an hour or so.
@_date: 2012-04-20 18:29:22
Jag är här för att stanna. :) Du är välkommen!
@_date: 2012-04-21 09:53:59
Thanks :)

Cool, thanks. I'm almost finished with internationalizing the text, so I'll fix it when updating the site to support both English and Swedish (later today). That security write up appears to be overall sloppy, I must've been tired.


If you had somehow gotten hold of a hash and wanted to use a dictionary (or brute force for that matter) to find the correct password, you would have to hash each entry in the dictionary 512 times. On my computer that takes, I think, close to half a second per hash as opposed to a couple milli seconds when using only one iteration. This means each dictionary entry will take 512ish times as long to test. Pretty much the same applies for salting; you have to redo the hashing for each password hash, rather than being able to pre-hash a dictionary and using it on mutiple passwords. Hashing is intentionally made to be computationally intensive, and when hashing passwords it's good practice to adjust the number of iterations depending on how fast computers become. 512 iterations will be enough for many many years though.


Not entirely sure what I meant with that, I think I'll remove it.

Hmm. Skulle gissa att pengarna kommer in på tisdag (eller i bästa fall måndag) om du sätter in de idag.
@_date: 2012-04-20 16:21:26
Thanks :)

Fixed a small bug in /api/0/ticker where it was calling functions by the name used before I reworked the api, resulting in 500 internal server error with no ticker data returned.

Du går in på ta ut och skriver ditt banknummer där. :) Kommer lägga till fler uttagsmetoder allt efter som.

Welcome! Currently I'm internationalizing the site so that it serves both Swedish and English, to support international arbitrage profiteers. It's possible the site will see some short outages or swenglish strings while I sort out the kinks.

Yeah it is indeed high. Thing is it's difficult to gauge the size of the Swedish Bitcoin economy and thus hard to estimate where break-even is. I'll lower it immediately though, and adjust it when I have more information.
[edit] and if you factor in the international transfer fees (compared to bankgiro which is free) it's not that expensive. I've lowered it now though.
@_date: 2012-04-20 23:29:31
Ah, I see. I will definitely consider it.
@_date: 2012-04-20 16:22:54
Good point. Maybe 0 fees if you make trades worth more than n BTC would be a viable compromise?

Enskild firma. Så snart jag har de tillgångar som krävs för ett aktiebolag kommer jag starta ett sådant; är för riskfullt att driva en sån här finansrelaterad verksamhet som enskilt bolag för länge.
@_date: 2012-04-20 20:46:13
Yup,  it's not terribly complete though. If you use it, please report any errors you find :)

Neat project! I have an API that returns JSON (  ), I'll add XChange to my todo list.
