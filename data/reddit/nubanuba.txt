Why are those eating contest winners always so "healthy" body-wise like wtf I have seen the world record dude and he was so ripped.
Before that I pictured a eating competition winner to have the body of a gigantic feminist or something

Oh yes yes, its the random singular people at a reddit forum that are the cause of bitcoin's still not being under mass adoption, not the fact that world population by a large cant barely turn on a computer without thinking theyre doing Einstein's work, noooo, its the evil jimmy replying to r/bitcoin comments! Do you even read what you type?

Socialistas are dumb by nature
They prob confiscated (stole) from some poor souls and 100% dont even know how to make payments with it. Theyll prob learn how to use it and buy some popsicles or something

Some countries in europe like france and deust, also us and canada are so rich they afford to lose trillions without care, even huge world powers eventually collapse if they keep having shit anti-economic politics. French ppl probably produce 1/30 the money they spend

here in brazil its "free"
we pay up to 90% taxes though, and politics are corrupt as fuck

Question though, with lots of miners leaving doesn't that mean that mining could finally become profitable again?
