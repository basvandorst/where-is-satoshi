Bitcoin will be huge in India.  Most venders have such a hard time making change and have to do everything in cash and have it on hand.

I'd love a coin to btc machine.  I got robbed the other day at 9.6% on a machine at the grocer.
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:05:44


Can you explain how that happens?  Just because BTC enters the derivatives game it becomes worth 50 million or that takes time?

Great post, this is a good answer to the scenario I was thinking about.

I was able to set up my account yesterday, but is the issue not being able to purchase?
Ive been stuck in Korea and havent been able to buy since shit was like 12 USD unfortunatley and it pisses me off that it's so hard for me to buy.  Cant send money orders from here, I'm scared as shit to get anyone to set things up for me online or anything too.
Can anyone help me?

I am interested in this for my website!  I may need help to install it via opencart if anyone can help me that'd be awesome.  I know I can do it via bitpay but am unsure of how to go about it. I have trust issues with having someone help me though.
I've been wanting to have bitcoin on there since April when I went live
