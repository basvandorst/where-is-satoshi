@_date: 2014-12-05 23:01:56


I never said I could. 


And, you're absolutely wrong, someone DOES have to prove another's crypto is broken for someone to believe you (what's the point of open source??) bc.info does everything they can to be transparent. That's like saying you might as well not encrypt your laptop because there are ways to get around it. 


OKAY, PROVE IT. jesus. Stop saying how easy it is if you're not going to show me. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 20:10:37
Yeah, good thing btc-e is open source..
@_date: 2014-12-08 17:01:57


Really? They needed the funding to now become more enterprise level. It started off with ONE guy. Do you expect as soon as the funding goes through, that they can just snap their fingers and have professionals instantly hired and create a perfect service?
Fuck, this community is so harsh.
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:24:21
You likely overloaded their API limiter. You should apply for an API key -- it's free and will let you get past this limit. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 17:50:41


Great response. Nothing personal, just impacted consumer confidence. I know that they will win the love of this community back. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 16:48:16
I see a discrepancy in the level of thought for the title of this post, and this comment. Very click-bait-ish.

@_date: 2014-12-08 16:38:54


100% true. And they will definitely reimburse every bitcoin that they can to those affected. That's a given.
I'm just saying that, even with reimbursement, this community will still scream bloody murder to blockchain. 
Blockchain seems like such a cool company, with a great philosophy &amp; way for users to easily transact. But every small action (or lack there of) on blockchain's part is criticized. Everybody here expects perfection in their own way, making it impossible to make everyone happy. 
There is no winning.
@_date: 2014-12-06 01:38:56


BC.info is completely transparent, and they even run [a website]( dedicated to explaining shared coin, and say "Shared Coin can never completely sever the link between the input and destination address, there will always be a connection between them, it is just more difficult to analyse."
I'm trying to get the point that it does its job perfectly, making the transaction extremely hard to follow, leaving only a select few people (definitely not you pal) able to follow it. 


[Haha, okay.]( 
@_date: 2014-12-08 18:12:48
For only iOS users

Must be. Let's go ahead and take this as fact already.

@_date: 2014-12-05 18:40:35




If I make a transaction, right now, using sharedcoin, can you follow where it goes and tell me the address it arrives?
@_date: 2014-12-08 19:28:45

@_date: 2014-12-08 02:24:50
I'm betting the issue will be fixed in less than 30 min. 
However, let's all panic and ridicule blockchain anyways.
EDIT: Haha, fixed in 7 min. The verifier however is still throwing up flags. Panic and ridicule is still on the table.
@_date: 2014-12-08 02:30:03
We need a GitHub for the GitHub so we can verify while we verify
@_date: 2014-12-08 00:14:24


Haha, no thanks. Nice try to Charlie Lee this situation.

By 2 minutes. Does that really matter? I think you need more periods at the end of your statements to get your point across though...........
@_date: 2014-12-08 16:40:28
This will be covered, for sure. But even coinbase/circle/etc. doesn't cover user negligence, which is 99.999% of the cases.

Just curious, why are you looking into switching? 
Have you had any bad experiences personally? Or are you leaving because of the other posts lately?
@_date: 2014-12-07 20:17:56
You can make your own verifier, I wasn't talking about making your own web wallet.

How's that speech going to go??
Step 1: Connect to Private Internet Access VPN Midwest US location
Step 2: Fail to connect to blockchain.info
Step 3: ???
Step 4: Profit.
@_date: 2014-12-08 00:12:32
Panic immediately. Sell all your bitcoin. Obviously the end is near. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 16:06:18
Other than the comment here and the blog post they did, yeah, they're totally trying to sweep this under the rug.
Should get the pitchforks and torches ready? 
@_date: 2014-12-08 16:17:34
The sad part is, this community is going to rip this to shreds and blow this way out of proportion. Blockchain.info made a mistake, they're human. Bitcoin itself if such a new technology, that mistakes are inevitable, but it's the learning that comes from it that is important. Blockchain will take this pounding, and grow stronger because of it.
 Everybody who has had their coins stolen, for whatever reason, will now contact blockchain citing this as the reason and demand to be refunded. 
Even though blockchain is owning up to this mistake with this reddit post, AND blog post, you will get no love. People here love drama. 
I'm sorry for what you've gone through lately blockchain.info, and this came at a bad time. I love your free service, and thank you for all the work that you do.

@_date: 2014-12-08 16:51:29
Yes, because when a mistake happens, usually they know EXACTLY what happened, inform the whole team, and get together to make a coherent release detailing what happened for users at ~2:30 AM GMT.
You forgot your ellipsis.
@_date: 2014-12-07 19:54:46
I know they're ramping up. The updates to come will be candy.
@_date: 2014-12-07 16:58:17
That's why I love this page  that blockchain has. Really makes it easy to make sure what's on their github is what they are giving to users. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 17:52:22
Oh come on, that was a number almost (if not over) a YEAR ago. And they have made huge hires, easy 7 new people BEFORE their series A. Just look at the about page they have.

In addition to what Zahoo said, you can create your own javascript verifier then, the code is open source bud. 
There is no pleasing you.

nope no no no. Not at all. You're missing the function of blockchain.info and how it works.

Even if so, that's subjective, it is not your place to use your admin powers to remove it if it does not break any of the subreddit rules. That's what the voting system is for.


Welcome to society.

[These blockchain.info changes lately, so good](
@_date: 2015-01-05 00:13:26
Man, you went from 0 to 100mph with this. Free service (and one of the few large open-source companies), no attempt to figure out the root of the problem, or contact them, just post to reddit 'fuck them, they're ATTACKING your privacy', you're out. 
You should see [this]( for them attacking their privacy. Compare to circle/coinbase, lol.
Welp, good for blockchain to not have you as one of their users. Have a good new year pal.
@_date: 2015-01-19 22:08:03
I mean, [coinbase multisig is not as safe as you think]( plus the fact that they'll know who you are and how much bitcoin you own.
I like blockchain because of [how the wallets work]( 
Plus, it's fun to launch the app every now and then and oogle at your bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 23:47:41


Well apparently you do, since you made such a hostile post..
@_date: 2015-01-21 18:57:18
Just curious, which rule is this breaking? I don't see it on the right. 
Should we also remove 'coinbase' posts for not specifying the company, over the process that creates bitcoin? Or 'Circle' because it does not distinguish the shape, over the company?
