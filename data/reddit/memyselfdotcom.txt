You may try to show your dad this investigative finnish TV report about OneCoin:
It was done by the finnish public national broadcasting company Yle. Yle shares many of its organizational characteristics with its U.K. counterpart, the BBC, on which it was largely modeled. So it should be unbiased enough even for OneCoin believers.

You can try to argue, that it was done by the non-advertizement driven, public national TV network in Finland, founded in 1926.
So nobody can say the content was produced by any blogger, bitcoin investor, hater, etc..

Ken Labine says that the fake identity blogger using dead guy's picture "will be known as the only legitimate blogger who did real research".
Not surprising comment from Labine, because only scammers can promote a scam.

Excellent Radio documentary by the BBC.
The movie Wizard of Lies was about Bernie Madoff, and the biggest ponzi in the world. 
OneCoin and the Ignatov crime family story is easily "Wizard of Lies 2" worthy. Infact in some way OneCoin is much more interesting and complex in many ways, involving somewhere around million people drawn into the cult like scheme and hopes of getting rich. The story of OneCoin and "the Crypto Queen" is quite extraordinary, and definitely worth listening, although the podcast only scratches the surface really. There's going to be 8 parts in the BBC podcast. But there would be easily material for 800 parts in OneCoin..

You can't sell tokens. You can sell coins but it is very hard. And even if you are able to sell some, lately many people are complaining that money transfers don't come from their Onecoin cash account to their bank anymore.

No. His profits come from his extensive MLM downline. He gets real money MLM bonus from the downline and from every new member he is able to recruit.
Of course he also gets some OneCoins, but his real income come from the MLM bonuses.
