This is BS, sorry.
If you're expecting Bitcoin to be banned on all major jurisdictions of this planet, then running or not a full node becomes the least of your problems. How do you even expect to actually *use* this currency, if everybody is forbidden to accept it, worldwide?
Now, if you're not expecting such an organized effort from multiple government to ban Bitcoin, only perhaps some of the most authoritarian pack, than having full nodes running on people's home is not necessary. As long as you have full nodes on the jurisdictions that are not tightly controlled, that's fine.
That's why I say that Bitcoin is safer with 100 nodes in 100 different jurisdictions, than with 100.000 in a single jurisdiction. The whole strength of decentralization comes from avoiding a single point of failure, and from a legal point of view, jurisdictional internationalization is the best way to build this resistance.
@_date: 2015-06-12 19:10:49
Me too.
But what you mean by "real bank"? Traditional banks are required by law to ask even more information about you. Unless you're talking about physical vaults, which are not practical - and even those can't be anonymous in every jurisdiction.
I'd say multisig wallets could be safer and require less information than traditional banks. But it might be a good feature for them to be able to somehow safely identify the owner of the account.

Normally the limit is on your account not on the particular ATM. The idea is to decrease the damage a flash-kidnapping can cause.
Those with meaningful life savings should transfer them somewhere else (like another country) electronically, not withdraw the whole amount in cash. If they haven't done the transfer yet, I'm afraid it might be too late. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 17:21:00
Don't you realize your "strong army" is not the node count, but the amount of people *actually using* the currency? Like, to pay for stuff and all.
The node count is irrelevant. The Great Firewall of China for example practically killed all tor relays inside the country. That's fairly easy to accomplish for a strong and authoritarian government.
@_date: 2015-12-30 18:13:19
well, that only up until the Bitcoin network can't handle the payments anymore. Then Bitpay &amp; CIA will have to start accepting some altcoin instead.
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:49:09
But what's the point? If it's illegal to use your currency absolutely everywhere, you won't be able to buy anything with it. Even black markets would stop using it, since they also want a form of money they can exchange for non-illegal goods and services.
@_date: 2015-06-17 08:29:05
The potential of increase a miner can cause by bloating his own blocks is proportional to his hash power. That's not something you need to worry about. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 19:12:59
Ok I hadn't thought of this. You cannot create fake transactions, but you can omit existent ones. Good point.
That would allow the node lying to you to make you believe a double-spend is valid. You'd never see it confirming, but you'd trust it to be valid. That's bad.
That could theoretically be countered with some particular protocol messages though. Assume you have at least one honest peer. When you receive the double-spend attempt, you forward it. I don't know how peers behave today, but perhaps there could be a rejection message saying "hey, this is a double-spend, invalid due to this previous transaction", sending you the transaction that was confirmed before and making the double-spend obvious to you since you can now put that transaction under a particular Merkle root somewhere in the chain.
Do you see any problems in this approach?
@_date: 2015-06-30 10:21:22
I believe these services hold a fiat balance for you, that can be promptly converted from and to Bitcoin. So it doesn't make sense asking if you hold your keys in this context. You must check things like the financial health of their banking partners, the jurisdiction etc. It's like a fiat offshore bank account.
@_date: 2015-12-30 18:16:27
Wake up. This union you ask for not only is no longer possible, it's not even desirable. Blockstream &amp; CIA are turning Bitcoin into something else. They're turning it into a SWIFT 2.0, and that's not why I "subscribed" to Bitcoin in the first place.
The community needs to divorce, and each group follow its own path.
@_date: 2015-06-19 09:03:06
Stable or even slowly diminishing supply is irrelevant. Money circulates. 
Increasing value adds to the real interest to be payed by the borrower. If you know your currency is expected to increase no more than 5% in value for ex, you add that to your real interest rate. 
The main problem with using Bitcoin as a debt unit of account right now is that its value is too unpredictable.

The reason is gentlemen. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 18:25:17
I meant more like your money.
That might become a reality for Bitcoin companies, and for a good reason. People are not always capable of securing their wallets properly, and that's when multisig wallets can be very useful. You set withdraw limits, and even if a hacker gains access to your account, he won't be able to withdraw more than the limit. But to recover your access or change the limits, the wallet operator might need to positively identify you as the rightful owner. A recovery e-mail might not be enough, as the hacker may as well have gained access to your e-mail account.
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:22:59
Where did you see people more concerned about storage than bandwidth?
We can very cheaply have more than enough storage for multiple times the entire blockchain. It's far from becoming unbearable.  And I'm talking about archiving nodes here. The option of pruning is already there, making it even cheaper.

Dude, I'm an anti-state libertarian myself.


Are you saying libertarians are the ones trying to cripple Bitcoin? Because that's not the case at all. This is coming mainly from people incapable of accepting spontaneous order like Peter Todd for ex. People who think top-down rules are necessary for Bitcoin to succeed. 
Libertarians are normally on board with not having a cap at all, and let configurations that allow miners to set tolerance levels against other miners' blocks. That's the most free market solution to this problem.
@_date: 2015-06-07 07:18:15
If politics keep preventing the necessary changes for scaling up, we can only hope some alternative is picked up. Lots of momentum would be lost though if we have to abandon bitcoin for something else.
The good thing is that if it happens, the alternative could not only be scalable, as it could also have interesting features like those ring signatures for privacy etc.
@_date: 2015-06-15 23:11:20
Oh sure, a global payment network capable of processing no more than 3 transactions per second (perhaps 7 if we completely drop all secure stuff like multisig) is not crippled at all.
PS: I don't know what centrally administered checkpoints you are talking about. This is not necessary to raise the limits. Although if you're going for a hardfork, perhaps implementing something like that "cementing" concept (was it you that coined the term? Sort of dynamic checkpoints?) might not be a bad idea. I'm not sure it's a good idea to allow a multiple days reorg even if somehow somebody managed to produce such a larger chain.
@_date: 2015-06-27 12:24:28
Libertarians tend to understand economics, and by so, they normally understand that for Bitcoin to be useful to mankind, its price will inevitably need to rise. Somebody thinking that Bitcoin can be meaningful and helpful to mankind while keeping a crippling limit on the rate of transactions seems to have some problems with logic IMHO.
@_date: 2015-06-28 01:34:09
I'm not aware of capital controls being imposed in Cyprus. All I now is the big bail-in that happened in two banks. Were there capital controls?
@_date: 2015-06-02 11:16:42
HI, yes, that was me. :) If you're into old threads about this subject, there's this one too: 
You can see the discussion evolving there. In the beginning I though an automatic adjustment was the best solution. After some interesting discussions with another bitcoiner in Prague (it was with the creator of that first weusecoins video), he changed my mind and I now I believe we shouldn't have a hard limit at all. A combination of configurable soft limits and configurable "tolerance levels" would be enough to avoid huge blocks being thrown around (like you say that you might accept a block larger than X if it's already N blocks deep, otherwise ignore it). That would be the most decentralized, "free-market" solution to the problem.
Anyways. I'm sad and tired with all this debate. To me it's so obvious the limit must be increased. I knew it was going to be tough, but I couldn't predict that the reason for this difficulty would be so much ridiculous lobbying suggesting that a crippled Bitcoin that can only be used by banks (like a SWIFT 2.0) is better than an actual currency usable by everyone. The kind of arguments being used by those who want to keep Bitcoin crippled, damn, I would never have imagined those!
@_date: 2015-06-15 22:44:37
Sigh.... I didn't expect this from theymos and the others responsible for bitcoin.org.


Seriously theymos? You actually think the opposite can happen? A "vast majority of the Bitcoin economy" will remain with this crippling, unscalable blocksize limit?
Damn this fucking limit that should never have been created in the first place. If bitcoin.org only acknowledges the crippled version of Bitcoin even after the fork, this will cause enormous confusion. People will not understand why the software they download at bitcoin.org doesn't work with the coins they just bought at some exchange. This will be messy as hell. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 23:10:45
Why?? Why waiting the fire to start to then throw fire extinguishers at it? 
The only explanation that comes to my mind is that you intend to keep claiming nothing wrong is happening even after we hit the limit and it starts blocking adoption increase. After all, how can you quantify the amount of people that doesn't start using Bitcoin because of that? 
@_date: 2015-12-08 17:49:36
I don't understand how these IRA and 401k work, but percentage wise, do you pay so much to take the money out of there and invest "normally" in Bitcoin? Because this premium is very high. Like, 33% higher or so... even if you have to give up a decent chunk of the money you withdraw in taxes, that will still allow you to have more Bitcoin in the end... and you'll be able to store the coins much more safely and privately than letting them with an official financial institution.
@_date: 2015-06-30 13:52:10
Although there's pretty much an empirical truth in what you're saying, that doesn't necessarily has to be the case. Imagine if Bitcoin were to collapse. Most bitcoiners don't hold their entire wealth in Bitcoin, so, even if they were to lose some money, they wouldn't lose "all their money" (assuming money = wealth).
The same thing could be true to any currency. You don't need to hold all your wealth in one particular currency. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 13:55:08
Questionable is an understatement. Peter Todd seems to be actively working to break Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-07 07:10:01
Besides hardware wallets as the top comment says, it's also important to distinguish between shared wallets and multisig. The latter are much more secure and as easy to use. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:36:07
If it says 0% network propagation it's basically stating nobody else besides your wallet knows about your transaction. Your transaction has not been sent to network, and this way it will obviously never confirm.
You should contact blockchain.info's support.
In the meantime, to verify if it has been sent or not, try to verify if your transaction appears in any block explorer other than blockchain.info.

@_date: 2015-06-10 21:52:20
Exactly! You don't need ordinary people to be able to run full nodes. Bitcoin companies, pool operators and some researchers or others doing out of good will is already enough, provided they're scattered around the globe. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:33:26
I'll repeat myself. If you are afraid governments worldwide will get together to ban Bitcoin or somehow choke it to death, then the blocksize is the least of your worries. The number of full nodes is irrelevant if the usage of Bitcoin is forbidden everywhere.

Oh come on. The Greek government is not making any of these. They still spend more than they collect! There's absolutely no austerity there. There would be some austerity if they were having something like a 5% surplus, which is still modest when we look at their massive debt.

Sure, if you have lots of bandwidth at your disposal, you can attempt a DDoS. Actually, many major pools have already been DDoSed by botnets. They had to put themselves behind strong ISPs, capable of protecting them.
If an attacker was to attempt a large scale DDoS against *everyone* on the network, not only he'd need a good amount of bandwidth, he'd also have a hard time hiding himself. He could eventually be found and legally charged. But yeah, I guess the only protection "ordinary nodes" (not pools capable of paying for the strong ISPs) could have while a major DDoS is on is to hide behind Tor.

There's no need in "bringing the community together". The two different visons for Bitcoin are irreconcilable. We must not force these two groups into one single vision. A divorce is needed. Let's just let it happen peacefully, and that will be better for everyone. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 11:33:58


Yes, that's the conclusion I got too after discussing with people. Soft limits + tolerance levels. You can configure sets of *(size, depth)* parameters, meaning you'll only build on top of blocks larger than *size* if this block is already *depth* blocks deep.
This is the most decentralized, "free-market solution" there is. Anything else is, like Gavin already said when he cited Hayek, a "pretense of knowledge". Even trying to come up with an adjustable formula, although much better than what we have now, would still be a "centrally planned" solution.

Hi. You ask what I think about this block extension thing?
I just arrived at the topic and don't really have much of an opinion. It looks clever in how it avoid the politics and pushes everything aside of the main chain in a way that would not impact those that don't want to join. Might be the best approach after all. It can be done right now, without asking anybody's permission/agreement. 
But damn... looking at this, doesn't it make you think of all these "hacky" things that with time were added on top of old, "written in stone" protocols like SMTP? Never change the base protocol, just add things on top of it via complicated hacks, all because backward compatibility. That's what I was kind of thinking of when I mentioned SMTP in my bitcointalk post that you linked above.

I really don't understand why the eurozone is waiting so much to just disconnect Greece from the common currency. Do they really expect Greece to pay their debt?
Or is it just because they don't know how to properly react when the default comes? It's true that if they simply accept the default, that would set a horrible precedent. They should kick Greece out of the block when the default comes. And perhaps that's complicated, since AFAIK there's no provision in EU legislation of how to kick a member off.

If I may make a suggestion, try to simplify your UX by moving the choices displayed for price and lock time etc to an advanced tab, that doesn't need to be configured unless the user wants to. Having to choose these values yourself might spook some users, and bring doubt to most others (I'd have no idea of how much to charge/pay for ex.) Ideally the client should guess the values by observing the network.
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:29:54
If you want to fully validate it, 0 trust etc, then yeah you must first download the entire thing and only then proceed with pruning. I believe BTW the existent implementation of pruning behaves this way, somebody please correct me if I'm wrong.
But AFAIU you could theoretically download it already pruned. That's very safe as the only way to lie to you would be to construct a valid block, PoW-wise, just to be able to build a fake Merkle root with fake transactions. Without performing a Sybil attack on you at the same time, for that to succeed the attacker would need to have &gt;50% of hashpower, otherwise the honest miners would overcome him and you'd see the true chain. So, to summarize, if you want to download an already pruned chain, just be sure to add some trustworthy nodes to your peer list manually, in order to avoid a Sybil attack, and you should be fine. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:06:49
He would need hashpower for that.
@_date: 2015-06-20 13:54:28
TIL. Thanks! :)
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:52:29
That's a good remark, but please remember that you only need a single honest peer to receive the full correct data - and be sure that's the correct data.
If such an attack was to be attempted, eventually people would realize and some sort of "trustworthy node list" would pop up. Clients could then ensure to, at least, be connected to some of these trustworthy nodes. I know it looks like you're adding some level of trust to the system, but it's not such a big deal: you'd just be adding some trusted nodes to your list, but you'd keep the existent bootstrap and node lookup mechanisms.
And even before such list is compiled, the range of damage that could be done is limited, AFAICT. The attacker would not be able to create a fake chain. He could refuse to propagate transactions, basically "muting" a good chunk of the network. But he would not be able to double-spend or steal anyone, and it would be just a matter of time before the attack is countered.
Edit: When I said double-spending I was thinking about confirmed transactions. It's true that unconfirmed transactions become more insecure, at least while the attack is not countered.
@_date: 2015-06-17 08:30:44

And as Mike Hearn has very well argued in his blog post "crash landing" or something, it's quite debatable if Bitcoin would even remain alive to become an important settlement system if the limit is not raised. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:05:41


Well, in some ways it might. For ex., by knowing who you are, they might be able to safely give back to you access to something that you lost to a hacker. They'd need to make some identification to be sure it's you though.
But yeah you do have a point. It's better if they don't need to. In the case of ShapeShift, they definitely don't need personal data, so it should not be required.
@_date: 2015-06-08 07:39:33
No he was being sarcastic. But that's kinda the argument of those wanting to keep the crippling limit. So that everyone can run a full node, only bank-like institutions would use the chain for big settlements. You'd be able to run a full node, but not really to transact in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 11:24:10
Really... people who oppose bail-ins are not really thinking it through. This is the best way to handle a bank failure.
There are basically three ways to handle a bank failure:
* Bail-out: This is certainly the worst. Taxvictims are forced to save the bank, regardless of whether they had any relation with the failing bank or not.
* Bankruptcy: Better than bail-out IMO, but well, if you're a customer of a bank that breaks, be sure you'll lose money.
* Bail-in: Similarly to bankruptcy, but with the difference that in this scenario those who lost money are supposed to receive shares of the bank in proportion to how much money they lost. The previous shareholders lose everything, and the creditors who were defaulted upon become the new shareholders of the bank whose balance sheet is now on the blue.
A bank failure is obviously something bad, but I can't see a better way of dealing with it than bail-ins.

A complicated system to warn nodes about double spend attempts could be created, that would inevitably have to come with more security like KYC, cameras for physical transaction so you can identify thieves etc. Yes, all that could exist to try to catch eventual double spenders.
But, insofar, such kind of theft (double-spending 0-confs) is practically not happening. Retailers can safely accept 0-conf. And that's in great part because miners, who have an interest in Bitcoin's success, do not implement RBF.
What Peter Todd is doing is equivalent to going around town yelling that his neighbor has gone in vacation and left his house open, while at the same time even providing appropriate tools for wannabe burglars. This is just wrong.

Even when pruning you keep the block headers, which contain all the PoW. Transactions are linked to Merkle roots which are present in the headers.
So, to make fake transactions, the attacker would need to make fake Merkle roots, and consequently fake headers. But if we assume the attacker doesn't have more hashpower than the rest of the network (safe assumption), his fake headers would always be of less PoW than those you'd get from honest peers. The only way for the attacker to perform this would be through a Sybil attack, i.e., preventing you from receiving any data from anybody else. Such attack is easily countered by making sure you're connected to at least one, preferably more, honest nodes.

This limit will soon be hit, and congestion will likely start even before. You know this already. And you also know that nobody on "your camp" has any concrete solution to present right now. Gavin has. 
What's the problem for you, Peter Todd &amp; CIA to simply let the limit be raised by a constant multiplier (20 MB) and then gain a few years for you to work in whatever fancy solution you think will be better, and actually have something concrete to present when we start reaching the new limit?
@_date: 2015-06-14 18:47:14
Limits are interesting to miners because miner X doesn't gain from processing large blocks from miner Y. Ok it would allow you to gather more fees, but it also allows other miners to generate bigger blocks for you to store and index.
Edit: and BTW, milk quotas? WTF? Is there any jurisdiction actually limiting the amount of milk that can be produced??

Possibly, but this will be very confusing to newcomers. People will be googling bitcoin, and for quite a while they'll end up on bitcoin.org. They'll download a wallet that's no longer compatible with the coins they're buying on exchanges.
This will be messy as hell.
I'm trying to imagine what might happen. Perhaps a bubble will start again. This will cause strong congestion. BitcoinXT will be rushed into production to increase the blocksize limit. The "Bitcoin should be just a settlement network" crowd, now including those in charge of bitcoin.org, will not recognize the new scalable Bitcoin. The confusion this will cause will likely pop the bubble, bringing us back to where we've started (if not lower), and settling us behind a couple more years. Sigh... Let's hope it doesn't go this way.
@_date: 2015-06-23 13:47:22
I see some people already told you about pruning so I won't say anything more on this subject. I just wanted you to understand that the most delicate resource concerning Bitcoin's scalability is not really storage, but bandwidth. This is what's more scarce so far.
But to let you a bit optimistic, think about this: Bitcoin bandwidth usage is growing exponentially because Bitcoin usage per se is growing exponentially. But Bitcoin usage can only grow so much (like, it's "capped" at a theoretical maximum where everyone on the planet is a user). Once usage stops growing, bandwidth usage will also stop growing and will stay linear. OTOH, bandwidth availability has been growing exponentially for decades and there's no reason to believe this trend will change.

That's why I think the real decentralization measure is not the node count per se, but the amount of different jurisdictions we have full nodes running in.
Bitcoin would be much safer with 100 nodes, each in a different jurisdiction, than with 100.000 nodes, all in the same jurisdiction.
@_date: 2015-06-04 11:05:14
I don't see why the median is better than the mean for this case. On the contrary actually, the mean is probably better. Each block should have its influence on the calculus.
Imagine for example 73 blocks are 1Mb and 71 blocks are 10Mb. The new max would be only 2Mb. The previous 144 blocks wouldn't even fit in the new 144 ones. You'd be totally ignoring all the other 10Mb blocks. Every block should influence the calculus. (I know the example was extreme but it makes it easier to illustrate what I meant by a majority group changing things on their favor)

Why would GreenAddress benefit from a crippled Bitcoin? I know they want the blocksize to remain, but I never understood their motives. As a multisig wallet (AFAIK), I'd say they'd have more to gain if more people could use Bitcoin. Their transactions must happen in-chain. It's true that the very concept of "green address" becomes handy when you simply cannot get your transaction to confirm quickly because congestion, but still, their user base would be much smaller.

You could as well ask for the remaining branches in order to fit that transaction you just received into the branches you already have (if any) of the Merkle root for its block.

It's normal that the growth rate approaches zero. It was growing freaking fast. Now that most miners already have ASICs (if not all of them), growth will be driven more by the price than by hardware progress. And as the price has been quite stable for a while, so should be the hashrate.

Thank you for this video, it's very relevant.
There's a non-neglectable chance that an altcoin could do the same to Bitcoin if the blocksize limit is not raised. Feature-wise, some altcoins are already superior to Bitcoin, and some of them have already handled the blocksize limit problem better. The privacy features some of these altcoins carry are very interesting and powerful. Actually, I wonder, is any privacy altcoin being used in darknet markets already or is Bitcoin still king there?
Bitcoin is still king in the cryptocurrency world because of network effects and everything they bring (a much larger ecosystem, more developers, more investments, more companies, wallets etc). But if Bitcoin can't be allowed to grow and congestion comes strongly, well... people might start switching to altcoins. 
The hardest thing is to know which of them.
@_date: 2014-09-01 09:14:06
You're right in that there's nothing ethically wrong with it. But I'd be more satisfied if the system somehow made such blacklisting technically impossible. It would render the network more robust, IMHO, and so it would accomplish its goals more efficiently.

This is a great comparison, but let's be honest though: it's not a really comparison of WU vs Bitcoin, but a comparison of an entity which has to abide by multiple international regulations on the left, and free-market on the right.
Had all business and wallets receiving and sending bitcoin need to adapt to tons and tons of international regulations, their forms wouldn't look much different than the one of WU. They'd might be even worse.
At the same time, if these invasive regulations didn't exist, WU would probably be able to transfer money quite easily, just asking destination account and amount too. 
EDIT: What, of course, reinforces the fact that one of the main advantages of Bitcoin is being difficult, if not impossible, to regulate on the protocol level. Let's never forget that and always denounce the stupidity of asking for "more regulation in the Bitcoin space".

That's not what I was saying. Taxation, particularly the worst forms of it like income taxes, may one day come to an end. I'm just saying that Bitcoin as a technology probably won't contribute much to that particular goal. Other technologies like seasteading or "telepresence" (don't really have a name for it, but basically a more advanced version of the technology Charlie Shrem used to attend that conference) might be more effective there.

Besides pleasure, it can also change businesses too. Your jurisdiction doesn't allow you to hire foreigners due to stupid anti-immigration laws? No problem, bring a robot instead! Oh, and since you'd be paying a foreign legal entity for the service, no labor laws would apply either. The possibilities are really uncountable. I used to say Bitcoin, Seasteading and 3D-printing were the "under-development" technologies with the most liberating potential. Well, after seeing how Charlie went to the conference while at house arrest, I just realized I must add "tele-presence" (or whatever this is called) to the list!
And let's not forget the advances that are being done on the field of prosthesis.  People can already build robotic arms that can be controlled by the human brain, and some of these arms are already capable of sending "feedback feelings", that is, you touch something with your robotic prosthesis, and you *feel it*. How long until we're capable of fully transferring the entirety of our sensations to the robot, and instead of packaging the Swiss chocolate and mailing it, you just "eat it" on the spot - and don't even get a gram fatter! :)

You get the contract done before sending the money (and obviously the contract should state that the transfer is necessary for its validity).

States could still exist without taxation per se. The most defining characteristic of a state is the jurisdictional monopoly it exerts, of which you can't secede and declare sovereignty. Theoretically, such monopoly could be sustained on fees charged on services you require. You would be charged proportionally to the amount of services you require from the monopoly. Although still unfair, that's not taxation.
All that said, I don't know a single example of a modern state that operates like that.

I am stunned to see so many people here thinking this could be viewed as "good news". Business will have to pay double GST on Bitcoin transactions if they sell their coins in Australia! That's a showstopper! It's almost like trying to ban Bitcoin usage as currency in Australia, sort of like what the Chinese gov did, but with nicer words. 
Business will be forced to sell their Bitcoins abroad if they don't want to pay double GST. But then they'll need to receive the fiat money via wire transfer. I've read some posts here claiming wire transfers to and from Australia are quite expensive (capital control?). 
If merchants (i.e., if payment processors) can't find a cost-competitive way around this double-GST thing, Bitcoin usage as money in Australia will be effectively banned, although officially "allowed". Obviously, under such conditions, it will only be used as money in illicit transactions. And then it will be even easier to paint Bitcoin as the money of criminals.

I'll copy here a post I've written to another guy who was sort of asking the same thing  (what's the point of bitcoin if it's not worthy to buy stuff with it):
Perhaps to you particularly, Bitcoin-the-payment-protocol is not very useful. But Bitcoin-the-commodity is something with good potential to any investor. Risky, but with potential.
First, think about all the use cases where Bitcoin might be disruptive and particularly useful. Falkivinge four drivers might be a good read, starting [here]( 
Then, remember Bitcoin supply [grows asymptotically]( (=&amp;gt; capped): 
While *any fiat* currency out there grows exponentially (=&amp;gt; limitless). Actually, even physical commodities like precious metals have their supply growing in pretty much an exponential way. Take the [USD monetary base]( 
Or the [EUR M1](  (change the dates on the chart to have a good view over decades)
Or even [gold supply]( 
I hope that gives you a hint on why some bitcoin might be good for your savings, even if you don't intend to use it as a means of payment right away. 
And, I hope, in the future you will be allowed to have part of your salary payed to you in Bitcoin, making it even more convenient as a means of payment, considering the discounts that most merchants will be offering thanks to savings on CC fees.

The resources to build these "health measures" would never be available if it wasn't for industrialization. It's not a coincidence that mortality rates started falling right after the Industrial Revolution. Before, practically all human effort had to be spend to produce the most basic items for survival, and frequently that wasn't enough. Industry made us much more productive, what made us richer, what made us healthier.

I don't think this price fall is only due to inflation. Of course it contributes, but there's more to it, otherwise the aggregated price ("market cap") wouldn't have changed much. This is just me guessing, but I think one of the main reasons is that, since it's now so much easier to spend coins, many people who have invested in the past are realizing their gains by spending them. They were probably just waiting for the opportunity.

I don't know anything about Justcoin. IMHO, the second best option after cold storage (hardware wallets included in "cold storage") are multisig webwallets, with 2 factor authentication. Is Justcoin such a wallet? Normally exchanges are not multisig because they must have full control of your money to fulfill your orders.


No. Nothing personal against them, they're making a terrific job. But they're not a safe place to store your money. No webwallet with full control of your money is, and that's the case of Coinbase.

Even if they're transparent and 100% reserves are ensured by math, they could still be targets of authoritarian regulations and/or financial privacy violations, pretty much like banks are today. Not to mention account freezing, payment embargoes and all that BS. I'm a strong supporter of the idea of every individual being his own banker, and that's perfectly possible with Bitcoin, why not promote it?
BTW, I already know Peter Todd arguments, and I simply don't agree with the premise displayed in that site (can't watch the video here where I am now) that only big, non-anonymous datacenters will be able to handle a full node. Quite on the contrary, I agree with what was said in an article of the Bitcoin Magazine once: within 20 years, people will be able to run full nodes in mobile devices. The reason for this is that a full node resource consumption only grows exponentially right now because Bitcoin usage is growing exponentially. But there's only so much people in the world willing to use Bitcoin. This growth will stabilize one day. And when that happens, resource consumption will stabilize too (in what concerns bandwidth) or grow linearly (storage). Hardware progress, OTOH, will keep growing exponentially as it has always had. Here in the town I live people can already have optical fibers in their homes, with more than a 100Mbps of actual bandwidth available. Imagine within 20 years!

To run a solo miner you must be able to store the entire chain, and keep up with all transactions. So, even if the proof-of-work was no big deal, you'd still need a significant amount of storage and bandwidth. I guess a raspberry pi would handle it if plugged to a external storage media and network.
Now, if you're participating on a mining pool, you don't need to run a full client with the entire chain. Under this configuration the only serious resource you need is hashpower.
Is that what you wanted to know?

That's what Greenaddress.it proposes. If you trust greenaddress not to double spend, you can identify and accept any transaction coming from their wallet as good without waiting for confirmations.
The problem with the concept of green address (and here I'm not talking about greenaddress.it particularly) is that your receiver needs to trust the third-party. There can be many third-parties, you can't expect ordinary users to manually configure their clients and set the ones they trust and the ones they don't. It's pretty much like SSL, soon we'll end up with something like PKI for green addresses. Clients will be built with a hardcoded list of "trusted green addresses".

Read this: 
You need much less than a supercomputer to process Visa levels of volume. All this drama is nonsense.
And btw, the most important resource is not even computer power, but bandwidth. Bandwidth usage is proportional to bitcoin usage, which currently has been growing exponentially. But bitcoin usage can only grow exponentially for a certain time. There's a sort of "limit" to such exponential growth (i.e., all monetary transactions done on earth). Once usage stabilizes, so will the bandwidth requirements. Available bandwidth OTOH, will likely keep increasing exponentially as it has ever been.
In 20 years time it will probably be possible to run full nodes on mobile devices.

Seriously OP, people have said over and over again: don't leave your coins at a wallet fully controlled by its operator!
If you don't want to set up an offline wallet yourself, than at least look for multisig options, there are more than one available now. In these wallets the control of your coins is shared by you and the operator. The latter can't run away with your coins without your consent, not even if hacked. And even if 'you' are hacked (difficult with 2F-auth), withdraw limits would prevent you from losing significant amounts of money.

Good point, you're supposed to pay VAT on things you import. But that's somehow overlooked. Where I live you just pay if they catch your package on its way to your place. :) Nothing will happen to you for not declaring it in advance.
But yeah, if they were to enforce that, it would be almost like a ban. I dare saying that, depending on how strongly they try to enforce it, it could be considerably worse than NY's BitLicense.
EDIT: Just remembered, private individuals are not expected to pay VAT when they sell things among themselves, are they? So at least person-to-person exchanges would not be affected. Such exchanges are too limiting though, they don't scale, nor can they be automated, something that's fundamental for payment processors.... and payment processors are essential to most merchants... :\

Well, for a start, you could recognize some green addresses. Funds coming from those could be deemed safe as the sender has no way to double-spend (you should trust the entity guaranteeing the green address not to double-spend though, which is mostly fine as they'd have no interest in it)

It's a different kind of wallet. Coinbase controls the keys, so they're basically like a traditional bank. They can take your money, freeze your count, start demanding stuff like documents as ransom before releasing the money, send your money to "authorities" and so on. Blockchain.info OTOH gives all the private keys to you, they supposedly have no access. The danger is that if you get hacked, you may lose everything.
The best solution IMHO lies in the middle: shared control (multisig) + withdraw limits.

If the answer is no, then I'm afraid you're wrong. Treating Bitcoin as a foreign currency or financial asset would exempt it from GST, and thus cancel this double-GST overcharge of merchants who take bitcoin as payment.

IMHO, what's happening is that people are trying to sell their coins for fiat in order to withdraw fiat from MtGox. AFAIK, Bitcoin withdraw is totally suspended while fiat withdraws are still going through, albeit with huge delays.
It's pretty much the opposite reason for why MtGox's price was higher than other exchanges not so long ago. At the time Bitcoin withdraws were flowing normally while fiat was jammed.

You know that one of the most renowned austro-libertarian scholars of our time argues that ancient monarchy would be a less authoritarian regime of government than democracies? And his arguments are quite good. You should read his own texts for a decent description of the arguments, but the tl;dr is basically two points:
 * Kings are "long-term parasites", while democratic leaders are "short-term" ones. Kings see the kingdom as their property, and will avoid to damage it too much, so that it can keep benefiting him and his heirs forever. Democratic leaders have only their terms to extract everything they can, and that tends to make them much more destructive.
 * In democracy this illusion that "we are the government", that anybody can be there etc makes the subjects much more prone to accept abuses. While in monarchy the distinction between the host and the parasite is much clearer to everyone. People tend to tolerate abuse less.
I'm not sure whether I agree with that, since we have counter-examples in our world: Saudi Arabia and North Korea (which technically has been an absolutist monarchy for three generations). OTOH, there are prosperous monarchy-like places, like the Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain (the religious authoritarianism that exist in these places is IMHO unrelated to the government system). But I wonder if the success of these last ones is not much more related to their small sizes (or decentralization in the case of the Emirates), and the jurisdiction competition that small governments suffer.

Yes, it is part of the protocol. Changing it changes the protocol. That's why it's not easy to "fix".
And the bigger Bitcoin gets, the harder the politics around it gets. There's a large and loud number of people who are currently fighting to keep this crippling limit on the chain. The more time passes, the harder it gets to reach a consensus. I'm not sure we can reach a consensus anymore, we'll probably have to go through and actual chain fork what will be very, very chaotic.
Not wanting to blame him, I admire him a lot for what he's done, but had Satoshi implemented a better, scalable solution instead of a hardcoded constant right in the beginning, this would not be happening. That's why I say it was his worst mistake IMHO.

Define "bitcon",
If you're talking about the protocol, I have a hard time finding a "flaw". The only thing in the protocol I'd call a flaw is the hardcoded block size limit. Since I've first learned about it I started saying we should get rid of this thing the sooner the better, and now it's already a bt late. The amount of politics involved in making the decision is already high, and I wouldn't be much surprised if, when the time comes and we start bumping hard on that limit, a hard-fork will be necessary, two different chains would survive, producing chaos and bad PR.
But we'll survive it of course. Actually, a hard-fork with two surviving chains is a bit pessimist... I'm sure everybody wants to avoid that.
Besides that there's always room for improvement. For example, sidechains would be great. But that's not a flaw.
Now, if by "bitcoin" you mean the entire ecosystem, then of course there's much more room for improvement. Strong security against data theft and lost is still the major point IMHO. We're already seeing some multi-sig webwallet what's great. But cheap hardware wallets would be great too. So far we only have Trezor (to my knowledge), and it's quite expensive.

How can they be? They were long enough to change people's skin, hair and eye's colors. Why wouldn't it be the same for other traits?




Not really, he does mention it. He even explains why things initially developed in the Middle East, Mediterranean (Greece, Rome...) and in parts of America and Asia. There's a equilibrium to be reached. If the environment is too harsh, it will slow down population increases, what will decrease the chances of the outbursts you talk about. It will make people's life "too difficult". Up to the point that even agriculture and husbandry were not an option in these super-harsh places for a longer time. Even if people there were intellectually capable of developing the techniques.
Recheck the text carefully, he mentions this. The paragraph that starts with "As well, the theory can explain what may at first appear as an anomaly"


You may count these inventions as predecessors to the Industrial Revolution, no problem, that does not invalidate his theory. Why these developments happened there, and not in the Amazon region? The same explanation can be applied. (that was actually my initial point in bringing this text up, since you were talking about things like the discover of cholera)


Ok, I give you that. :) Perhaps he was thinking about jungles only? Or, doesn't this passage mention prehistorical times?

What does this add in terms of decentralization? I mean, even if you amass enough donations to deploy 1000 nodes, in what way would it be better than a single one?
Since they're all controlled by the same entity (fullnode.co), in what concerns the main advantages of decentralization (censorship-resistance, difficulty to shutdown etc) they end up working pretty much as a single node to me. Actually it might be even worse, because if you get lots of donations, you end up having larger "power" over the network to, for example, decide what to relay, or even orchestrate sibyl attacks.

I would argue the opposite, decentralized (profit-oriented if you will) justice would be  less prone to corruption, due to the simple fact that there could be some accountability. If it's found (or just suspected) that a voluntary court is favoring those who pay larger bribes, people can simply stop using that court. When a monopoly (state) does the same, you have no alternative to run to. 
Besides that, there's also the superiority of the decentralized "common law" system that would be born out of it, the better efficiency of a voluntary enterprise etc.

Proper use of the payment protocol could easily solve item 1. The problem today is that both sender and receiver connect themselves to the p2p network, and communicate through it. With all its hops, sometimes it may take a while for the transaction to reach the receiver terminal. If instead they also communicated directly (bluetooth, NFC, wifi, whatever), the sender could send the signed transaction immediately to the receiver. Both would then forward it to the network. But the receiver would see the transaction immediately, and if there's no major risk of double-spend (true for most retail transactions), the payment is set.
Concerning item 2, yes, there's still some long way before these security measures are implemented in ways that people can use easily. As you say, never before files could be so valuable, and at the same time held by non-experts in computer security. The infrastructure is yet to be built. But it's getting better. Hardware wallets will soon be available, as well as multi-signature techniques.
Same thing goes for your last item. Infrastructure is yet to be built. It's perfectly possible to have consumer protection, it just won't work the same way it does today for Paypal and CC (with everybody being forced to pay in fees the costs of such insurance).

Oh boy, here we go.
This is insane. Australian merchants accepting Bitcoin as payment would have to pay double-GST (I'm assuming GST==VAT). That makes it impractical for Australian business to receive payments in Bitcoin. Unless they "export" all the coins they receive to get an exemption of GST. Does the Australian government force individuals to pay GST on things they import?
Even if such "workaround" of always exporting one's bitcoins to avoid the double-taxation is doable, that will add considerable hassle to the act of accepting Bitcoin as a merchant in Australia. If payment processors don't find a way to make it much simpler, while keeping their costs competitive, these rulings will end up being similar to those of China: you can buy and sell this thing, but dare not use it as money!


Yeah, right.

They can't counterfeit indiscriminately, and it can be tracked back to them, who could face serious charges (using fake payments to steal is a crime!). They could lose their multi-million investment, and there's simply no way that would pay off. Against what would they exchange their fake payments? What would be worth that much? How would they hide after acquiring such a valuable amount of assets in exchange of this fake payment?
Seriously, double-spending for profit via a &gt;50% attack at the current difficulty is simply not viable.


That's an absurd comparison for the reason I've outlined above. The damage of hyperinflation is incomparably worse.


That's the only real risk I fear, when talking about the &gt;50% attack. I don't see a profit-motivated entity doing it, as such an attack would ruin their profits. But a politically-motivated entity could, perhaps. (i.e., somebody that can force somebody else to pay for the attack).
There are techniques that could be used in such eventuality to try to counter such attack.
In the particular case of this mining pool, it would be suicidal of them to do so. But yeah, the simple fact that they can is worrisome. What if they happen to be hacked, for example? The hacker could eventually freeze the network for a few hours or even a day or two, and that would be awful (although the banking system always close during weekends and nobody seems to lose their hairs over this).

People are suggesting sidechains as a scalability solution. But if everyone is plugged on all sidechains and handling all the load, what's the point of these sidechains again? It's not about mining itself I'm talking, but the processing and relaying of all transactions.


If sidechains are being used as a scalablity solution, you'd have to do "main-chain settlements" every time you try to transfer money to another sidechain.
I think the idea of those claiming sidechains could help on scalability is to create sort of "regional sidechains". They'd not be global as Bitcoin. At least that's what I understand of it.

Well, prices, specially in contracts, are one thing. What you use to effectively pay for stuff is another thing.
For example, I know that in Brazil only BRL can be used in contracts. But I know a person who once sold a house (= officially documented sale) and part of the payment was an expensive car. The car market price in BRL was used in the contract, accepted by both parties.
So, what's the case in Ukraine? Can you barter - and thus, use Bitcoin in payments? Or must every commercial transaction have actual UAH (or legally accepted substitutes) on one side of it?

If that's so simple, why isn't it happening already?
That would be criminal, as you'd be facilitating fraud. You could have issues if caught. 
Honest miners could also counter-attack by simply not forwarding transactions to this pool, or even refusing to build on top of blocks built by this pool.
And although I do recognize there are lots of crooks out there, I still believe most of humanity does not want to facilitate the lives of fraudsters, even in exchange of a little monetary gain (for example, how many people flee a restaurant without paying? That's fairly easy to do with almost nil chances of bad consequences, and does imply in a little monetary gain, but most just don't do it). I wouldn't expect such rogue pool to gather a significant chunk of processing power.

I obviously don't have data to back it up on the top of my head, but I risk saying most governments do avoid wars (with other governments), and have been successful in doing so for many decades. The US is really the biggest exception in today's world. Perhaps because it happens to be the most powerful military in the world right now.... historically, it seems the world always had some sort of military empire threatening everybody else at some point.

Having to pay VAT on the sale of bitcoins would force every exchange of bitcoin x fiat to happen outside of the EU. Merchants that need to convert bitcoin to fiat would have to export the bitcoins they receive from their customers in order to declare VAT exemption on their sales. Private individuals willing to sell their bitcoins would need to deal with either foreign or undeclared exchanges. No declared exchange would survive in the EU, they'd all be pushed to jurisdictions that don't charge this tax.

I wonder when will it be possible for exchanges to be fully integrated with a bank, meaning you'd have your own IBAN at the exchange, instead of sending money to the account of the exchange. The account would be on your name. This way, this kind of censorship would only be possible if the sending bank was willing to censor the receiving bank entirely, something that could be too much if we're talking about a general purpose bank.
The way they do it today, with the exchange having a single account where everybody deposits into, makes it to easy to censor.

I thought the amount of stake was just the amount of coins. That's deterministic. But then, if the set needs to get too big for one to have a large percentage of coins "voting", then I guess the signature might become way to big too, and create huge resource usage making it impractical... or not?

Your spam would only be as powerful as your hash rate, because you only get to include free spam on your own blocks. If you have, say, 10% of the hash rate, you'd increase the block size only if the other 90% are already struggling to keep up with actual demand. Eventually, when transaction fees become a substantial part of mining reward, filling your own blocks with spam will come at a cost too.

As I said, this has been largely debated already, you'll see more than one solution on bitcointalk.org
I support the usage of configurable soft-limits, no hard-limit. Miners could have "levels of tolerance", for example they could refuse to build on top of blocks larger than S, unless this block is already N blocks deep. S and N being configurable. Miners could also publish their limits to make it easier to reach a consensus. 
But a self-adapting formula for setting the limit according to the demand is also a possibility. Something like periodically changing the max limit to 1.2 times the median/average size of latest blocks. Sort of how difficulty is handled today.

Every PoW chain is vulnerable to a &gt;50% attack. The only difference is that merged-mining allows it to easily have a good chunk of Bitcoin's hashpower. But it also makes it easier for a pool operator to attack the currency, as Eligius once did to an altcoin. So it's a choice. Saying that they necessarily need the passive approval of most bitcoin miners is not necessarily correct, that was my point.

An insurance is (supposed to be) a voluntary contract. You'll voluntarily choose your insurer, which on its turn has the incentives to ensure you minimize your risks.

Unavoidable/uncontrollable events have consequences in the supply and demand of products and services. If the supply/demand of something changes, the price of this something must change accordingly, so that the correct signal is passed to market agents, in order to coordinate the consumption and production of what's most needed.
Trying to avoid that is like trying to forbid prices to go up after a natural disaster for example. Price controls only bring bad consequences.
Plus, monetary creation is not neutral. When new money is created, this money is not immediately and proportionally distributed among all holders of the currency. Some people receive it first. These people (in our current world, banks, governments and well connected corporations) will be benefited at the expense of those who receive the money last. It's a disguised wealth transfer.

That's not what was interpreted not only by me, but by many others. Their text says something like "GST is payable on the supply of Bitcoin".


I think you're mixing things up. Yes, business may use their input GST to get a credit, but this credit is on the GST they pay for the goods and services they're providing. To have an input credit for the Bitcoin they're selling at an exchange for instance, they'd need to use the GST theoretically payed by the customer who sent them those coins (the customer is the supplier of coins). But individuals are not direct victims of GST, so such input credit becomes impossible. Bam, double-tax.

Where? I'm not aware of a single government which has ever implemented it.


Then all the other 91% should be able to easily log on to a website and change their vote. This (overwrite your delegate's vote) must be an easy possibility, obviously. And eventually a percentage of these people would change their delegate too, if they were that unsatisfied. You should be able to change your delegate at any moment.
Another important point for liquid democracy to be effective is not to have a Parliament at all. Anybody who wanted to be a delegate should be able to, this should not be a full time job payed by taxvictims. So, basically, if you don't want to get involved in politics, but you trust your "smart cousin" enough to vote for you, delegate to him. As Mike describe on his paper, delegation could also be based on themes. For example, everything concerning education you delegate to the principal of your children's school, everything concerning technology you delegate to your geek brother and so on. The ideal is that the average delegate only represent a few dozens of people, not more. This could dramatically reduce delegate's power. Plus, people would probably eventually realize that they are insignificant on larger votes of millions of people, but their voice is better heard on small votes of a few thousands: that would push to actual decentralization of power, more things being decided on the local level instead of federal/national level. Eventually even full autonomy or secession.
Obviously, for all this to work, things would have to be done via the net, remotely, and something like a smartcard or even like Trezor (dedicated hardware) should be used for authentication.

I haven't read all &gt;300 messages, but as usual, people focus a lot on Bitcoin the payment network, and not on Bitcoin the currency.
Okay, Bitcoin is a great payment network, but its advantages for users on that use case are not 'that' strong, plus, there's no reason why some centralized system couldn't also be much cheaper, faster etc. That's not the greatest advantage of Bitcoin. (with the obvious and notable exception of those markets where Bitcoin's pseudonymous nature is a game changer)
The greatest advantage of Bitcoin for investors is the fact that in a few years its monetary growth (inflation) will be insignificant. There's not a single fiat currency out there whose issuer is so restrained. Many people already invest in foreign currencies. One of the main criteria you should take into consideration when buying foreign currency is how prone the issuer of this currency is to use the printing press. Every fiat currency grows in exponential curves. Even precious metals grow in exponential curves. Bitcoin grows in an 'asymptotic curve'. On the long term, the difference is enormous.
It's silly trying to sell bitcoin as a way to buy stuff. Okay, Bitcoin is kinda good for that, but not enough to motivate people to even look into it. People will buy Bitcoin as an investment. And then eventually, once they already have some, they might just spend them somewhere instead of selling it, since after all it's so easy to spend. So, besides trying to make Bitcoin so much easier to spend, we should be trying to make Bitcoin much easier to buy (invest in). The "infrastructure builders" should now be looking much more attentively to payroll companies than to merchants. ;)

The paper is basically saying that the randomness which is used to pick who will be the block signers is not really random and can be skewed. At least that's what I understood.
The thing that bothers me is that he says as if that was a general rule, not an implementation flaw. I always believed that, if a proper RNG algorithm is used, any number could be a seed and the results would be  fairly random, or at least hard to skew on one's favor. Trying to pick a seed to generate a specific sequence should be computationally as hard as trying to brute-force a hash or something. Sort of a one-way function. Am I wrong? Is it computationally easy, for every RNG algorithm, to pick a seed that will produce an arbitrary result?
EDIT: Actually, just thinking a bit more. Even if RNG algorithms can be skewed like that, wouldn't it suffice to use a good hash as seed? Since hash functions are one-way and by the mighty powers of cryptography we can trust one cannot feasibly come out with the specific hash result he needs for the RNG algo to generate the specific sequence one wants, we can rest assure the attack described by the paper is unfeasible.
I'm willing to call BS on this paper... unless some patient person more knowledgeable than me could show me where I'm wrong.

Value is subjective, each individual, at each different point in time, will value 1 bitcoin differently.
The *price* though, is set by supply and demand. So no, I disagree with your premise. It's true that many people accepting it is probably an indicator that many people want to hold it, but what pushes the price of bitcoin is not acceptance per se, it's the good ol' hodling.

Months don't have exactly 4 weeks. A difference between monthly and weekly or daily payments is that week and days always have the same length, months don't. If you're payed a monthly salary, your work is valued more in February than in March. Doesn't make much sense to me, the only explanation for monthly payments is trying to decrease the hassle/cost of making the payment. With Bitcoin it could be all automated and cheap.

I haven't read the whole thing, but I'd like to know from those who criticize the idea behind bail-ins, which better solution do they provide? To my understanding, bail-ins are much better than the traditional bankruptcy process, and both are much more fair than bail-outs (i.e., forcing taxvictims to pay for it).
AFAIU, in a bail-in the following things will happen:
 * The shareholders of the broken institution lose everything (like in a bankruptcy)
 * Creditors will lose part of their claim. Ideally, this should start with creditors which agreed to taking more risks, like bond holders. Depositors should be among the last to be touched, but all riskier-creditors were not enough to cover the losses, the eventually depositors will lose something to.
 * Every creditor receives an amount of stake in the restructured bank. For example, if you lost X$, and 100X$ were necessary to save the bank, you now own 1% of it.
This looks a better solution to me than bankruptcy because the creditors will probably receive something more, and the company won't need to be liquidated, as in bankruptcy. In a normal bankruptcy, depositors would probably lose much more.

Holders increase the demand and thus the price, so yes for the first question.
For the second question, things are a bit more complicated. The amount of debt in the current world is way too huge. For the bitcoin monetary mass to get anywhere near that in aggregated price, it would need to grow so much that it could only do so by "killing" many other currencies (hyperbitcoinization, other currencies losing value fast while bitcoin gains it). That would of course make the debt denominated in these failing currencies easier to be payed off, but that's not really paying off the debt, as in terms of real price, the creditors won't be receiving what was really owed to them. It would just be a disguised way of defaulting the debt, as when governments monetize it.
@_date: 2014-06-27 15:57:47
No tax "makes sense", but yeah, there's open debate about that. (consumption vs property taxes). I've seen good arguments for a small consumption tax as the least destructive alternative, since consumption is generic (won't create price distortions if applied to every product/service equally, property taxes OTOH can only affect very specific kinds of properties) and consumption is also the last link in the chain of economic growth, so less harmful if attacked (contrary to income taxes which attack savings, for ex.) 
The counter-arguments are that consumption taxes, particularly on services, (1) are easier to evade, what would probably justify (2) more bureaucracy to fight such evasion and (3) invasion of individuals' privacy. For ex., in the state of SP, Brazil, in order to fight consumption tax evasion, the government forces merchants to give customers the option of adding their fiscal number to every purchase they made. This number is electronically transmitted to the government, which then returns 30% of the tax payed to the customer. That creates a strong incentive for people to add their fiscal numbers, merchants can't really propose a split on the gain of not paying the tax because they never know who they're dealing with, and the government gets to learn how most of its subjects spend their money in perfect detail.

Of course it's not an easy thing to do, but it's something you should consider if you live under a repressive state. It takes months, maybe years of planning, but it's possible. Better yet: it's possible to prepare yourself (like for ex. owning real state abroad instead of where you live, same for bank accounts, having a second passport etc), so that you can make it happen quickly if you ever feel it's necessary. And it's not only "because of one vaguely threatening phonecall", of course.

I think you're mixing different use cases. The buyer/seller/third-party use case is normally important when the transaction itself is not instant, for example when something must be delivered. In such context, why do you bother with instant confirmation or not? It's true what you said, the seller knows the money won't be reversed. What I'm trying to say it's that in such context, that's a non-problem.
Instant confirmation is an interesting feature when you want instant transactions. As for example when you pay in a grocery store. You don't want to wait for a confirmation in that context.

Every time you buy or sell you're affecting supply and demand, and thus the price. It doesn't matter where you do it. Of course, in a way it's analogous to gravity: if you fall from a building, you'll pull the Earth with the same force that the Earth pulls you. The planet won't move an atom, while you'll move quite fast. Same thing in markets. If you buy $10 worth of Bitcoin, you're exerting a tiny demand that will go unnoticed. If you buy millions, it doesn't matter where, you'll affect the price in a more significant way.
There are "context differences" that may create different prices for the same thing (for example a m² of land, or a BigMac, don't cost the same everywhere). But when we talk about a global commodity like Bitcoin, which can move so easily, then price differences tend to be very small. Supply and demand for a commodity like Bitcoin are pretty much global.

Perhaps to you particularly, Bitcoin-the-payment-protocol is not very useful. But Bitcoin-the-commodity is something with good potential to any investor. Risky, but with potential.
First, think about all the use cases where Bitcoin might be disruptive and particularly useful. Falkivinge four drivers might be a good read, starting [here]( 
Then, remember Bitcoin supply [grows asymptotically]( (=&gt; capped): 
While *any fiat* currency out there grows exponentially (=&gt; limitless). Actually, even physical commodities like precious metals have their supply growing in pretty much an exponential way. Take the [USD monetary base]( 
Or the [EUR M1](  (change the dates on the chart to have a good view over decades)
Or even [gold supply]( 
I hope that gives you a hint on why some bitcoin might be good for your savings, even if you don't intend to use it as a means of payment right away. 
And, I hope, in the future you will be allowed to have part of your salary payed to you in Bitcoin, making it even more convenient as a means of payment, considering the discounts that most merchants will be offering thanks to savings on CC fees.

Thank you very much Bruce for this post. People asking for regulation are either ignorant or malicious, there's no third option.
This part of your post can't be emphasized enough:
**Compliance costs total millions of dollars annually even for relatively small firms. This is why we see very few brokerage and almost no banking start-ups.**
* **This is why we see very few brokerage and almost no banking start-ups.** *
Austrian economics literature teaches this. It's not just in banking (although banking/finance is probably the most regulated economic sector out there... perhaps only health services could match it), it applies to every sector. Regulation exists to create barriers of entry to new market participants. That's obviously interesting to established market players, that will have their profits ensured and no need to adapt. Their consumers pay the price.

Bitcoin distributed ledger is organized in "blocks" (that's why it's called blockchain). In average one new block is added every 10 min, but that's not a precise number. These blocks contain transactions, and that chart is displaying the number of transactions per block.
And yes, if the number of transactions per block is rising significantly, you can safely infer that the number of daily transactions is rising as well, since the number of blocks per day shouldn't change dramatically. Of course you could just look up a chart of daily transactions if that's what you want to know.

I don't think that's an appropriate explanation. Not that a &gt;50% isn't dangerous, but it is not true that the attacker "controls the currency". That's a misconception. There are rules that no miner can break, and even the kind of attacks a &gt;50% attacker could perform have their limitations, and could eventually be countered if some consensus is quickly reached (I bet it would if a serious &gt;50% attack like freezing the network ever takes place).

It's possible for quite some time, unfortunately. Take Japan for example. Their government has had lots of deficit spending, for a long time, while its central bank was quite responsible (for a central bank) and refused to use the printing press recklessly. Today they're the most indebted government (PIB-wise) in the world, but they're still standing. This has been going for two decades if I'm not mistaken, and they still haven't defaulted, nor gone hyperinflation. I guess one day they might default, but if it takes one generation to happen, I can see the strategy selling well in democracies...
So, although it would be a great thing to take away the possibility of inflating the money supply, this alone would not prevent deficit spending. It would make it harder, but not impossible.

Not all online wallets are equal. Some keep full control of your money, like Coinbase and exchanges. Others give you full control of your keys, like blockchain.info. Others distribute this control through multi-signature. IMHO, multisig wallets are the best option, since the company can't steal from you, but it can theoretically limit the damage a hacker could do if he gains control of your machine, by setting withdraw limits for example.
Another thing I'd be worried is extortion. It'd be better if you know the buyer is legit and not somebody that might send criminals to get your coins after the deal. Protecting your privacy, i.e., not giving the buyer enough details to find you after the deal, might be a good idea.

Thank you for your reply, and congratulations for your initiative.
I'd like to use the opportunity to leave you a suggestion: try to make S/MIME integration the most seamlessly possible for the average user. Web mails like GMail will probably never adapt since they need to be able to read your data for their business model to work, but most corporate mail users read their mail using things like Thunderbird or Outlook, and AFAIK these local clients integrate well with S/MIME certificates. Perhaps if you could help them getting their certificated generated locally via a simple webapp and signed by your authority, and then a little help for them to import it on their local clients, even these people would be able to use end-to-end encryption and signature. That would be a significant progress I'd say. It would also facilitate the integration (e2e encryption) between different privacy-conscious webmail providers like yours.

No, what I was thinking was not the number of nodes, but the number of coins. If your 100 nodes only hold 1% of all coins, they only account for 1% of the "voting".
I was thinking about demanding that at least a certain amount of coins holders sign for a block, raising the bar for a takeover significantly. But I can only imagine the scalability issue this would represent. How large would the signature need to be? And by deliberately fragmenting coins all over you'd make it even huger. Unless there's a way to make it constant size, which I doubt, this is not feasible either. What, I guess, rules out PoS as an option. :(

That's what logic and normal notion of jurisdiction would imply, but don't count on it. The US government is notorious for completely ignoring the basic idea of jurisdiction, and going after people abroad which happen to have US customers, even if exclusively via the web.

So, if your UK-incorporated business doesn't respect US rules but also doesn't care about who uses it, then you might end up with an extradition request on your head.

Have these index funds performed nearly as well as Bitcoin in the latest years? 
I know the principle that the past is not guarantee of future gains, but the point is: today Bitcoin has an enormous potential, and many people invest in it for this reason. And when the day comes that Bitcoin can no longer gain value as fast as it's been doing recently because it has already reached a large and stable user-base, it would still be better to hold it instead of currencies which inflate and depreciate. A "stable Bitcoin" would probably still return more than a general savings account, and you don't have to lend them to anyone to have such return.

Confirmations would likely be irrelevant in a deal of such an amount. A property transfer on these amounts would certainly be done through a contract, and the terms of this contract would likely deem the transfer void if the payment is reversed.
You can safely accept checks for payments of this size, and checks are easier to "revert" than Bitcoin transactions.

My personal opinion on why the price fell recently:
A recent DDoS attack on the network caused some withdraw issues in some exchanges. The attack exploited something called "transaction malleability". These exchanges were forced to temporarily block Bitcoins withdraws until they could fix their software and protect themselves against the ongoing attack.
People who had coins in those exchanges started getting worried they wouldn't see their money again, and in an attempt of retrieving it they would sell their coins against fiat and withdraw fiat money (which obviously doesn't suffer from a DDoS attack on the Bitcoin network). This selling pressure made the price go down.
There's obviously a lot of panic too. Many people sell at any glimpse of bad news. And these recent news understandably scared lots of people.
The technical issue is partially solved: Bitstamp has already restored their withdraws according to some links I've seen here on reddit. Other exchanges will probably do the same within few days.

I see sidechains much more as a solution to experimentation than a scalability thing. If we start using sidechains for scalability, what will happen is that all miners will connect to all chains being used (why not?). What's the point? Just increase the capacity of the main chain and spare people from wasting time and money doing the inter-chains transfers.
There's no reason to segment the Bitcoin network. It can easily take much more transactions than what's handling now, by many orders of magnitude:

I mostly agree with you, the &gt;50% attack is frequently overrated. I've seen people believing a miner with &gt;50% would "own the currency" or something like that.
That said, it could be dangerous nonetheless, particularly if coming from a political entity with access to large amounts of stolen money to burn. If the Bitcoin network stays a couple of days frozen you'll certainly see negative news all over and a good deal of credibility damage - even though the banking system freezes every weekend and nobody cares.

Although I'd like it to be true, claiming Bitcoin could end taxation is just false. Even if Bitcoin could make it much harder for income taxes to be collected (I wouldn't be that sure), *that's not the only kind of tax*. Taxes like VAT or property taxes can be levied, with little margin to evasion, without having to destroy people's financial privacy like income taxes do. In other words, even if the state doesn't know how much money you own nor how do you use it, it can still tax you. That's precisely how they used to do a little more than a century ago, when income taxes didn't exist anywhere.

The EU censorship on Google called my attention more than the Bitcoin news... I wonder if the only reason why these big internet companies have to submit themselves to all sort of jurisdictions is because they must have a legal presence in the jurisdiction in order to receive money easily from people there. If hypothetically Google could use Bitcoin to receive money from their advertisers, couldn't they place themselves outside of the EU and give them the finger? (of course, assuming they could remove everything else from there, like the devs they have in London etc).

Yes, some countries have such free borders (Schengen area) and are not in the euro zone nor in the EU, for example Iceland, Norway and, for the moment, Switzerland (their referendum about imposing quotas to immigration will probably get them kicked off of the agreements though). Many others are in the EU but not in the euro (Sweden, Czech Republic, Poland etc)
Now, about Italy going back to the Lira, I doubt that would be a good thing for Italians. The euro, albeit still a fiat currency managed by a central bank, has been fairly decently managed when compared to the equivalent alternatives, thanks to the Germans' strictness in monetary policy (the German mark was one of the best fiat currencies prior to the euro). I highly doubt an Italian central bank would do better. They'd probably just print lots of money to pay government debt, financing it through the worst form of taxation that is inflation.

I fully agree with the idea of people being responsible for their decisions, and I'm totally against things like bailing out banks, or saving companies that should go bankrupt, just to protect their clients/employees with money stolen from taxvictims, for example. The idea of bail-in, that's being so criticized by many, is one of the best (less worse?) ways I see to handle a bank failure.
All that said, the part of your post that I quote above is victim blaming. It's definitely not the clients' fault. Nobody deposited money on MtGox with the expectation of not seeing that money again. Don't mix things up.

On this cooperation vs competition false antagonism: 


No, it is in human nature, and it's not inherently evil (nor good). *Actions* can be good or evil. Greed can motivate both kinds of actions. I'd say it normally motivates more good actions than bad ones.


It's a very good thing that you realize that. Most people don't see such an obvious fact and accord government more power than they would accord to any other "large conglomeration of people".


I don't. I would be more than happy if secession rights would be recognized. Not only of administrative regions like states or municipalities, but mainly, individual secession rights. You secede from your country taking all your property with you. Be you a natural or legal person. The day a government (which already recognizes property rights of course) recognizes such basic right, then it is no longer a government and start being a voluntary, sovereign organization.
So, if the people that don't agree with me want to keep living under their current governments, so be it. Just allow those who don't to secede.
FWIW, no state in the world recognizes such right to my knowledge. The prince of Liechtenstein wanted to put such right in the little principality's constitution, but was blocked by the parliament. At least municipalities of the principality are allowed to secede if they so vote for, but individuals are not.

And I thought this "jurisdiction invasion" was mostly a US thing.
So now what? If Coinbase for ex. (or blockchain.info, seeing how vague the law seems to be) keeps serving Canadians without following their arbitrary laws, the Canadian government will request the owners extradition? Arrest them if they ever step into Canada? Or do they have a China style firewall in place to block the web site? (The French gov does exactly that against foreign gambling sites that do not comply)
If things keep going this way, Bitcoin entrepreneurs won't have much choice besides going anonymous. Otherwise they'll end up practically forbidden to travel internationally, having to lock themselves in a tiny friendly jurisdiction like Isle of Mann or Jersey. But anonymous business will only work well if they don't depend (much) on trust, what's difficult to eliminate in certain situations.

What does this mean? If your transaction hasn't propagated at all (0% kinda suggests that), it has no chances of ever being included. It seems only blockchain.info knows about it, since it was created through it.
If I'm not mistaken, the default bitcoind behavior is to block dust even from propagation, and never to include it in a block. You'd have to push your transaction directly to a less strict miner (perhaps Eligius) to get it included.
Blockchain.info should consider changing their wallet behavior in order to burn dust as fees for transactions like this one.
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:10:38
If it's not for profit, i.e., if it's just to mess things up, then freezing the network would be much more serious. And against such kind of attack (either messing everything up or completely freezing the network) there are theoretical solutions, like embedding the notion of transaction priority into the criteria for block acceptance in order to reject blocks that don't have a minimum of actual transactions in it (this idea was once outlined by Gavin in his blog IIRC). 
It's important to realize that no pool has any interest in this, as that would be an attack on their source of revenue too. So I wouldn't see GHash.io doing it voluntarily. There's always the risk of somebody else using their infrastructure for a while though, via hacking or via coercion (the state). If it's a hacker, GHash.io could ultimately shut everything down and the attack would cease. If it's a state, then yeah, things get more difficult. That doesn't look likely though.

If it's proof-of-stake, as said above, it's orthogonal. Multisig is built with scripts on the transactions that can exist under any blockchain algorithm.
If you're talking about point-of-sale, well, then normally the coins leave the wallet of the customer and go to the wallet of the merchant, or the merchant's payment processor, since, well... that's why points-of-sale are there for. Any or both of the wallets being multisig doesn't change anything.

Address replacing malware is particularly dangerous, since not even using a hardware wallet is enough to protect you against the theft. This example in particular is a bit dumb, as just replacing the contents of a copy/paste is something that the user can see. But a more evolved one that actually replaces the contents of a web page for example, would be much more dangerous.
The only protection I see against this is the use of the payment protocol, plus the discipline of never transferring too much money at once to non-authenticated addresses. We can't expect non-technical folks to have such discipline though (even geeks will probably lack it quite frequently), so wallet software should display big scaring warnings to non-authenticated addresses.

Unless of course the attacker is working with dishonest miners, but that's definitely not "almost too easy".

Safety will probably be solved soon. Modern ultralight planes are fairly safe, they can take off and land at 60km/h only, and even have a parachute for the whole plane. If Google's self-driving car technology is adapted to such planes (what should even be easier I think, since by setting different altitudes you avoid most of the problems, there are no pedestrians/cyclists on the sky etc), that should render them quite safe.

This just highlights how absurd these regulations are.
Providers foreign to the NY jurisdiction could perhaps block NY IPs, but they can't block VPN and Tor because that might be blocking potential customers in different jurisdiction. The intention of the regulators here seem clear: they want to force every webwallet to demand identifying papers to every customer. That would obviously be absurd, webwallets wouldn't even be able to financially sustain identify verification, and that would make them lose customers. That's NY trying to impose its rules world wide. What if in one jurisdiction anonymous webwallets are accepted, and therefore a provider there refuses to collect identifying data on people because he considers that the right thing to do (and legal where he lives!). How can NY criminalize that? And how can people claim this is a correct respect of what "jurisdiction" means? This is totally invasive.

This is an arbitrary, hard-coded limit (1Mb per block max). It was introduced by Satoshi because at the time it was simpler than providing means for miners to come up with consensus.

@_date: 2014-08-08 08:43:06
Yes, but that's because Bitcoin usage is growing exponentially as the user-base grows (exponentially).
Once the user-base stabilizes, the blockchain storage growth will become more linear. And the bandwidth requirements would stabilize (become rather constant). Resources, OTOH, will probably keep growing exponentially as they've always been.

The transfer seems to take some time to happen, what suggests me that it was sent through the p2p network. That's a pity, because the sender's phone could have sent the transaction directly to the receiver's phone via Bluetooth or something, and it would show immediately at the other side. Then of course both publish it on the network if they're online. But the nice thing is that even if they're offline, at least an unconfirmed transaction would be there sitting on the receiver's phone waiting to be sent when possible.

Suppose you earn your living in Bitcoin. 
Use localbitcoins to get cash, Coinapult Locks to reduce your exposure to bitcoin's volatility (if you're not brave enough), and a bitcoin debt card to pay for merchants that do not yet take bitcoin directly when you're out of cash.
With this setup, you don't really need a bank account. Except for investments in financial products, but that's just while OpenTransactions and/or ColoredCoins aren't yet ready for it. ;)
So, perhaps the demand is not really a big deal today, but if we want to make it easier for people to earn their livings in bitcoins (great for those who work for international employers), then I think bitcoin debt cards are a necessary step.

This. People don't realize, but in many contexts, corruption is what allows people to breath. If the law was to always be applied literally, it would be much more destructive than bribes. Actually, if officials have the means to extort you some bribe so that you can avoid a greater threat, that's likely because they've been granted powers they shouldn't have in the first place.

ASIC-heating would be the equivalent, in terms of heat/W, of a simple electrical resistance. Heat pumps are much more efficient as they exchange temperature with the outside air or even with the deep ground. You get multiples kWh of heat per kWh of electricity spent. If people want to decrease their heating bill, that's where they should be looking (or perhaps replacing electricity as the source of energy)
Plus, mining farms can also direct their heat to some large organization that needs it. I know an example of a datacenter that partnered up with public pool. The heat of the machines is used to warm up the pool.

I don't think so. You can't always rule out subjectivity. 
But regardless, we already have an actual solution to most political problems: the recognition of secession rights, in other words, individual sovereignty. Liechtenstein was about to get that into their constitution. I mean, the prince wanted to, but the Parliament blocked him. Now at least the municipalities of the principality can secede, but not the individuals. Had the individual secession right being recognized, Liechtenstein's government would be the first to stop being a criminal group. It would not fix its past crimes, but it would at least stop being criminal from that point on.

I'm sorry for those who lost money to this scam, but for us here this ends up being a good example. We may use it every time somebody brings MtGox up, and add that with cryptocurrencies, it would at least be *possible* for the fund to prove that it has control of the money and show that the trades are happening (thing that MtGox did not do). They would not be able to claim a successful trading strategy this way without actually having one.
Once proofs of reserves become common place in the Bitcoin world, with automated independent bots verifying claims for ex., this kind of scam would be much harder to play.

That would not change much in what concerns the price. Of course, it would be great to all those benefited by it, but if coins are sold instants after they're bought, the price stays pretty much the same.
Okay, that could bring some larger visibility to Bitcoin, more people would hear about it, and with that eventually more investors would join, but ultimately what supports the price of Bitcoin is people's interest in holding it. You don't need to hold any bitcoins to use it in a remittance service.

Peter Todd is extremely worried about Bitcoin scalability. I don't share such worry, but regardless, AFAIU, TreeChains could distribute the charge of validating the blockchain.

I must admit I don't really know how it works, I haven't taken the time to study it in depth, so I might be saying some BS here.

The actual threat of a &gt;50% attack doesn't come from the profit-oriented ones. It's pretty clear that such an attack costs more than it generates as revenue. The threat would be an entity using somebody else's money, without any concern about earning it back. A political entity trying to shut down the network.
That said, I'm inclined to say the best solution is proof-of-stake, not trying to better decentralize mining. No matter how much you decentralize Bitcoin mining, the total hashpower will be limited by how much revenues the network can generate to miners. Some people might mine on a loss, but we shouldn't count that as very significant. So all an attacker has to do is amass more hashpower than that. Now, on a proof-of-stake chain, the attacker would have to buy more than half of all coins. That's practically impossible, as the more he buys the more expensive they get. No matter how rich your attacker is, he won't manage to acquire more than 50% of the monetary mass of an important coin.

I'm not sure they are correct there. If I remember well all those discussions about dust, bitcoind will simply reject your transaction. Meaning you'll only be able to get it propagated if blockchain.info manages to send it to nodes that do not implement the default behavior concerning dust, what's unlikely. And then it would need to reach a miner that also doesn't follow this behavior.
Try pushing the transaction directly to Eligius, perhaps it might deal with it (I'm not sure). But if this transaction gets included, you'll end up with dust in your wallet (the change address). Depending on how blockchain.info picks the inputs for its transactions, it might eventually picking the dust again. I don't remember what's the default behavior concerning dust *inputs*, but they might just be the same as for the outputs.
Or else follow other people's advice and rebuild the transaction, this time with no dust in its output. The good thing for you is that, as the previous one has not propagated, nobody will treat the second one as a double-spend attempt.

When you go abroad and use your USD card to make a purchase in foreign currency, you only get to see the price in the foreign currency, and quite frequently you'll be ripped off on the exchange rate.

I applaud their attempt, but I have some questions.
First question: is their client open source? That's important. Even for open source there's the risk of backdoors. If the source is closed, it's even worse.
Second: how can they make end-to-end encryption if I send an e-mail to somebody who uses GMail, and has no S/MIME certificate nor PGP-key?
Anyways, I don't want to be negative. Even if the communication is only private when done between clients of their service, that's already an improvement over traditional mail servers that reserve the right to read your data. 
I wonder how do they intend to make money though, if they can't parse your mail to put personalized ads in it.

In another similar topic I gave [this answer]( which I'll just copy here:
Perhaps to you particularly, Bitcoin-the-payment-protocol is not very useful. But Bitcoin-the-commodity is something with good potential to any investor. Risky, but with potential.
First, think about all the use cases where Bitcoin might be disruptive and particularly useful. Falkivinge four drivers might be a good read, starting [here]( 
Then, remember Bitcoin supply [grows asymptotically]( (=&gt; capped): 
While *any fiat* currency out there grows exponentially (=&gt; limitless). Actually, even physical commodities like precious metals have their supply growing in pretty much an exponential way. Take the [USD monetary base]( 
Or the [EUR M1](  (change the dates on the chart to have a good view over decades)
Or even [gold supply]( 
I hope that gives you a hint on why some bitcoin might be good for your savings, even if you don't intend to use it as a means of payment right away. 
And, I hope, in the future you will be allowed to have part of your salary payed to you in Bitcoin, making it even more convenient as a means of payment, considering the discounts that most merchants will be offering thanks to savings on CC fees.

That might be because of the priority formula, not due to the backlog size per se.
The default implementation (bitcoind) has its priority calculation, and many (most?) miners follow this default policy. Transactions whose priority is below a certain arbitrary threshold and which contain no fee will not be included by these miners, even if there's enough available space in the block. The priority increases with age though, so it's just a matter of time (may take days) for these transactions' to have enough priority to be included.

Yeah I know. For now, we only have seller's reputation to avoid that (what can be good enough quite frequently). But I suppose that if such kind of commerce develops more, and the manufacturers in India as you say realize it, they might start adding things like authenticity holograms or whatever to their products. If I understand correctly, these manufacturers are not breaking any local laws, so they shouldn't have much problems doing it. They just need enough demand to justify adding the costs.

Then perhaps comparing to e-mail isn't such a bad thing. The same way you need an e-mail provider to use it, you need a wallet to use Bitcoin.
For people that are non-technical, I suppose the easiest is to direct them to a multi-sig wallet. Or, if you prefer, a "shared-control" wallet (just say they're cool because the provider can't move your money without your authorization, no matter how hard he wants it or how many guns are pointed to his head). Eventually offline wallets like Trezor if they are willing to put more money in.

True. But if the other miners are using bitcoind standard rules, wouldn't they dump them upon reception? 
And if they're writing their own rules, why give room for spammers? 
@_date: 2014-12-20 12:47:03


This is the preferred solution and it's perfectly doable in my opinion. Miners could have "tolerance levels". For example, refuse to mine on top of blocks which exceed a certain size, unless the said block is already N blocks deep. Miners could publish their current configurations in order to work-out a consensus. An actual  "decentralized", spontaneous order solution to the problem.
But honestly, I'd be happy enough with some formula that follows demand, like setting the maximum size to 1.2  times the average size of latest blocks every time the difficulty is recalculated, for example. That holds spammers (even spamming miners) and allow for growth. It's still a top-down, "centralized solution", not the best, but at least it's better than what we have now.

Sigh... there's nothing "backing" anything here. The term "money backed by X" was used in the past to indicated that some particular bill was a contractual substitute to X. Bitcoin, dollars or euros are not a contractual substitute for anything. Neither technology nor trust nor anything. There's no contract. Nobody is offering you an amount of "trust" in exchange for an amount of bitcoins, dollars or euros. That's what "backed by" means: somebody is contractually obliged to pay you something in exchange for the money substitute.
The price of these currencies is driven by supply and demand, as the price of anything else.

But there's the thing. This absurd discrepancy cannot continue. If this asset is supposed to track the price of BTC, some arbitrage must be allowed to happen. And as soon as arbitrage is possible, the prices should finally converge.

There's no need to be a direct link between the wallets of those who consume the meat and the wallet of the meat provider.
Actually, that's pretty much what happens today, only that all the money stays in an intermediary account. Different customers pay the market, money is stored in a bank account, and then eventually used to pay different suppliers. Just remove the account where the money sits for a while and you get what was described above. It's sort of "just in time" for money.

But the wealthy would be equally taxed, it is only postponed. And while it's postponed, an excess of production (savings) is let available to everybody else for a cheaper price (the more savings, the lower the *actual* interest rates will be - and these are truly low interest rates, not interest rates artificially brought down by money printing as we have today)
All that said, for a minimal government I'm still not sure which is less worse between property or consumption taxes. A minimal government shouldn't be much more than a large condominium, so taxing people on the value of their real estate seems to make sense to me.

I'm not sure but I think the default behavior (bitcoind) is to block dust outright, isn't it? If that's really the case, that transaction will never be included in a block minted by someone with bitcoind.

But then you transfer to the buyer the question of whether such third-party is trustworthy. For all you know, the third-party could be the seller itself.

I don't believe GST is payable on the supply of traditional currency.
Having to pay GST on the sell of coins results in double-taxation for merchants who accept bitcoin as payment and convert them to fiat. The only way out would be to "export" those coins, since everything exported is exempt from GST. If payment processors manage to make it easy for merchants in Australia to handle all the accounting hassle, and if recovering fiat from abroad is also easy and cost-effective, then yeah, perhaps this ruling won't be much to worry about.

Specially if they're filling it with random transactions of theirs. They wouldn't be able to broadcast these transactions prior what means that even if the constant time block announcement feature gets implemented, they'd still be wasting time broadcasting it.
The reason I believe they wouldn't be able to broadcast the spam transactions before is that they'd soon run out of old outputs, meaning their transactions would be too low priority to be broadcasted. They'd need to pay fees for it. If they choose to pay fees, then the attack starts costing money for the attacker and being lucrative for its victims.

It doesn't need to be stored entirely in RAM.

I agree with this feeling, with some some remarks though. It would be simpler to switch from one provider to another, providers would not be so strongly bound to each jurisdiction of this world (they could easily change their jurisdiction), and mathematics could allow for full transparency.
That said, yeah, they could be manipulated and regulated by states just like banks.
But don't worry. I'll repeat what was written in a Bitcoin Magazine article months ago: in 20 years, we'll be able to run full nodes in mobile devices. That's because hardware always progress exponentially, while Bitcoin resource consumption is only growing exponentially now because Bitcoin usage is also growing exponentially. Once usage stabilizes, so will bandwidth consumption, and storage will grow linearly.

If your account was emptied because the hacker manage to install a keylogger or equivalent on your machine and get your password, then choosing a wallet that gives you full control does you no good either. It might just happen again.
Either you go offline mode (**never** access your coins from the same system/machine you use to browse the web), or you share the control of your coins via multisig with some wallet that allows you to set withdraw limits. In this second case, even if the hacker manages to steal your password and log into the wallet, he'll only be able to steal the amount you set as limit, and you'll probably be able to intervene before more damage is done.

These people arguing for a fee market are being almost dishonest, specially when they claim that that's what a f**r**ee market supporter should stand for.
I'm as much for f**r**ee market as it can gets. Free markets are the best way to allocate scarce resources. All scarce resources, even law and justice services. We need free markets because, well, almost everything in this world is scarce, and we must deal with it.
But **artificially** creating scarcity for everyone, just because you want to see a fee market going on? WTF? That's like artificially creating a problem, and then claiming: "Hey, you always support this solution to these problems. Why aren't you supporting it now?" Derp!

The attacker generating the spam transactions must choose:
 * Don't broadcast spam transactions. That means that his block will take longer to be announced, even after constant time announcement is implemented. He increases his chances of losing it in a race. 
 * Broadcast the spam transactions with no fees. This way he'll soon run out of old coins, the priority of his transactions will go down and he won't be able to broadcast them anymore. Back to first point.
 * Broadcast with fees. Well, this way he'd be spending money and giving it to the ones he intend to attack. :)

I realize this was a silly attempt of sarcasm but let me give a quick reply anyways: I don't know much about these two sciences you mention, so I can't tell if they can or cannot be studied through an empirical method (I'd guess neuroscience can, since it's more biological, but psychology should probably have another branch under praxeology if they want to reach correct conclusions.. but again, I don't know much).

When you're not a national of the jurisdiction you are, the chances of being extradited are even higher. So in a way they can severely limit your international travel options.

No, they still can't do whatever they want. Of course they'd have significant influence under this scenario, but they still can't inflate the currency above its predetermined limit, and that means they can't devaluate it at will. They can't inflate it for decades long, or hyperinflate it. 
Acquiring more through taxation is different to creating more through inflation. When you inflate, the supply increases thus the price decreases. If they tax it and store it, the supply decreases meaning the price will increase. If they want to decrease the price, they would have to get rid of their coins and never acquire more, but that could only be done for so long.

I don't know if I can really ELI5, but you're certainly not 5 so I hope you understand. ;-)
A hard-fork would be the creation of a new Bitcoin protocol, which is incompatible with the currently existent one. The chain (all transactions) would be the same up until the fork. From that moment on, there could be two separate chains: one which keeps following the old rules, and a new one with newer rules (for ex. no blocksize crippling limit).
If practically everybody agrees to the new rules and start using the new software, the old protocol would peacefully die. It would just be a software update, everything would be just fine. This has happened ~~a couple times~~ in Bitcoin history already. If I'm not mistaken ~~two~~ one bug~~s~~ required a hard-fork to be fixed. ~~The overflow one and~~ that Berkeley DB blown up thing. Since ~~in both cases~~ it was pretty clear to everyone that the Old Bitcoin was bugged, everybody migrated to the new one without hesitation. 
OTOH, If there's a hard-fork and a significant amount of people refuse the change and keep using the old version of the software, then things can get complicated. 
First, everyone who had coins prior to the fork will now have the same amount of coins on both systems, "Old Bitcoin" and "New Bitcoin". If both systems keep living, it's hard to predict how the price will behave. People who believe in the New Bitcoin would try to change their coins in the Old Bitcoin against coins in the New Bitcoin, and vice-versa. Eventually the price difference will tell which Bitcoin has more support. Talk about volatility. Miners would obviously adapt to the price and mine where there's more money to be made. So people here saying miners are the one to decide are not really correct. It's usage that will decide where mining power will be employed.
Oh, and transacting with coins prior to the fork on this scenario could be quite complicated. Think about it. You had money in address A which existed prior to the fork. You want to spend that on the New Bitcoin chain to pay some merchant who's accepting New Bitcoin. But address A also has money on the Old Bitcoin chain, and any transaction you send on the new chain could as well be duplicated on the old one (assuming the tx is compatible to both chains, which could easily be the case). If you want to pay one guy with your new bitcoins, and this guy is a thief, he may just publish the transaction on the Old Bitcoin network and get those coins of yours too.
So, it would be in the interest of everyone who had coins prior to the fork to send them to *different* addresses they control on each side of the fork, in order to be sure you now own two different wallets, with Old and New Bitcoins. Once you've done it, you exchange them and adapt your portfolio to any percentage of New vs Old Bitcoins you would like to hold. Imagine the chaos that would be to non tech-savvy users, they would be more lost than a goose on a snowstorm. That would be a PR nightmare and I'm afraid it would hurt both Bitcoins after all.
Edit: The overflow bug could be fixed with a soft-fork.
@_date: 2015-01-21 18:07:04
I agree with Gavin. There's no reason to intentionally cripple Bitcoin. It can do much more, why not let it? 
Actually, I don't think we need a blocksize hard limit at all, configurable soft limits would work just fine and are much more free-market, decentralized, spontaneous order etc. But unfortunately that won't get support so if at least Gavin's proposition passes I'm happy.
Miners incentive is something that will not be a problem for decades, up until there many solutions will be found. Like bank/webwallets/exchanges indirectly paying miners to include their transactions so that users don't need to bother adding fees. Or even companies doing it simply because they want to see the service turning. Think about how many things Google provides us for "free", simply because they want the data to exist and be known to them? Similar things will probably happen to transaction fees. Users will probably need not worry about them in the future.

From that point on, bandwidth usage will be constant and storage usage will grow linear, if you're archiving the whole thing, or also stabilize in a fairly constant way, if you're storing only UTxO and pruning the rest.

Subsidizing any industry is *always* a bad idea. There's no way that taking money from everybody to give it to a group could be a good thing. If whatever that group is doing is demanded by society, it will get its funding. If it's not getting funded, it's because as is it's not demanded, and should either cease existing or adapt/evolve. Saying otherwise is believing  in central planning, believing a small group of people knows more than the entire humanity.

Even in traditional multisig, by gaining control of the user's computer you also can steal its password, authenticate with the multisig provider and steal money.
The protection comes from the fact that the provider may have withdraw limits configured for the user, and changing such limits may require days in advance for example. So the thief will only be able to steal up to your limit, unless he kidnap you for days or something.

It's not all about anonymity, although that's an important part of it (an important tool to achieve what we really need). But the thing is about not being vulnerable to the US government, to bail-ins and bail-outs and all other forms of censorship and confiscation.
These are very indebted governments we're talking about. Eventually they might get desperate. When I was a kid I've seen what a desperate government can do. The Brazilian government in the early 90's simply confiscated the savings of millions of people. My grandpa lost most of his life savings on this shit. Would you really trust the US government to never do the same?
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:00:52
Oh sure, your kids will still be US citizens even if you have them on another jus solis jurisdiction. There are many jurisdictions that recognize jus solis and multiple citizenship. 
That said, if your kids are born abroad, they'll have no US indicia on their foreign passports. That alone may make it easier for them to open bank accounts abroad. Plus, if you don't ever register them on the US consulate, I'm not even sure they'll be treated as US citizens for all purposes. They would have no papers saying so...
Singapore might be complicated not only because of conscription, but also because they don't recognize multiple citizenship if I'm not mistaken. But there are other jus solis options. Panamá, Costa Rica, Chile, even Brazil (the country is full of problems, but the Brazilian passport is a decent travel document nonetheless).

The axiom I cited is not ambiguous. If your code of ethics *unambiguously* ends up exterminating mankind when applied, then, well, it cannot be applied. The text I linked above for example makes it clear how "universal communism" (everything belongs to everyone) would result in this outcome, and therefore is not a valid ethic code. 
Also, do not confuse ethical principles or rules with the individual application of each case. The original appropriation is a *principle*, and as such is quite clear. To know whether each instance where somebody declares to have originally appropriated something is true or false is of course something that will require investigation of the case and eventually some subjectivity. But the rule/principle is not subjective. It's as saying that "you shall not kill" is a subjective rule because we can never know for sure if each murder really took place.
And just for the sake of the argument: your exaggerated what-if example becomes quickly irrelevant because if you abandon your property, it can be appropriated by somebody else. Nobody cares about keeping ownership of the air they exhale, AFAIK. And if they cared, they'd have to define it clearly, what would be so ridiculous that simply wouldn't make any sense.

Wow so it's explicit, on the law? If you don't want to pay us taxes forever, don't ever put your feet on our domains back again? That's explicitly authoritarian. I thought only dictatorships would be so explicit on their totalitarianism.
Well, one obvious consequence is that now people will no longer renounce. If you don't renounce and evade taxes, you might get arrested if you ever enter the country, meaning in practice you can't enter the country. But if you renounce in order not to pay taxes, you won't be able to enter the country anyway. Just don't renounce then and evade whatever you can, the consequences are the same with the chance of being able to come back if this citizenship-taxation model is ever reviewed.

It certainly might solve the problems for those who run away. And if enough people keep doing so, the organization losing its people might eventually change to stop the bleeding. It's analogous to stop shopping at a store you don't like.

Wouldn't it be possible for the bounty requested to be pegged to another currency, even though what's being donated is Bitcoin?
I understand there are some technical challenges but I believe it's possible. The lighthouse protocol would have to recognize a "price publishing" protocol, with some form of strong authentication like SSL. And then you indicate that for example your bounty is done when you reach X$ according to the dollar price defined by publisher P.

Then just don't make it "massive". As I replied on another comment, there are many governments out there which don't tax income at all. The Cayman and BVI governments for example survive by adding fees to imports, as used to be the case of the US federal government in the past.
And honestly, I don't think Bitcoin alone can kill income taxes. Perhaps wealth taxes and investment income taxes (capital gains), since it would be easier to hide your wealth and investments away. But labor income could still be taxed as most employers will just keep reporting their numbers to the state. 
VAT as well is still perfectly possible, and at least in EU it accounts for a good percentage of governments revenue. I read somewhere that half of the French and Swede government's revenues come from VAT. Not sure if it's true but anyway, it's probably a big chunk.

If imports get considerably cheaper, that will indirectly drive the price of everything else inside on the long run. Commodities will be cheaper to buy, Swiss industries will have an easier time acquiring them, what will allow them to decrease their prices / increase their product's quality / invest somewhere else etc. (and btw, prices may simply increase less fast than abroad instead of decreasing, it's the relative that matter here)
It should be simple actually. The exchange rate is the first thing to change due to forex liquidity. But the CHF raising in price means it's getting more valuable, so it will obviously increase in purchasing power eventually (if such increase is not purely speculative and ends up holding)


Mercantilist detected.
If these Swiss companies hold CHF, they also became wealthier. They can now buy cheaper/better raw materials, cheaper/better means of production, cheaper/better labor abroad etc. They are wealthier, what allows them to use this extra wealth to either become more competitive or pivot their business to something where their competitive advantage is more significant.
I'll repeat myself: The idea of decreasing the wealth of all holders of a particular currency in order to temporarily subsidize a much smaller group of society (exporters) is not only evil in nature but wrong from a simple utilitarian perspective.

Cut unemployment insurance and lets just see how many will find a job in a few weeks. ;)
Once I heard about a survey done in France. There they have 2 years unemployment insurance. The majority of people would either get out of it quickly, like on the first month, or only like in the last month of it. Very few people would get off the insurance somewhere in between. So basically, you have those who care about their careers and thus try not to be unemployed, and those who only work to make money. These unfortunately are a big bunch and they won't care about looking for work if you pay them not to.


Please stop. That's offensive towards people who actually live in the direst poverty. Living in poverty means you don't have an actual ceiling over your head, you barely have anything to wear and you frequently starve. Your neighborhood is riddled with serious crime. Your infant child might not survive if there's a drought. That's living in direst poverty. That doesn't exist in the EU.


Greece's government is an acting entity, not the country. It's important to distinguish countries from governments. Countries don't act, governments do.

On the definition of inflation: 
Additionally, on a "natural" economy, that is, one where money is apolitical, limited commodity (like gold and silver used to be), the "natural" thing, specially after the Industrial Revolution, is for the production of goods and services to grow faster than the supply of money. In a "natural" industrial economy, most prices tend to decrease with time, not increase. If our prices increase today, it's because the money we use is issued at will by governments, who increase money supply faster than economic growth.

Production quotas are incompatible with free-markets. What you're proposing is to arbitrarily limit the supply, based on formulas or arbitrary numbers. That's not free-market.

I entirely agree with your post, except the use of "which is why" on this sentence I quote. To me, it's not because it's evil that other governments don't do it, it's simply because they cannot afford to.
After FATCA and all the treaties the US has signed to get this beast running, it wouldn't surprise me if other governments try to plug themselves onto this same infrastructure so they can do the same. The US would probably help them. France's government for example has hinted on that direction more than once. Let's hope other EU countries block them. But they already practice that towards Monaco and nobody says anything. Finland and Italy already do citizenship-based taxation for a temporary period if I'm not mistaken.

The idea of decreasing the wealth of all holders of a particular currency in order to *temporarily* subsidize a *much smaller group* of society (exporters) is not only evil in nature but wrong from a simple utilitarian perspective.

Even if exporters are 70% of the population (they're not anywhere closer to that), it still doesn't make sense to take wealth out of everyone to temporarily subsidize these 70%. Not to mention what I've already wrote in other comments around, if these exporters also hold CHF, they also get wealthier, what allows them to profit as well.

Although you're right about the things that matter, you're ignoring the fact that inflation hinders prosperity, and thus decreases how well the other indicators could be doing.
There are two main nasty effects of inflation:
* It's not neutral. When more money is created, it is not distributed evenly among all holders of the money. Those who get it first (mainly government and bankers, and those with good contacts among these first two) get to spend it before the economy adjust the prices. Wage earners tend to be the last to receive the new money and thus they lose purchasing power before they can increase their nominal revenue. This is a disguised form of tax that increases inequality. This point is valid for all forms of inflation.
* In modern economies, new money is created to manipulate interest rates. This is even more destructive than "simple inflation", as it pushes down the nominal price of credit, which in normal conditions should reflect the supply and demand of savings. This "fake cheap credit" will make economic agents perform many investments that will not be possible to complete, since there's not enough real savings to finish them. Initially there'll be boom, followed by a burst. Economic cycles which destroy capital that is wasted in many *malinvestments* that will go bankrupt. Here, if you prefer a prefer a "rap explanation", listen to uncle Hayek:

As I said, first you should ensure you control two different wallets, one for each system, with different addresses. Addresses from before the fork should be emptied to address after the fork you control. And that might not be as simple as it seems since any asshole could make your life difficult by republishing the transactions you send in one network to the other, just for the pleasure of screwing people.
Then, if/when you manage to separate your coins like that, you just exchange them as if they were different cryptos. As if your were exchanging bitcoins for litecoins and vice-versa.

That governments cause inflation is an undeniable fact. They monopolize the money supply. By definition, only them can create inflation.... if anybody else tries*, they'll be thrown in jail, accused of money counterfeit.

They have no requirement, but you can bet their competitors will look closely to any opportunity. Remember that in such society that would be no stupid "moral damage" laws.
EDIT: Actually, I just thought about it again for a second. They don't have any "requirement", but neither has the state. Many states don't expose anything, and you can't complain. But apparently some states have had to expose something in order to calm down their subjects. If subjects can make states expose part of their inner workings, why wouldn't consumers have even a greater power? Such businesses could voluntarily accept to be audited, if only to keep a good image.


This argument is normally made by those who haven't looked into Austrian economics yet. Please look up on the subject of cartel formation, and how inefficient cartels can't stand for long. This is valid for all economic sectors, from justice to telecoms and natural resources. There are multiple historic examples. Inefficient cartels can only be kept by state coercion and regulation.
EDIT: And by the way, the current justice system is the worst possible kind of "cartel": a coercive monopoly, that none can challenge. Any cartel in a free-market can be challenged by a new participant. And if the cartel tries to employ violent means to ensure its dominance, that would be seen as a crime and fought as such in that society. In our current society though, such violence usage is accepted as legitimate, if it comes from the state.


This is basically a "package". The reputation of the arbitrage will leak to the "drafter" (retailer). If the drafter is peaking biased arbitrators, it's as if in the end there was no arbitrator. Imagine if Amazon was always screwing its customers through bad arbitrators. Do you think they would keep the market share they have? (don't forget: their competitors can attack them through advertising and such)
Now, when the stakes involved in the contract are more important than an ordinary purchase at a retailer, and you really know nothing about the reputation of the other party in the contract, you'll certainly try to make sure the arbitrator being chosen is trustworthy. You'll probably involve a lawyer you trust in the contract drafting, to make sure your interests are protected.
EDIT: As you've seen in the others editions I made above, you should try to apply the critics of your previous post to the current monopolized system. You should easily see how worse it is. ;) A free-market is not perfect, since humans are not perfect, but it's certainly superior to a monopoly.

This. Even if it requires a small datacenter to run a node, that's still perfectly ok. It's easier to be a datacenter than to be a bank like institution like Coinbase. Plus it can be done in all 200 world jurisdictions. That's decentralized enough. 
And let's not forget that it will not require datacenters to run full nodes. Hardware advances exponentially. Bitcoin resource usage only grows exponentially while adoption grows exponentially. But adoption has a ceiling. So when adoption stops growing, bandwidth usage will stabilize and storage will only grow linearly. In 20 years time will probably be able to run full nodes on mobile devices.

It's so simple and obvious to increase the limit. Incomparably simpler than this whole segwit thing. If they intended to do it, it would have been done by now.

You really think this a "neutral" feature?
Yes, the patch per se might be harmless. But I don't see it coming alone. For me, only someone against the usage of SPV would write this.
If Gregory believes there are better ways to do lightweight nodes, then please  do it. But why the intention to fuck up with the currently functioning SPV nodes? This seems to be again a battle of egos between the Blockstream folks and Gavin+Mike, not a push for a neutral feature.

As OP said, it might be interesting for miners to do it in order to create more scarcity in Bitcoin transaction space, raising the price that has to be paid for it. Since miners "own" that space, by deciding who gets to use it, they might see it as a good thing.
Of course, that might backfire. People are free to fork off or migrate to an altcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-29 11:21:14
You're right in theory. But just see how freaking difficult it is to organize a hard fork for something of obvious need like the block size increase. Trying to make one for something of a more dubious need like that would simply not happen.
I think people would just migrate to an alt instead.

I thought BIP 100 required soft forks every time a new limit was to be chosen. And these require lots of politics and would probably only happen after significant congestion, outcries etc.
I also don't appreciate how it gives full decision power to miners only. Miners kinda have an incentive in keeping the chain "tight" as that bumps up transaction fees.
Edit: Found this doc: 
Is that the last version of the BIP? 90% of hashpower for 3 months is way too much. Such an agreement for such a long period would only be achieved after *severe* congestion of the network.

Nobody is protesting anti-spam or anti-trolling moderation. Do you even know what happened?
@_date: 2015-08-04 17:22:17
But... how does that solve it?
I mean, the publisher would then need to have access to all these keys, in order to sign the update differently for each device. So, either all keys are generated out of the same seed, or you would have a (very) dynamic set of keys to backup safely. And if the backup/seed gets compromised, all keys get compromised.
Okay, before hitting send I thought on how does this help: the criminal would have to push different signatures for his malware, one for each device. But, again, the publisher must also have a mechanism for that, or perhaps the device goes to pull its signed binaries somewhere, I don't know. Assuming the hacker was good enough to steal the set of keys, wouldn't he be good enough to hack this delivery system as well? Basically doing what the publisher would do when sending an update?
I understand these are all difficult things to accomplish, but anyways, I'd just like to know what would be the plan if that were to happen.

2FA is good to protect your account from hacking. But that does not protect Localbitcoins itself. They're a hosted wallet, meaning they have full control over your coins. That's not safe. If they get compromised, every wallet there can be stolen. 
The safest option is to either control the coins yourself if you can, or share the control with some site through multisig. Lookup for multisig wallets that open source at least their client side code.

@_date: 2015-08-04 16:46:04


This is part of a larger problem: address are random characters and you cannot know whether they belong to whom you want to send the money to. This is a problem to all hardware wallets currently. AFAIK none of them have yet implemented the payment protocol (it's not that simple), the only theoretical solution to the problem (addresses would be signed, pretty much like TLS certificates)

These hubs would need to be licensed entities. That by definition requires trust. You'd need to trust them with your personal data, financial privacy etc. They would need to operate just like banks in what concerns censorship of transactions as well.
@_date: 2015-08-12 10:53:11
It's also important to emphasize one thing: these payment nodes would likely need to be licensed entities in most jurisdictions they operate. Even if they decide to operate in a friendly jurisdiction that doesn't require licensing, doesn't censor payments and respects privacy (is there any such jurisdiction?), they'd still be easy targets to the big bullies of the world. "Easy" points of failure, let's say.

You can "protect" your SPV nodes by simply adding a checkpoint to the first block post-fork. And actually you can do that even before the fork because, you know, Gavin and Mark are not the kind of person that would write a client that lies about its own nature: BitcoinXT actually announces itself as such. Don't like them, don't connect to them.
Your suggestions of sabotaging XT by making a client that lies about its intention to adopt larger blocks sheds a good light on your character.

Why do you prefer QR over NFC?
One obvious advantage of QR is that it can be printed on paper. But for transactions where both sides will have an electronic device like smartphone or tablet, what's the advantage of QR?
@_date: 2015-08-27 08:04:15
That's not so simple.
Okay, you could limit upload by limiting the number of peers you would propagate a transaction to. But you can't really decrease download as you need to have all transactions, otherwise you're not a full node.
There have been some proposals years ago about some "partial-nodes" schemes, in which each node would only download a random part of a block and validate it, and then these nodes would have a communication system between them to alert about invalid blocks. This way, provided there's enough partial nodes, the entire block would be validated collectively by them, and all of them would know if a block is invalid. I don't know what happened to these propositions, I haven't heard of them for a while. Perhaps some theoretical flaws were found or people simply judged it too complicated to implement.
@_date: 2015-07-13 16:42:48


The borrower is stealing the bank's money. He's at fault.


In this case you simply inverted the creditor/debtor signs from the sentence of above. If the bank borrows my money, it has an obligation to pay it back. If the bank lends it to a socialist government who then defaults, and as a consequence the bank doesn't pay me back, both the government and the bank are at fault. The gov owes the bank, the bank owes me.
(Isn't all this obvious?)
EDIT: Perhaps I shouldn't have used a government in the example above. Replace it by a company, individual or whatever. Governments by definition will always commit crimes to pay their debts (they will resort to taxation and/or inflation). By lending to a government, you're in full knowledge lending to an entity which you know will take other people's money to pay you back. You know the interests you earn are payed through theft. The moral implications there are a bit more complicated.
@_date: 2015-08-25 22:02:47
Then use the version that only includes BIP101.
@_date: 2015-08-28 07:53:49
It shouldn't be, but everybody is willingly giving them too much power, IMHO.
For ex., BIP101 shouldn't wait for mining power to come along. Just convince the main stakeholders, and once they're on board, just fork with any amount of mining power you've got. Make a checkpoint on the first &gt;1Mb block, and if necessary, even a hardcoded initial reduction on the difficulty (with 12,5% of hashpower, 8Mb would already give the same throughput though, so that might not be necessary). If enough coin holders go along, the value of BIP101 coins would be high enough to attract the miners.
But no... we're allowing them to decide, and, oh!, what a surprise, they prefer the option that gives them all the decision power!
But anyways. Even if miners end up with all the keys to set max block size in the future, that might not be that awful. After all, they're the ones who really need to hold the chain and validate it. And they're the ones making more money with more transaction fees. So they have the incentives not to go either too small or too big.
@_date: 2015-08-18 10:31:41


* Current implementations of SPV nodes don't care about blocksize. They only care about which chain is longer. It is therefore **impossible** to fork Bitcoin, taking a majority of hashpower with you, without taking current implementations of SPVs with it as well, as they simply follow the majority. The ability to fork is *a must* on every open source project, there's nothing ethically wrong with what Gavin and Mike are proposing, quite on the contrary, you're on the wrong side, morally-wise, with this noXT sabotage thing. If you don't want SPV nodes to follow the majority of hashpower in the advent of a fork, then it's up to you to come with a solution to that.
* As I said before, it is very easy to update SPV wallets so that they prefer to ignore XT even in the case it forks out with a majority of hashpwer. And it's easy precisely because the developers of XT are not writing a software that lies about its intentions.


You seem to be happy somebody did it and willing to push it, though, regardless of the destructive consequences this might have. You prefer to destroy everything if you can't "win". That's childish.


Of course, me too I'd prefer people would all want Bitcoin to be able to grow, but some people want it to remain small no matter what, and these two visions for the project are irreconcilable. It's time to accept that. Collaboration will no longer be possible between these two groups. Let us secede in peace. Why do you want "war"?


Over everyone's advice?? Lots of people have been asking for this since years. I myself have been asking for something on the direction of this change since 2010! (and I'm not fully satisfied with these BIPs as they still keep the limit as a hardcoded value, it should adapt to demand) Thousands of people also expect this to happen, as you can see by this turmoil. How can you possibly say "over everyone else"? God complex much?
@_date: 2015-08-11 22:25:07
Let's not forget that the owners of the hash power themselves can always move to a pool that "votes" for what they want. We should remind miners about this. Taking a conscious side on this is important, one should not simply let others decide for them.

Same here. Even when I was still kinda of a socialist and was first introduced to Libertarianism... the moment I saw the claim that taxes are theft, I tried to refute it, but quickly realized that would be in vain. It's obvious that taxation is theft. The only way for it not to be is to claim the government legitimately owns the entire land it controls, what should be an obvious absurd. So yeah, for a couple of years I went with the "ok it's theft but we need it" argument, until I ran out of excuses.

Ok but that doesn't change what I said. For every good or service there is a theoretical price point which maximizes revenues for the supplier.

It is not broken. But it could be broken by a large enough quantum computer, as theymos said.
I presume when these first large enough QC start showing up, they'll still need some time to break an ECDSA key. Hopefully more than the time a transaction takes to be confirmed. And before these computers get fast enough to break the key that fast, Bitcoin should have incorporated a QC-resistant algorithm to be used instead of ECDSA.

Blockchain.info and GreenAddress depend on a server, it's not P2P. Don't know Ninki.
Electrum until last I heard was totally dependent on a server as well, it was not SPV. And even if the client is now SPV, verifying the headers and  such, without bloom filters, how do you get your transaction set without exposing your addresses to the server? With bloom filters you can get a high false positive rate. And since they're P2P nodes, they don't need to ask the same set to every node they connect to, they can distribute it.
I don't know how DarkWallet operates either, but again, without bloom filters the most I can imagine is an SPV that exposes his address set to a server. Since DarkWallet was supposed to be private, I'd appreciate to know how they handle that without bloom filters.

If somebody gives you a gift, they're not entitled to any retribution on your part. And BTW, remember that you don't own the value of your property, the same way you don't own your "image", these are only opinions other people have of you/your property, and you don't own other people's opinions.


Are you a partial owner of the street? Perhaps you should have payed for the lighting. Or not, depending on how things are manage on this particular condominium. That's not relevant.


Your birth (and your health as a child) is pretty much a gift from your parents. Use it as you please. (Pubic order?)


WTF? What any of this has to do with anything? Are you talking about debt inheritance? You must not be forced to accept any inheritance, and by extension you must not be forced to inherit debt. But it's only fair that creditors have priority over the wealth/assets of a deceased person. Only after creditors are fully payed, the remaining, if any, go to heirs.


So what? I don't understand your point. Children might or might not inherent property from their parents, including quotas of shared properties like the infrastructure of the condominium where the deceased parent happened to have a house/apartment for example.


How does it work if your condominium needs to renegotiate the elevator maintenance contract? I've seen condominiums who actually do it by informing everyone and making a vote, and I've seen those who simply accord some decision powers to some people. Both solutions are fine as long as contractual and voluntary.

Generic computers like laptops or smartphones are dangerous because the software that runs on them must be able to change very easily. This makes equally easy for attackers to install malware on your device.
Dedicated devices like these hardware wallets have very specific software, that can only be changed by the manufacturer (if even possible to change it - and some might require physical action on your part to change the software). In practice, you cannot install viruses on it, even if you wanted to.

I'd like to know that too. Also, can multisig wallets even possibly comply with the license, or are they necessarily incompatible? Because if the license states that the wallet operator must be able to freeze or seize the funds of its customers, then by definition that's incompatible with the multisig principle.

When I mentioned barriers to entry I meant the artificial ones, laws and regulations. A simple way of doing it is removing all mandatory regulations and replace them by a voluntary system of certification for example. The FDA would no longer have the power to prohibit you from selling any drug, but they could voucher merchants that only sell drugs they approve, and if you trust them, you buy from these merchants only. They should also stop receiving funds from the state and it should become possible to anyone to compete with the FDA, providing different guidelines and certifications. Ultimately, merchants would be free not to search for any certification if they didn't want to. You should be free to risk your life.
Patent laws are wrong by definition, as intellectual property is incoherent with private property. There can be contracts, like NDAs and such, and if you break the contract you're liable. But if I never engaged in a contract with you, you cannot forbid me to manufacture something.
That said, in my previous comment I was talking about governments that simply relax patent laws by making them last less and opening up more to generics. That lowers down the price of medicine.

If you already own bitcoins or any other cryptocurrency, converting between them is simple. Of course there might be conversion fees but they're affordable.

If by security you mean the mining aspect, then every solution available to altcoins would be available to the sidechains as well: merged mining, PoW with SHA or different algorithms etc. The main difference there is that there would not be the inflationary reward.
I'm not sure it could "destroy" all altcons, but it could harm many of them yes. You can basically recreate every altcoin as a sidechain, but their unit of account would be Bitcoin itself, not another currency. So you can have all the cool features some altcoins have, with the network effect (in what concerns the price at least) Bitcoin has.
@_date: 2015-07-25 13:50:35

You have to pay *your* debts. The one you assume yourself. You're right to make a distinction when talking about governments. They assume debts on the name of others, and that's obviously criminal. That's what I tried to express with the Edit of my previous post.
So yeah, governments don't have the right to force others to pay the debt they assume, and since they cannot produce anything, the only ethical solution is default. If you've loaned your money to a gang which you knew was going to force others to pay the debt, well, it's hard to have compassion towards you, sorry.

Ethics is objective and defined through logical reasoning. Intellectual property conflicts with it, there are numerous incoherences.


Although many authors do provide many answers to this question, the question itself should be considered irrelevant. It's equivalent to the questions of "But who will pick up the cotton?" or "How could agriculture possibly work?" that were directed to people supporting the abolition of slavery in the 19th century. One needed not to predict that big machines making thousands of small explosions inside them would provide the energy needed to work the land. That was irrelevant. The point was that slavery was wrong, as is intellectual property.
If some sections of the economy *really* can't exist without intellectual property (or without slavery, or without legalized theft (=taxes) etc), then these things should not exist at all.

Yep, the [main problem is cultural](


I'm not so sure. As another commenter said, do that and all other countries indebted to the bones will want the same treatment. Perhaps that would be the best solution, a major default by all governments, *if* that would to be followed by no more debt (like, legally forbidding states from contracting any debt at all), but I don't think that would happen. And the short term effects of such a major default would be huge, even if in the long term that's the best solution. Anyways, it's easy to understand why the EU doesn't want to simply forgive the debt: in order not to set a precedent to other states.
But perhaps simply accepting that they will not pay and kicking them off the EU (or just the eurozone) as "punishment" would be enough to dissuade other governments. Or not. Hard to tell.
One thing is certain though: to keep giving the Greek government money is the stupidest option. And that's the path they've chosen.

What's being called SPV-mining does make sense, provided the miner validates the contents of the block after receiving it entirely. And if verified it's invalid, stop immediately and ignore that header. Why aren't they doing like this? 
BTW, how do SPV miners know which transactions to include? Even if they were to ignore all transactions received before the header, it's still possible for the miner of this header to have included transactions in it that he did not forward, and then conviniently chose to forward them to the SPV miner after the block header.

They're "able" to refuse anything right now. They can implement their personal blacklist if they so wish. 
I believe what you're asking is whether that would happen automatically. And the answer is depends : initially all coins would exist in both sides and thus would be expendable on both sides. With time, coins minted at one side would be exclusive to that side. And if a pre fork coins gets mixed with a post fork coin, then it will only be valid on the specific chain.
@_date: 2015-08-17 21:58:46
What he says is technically true: currently, SPV nodes would not be able to distinguish between XT and Core. When the fork happens, they'd trust the longest chain, which would necessarily be XT since XT itself won't fork unless it has at least 75% of hashpower on its side. 
That said, there are easy ways to make SPVs aware of which chain they should follow as [I said in my comment](

Pardon my ignorance as don't really know how BTCJam works, but do they quote the debt contracts in BTC? As in, the debtor has to pay back the same amount of BTC given (not its fiat equivalent) plus interest?
If that's the case, it's crazy, even if they manage somehow to solve all these frauds. Bitcoin prices can swing too fast. For more than a year the price has been either flat or going down, what makes it easier for debtors to pay back. But what if we see a huge spike like that of 2013? People would be defaulting en masse, many simply because they wouldn't be able to pay even if they wanted.

It doesn't sound logical to higher up prices in one place to cover for losses in another place. 
By "higher up" I mean charging a price above the point at which total revenues start falling due to decreasing sales. Every provider wants to price his goods/services at exactly the point in which he would maximize revenues. Putting it above or below this theoretical point would mean less profits.
If a different market is bringing you losses, it's better to abandon that market than incur in less sales in the "good market". OTOH, if the high prices in US is not reducing their sales there, that simply mean they *can* afford to charge that price there. It means that that price level is not (significantly) above the ideal for them. And if such price level is considerably higher than other markets without interventionism, then the reason can only be interventionism blocking competition from bringing the prices down in the US.

Here, an entire book about it: 
There are hard copies on amazon I believe.


There's nothing criminal with organizing fixed infrastructure. You just need to respect people's property rights, as well as contracts.
Build some network infrastructure on some land you legitimately own (like streets, power cables, plumbing, sewage etc), sell the plots to whoever wants to buy and make they agree to a contract establishing base rules for the administration of the shared property, like in a condominium, or even keep managing the network yourself, outsource to a company, whatever. That's all voluntary (contractual) and fine.


If that person is trespassing yours or somebody else's property rights, you have the right to stop him. Of course, if he's benefiting from it as a indirect consequence without disrespect anybody's right (think of the beekeeper and the flower farmer example), then yeah you have no claim.


Debt as a contract is something perfect legitimate and contracts must be respected. But for a contract to be valid, all persons whose property is involved in the contract must agree to it. That's why debt issued by states are not valid contracts: the state is selling a claim on other people's properties.

I partially agree with your conclusion.
Yes, "average people" cannot be trusted to properly secure private keys. But there are alternatives to a middle man that completely controls your money::
* **Multisig**: That's probably the best option. The middleman doesn't need to have full control over your coins like Coinbase. Use multisig and withdraw limits. That prevents the middleman running away with your money or lending it away, and also limits the damage in case you get hacked. 2-factor and other technologies also considerably reduce the risk of successful hacking. Oh, and remember the middleman can be at any jurisdiction, preferably one that won't immediately provide full visibility on your finances to the IRS/DEA/FDA/FBI/CIA/NSA/KKK/ETC.
* **Hardware wallets**: A more expensive option, but really good too, and totally bypasses the middleman. If done properly can provide equivalent (or better) security and better privacy than multisig.

Where does this committee come from?
Even if somehow it really is not part of the state (I doubt), it still is a central organization, much easier to manipulate/bend/bribe/etc.
Most likely its members would be appointed by government officials (yeah as you can figure I haven't read the thing... but these ideas are frequently just rehashing of old ideas)
EDIT: Okay just so you don't say I'm overly lazy I watched their introduction video.
I'm sorry, but it's just the same BS all over again. The video shows they lack economic knowledge, by claiming that money creation at a steady rate is necessary, and also by claiming that lack of money creation provokes recession (when it's actually the inflation-fueled-malinvestments of the boom period that will inevitably create a recession in the future).
And then the solution: let's create a "democratic committee", "accountable to the public" and with the "public interest in mind" (seriously? how naive have you got to be to fall for this crap?), and let's *finance public spending directly through money creation*. And there you have it! Money printing financing the state directly! Aren't the risks obvious yet?
Seriously my friend, for a monetary system to be fair and sound, **no one must have power to create money at will**. Precious metals were good as they imposed a natural limit on money creation. Bitcoin is much better. And this particular proposal of giving full power to the state is even worse than the crappy system we have in most developed nations right now, where at least the bankers' self interest hold inflation back.

Just a remark, you're confusing monetary inflation with price increase (or price inflation). What's predictable in Bitcoin is the former, and what central banks target is the latter.

The ECB is a state institution. And if I'm not mistaken the IMF also belong to multiple different states. 
And even in the case of the Fed (your likely source of confusion), although they're privately managed to some extent, they're still closely controlled by the state, have monopolistic powers only the state can grant, and I believe their excess profits go to the Treasury (have to check on that one).

No they are not. Giving the state full control over money creation is much worse than giving the car keys and a bottle of whiskey to a teenager.
Every country in history that has experienced hyperinflation had such system in place (fiat money where the government may spend directly the money it creates).
The system where banks have the ultimate control, although still unfair for giving too much privilege to bankers, have at least shown empirically to be much more robust. AFAIK none of these ever went hyperinflation. What's happening in the US right now, with banks holding inflation back even though the Fed is creating money as crazy, is an interesting phenomenon. It's against bankers interest to see the economy they profit from turn to ashes due to hyperinflation. And believe me, having to give money to these parasites is much less worse than going through absurd amounts of inflation.
Of course, the best would be a form of money that no particular entity can create out of thin air, indefinitely. Commodity money. Precious metals were great. Bitcoin is even better. :)

Brazil does have a treaty with the US. You might be confusing with the fact that Brazil never extradite its nationals. But for that he'd have to acquire Brazilian citizenship before.

Don't be ridiculous. Even with a 99% rate of false positives, that would still be multiple orders of magnitude less data to download than a full node has to. Specially once Bitcoin starts to be used by millions. And you know this.


None of the proposals lift the limit so high. It will still be possible for small companies or even enthusiasts to run it. Heck, even tor exit nodes are run by enthusiasts, and that demands a lot of bandwidth!
Finally, for the only purpose of validation, is theoretically possible to build "partial nodes". Nodes that would validate a random piece of the chain, and communicate with other partial nodes, sending alerts and the like, if they see something wrong on a block. No such implementation exists yet, in part because it's still very easy to run a full node so there's no actual demand for it.


Even if the current implementations of SPV wallets don't really attempt to foster privacy, that doesn't mean it's impossible.


In the next paragraph you talk about using LN and voting pools though. These are off-chain services. I don't want to rely on them, as long as possible. And it is possible, even if it means running a full node will require more commitment and resources.

That idea is already implemented in some alternatives. I believe the name is pay to future miners.
Basically, you have a free size limit, which is a function of previous block sizes, and an actual max limit, function of the free limit. Blocks up until the free limit size don't take any penalty. Blocks anywhere between the free limit and the max take a penalty in the inflationary reward, which is distributed to future miners. This way, to raise the average block size and thus the limits, one must receive in fees more than what he'd lose in this penalty. It's a way to make the max limit track demand without leaving space for a miner to game it by creating larger blocks artificially. 
Why do you think this is a bad idea?
@_date: 2015-09-27 11:42:46
Check my answer to PotatoBadger. What you propose is something similar to pay future miners. It's already implemented in some alts. But instead of paying with higher difficulty, you pay with a penalty in the inflationary reward. Perhaps in Bitcoin difficulty would be a better thing since eventually there will be no inflationary reward. But I don't know, I have the impression miners would never risk being outrun just for some more fees. They would always publish the first block that's allowed in order to ensure that revenue. But at the same time, since hashing is random, the first block they solve might already have enough work to add a bunch of extra transactions, so it might just work as well.
Edit: Ignore what I said. The block hash is obviously a function of the transactions in it so you must know you're breaking the size barrier before start your hashing. Meaning you'd have to calculate the probability costs against the extra revenue in advance. 
I'm not sure if that's better than just decreasing the inflationary reward.

In many systems (including US and EU), it's only the banks that may ultimately release the money to the market.
Central banks can increase the monetary base (M0), but that money doesn't enter the market if the banks don't create credit. If the banks simply hold excess reserves, [just like they've been doing in the US since 2009]( the money the central bank creates never goes to the market. This gives banks a sort of collective control over money creation.
@_date: 2015-09-26 13:25:15
The idea was to block spamming miners.
If I'm a miner willing to spam, I can create a 1Tb block filled with transactions of my own, moving my own money. A protocol enforced minimum fee would be innocuous, as I'm both paying and receiving the fees in this case. Okay, perhaps not fully innocuous, because I'd still need to have the minimum amount before creating the block, but you see the problem right? The spamming miner would not lose money in the process.
That said, obviously there are better ways to counter spam than simply imposing a crippling protocol constant. Miners could communicate which maximum size they accept and which maximum size they intend to produce. They could also sign blocks in order to indicate how much percentage of the hashpower accepts what. Then, by not generating anything that would be rejected by a decent chunk of the hashpower, you're on the safe side. 
Honest miners have no interest in accepting gigantic blocks.

That page is not very clear. Is the proposal something that would allow the SNB to buy debt bonds directly from the "Swiss Treasury" (don't know the name), or is it something more on the lines of forbidding fractional reserves?
Giving full power of money creation to the state suggest the first, debt-free money creation suggest the second. The first would be really bad, the second I have a hard time forming an opinion. Overall I think fractional reserves can be bad, but they're certainly not unethical as many Libertarians claim. And I'm not fully convinced FRB is always bad.
@_date: 2015-09-27 11:36:00
I agree that a way for miners to sign their blocks and communicate what they accept at max and what they're willing to produce at max is the best solution. 
You might never have seen such spamming miner because there's a mechanism in place to render them moot. If there was nothing and other miners were building on top of anything that came, a political entity might use this as a cheaper form of attack. It wouldn't care about burning money in the process.

Bloom filters with high false positives and different sets to different peers when reading, not broadcasting to everyone (and hiding behind a proxy like Tor) when writing (granted, full nodes could easily do the latter too).


Mesh wireless networks are limited by range, you can only directly connect to those physically close to you. IP doesn't have this limitation, you can theoretically connect to every node on the network.


How can you possibly imagine Bitcon having millions or billions of nodes, if the database cannot settle more than a couple transactions per second?
And BTW, I do expect the number of full nodes to increase in the medium to far future, but not because we should keep a crippling limit, but simply because resource capacity will keep growing exponentially while Bitcoin resource consumption will eventually start growing linear (for storage) or stabilize (for bandwidth). Bitcoin's exponential growth will only remain while there is exponential adoption growth, and that cannot remain indefinitely.


I do run my full node behind Tor BTW. But if demand for Bitcoin transaction space makes that impossible, so be it. My wish to run a full node does not precede people's wishes for transaction space. I would either switch to a SPV behind Tor, or tolerate the risks of clearnet. And perhaps push for something like what they want to make for Monero: full integration with I2P, a darknet system in which every node is a relay. This way, Bitcoin full nodes would be making the darknet themselves.


I understand that, and I also understand a full node is better than SPV for privacy mainly for this reason. But what was blatantly wrong in your initial post that I replied to was claiming SPV completely drops privacy. That's false. **What completely kills privacy is reliance on off-chain services**. Depending on those is no different than depending on banks.




Do you know what the word [invincible]( means? 


What's the point of running your node at home if **you cannot transact with them?**


Why deep discount? Before reaching that point, I believe I'd be already slowly migrating my coins to some other investment, at market price. 


Good point, but I stand corrected: Bitcoin would certainly die much before that point. I cannot imagine the system acquiring the usage it'd need to sustain this level of fees while remaining decentralized (i.e., no dependency on off-chain services). People would simply drop it for a better alternative. Or, at most, it would turn into a SWIFT 2.0 - and that's not what I signed up for.

Well you might be surprised.
Money creation in countries like the US only goes to the market if bankers release it. Banks have a final say. The Fed may create as much money as it wants, if banks hold it as they're doing right now in the US, this money won't ever reach the market. And bankers have lots to lose if the USD goes into hyperinflation. 
So to monetize the debt the US government would first have to change the rules so that it can directly buy bonds from the Treasury with newly created money. But the moment they make such change, they'd be announcing their wish of monetizing the debt. Everybody would run away from the USD and that would severely hit the currency price much before they can even monetize the debt. That would be awful. Seizing accounts might be simpler.

Actually it does. Demand is determined by holdings. If you decrease your holdings you're decreasing the demand.

It is truly the case, even for fiat?
Would you say 1000 CHF in a [single bill]( is worthy exactly the same that 20.000 coins of 5 CHF cents (36 kg of coins!) ? 
You may say the "face value" is the same, as it is with Bitcoin, but the easiness with which you can spend these is not the same.
Anyways, it would be good if we could dissociate the amount of inputs with the fees, but I see no technical way of doing it since the more inputs, the larger the transaction, and the size of the transaction must be a parameter to its fee for technical reasons.

You can connect your SPV wallets to them via Tor, and connect to multiple of them. You don't lose your privacy there. You lose your privacy the day you need a third party like a largely connected LN node to make your transactions, since this LN node will have to abide to money transmitting laws.
@_date: 2015-09-15 11:05:32
You draw up some ridiculous, exageratted critics on Tor, ignore that SPVs have other means to ensure privacy as well, and then come up with this:


On the clearnet, smart guy? Then not only the NSA, but anyone highly connect can watch every transaction coming out of your node and link it to your IP with a very high probability. Not to mention you'd be giving away to anyone the fact there's a node, potentially with money, behind that IP.
If your premise is that we fight an invincible adversary, then yeah, by the premise we already lost against this adversary. But that's not realistic, governments are not that all-mighty, and governments are not the only adversary you should be worried with.


I have a hard time keeping civil after reading this. You're basically trying to destroy the open source project I cherish most.
If Bitcoin's blockchain fees rise to $20 or even a quarter of that, **then Bitcoin is already over**. I, and pretty much everyone with common sense, would migrate to an alternative.


You worry about privacy but then contradict yourself.
Buying high price things like houses or vehicles is something you already cannot do privately. Due to how laws work pretty much everywhere, these purchases have to be done transparently. 
But on small purchases, the ones of everyday, *the ones that really define your character and give out information about you*, then you can still have some privacy by using cash or cryptocurrency. Governments are desperate to ban cash and I believe they'll manage eventually. And if cryptocurrency self-bans itself by becoming useless for small purchases, there you've got it, full government surveillance of every aspect of your financial life.

There are some risks in merged mining. I remember years ago, this guy created this coin with merged mining and Luke Jr just went and killed it with his mining pool. So Fidelity would have to have agreements with large pools before pulling this out, if they wanted to be on the safe side.
Another reason is that perhaps they want to use current Bitcoin infrastructure. If they create another chain, all wallets, services etc that work on Bitcoin's chain would not work on theirs. That's one of the arguments against this idea of "scaling off chain". Everything that currently works would not work in whatever off chain scalability solution you come out with - assuming there even exists a valid one.

As a consequence, it's interfaces and APIs are not compatible with Bitcoin. For ex, if you had a site already dealing with Bitcoin, adding Litecoin support should be easy since your software would already have all it takes to talk with the Litecoin deamon, handle it's graph of transactions etc. Adding Monero would be a totally new development. 
I don't think they can make Monero fully compatible with Bitcoin though. Some behaviors are inherently different. You just can't know for sure what's the UTxO being spent in a transaction for ex. There are things like the mixin, an important parameter that doesn't exist in Bitcoin. Softwares like block explorers or similars can't ignore these things. But of course they can make it much closer and thus much more compatible.

This one dollar will circulate around.
If there's a total amount of debt twice the amount of money supply, it's obvious this debt won't be payed all at once. Part of it will be payed in a moment using a percentage of the money supply, another part after and so on, until the entire debt is payed (assuming there's no default). That's exactly how it happens in a large economy, there are lots of different debt bonds with different payment dates.  You don't need to pay them all at once so you don't need a money supply bigger than the total debt.

Depends on which jurisdiction you're talking about. But I'm pretty sure most jurisdictions with capital gains taxes would consider the act of spending your coins a taxable event. And the income with which you acquired these coins must also be declared. Imagine your income is in Bitcoin (could be the case in a world where kidnappers are already after bitcoins), they'd know everything. And in some jurisdictions, the act of buying an asset which could generate capital gains in the future must also be declared.

There's not a single miner. What a miner decides is not a general network rule. That's how supply and demand works. It's impossible to predict a price. Individual actors try to maximize their gains and pressures even out.
But there's a bit of truth in your comment in the sense that some parameters are defined arbitrarily by the network (inflation rate for ex) simply because we don't know how to do better.

I just meant they are used to a currency unit of very small value, so that prices are expressed on thousands, wages on millions and so on. It would be the same if we switched to bits. In the wallets I can configure I already do. I think it would make sense for services to do it by default.

The alternative implemented by XT, of dropping at random, gives every transaction a chance of at least being broadcasted and reach the miners (which we should expect to have much larger memory pools, as it's for their monetary gain)

The limit is arbitrary. 
Technically, if precision was infinite, it would never be reached, since this is an asymptotic curve. If we just increase the precision when time comes, we can mine new coins forever and never reach 21M.

Cost and speed, mainly.
If you use localbitcoins, the speed is the same as two local transfers, which should be fast. And the cost is only the spread you'll pay. Conversion fees on traditional services tend to be quite high. (Edit: forgot that for online transfers the usage of escrow is important, what will eat 1% on each transfer. It still looks cheap compared to what you usually pay in traditional services)
Ease only depends on how willing to do something different you are. Using localbitcoins shouldn't be difficult, but some people might have to learn something new and many people seem to be put back by that alone.

It's true that for average cases it doesn't seem to make much sense. Specially if the merchant is converting to fiat just after anyways.
But, have you checked the discounts you can have in sites like purse.io for example? If you're a frequent amazon shopper, you can save decent money. There might be other situations where this quick conversion can save you some bucks, or make viable an international purchase that otherwise would not be viable.

The whole point of these integrations is not to have to convince my contacts to switch to another system, create another account etc. They don't care and can't be bothered. If you're expecting them to join this scheme you're talking about, then why not just ask them to switch to a more confidential system entirely? Sometimes that's what I do. I've even convinced my mother to use RedPhone. :)
It would be really great if I could retain my confidentiality while still talking to my friends the way they're used to, but I cannot see that happening so easily.

Wait. Did you just receive an unknown transfer after creating the address, or the transfer had really happened before you creating it?
There should never be address collisions out of pure chance. If you've got a collision, it means their random number generator is not doing its work properly. And that's bad. In this case I suggest changing to another wallet at least until this gets sorted out.

Haven't read the article nor much about Liquid either, but I really wonder, if the whole point is to make inter-exchange transfers faster, why do they need a blockchain for?
As the meme suggests, they could just trust each other (and that's what the Liquid chain seems to be since there's no PoW, if I understood correctly). They could credit payments instantly by seeing it's coming from an address they trust. Or even by the other party signing a message "hey, this transaction here is from me okay?". There you have it, instant confirmation.
The fact that blockchains solve some problems in a mind blowing way doesn't mean they're the tool to solve every problem. Many problems can be solved with much better tools.

Sort by fees is not a proper solution either, since legitimate transactions with fees/priority lower than that of the spammer would get dropped by *everyone*. And while wallets don't implement a way to replace your transaction by a higher fee one that's a problem.
The fact of not recording at least the hash of what has been dropped is indeed an attack vector, since the spammer would send the transaction again and again until all legit transactions are dropped. But AFAICT this attack has not been tried yet (and perhaps there are other protections against it), while overloading people's mempools is an ongoing attack.
@_date: 2015-10-12 22:17:18
There's not an objectively observable difference. I'd say the motivation is what differentiate them. One wants to flood the network, the other actually wants to transact.
The point is: by sorting by fee, during an attack users would have their transactions rejected, simply because they didn't pay enough. Their wallets wouldn't allow them to try again and that would generate reasonable frustration.

An upload band independent of download would allow him to release everything, even if the DoS is clogging the entire download band. He wouldn't need to download anything at this point. He could also release most of it in the miner relay network before the attacker figures out who's releasing them. Plus he could also use multiple IPs for that as well. There are many workarounds, and there's money involved : people find a way.

Debts don't expire at the same time. Big debts like real state or student loans are payed in multiple parcels over years. Thus, there's no need for the money supply to be bigger than the total amount of debt.

They both may have debts which exceed the money supply as long as they don't have to pay it all at once.
Suppose there's only X of money available. A may have a total debt of 10X as long as at each payment he only needs to pay, say, X/10. It would take him 100 payments to clear his debt, and at each payment he'd need to get his hand on 10% of the money supply.

No, it's definitely not happening in the US and EU right now. You seem not to understand what I'm talking about.
Actually, in the US, it's precisely the banks who have held inflation from happening much more dramatically. The Fed increased the monetary base dramatically, but banks are holding huge excess reserves, preventing the M1 from following the same path of the M0.


You seem to be one of those Zeitgeist types. No, there's no need to create money to pay interest. You can have a total volume of debt multiple times superior to the money supply and that's not a problem since money circulates. You don't need to create new money at all, and that doesn't prevent lending from happening. 


Of course.

You forgot to conjecture what would happen to government debts, and I think that would be a major change. Governments heavily depend on money printing to keep their debts, in two ways: one, a good part of the money created ends up paying for the debt indirectly. Second, money printing devalues money and forces people to look for "safe investments" since simply holding money results in losing purchasing power. Governments debts are considered safe because this debtor in particular can force others to pay its debt. But if just holding money in its raw form could be seen as a safe investment, that would likely decrease the appetite for government debt. The fact that most governments will likely continue their reckless deficit spending up until then will also help a lot.
So, basically, governments would go back to a situation where they'd have a much harder time contracting debt. Something comparable to governments of the 19th century or before, when the debt had to be paid in gold. That would force governments to spend much less.
Obviously, before that happens, we should expect many governments to fight back... in particular those who depend on debt too much. Analogously, I wouldn't expect central banks to see their power reduced in the way of the postal service like you describe without a strong fight. Actually, central banks are perhaps the most powerful (and toxic) institution within modern states.
Finally, just a small comment: 


Switzerland does tax income and even wealth, though. They were never a tax haven as in "place with low taxes". They used to be a good place for non-residents to hide money, but even that's gone by now.

I know the justification, but let's go:


You don't know how much they're worth, so you cannot make such affirmation. For example, they might represent an asset (colored coins). And aside that, the value of bitcoin and the cost of a transaction change all the time, it's impossible to come up with a constant that satisfy this criterion, even when talking just about the bitcoin in the output.

Not at all in the same level. AFAIK there's not a single example in history of a fiat currency going hyperinflated under this scheme where money creation has to pass through banks. Not that it can't possibly happen, but so far, it hasn't ever happened. Banks do put a hold on money creation as that is on their interest.


No, trust me, hyperinflation is incomparably worse. And, almost systematically, when governments can create money to pay their debts directly, they will hyperinflate.
Of course the best scenario would be nobody being able to create money out of thin air, be it banks or governments. But among these two, banks tend to be less irresponsible.

I think Vitalik used the word asset instead of currency purposely. In his vision, investment assets like stocks, bonds, quotas, titles and whatnot would be as liquid and easy to spend as currency.

The point is not whether they're paying interest on not. The point is whether they can or cannot create money. In this system used by many central banks, governments *cannot* create money, the ultimate decision to put the new money on the market is on the banks, who have a monetary interest not to create hiperinflation. Okay, you can argue that the hyperinflation is a sort of tragedy of the commons scenario, but anyways, from a purely empirical point of view, it seems banks are holding inflation down.

They should show much they have in total, and allow for anyone to verify whether their money is there through a Merkle Tree (a structure present in Bitcoin blocks by the way, it's what links each transaction to the block header and thus to its PoW). Not only you can verify that the amount assigned to you is there, but you know that this amount cannot be simultaneously assigned to somebody else. I don't know the exact technical details but if you look for explanations on the proof of reserves thing you'll find.

Bitcoin is a currency, not only a means of payment.

I understand the issues with democracy. All I'm saying is that freedom unfortunately doesn't sell, while democracy does. And direct democracy would sell even more easily. And compared with the current representative democracies most states have, I think direct democracy has some important advantages:
* It slows things down. Current governments regurgitate tons of laws per day. That would not be viable in a direct democracy, and that's a good thing, as that would push people to use more voluntary means to accomplish their ends, instead of coercive means.
* A direct democracy would considerably reduce the effect of [concentration of gains and distribution of costs]( since it would be much harder for those who'd benefit from the concentrated gains to convince such a larger "parliament/congress", 
* Item 1 plus the fact an elector has more decision power when the electorate is smaller might push towards decentralization of power (more things being decided on a municipal level, for ex.). Decentralizing power is to me one of the most pragmatic and efficient ways to reach more freedom.

There should be no limit. Block sizes should be determined by the market. It's impossible to try to predict what's a decent limit.


Please, read the wiki page on scalability, plus that old Bitcoin Magazine article which goes by the line "In 20 years we'll all be able to run full nodes on our mobiles". Hardware resources availability increase in exponential rate, while bitcoin resources consumption will only increase exponentially while adoption increases exponentially. Once adoption stabilizes or stop growing so fast, so will bandwidth requirements. Storage requirements will then grow linearly for archiving nodes, and almost constant for those who prune.
Another way of putting it: it will always be harder to find people willingly and able to understand Bitcoin's source code, then it will be to find people willingly and able to run full nodes. Yet, people are still satisfied with the fact that the source is open and anyone capable and willing can validate it. Why can't the same apply to the block chain?
Finally, some interesting technical developments are on the works that would allow enhanced SPV nodes to validate a small random part of the chain. Add a communication protocol to submit alerts, and SPV nodes will be able to validate the chain as well. Say, every SPV node validates one thousandth of the chain. With a few more than one thousand SPV nodes connected on this alert system, they'd be able to validate the chain collectively.


Only if there's a myriad of them running on the darknet. It might be a good test case for those [autonomous software agents]( people mentioned a while ago. ;)

The reimbursement will come out of CC fees. Everybody that uses this legacy payment protocol will pay, even those who had absolutely nothing to do with the incident.
In Bitcoin, for a start Target's customers would not be stolen if Target was attacked. Target could lose its money if it didn't protect it correctly, but it's important to note that the sensible data (private keys) wouldn't need to be stored "hot" for them to accept payments. With deterministic wallets, the keys could be in cold storage. But even if they were stolen, Target alone would eat the losses. It would still be a shame since they'd be the victim of a crime, but at least it would be the only victim who could have done something to prevent the theft that would be losing money, instead of every user of the Bitcoin protocol.

Market cap is a wrong term. What people are measuring here is the money supply. So the comparison is with the ISK money supply.
When talking about fiat currencies supply, there are different ways of measuring it. People are using the M1 aggregate, probably because you can find a compiled list of all M1s here: 
I believe it would make more sense to compare with the M0 (monetary base), since we have no fractional reserve aggregation in bitcoin (which is included in the M1). M0 is all there is for bitcoin. But I haven't found any compiled list of every country's M0.

You're wrong here.* It's a question of economic incentives. The video I linked above was a small piece of a larger talk, available [here](  I strongly suggest you watch the entire video.
tl;dw: Multiple, small jurisdictions are obliged to compete much more among each other. The smaller the jurisdictions are, the easier it is to immigrate. Governments are monopolistic providers of certain services. By making these governments geographically small, you make it much easier for the "customers" of these providers to just change the provider in case they're not satisfied.
Actually, that's something you can already see in the current world. Most micro-countries encrusted in larger ones are much better off than their larger neighbors (Hong Kong, Singapore, Monaco, Andorra, Gibraltar etc), Their governments must be better, otherwise they'll just lose their subjects.
\* EDIT: Okay, you're not *logically* wrong, it's possible that one particular small government happens to be tyrannical, as it's possible to have crappy service providers even in a fully free-market. The point is that the incentives in place go against these things, making them rare, if not nonexistent at all.

The woman in red (to the left) has the typical statist profile. She says Bitcoin is dangerous (from an investment point of view) because it's not well regulated, and in a way compares it with "2008's sub-primes". She leaves it implicit that, to her, governments should probably step in. But the nicest part was that the guy in the middle intervened to say that that's not the idea behind Bitcoin. He correctly acknowledged Bitcoin's libertarian roots, the wish of so many of its proponents to end central banks, and even mentioned Ron and Rand Paul.

I don't think verification per se is the worst. Inserting the raw data into an indexed database is probably what consumes most time. Inserting data into an index is costly. Then, yeah, the index is used for verification purposes, so you may say it's verification that takes time, but it's not just CPU.
I suspect this torrent is for the already indexed database format used by bitcoind. The Bitcoin protocol should not be used to exchange such data because that would bind it to a particular implementation.

How are "we" on that, if you don't mind me asking?
Last I heard, those who think that lifting the limit will result in "100% Of Hashing Power in a Single Server Closet" would be OK with the implementation of techniques that would allow SPV nodes to validate a small random fraction of a block. Thousands of SPV nodes together could then validate the entire block and propagate alerts among themselves if they see something wrong.

They would naturally attempt to reach a reasonable consensus. You don't want to have a set of soft-limits that nobody else has. But this consensus would be flexible, not hard-coded. The point is for supply (of resources) and demand (of transaction space) to balance through spontaneous order (free market).
I once was a proponent of a self-adjusting limit, but then I realized that's just pretense of knowledge. No formula can predict the natural limits imposed by supply, let alone the subjectiviness of the demand. No mathematical model can take subjectivity into account. So, no, this top-down approach is not adequate. The approach must be bottom-up, by letting miners specify their soft-limits.

I'm sorry for your lost, but you shouldn't "freak out" for what looks to be ~9 BTC. I've lost more than that in a stupid car accident (stupid in the sense that it could have been avoided).
That said, this only reinforces what people say all the time: store your bitcoin savings offline. Maybe 2-factor authentication would have saved you in this case, but even that is not good enough. 2F-auth can't protect you against MtGox servers getting hacked or raided, for example.

I was calm, sorry for the rude words, I was not targeting you.
If you want a short answer to your situation: it's not through inflation that your problem should be solved. Inflation only transfer wealth from the holders of the currency being inflated to those which are the first to receive the newly created money. That's just disguised theft.
So, no, inflation is never a good measure.
Now, some food for thought: *why* are prices so high in Switzerland? There might be many explanations, and I don't claim to know which is the strongest factor. It might be different resistances against price deflation, particularly from worker unions not wanting salaries to go down. It might be labor laws which forbid lower salaries for unskilled labor (minimum wages and such) as well as nominal reductions in salaries. It might be immigration laws doing the same (forbidding immigrants to come and perform labor which are "overpriced" when in comparison to international levels). It might be taxation. It might be market concentration due to artificial barriers of entry. Import duties. Strict building codes restricting the supply of real state. Or, finally, it might just be that Switzerland is too expensive of a place for a freelance developer to live, after all. Many prices do go high in places where lots of rich people live, just take Monaco as an example. It's a supply/demand thing.
Again, I don't claim to know what's the main reason, but if I had to guess, I'd probably say anti-immigration and perhaps labor laws. It's not like Switzerland is famous for being a high taxation place, and it's on the TOP-5 of the two main economic freedom indexes, so I doubt it's import duties or artificial barriers of entry.
If you live there, try to look up for laws that artificially limit the supply of things (for example, are there laws limiting the building of skyscrapers in cities? How high is the minimum wage? etc). Every time the supply is limited, you'll naturally have higher prices.

And when they say "inflation remains low", they're probably talking price inflation. Thing is: with a stable currency, you have price *deflation*. You can't just look at your CPI and say, "oh, it's below 4%, it's reasonable". You must consider the whole delta, since while one currency slowly devalues, the other slowly appreciates.
It wouldn't surprise me to see a steady 10% annual rise of BTC/USD even once Bitcoin adoption settles, specially because I don't expect USD price inflation to remain low for much longer. We'll see.

There are plans to improve the default client (used by most miners) so that it considers all fees in a unconfirmed transaction chain when deciding to include them or not. That would allow merchants to add a fee to free 0-conf transaction if they want. Additionally, merchants with a moderate level of trust on their clients could wait multiple transactions to pile up as unconfirmed and then chain them all with a single paying transaction.
Another solution would be for the payment protocol to allow the merchant to specify to the client's software a formula for the fee to be payed right from the initial transaction, "inside" the price (like all payment fees are done today). [I suggested this long ago]( before the payment protocol discussion. It would avoid unnecessary transactions in the case of merchants who want to add a fee to every free-tx they receive.

It's not. It can be seized, the server can be hacked, the operator can disappear with the money etc
A multi-sig wallet, where you keep one of the keys in a hardware wallet like Trezor, and the other is managed by a web-server, that can be useful. But you need a backup plan in case the server goes rogue and decides to lock your coins forever.
EDIT: Actually, in a multi-sig scenario, you could even keep your keys in an unsafe computer, as long as your authentication method with the server is safe enough (2-factor).

Even if the most ultra-optimistic previsions (like [those of Falkvinge]( come true, I don't think what you say there will be the case.

I mean, can we even be that sure we'll be still alive 15 years from now? Most would sell their position before becoming billionaires.

This is false. Seriously, it looks almost like propaganda by now.
Some people are convinced Bitcoin should be crippled so that any fellow with a Pentium II and a 56Kpbs dial-up connection behind Tor is able to be a block generator, so they want to force this 1Mb block size limit to remain. That's pure nonsense.
Bitcoin is extremely compact and efficient. The current network would be able to handle Paypal levels of traffic. A more efficient and robust network could handle Visa levels of traffic. People have already made the necessary calculations: 
So, relax. It's important to understand that once the growth in Bitcoin usage stabilizes, the demand for resources will stop growing exponentially as it has been. Bandwidth requirements will stabilize (stop growing), and storage needs will only grow linearly - that if you don't prune. The capacity of hardware resources, OTOH, will keep growing exponentially as it has always done. For example, optical fibers are being installed in most buildings of my town. Soon most people in developed nations will have &gt;100Mpbs. It's not unreasonable to expect mobile devices being capable of running a full node 20 years from now.
I totally agree with you that off-chain transactions are not ideal. They kinda represent what Bitcoin was supposed to overcome. So I'm among those who want to see Bitcoin usage the most decentralized possible, meaning, *in-chain* transactions for buying your coffee. That's perfectly possible.
Now, concerning the use of bank-like institutions for increased security. that can be done without sacrificing decentralization, if we use multi-signature transactions. Banks can actually add security, by, for example, forbidding you to withdraw all your money at once (what would also forbid somebody from coercing you to do so). As long as they do not have full control over your money - and they need not have it - you can be sure they won't be able to spend it (or lend it) against your will.

Okay, losing your money is never cool... but seriously, what do you expect?
If a bank fails, its owners (shareholders) should lose everything. Its creditors should lose whatever is enough to save the bank, and receive ownership (shares) in exchange. Depositors are creditors. Of course, it's better to take the cut first from those who accepted more risks, like bondholders. But if those are not enough, depositors must lose too.
There's simply no better way to deal with a bank failure.

He should not mind with "bloating the chain". The chain will evolve to support this kind of transactions.
While Bitcoin is not that largely used, he could combine it with a Bitcoin ATM. For ex., the laundromat could have at least one Bitcoin-washer, and also a Bitcoin ATM in site, with instructions on how to use it (install one of these apps etc)
I bet some people might learn about it only for curiosity - and even the non-curious would end up wanting to learn about if the Bitcoin-washer is the only one not being used at the moment. ;)
I suppose that if the ATM does not accept large transactions, he shouldn't need to worry with banking regulations. But IANAL.

Daniel, first, I wouldn't call that "backing".
When somebody says that X notes are backed by Y, I understand that I can get an amount of X, go to its issuers, and redeem it by the corresponding amount of Y. X is just a contract, payable to the bearer, on Y. In other words, X is just a substitute of Y.
So, no, these reserves of the Fed aren't backing anything, as I nobody can exchange USD against a pre-determined amount of any of them.
Finally, the whole problem with the current monetary system is not whether currency issuers have enough reserves or not. The problem is that they can increase money supply as much as they please. Governments borrows more, creates more debt bonds, the Fed prints more money and buys those bonds. The reserves are there, but the money supply keeps growing! There are no hard limits, they can keep doing it until they destroy the economy, either through a huge default or through hyperinflation.
In the past, when money was really backed by gold, and currencies were just a substitute to it, the government could not increase money supply at will (without resorting to fraud, that is). Money supply increase was limited by the capacity of mankind to extract more gold from earth. That's a pretty strong limitation, compared to the complete lack of limits of today world.

Just a bit of clarity for the gringos out there: in São Paulo, every merchant must allow their customers to attach their "fiscal number" to the official invoices of every service/product sold. By doing so, the customer can reimburse 30% of the VAT (there called ICMS) he pays.
With this measure, the state government not only makes it much harder for merchants to dodge taxes, as it also acquires a detailed database with all consumption habits of most of its subjects.
What this news shows is that Mercado Bitcoin is "following the law" and paying taxes by emitting these official invoices.

This is probably the closest thing possible to a "fair resolution" to a bank failure, in my knowledge.
Owners (shareholders) lose everything.
Creditors lose the amount necessary to make the bank solvable again, and in return receive an amount of shares/stocks proportional to the "contribution" they gave to save the bank. Creditors should be picked starting by those that accepted the largest risks (like bond buyers), all the way down to those who didn't accept risks (like depositors). In other words, depositors should be the last ones in line, and ideally should not lose anything or very little.
This is not "socialization of losses" as someone said above, it's precisely the opposite: only those concerned by the bank, those who invested/trusted in it, will pay for its failure. Socialization of losses is when the entire society pays through taxation/debt/inflation.

Thank you jron! I won't say I fully understand it, but the video was very helpful (to anyone else willing to watch, if you understand bitcoin, you can jump the first ~25 minutes).
So, let me see if I got the idea: it's possible to accumulate random numbers in such a way that:
* Prevents observers from knowing which individual numbers were accumulated.
* Allows the one who knows one particular number to prove he knows it without having to reveal the number itself. Or if you do have to reveal it, it's still impossible to know which particular addition to the accumulator had put that number there, thus creating no link between the addition and the revealing of the number.

How is this VAT supposed to be calculated? Is it only on the service of the seller, i.e. its transaction fee + spread, or is the VAT over the entire selling amount?

And let's not forget that bitcoin purchases could eventually be insured too. With the difference that, when that's the case, insurers will choose which sellers to insure. Meaning that the insurance cost will be much lower.
With current reversible payment methods, every purchase must be "insured", and insurance cost is not driven by the actual risk that buyers are trying to protect themselves from (that is, seller fraud), instead it's driven by buyer fraud - which has nothing to do with it. The incentives are totally disconnected. There's no strong incentive to reduce risks (and thus insurance costs), actually it's the other way around: crime does pay, in this scenario.

There's no need to use anything like the Bitcoin protocol for such a thing people. It's not because the Bitcoin protocol and the idea of blockchain is cool, that it's the best solution to everything. It would actually make this more complicated than it needs to be.
All you need are cryptographic ways to identify people. Since every election is held by some entity, the database can be centralized. Cryptography ensures it's transparent. Voting can be done publicly while still preserving privacy. You'd need some physical wallet for people to safely store their keys. Mike Hearn has already written about this:

And I insist: it's probably much cheaper, easier and less risky to buy congressmen today than it would be to buy millions of votes. I don't believe vote-buying would be a major problem. It doesn't scale easily, and it's pointless in small scale. Spending in propaganda would probably be more cost-efficient.

As far as I understand, elliptic curve cryptography supports some operators, like a particular kind of multiplication, that, if applied equally to both keys in a valid key pair, produce another valid key pair.
In other words, if you have P1 as public key and K1 as private key, P1\*M = P2, and K1\*M = K2, where P2 and K2 are a valid key pair (what one encrypts the other decrypts etc). 
So, if you share the same random seed on both sides of your wallet, your watching wallet only needs the master public key to be able to generate the entire sequence of public keys that match the sequence of private keys the offline wallet will produce on its side.
Please note that I'm not a cryptographer so I might be saying something wrong there, but that's how I get it at least.

I took a quick look at wikipedia, and it seems that during most of that period you cite the CAD was pegged to the USD. Some devaluations and some small periods of "free-floating", but most of the time it was pegged. So the national bank couldn't have printed as much CAD as it wanted to, it had to keep the peg.
The USD, on its turn, was pegged to gold until 1971 IIRC. So, indirectly, the CAD was also pegged to gold.
It's not the same scenario I'm talking about, of currencies not pegged to anything.

Not to mention that is not that simple to carry on such an attack without making it explicit. And if you make it explicit, it is also an explicit attack against all other countries' citizens which are using/holding this form of money - which would not be few, if the price is already so high. That would generate international stress, at the very least.
Oh, and also, let's not forget that people have already thought of some potential ways to fight back. Most of these ways would involve some level of centralization though, so they're really last measures.

The way taxes are collected does matter. Inflation is the worst of all. Income related taxes are also awful.
For example, inflation creates business cycles, and hit the poorer and more ignorant harder. It's the most unfair way for government to finance itself.
Income related taxes hit savings and thus investments, which are the fuel to economic growth and for that reason only should not be taxed. And let's not forget the outrageous, privacy-rapist apparatus that is set in place in order to enforce income related taxes. (FATCA, anyone?) Financial privacy is incompatible with all income, wealth and capital gains taxes.
If Bitcoin was massively used, inflation would be out of the table. Income taxes, particularly those on investments (which are the worst kind), would be more difficult to enforce. Perhaps some governments would give up on those and try to restrain themselves to more easily enforceable taxes, like VAT and/or land/property taxes. I know that's all very optimistic, though.

Okay, let's rephrase it: encryption is useless against malware *designed to steal your coins* (which, in order to accomplish its goal, will remain as silent as possible until you type your password in).
NOTE: Do not confuse this comment with an endorsement of never encrypting your wallet. Encryption does serve the purpose of avoiding theft through physical theft of your hardware, as well as blocking easy access from non-tech savvy "evil maids" (scumbag roommates, angry (girl|boy)friend etc).
The main problem we face today is malware though, not physical thefts or evil maids.

That makes more sense for webwallets or any other kind of wallets (e.g., multisig) where somebody else keeps your coins for you. This somebody must be sure that it is indeed yourself who's authorizing the spending, and a picture might be enough in some cases.
But if you keep your coins yourself, it wouldn't be that strong as a protection. If you keep your coins yourself, either you encrypt them, in case you want to prevent theft via physical theft of your device, or you just leave it unencrypted and never put "too much" money in it anyway so the risk is not great. If you don't encrypt it, no authentication is needed. If you do encrypt it, you must use the same piece of data as key. Photos would be different every time, same thing for fingerprints or other bio-metric authentication methods. With encryption, only the good old passphrase works.
Okay, perhaps a non-encrypted wallet could be protected by software that tries a fancy authentication like picture or bio-metric. That would give you some time in case the device is stolen, since the thief would not be able to use the software there installed to transfer the money out. And if the thief is not tech-savvy, he'd never manage to transfer it out in time. But it would be technically possible to obtain access through it.
I'm more of the opinion that wallets in devices to be used in point of sales should be as simple and quick to use as possible, meaning they don't shouldn't require any form of elaborate authentication. A high-entropy passphrase is out of the question. Theft risk should be mitigate by not having too much money in them (like your cash wallet). Something like a 4-digit PIN just to avoid immediate theft and to prevent the user from accidentally paying things he did not want is probably enough, and probably quicker than taking a picture.

It's not only verifying claims that's difficult. Knowing how much to charge people is also complicated. Insurances must charge people according to the risk they represent. For example, if your car has a GPS-tracker, your car-insurance could be cheaper. If you smoke or belong to a family with a historic of genetic diseases, your health insurance should be more expensive, and so on.
Knowing what risks contribute to what degree and how to assess the different risks a person represents is a profession on itself. Perhaps one day software will be advanced enough to cover that. Or at least make it easy for different anonymous professionals around the world to contribute with their experience and know-how. That would indeed be awesome, and would, as you say, push towards a more free society, as governments wouldn't have much power to regulate such an industry.

Going mainstream != price going up up UP!
You're right that if people use bitcoin as a medium to transport value from one country to another, but they convert quickly at both ends, that doesn't create much demand for BTC so the value won't skyrocket.
But people using bitcoin all over the world for remittances would already bring the technology to mainstream. Not only it could significantly improve the life of the families that depend on remittances (by a factor sometimes as high as 10%), but it would also improve Bitcoin's infrastructure itself, and easiness of access to it. That would also make it easier for this poor people to save the little they can in Bitcoin instead of fiat, and immunize themselves from inflation. That's particularly important in countries with irresponsible monetary policies. India, for example, is the champion in remittances reception AFAIK, and they're currently facing severe currency devaluations.

Once the user base size stabilizes, the blockchain size will keep growing linearly. And bandwidth consumption would stabilize.

When people say "wire", they normally mean SWIFT transfers.
SWIFT is an old, inefficient dinosaur. SEPA is more like a mammoth or cave man. ;-) It's definitely more evolved than SWIFT, and much cheaper.
OTOH, SWIFT is much more deployed worldwide. You can use it to send money to every country which is not under severe international sanctions. Japanese banks, for example, aren't in the SEPA zone AFAIK, but they are on SWIFT. Since MtGox cannot open a ACH-enabled account because that would be inside US jurisdiction (while it can have a SEPA-enabled account in Poland and handle the SWIFT transfers between Japan and Poland itself), the only way for people to send money from US to MtGox is through the SWIFT dinosaur. To my knowledge, there's no other network connecting US and Japanese banks.
So, summarizing, the problem is not really related to transfers inside US. The problem is that MtGox cannot be inside US, due to its severe financial regulations. The only option left is SWIFT, which sucks.

In Brazil, it's definitely not "forbidden unless explicitly authorized" (although some cops might not really understand it indeed).
I doubt that's the case in Japan (do you have any reference saying otherwise?)
Sometimes the presumption of innocence can be inverted, that's true. For example, in France, if they judge that your life standard is above your declared income/wealth, it's up to you to prove you're not evading taxes.
But I still don't believe there can be a single government in the world which *officially* treats everything as illegal unless explicitly authorized.
What I know is that governments enact tons of laws per day, effectively creating an amount of regulation that no human being can actually respect (sometimes it's even logically impossible to respect them all, as they contradict each other). This way, if you ever bother the wrong person, they'll always find some law you're breaking. That's the practical behavior of most governments actually.
But, at least officially, they have to find some law which you'd be breaking. Something not explicitly illegal is by definition legal.

Treating bitcoins as consumable goods for VAT purposes will inevitably push all (official) exchanges outside of the jurisdiction that does it. Merchants who choose to accept Bitcoin payments in this jurisdiction will be forced to "export" their coins to jurisdictions that do not behave alike, in order to get VAT exemption on the sale of the coins, otherwise it's a no-go for them (unless they can entirely survive inside the Bitcoin economy, without having to go through fiat - and even still I'm not sure, how is VAT dealt with in barter transactions?). Having to perform these "accounting tricks" in order to be able to sell your products/services is certainly not very exciting and will likely slow down Bitcoin adoption by merchants in these jurisdictions.
The Norwegian government should review this stupid decision, for the good of their country.

First of all, I'm not saying it's ethical not to respect the contract. MtGox probably screwed up things. They've been having a lot of issues recently, it wouldn't surprise me. I just think CoinLab overreacted to the point of meriting the label of "suit troll".
Now, to your analogy. Did the contract said the owner could evict the tenant as he pleases, with no indemnity to pay? If that's the case, if the contract could be ended by the owner at any moment, then the tenant has no right to complain.
But normally, if you make a contract, you also stipulate the "or else...". That's the whole point, otherwise it's nothing more than a gentlemen's agreement. The contract should normally impose some penalty on the owner in case he decides to end the contract earlier.

How much is CoinLab worth? I'd be surprised if their market cap was as high as $1M. But suppose it's $1M. How could have MtGox delay have destroyed 75 times the whole value of CoinLab? It's like demanding 50 Ferraris as damage because someone stole you a Fiat Panda.
The point I'm trying to make is that CoinLab could not have lost more than what they have. I even argue they did not lose anything: they just did not have the revenues they expected. So MtGox didn't take anything from them, they've just not given what they were supposed to as per the agreement. Normally the agreement should also have stipulated penalties in case of delays/non-compliance. CoinLab should not have the right to demand anything beyond these agreed upon penalties, as no one has "future-property rights" or anything of the kind.
The net worth of MtGox is irrelevant.

Bugs normally are only detected once they start provoking symptoms that get reported. In this particular case, some people were being stolen! That's more than enough to provoke some noise.
Some bugs do remain undetected for years, decades even.
A good backdoor in open source should always be implemented as something that could pass as an accidental bug (like rendering a RNG not that random), and  remain undetected to those who don't know where to look at. It can never be explicit, like a "if (user == NSA)" or something. Actually, even in closed source software it can't be that explicit, otherwise one employee one day will have his Snowden moment.

I haven't watched the video (youtube blocked here), so my reply might not be relevant. But I've seen this talk in Europe recently (the government should "lend to itself directly", "there's no point in paying interest rates to banks" etc). So I'm replying to that.
Well, "the government lending to itself" is the recipe to hyperinflation. If central banks are used to buy government debt directly from the government, without going through banks as they do in most developed countries, it's just a matter of time before governments start abusing the printing press. AFAIK, all hyperinflation cases happened in places where governments could use the printing press directly. Still AFAIK, no country where a central bank has to go through banks before buying government debt has yet seen hyperinflation. Just look at what's happening in the US, banks are holding enormous excess reserves. They have no interest in hyperinflation, as that would erode their wealth too. They can't let it happen. Long-term, controlled inflation does them good, by transferring wealth from every currency holder to them. Hyperinflation doesn't. It's destructive even for bankers.
Please understand that I'm not trying to say the current banking system is OK. Far from it. The whole idea of monopolized money via a central bank is flawed and economically destructive. But if such monopoly is going to be kept, better at least keep politicians hands off the printing press. We may hate "banksters" as we want, but their own self-interest ends up protecting us from hyperinflation in this system.

Okay, just saw [your comment]( saying that's on the fees only they need to pay. Less bad.
How does that work for merchants though?
When you acquire a product from a supplier, you can deduct the VAT the supplier paid. But what about bitcoins you acquired from a customer? Customers won't pay VAT on such "selling of bitcoins" to you, so will the merchant be expected to pay the full 19% on the entire selling price when he exchanges these coins for fiat? That would be a show stopper.
Actually, how does VAT play on barter situations?
@_date: 2013-08-19 13:20:29
If I understand it correctly, traders would be able to deduct the VAT from when they bought it, so in the end they'll only pay VAT on their earnings. Sucks, but it's still bearable.
The real problem is with merchants. A customer that pays with bitcoins is not going to pay VAT on this act of "bitcoin selling". The merchant will not only have to pay VAT on the product they sell, but also whenever they try to exchange their coins for EUR, as they'll have no inbound VAT to deduce. They might need to pay 19% entirely on the selling price. That's a show stopper.
It would be interesting to know how things works for merchants that buy goods from individuals (like those business that buy second-hand furniture for instance) and then resell these goods. How does VAT work for them? Can they deduct the inbound, even if the person they bought the goods from was an individual that pays no VAT?

The first questions you should answer are: 
* Do you want at least a percentage of the money that comes in to be automatically converted to a fiat currency, so that you don't take the volatility risks associated with Bitcoin?
* Do you want some software to automatically calculate the bitcoin price for you, using a price fixed in fiat?
If you answered yes to the questions above, then you might need a payment processor like Coinbase, Bitpay or BIPS. They do all those automatic things. Obviously, they charge a fee, but much less then credit cards.
OTOH, if you can afford to calculate the bitcoin price yourself, and you don't mind holding all the bitcoins received and only manually convert them when you want to (if you ever want to), then any open source mobile app might do the trick. Edit: Actually, I think there are mobile apps out there which synchronize with exchanges so that you don't even need to calculate conversion prices.
Warning: if you start holding more bitcoins than you can afford to lose, please set up an offline or paper wallet. You'll find tips on how to do it around the web. That's really important, "online coins" are vulnerable to theft. If you find it too complicated to set up your offline wallet, then consider buying a hardware wallet like Trezor.

No, hidden services are always slower. That's a misconception I've seen around many times.
When you access a public site via Tor, a single Tor circuit is built between you and the public server. Now, when you access a hidden server, both you and the server use a Tor circuit to connect to a *rendez-vous* node. So there are two Tor-circuits plus a single node between you and the hidden service server. That totals 7 hops, against only 3 from a normal Tor-circuit to a public site.

Not trying to decrease the importance of improving security on Bitcoin world, but there is a major practical difference between theft of bitcoins and fraud of credit cards.
In Bitcoin theft, the victim is precisely the one who could have secured himself and taken actions to prevent if from happening. The incentives are placed upon the correct individual. With credit card fraud, the merchant frequently has no way to improve the security of the credit card - it is the card holder that controls it. And as the costumer couldn't care less since he'll get refunded anyway, there's no correct incentive structure in place. The one who cares about avoiding fraud is mostly powerless, and the one who could improve security doesn't really care*.
No wonder why things like Trezor are already been developed, but credit cards, which are many decades older than Bitcoin, keep using a "secret number" that has to be passed along at every purchase. It's like giving your private key away at every transaction!
Bitcoin security issues can be handled, and I'm confident they will. Credit cards, OTOH, will remain insecure due to their flawed model.
\* Okay, I do realize that some costumers do try to avoid getting their card number stolen, if only to avoid inconveniences. And merchants may attempt some fraud control techniques, but these are frequently expensive, annoying (like requiring identification etc), and not always effective.

I can't understand your question.
The main point of color coins is tagging them. What the tag means is a whole other story. For example, you could issue a currency backed by gold via colored coins. People would deposit gold with you, and you'd give them one colored-satoshi per gold gram, for example. You'd keep track of these colored coins yourself. If somebody else ever transfers them back to you for redemption, you'd give him the corresponding amount of gold.
The same technique can be used to keep track of stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments.

You don't need a full client to use Bitcoin. Simple Payment Verification is enough, and with bloom filters it became very lightweight.
Only block generators (solo miners, pool operators and P2Pool miners) need the full chain.
Also, keep in mind that once bitcoin usage stabilizes, the chain size will only grow linearly, while storage resources will keep growing exponentially as they have since ever. Analogously, bandwidth requirements will also stabilize (stop growing) when bitcoin usage stabilizes.
These requirements are only growing exponentially now because usage is also growing exponentially.

Yes, the Fed buys and sell bonds to banks. But there's no contract saying that $1 dollar will buy you a precise amount of anything always. The Fed buys and sell at the market price, you have no contractual guarantee of what will that market price be.
It's not like when foreign central banks could exchange $33 against one troy-ounce of gold. That was an actual contract: 33 dollars were always exchangeable by one troy-ounce of gold. It's not that you might eventually sell your $33 for this price if that happens to be the market price. It's an actual contract, $33 were backed by 1 troy-ounce of gold.

That's easy to solve if there's direct communication between the two. 
1. The seller software decides from which output it will credit the multisig address, and tells that to the buyer software. 
2. The buyer software then generate a partial transaction extracting the agreed amount both from the buyer's output and the seller's output. The buyer obviously can only sign his input. He does it and send this partial - not yet valid - transaction to the seller. 
3. Once the seller sign with his input - and he can't change the transaction since it's already signed by the buyer -, the transaction is good to be propagated. 
4. Both get debited in the same transaction, so "at the same time".

If he had defrauded people and stolen, say... 700.000 chickens instead, wouldn't that be a crime still?

No, it's SPV. Mobiles can't handle a full client (yet ;)).
And it's not necessary to synchronize block headers before sending a transaction, if you already have the money confirmed in your wallet.

Please take a look at this topic:

Just encrypt your paper wallet with a strong passphrase then.

CHF is attached to the EUR now. And JPY is also at risk now with the new prime-minister pushing their central bank to print more.
I'm not aware of any fiat currency out there worthy of the adjective "investment".

Another question. I'm no expert, but shouldn't you be using some randomness source?
I guess something listening to background electromagnetic noise would be enough.
I have no idea though how dangerous it is to rely entirely on the random generator of a CPU. But if both GPG and keepass ask you to type furiously against your keyboard while generating keys, that might mean something, doesn't it? :)

Not entering in the merit of whether a few families control everything and etc etc (that's actually mostly irrelevant - the existence of central banks itself is the matter, regardless of who control them), but if somebody were to describe PRISM to you one month before its revelation, I bet you'd call this person a "tinfoil hat" and apply the same discourse. I myself would probably think that it was an exaggeration.
And well, we'd be wrong. And no "talented journalist" helped to uncover it. It was a disgusted insider (as usual).
I usually avoid spreading theories which don't have at least a bit of evidence to back them up, just to be sure I'm not spreading lies. But we should also avoid always treating any "conspiracy theory" as "totally ridiculous". Many have turned out true:  (they should add PRISM to that list).

Why would a wallet automatically reuse an address? The recommended behavior is to always use a new one.
Are you aware of any wallet that does this?

That sounds a bit exaggerated. Put that way, having passwords at all would be useless. If any passphrase a human can think of is so easily breakable, then what's the point of using encryption to protect your data in the first place?
The problem with brainwallets is that the blockchain is public. Hackers don't even need to steal your encrypted wallet before trying to crack it, it's already public to all. 
But even still, wouldn't the use of a hash algorithm like BCrypt with a good number of rounds (something that would take like half a minute for a decent computer to calculate a single hash) be enough to secure brainwallets backed by "decent" passphrases?
All that said, I don't really see the advantage of having a brainwallet over having an encrypted wallet with the same passphrase stored in a easily accessible cloud backup service. It's pretty much the same thing, but the latter adds the benefit that only those with access to the cloud backup system could try to crack it, not the entire world.
