Ayyyy the dip is finally happening again!
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:58:50
Everyone on this sub knew a mid-January crash was going to happen, anyway. I saw predictions months ago. It's following standard economic theory, which is kind of surprising. If it drops below $7500, then levels out at $7500, it's an indicator that it's **still** following standard economic theory. From there, we cannot be 100% certain whether it will dip again or increase again.

Hmmm, I think 10b-5 of the 1934 SEA as supplemented by the Williams Act begs to differ. What an ass.
@_date: 2017-08-31 00:02:32
I'm a newbie. Can someone explain?
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:02:27
Hey, now, it's just a gamble. No need to be upset. If you wouldn't say it to a person's face, why would you type out such a rude message as that?
@_date: 2017-08-31 00:22:08
I think it will go even higher than that. This upswing is crazy, and I'm waiting for the right moment to sell. It doesn't look like time to sell yet. I'm essentially flipping. I think if there is a Trump impeachment we will see it go higher than 10k.
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:25:15
How kind of you. You must be popular at parties.

Uncertainty and chaos in the world tends to increase the value of Bitcoin. I think it has to do with people losing faith in the USD, or people losing faith in other currencies used where they live. For example, unrest in Venezuela resulted in an increase in Bitcoin value. 
Also, for the record, I am betting on Trump being impeached. I think it's not just likely, but is certain to happen.
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:04:43
I knew Hillary was a much weaker candidate than Bernie, and I knew that "blue wall" stuff was horseshit. I thought it was a tossup between H and T, and the people ultimately chose the "populist" over the "globalist." So, I thought it was unlikely Trump would win, but in hindsight, I should've seen it coming.

I've been around and investing for ~6 mos.
I don't like to follow the drama, because I think it's pretty stupid. I will definitely give your post a read when I get a minute -- you've piqued my interest.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:00:13
At this point I'd hold. I would (and am going to) buy more when it dips or corrects.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:56:22
Does it have something to do with the old fork and all that bad blood between the two Bitcoin communities? I haven't taken a side, but I only trust good old Bitcoin anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:46:39
Yeah fuck Paul LePage...
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:22:02
Seems to be the case. Reminds me of users from particular subs calling me a shill, etc. for moderating politics and worldnews. I know how you must feel seeing all that BS.
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:53:25
I started with $50 and now it's worth a whole hell of a lot more than that. Hold onto it for a few months and you may see the same gains I've seen.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:08:59
Why do they do this, @_date: 2017-11-26 22:50:54
She bought the ATH and sold the dip.
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:17:17
Definitely diversify. No investment is a sure thing.
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:54:34
For someone who is so into unregulated markets you sure do have big problems with people taking advantage of its benefits.

I want rich grandparents. If they adopt you can you adopt me?
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:39:26
Sorry, I misunderstood what you were saying. We need to vote these idiots out of office.
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:45:10
Seems to be increasing still, as well. Let's see if it hits 5k by the end of the week! Hopefully it'll go even higher this time and people won't dump. Either way, I've been converted into a hodler.
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:02:24
Oops! Used to calling it a trough because of my science background hahaha
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:31:20
Sold out yesterday to break even in anticipation of this. Not a hodler, just a day trader. You could see this coming a mile away with the drop last week. BUY AT THE TROUGH!

Tick tock tick tock

It was a sign China was up to some BS. I made a judgement call and turned out to be right. You can never be 100% certain in crypto, but you can get lucky like I did.
@_date: 2017-09-02 13:20:03
The dip looks like what happened on 8/22, which is when I bought in. I think I will wait another day to determine whether I should sell.
@_date: 2017-09-28 01:07:21
You mean $4200?
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:57:49
What? The trick is to sell, then re-buy when it dips to its min. This is my first time buying, and I sold for a profit, and plan to buy again at the trough. Who's freaking out? Flip this shit. It's easy. 
It only makes sense to have a long term investment if you have multiple thousands of USD in Bitcoin. But I would still flip like crazy if that were the case for me.

They have the power to create banks and create laws related to the banks/money. They **can** tell you what to do. I'm sorry, but it's the truth. Read Article I of the Constitution. 
It's your job to vote anyone out of office who you disagree with.

Basically, you "lock in" a stock price. When you buy a call option at $30, you're betting that stock will go to $40. When it does, you can buy the stock for $30, then turn around and sell it for $40 even though you just paid $30 for it.
A put option is the same sort of thing, except you're betting the stock will lose value. So say you think that same stock is going down to $20. When it goes down to $20, you get to sell that stock for $30.

You can do call or put options on Bitcoin value now. I was just wishing this was a thing the other day. CALL ALL DAY BITCHES.
@_date: 2017-09-08 16:52:29
It seems like China loves to crash the market. When it doesn't crash the way they want it to, they crash it further. It wasn't dropping any lower than $4600, so they decided to engage in more buffoonery. I am ready to take advantage of this. I took a gamble, and it turned out I was right.
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:07:47
Isn't Bitcoin also a gamble? No risk = no reward. Anyway, these options were the tactic they used in the movie The Big Short. A put option is also called a short.
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:32:52
Also thanks for letting me buy the dip, kind stranger.
@_date: 2017-09-06 12:00:16
How high does it go this time? I held a bit and bought back in at the trough. Let's hope for a good result.
