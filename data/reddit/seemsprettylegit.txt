*Correction: a previous version overstated adoption because it only included responses from survey participants that had “at least heard of any crypto-asset”. For context, the previous (incorrect) figures were: Total (11%), 18–34 (20%), 35–44 (15%), 45–54 (5%), 55–64 (5%), 65+ (2%). My sincere apologies for any confusion this may have caused.*
Thanks for providing the source but this is also included in the linked survey. They corrected the figure to 9% which may be closer but I’m still a little skeptical. That much of the population owning any specific asset seems like an incredible hurdle to reach.

I can’t give you an exact number but btc won’t be measured in USD, if it’s still around USD will be understood in BTC

Sounds like a good time to accumulate more

I’m a little doubtful of your claim that 11% of Americans hold bitcoin, sources welcome if you have any.

I guarantee that btc long term growth is an unstoppable force, please folks please hold. So much to gain, the world has never seen something like this before.

Your first point I wholeheartedly agree with, as for the second I think a fundamental restructuring of how the dollar is valued would work better than killing it off. It still has valid use cases as a localized, inflationary, incentive to spend. Since the dollar left the gold standard and derived its value out of thin air most of the issues with it have become more readily apparent/worsened. I think focusing on linking it to a “btc” standard might help, maybe gold too. It would create a more complete economic system. Currently we have vastly over leveraged global debt that undercuts markets while increasing btc’s potential value. If we back the dollar with btc we can create a feedback loop where instability caused by ballooning global debt creates drops in the markets and increases the value of btc which could then feedback into usd and contribute to set debt payments. And then during rising/stable markets btc would likely hold steady/decline and re-incentivize spending and investment. Anything else leads us toward an upcoming rapid global debt collapse that will hurt very many people. If I could draw a flow chart on here I would, I hope that writing it out in text isn’t too jumbled.

Certain stocks are still promising, but the market as a whole definitely not. Payments, debt collection are good longs, major lenders and community banks are strong shorts.

Not tinfoil hat, manipulation is designed to get you to give up your btc. So long as you follow the simple rule of not giving up your btc for any reason you’ll be fine. But don’t underestimate the emotional/mental games that are going to be played imo.

No ceo.  Killing btc is like fist fighting the wind.

Do the math, es no bueno mi amigo. If this is what your thinking about find work wherever you can and if you truly believe it in put money in. You don’t have to rush, as a matter of fact investing in between pay checks is basically dollar cost averaging- which is a good strategy. Play it cool, create some cash and especially don’t screw yourself into debt since it will make your investment unsustainable.

Well I’d argue both systems provide unique advantages, and that you can indeed own shares (obviously yes there are sketchy brokers but that’s not the general rule). Good ideas need investment or they can never reach their full potential. Put yourself in an entrepreneurs shoes, your livelihood and the betterment of everyone else’s livelihood depends on a healthy market of investors. I’m not arguing that the system as is isn’t shitty, btc can serve as a strong corrective force. The thing is imploding one in favor of another is going to lead to disaster, balance is key. The dollar is designed to maximize investment with little consideration for long term economic soundness, that’s where btc steps in.

With the proper precautions, sure.
