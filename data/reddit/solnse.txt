Wouldn't this ultimately be counter-productive for them? By trading the bitcoins for dollars every day, it would reduce the value of bitcoins, and presumably at their volume, it could be a significant negative impact on bitcoin price.

It seems to me that even if the identity ability was opt-in, just that fact that it was possible would make it so that certain agencies, governments, or even markets would 'require' this option be exercised in order to conduct transactions with a certain address. It's better if it's not even possible.

And seamlessly convert bitcoins to dollars at merchants that don't accept bitcoins when using the Google wallet card. Allow merchants a choice of preferred currency to receive, potentially converting dollars to bitcoins for transactions too.

They could be self-serving and accept bitcoin as payment for Prime membership only first. Test the waters and improve membership numbers from any potential boon.  Reduces the actual cost of any downside (i.e. drop in bitcoin value)

Yeah but is this more like Marlboro selling e-cigarettes so they don't eventually become irrelevant, or is it more like putting trackers into torrents so they can watch and extrapolate data from the transactions?  Whatever cryptocurrency they create still has to survive in the wild and wouldn't necessarily be controlled by them other than being a place where people can convert that currency to rubles-like a hundred other places.  How can they 'own' a cryptocurrency?
