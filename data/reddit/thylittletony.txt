Haha I just read this part:
When bitcoin reaches just 10% acceptance by the public of the world it will equal credit cards in volume thats 8.5 trillion dollars Each bitcoin is worth 500k
Again, take volume over 10 years and each bitcoin is worth 5milion!!
Stop wasting peoples time with this nonsense
I don't mind a little pumping, dreaming or trolling but use some sensible metrics

I have thought it was just fine about 8 times now, they keep blocking you again. Please report back if you get in trouble again.

I'm not, I've used the same API for months now and even with larger safety wait times than before I get denied....

I think you should read up on "monetary base" and not use GDP to calculate the value of a currency.
Btw, if you want to pump your numbers more, use GDP per 10 years instead of GDP per year, you can just multiply your number by 10, isn't it magic!

The issue is still persisting for me.

yup, it was fine until a few hours ago for me too... got a bitstamp reply that they are working on it... :S

EDIT: Did not work
From my cookie data (bitstamp.net/market/orderbook) after clearing cookies and filling in the reCaptcha:
hdrs = {'User-Agent': 'somename', 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded', 'incap_ses_86_99025' : '*.*.*.*.*', 'visid_incap_99025' : '*.*.*.*.*'}
request = urllib2.Request(self.base + path, post_data, headers=hdrs)
response = urllib2.urlopen(request, post_data, timeout=4)
Works for me, but might be coincidence, I'll let you know if this holds up. Anyone have any suggestions/comments?

same here, i can go on bitstamp.net and it works fine. I'm trying to put the cookie info into the headers of the API request now, but not succeeding yet.
If anyone figures it out, please post here :)

I can highly recommend Kraken. Their EUR liquidity is picking up rapidly, their website is great and customer support has been a good experience for me. I've had bad experiences with Bitstamp too, it seems they've gotten pretty arrogant.

The number of bitcoins should be compared to the monetary base of the usd for example, not GDP.
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:02:33
But that means every commodity can be called a currency too, because it is not specifically banned anywhere?

Which laws apply to Internetistan? Don't local laws apply, depending on where the trade occured. I've been quite confused by this part of bitcoin.
