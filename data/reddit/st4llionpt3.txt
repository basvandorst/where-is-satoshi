 Ok that's interesting.  I suppose I'll need to find a tax expert out here in the "land of the free" so I'm not arrested for not paying tribute to our overlords. Thank you.

I believe that when you enter the recovery phrase into the new wallet, it will contain the same info as your previous wallet so there is no need to transfer to your new one.  Someone please tell me if I'm wrong.

I saw a report that compared the numbers in regards to student loan debt and those of the sub prime mortgage rates just before 2008 and they are frighteningly similar.  Sadly,  you are on to something.

Does silk road not count, or am I missing something?

 Learn something new every day! I'm not into that btw i use fiat for all my illicit dealings

 Aren't there still darknet sites that operate with bitcoin? Clearly we aren't experts on the subject, but i don't think it's as black and white as you're making it sound.

Not arguing that, but "Nobody, ever" implies that it hasn't happened in the past.

That's a good question.  I don't know about any of this, are there any good sources of info that anyone could recommend?  I'm planning on hodling for the foreseeable future, but this seems like something i should know. Would trading btc or b2x for eth or ltc incur a CGT, or is that strictly when selling for fiat?

 I just recently signed up at Aspiration bank, where they will reimburse all of your atm fees, worldwide. Also 1% interest on my checking account. What i like most about them is that instead of investing in oil and war, they are investing in solar and other renewable energies.  Signed up online and was easy to transfer money into it.

What about trading one crypto for another?  For example: I've been thinking about changing some of my bitcoin into LTC before the fork on GDAX.  Do I pay a CGT for that?

While i haven't yet received my refund(they process those on the 10th of every month), I've been assured by them that it will include bank fees incurred at all atms, worldwide.  I'll try to remember to update this next week, as I've been using my card outside of my country and am hopeful that i am right and you are wrong :p

 Thanks for that.  What an exciting month we have to look forward to!

It's in reference to Calvin Ayre, and i believe it was for running an offshore online gambling site, and only because he offered it to Americans.  Don't think he's on the list anymore.

 Well fudge me, thought i found myself a loophole. Thanks for your response. How tricky to calculate that though...

Ok, thanks.
