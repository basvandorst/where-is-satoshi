I have just added Bitcoin to the convertible currency list - [related issue](
Should be available in the [web-app]( now.
This is only a conversion to BTC, not satoshi's or bits - that requires a touch more work, but will be added soon - feature can be tracked [here](

The general instructions are as follows:
- Download and install [Better Touch Tool](
- Use the [Web App]( to create your toolbar, hit the export button once done.
- Open the BetterTouchTool application.
- In the bottom left corner go to "Manage Presets".
- Click the "Import" button and select the downloaded file.
Reach out if you have any questions though - happy to assist.
I'll [add Aion to the list]( - should be up shortly.

No Problem, thanks for trying it out - hope it helps!
If you encounter any issues or have any suggestions let me know. Couple of small improvements in the works already - check in with the [GitHub Repo]( for any changes I push out.

I am making use of the [cryptocompare API]( - their API will receive data from multiple exchanges. 
If I understand their spec correctly, on the API I am currently using - `pricemultifull` - they will serve the last data they received from any exchange. This could mean that inside my touch bar tool the price will fluctuate as each request could pick up a new exchange.
I believe I could move to an averaged approach (using `generateAvg`) which may give a more stable value, I'll look into this - however the price will always likely deviate site to site.

Seen a few touch bar implementations floating around - thought I would share my own.
People kept asking me to add new coins, colours and currency conversions so I thought I would build a web app so you can customise your own. 
Would be happy for feedback, contributions and suggestions - [source code]( and the [web app]( - requires [BetterTouchTool](
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:06:02
Sure! - [done](
Should be available on the [web-app]( now - may need to force a refresh for it to appear.
The [icon library]( I'm using doesn't appear to have an icon for it, so used a placeholder for now.

No, [BetterTouchTool]( runs in the background and can stay open at all times. The tab/web-app is just to customise the import to BetterTouchTool - change your colours, pick specific coins, pick your conversion currency - dollars, euros etc.

Very nice - not an OSX dev either but interested to see how a native version is built - I shall check it out!
I also felt inspired recently but took a different approach, [source code]( and the [web app]( - mine requires [BetterTouchTool]( though.

Did a bit of checking after your average question - can see my conversation with myself [here](
In short, looks like the price is already being averaged - I will look at adding a 'preferred exchange' going forward, but it comes with it's own troubles.
If you have a specific example of a coin, will be happy to have another dig around and watch cryptocompare vs coinmarketcap.

Nice! Does the application need to stay active for the touch bar to show? Is the source anywhere yet?
I also felt inspired recently - took a different approach though [source code]( and the [web app](

Luckily my part is [open source]( - you can check the code and would advise you do before running random internet scripts.
The template for the script that gets the price from the API can be found [here]( and looks like this in [applescript]( when populated and running a BTC/USD comparison.

I think the feature you mean is called a 'Button Group' in BetterTouchTool. Can enable it in my tool with the last checkbox in the options.

Looks like the [PR]( with that coin hasn't been merged yet so it wasn't picked up. 
That said - since you dug up my project and made a post about it, I've manually added it for you now ;) Should be available now - though I cannot test it directly without a device.
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:13:29
Oh hey! I made this :-)
I've been lacking dev time (and a mac with a touch bar) recently, but if anyone has any feature requests or problems, please do drop me a line on the [issues]( on GitHub.
There is a [video]( of it in use in an older post I made if anyone is interested.

I take the icons from [AllienWorks/cryptocoins]( so they need to be available there (or somewhere else). Unfortunately I have no artistic skill ;-)
