Well it had to have been the same person who wrote the original bitcoin manuscript.
I just envision "I am not Dorian Nakamoto" becoming a cult phrase like the one from fight club

My thoughts exactly.

this will be a movie guaranteed. I can't wait.
I think Newman from Seinfeld should play Mark Karpeles

so much of this volume is from short sells and probably naked shorting. people will have to get out sooner or later 
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:04:03
a squeeze is coming. just wait
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:15:21
i can get on board with that
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:00:06
it means the people who borrowed shares to sell will have to buy them back. They will undergo their own capitulation. Look at when I wrote this and the price at the time. I bought when I posted this and I'm at a healthy gain.
Bitcoin isn't going anywhere.

no, i genuinely liked it. makes sense. i am atheist. 
it was a bit of a non sequitur though
@_date: 2015-01-29 03:51:06
Well of course, that explains why copper is more valuable than gold!
@_date: 2015-01-22 04:40:29
just fyi those market cap numbers are wrong
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:14:04
yeah this is incredible
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:26:59
sounds good
@_date: 2015-01-16 23:36:13
haha this is fuckin great.
mr show was amazing
@_date: 2015-07-09 05:15:00
haha this is amazing
@_date: 2015-07-05 18:41:25
what is the point of that
@_date: 2015-07-05 18:33:02
Yeah this is concerning considering that the blocks on either side are nearly filled.
I don't fully understand how that is even possible to do deliberately
@_date: 2015-07-05 18:50:09
thanks for the info.
@_date: 2015-03-22 19:51:12
Haha this is so great. I love the persistence to keep up with all the negative press
@_date: 2015-03-10 04:26:57
no shit. me too.
We haven't even come close to seeing how bitcoin will change the way we live
@_date: 2015-03-02 07:46:48
he is right. The OTC markets do not undergo the same level of scrutiny and an investment on a major exchange
@_date: 2015-02-02 03:46:30
I'LL TAKE THEM THEN.
How about all unclaimed tips go to me. Sound good?
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:29:17
At first I thought that, but there are statements like "We need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier transactions." which obviously talk about we in the sense you describe.
In the context of the we that I cited above, there is no reason to include anyone but himself. If he were one person then it make no sense to write we for something he alone proposes.
But yeah, maybe just splitting hairs. Einstein took "c" literally which led him to discovering the theory of relativity, so why not do the same here

This is the NYDFS: 
@_date: 2015-03-10 04:10:06
thanks for this. Yeah not sure what the problem is. Volume stopped on me a couple hours ago
@_date: 2015-02-11 02:25:45
i'd rather play an unfair lottery game that was at least remotely fun

i think after decentralization as in after the birth of decentralization
