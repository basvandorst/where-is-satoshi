about 9% of the merchants keep it all :
merchants that keep some of it could be incredibly low amounts
about 4000 merchants out of about 50 000 merchants keep it all right? Some merchants do less than 5$ of btc transactions in a year and they still count as a merchant as much as the merchant that does lets say 2 million in a year.
Instead of giving us bs numbers why doesn't bitpay give us the percentage of the coins that are kept by merchants? 
All I'm trying to say is bitpay isn't as great as you think. Someones making billions off it: they take the 1% from merchants then they sell it right away on the markets at the +7% "standard" premium so they make 8% out of that million dollars a day so about 80k a day of profit for putting extreme downwards pressure on the btc price.

I downloaded an app on my phone called bitcoin map or bitcoin pro, it's an app with a list of restaurants that accept bitcoin. theres 2 in my city that i never heard about even after looking it up...

Ive been there twice already, their food was alright but it seems like they try to find the dumbest waitresses by purpose!
First time, this girl didn't know basic math on how to double-check the conversion from btc to cad and 2nd time, the waitress was pretty bitchy and when came the time to pay, she was bitching at us and her coworker saying she doesn't want to pay for our meals if the transaction doesn't go through and wouldn't calm down. The standard tavern in ottawa accepts bitcoin and is 13456378238 times better!! The owner of mtl poutine should take a little drive and pay them a little visit. 
tl;dr mtl poutine is kinda shitty, The standard tavern is the best place I've spent my bitcoins at for food/drinks

Most Montreal Bitcoiners hate the bitcoin embassy because they're all douchebags and very  bad people. Just saying. 
It's not because you got rich from being an early adopter that you should run for the btc foundation.
If anyone is ever in montreal, go to the embassy, look at all their neighbouring businesses that know nothing about bitcoin while lots of merchants are starting to accept it in the city. You'll see how they're pretty douchey people and give off a pretty bad image about bitcoin.
They do nothing to help the acceptance of bitcoin in montreal and make it even harder for local emerging bitcoin startups here because they're just greedy fucks that like to sit on their asses and wait for the moon

What's worse for the price than "miners" dumping the coins is Bitpay!!!
Everytime you use your btc through whoever accepts btc and wants it in fiat, those coins are dumped on the market and I'm pretty sure more coins are sold by bitpay than all the miners worldwide every day.
Then you say : not everyone accepting btc turns it into fiat right away
^ if as a merchant you want to keep it in btc, why go through bitpay where you lose 1% and technically pay 1% for super shitty customer service
I just wanted to point out the main thing that hasn't been said so far in this thread. I have no stats to back this but I'm pretty sure bitpay puts more downward pressure on the price than miners do

First off, dollar is backed by demand. Bitcoin is also backed by demand for the asset, not much difference here other than one being too big to fail and the other one makes too much sense to ever fail.
2nd, easy to bash a country for not having the gold standard even tho it's TERRIBLE for economic growth. Basic economics. We bounce the hell out of recessions now compared to when we were under the gold standard.
If we were all under the gold standard the world economy wouldn't be what it is now. Also, gold is just a metal like others. Gold is only worth what we make it worth like bitcoin or fiat.

The debate is over OP. You’re 2 years late on this. Maybe Gavin meant that he started working on a coin backed by scammers? Bcash is proven to be a shitcoin, I still might have a couple on my trezor I haven’t used in a while and I’ll gladly dump them on you if you’re still buying into a debunked scam. SV is more bitcoin than bcash. Even fkn DOGE has more on-chain volume and less fees than bcash. According to what these scammers had to say back then when pushing their coin, dogecoin is the real bitcoin. It’s what bch wishes it was (minus the scam part)
@_date: 2019-11-17 05:45:56
What I meant is the people pushing it are full blown scammers (aside from Gavin). Takes away all the legitimacy of the coin. Why do you think they were pushing it so hard and spent billions inflating the price? Bcash started the whole shitcoin scams. 
All the other 30+ bitcoin forks also have the characteristics, why do t you buy those scamcoins too OP?

You really think no ones gonna use oil in 10 years??? Did you know that electric cars are total garbage in winter condition? I remember last winter, about -40C/F when a fist fight broke in front of a restaurant near my work because these morons decided to take their electric cars at to the restaurant during their lunch break and didn't have enough juice to get back to work and theres only 1 charging station at that restaurant. 
The price of oil will keep going up and there will still be a demand for gasoline powered cars even in 50 years unless theres ground-breaking improvement on batteries. The cold kills batteries so quick.
What is fucking over Venezuela so much is the American economic sanctions and no one seems to mention that here. If it wasn't for the sanctions, venezuela would be the saudi of america. Pegging it to oil is the best thing they can do since they have so much of it...

Yes it is. Don’t buy ASICS. Go for gpu mining, take used parts as much as possible. Easy to break even then you can sell the GPUs because they hold a lot more value than ASICS. Gamers will buy them in the worst case. Electricity costs aren’t that bad if you’re mining like 8$ worth per day on nicehash (less than 1$ per day) and odds are that your GPUs won’t lose more than 100$ each within a year. If there’s another shitcoin boom, you’ll easily sell those GPUs at a few hundred bucks profit tho

You’re investing in gold wrong dude. Gold only goes up during recessions, then goes down as stocks start to pick up. Now that stocks are starting to decline, you should hold on to your gold instead of dumping it right before it gets pumped. 
Now for manipulation, it’s much much much easier to manipulate bitcoin, given the market cap of btc vs gold. Also, a ton of gold isn’t mined yet but there’s less and less available... kind of like what bitcoin will be in 100 years. 
Basic rules of investing is knowing where an when to shift from stocks/bonds/gold. You can’t do the wrong moves then say it’s manipulated... the stock market is easier to manipulate than the price of gold ffs.

Sister's bf in Canada works for BMO. Since October, BMO's fraud department was overwhelmed by criminals stealing credit card info and buying bitcoin with them... The real reason they're blocking all these transaction is because their fraud department is unable track down the criminals getting free bitcoins. When people go shopping with stolen credit cards at least their faces are on cameras and they leave traces. They're just making it harder for criminals. If someone wants bitcoins, they will find a way to get them (and it's not that hard, think back to 3-4 years ago before all these exchanges even existed). You can still buy BTC-backed securities through BMO's investing accounts.
Imagine how stupid BMO would look admitting thousands of customers got frauded and btc was bought with their hard-earned money and there's nothing BMO can do to stop them....
 "you can't buy bitcoin for your own security" = "our system is insecure and most of our customer's data is compromised"
Pretty ironic

If all your money is in btc than why do you want more btc? HODL what you got ffs its not time to be greedy... 0.1btc is all you need if this goes to the moon... and if it doesn't, well having 100000btc won't make you any richer. 
Look at it in this perspective : if every american wanted 0.1btc, there wouldn't be enough for everyone... having over 1btc is way more than enough (unless you have spare income and willing to risk it which is not your case :p)

Apple only started paying dividends in like 2011. Good luck reinvesting that dividend that barely covers inflation (1.57% per year if you buy the stock right now)
Your friend is a dumbass. Dividends are not worth it. "reinvesting" your dividends = a free pay check for your bank : paying more brokerage fees than the money you're actually gonna make off it unless you're playing with the 6-7 figures.
That 7 years of 1-2$ per stock every year is such a great deal right? Also consider all those shitcoins forking off btc a dividend. Bcash was a good 15% "dividend" on bitcoin.... Do the math, 15% in dividends is probably what AAPL paid so far in dividends ever since they started paying out dividends. 
22$ in '78 is around 50$ in todays money. lets be extremely generous and say  say that 50$ turned into 10 000$ worth of stocks after 43 years (all brokerage fees aside + your 200$ of dividends over the years) = 10200$. Theres not much math that needs to be done. (from 22$ to 15k in 40 years to be extremely generous vs lets say you bought bitcoin 4 years ago at 22$ and you sold at 20k  (not counting the dividends of shitcoins we all got that we traded in for free bitcoins).
Tell your friend that dividends are only worth it for the 1% because if I'm not mistaken, in the US you don't pay income taxes on dividend income (to avoid double taxation). With $100k you'll be getting 1.5k-2k per year in dividends with inflation accounted for, your 100k + dividends is probably worth 99k after a year if the stocks value doesn't go up that year. Such a great investment right?


Your friend doesn't know how dividends work. A company only starts paying out dividends when they reached their peak and don't have much room to grow, otherwise (like in apples first 35 years, every penny of profit is re invested by the company to expand operations and promote company growth). Also, general rule : higher dividends = higher stock price so you're not making much money on your reinvested dividends. You basically need 62 shares worth of dividends to be able to buy 1 more share of apples stock. 
Dont argue with your friend, tell him to at least take a class on basic finance and he might understand how stupid his arguments are.
TL;DR Dividends are only worth it if you have millions of dollars invested and if you're reinvesting those dividends on a flat trade fee with those large sums of money over the years, ASSUMING the stock price will keep going in value. Oh and also, your friend is a dumbass.
Edit; my numbers are probably all off and slightly exaggerated but i hope you get the point

Buying apple in 2001 after the dotcom bubble popped would've been the stupidest idea in the world. 
Edit : Or the smartest? ;)

With the +10% fee?
@_date: 2018-07-27 04:15:00
Mutual funds take a 5% "managing" fee. 5% fee + 2% inflation = 7%  which is roughly the yearly average return on the best diversified portfolio. 
Most people are switching to ETF's btw and so should you. Mutual funds are only for people that don't know any better

no he's right. 
Lets say were at 15mil btc right now with lets say 1000btc/day created.
At the halving, lets say were at 18 million btc in circulation with 500 new btc. Yes, the daily new supply is lower but the total supply only gets bigger every day, so there is more total supply in the end. 
Take the average yearly price instead of the short-term daily price, it's only been on a decrease because there is less demand (i'm not talking about volume because day traders make those numbers bias)
Smaller demand with a lot of new supply = lower price.
even with halving, there is still new supply (think of it as central banks printing money and causing inflation. There is no logical reason why printing half the amount will cause a deflation. If everything stays the same, it would just cut the inflation  rate by half.)
Don't forget the nov 2013 bubble only happened because of WillyBot

It doesn't work that way at all. I recommend a trezor or a ledger nano as a wallet since you seem to be a newbie. No wallet can be pinned down to a specific country because wallets can travel :)
Maybe you mean an exchange where you can buy btc that is based in another country?

I'm pretty sure it was intentionally made like this to promote bcash. I have a feeling that Roger is running this website too
@_date: 2018-04-23 16:22:00
It's not about promotion it's about having a functional coin. Even doge has more on-chain transactions than BCH with 0 advertising from Roger. If you can't beat dogecoin at their own game, you're a shit-tier shitcoin

2012, Also 10$ for a pin? Too poor to afford it because I'm still hodling :)
@_date: 2018-04-09 01:33:05
Exactly. Get ready to get them them in a few months and shipped to you in a year after they’re not as profitable 
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:30:59
If you look at the market cap, bitcoin is already bigger than Tesla :)
@_date: 2018-04-28 05:07:44
took 2 hours for the most obvious question. I'm really curious if there actually was any funds on there too... cuz you know, what if you're a noob and get free money? :)
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:20:13
Beating Roger at his own game. I love it
@_date: 2018-04-24 05:47:14
and no, you need to buy the btc somewhere and get them sent to your address on your trezor
@_date: 2018-04-23 16:19:51
The whole r/btc subreddit is a troll subreddit. They didn't have to ban me, I left on my own. It's hard to deal with a community of tin-foiled brainwashed flat-earthers who fall for scams this easily.
Also, Bitcoin Core is to bitcoin what Bitcoin ABC is to bcash. All you retarded fuckers need to start trolling with facts is you want minimum credibility. Bitcoin Core is not a cryptocurrency, it's like if I referred to bitcoin as BIP48 or something like that : how retarded would I look? 
@_date: 2018-04-09 23:38:48
This is ridiculous. I’m doing a bachelors in finance and not even 1% of my class mates are even considering crypto currencies. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 05:43:04
Buy btc on localbitcoins.com or set up an account on an exchange. The premium you pay on loclabitcoins might be worth it if you live in a heavily regulated area. Pay in cash and leave no trace ;)

shitty garage exchange with 2 million$ worth of btc??
id love to own a "shitty garage exchange" lol
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:02:28
We don’t sell. But for those of us who do, we know ppl buying/selling for cash. And of course there’s exchanges but it takes a while to get approved and you should only find your exchange account right before selling cuz bad things happen when you leave your btc on exchanges

I thought everyone stopped playing runescape in 2006 :p

No. US and Canadian app stores had them removed for 6 months. If you had the app beforehand you were fine tho. Kind of like flappy bird
@_date: 2019-05-20 00:53:42
Happened to me lol. Still not bothering to get a new one until btc is in the 7 figures :)
I can always back it up using my seed but I’m too lazy
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:36:05
Get a trezor. It’s gonna stop working 3 months after you buy it then you’ll be forced to hodl
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:47:13
yeah but if they're the same price id rather have more hashing power per $ :p 
@_date: 2019-05-19 02:11:07
Meh wtv. Life goes on. As long as still have a few it doesn’t matter. The difference between 1 million dollars and 10 million dollars is pretty negligible from my perspective of a working class citizen :)

I’ve lost the keys to an address that had 8 bitcoins in 2013 so there’s at least 8 bitcoins lost :)
@_date: 2015-02-02 05:49:28
^ makes sense
This would be a great opportunity to give my first tip but idk how that reddit tip works :p worst case you can pm me one of your addresses - too lazy to read changetip's long paragraphs, they need a TL;DR on that shit

Institutions also believe bitcoin bad. Also, TA only works half the time. It’s like using stats to predict the next number at roulette. It works sometimes but at the end of the day it’s the same odds at every spin.
@_date: 2019-05-01 22:23:54
I’m talking about trying to find patterns in things that don’t have any patterns. Then you start finding patterns inside your made up patterns and think they work.
@_date: 2015-02-10 04:47:39
I'm in no rush at all to buy more, I have a pretty good feeling the price is going to continue going down in the next few months. But i won't miss the boat :) didn't miss the moon last time, probably won't miss it again, and if i do miss it, i still have 25btc i got in 2012 :)
@_date: 2019-05-09 12:48:35
Yea like in 2015 when they banned every single bitcoin wallet off the App Store.

To and the ONLY way to determine who is right is try and reduce the mining reward with a soft fork and hard fork and see which one wins... Theres so much money at stake here that its worth it.
