It isn't much condolence, but I too lost the remainder of the funds I had mined so many years ago when it was ~$1/coin. I have no idea why I put that last chunk in Inputs.io, but I was busy with real-life work and neglected to then further investigate. I should have definitely known better, but I also was hoping maybe the BTC service community wasn't overflowing with scammers still. Proven wrong once again and I will guarantee there was no "hack". TF &amp; Co stole them all. 
Sure would be nice if someone lifted that veil of anonymity.

While true, it really limits the usability of bitcoin. The idea is for it to actually be spent, not hoarded by everyone offline in complicated paper wallets.

I know it won't make you feel much better but when I first jumped into BTC years ago I mined ~4500 coins and bought ~4500 coins. I had them both stored in cold wallets on USB sticks. At the time, they were only worth pennies. For whatever reason, I didn't secure and e-mail a backup to myself or store it digitally somewhere else. Months later (price was still in the toilet comparatively) one of the USB sticks was destroy by my gf &amp; my's new puppy while the two of them were playing together. 
The puppy is now over 3 years old. The best &gt;$1 million USD puppy I've ever owned...

I think the difference is helplessness. If someone were to come into my house and steal money out of my mattress (or fire proof safe) at least I have more personal control over the thwarting of said thieves. Honestly, if they make it through the dogs, myself, and the safe they probably deserve what they are getting.
I also think it hurts more because we all know it was just an inside job.

I'm not sure if this makes any difference, but 2 days ago I sent two transactions from my inputs.io wallet to my coinlender's account. 0.11 and 0.63 BTC. Neither have shown up and I have e-mailed TF's e-mail. This was well before any inputs.io hack stuff. I'm not sure if this means anything but I do find it odd.
The wallet I sent the money to on Inputs.io from Blockchain was:
I then sent it from inputs.io to coinlender's using the coinlender's website on 11/5 and it never made it into my account (granted, the balance in my coinlender's account also hasn't updated since 11/5--something to do with the hack?) 
Either way, I assume any balance in inputs.io is gone as well as coinlender's account (even though it should technically not be affected?)
