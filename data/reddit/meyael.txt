I mean you could never deposit it into your account and never buy anything in cash over 10k and you could win. It's just not easy.

I imagine the string of letter by 'Recipient Instructions/Message' basically links to my GDAX account so they know what funds go where?

I could be wrong but what I understand as my own thoughts about this. People were probably hoping for a dip so no reason to buy at some arbitrary 11.9k number. As it hits a milestone like 12k I am sure people panic buy as the price drastically jumps up and down and do not want to feel like they missed out if it continues to climb with the thoughts it wont come back down.

I was strictly speaking for turbo tax, however if what you say is true I am slightly shocked that they have capital gains under basic filing. I would definitely go to a CPA if I earned tens of thousands from this.

The IRS always wins, assuming he is in the US.

The way this guy capitalized all of his 'MY's" reminds me of that J.G. Wentworth commercial. 
It's his money and he needs it NOW!

Good thing I sold my millions of WoW currency before having to claim ownership and taxes! /s

Rolling for the chance. Merry Christmas.

Depending on what you originally bought in at and you sell right before that price you risk the possibility of it never actually dipping below your price. Sure we have been seeing declines pretty steadily so you can assume all you want and speculate. However, lets say you bought at 12k and sell at 12.5k just to be safe. Be prepared for the possibility that as you sell it stops going down and goes up instead. Making you lose potential profits, and making your next buy in worth less.

It may be free or cost like $50 to file your taxes, but I don't think they think of having capital gains under basic use.

I got in at 16.5k I knew what I was getting into. I am not afraid.

Previously when I had multi state income I was not considered basic anymore. That is why I find it shocking.

Never put in more than you are willing to lose. I bought at 16.5k and I can't say I am happy that it's below the price but I am not in any risk. I am not anxious, I will not lose sleep, I will not go broke.
I believe we will get there again, maybe not next week but eventually.

What's hard for me to get over is if bitcoin goes to 20k than my 100 dollars just becomes 200. At the same time in what world is an investment going to double your money in what looks like at this point a few months from now with no effort. 
Its time to buy though. I'll always regret when I looked at it years ago but that's a story told by many. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:24:10
Serious noob question. I feel like throwing 100-200 dollars a month just doesn't seem like much. How wrong am I? I want to get started.

The way I see it is a glorified savings account that has a much higher expected APY than a real one at a bank that I'd get a penny. I can always pull out if I'm in a jam. I'm smart with finances do I believe that I'll be good. 
The issue I have with putting in so little compared to what a single bitcoin is worth is that growth needs to be pretty high to be substantial. If I have 100 than I get 200 when it reaches 20k it's just hard to rationalize but at the end of the day it's still a higher rate than banks.

As a Crypto Finance Expert myself, my expert well educated opinion on the matter is that Bitcoin will go somewhere at some point.
