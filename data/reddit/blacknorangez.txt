The web interface of an Antminer S9. He has it set up at home to mine as part of a pool, where a lot of people combine their hashrate together and then divide up the reward if they find a block. 
His machine found a block within 11 days! (The converted reward for a block is ~$150k.) Unfortunately, that is shared among everyone in the pool. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:33:05


Which part?
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:50:23


Well I suppose that's true in the indirect sense. Segwit did *cause* the hard fork, though I agree that's not what the author had in mind. 


This is subjective. Of course from the technical perspective, Bitcoin Cash is the fork, nobody can deny that. In the more ideological perspective, obviously Bitcoin Core is the fork in that it has fundamentally altered the nature and ambition of the project while Bitcoin Cash preserves and continues it. Again, I agree that this is not likely what the author had in mind. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:53:58


I would hope you do. Better to overestimate the time and have clients pleasantly surprised their transaction only took 3 days instead of a week, rather than telling them it will take 1 hour and have them spamming support for the next 3 days until it confirms. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:32:01
How can someone be "Holy crap" over a change to the difficulty retargeting algorithm, yet not at all "Holy crap" over Segwit and co?
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:59:37


That has nothing to do with the part you quoted. I even explicitly acknowledged that the Cash chain is the fork in the technical sense. My point was that, in the ideological sense, the Core chain is the fork; the current Core philosophy is incompatible with the principles and roadmap of Bitcoin up until about 2014, where expanding blocksize in line with usage requirements, and a focus on fast, cheap, reliable transactions as a digital currency were prioritised. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:33:10


Unfortunately for you, I looked up the context, in which it becomes clear that this was a comparison to existing attempts at digital currencies whereby "double-spending" has a slightly different meaning to the way we often use it in Bitcoin. He is describing his solution, which is *the blockchain*, not every person running a full node in order to be able to participate in the economy. 
I'm sure you're aware that Satoshi was a proponent of SPV clients and pruned nodes, which clearly contradicts your assertion. 
Let [Satoshi himself]( address your concern:






Also [this](


Tell me, honestly, what proportion of Bitcoin users you believe run a full node. Can you explain to me how the 99.99% who don't, including the large proportion of them who wouldn't even know the meaning of the term, are realistically vulnerable to a double-spending attack? 


I doubt there are many people who have any issues with 2nd layer technology. Certainly the libertarian crowd (who seem to be on the Cash side) would be in full support of it, it's nobody else's business what you build on top of Bitcoin. Even Roger Ver, and I'm sure I can guess your opinion of him, has said multiple times that he is not against the implementation of Lightning on the Cash chain, noting that it would probably be *better* on Cash. 
What we are against is the apparent deliberate crippling of Bitcoin itself in order to contrive a necessity for these 2nd layer solutions. If the blocksize was scaled as planned, maintaining cheap and fast transactions, then I'm not sure there would be much demand at all for Lightning. 


Well the first part is clearly untrue but whatever helps you sleep at night. I completely agree with the latter, same for the Core chain and all of the alts. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:29:37
Out of curiosity, would *any* change whatsoever still be considered "Bitcoin" to you, as long as it is compatible with an earlier client? Is that the metric? If some ungodly change that is completely antithetical to the Bitcoin ideology could be implemented tomorrow in such a way that the current client is 'unaware' of it, does that change nothing, in your view? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:58:45

@_date: 2017-12-21 05:15:44
Well, it hardly started today. The anger and bullshit directed toward Roger Ver is absolutely extraordinary, and it has been going on for a while. 
If a man advises another to do something, and then does the complete opposite himself, I don't think it's controversial to question his motives for that advice. Ver emphasised that he's free to do whatever he wants, there's no crime there. That behaviour is certainly very suspicious though, and I would hope people aren't so blinded by their preference for Bitcoin Core or Litecoin that they can't even acknowledge that. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:06:26


Well that's not really an answer. I'm sure he did want that, but he was much more specific. A spork has real purpose and use but it's not Bitcoin!
Are you implying that *any* change is compatible with Satoshi's vision, as long as it improves real purpose and use? So a fork that has significantly diverged from the whitepaper but which has greater merchant adoption, higher transaction volume, etc (or however you define purpose and use) would be more true to Satoshi's Bitcoin than a fork which strictly adheres to the economic and cryptographic principles explicitly set out in his comments and the whitepaper? 
(In case it's not clear, I'm not being facetious or accusatory. Genuine interest.)
I don't even really promote Bitcoin Cash. You can check my post history if you like, and even in this exchange I haven't stated a position either way until now when pressed. I do promote libertarianism, and for that reason I prefer Bitcoin Cash as I believe it to much more strongly represent the economic and libertarian principles that are important to me and which I believe to be the foundations for its success. I have a lot of Bitcoin Core and a lot of Bitcoin Cash so I have a financial interest in both (I understand that it's very likely that at least one will crash hard, and that's ok). As long as economic freedom wins and people achieve greater liberty from central banks and the governments/Jews pulling their strings, I don't particularly care which fork "wins", whether that be Core, Cash, any other Bitcoin fork, or even an altcoin.
So no, I'm definitely not being paid, in fact I'm ready and willing to lose millions to see crypto succeed. Ideally Bitcoin, but I fear Core is straying from the light. So there you go, I hope that clears up my integrity.

(...and of course I screwed up and replied to myself. @_date: 2017-12-21 03:56:42
If there's a run on Bitcoin, he's absolutely right that it would be better to be on an exchange already than join the queue of hundreds of thousands of transactions that could take weeks to clear (if at all, if hash rate drops fast enough). And that's exactly what he was walking about.

There are a lot of "gangsters" just like me who simply believe that it's prudent to stick to the libertarian and economic principles upon which Bitcoin was founded. Bitcoin's elegant simplicity is what has made me such a strong and passionate supporter for years now, and I have significant concerns over any attempt to undermine that with radical protocol changes. 
I don't believe for a moment that increasing the blocksize from 'tiny' to 'very small' will centralise mining any more than it already is. I seriously doubt that even 1% of the people on this sub run a full node, let alone a full mining node. I don't believe that any of them would be incapable of accessing an internet connection or hard drive that would be able to handle this small increase, and I am certain that none of them would be better off financially as the lower fees would offset the cost of a hard drive soon enough (assuming they actually use their Bitcoin!).

One of the biggest indicators of Bitcoin's divergence from its original libertarian foundations is the acceptance, compliance, and even request for government taxation and regulation that we now see in the community.

This is what 2X was. Everyone was *begging* Core to do this only a couple months ago, and yet it was fiercely resisted. I don't know how they could possibly go back on that now whilst retaining any shred of credibility or authority. 
All of the quotes, all of the vitriol, all of the centralisation FUD would come back to bite them so hard that it would turn Bitcoin Core into a laughing stock. It's simply impossible at this point.
And, frankly, if it ever got to that point where they literally could not withstand a blocksize increase any longer, I think the question people would be asking is not "What use case is there for BCash?" but rather "What use case is there for BCore?"

Do Core supporters even really deny this?
My impression was that Bitcoin has *deliberately* diverged from this vision in some ways, due to the perceived shortsightedness from Satoshi. The emphasis on small blocksize, for example, is generally considered to be an area where Core is trusted to know better (with the benefit of time) than Satoshi who didn't believe that larger blocks ought to be so fiercely resisted. 
On what points exactly would you consider Bitcoin to be more authentic with respect to Satoshi's vision than Bitcoin Cash?

His point was that the beef itself could potentially be from a beast of such poor health that this could somehow be transmitted to the consumer. This is ridiculous. I'd be curious to know these hormones and antibiotics which are so harmful to humans and yet remain legal and accepted in the beef industry, if you'd care to share. I'm especially keen to learn how they survive the processing and cooking without denaturation.
Please understand that I'm not denying that most takeaway food is unhealthy, but not for the reason cited. Even then, you could argue that occasional consumption would have a negligible impact on a person's health over their lifetime; having one puff on a cigarette once a week would never harm anyone, but it's the people smashing a pack per day that on a fast track to the grave.

You're right, I don't understand your point. Because it makes no sense.


It's not censoring. They are opting to no longer *advertise* a sub that censors discussion. They have no obligation to partner with or advertise that particular subreddit at all. They have every right to withdraw it from the sidebar if it is considered to no longer share values that supports.


Censorship is not a significant problem because reddit is a "free market" where anyone can create a sub to compete with the poor quality one. And that is what happened. And that is why people in that thread are suggesting alternate Bitcoin subs to advertise instead. They are considered superior as they share values important to (ie. not censoring).

I used to be in the same industry. PayPal is nightmarish of course, which I'm sure you've learned over and over again. 
My saviour came in the form of Moneybookers, now Skrill. I have yet to have any issues with them whatsoever. Looking back now I realise how amazingly refreshing it was to be left alone for a change; it seemed I was on the phone to PayPal regularly trying to sort shit out but never getting anywhere, whereas with Skrill I could've been forgiven for forgetting which payment processor I was using. They never troubled me, never hassled me, just allowed me to conduct my business. 
I used Bitcoin for very few people with whom I was frequently transacting (such as wholesalers who you are getting the content from, or staff if you have any). I think it is good for this purpose, but if you expect it to be effective for one-time or infrequent customers then I think you'll have a bad time. Bitcoin is simply nowhere near popular enough yet. 
@_date: 2016-03-20 03:48:57
My example was poor. Let me refine my point.
The issue they take with this sub is that it censors discussion that conflicts with the ideology of mods here. There is no open discussion. 
So, my example of was a bad one because its position is clearly defined as being pro-Sanders. If, for example, a sub that ought to be neutral and welcoming of all political discussion, such as was to allow only pro-Sanders submissions and censor any discussion about other candidates, then it may warrant removal from a sister subreddit where the mods determine that to be contrary to their prioritisation of open and free speech.
As I understand it, for example, allows discussion of any Bitcoin-related news or views. This is aligned with the tolerant and welcoming ideology of mods, as opposed to the restrictive nature of this one. This sub no longer cherishes those values (or perhaps never did and the ancap mods mistakenly believed it did) and so it has strayed from the position that originally warranted a position in the sidebar. 
I maintain that they have no obligation to have *any* subs in the sidebar at all. I don't know why anyone feels ought to have any inherent right to a place there indefinitely. They could have no Bitcoin-related subs in there at all, if they choose. Or they could pick one(s) that align with their views, if they choose. It's my opinion that, if they are to share any sub at all, then advertising one that values a diverse range of opinions, without mod restrictions to guide the narrative, is a sound choice. 
@_date: 2016-03-19 14:03:51
It's a poor point. How is *not advertising* a subreddit equivalent to *censoring*? Why do they have any obligation to advertise any specific sub?

At the risk of sounding facetious, why do you suppose that a sheep, for example, isn't producing lambs that randomly range in intelligence from drowning in their food troughs to communicating with humans? It's not genetic, right? So if we raise a piglet in a loving two-parent White Christian middle class family where all its needs are met, it will grow to be a clever porker, surely? 
I have a few siblings myself, given all the same opportunities, and I can tell you we all knew from an early age how relatively smart we were compared to each other. And there was a huge range. 
Or imagine a typical primary school class. Imagine it's in an area where all of the students are approximately equal in their socio-economic status. I guarantee you could ask those kids about who is smart and who isn't in their class, and they'll all answer consistently. Remember back to school yourself, and you know there were those kids who were super sharp and got everything straight away and there are kids who need the most basic concepts explained over and over again. 
Consider that there are child prodigies and maestros in all sorts of fields, and there are wealthy, loving, caring, attentive parents with children of the same age sucking their thumbs and struggling to count into double figures. 
Of course environment is a big factor, but denying that genetics isn't also is absurd. Suggesting that genetics is not a factor at all is completely mad.

A couple notable bits:




This is a relatively recent article that seems to do a great job of reporting fairly what has happened over the last few years as the federal banks of countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Italy have been under pressure from taxpayer representatives to prove ownership of US-based gold reserves, and return it home to their own vaults. There were some bizarre irregularities initially which have lended credibility to the suspicions of doubters (eg. immediately melting down the small amount returned from the US and recasting), but to be fair it seems things are smoothing out now and they are successfully having a lot of the gold returned to their own vaults.
I liked the anecdote about the German fed president visiting the New York Fed in 1920 to inspect their reserves, only to eventually be informed that "we can’t find the Reichsbank gold". His reply: "Never mind; I believe you when you say the gold is there. Even if it weren’t you are good for its replacement." Fucking wow.

For the paranoid among us, use even more passphrases then. Have a few panic passwords, load each one up with exponentially increasing amounts of BTC and hope their arm is cramping from beating the shit out of you before they get to the all important one.
Let's be real here, very few people are ever going to find themselves being held up by a thug in their own home. Then most such thugs are going to be much more interested in the $100 in your wallet than the 100 BTC potentially in your Trezor. And then even if they did happen to have an understanding of bitcoin and Trezor and threatened you to unlock it, there is absolutely no way within reason (assuming even the slightest effort at good practice on your behalf) that they could determine how much is on there. Reluctantly offer up a passphrase that reveals a few bitcoin and they'll consider it a huge payday. In the extremely unlikely event that they then understand Trezor well and demand you enter the 'real' passphrase, enter another with ~10 BTC in it (very reluctantly). And your hundreds, protected by the super secure passphrase, are still entirely safe. The likelihood of getting this far is so slim I have ZERO genuine concern that it will ever happen to me.

Trezor offers protection from this kind of attack. Just keep a small percentage encrypted with a different passphrase. When someone twists your nuts enough (try to make it look like you're not enjoying it) simply 'relent' and tell them your panic password. They type in "password123" and get access to your Bitcoin... 5% of it anyway.

That's completely incorrect. I'm not even quite sure where to start...
When you pay for that coffee, you create and broadcast a transaction which says you want to move some Bitcoin to Starbucks' address. No funds actually move anywhere until a miner includes that in a block, which could take weeks depending on congestion and the fee you've set (it may even *never* be included if miners ignore it).
The Bitcoin does not sit in the mempool, the transaction does. Your client software will make everything look pretty by subtracting that amount from your balance and making sure not to spend those specific Bitcoin in another transaction, but they're still certainly under your control. 
You could walk outside the coffee shop and create another transaction which spends those *same* Bitcoin to a different address, such as another of your own. If a miner includes that transaction instead of the one to Starbucks, then you keep the money and Starbucks gets nothing. Indeed, now with RBF - Replace By Fee - Bitcoin is *designed* to work this way.

My impression is that most businesses that accept bitcoin only "accept" bitcoin in the sense that they are more than happy for people to pay with it so long as there's a convenient way to immediately convert that into dollars. They don't give a shit about bitcoin, they don't care what people pay with so long as a third party is happy to take it off their hands and instantly give them the equivalent in fiat. 
My point is that there is only a minor inconvenience (setting up to take bitcoin payments) and everything thereafter is a benefit. Many people will go there specifically because they can pay with bitcoin. 
So tell me why any business would be against accepting bitcoin (except banks)? The manager could be a hardcore buttcoiner and laugh their arses off every time a person comes in waving around their Mycelium app, but they're still not going to say no to $$$, which is exactly what they end up with a few seconds after the transaction.

I think a part of the price is the "premium" factor, like how those Dre headphones cost a lot more than the sum of their parts. 
And it has worked. Trezor is *the* hardware wallet now; synonymous. Any competitors are seen by many as generic brand Trezors, perhaps being met with comments like "oh, so it's a Trezor?" 
On a side note, I may as well chip in here with my own experience. I have one and I LOVE it. They are brilliant little things and make me feel infinitely more secure than before I bought mine (people in here would have a fucking stroke if they saw the way I was keeping my Bitcoin, and how much of it, pre-Trezor).

I like the sentiment but I'm not sure what makes you think that benevolent central planners ought to influence this by enforcing a cap on how many such transactions can be made. Why do they have any say in the calculation of the cost to the world vs the benefit to the user? How do you quantify this? Isn't this a private matter between the miner and the user? Isn't mining exactly how the market determines this cost to the world vs benefit, and so doesn't an artificial cap distort this? 
If your argument is that there needs to be some cap to prevent spam (as this threatens to increase the 'cost to the world'), isn't it clear that the cap is so low right now as to hamper its legitimate use for many honest people? Shouldn't this cap be somewhere comfortably between a size that allows all honest users to transact without unreasonable barriers and the size at which spam begins to pose a problem? Isn't this ideal size currently larger than 1mb?

That's true, nothing could stop Cash proponents upgrading. It does seem to have perverted the goals of some very influential people with power over Core development, which is unfortunately very concentrated in the one repo.
I may have the time wrong, I suppose this has been dragging on for a while. First 6 years then?

@_date: 2018-02-08 06:17:14
You really need to separate the idea of a Bitcoin fork and a software fork.
The exact same software can create a Bitcoin fork. Completely different software built from the ground up can mine on the same chain.
Consider those two facts, hopefully they'll part the clouds for a moment. There can be forks in the *blockchain*, and there can be forks in whatever *software* people are using to interact with it. Fundamentally different things. 


I don't even know where you've pulled that from. Did that make sense to you when you typed it? 


Haha. Very open source. Thankfully Bitcoin is a completely free concept without any leaders or central authorities, so I can ignore your silly definitions and fork/run whatever the hell I like. And so can you! You're more than welcome to ignore the Cash chain if you like. 


I don't know what this means either. On to what? I support the Cash chain, I think it's a far better concept and is objectively more true to the Bitcoin design and philosophy that made me and many others so feverishly optimistic about its future years ago. I haven't hidden that, have I? You haven't uncovered anything, I think I've been fairly honest and transparent. 
I hope, for the good of Bitcoin, that the Cash chain wins out. I think it will. 


Oh and this sort of stuff, too. It's nuts. It's not an argument at all, so you can keep repeating it all you like but it's not going to convince anyone. Along with all the typos, you're coming across a little low-IQ. 
I know it's tough but you have to *actually* provide the argument. You can't just skip ahead to the victory speech. 
So far all I've seen from you is this borderline-insane insistence that forking a Bitcoin client on github completely discredits the chain that it intends to accept as valid. Even if we put aside how egregiously this misses the entire point of Bitcoin, who cares? If I fork the Bitcoin Core client on github right now and edit it slightly so that it still operates on the Core chain, does that make the Core chain invalid? Do you believe there can be only one client for Bitcoin?
Or are you starting to comprehend how forks of clients and chains are *completely different things*? 
Or how about this... Since you're so obsessed with the open source aspect, what if a client forked the Core repository, maintained a full list of attributions (including to "Bitcoin Core") and renamed itself to something clearly different? Like "Bitcoin ABC"? 
Isn't that in accordance with the open source licensing? Correct me if I'm wrong, you're clearly much more passionate about this than I am. So what's the issue?

This is the bit you're not quite getting. There's no deceit, the Cash chain is seen by many as Bitcoin. They're not trying to fool anyone, they're not trying to scam anyone, they're just honestly assessing each chain on its merits and have determined that Cash has the more legitimate claim to the title in their view; that the Core chain has diverged significantly from the philosophy and ambitions of Bitcoin and no longer meets the criteria. They would agree that it's very confusing for newcomers and lament that situation probably even more than you do. 
Somebody else tried to conflate the software 'fork' with the Bitcoin 'fork' too. Similar terms, but different meanings. My reply is here if you have any interest: @_date: 2018-02-18 08:11:10


No, it's more like saying that I have no fundamental problem with peppers; I don't enjoy their spiciness and would prefer not to eat them, but I respect other people's freedom to eat peppers if they choose; **I think it is morally unconscionable to threaten to lock me in prison if I do not eat peppers**. 


Yes but you *must* use fiat currencies to pay taxes. And it's that threat of violence if you refuse that gives the fiat currency value. I have no problem with people using seashells as currency, as long as they don't force me to use them against my will. 


Or maybe they could just leave me alone? I'm aware that there are all sorts of ways around taxation, but that doesn't make taxation ok. That doesn't mean that I haven't been a victim of coercion. I should be free to live my life as I please, and if their currency is so fantastic that I should use it then they can advertise its benefits to me, not threaten to lock me in a cage if I refuse. 


What are you even doing in a cryptocurrency subreddit at this point...? I get it, you love fiat currency manipulation and dream of the government's rock hard cock up your arse, but some of us don't. Leave us alone.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:17:44
But they *are* representing Bitcoin. To them, the Cash chain *is* Bitcoin. Who are you to define Bitcoin for them? If they suggested your advocacy of the Core chain is illegitimate, is that argument any less valid than yours?
It leads to the conclusion that "Bitcoin" is subjective. It's for each free man to decide for himself. Attaching malicious intentions to their actions for no reason other than that you disagree is irrational. And, being in that camp myself, I have seen a lot of their work and found nothing to convince me of these intentions.
They believe Cash is the more legitimate Bitcoin. They have every right to advocate that position.
To really drive the point home, consider this subreddit we're on right now. There is a preferred chain, there are bans and deletions of content that challenge this decree, and I'm sure you can understand how many people view that as deceptive, unethical, deliberately misleading, and manipulative (to use your language). Why are you right and they wrong?

@_date: 2018-02-07 14:07:19
But it's part of the Bitcoin design and philosophy. You can't say that a fundamental concept of Bitcoin is not viable but Bitcoin is viable.
For argument's sake, let's say you're right. Now how do you stop it? How are you going to stop me going to github right now, editing a couple lines of code and running it to fork my own Bitcoin chain? Are you going to prohibit me from talking to my friends about my chain? Throw them in prison if they dare to run it on their machine too?
Do you see what I mean? You can't stop it. It's concerning that you would want to. If Core took Bitcoin down a path that you personally saw fraught with problems and ultimate failure, wouldn't you personally want to be free to fork? Agree or disagree with them, don't you empathise with advocates of the Cash chain who found themselves in this exact situation?
What is "copy cat" about it? It didn't copy Bitcoin, to many *it is Bitcoin*. There are very strong and valid arguments from a philosophical perspective that the Core chain is the fork, in that it has significantly diverged from the ideology and scaling plan of the first 8 years of Bitcoin's existence. Is Core then a copycat? I don't think either are, in the pejorative sense. They are both manifestations of free people supporting the Bitcoin rules that they prefer, just as designed.
And lastly, it's very disingenuous to imply that Cash is a scam created to deceive people. That's certainly not my intention, and I'm sure I know myself better than you. Masking it in concern for gullible people still doesn't make it an argument, just emotive rubbish.

How so? There wasn't even any debate over increasing blocksize for the first ~8 years. Everyone understood the 1mb cap was temporary and that increasing blocksize over time to meet demand was a simple and effective solution. Everyone.
Then Blockstream came on the scene with a financial interest in making 2nd layer solutions attractive (Liquid) and suddenly the whole narrative shifted to this idea that blocksize increases won't work, people should be discouraged from using Bitcoin, a 'fee market' is somehow a success rather than a terrible failure, 2 week transaction delays are fine, etc. Bitcoin was split into multiple competing chains, and many altcoins grabbed huge proportions of market share.

It enables a kind of scaling. A kind of scaling that differs from Nakamoto's plans for scaling, and differs from the entire community's plans for scaling until the relatively recent manipulation of discourse that created the perverse idea that it's not viable in order to push people off Bitcoin on to 2nd layer solutions. 


I agree. It's Bitcoin. 


The market disagrees. And it's disagreeing more strongly by the day as usage and adoption increases among real people really using it.


All of them efforts to scale Bitcoin as planned. All of them attracting Core's ire. 
You can't be mad when so many people try so hard to advocate an overdue capacity increase for Bitcoin, get blocked by authoritarian central planners intent on their own twisted vision for it, and so eventually decide to exercise their right to fork to implement the upgrade anyway. That's Bitcoin working as designed. It's unfortunate that the main codebase and online discussions are controlled by the same small number of people with questionable motives, but fortunately the protocol allows for just such an event. Hard fork is the solution, and that's what we have.

@_date: 2018-02-19 04:21:11


I forced myself through all that statist drivel, but this one here stood head and shoulders above the rest. That's amazing.
As for your misconceptions:
1. It's true, very few who remain in this subreddit have any idea of the underlying principles and ideology upon which Bitcoin is founded and in which it is manifest. Most have been banned or simply become disillusioned by the growing number of voices like yours, and have upgraded to the other unmentionable Bitcoin chain to preserve and continue the work toward economic liberty. The involvement in and perversion of Bitcoin by people like you disgust me (while I respect your freedom to do so). Most of the people who have an underlying interest in Bitcoin's technology and goals, as opposed to new money treating it as a get-rich-quick scheme, have abandoned the legacy Core chain and these censored discussions by now.
2. True, but the advantages are few. If you have no interest in permissionless transactions and economic liberty, and the benefits of being 'fast' and 'cheap' have been eroded by the central planning bureaucracy that you presumably support, then why bother? 
3. Free market capitalism is manifest in Bitcoin. The two are inseparable. 
4. Manipulated by free people acting in their own rational economic self interest, *initiating force against no person or their property*. I have no problem with that. Go for it. I understand the inherent feedback mechanisms in the Bitcoin protocol to feel no need to discourage it. 
5. We can agree on this one!
6. Eh, you're just triggered at this point because someone has a different opinion to you founded on strong moral principles. Acknowledging that your worldview is founded upon the belief that the perpetual threat of violence by a treasonous central authority is benevolent must be challenging, I understand why you're attacking me instead. Given the subreddit we're in, perhaps I should respond in kind by suggesting that you avoid talking about Bitcoin because of your approach, which is either extraordinarily misguided or downright malicious. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:50:47
Fair enough then. Appreciate your consistency. I think an essential feature of Bitcoin's design is that people are free to fork off to rescue it in the event of such a corruption; I don't think any one arbitrary chain has any divine right to claim itself as the one true Bitcoin no matter how much it is perverted. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:11:47
If they change the software to increase the max blocksize, such that new blocks will be rejected by the existing software, isn't that by definition a hard fork? Soon after, there will be a block which will exceed 1mb and the chain will split, permanently.
Am I missing something? How is this not a hard fork? 
@_date: 2018-02-09 07:46:01
Maybe not publicly because all the leftist media wouldn't know how the hell to spin it, but I assure you that's the only thing investors will be interested in. And I hope it's the main thing Musk is interested in too (And, to be clear, "revolutionise the world" is highly compatible with that. See the iPhone for a recent and excellent example.). 
It reminds me of that scene in Atlas Shrugged where Dagny and Hank fuck with reporters by telling them stone-faced how much money they expect to make from the new rail they're laying. In protest, the journalists cry something like "Surely you mean you want to help your fellow man!? You're doing it for the common good, right?", to which the protagonists reply "That's what we said."

Doesn't this emphasise the point...? Nobody needs to force me to buy an iPad, pay for a doctor's appointment, get some PT sessions, help out a family member in a pinch or contribute to a charity doing work I appreciate. 
If you're truly benefiting from it, you don't need to be threatened or forced. If people are actually going to profit from it, they will *want* to hand over their money. The very fact that you think so many people would not fund the government's expenditure voluntarily (and I agree) is a strong indicator that, at least subconsciously, you know this to be true. It's wasted.
I want people to be responsible for their spending. If the roads are breaking down, I don't want the builder to get another contract; I want them incentivised to build good quality, cheap, long-lasting roads. If the children are leaving schools with the astronomical illiteracy rates that I see in some parts of the US, I don't want them getting more money. When people are financially invested and accountable for their decisions and actions, they do much much better. Paying people to screw up is effectively what the government facilitates; otherwise, they wouldn't have to force any of us to pay because we would want to!


Do you mean compared to Australia? Compared to a free and peaceful society, that's still extortion of monstrous proportions. Briefly, before I got into crypto, I was in that bracket... When you're in that position, there's really not any kind of positive word like "deduction" that crosses the mind. It's enough to drive a man to, well, libertarianism and cryptocurrencies.

Forks are a fundamental component of Bitcoin to implement upgrades. If nobody had continued mining the legacy chain, just like with Bitcoin hard forks in the past, then there would not be competing chains and nobody would even have the idea in their head that Bitcoin (Cash) is not Bitcoin. 
When Bitcoin forked to implement 1MB block size, do you consider that a SEPARATE NEW project? Is the modern day Core chain not even Bitcoin, as it diverged years ago from the original protocol rules? Or is a hard fork a valid way to implement protocol fixes and upgrades?


Somebody sounds worried...

Do they not have the right to hard fork off the government chain and rescue Bitcoin from authoritarian tyranny? Isn't that chain then Bitcoin, especially if the whole world gets on board and starts mining that chain in spite of government propaganda and so forth? 
Isn't this kinda the point of Bitcoin? Mining cartel forms? No worries, hard fork. Some monstrous bug is identified that breaks the network? No problem, hard fork. Government conspires to pervert Bitcoin from its intended philosophy and ambitions? No biggie, hard fork. 
It's extraordinarily resilient in this way. The Cash chain was forked in order to rescue Bitcoin from the implementation of Segwit and the central planners who refused to scale the protocol to meet demand (whether you agree or disagree with them is irrelevant). It is viewed by many as the rightful Bitcoin for that reason, and is vying for that position in the free market of ideas by competing for hashrate and adoption. This is *exactly* how Bitcoin is supposed to work. Frankly it's really exciting to see it in action!
Where is the fraud? Are you denying that people have the right to hard fork at any time for any reason, and to promote that chain as Bitcoin? I think that would put *you* at odds with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 10:13:19
Even if the Bitcoin Cash chain was *completely* unsupported, that would require a colossal investment of time, money, and hash power to create a competing chain with more work than the entire Bitcoin network contributed between 2013 and August 1st 2017.

@_date: 2018-02-07 17:12:12


Right, I think we have a bit of agreement here. To shoehorn my view into that framework, the current Bitcoin situation is "messy" - some mine on one chain believing it to be Bitcoin, others mine on a different chain believing it to be Bitcoin - while they compete for consensus. I suppose the network is in limbo, at the moment, while many Core chain supporters would have us believe that it's finished. There is no external authority to make that call, and so the Cash chain supporters will continue advocating their views and contributing their hashrate for some time yet (I know I will) and vice versa.

You don't know what you're talking about... I've urged you already a couple times to learn more about Bitcoin.

People can choose with crypto, though. No central authority can deliberately manipulate the value of your Bitcoin, skimming value off it for their own treasonous purposes. 
I don't like fractional reserve, but I respect others' freedom to work within such a system if they choose to. I don't want to, I shouldn't be forced to, I should not be threatened to. That's morally wrong. Bitcoin gives me the freedom to secure my assets from government financial manipulation and extortion.
If the government didn't force people to use its currency (ie. via taxation) then I would have no fundamental problem with it either!

If I fork Bitcoin right now and start mining my hardfork on a server in my basement, does it affect you if I don't implement replay protection? Am I defrauding you if I mine your transactions on my chain too?
If you're not interested in 2X, ignore it! It's competition. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:54:20

Maybe that's my advantage here, not my problem. I don't care about these rules, I don't care about etiquette, and I find the idea of being careful not to step on anyone's toes to be absurd and incompatible with the goals of Bitcoin. I don't care about any little laws, rules, regulations, traditions, practices, or any other external rubbish that attempts to get in the way of Bitcoin's progress and success.
Fork, copy, break laws, step on toes. Let Bitcoin flourish and fuck anyone who gets in the way, especially any snakes who attempt to do so with politeness.
Disgusting word to see in this context. This is Bitcoin. 


I'm not in the 2x camp anyway and strongly support all those nodes who opt not to switch. Everyone is free to do whatever they like! It would be really great if they supported their preferred chain even more by mining.


I don't view Bitcoin as a fragile get-rich-quick scheme, so again we fundamentally differ in our perspectives. I want and expect people to be trying hard forks, for miners to be putting their hash power wherever they like, etc. It's good! It's not an attack, it's a described feature of Bitcoin. I don't care if the price falls, because I recognise the long term value. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:04:37
Agreed. Ball-Earthers were once laughed at. Fortunately that idea 'forked' off the flat-Earth ideology and won out in the free market of ideas. I wish the same for Bitcoin (Cash). 
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:55:10
They would say the same of the Core chain. 
I agree that it's very confusing for new people, that's why they should research what they're buying before throwing money into technology they don't even begin to understand. I'm sure many have bought coins on the Core chain and been disappointed to find that they've been deceived as well, and that it's not at all the currency with fast, cheap transactions that they were expecting. 
Perhaps allowing open discussion of other chains on a Bitcoin forum like this would be a good start to ensuring people new to Bitcoin are well informed. I hope you would agree that censoring and banning discussions about the Cash chain is highly detrimental to the education of these people, and arguably contributes significantly to their confusion. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:52:40


This is so extraordinarily antithetical to the philosophy of Bitcoin that I just have to reply.
This is the very nature of Bitcoin. Hard forks are the design of Bitcoin. The Cash chain is an example of exactly how Bitcoin is supposed to operate: every man (and his hashrate) is free to do whatever he pleases, including hard forking at any time for any reason and running any version of the software he likes. He can choose the rules that he accepts. 
To suggest someone is committing a moral wrong by performing the free and peaceful action of choosing a Bitcoin philosophy that more closely aligns with his principles, and which he believes to be a superior option, is reprehensible. 
If you truly believe that a fork is any less than a valid and righteous action, open to every person, then the Cash chain is not the enemy of Bitcoin. You are. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 03:38:14
You can't explain what is being stolen or by who? It's the entire basis of your argument... 
@_date: 2017-09-29 09:32:26


Right, so what's the issue? Proposals are tested in Bitcoin by hardforking and competing in the free market for hashpower and such. 


Only by your perverted definition of the concept does it qualify as an 'attack'. They have no obligation to any chain other than their own, just like the 1mb chain has no obligation to implement replay protection. My chain being mined in my basement has no obligation to implement replay protection either.
You could even make the argument that it's not *supposed* to have replay protection. I think the ideal hardfork would be such that all transactions are similarly processed on both, so that both chains are approximately equal when one establishes consensus and the other is abandoned. Otherwise you have this odd situation where people who had traded exclusively on the dead chain are 'out-of-sync' when they are incentivised toward the prevailing chain. (For example, if I buy a mug from you with Bitcoin on the soon-to-be dead chain, then next week when that chain is abandoned you're left with no mug and no Bitcoin, as that transaction never occurred on that chain.)
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:11:56
Read again. My point was that I have seen people who dare to broadcast valid transactions on the Core chain as 'spammers'. I have seen people encouraged not to spend their Bitcoin, instead to do nothing but HODL. 
I think people should use Bitcoin however they like. Bitcoin (Cash) supports this philosophy. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:08:33
Wait, libertarians are the cucks now? Hahaha! How do you figure that?
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:43:47


Yes, and that's a useful analogy here too. The average user doesn't know much about TCP/IP, SSL, etc. To many, even HTML would be something completely foreign to them and they would have never seen Javascript in their life. They just want to log in to Facebook to talk to friends, read some news, share some photos, etc. 
Does that mean that they aren't "prepared" to use the internet so should continue using their newspapers, encyclopedias and postcards? 
They should be welcomed with open arms! Bitcoin is fantastic for the economic activities restricted by governments and banks (darknet markets are a fantastic use case) but I think you won't find many Bitcoin enthusiasts who don't also want it to be useful for everyday vanilla transactions. Surely the goal, if you truly believe in disruption, should be to genuinely compete with fiat currencies in as many contexts as possible. Mainstream adoption is vital, and very valuable. 
\*\*\* Just as a general note, I find it really disappointing that an apparent Bitcoin enthusiast would be advocating continued use of credit cards in a case where Bitcoin can be / is perfectly viable.

It doesn't, because the miners can't force anyone either. *Nobody can*. 
If the increased blocksize is so attractive to the Bitcoin economy that it becomes more profitable for the miners to pursue that chain, then that sounds like a good thing to me. Why would you want to restrict that? 
Why wouldn't you want competent developers encouraged to work on the preferred Bitcoin? Importantly, they can always choose not to and continue to pursue their capped 1mb chain. That's fine too!
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:31:27


Not directly. It will threaten me with escalating force, until I comply. Fines, arrest, imprisonment. I know it sounds a little silly because 99.999% of people comply before this point, but the very real underlying reality of taxation is that they can and *will* kill you (and claim the moral right to do so) if you physically resist at any point in there. Most of the time, they'll "only" drag you out of your home and lock you in a cage for a very long time. 
They won't take everything, sure, but that's morally irrelevant. If a man takes from me a grain of rice or my car, it's still theft. Anyway, the tax man takes sufficiently more than a grain of rice to be a significant financial hit! They only won't take everything because there would be riots in the streets; they take as much as the population and economy can tolerate without triggering rebellion and anarchy. 


Really? So if I call you up and say "Hey, on February 9th 2019, I will be coming to your home and stealing shit to the value of 40% of your earnings between now and then" then that's fine? By what right? Are you committing a moral wrong if you install a security system and put a big padlock on your garage? 


Well this is probably getting a bit beyond the scope of the *morality*, and now into the *utility*. I would just say briefly that if people have children they want educated and other people want to teach, then there will be schools. If people want roads to drive on and people are happy to build roads, then there will be roads. Etc.
The idea that we would all sit around in empty fields picking our noses and twiddling our thumbs without government taking our stuff to squander on ribbon-cutting photo opportunities is mad. 
I would urge you to consider the incentives at play for public spending. They don't fundamentally care about children being educated, they care that they're seen to be educated to the extent that it wins support and votes. They don't fundamentally care about the eocnomy, they care about fudging numbers and contriving short-term economic boosts to make the economy look good and win votes now, even (or *especially*) if it means economic collapse in a decade when the other guys are in office. Governments are notoriously inefficient at spending money, and so they ought to be because I imagine it's very easy to squander other people's money. 


I never said anything about not doing your part. The idea that allowing someone to take your money to splurge on junk that you have no power in deciding is "doing you part" is ridiculous to me. Have you truly considered the catastrophic impact of the welfare state, for example (please look into the trends around single motherhood, divorce, teen pregnancy, childhood poverty, etc)? Do you value your skills so poorly that you don't think you could do more for your people with 40% more time in each day than to have the government take that 40% of productivity and spend it bombing some strangers in a country you've never heard of? Do you rate your financial responsibility so poorly that you don't believe you could help out individuals or charities who you personally know or have personally researched far better than the government can help by unconditionally distributing your tax dollars (or what's left of them after filtering through the beaurocracy) to complete strangers, many of whom are defrauding the system or who have gambling or drug addictions that are only enabled and facilitated by these payments?
(Full disclosure: I'm Australian, so it's the "ATO" here, not "IRS", but otherwise it's all the same. ~40% is the top tax rate here, not even beginning to take into consideration the 10% tax on almost every product or service we buy, inflation, road taxes, property taxes, vice taxes, etc.)
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:38:04


I completely agree. Every participant is free to mine and transact on the chain they choose. For many, that's Bitcoin (Cash), for many others, that's the Core chain. 


You should check out some of the replies to me! I don't really think I am. I don't like Core steering Bitcoin off a cliff while maintaining the name, but I absolutely support their right to do so. They can do whatever they like. It's up to the market to react by hard forking and continuing on a censorship-free chain that adheres to the Bitcoin philosophy and technology. That's what the Cash chain has done, and I hope to see it grow in time as Core adoption and usage continues to stagnate and regress. 


Perhaps take your own advice? You need to at least provide an argument for that. You don't get to call for rationality and then make an outrageous claim like that in the same breath. 


Right. He made the odd claim that a hard fork is fine but calling it 'Bitcoin' is wrong, when a hard fork is a fundamental feature of Bitcoin to allow protocol fixes and upgrades. I am confused how someone could have that view. 
You seemed keen to have a try at defining it but then went off the rails with "BCH is a scam" rhetoric when pressed. So I'm still none the wiser. 
I think there are two ways of looking at it. The Core chain has the hashrate, exchange rate, and most work in its favour. The Cash chain has the Bitcoin philosophy, scaling roadmap, free market economic principles and libertarian community. One is a fork in the technical sense, the other is a fork in the ideological/conceptual sense. I think there are valid arguments for both, and so I'm led to the conclusion that what defines 'Bitcoin' is up to the individual to determine. For you, that's Core; for me, that's Cash. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:32:50
Is that not what they're doing? Didn't you just describe a fork?
@_date: 2017-09-29 06:50:00
But... By that logic, if even a single weak little computer in some dude's shed continued to slowly mine an otherwise-abandoned chain, then that continues to be Bitcoin in perpetuity? Even if the rest of the world hardforked to an 'improved' implementation 147 years ago, the legacy chain remains Bitcoin because this guy in the middle of nowhere forgot about the solar-powered computer in his shed? 
Or, consider this... If I install the old software, before the 1MB hardfork, and mine with that such that I continue and grow this chain, does that then mean that the current Bitcoin is not Bitcoin, but rather the old chain that continues to exist? By your own definition:

Because to them, it is. 
They could well say the same of the Core chain: "Why should it be ok for Bitcoin Core proponents to tell the public that Bitcoin Core is the REAL Bitcoin?"
It's subjective. From a philosophical perspective, I don't think there could be much argument that the Cash chain better represents the concept described in the white paper. The exception being, of course, the current hashrate (and accumulated work) which goes in the Core chain's favour. 


Ironically, everyone would probably agree with you. They would just disagree *which* chain should have the title! I think it's up to each individual to determine for themselves: "1 CPU = 1 vote". 
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:06:24

@_date: 2018-02-07 15:49:17
What do you say to those who would level similar criticism in the opposite direction? That the Core chain community is welcome to diverge with changes like Segwit, maintain a 1MB cap on transaction throughput, and focus instead on off-chain transactions via Lightning, yet using the subreddit and the Core github to push these radical changes from Bitcoin's original concept and philosophy while claiming to be "the real Bitcoin" is a problem? 
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:41:20
I appreciate the effort in your comment but I already understand all of this. 
If you understand all of that, then you won't be at all concerned about a hard fork of this nature. Encourage the miners to fork and run the altered software they prefer, and let the market decide if it's viable or not. 
If the economy (users, nodes, retailers, exchanges, etc) does not support it, then the value of this chain will plummet and it will not be profitable to mine. Miners will soon be incentivised back to the original chain.
If the economy does support it, then its value will be sufficient to support and even incentivise mining of it. Everybody wins. Even those who fundamentally oppose it are still free to continue mining on the original chain!
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:20:11
Is that your only criterion? Let me put a few scenarios to you to test it.
1. A significant bug is identified in the Bitcoin protocol. A hard fork is necessary to correct it. The entire community switches to the corrected hard forked chain and carries on, while a tiny minority of fanatics insist on running the broken protocol on their home CPUs. Which chain is Bitcoin? 
2. Governments conspire to confiscate ASICs around the world and use them to mine Bitcoin. The community rallies and rebels by hardforking to a new algorithm that is ASIC-resistant, rendering their stolen miners useless on the forked chain and maintaining the economic liberty that Bitcoin epitomises. Which chain is Bitcoin? 
3. A mining cartel forms and conspires to introduce radical changes to the Bitcoin protocol, engineered in such a way that previous clients will be naive to the changes: a carefully contrived soft fork. Use your imagination. The majority of the community is deeply concerned about the implications of this fork, and so hard fork in a way that strictly prohibits the changes the cartel was planning to implement. Which chain is Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-09-27 10:15:37
Right, and that's good...
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:42:17
That directly contradicts your previous comment... Now it's majority consensus? I'm reluctant to continue the discussion if you're not going to acknowledge that.
A quick follow up though. What do you mean by "consensus"? Most work? In scenario 2, assume the government ASICs are still pumping out the most hashes and hence have the longest chain (which is not at all unreasonable). Assume, also, as with the current welfare system, that many laymen support their control of Bitcoin (eg. welfare payments distributed in Bitcoin). You have a scenario where most common folk support the government chain of Bitcoin, and the government chain has the most work. Which chain is Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:43:29
Fair enough, appreciate your consistency. Time will tell. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 06:44:06
So you acknowledge that you have made the conscious decision not to make any effort to understand their perspective. 
Fair enough, that's your right. Just be honest about that then, don't slander them if you admit that you have no idea what you're talking about. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 06:37:22
So it must have unanimous support to be 'Bitcoin'? Nothing is Bitcoin then.
Ironically, it seems to me that one of the main fears about the 2X fork I've seen in my discussions here is that *it is popular*. I keep bringing up the point that if I hardforked and mined my chain on a crappy server in my basement, nobody would care! Yet, because 2X has such strong consensus, especially among miners, some people have their knickers in a twist...
Maybe the general consensus is against 2X and it will quickly die. That's fine, let it happen. Or maybe a lot more people support it than you realise, and it thrives. That's fine too. It's not an attack, and nobody has any right to stop them or slander them as such (by all means argue against their ideas, but labeling them as attackers for exercising their right to a fundamental feature of Bitcoin is outrageously disingenuous). 
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:40:01
The market crashed and nobody is using it, that's what happened. Surely you're not denying that *at some point* the 1MB cap is a hard artificial limit on transaction capacity. I would argue that point arrived a while ago, you seem to think a lot of the economic activity is 'spam' so it hasn't arrived yet, but it is a mathematical inevitability that it *will* be a barrier at some point if usage continues to increase, right? 


"Not using Bitcoin reduces Bitcoin transactions!" Obviously... Whether or not that's a good thing is up to the individual to decide, I suppose.
@_date: 2017-09-30 09:42:12
Or... maybe... just maybe... different people have different ideas to you as to how Bitcoin can scale.
@_date: 2017-09-28 02:27:59


You don't own the miners. They're not your slaves. They can mine whatever they like. Giving them another option and having them exercise free will is not an attack. The implications of that view are revolting and expose an insecurity. 


If it's not an upgrade, who cares? Let it die. If it is superior, however, then it kinda is Bitcoin. There is nobody with the divine right to identify what is and what isn't Bitcoin. The criteria for doing so would be the work in the chain and its commitment to the white paper, certainly not which particular people write the code. 
They're not being fired from their project, either. Nothing will happen to them. They are free to continue working on it as if nothing happened, if they choose. 


This is a difference of opinion, that's all. By the same logic, they could argue that your insistence that Bitcoin has not forked to a new chain is an attack on Bitcoin. I don't care about personalities, mainstream media nonsense, etc.


So your main concern about 2x is that it's popular and has a lot of support? That a lot of people like it and want to throw significant capital and resources behind it? 
So people are free to hard fork as long as there's never any actual chance that it will achieve anything..? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:43:22


You must realise this is subjective. To many, the Core chain is *not* the "real" Bitcoin. It differs so fundamentally in its philosophy and roadmap that I'm sure you can understand how so many might share this view. 
So who defines Bitcoin? It's a tough question. Is it hashrate/work? Is it exchange rate? Is it authenticity? I think it's up the individual.

We're probably starting to go in circles so I'll make this my last comment.


It doesn't destroy it though. Everyone is free to carry on mining the original chain. If there is a 'better' Bitcoin available to the miners, why wouldn't they mine it?; why shouldn't they mine it?; why shouldn't they be able to mine it?; why wouldn't you want people to be freely able to fork that 'better' Bitcoin? 
I'm not understanding why any of this is negative. If it's worse, then it won't be worth anything and it will remain more profitable for miners to continue with the original chain. If it's better, then that's great. 


Your above comment conceded that the same team remains fully in control of their project, so this isn't true. I know you're not trying to be disingenuous but I must point out that the language you use here is very loaded and misleading. They are forking the project, that's the beauty of open source. 


Great! If another version is better, I would love all resources to be shifted towards it. Of course I want people to freely pursue whatever they like, but being disappointed that people will no longer continue to work on an unwanted legacy chain is insane to me. It's *good* that worse implementations are abandoned (if 2X turns out to be worse, then I will also celebrate the return of resources and capital to the original). 
@_date: 2017-09-23 04:58:12
It may shock you to learn that many people actually use Bitcoin, it's not just a get rich quick scheme. If it's valuable, it's because it's useful, so you're probably going to want that one. You have a bizarre way of looking at things.

Ohhh this is why you want replay protection so badly! I get it now. You want it to be just valuable enough that you can dump it for easy $, but you're terrified of it being sufficiently valuable to actually succeed.
Bitcoin is more than just a get-rich-quick scheme for me, I don't particularly care which chain prevails, as long as Bitcoin as a whole is successful. I support 2X, just as I support all hard forks. I don't particularly like 2X though.

They're free to pursue their economic interests the same as any other Bitcoiner. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:07:27
The market considers the likelihood that they are inaccessible and has factored that in. Of course if something happens to make the market more certain one way or another, that will shift the valuation. 
If Nakamoto's coins moved, even slightly, for example, then it would confirm that those coins are still in play and the market would adapt to reflect this increased supply (not really 'increased' though, more 'restored'). If all those coins were destroyed, then of course you would expect the price to increase to reflect the decreased supply (putting aside the panic and hysteria that would ensue if Nakamoto did so). If they all started moving to exchanges, actively involved in trading, then you would definitely expect the price to decrease proportionally. Supply and demand. 
It's not inflation but I get your meaning.

We're probably going around in circles a bit now so I just want to focus in a couple points:


According to who? Many would be of the opinion that the chain with the most work - ie. typically that with &gt;50% of the hashpower - *is* Bitcoin for that very reason.

Why though? They have no obligation to include replay protection. That might be inconvenient to you if you want both chains to co-exist in some odd mutually-compatible symphony, but that's not their problem. 
If I fork Bitcoin right now and start mining my hardfork on a server in my basement, do I have an obligation to implement replay protection? Shouldn't I be able to mine the available transactions? Am I attacking you if I mine your transactions on my chain?
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:49:46
Everyone has the power to change the protocol. You can do it right now, if you choose.
And miners can choose to run whatever software they like. You can freely mine right now and contribute your hashpower to whichever implementation of Bitcoin you prefer. 
If governments wanted to fork Bitcoin and miners wanted to work on that fork, then they would all freely be able to. You have no right or power to stop them. If that's where the money is, and if we assume that miners (and all other Bitcoiners) act in their economic self-interest, then ironically that government fork will be the 'best' one. 
Stop worrying about what others are doing. Stop trying to control or manipulate them. Hard forks are a feature, not a fragility. Let everyone's ideas and capital compete in the free market, as per the principles of Bitcoin itself, and have confidence that that is the best and *only* way to fulfill the vision of Bitcoin itself. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 06:52:54
So what? What's the magic number of value whereby a harmless hardfork becomes a fraudulent attack? 
Are you saying that people are free to hardfork only as long as it is unpopular, obscure, worthless, etc? That is, hardforks are fine, only as long as they don't have any genuine chance of success?

Why not compete the way Bitcoin was intended to do so: Rather than paying your attorney a fortune, invest some of your Bitcoin profits into a few mining ASICs and commit your hashpower to the chain that best represents your interests.
You don't have to make this a political thing at all. Put your money (ie. your hashpower) where your mouth is. That's all they're doing...
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:10:59


I don't understand the relevance of any of this until you answer my other question there: Who is stealing what?


Bitcoin Cash is still competing. There's no clear consensus yet. And, of course, there's always the chance that both chains will continue on in perpetuity as 'separate' cryptos.
I don't believe it has ever had the most work though, even if it has temporarily had the most hash power.


Ironically, full nodes are designed to do exactly this! Whenever multiple miners solve a block at approximately the same time, the network may experience a fork event; your full node may be up to date yet out of sync with another node running the exact same rules. For all intents and purposes, you are momentarily operating on separate currencies, with your wallets switching without you even knowing about it.
As more blocks are mined and one chain is clearly established as the 'longest', all nodes on the other chain switch over to the chain with the most work (without you knowing about it).


There's some very loaded language here without any explanation or argument for what this supposed flaw is.
You openly broadcast a transaction on the network. Someone runs software that mines that into a chain you don't even care about. And that's attacking a flaw? How?
I really want you to specifically identify the attack/exploit/flaw here. Do they not have the right to receive and relay transactions? Do they not have the right to hard fork the Bitcoin software? Do they not have the right to run that software? Do they not have the right to mine on their hard fork?
And, if you don't care for this chain and don't support it at all, why do you give a toss what these people do on it? It's none of your business, surely?

@_date: 2017-09-16 17:18:14
Does it matter if people in 3rd world countries can't/won't run a node? Their transaction will still be propagated by your node on the other side of the world, right? 
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:18:41


But surely it's impossible to soft fork to a higher max block size. Existing software will reject larger blocks on that basis, and I can't imagine any clever code trickery to increase the size in such a way that 1mb nodes still accept it...
From [here]( "A soft fork ... is any change that's backward compatible." Blocksize increase is *not* backward compatible, it's not possible to be a soft fork.


That's a hard fork. The miners running 2X are happy with &gt;1mb blocks, while the miners committed to 1mb are not and instead continue to mine 1mb blocks on the 'original' chain. 
I certainly accept that replay protection is an issue, but this is true of all hard forks. It's nothing unique to 2X, it's just a reality of the nature of hard forks and I think it's disingenuous to label it an attack or even negligent. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:58:54


Not if there are more of them. All else being equal, 8MB Cash blocks already allow for 1/8th the individual transaction fee for equal block reward with the Core chain. That is, if there are 8 times as many transactions then each one can pay 1/8th the fee and miners receive the same total. There is the negligible cost of bandwidth and storage increases too, to be fair.
If adoption doesn't continue increasing, then mining will have to adjust down in response. That's true. That's why adoption is so important, that's why we want people to use their Bitcoin as intended, for it to be viable not just for shifting $100k around but also for buying a coffee. If it fails, it fails. I'm more comfortable with that reality than I am with deliberately perverting the course of Bitcoin into a crippled insult to its potential. As Satoshi said, in 20 years there will either be a LOT of transactions or none. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 06:30:54
Are people free to hard fork Bitcoin at any time for any reason? Or is a hard fork an attack on 'Bitcoin' and/or its users?

@_date: 2017-09-16 17:36:22


What is the detriment? 
The more nodes the merrier, but it seems to me that as long as there is a single node on Earth listening to my transaction then it's fine. A miner, in particular, has every reason to be especially interested in paying attention to my transaction because of the financial incentive to acquire the included fee. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:32:46
I disagree. To say that your preferred chain is 'Bitcoin', and that you have the divine right to distinguish this one true chain as such, no matter how much others or even the entire remainder of the network disagrees, is more ridiculous. 
By your logic, you could implement the most obscure soft forked rubbish to drive away 99% of the users (and hashrate) onto a separate hard-forked chain that perfectly represents the vision of the whitepaper, and yet that original, perverted, short, insecure chain would still be 'Bitcoin'... You're free to believe that, I suppose, that's the beauty of Bitcoin; you can still commit to mining that chain and refusing to acknowledge payments on any other. But for others, the chain with the most work, users, hashrate, and most authentic commitment to the vision of the whitepaper is 'Bitcoin', and they're free to think that too, maaaan, and their claim is a lot stronger than yours if not only for the fact that their chain is longer (more work).

@_date: 2018-02-07 16:37:44


Through free market principles, as Bitcoin is founded upon. If you want a miner to include your transaction, include a fee sufficient to incentivise them.
I believe that if people are happy to pay miners to include transactions, and miners are happy to include those transactions, then no central planner should intervene in that peaceful activity and deny them the right to do so. 
An artificial cap which limits their ability to freely trade, and which destroys the utility of Bitcoin - fast, cheap, permissionless transactions - is harmful to the value and adoption of Bitcoin. Certainly there will be no "champaign" corked if fees ever hit the outrageous numbers they have recently on the Core chain (yes, even the $5 ones). 
It's for the free market to determine. Nothing good ever came from trying to centrally plan an economy.

Adoption and usage is increasing every day. People are *encouraged* to use the Cash chain, rather than condemned as spammers or warned that speculative hodling is the only socially acceptable use case. 
Time will tell.
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:39:56


Absolutely, that's the plan! The blocksize was introduced as a measure against spam as an attack vector, not to block legitimate economic activity. If miners are happy to increase block size, then block size will be increased. And I will be enjoying a glass of champaign the day blocks are increased from 8MB because it's being used to facilitate so many fast and cheap transactions. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 00:40:40
So if consensus supports 2X, then isn't that 'Bitcoin'? 
How do you propose we test consensus if any attempted alternatives are shot down as "attacks"?
@_date: 2017-09-28 02:37:09


No it's not. It's allowing people to freely pursue their economic interests, voluntarily trading as they please.
Usually that means many options for consumers, but not always. Certainly having multiple options is not a criteria for a free market, but people being able to freely offer multiple options if they are willing and able is.
A virtue of free markets is that inferior options are ruthlessly killed off by superior products and services. It's fantastic that the horse-drawn carriage industry was annihilated by the automobile.
You are still free to buy a horse and carriage and get around in that, if you like. It will be odd and inconvenient, but you're free to. In the same way, you will be free to mine on the lesser chain if you choose (whether that's 1mb or 2x). It will be odd and inconvenient, but I strongly support your right to not be restricted in doing so. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 07:45:11
Even if it were true, what benefit is there in screwing over your own people and economy to appease the hysterical lefties by reducing your carbon emissions by a few %? That industry will just move overseas to developing countries where their conditions don't allow for even the consciousness of climate change, let alone any attempt to reduce their effect on the environment, so you're really just outsourcing your carbon footprint to foreign countries where the effects will be even worse. As well as losing jobs, making your domestic industry noncompetitive, crippling innovation with regulations and social demonisation, etc...
Here in Australia we recently had some bureaucratic mess whereby electricity providers, crippled by renewable targets and associated regulations, will *pay people not to use electricity*. If this was in some fiction about a socialist dystopia I would barely believe it. Providers paying you not to use their services!? Madness. And a big political issue is the concern over the average household being hammered with exponentially increasing power bills.

You're not stealing anything... I'm signing that transaction and sending it out there to be mined. There could be a thousand Bitcoin hardforks running right now around the world that process that transaction on their respective chains. That does not mean you're committing theft a thousand times over! When I sign that transaction, I do so with the understanding that I am authorising the transfer of coins on *all* of those chains, including 1X and 2X and every other one too (or, more likely, I don't actually give a toss about the transaction on any chain other than the one I choose). 
Consider this: If, before you send me a payment, I quickly hardfork to create a new chain, then mine this transaction on my forked chain (as well as the main chain), have I just committed theft? If a 3rd party does this on a miner in his basement, without the knowledge of either of us, have I stolen anything from you? 


But you're not arguing this. You're arguing that they're doing *wrong* by not implementing replay protection. Maybe it's useful to include it, but they're not committing a wrong of any kind by not doing so. It's a perfectly peaceful, voluntary act. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:24:34
The hard fork has every right to compete in the free market to be the main implementation of Bitcoin, with the others being abandoned. Ideally, that's the point of a hard fork, not to create all these bastardised off chains that go on perpetually side-by-side. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 01:58:11
But that's the point of a hard fork... It's not an "attack", it's a way to test an idea in the Bitcoin free market.
Who cares if it has no replay protection? If it ends up being the main chain then let the 1mb chain die; if 1mb ends up being the main chain then let 2x die. You can certainly argue that it's messy and confusing, but I'll be damned if I'll hear that anyone is attacking Bitcoin by trying in good faith to upgrade it in the expected manner, no matter how right or wrong they are. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:39:28


You might think that, I happen to think that they deliberately did so because a hard fork was intended to compete and swiftly resolve with one chain prevailing and the other being entirely abandoned. I don't believe that having multiple incompatible chains processing incompatible transactions in perpetuity is healthy or valuable for the success of Bitcoin. 


Or maybe I was refusing to even engage with the notion that 2X is an 'altcoin'...


And what about your absurd proposal that any action within the Bitcoin economy is invalid/hostile without a Core developer there to supervise and sign off on it?


Fine, let it die then. Don't worry about it. It will soon be unprofitable for miners and they'll be incentivised back to the 1X chain. They have every right to offer the option and allow the market to settle on consensus, not to have do-good central planners dictating what software is and isn't allowed to be run by free individuals. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:45:35
Forking is a Bitcoin term, too. A fork is a split in the blockchain, a moment in which multiple implementations can compete in the free market for hashrate, utility, adoption, and acceptance. A Bitcoin fork *is* the original project, these competing chains are an essential design component of Bitcoin and its evolution. 
If you hard fork, you have every right to claim it as Bitcoin. It *is*. Others are free to join your chain or dismiss it as they see fit. 
To many, the Cash chain *is* Bitcoin. To many others, it is not. They're both right. The chains are competing to prove to the market that they are the best implementation of Bitcoin and to garner as much support as possible. As someone who has been involved with Bitcoin for a while now, having become depressed and disilluisoned with the failure of the Core chain to remain authentic to the vision for Bitcoin and scale as necessary, the Cash chain has been a ray of light to reinvigorate my interest and optimism for Bitcoin. To me, the Cash chain *is* Bitcoin. I probably have as much resistance to people calling the Core chain "Bitcoin" as you do the other way, but I support your right to believe it is. They're currently competing, and I desperately hope that the Cash chain can continue to win support and adoption as it grows and eventually unseats Core, else I'll probably cash out and be done with it. To me, Cash has more claim as the "original" than Core does. 
Bitcoin will have failed, in my view, if Core wins out. That's why forks are important. They allow free people to implement changes to rescue the project from the jaws of defeat, to maintain the idea of Bitcoin as a fast, cheap, permissionless economy for any person to join and participate in.

I can't see anything that contradicts my use of the term. The very first sentence seems about right: "an appeal to authority ... is a form of defeasible argument in which a claimed authority's support is used as evidence for an argument's conclusion". 


Read the Wiki link you provided (see "Appeals to authorities" under "Forms"). Even if that person is an authority on the matter, it doesn't mean their word is gospel. "Authorities must prove their contentions like everybody else."


You're railing on me really hard here for someone who so clearly reveals his own misunderstanding of the term you insist I educate myself on... 


Fair. Still, telling him it's the way it is because someone else said so isn't going to convince him otherwise. 


I'm saying it doesn't constitute an argument. It's not an explanation. It may well be 100% correct, but nobody genuinely engaged in that conversation learns anything at all. I personally don't understand why people feel such a strong need to have every man and his dog running a node, so it does me no favours to just read people saying "Adam Back says it's good so it's good".

Bitcoin forked recently, so anyone with Bitcoin before August 1st suddenly had that same amount of Bitcoin on two separate chains afterwards (the other that forked is known as Bitcoin Cash).
As the saying goes though, if you don't exclusively hold your private key (eg. if they're in an exchange like Coinbase), you don't really own any Bitcoin. Coinbase was under no legal obligation to credit users with an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash for their Bitcoin holdings, and wouldn't commit to doing so, so users rushed to withdraw Bitcoin from Coinbase before August 1st so that they would then control the private key, thus ensuring access to their Bitcoin *and* the new Bitcoin Cash after the fork. Even those with no interest in the fork had a significant incentive to do so: these numbers could be way off but as a rough guide, Bitcoin Cash was trading around 500-600 USD, so many considered it "free" money to the value of about 1/6th of their Bitcoin.
Presumably, Coinbase has recently decided to now retrospectively credit this Bitcoin Cash to Bitcoin holders. Many predict that a lot of this will be traded for Bitcoin, hence increasing Bitcoin price.

I think this is the only meat on that bone so I'll ignore the hysteria and non-arguments and just respond to this. 
Imagine this scenario:
Governments conspire to confiscate ASICs around the world and use them to mine Bitcoin. The crypto community rallies and rebels by hardforking to a new algorithm that is ASIC-resistant, rendering their stolen miners useless on the forked chain and maintaining the economic liberty that Bitcoin epitomises. Governments manipulate the media to positively report on their Bitcoin mining, and some Bitcoin is distributed to welfare recipients, such that public perception among the low-information populace is very positive. The scenario is such that the chain with the most work is completely controlled by state actors through illegitimate force, and the majority of the population implicitly or explicitly supports this chain. It has "consensus" in a technical and colloquial sense, despite being completely contrary to the Bitcoin ideology and goals. 
Which chain is Bitcoin: the rebels' minor chain, or the state chain?

I have to believe this is some kind of parody or troll. You really just used that quote in this context!? 
That was from a comment where Nakamoto pointed out how ridiculous it is in the long term for everyone to be running nodes: 


Within that comment, and the part your quote specifically refers to, he links to another of his posts about 0-conf allowing fairly-reliable transactions within 10 seconds. To buy a snack from a vending machine.
In summary, that's 3 key points direct from Satoshi which fundamentally differ from the current Core concept of Bitcoin: Usage is more important than running full nodes, which is unrealistic for every user in a large scale Bitcoin network; 0-conf is important for fast and reliable transactions; and Bitcoin ought to be useful for buying a snack (ie. $20+ fees are *not* to be celebrated).

That's fine, I don't have anything fundamentally against fractional reserve or inflation. I just don't personally want to use it, and I suspect most sensible people would not voluntarily choose to use a currency that facilitates the perpetual theft of their value by the central authority which controls it. 
I don't care if Walmart starts handing out vouchers as currency, I don't care if they operate on a fractional reserve. I don't care if they print these things off like crazy. I don't care if they devalue them. Because people can freely choose not to use the store! I can shop elsewhere.

I do think it's important to distinguish between authoritarian government intervention and civil cases which would be perfectly reasonable in a free society where the government currently performs the role as arbiter. 
For example, it's wrong to leverage government force to prevent anyone exercising their right to hard fork and run whatever software they prefer. 
I do not agree, however, that using Bitcoin in any sense means you forfeit all rights not to be defrauded. I saw someone else suggest that if an exchange spontaneously decides to keep all your assets held with them then you're shit out of luck, which is wrong, and they ought to be sued to recover that property. Just as if I buy a bike with Bitcoin but the seller takes my satoshis and rides away while giving me the finger then he has committed a wrong against me and I'm right to seek compensation. 
What this boils down to then, as I see it, is the particular exchange's policy regarding hard forks. This ought to be a prominent part of the user agreement, and it may even be that they have no set action to take. Maybe their policy is to always follow the chain with the most work, or to always stick to the current chain, etc. Their policy may even be something along the lines of publicly announcing and emailing all users x days in advance of their intent to 'switch' chain, so that users have time to withdraw if they choose. Whatever the policy, users should be aware and in agreement, and then it removes all confusion in times like this. Absolutely, if the exchange then does anything that contradicts this policy, users are entitled to and should sue for damages.

Spitting on the foundations and vision of Bitcoin to impose your antithetical authoritarianism upon it is a problem for me. Forking is always an option for any person dissatisfied with the status quo or eager to share and test an improvement with the community. They have as much right to regard that chain as Bitcoin as any other chain. The idea that any central planner has the divine right to arbitrarily choose a chain that is The One True Bitcoin™ is repugnant to the very idea of Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin upgraded to larger blocks and to protect the chain of signatures. Many people like that upgrade, many don't. It's not for you or I to dictate what is Bitcoin to them, nor to tell them they don't even have the right to define Bitcoin on their own terms. The very point of a fork is to convince others of its superiority; that is not a 'problem' for Bitcoin, it is Bitcoin working as designed.

I could not possibly care less. I absolutely understand that it would suck to have your work copied without credit (and it seems that's not even the case here) but as a user I really can't emphasise enough how few shits I give. 
I wouldn't want people reinventing the wheel. Compete to create the best Bitcoin on your respective forks and win people over in the free market of ideas; if some licences are stretched here and there or people glance at others' homework to get some pointers then it seems a beneficial thing for the Bitcoin project as a whole.
My amateur analysis is that they did the bare minimum so leave them be. If you weren't threatened by them, you wouldn't bother with this. If you didn't have a political issue with them (eg. if this was a friendly fork with a similar vision that Core supported) then I'm certain you wouldn't hassle them over this.

Even if this was the deal, what do you say about the government changing the terms every year without any consultation with me? I don't agree to the updated terms. They can decide to double my taxes tomorrow and I'm powerless to do anything about it. They'll lock me in a cage if I don't comply. Can I decide to halve my taxes tomorrow and lock bureaucrats in a cage if they don't comply?

That's only one issue with fiat currencies. Another I was talking about (though didn't explicitly identify, sorry) was *inflation*, which you are a perpetual victim of for as long as you possess any fiat currency subjected to it. 
And you don't get to opt out. The government forces you to use their currency (via taxation) and then deliberately skims value from that currency you own via inflation. It's outrageous. Stuff that cash under your mattress for 10 years and watch its value decrease every minute of every day; it will be worth significantly less when you retrieve it later as a result of deliberate devaluation.
They can inflate the currency if they like, but they have no right to force people to use it. I suspect most people would have no voluntary interest in using a currency which enables a central authority to slowly steal their value over time. 
The perverse outcome of this is that everybody crams their money into banks, stocks, real estate and other investments they may not even fully understand in an attempt to offset the devaluation of their money. I don't think it's unreasonable to suggest that this contributes to many bubbles in these economies. Many people *don't want to* invest in this shit. I don't!

Because when you can be paid in Bitcoin, buy your groceries with Bitcoin, pay your bills with Bitcoin, and give your kid Bitcoin to buy lunch at school, then you won't give a toss what the exchange rate is to your local hyperinflated fiat currency.
For the same reason that you don't desperately hoard your US Dollars because they're "worth more" every day compared to Zimbabwe Dollars.

What about it is an attack? Is it not open source software? Are people not free to make whatever changes they like? Are others not free to join and develop, trade, and mine with that version if they prefer it? Isn't that *good*? Isn't that one of the fundamental features of Bitcoin, that it can hard fork and evolve? 
Perhaps the strongest case I can make against this being an attack is that if you're not interested in it then *you can just ignore it*. (Though it would be fair to point out here that those not relying on their own full node would be made to put some trust in other parties if they want to ensure they participate on the chain of their choice.) Perhaps the best thing about this, for small blockers, is that it will emphasise the importance of full nodes!
Offering users another choice is not an attack. Winning over users with superior implementations is not an attack. Incentivising miners with a preferable chain is not an attack.

Why is that controversial? The average Joe who might want to buy a coffee with Bitcoin is more likely to want to pay quickly, and with a fee that doesn't double his coffee cost, without caring too significantly about authoritarian censorship in his day to day life. The more mainstream Bitcoin becomes, the further it's naturally going to shift away from predominantly libertarian cypherpunks to normies. 
That's certainly not to say censorship resistance isn't a key factor which should obviously always be upheld as a pillar of the currency. It's just that most people probably won't care about it because they don't need to; speed and fees are more important.

Do all forks have to be backwards compatible? The 1MB limit was introduced of course via hard fork. Now, fortunately for your argument there happen to be no blocks exceeding 1MB mined before that was implemented, but it's still a rule change that is incompatible with pre-1MB clients. Is the current Core chain even Bitcoin, by your definition? 


It absolutely is not. I'm not sure why you'd even toss that in there, it doesn't do your credibility much good. 


Do you realise that many would say literally the exact same thing about the current state of the Core chain? Many very intelligent, reasonable, enthusiastic Bitcoin advocates who have been in the scene a long time. Not gullible newbies. 


I'm not against 2nd layer solutions themselves, but I am against discarding the scaling plan for Bitcoin and intentionally crippling transaction capacity in order to create a market for these solutions. I have no issue with people building whatever they want on top of Bitcoin, they're free to do as they please, but I'm naturally very suspicious of any apparent attempt to derail Bitcoin's progression in favour of them. Do as you wish, but leave Bitcoin alone.

That depends on the exchange's policy regarding hard forks. It has nothing to do with the hard fork itself, which is always a free and peaceful option for any person or group wanting to alter the software for any reason. 
Allow me to copy/paste from a couple of my recent comments:




It seems to me that you believe exchanges should stick with the same chain regardless of any other factors including hashrate, work, consensus, value, etc. ie. 'Core' is Bitcoin.
For exchanges without a clear policy on hard forks then, I wonder what you think should happen. Consider this: **If 2X prevails and 1X was effectively abandoned (with ~0 hashrate and ~0 value), is the exchange still obliged to follow that chain, with users having no claim to the coins on the 2X fork?** 
On that very last point, I hope you see and agree that this would cause an uproar, and would likely have the exchange (reasonably) sued for the very action which you are now advocating. 
I appreciate that you're passionate about 1X but the reality is that 2X may win out, and in that scenario exchange users are probably going to want 2X coins (technically, they will be *entitled* to whatever they agreed to with respect to the exchange's hard fork policy). There may even be an ugly situation where both exist simultaneously for some time, perhaps even forever, and exchange users will be demanding both (as with Bitcoin Cash). 
It's not inherently black-and-white; the only way to make it so is for exchanges to have their approach clearly specified for users in their agreement (or intentions made public well in advance of any action). If they abide by this reasonable user agreement, they should not be sued no matter how much you disagree with them, as users have understood and consented to the exchange's policy regarding hard forks. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:19:33


True, the longer it drags on, the further they are likely to diverge. Let's hope for a very quick resolution.
@_date: 2017-10-02 03:31:17
Well I'm sure we can agree that exchanges without a clear policy on hard forks create a lot of confusion and uncertainty, as well as incentivising their users to withdraw their assets. I'm glad you chose to do that in this case.


That's just it though, I'm not sure that there's a precedent for this in the non-crypto world. Cryptocurrency hard forks are a new and unique issue, which is why it's so important for this to be a significant and very clear aspect of an exchange's policy, otherwise a lot of people are going to disagree about what should happen and why.
Consider these:


Subjective. How much value (what's the magic number where an exchange is suddenly obligated to provide the infrastructure to access a forked coin)? Value according to whom? Isn't it unreasonable for external parties to create an expensive obligation for an exchange to develop this functionality?


What if that protocol is completely abandoned now and everyone has switched to the new one? Many users would be demanding that one, instead, while there's a solid argument for the exchange having no obligation to provide it. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 03:58:43
I agree, but I'm certain many others won't see it that way. It would definitely be an interesting legal case, which would probably end up having to discuss what *is* Bitcoin (is it the chain with the most work, or is it a particular chain) and what exactly you are entitled to when you hold BTC in an exchange (is it Bitcoin as per the previous definition, or is it that particular chain you bought into).
Keep in mind that it was only very recently that we saw exchanges threatened with legal action to force them to credit users with Bitcoin Cash!
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:58:24


Nope, it's how Bitcoin is designed. You are free to hardfork Bitcoin right now and mine your own fork without replay protection. Anyone is free to do so. 


I don't even know what this means in this context...


Nope. There are no official developers. Everyone is free to code whatever they like. Don't like the software? Don't run it!
Core is free to continue developing their version as well. They have no obligation to develop any particular version, and the miners have no obligation to mine any particular version.
Everyone is free. Embrace it because it's wonderful, not hostile and scary.

When blocks are full, people are tacking fees of $100+ and routinely $20+ to try to cram their transactions into tiny blocks, and there's a backlog in the hundreds of thousands of transactions, you don't think that constitutes "necessary"? That was the very real situation recently, until enough people gave up trying to use Bitcoin for now. Do you think preventing so many people from using Bitcoin is what Satoshi had in mind? 
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:07:27
The market considers the likelihood that they are inaccessible and has factored that in. Of course if something happens to make the market more certain one way or another, that will shift the valuation. 
If Nakamoto's coins moved, even slightly, for example, then it would confirm that those coins are still in play and the market would adapt to reflect this increased supply (not really 'increased' though, more 'restored'). If all those coins were destroyed, then of course you would expect the price to increase to reflect the decreased supply (putting aside the panic and hysteria that would ensue if Nakamoto did so). If they all started moving to exchanges, actively involved in trading, then you would definitely expect the price to decrease proportionally. Supply and demand. 
It's not inflation but I get your meaning.

I don't care about your open source rubbish. I care about Bitcoin. If your cute little open source rules are in its way then I hope it steamrolls them. I not only condone but encourage Bitcoiners to crush anyone attempting to exploit open source development culture as an excuse to hijack or derail the development and adoption of Bitcoin itself. If you try to use those 'rules' to control Bitcoin's progression (or lack thereof) then I would encourage people to openly violate them. 


Nobody owns the Bitcoin project. It belongs to nobody. Who are you suggesting owns it? Those in control of the Core repository on github? Why? How? By what metric? Who gives a shit about that? 
Anyone can fork that project at any time and their software has as much right and legitimacy to exist as the Core implementation itself. It's a free system. Do whatever the hell you like. 


Which is completely different. I don't care what they call the client, and that seems to be what you're transfixed on here. I don't think anyone else even copies the 'Core' name for their client so I don't know why this would be a problem (eg. 'Bitcoin ABC' client for the Cash chain).
I'm talking about the *chain*. The network. Bitcoin.


In Bitcoin, it's called a competing chain. It has every right to exist, to rally support, to garner adoption and usage, and to be considered Bitcoin itself. If your chain is so fragile as to be threatened by a competing chain, then it's *good* that that chain exists. That's a good thing. The best idea should (and will) win, not the one with the most authoritarian control.

@_date: 2017-10-01 16:20:46
I don't get how anyone is losing anything. 
If you don't care about the 2X fork, just do your business on the 1X fork as per usual. Go on with your life as if 2X doesn't even exist. 
Fortunately for you, if 2X prevails (and 1X is abandoned) then all of those transactions will be valid on the 2X chain and will hopefully have been included. You can make a clean switch to the exact same state on the other chain! (Of course it's unlikely to be *exact*, but I think the closer it can be the better.)
If you support 2X then it's largely the same, with the exception that if it becomes more and more popular then the 1X chain may be unable to keep up with the transactions (requiring &gt;1mb blocks) and they will become out of sync. In this scenario, the 2X chain will almost certainly quickly reach consensus and the 1X chain will die off so you don't really risk losing anything. Just carry on using the 2X as if 1X doesn't exist. 
Regardless of what you support or what actually happens, nobody has any obligation to include replay protection in their hard fork (it could even be argued that replay protection is a *bad* thing). It's a free and open protocol. I can hard fork right now with my own altered version of Bitcoin, run it on a miner in my basement, and I'm not committing a moral wrong against anybody by listening to transactions and including them in blocks in my blockchain. 
They have every right to do what they're doing. They can't access your Bitcoins, they can't steal anything, and they're not defrauding anyone by offering an alternate implementation of Bitcoin. It doesn't matter how much you dislike or disagree with them, they're free to do it.
@_date: 2017-09-27 04:23:57
They can't force anyone to do anything. Nobody can. The miners are not your slaves, they are free to mine whatever they choose.
It sounds more like you want to force others to do what you want, and you're just frustrated that you're powerless to do so with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:21:49
You're making me read a lot here yet I'm still not finding answers.
My understanding is that 2x supporters would agree with almost everything in your comment except for this: "There have been attempts to mislead people into believing ... the Segwit2x proposal is a necessary update to existing software—it is not". They believe that it *is* a beneficial/necessary update.
The only vaguely relevant point to my question was the second-to-last, with this example:


To which I would respond that the other chain does not have any obligation to care! If you strongly support Core's 1mb Bitcoin, then consider why you care what happens on some other invalid chain that happens to be listening to your transaction. 
If I go and hard fork Bitcoin now with some minor incompatible code change and start mining it with my personal computer, do you care? Am I attacking you? Am I being negligent or in any way jeopardising your property if I don't implement some kind of replay protection? What harm does it do you if my computer includes your transaction in a block on a chain that you don't care about? 
As succinctly as possible, could you explain how a hard fork constitutes an attack?
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:47:37
Agreed, that would be even better. 
If there is ever any disagreement, however, a hardfork is always an option to find a resolution. Talk is cheap, but hard forks make people put their money where their mouth is.

The intention is to get them set up, demonstrate sending and receiving btc. It doesn't matter if they have no interest, at least they know about it now and can form their own opinion. 
Your argument would definitely be valid if the person knows all about Bitcoin and has an informed opinion *against* it. Giving them money to consciously change their public opinion would then be a bribe. And, frankly, I think most people have better shit to do with their time.

You're conflating "fork" in the software sense with "fork" in the Bitcoin sense. They're fundamentally different concepts. To highlight the point, literally the exact same code can create a fork in Bitcoin!
Perhaps that's a good example to make the point, actually. Imagine, for whatever reason, China's internet was suddenly isolated from the rest of the world. Imagine this went on for some not insignificant amount of time: 1 week. The blockchain would have almost certainly forked (about ~1000 blocks deep), with a China chain and a World chain. 
Which one is Bitcoin™? Should the Chinese rename theirs? Should the World rename theirs? Should one be abandoned? What makes one more valid than the other? Should you decide this by your arbitrary will or should the market decide this for itself, every person acting freely in their own rational self interest? 
Now that's obviously a different scenario to a fork by protocol change, but it's also very different to a 'fork' in the context of software development. Same word, different meaning. 
Now let's do the rule change kind of fork. Imagine, for example, governments conspire to confiscate every ASIC in the world to control Bitcoin. If the crypto community responded by hard forking to an algorithm that rendered their stolen miners useless, continuing their chain with the philosophy of economic liberty that Bitcoin epitomises, which chain is Bitcoin™? Imagine the government even introduces a radical protocol change crammed in via a soft fork. Is the state-controlled chain still Bitcoin™? Or has that sufficiently diverged from the concept to no longer be entitled to the name? Is the rebel Bitcoin, representing all of the values and economics of the whitepaper and the will of the community, Bitcoin™, despite being a hard fork?
(My personal view is that it's up the individual. "1 CPU = 1 vote")

@_date: 2017-10-02 02:55:32
I understand this...
It seems there are two points here: 1) What obligations exchanges have in the case of a hard fork, 2) What obligations a hard fork has to implement replay protection.
1: The exchange's only obligation is to honour the user agreement regarding their policy for hard forks. Maybe their policy is to always follow the chain with the most work, or to always stick to the current chain, etc. Their policy may even be something along the lines of publicly announcing and emailing all users x days in advance of their intent to 'switch' chain, so that users have time to withdraw if they choose. Whatever the policy, users should be aware and in agreement, and then it removes all confusion in times like this. Absolutely, if the exchange then does anything that contradicts this policy, users are entitled to and should sue for damages. *Users should not, are not, and cannot by default be entitled to access the coins on every chain every time a fork occurs.* 
2: From your linked article: "Indeed, the New York Agreement very specifically intends to “upgrade” Bitcoin, rather than split off into a new coin as Bcash did." I happen to think that that's the best way to approach a hard fork (ie. I do not think that replay protection is necessarily a good thing). Ideally, in the case of a fork, the chains compete and swiftly resolve with one chain prevailing and the other being entirely abandoned. I don't believe that having multiple incompatible chains processing incompatible transactions in perpetuity is healthy or valuable for the success of Bitcoin. For that reason, I think the argument could be made that no replay protection is a *good* thing, as it allows for the same valid transactions to be broadcast on both chains, keeping them as synchronised as possible until a clear 'winning' chain is established (the longer the race goes on, the worse they diverge). That's my reasoning behind it, but really all of this is beside the point, for the simple reason that *no hard fork ever has any obligation to implement replay protection*. Anyone is free to hardfork Bitcoin right now and mine that fork without replay protection; it is no crime to listen for transactions and to mine them into blocks. Nobody is defrauding or stealing anything by peacefully running software which does not harm others in any way- if you are not interested in 2X, or any other hard fork for that matter, you can simply ignore it and *nothing* will happen.

Or does the economic majority define it? By what timeline? If, in a month, Bitcoin Gold was the most valuable, would you fully accept and endorse it as the one true Bitcoin?

If a malicious actor, like a powerful state, forked Bitcoin and manipulated the chain and economy such that it was the most valuable, would you see Bitcoin Gov as *the* Bitcoin?

If people make a porno to sell it, to cover their production costs and hopefully even profit, then they have every right to. It's their work, that's the deal, that's fair. If you want to view it, then pay the fee. If you don't want to view it, don't pay the fee; if you don't want to pay the fee, don't view it. If some 3rd party authority announces that all porn is now free, does that make it ok to benefit from that person's work without paying? What right does that authority have to make such a ruling?

Perfect. Bitcoin will not grow the way we want it to by telling everyone how much they need it. They won't care. 
It will work when people want it. You can't force that upon them, you can only keep making Bitcoin bigger and better so that they start to feel that way themselves. 
At the moment, it doesn't benefit many people. The majority of people are perfectly happy with the convenience of cash and cards, and have no interest in anything to do with the block chain. And that's ok! They don't need it, they don't want it, and sometimes it's important to realise this.

Two things. First, it is their game that they developed. They can hand it out for free if they like, they can even *pay* people to play it if they like! They can also charge people to play it.
And secondly (and this might blow your mind), the "free to play, pay to win" model is profitable. It would not have taken off and it would not continue to be so popular if companies were not even covering their development costs because nobody was paying. Why would they continue to publish games in this model if they were losing money and sending their companies broke? How could they afford to create the sequel if the original sent them into financial ruin?


So, protect their intellectual property...?


You're making the point that it's different to taking physical property from someone, in that it doesn't leave them empty-handed. I agree, that's why I've been trying to avoid the use of the word "theft", though it is very similar (something to do with "lost profits"). 
It's not a victimless crime though. And there are a few examples above that I think are reasonable that you still haven't addressed. It affects individuals too, not just big business. Sometimes right here on reddit I'll see people complaining that prominent YouTubers have incorporated their content (without their permission) into their monetised videos. Shouldn't an amateur photographer be contacted before a company downloads photos from their website for use in a marketing campaign? Shouldn't clothing makers ask artists on Tumblr for permission before they use their designs in their products? Maybe they'll want to be paid, maybe they'll want publicity, maybe they'll want nothing at all. That's their right, and that's all to be worked out in the negotiations. If you can't make a deal, you don't just get to use it anyway.
And I agree with the "take apart" point too, but only so long as they do so for personal use. If they've purchased it then it's their property, and they can do with it as they please. 


I am, which is why I never said anything like that. Tell me where.


And that's fantastic. They have every right to do that and I think it's a great initiative. It's not always feasible though; it might be for the hobbyist developing some great new software in their spare time, but if Apple made iOS open licence from the beginning then there would be a lot of unemployed people, and a lot less innovation. 
Profit drives innovation.

Oh so you're not against the hard fork itself, just concerned about the way that exchanges will deal with it? That's not unreasonable. 
I suppose it depends on the particular exchange's policy regarding hard forks, and I'm not familiar with these. I don't know if they follow the chain with the most work, the chain with the most value, stick with the same chain regardless of value or work, etc. I suppose that's up to each exchange, and for its users to accept when they sign up. Certainly if the exchange betrays that policy then users have grounds to sue. 
It seems to me that you believe exchanges should stick with the same chain regardless of any other factors including hashrate, work, consensus, value, etc. ie. 'Core' *is* Bitcoin. 
For exchanges without a clear policy on hard forks then, I wonder what you think should happen. Consider this: If 2X prevails and 1X was effectively abandoned (with ~0 hashrate and ~0 value), is the exchange still obliged to follow that chain, with users having no claim to the coins on the 2X fork?

It's a little bit difficult. If someone creates digital content to market as their product, then I don't think you have any right to use that if you are unwilling or unable to pay the requested fee. You could definitely argue, however, that it gets a bit morally unclear when, due to geoblocking for example, a willing consumer is not permitted to transact with the creator. On one hand, the product is not for sale in the region, the seller hasn't really lost any potential income from that piracy and is probably completely unaware and unaffected. On the other, you've still gained from their creative endeavour and avoided paying them for that with the convenient excuse that you can't; what right do you have to profit from them against their will? 
And though I was speaking in vague terms, I was replying to a specific example. If someone produces porn and distributes it freely as art, then fair enough. If someone produces porn as a marketable product, then I'm not sure you have any right to pretend that just because you live in Germany you can ignore their pricing, costs, and intellectual property rights to claim their product for "free" due to some arbitrary state categorisation of their product.

I received this gem in a debate I was having with a guy here on reddit a couple days ago. Thought you might enjoy:

Can you give me an example where something is inversely proportional but not correlated? I can't get my head around it and I think an example will help a lot. Use the cars on the highway if you like (it seems certain to me that travel time *is* inversely proportional to and correlated with speed). 
@_date: 2015-09-26 02:14:22
Agreed. If this was meant as a counter argument, you'll have to explain how.

You're in the wrong sub if you think it's ok to do something wrong just because an arbitrary law happens to permit it. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:28:58
What if what if what if...
You are free to do whatever you like, just like everyone else. You don't get to demand others do what you want just because your choices preclude you from doing this yourself. 
There's nothing wrong with trusting all of the other miners to act in their rational, economic self-interest. That's what most people will do.

Is that why you're all so terrified of it gaining adoption and popularity?
@_date: 2018-04-28 00:30:50
Nobody put a time limit on it. Anyone is free to fork to whatever Bitcoin rules they like at any time, and they are free to advocate that chain and others are free to join them. 
There are a lot of people and businesses (growing by the day) who are very passionate about the Cash chain's principles and won't be giving up for a long time yet.

Well I'm not saying there needs to be a CEO taking home 7 figures, I'm sure most of them could operate fine without one. But there is going to be overhead to some extent, no matter what. Even at the most basic level there are costs like printing and distributing these signs with the QR codes, the computer needed to produce these addresses and the power bills to run it, administration costs of accounting for and distributing the donations (staff?), security and storage for Bitcoin keys, etc. 
The only counter argument is your point about higher trust potentially attracting higher donations. And I'm not disregarding that, there are many charities today that exist because of that demand, but they are charities that do the leg work to receive donations themselves then distribute to the needy (Donor-&gt;Charity-&gt;Needy). Donor-&gt;Needy-&gt;Charity-&gt;Needy seems to me like it *must* be less efficient.

Exactly, inherent in gold is the value committed to producing it. It's not just a matter of editing a bank balance, instead there is a complex and expensive procedure of finding, mining and refining it (which is obviously limiting). 
@_date: 2015-11-17 18:30:00
Both of which are, as you say, very expensive, which only further reinforces the value of gold. Mining and refining it requires a significant investment of value.

Why doesn't he have every right to do so?
Isn't part of the beauty of Bitcoin that anyone can fork at any time if they disagree with the direction others are taking, and choose to follow whatever rules they prefer? Who is the central authority who gets to dictate to free men what is and isn't Bitcoin?
I respect your right to call the Core chain 'Bitcoin'. I respect Ver's right to call the Cash chain 'Bitcoin' instead.

That's not true. Have a quick read of this:
@_date: 2015-11-27 15:36:39
What would be the benefit for the person in need? 
They lose control of their money to this charity, which takes its cut and restricts what they can spend it on. 
Homeless today isn't like homeless in the 1800s, they probably all have iPhones they can use to control their own wallets. And that's if they opted for Bitcoin because it was somehow beneficial to them over cash, and I'm struggling to see how that could be the case. 
And the biggest drawback is then that donators could potentially use the blockchain to get an idea of how much they are receiving, which would be catastrophic for their continued success.

Are you not a native English speaker or something?

The key is scarcity. No person or bank or government, no matter how much power they're granted, can will gold into existence. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 09:28:53
Sorry for being lazy but would you mind sending me a link that explains this well to someone with an average understanding of Bitcoin? I've always wondered about my assumption that, as time approaches infinity, the number of coins in circulation approaches zero (as people lose keys).

I'm sure everyone understands how taxation works. I object to it on ethical grounds, not because I can't comprehend it. 
I do really like paved roads actually. So much so that I would voluntarily pay for what I use.
@_date: 2016-05-04 15:48:39
How is this is a justification for taxation? 
Compared to having no car at all, I would rather have a Ferrari, a Lamborghini and a McLaren, even if the Ferrari got stolen. That doesn't mean I wanted the Ferrari to be stolen, and it doesn't make the theft acceptable. I'm no better off for having been stolen from. I would rather retain all of my property. 
Meanwhile, of course the people now driving off in *my* stolen Ferrari are going to love the Ferrari tax! 
Might I guess that your income level puts you in the majority receiving a net (short-term) gain from government redistribution? At least be honest about the unethical nature of your theft by proxy. Don't drive past my place in my Ferrari beeping the horn and waving a friendly hello like we're all good.
