iOS provides an excellent HTML5 API, which includes camera access (QR scanning). Users can even create a button on their home screen pointing directly to a website. A lot of other content banned from the official app store, like pornography, already uses this to maintain some sort of presence on iOS. Apple isn't liable for and doesn't care what you run in the browser. 
That's what Blockchain should've created instead of intentionally deceiving Apple's app store review board into approving something with functionality that dozens of other applications had already been blocked over, then astroturfing like crazy when the inevitable happened down the line. If anything, this whole fiasco has probably hardened Apple's stance on Bitcoin's legality.

I transferred money in, but before I can use it, they're demanding photocopies of my SSN, front and back, and my bank account number, as well as detailed descriptions and estimates of my use of BitStamp and Bitcoin. Um, no.

Update: After refusing the KYC, they contacted me about return of the funds being held. I provided the requested information. A day later access to my account was terminated for no specific reason, which includes the support ticket in which I was arranging the return of the funds. I've been a long time user but I really should've pulled out after the hack, this is some really sketchy behavior. Remains to be seen if I'll get my money back.
