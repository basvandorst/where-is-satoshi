That doesn't really ease anyone's mindset, because the pool admin would still control both and one random day they could point both pools to mine for pool X which they control and pool X would have the strength of ghash 1 &amp; 2.

I'm fucking with you. DO NOT BUY BFL PRODUCTS. 
KnC delivered their products and rock. 
However they are sold out of their Neptune pre orders which is why you can't buy it on their site. 
@_date: 2014-01-01 05:17:03
I bet this is BFLJosh lolol

The 600 GH/s monarch from Butterfly Labs is going to be better than the Neptune!!! KnC has failed to meet their timelines for any shipment for their ASIC systems. BFL has shipped on time since they've been around.

Trading isn't too hard. 
I don't day trade. I 36-48 hour trade I guess. 
Buy at X price. Sell at X + Y. 
Wait. Walk away from your computer. Make some coffee. Watch a movie. Listen to a song. 
Examine price. 
Repeat above. 
Let Y = a value that is high enough so you make a net profit of BTC or Fiat after your exchanges fee's. 
Just my B.02

Can confirm this happened with CPL which hosted tournaments for Counter Strike 1.6 and Source and that happened all the time. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:26:03
It will stabilize. At what point? I have no idea. But it sure won't reach Zero. At the end of the day I still think BitCoin is a marvelous creation. If it goes to $1 I would still buy as many as I could. 
Why? 
Because I can send my family that is half a world away money in a few minutes all with the ease of sitting in my living room on my laptop and clicking a few buttons. Did I mention it's not a percentage based fee? That alone is enough for me to love it. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:22:43
Why not eliminate the problem from the source and not charge him the ridicufukinglous fee. 
BitCoin QT doesn't let a transaction go through if you don't have enough btc in your wallet. Same thing can be made by the bank since your bank account = your btc wallet.

You have got some of the worst PR skills I have ever seen a "business" owner have. PR means public relations, and you my friend are absolutely the WORST I have ever seen. 
Your childish reactions to accusations could have easily been dealt with in a mature fashion instantly had you just taken a picture of your meat warehouse along with a paper with your name on it. But noooo, mr scammer gets sad because he was caught and retaliates like a 5 year old, as most scammers do. 
Just so you know, not every merchant that posts on here gets called out for being a scammer, mannnnnny merchants get up voted. Take Gyft for instance.
You should probably stop talking while you're ahead. 
Just my two cents. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:58:00
Are you... Ms. Cleo?!?
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:28:44
I wasn't trying to come off as saying its fool proof or that any investment is not a risk. Every investment is a risk. I apologize if I came off that way.  Someone who buys at $900 right now could get super shafted if it went to $1. I made a bad trade today. Bought at 1080 put the sell order for 1190 but it only hit 1145 so I missed out. So now I just wait wait wait. No panicking. That's what I was trying to get through to people. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:18:26
What the fuck did I just read?
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:08:06
I'm with you op. Just because they wrote a lengthy post many will find it believable. Not a single piece of proof. Not even in the initial post they referred to. I'm starting to take all these posts as a grain of salt. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:59:22
The fact that it's decentralized and can be made 100000% sure to the wide spread population that it's going to be decentralized, this would be the best solution as a global currency. If there is even a .0000000000000001% chance that someone can compromise the validity of the BitCoin network, then I do not support it as the single global currency. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 16:04:03

My brother went, and that's pretty much all he took clothing wise, suits, dress shirts, sweaters and more. He is looking to become an investor of some sort in the BTC economy.
This post is spot on. :)

I bet a lot of people at google have litecoin because the creator worked or used to work there when he made it.

My brother is affiliated with Bitmarkers, would you utilize their service if they entered those markets? He can pass it along to the CEO, they're both in Vegas right now for the btc conference. I sent my brother a screen shot of this thread.

Alright sounds good, forwarding this message to him as well. I'll let you know what the CEO says.

Agreed, but they have a very dense foam on top of the heat sink that takes a LOT of pressure to press down. Once the lid is screwed on there's at least 30 pounds + holding that heat sink down into the pcb. I don't think it's going anywhere.

Anyone else see where they messed up and provided false information? They said if someone had 51% of the total circulating BTC that the currency would be completely in their control. They are confusing a 51% network attack with this. Other than that, good read. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 09:18:38
The teacher is mad she didn't know about bitcoins and how she wouldn't have to be stuck in her shitty life had she known about bitcoin before it was popular. Your teacher is a cunt. Sorry to hear that you got a zero. It's no wonder our education ranking is 37th in the world. I knew how to wash a car at the age of 5 by watching my dad. This is just fucking ridiculous. 
I noticed you said you were enrolled in a cyber school, is it possible to transfer to a different one? Or just out of his/her class? As multiple other people said, please do tell your parents! 
Also, great write up!

Not rich by any means. I just feel like it will recover again. It dropped to 870 yesterday and not much was said. Drops to 800 today and everyone shat themselves. The volatility allows a lot of people to make a good profit from their trades if they would just wait.
