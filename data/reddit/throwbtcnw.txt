Gemini.   Also my Coinbase limit is much higher as well.  You can ask for increases.

When I was younger my goals were to provide college for our kids and lock in a safe retirement.  Half of that is locked into retirement investments I can't access until I'm older without jumping through hoops or big penalties.  Another chunk is in rental real estate.   Long story short most of it is not liquid.

When it shot up to $15k and then fell back down, I felt like I missed a good window to take some off the table and I resolved at that time to take advantage of the next upswing.

I asked repeatedly for it to be increased, and I believe I had to submit documentation a couple years ago to prove I was an accredit investor.

Except that my exposure in the markets is already pretty high through what's sitting in tax deferred retirement accounts and other investments.

That's exactly one of the things I said to my wife when we discussed selling a portion of our holdings.  Trying to time the market is a bad idea, so if you can sell and sleep at night it's a great plan!

Mortgage was at a lower interest rate than my investments were returning.  If you can make more money being invested elsewhere you don't pay off your house.  However I believe the markets in general are overheated, and I don't want to put more in.

I used  .   I did a test transaction and then a 65BCC conversion.  Went through in about an hour.  ShapeShift.io has limits while Changelly does not.

Of course people will need loans.  But they don't need to come from banks in the future.  I am an active investor on sites like Prosper.com which provide person to person lending.  I think platforms like that will exist in the future for crypto loans, cutting out the middle man and most importantly not relying on fractional reserve banking that creates money out of thin air and devalues the dollar even further.

From my perspective it is a psychological gain to know I fully own my home free and clear.  I feel like I already have enough exposure into the markets as it is.

Gemini.   I also have a higher limit account on Coinbase.  It does take time to go through the identity verification and get your limits increased, so start on that process well in advance of when your moon may be approaching.
After that it was sitting there on the sell screen doing math and starting at the price for an hour!

There were also stock options along the way that brought in spikes of cash at various times when companies were bought and sold.   Which happened a good bit during the dot com boom days.  You are correct though, high salary plus putting as much as possible into 401k with a decent match percentage was the bulk of the gains.

What kind of proof do you want? 
Point  means I don't like how banks keep charging more and more fees and are devaluing the dollar with fractional reserve banking, so the less I personally am connected to the existing banking system the better.

This is great advice.  And that's part of the reason that even though I have a high net worth I am still conservative.  We funded our retirement early and first, to make sure we could take care of ourselves.  Crypto has been a great fast forward button and by locking in some gains along the way maybe I can retire by 50 instead of 60.   It's not worth taking the enormous risk of losing ten years of retirement to blindly HODL at my age.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:30:43
It's not the mortgage itself.  IT's the fact that the banking industry continues to add ridiculous fees and restrictions.  You end up paying so much in extra fees for the "privilege" of being able to have a bank account.   I also feel like banks are going into risky territory again by making loans with too little money down out of greed, which could end up causing another financial meltdown.

Gemini Exchange.  And I use a local credit union for this type of banking rather than a major national chain.  I had some issues with Chase years ago using Coinbase so my advice is go local.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:04:52
It's treated like any investment.   Hold it less than a year and sell it's regular income.   Hold it longer than a year and it's long term capital gains (20%), plus any state and local taxes.

It hasn't gotten there yet, but I use a bitcoin friendly credit union so I am not anticipating any problems.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:36:19
Good job!

I converted BCH to BTC and sold only BTC.   While Litecoin and Ethereum have posted some nice gains lately I feel like those two coins have a lot more room to appreciate in value if Bitcoin doesn't solve the transaction cost issues in the next year.
I have always been in the second camp for many years, but when I look at where my money is currently invested I feel like the markets are too hot right now.  We are due for a pullback in the stock market...I believe this is the only year in like 30 years where there has not been a down month.  I just was not comfortable putting more into the market, and leaving it in cash just loses value.   I can always get another mortgage if I want to, but for right now I will take the locked in gains that paying off the mortgage represents.   Plus it is mental security too.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:37:26
That's a great strategy.   It doesn't matter if it's $1,000, $10,000 or $1M... Everyone should be balancing where their money is, especially if you can pay off debt.

Not sure what advice to give a Canadian on that part.  I honestly don't remember what I provided beyond filling out some additional information about income and assets to Coinbase.  I did have 75 BTC parked there, so I guess that was part of the reason they kept advancing my limits.
I specifically said I wanted to be able to trade a large portion of my position in advance of news for the forks and Segwit, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:18:02
I started mining in late 2013, when the BTC price had already spiked up.   So buying it directly definitely wouldn't have worked.  I used to term "mined" for simplicity.   What I did was join mining pools that were switching between the most profitable coin at the time and exchanged those coins daily or weekly for small amounts of BTC.  
And as I said in another response, for me building the miners was a way to explore all aspects of crypto because I find it fascinating.  Buying it outright didn't tickle my geek need to be more involved.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:00:23
Your math is just about spot on.  And you are correct, most of our net worth went to funding retirement plans early on.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:09:07
My CoinBase limit is $250k a day for withdrawals and $500k a day for buying/selling.  You just need to apply for increases and in my case I provided proof I was an accredited investor if I recall.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:18:57
One of the reasons that I decided to take some gains off the table was reading a few of the posts from smart people who presented good reasons for doing it.   I thought I would join those voices to help anyone else like me who was in doubt about what to do.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:27:54
I think that any coin will be able to support an extremely high level of transactions on chain.   There need to be off chain solutions if we are going to get back to the original vision of a payment network.  Otherwise you are correct the fees make this not viable for replacing your bank account... There needs to be a middle man of some sort.
I think there is only room for a couple coins to become mainstream.  Amazon wasn't the only place selling books and music online back in the day, but they got the name recognition and took over.  I think Bitcoin has the name recognition so if other problems can be solved it can continue to stay the front running.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:31:21
That may be the case, but now I can hold the rest and ride into the ground if I need to and still have achieved something amazing for it.
My advice should apply to everyone - don't lose more of your gains that you can afford to.   For some people like me that's a house, for other people it may be a new car or college for their kids.
If Bitcoin continues to rise I am pretty comfortable still having over 45 left.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:07:47
It was fun for me.  A way to play around with new technology and learn the ins and outs of it at the same time.  Buying it wouldn't have achieved that!
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:07:12
Now that I have sold it probably will go on for months longer, lol.  
I think the best thing to do is set up an automatic buy weekly on Coinbase or another exchange in a small amount and then just let things grow over time, and don't try to time your buying.   Set it and forget it.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:28:56
Gemini to bank account.
I paid regular income taxes when I mined the coins based on the current price at the time.   Now I pay capital gains taxes based on the difference in price since I have held them for long enough.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:36:27
I use a credit union for my Bitcoin stuff, never had a problem.   I pay my taxes on this stuff so it isn't any different from another investment.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:32:46
Of course.  Why wouldn't you invest $400k and make 7-8% while paying the bank 3% interest?    
But at a certain point when you have too much invested in the market and don't have confidence the bull run will continue it makes sense to shift gears!
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:11:18
My Gemini limit is $100k per day for bank transfers and higher limits for wires.
You can ask exchanges for limit increases by providing additional documentation or just having enough crypto sitting there they know you may need them.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:34:25
Yes.  Always pay your taxes, folks.  When I did the mining I paid regular income taxes on each coin that I received based on the average price of bitcoin that day.   I kept track of that in a spreadsheet.   So if I received 1 BTC when it was $1,000 I paid regular income tax on that $1,000 gain.   So now I will be taxed capital gains at 20% on the remaining $18.5k gain.
We will process that on a FIFO basis from the original cost basis spreadsheet, as each coin had a different original cost basis.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:38:39
That's a great concept.  Good luck!

My Coinbase limit is $250k.   You can go higher.
