These bars were obviously homemade, and fairly crappy too. Which is why they probably got caught. You can smelt much better looking bars than these at home.
So the question remains, how did they buy the gold with cash? My guess is they bought it direct from Colombian gold miners. They all know each other so word would spread fast if buyers came around. Lots of robberies down there but nobody is going to fuck with the cartel. Nice crooked government that would look the other way. Either that or Guyana. 
I do like your idea of forcing the problem on the distributors, but now hundreds of millions of dollars in thousands of transactions are on the blockchain forever, you made your illegal business transactions completely traceable and seizable. You can’t shuffle incoming transactions.
Of course you need to still smuggle some cash over the border because when you cash out your bitcoin they will find out who you are.

I already said the mining and computations made it different, however every other thing you said about Crypto is not even in those paragraphs.
Recalling money is a feature that I like, especially when you get a $300 fiberglass hood and every corner is broken. If you dont like that don’t use PayPal. But your book doesn’t say anything about buyer protection.
Some coins are centralized, some coins don’t require mining and prime number calculations. The fact that you can make illegally transaction with bitcoin doesn’t make it better, it makes it look bad. All Im saying is that electronic currency was 90% of the way there before, and most of the points you brought up were not even in the book.

Ok, a consumer is not going to drive to Idaho, to buy one blender from the manufacturer. They don’t even have a cash register there, or a sales floor. Amazon and Walmart perform a vital part of the sale chain, they are not a middleman.
Sam Walton was notorious for telling a manufacturer he wanted their product, let’s say a bike, for $80. But they said our bikes sell for $300! He said yes they do, but I want to buy a quarter million bikes. This was more than any distributer or bike store ever bought in the history of the company. 
Instead of the bike store, buying from the distributor, who bought from the manufacturer, Sam became the bike store who bought from the manufacturer. He cut out the middleman, literally.

1000 transactions at $5000 each? Each person isn’t going to be doing many before the IRS red flags that they deposited huge chunk of money on an exchange that they didn’t claim as income.

Oh, I wasn’t really trying to doubt your choice in spending your money however you want. For example I bought a run down crap house and used 50k in credit cards to make it nice. I could have just taken out a bigger loan on nice house. But I made way more money flipping the shitty house even at three times higher interest rate.
What I dispute is cyber as a store of value. If we are planning on using $20,000 for purchases and in the morning and crypto market is down 15% than we have to wait to make the purchase or spend 15% more coins. That is not a store of value, that’s a speculative investment vehicle, much like the flip house but riskier.
Now the line gets blurry, We can take a loan against our coins, and pay it back when the market is favorable. This is the same as a house, where you can borrow against it anytime. However, just showed that a house is an investment, but, through ANOTHER vehicle it becomes a store of value. 
The only real store of value is your ability to borrow money (from banks) against assets or cash in an account (in banks). We are fucked by banks either way. There really is no store of value in this world except banks. (Well, money in the mattress)

If someone steals my classic car and it’s worth $10K, the court awards me $10K from the thief. If it depreciates to $5000 in that time they still owe 10k , if the car suddenly appreciates in value and is worth 22K, I still get 10k. If the dollar drops 8% in value, I don’t suddenly receive an extra $800 to my award. I get 10K.

All things in a free market will quickly stabilize, regardless if there was a previous fixed price.
In 37 marijuana was made illegal. Now where MJ is legal it’s like 25% of the old price even with the huge taxes.
In 33 gold was made illegal. However
gold went UP 50% every year in the years just before and after legalization. And it actually exceeded the world market value in 75. The exact opposite of MJ.
Crude oil price sales are fixed by OPEC but  production is based on how much it costs to pump it. When barrel price hits $70, the wells in Texas fire up.
Inflation was dropping during the 30s but FDR kept the gold price propped up. Price fixing does not have any effect on an assets relation to inflation once the control is removed. There is still an entire planet out there setting the real price of the asset. 
An assets bottom price is determined by how much it costs to get it or make it. Gold will never go under $1200 an oz because that’s what it costs to get it, and miners won’t work at a loss for long. Just like oil.
Besides, the law never forbade US citizens from owning gold certificates offshore. There was no international banking regulations like today. If anything the world price of gold relative to inflation was higher than it should have been because of FDR. The dumbest president in history.

Gold prices for the last four years have pretty much hovered just above the actual cost to remove the gold from the ground. The price has not really dipped below the extraction costs. So for the millions of dollars miners invest they are taking home just a fraction of that in profit.
I’m afraid that is what we are seeing with Bitcoin, the price floor is going to be the $6000 average mining cost and there is a little profit on to as an incentive to mine.

Dude your bills are fixed, you spend let’s say $1800 a month, every month that is what is due. If you agree to be paid as .35 bitcoin a month you may not make your bills if it goes down. If you agree to be paid $2400 in bitcoin at market value, and it takes two weeks to turn it into cash, then if it goes down you just have given yourself a demotion.
Granted a credit card will help you spend it faster, but consider that your bank may drop your account too. Nothing about it seems smart especially if you live on the Midwest where there is nothing to spend bitcoin on.

I actually think we agree on most of this now. I did say the bottom price of gold though not the market price. If the cost was 1050 several years ago then that’s probably the dig price. The real costs are fuel and machines, so if they were down, there is your price.
Check a 100 year price chart for gold and look at the 30s and the 73-76 timeframe. Money can go up or down by 1000s of percent. Venezuela anyone?
Remember the 30s and 40s were the Great Depression. something had to be done to stimulate the economy. Why not control the money.
Also check your facts: no coins, no bullion, no gold certificates, no exceptions. Why get a bill printed from the govt for gold you can’t have when you can get the real thing or a Swiss bank note. You know the Rockefeller family and the Carnigies were. The knew $33 was BS on the international market.

When mining gold you don’t have to cash in, you can pay people in gold and Hodl and cash in your share at a higher price later. So people could mine below the cost as well. But to keep the industry alive the price has stabilized just above real costs, which are fairly consistent.
Bitcoin has some advantages over gold, mainly the technology is growing so fast that the bar keeps being raised, some people will mine much cheaper and hold but it won’t be the at home miner with 3 ASICS. Your right because there is less consistency in Bitcoin because of power rates, ASIC costs, building costs, difficulty level.

You have quoted prices of $68, $60 and $50 /month in just the last six weeks, you have stated your power costs to be $.045 and $.050, which obviously exceeds the monthly cost your charging, then you denied stating that power cost there was $.05.

Actually you should look that up before you say that. Gold is only one of a few metals which is completely non corrosive. It lasts forever, 
It is routinely used in jet engines where heat dissipation in seals is highly difficult without it, although we have developed ceramic matrix composites at great expense which we use too.
Billion upon billions of circuit boards have gold connectors and industries are devoted to extracting gold from them.

“If I had someone to take it”. I know ONE guy with bitcoin. He has had it since 13 he likely would give me a ride, some clothes and let me crash on his couch because he knows a portion of my holdings and understands that I can get CASH in a few days.
But I got all those things partially because of Bitcoins reputation not the coin itself. I can get cash for a gold ring at a shop within walking distance. Do you know why pimps have 4K in chains around their necks? Because cops can take their cash as evidence but the gold goes into personal property. They call their lawyer who has his client sign over his personal property to mom who goes right to the pawn shop where he bought it. Pawn owner loans him 2k and he’s out on bail. Strolls by shop and gets his chains back (again probably). Now tell me gold is less valuable. Are you getting out on bail with a Trezor?

It’s very simple, does your asset fit the definition of liquid or not? And if not will banks use it instead? It’s a two sentence answer that your turning into a thesis. Only bills and small checks fit the definition. A Starbucks receipt is not a liquid asset. Period, end of story. Goodbye

I’m dealing with an international exchange rate and then a bitcoin conversion with a 8 hour time difference. If I can get an invoice in 2 days with a send to address it’s a miracle.

There’s what happens.
@_date: 2019-10-29 06:03:45
Ok, I understand your point now. My stock account technically is not a liquid asset but I can call my broker and by the time I drive over there a check is waiting for me. 
It incurs no loss of value to exchange to fiat and the only time loss is the bank hold on the checks over $1000. I could conceivably take it someplace that would give me cash immediately. It actually passes the test of a liquid asset.
Bitcoin is comparable, but there are very few places to have bitcoin converted to fiat instantaneously.
@_date: 2019-08-16 00:20:36
I believe the majority of the population views it as very volatile, but not necessarily an investment likely to crash and burn.
A lot of people are just not prepared to take a 10% beating in one day, but most experienced crypto owners don’t even flinch at that until it happens two days in a row!

No, cash is a liquid asset by its definition. Read the definition because you still have not done so, It is backed by our GDP, our roads and bridges and buildings and any fucking thing on the planet our military decides to take away from your shitty ass county.
Yes I said small checks, besides cash they are the ONLY liquid asset. What can’t you get that?
The definition of liquid is READILY CONVERTIBLE TO CASH WITHOUT LOSS OF VALUE!!!!!! CAN YOU YOU UNDERSTAND THE WORD READILY AND HOW IT DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR ARGUMENT.
Guess what? Wire transfers ARE FUCKING CASH TRANSFERS! NOT ALL CASH IS PAPER THAT GOES IN YOUR WALLET.
Just read the definition and quit being the southern end of a northbound horse.
@_date: 2019-10-29 19:24:05
Right, the terms “rapidly” and “ without losing value” are very ill defined. I pay $7 a month to keep my fiat in the bank. Is it therefore also not liquid. A cashiers check at the bank is a few bucks. PayPal charges 3%. I guess the question is how high do the fees get before it constitutes a loss of value.
Certainly if I buy a mower from my neighbor I get 100% of its value.

?? There is no requirement that a liquid assets have to last for a particular amount of time. Only that it be readily converted to cash and that it not lose value in the exchange. This has been discussed dozens of times! Back up in your browser history and get caught up.

I routinely receive checks for 100k for selling houses and requesting checks for up to 50k when buying. There is no other medium of exchange that is usable in this circumstance, besides a wire transfer.
When I say “cash” a check, that does not mean getting a duffel bag with dead presidents on it dimwit. It means moving the money to a place that it can actually be used for further transactions.
Putting checks under your mattress was about them expiring which is not a liquid assets requirement but if you meant inflation then inflation protection is also not a prerequisite of a liquid asset.
Please look up the definition of liquid assets be for you say more dumb shit you don’t know anything about.

5000 users? I don’t think I would brag about that, especially since they are claiming to be worldwide. They registered their domain name in Phoenix just over a year ago and the home office is in France. They started having website traffic in December 2017. There is absolute zero Owner, Admin or Registry info under their URL name. The website looks kind of questionable. Personally I would avoid.

Well I did it, I turned $25 into $20.50 of BTC. The BTC can take up to 48 hours to arrive in my wallet. This process leaves dust by rounding to even dollars on both trades.
Anyway thanks for the info, just thinking 20% isn’t exactly what I was looking for. Im headed on down the list.
@_date: 2018-07-23 01:12:06
And you guys already have tons of machines that you stick cash in and paper comes out. They both just print a receipt and take 15%. BTCs really don’t help the industry at all except to provide the appearance of legitimacy.

You can link your PayPal to your credit card and that makes a buffer between your bank and the exchange. Sort of a man in the middle.

I know, trust me I will, probably just a single buying account as a middleman if nothing else. But I’m completely “all in” with this bank both as a lender and a borrower and suddenly this happens. I want to keep buying while I decide and PayPal seemed the most clean trail.

Exact to the penny, pretty long to open calculator app.
Rough to within a buck. Easy to do in your head.
Assign a value for each place in the total. Let’s say the total 1.2345 ETH at $660
1= 660
2= 66 x 2
3= 6.6 x 3
4= .66 x 4
5= .06 x 5
So 660+132+19.8 (20) + 1.32 + .30
813.33 at $660 Eth price.

Xcoins.io has a 10% “lenders” fee just so everyone knows, everything combined was about 20% fees.
Not sure how this is a loan except they hold your BTC for 15 minutes until you make payment, if you call that a loan.

Sounds like he will take the income over a number of years, thereby delaying taxes on the money and having it available for investments within the fund. Depending on his age, possibly he will withdraw after a point where his income is reduced.
Additionally if a family member is the holder of a loan, they can forgive up to 25k per year of the loan without tax implications. I don’t know enough about tax law to know of a trust fund can forgive a loan like a person can.

If your only going to buy BTC than Coinbase is an easy option, but they only have 4 or 5 coins. I would suggest transferring them to a wallet for long term or an exchange like Binance if you want to trade many different coins. But try a few, they are free to join.

Maybe the fact that Bitcoin was supposed to be currency, but failed at that because of excessive fees and so became an investment.
Then as an investment vehicle it failed by dropping 70% in six months, due to instability of the product in the market. 
Add that to the power and resource consumption involved in Proof of Work makes some people feel that they are not being environmentally friendly by supporting them.
New cryptos are selling themselves in the market by proving themselves as a utility to investment tools not the investment themselves.
