In the future, world wide adoption of Bitcoin will increase at an exponential rate, and Satoshi's will achieve parity with the US dollar [ 1 Satosh = 1 US Dollar  ] = 2.1.Quadrillion Dollars. 
We could see Satoshi's also become divisible, from 2 to 8 divisible places. Each one of these units, could be named **"FuckUBit"** ( FUB ) a perfect name to settle Tax theft.

On the bright side, they're so scared of Bitcoin and the oppertunity of freedom that it can provide. However anything that promotes freedom, will normally be invaded or attacked by force or violence, so I suggest that you HODL your Bitcoin, and ignore or expose the FUDSTERS.

Although you have just deleted your account u/MrHodl008 , I guess you're still reading this thread, probably making a few more Sock-Puppet FUDDING accounts, makes no difference, I have the proof already.
Most people don't have an idea of what the corrupt banks and their subservient GOV's will attempt to derail Bitcoin. 
The FUD will continue and the price will be volatile up and down like a roller coaster, but it will always go up. However the tech is bitcoin evolving, improving, disrupting, empowering, this is what matters. 
And for those of a nervous disposition about value/price this train will not stop until 1 Satoshi reaches parity with 1 US Dollar, just have patience young Padawans.

Good morning Bitcoin Land ;-)
I must give a slow hand clap, for the effort that has been put into the
creative **FUD** that appears on the front page of r/Bitcoin.
 
They would not be out of place on r/WritingPrompts. Has a new marketing company been
instructed to try a new creative approach to this negative FUD? however a lot of it is very cheesy!
it has that rubber neck effect of an accident on the opposite lane to a traffic accident, you don't want to look
but every one slows down and can't help themselves.
In addition to all the new user accounts that all appear to have purchased BTC at $20,000 and then sold at
$3,000 but sent it to a wrong address, which coincidentally happened to belong to a know drug dealer in Iran, hi you're all welcome to r/bitcoin.
Of course to all the **HODLERS** I salute you!!

What's down the **RabbitHODL** today?
Winters creeping in and it's getting cold and grey. It's also wet and damp, perfect weather for trolls and other nasty bugs like roaches.
The MSM news is not any better, it's there to wear you down, a lot of doom and gloom predicted for Bitcoin. As for the FIAT value, well it appears Moby Dick has risen and is basically FUDing about with the price. All the main exchanges that utilise KYC &amp;  AML are basically a cartel and work for the Empire,  their main function is to suppress the FIAT v BTC price for their banking masters.  
In addition we have a few very old fossil's that have escaped the home, and are rabbiting on about a shiny metal that is filled with tungsten, i would suggest you ignore them until the hot milk kicks in and they fall asleep. Some of you may be feeling down, but don't despair, the co-ordinated FUD is just evidence of how desperate they're, as the fiat banking &amp; stock markets go [BOOOOOOOOOOOOM!! trust me]( ......Tick! Tock! MF's
**However!!!** don't lose heart you are part of something historic, Bitcoin just passed 10yrs against all the odds, and the [Honey Badger doesn't give a shit]( 
So all you bitcoiner's HODL steadfast and steady freedom doesn't come cheap, self sovereign doesn't come easy. If you wake up and feel a bit despondent because of a little dip, or some inbred obsolete troll is spreading shite, FUCK IT! and buckle up!!! the ride is going to be epic.

I believe you are referring to **"Moby Dicks"** ( MD's),
this type of whale is the worst. 
They are not interested in lowering the price to re-buy, they are only interested in dumping or crashing the price to cause FUD. For example.. they purchase 1000 Bitcoin for $10,000 each and then dump them for $2,000 each
when the price starts to rise, it's all to cause fear and keep the Bitcoin price as low as possible.
Of course they lose money, but when you can print it out of fresh air it matters not.
However! they will have to re-buy and rinse and repeat, this will only be sustainable until the exchanges run out of coins.

Good morning Bitcoin Land ;-)
Today's tip!... Stack Sat's... a FIAT winter is coming.
What is **FIAT**?
"Fiat money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver. The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand and the stability of the issuing government, rather than the worth of a commodity backing it."
How can you escape the enslavement of your corrupt government? 
With Bitcoin, which will be one of the last non violent opportunities, to opt out from tryanny and corruption of your government and their criminal bankster's. 
Begin by dumping your FIAT and loose change into a [coinstar]( and get some Bitcoin or stack some Sats.
@_date: 2019-08-06 14:04:47

The powers that be, must be worried, they're flooding this sub with their cannon fodder trolls, new sock puppet
accounts, wannabe traders, *"who don't have a clue by the way"* it's like a FUD fest in here ��, it smacks of desperation.
To your average Joe, don't let them scare you out of your **bitcoin lifeboat ticket**, HODL onto it, no matter what
the trolls and naysayers say. They have also bought bitcoin and their sole purpose is to short and dump it to cause panic, they can only do that for a limited period of time.
In fact just Stack some more sats, if you're not use to this sub or Reddit in general, it can seem like the sphincter of humanity at times, and that's why you should ignore most of that negative FUD, it's sole purpose is to wear you down.

Of course we have Brexit fiasco, but that is just a catalyst to the end of the EURO. 
In addition we have a small matter of outstanding USA FIAT debt, which is just shy of [23 Trillion Dollars]( that's not withstanding the [world FIAT debt](  I'll leave you to do the math's.
How could I not mention [Deutsche Bank]( that's right they're cutting 18,000 bank jobs in Germany alone.

"Bitcoin auctions have been held by other governments and entities.

Bitcoin’s price has skyrocketed since then, and today the same amount would be worth over **$22 million**."

Hope you all had a nice weekend, tut! tut! it appears we have a slight troll infestation ��
If you're new this could appear to be a problem, but fear not it's a sign. Let me explain.. the
more trolls, bankster shills, and wannabe traders appear in r/bitcoin, nothing more than a signal for major FUD.
Of course this means they want to attempt to cause panic....**yaaaawwwwnnnn!!!** it's so boring

 4: You took $25 and went all in.
 5: Bitcoin was a bitch and dumped you.
 6: You now wander the cursed sub lands of Reddit for ever, in search of your lost love, FUDDING her name every chance you can get.

Can you feel the calm before the storm, the battle for the FED.
The desperation of the Central Banks. Ken and &amp; Barbie doll pundits on
Bloomberg spewing out any BS to cover the cracks of the leaking dyke.
However! drum roll for the hero of the hour, as Zuck Bucks or Fedbookcoin  will rescue them from the
incoming cluster fuck.
I suggest you buckle up &amp; **HODL** your precious Bitcoin with some popcorn and 
watch the show.

The price should be reflected by supply and demand, regrettably that function has been hijacked by a cartel of legacy facing exchanges and wall st bots that have just one function..... **SHORT**.
**However!** there is a diminishing limited amount of Bitcoin liquidity that is available to partake in this game. 
At some point the pressure of the imploding stock and fiat markets will send demand for bitcoin through the roof. 
To Joe public, fuck the traders, fuck the bankers and fuck the naysayer trolls, never ever sell your Bitcoin, it's your lifeboat from an incoming world economic cluster fuck, that will be of epic proportions.
Parity is the key, **1 $at = 1 Dollar**, that's the real value you have to keep in mind, but they're hoping that you don't realize that fact. **HODL**

Yes maybe you're correct a lot of my posts could be "low quality" according to whatever bench mark you're using. 
However!... firstly, I don't have the luxury or the permission to stickie any post that I make, irrespective if they have any quality at all, secondly it appears that some of the posts I make have a positive [impact and touch kindred spirits](  thirdly I don't recall the last time **you!** personally made a post that had as many up-votes.
It was not so long ago where an article was made about this sub, and the diversity of posts received from technical posts, to "memes" to frivolity like Honey Badger. Of course this sub has suffered an appalling troll/shill and FUD infestation in the past as you are well aware of, and some users have tried to counteract this negativity with some humorous and positive insight/push-back. 
I don't mean to be polemic.. but it is crystal clear that for some reason you have a bee in your bonnet about me, I don't know who you're apart from the fact you're one of the mods of this sub.
I also noted that you're are quite sensitive about anybody referring to your modding abilities, and I might be walking the ban tight rope in just this response alone, and no offence but the FUD in this sub has been of the richter scale for quite awhile and many of my posts are in response to that fact.
I will take heed of what you have said, and attempt to up the quality, and  hope you will cut me some slack in the interim. Thank you ;-)

Not replace.. **"erase"**.
When the penny drops *"excuse the pun"* and the epiphany hits the great unwashed, that **"shit 1 Satoshi = 1 US Dollar"** and there are one hundred million of those units in 1 Bitcoin,, you do the maths. To spend $5, $10, $100, $3,500 or $20,000, even $50,000 won't seem a gamble. A tsunami of global adoption will occur.
However! the corrupt elite and their criminal banks have a problem, on one hand Bitcoin disrupts their free lunch from transaction fees, on the other hand if Governments buy Bitcoin and utilise it for their reserves, the profit can be used to erase their National Debt. **Bitcoin =Digital Gold**
The scumbag politician's have already bought Bitcoin and are secretly buying, the Central Banks are holding up the FIAT market's for as long as they can, to maintain the ponzi scheme or backroom agreements implode and a Sovereign Nation goes rouge and buys Bitcoin. The problem also for the Banks is their mantra of **"Fuck the slice I want the pie"** they don't control Bitcoin, but they can print FIAT and pay any amount for Bitcoin. Then they will pump it to $1000 per Satoshi.
As for the public, well they can spend $10 and buy some Bitcoin now or Satoshi's because it's divisible to 8 Decimal Places, weather they wish to miss the latest installment of XFactor or the Ken and Barbie doll pundits on MSM is another matter.

What I'm talking about is something you fail to overstand, I can't tell if you're part of the herd a troll or just dumb. Each Bitcoin is made up of 100,000,000 units referred to as a Satoshi, which will attain parity with the US Dollar. **[ 1 Satoshi = 1 Dollar ]**
Whilst you're chewing grass and drinking oversize milkshakes before the latest netflix offering, your beloved corrupt governments with their criminal banking friends, have raped and enslaved humanity and laden future generations with trillions of FIAT debt, the biggest ponzi scheme known to  man.
In the interim of the aforementioned parity being achieved, and the apocalyptic financial collapse, your beloved masters have spent millions on demonising one of the greatest inventions since the internet to free the enslaved. However the corrupt elite and their Banksters are spending millions of Fiat demonising Bitcoin with their fake news MSM propaganda machine, whilst buying it in secret.
So you carry on standing in the rain waving your pretty little flags, voting for fictional demockery dumb, dumb, dumb.

I believe we should reserve one day in the week in r/bitcoin where all the establishment Trolls, Banking shills, &amp; Altcoin-pumpers FUDsters, can post there crap without any moderation or recourse.
Let the detritus of humanity have a free day to post there crud, maybe a Sunday/FUDday, thereafter the other 6 days should be reserved specifically for Bitcoin related topics.
We could have a special echo chamber volunteer squad that filter, erase, delete, ban, remove, any post or comment from any FUD related post or comment. Including those that relate to Alt-Coins or scam ICO's.
Does anyone have any ideas how this could be implemented?

Parity young Padawan, **9,398,012 million Satoshi's**, when 1 Satoshi = 1$ all will become clear.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:34:07
**Firstly**, r/bitcoin was hijacked and infiltrated a long time ago, by the powers that be and their minions, that allow 90% FUD posts and not about the tech.
**Secondly,** I believe each Satoshi will achieve parity with 1 US dollar,  in the interim of that event, everything including price action is purely theater. 
**Thirdly**, the alleged bad news/FUD will never abate irrespective of the alleged current market price, due to a few factors, 
1. Most MSN is owned by the same entities that print fiat, and therefore such media outlets will continue to manufacture that propaganda AKA fake news without limitation.
2. The **HERD** / **SHEEPLE** mostly are easily distracted with vacuous BS, an unpalatable truth, but fact. Subsequently they can be herded like cattle or coerced  like turkeys voting for Christmas.
3. **Bitcoin**, if you wish to attach a fiat price to obtain a "free market valuation discovery" the minimum in this respect is 2.1 quadrillion US dollars market cap that equates to 100 million US dollars per bitcoin. In spite of this fact you can still obtain 1 Bitcoin at currently less than £10,000 without any violence upon the HODLER, utilising all the above disclosures, which would cause panic or doubt among the so called weak hands. 
4. If the above fails, the favored tool of choice, is for the powers that be to purchase the aforementioned Bitcoin in exchange for US dollars, which can be printed **"Ad infinitum** and then resold back to the market at a price less than was purchased.  The effect of such a market strategy is in effect as we speak.
5. The simple truth is, what US Dollar price do you attach to your **freedom?**, it appears that Lambo's and copious amounts of cocaine seem to be the selling trigger, as purported by the MSM, and vacuous visible subservient tools of the Cabal.

**The shame of** r/bitcoin
The fact that this thread continues to exist in r/bitcoin and is not removed or deleted, just like many of the alt-coin or marketing scams, is one of the fundamental failures in the Bitcoin ecosystem.
**TAX** is nothing short of legalised theft under the threat of violence. 
It may have been sold to the masses as monies utilised in the building or maintenance of the public infrastructure, however we know that not to be the case, as the majority of funds are utlised for the weapons and arms manufacturing companies, **death** and **profit** aka **death and taxes**.
One point of observation that should be **noted**, it's crystal clear that some of the mods on Reddit or within this sub, tow the line or worse, with the Financial Institutions, corrupt elite and broken governments, as evidenced by the existence of this thread and OP.
It was meant to be **"Peer 2 Peer"** there was no caveat attached that read "don't forget to give them their cut via TAX"

**FUD OFF!**
The elite and corrupt cartel, that partly exists above or within the 1% of the World Population, have always manipulated and wielded  power.
Below this exist another 2% who are useful idiots, that are subservient to the 1%, but can be utilised to misled and shepherd the masses that consist of around 80%, especially the indoctrinated Sheeple.
Another 15% are the neanderthal knuckle dragger's, recruited to be enforcers, to protect the above, especially when Demockery does **not** maintain the status quo of the above.  
Those who resist enslavement and are en-lighted or woke, consist of around 2%.
Bitcoin is a huge step towards changing the status quo, and will be attacked by the powers that be, utilising all those useful idiots. You'll note many in r/bitcoin constantly posting FUD, and shilling for the banks, and trolling any anti-bitcoin crud they can think of.
The level of FUD has reached an ATH, However! Honey Badgers doesn't give a fuck!  HODL and take your Bitcoin of the exchanges.

For example: if your apartment was infested with cockroaches and you pretend they don't exist, that would seems a bizarre way to get rid of the problem. To ignore them is one thing, but when they are in the furniture or food, the apartment losses it's charm as a home or a sanctuary.

Hi Phil **firstly** reel your neck back in, and lighten up. ;-) 
**Secondly!** ["HODL" Give nothing and take everything"] refers to [this]( scene from the film 300, and depicts the courage and determination required in times of adversity, a perfect analogy of HODL in my opinion.
If you require something a little less trivial well I refer you to [this]( which I posted yesterday.
I suspect you mistakenly believe I am new to this space, I have been around far longer than 3 or 4 years, that some believe to be ground zero, that's generally when the suits stepped in.
However! as you state "Bitcoin is YOUR project" I never saw the caveat that said "although it has to be approved by Phil first",
On a Plus side I do like your [Meme]( *which proves you do have a sense of humor*. ;-) 
*See you in the trenches* ;-)
