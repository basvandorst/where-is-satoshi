i have already talked to someone from gyft and bitpay. no transaction was made on the blockchain and that is verified by me, gyft and bitpay.  the window did in fact time out but that was after btc-e had shown the transaction as complete. so my issue is now with btc-e.

be very careful with tigerdirect and bitcoin. i had placed an order with bitcoin and it took 9 days to get to my house after paying for 3 day and the item was broke/not working so i returned it for refund. that was on the 7th and i still have no clue how i will be refunded. i was told gift card, then i was told on the website to call and verify info. while on the phone after being sent to 4 different departments i was told i would receive bitcoin to my wallet and to email my bitcoin address. ok i did that and the next day i was told i didn't need to send an address i was going to get a gift card.... which i still haven't gotten because the refund process hasn't finished even thought the website specifies up to 5 business days. today was 5 business days and still no idea when i will get refunded

i have $150 worth of coins missing in a transaction with gyft. for those not familiar with gyft its a place you can trade bitcoin for gift cards. gyft never received my coins and the transaction doesn't show up in the blockchain. i have sent a message to btc-e about this transaction 3 days ago now with no response. anyone else have this problem? i want to transfer out all my funds but im afraid they will put the rest of my coins in limbo as well
