Yes. Just pointing out the fact that he should be more than ready to buy drugs for bitcoin now that he has publicly doxxed himself...

That's not true. I have had my bank account linked to CB for over a year and have not been able to verify my identity for instant purchases since the feature was rolled out. I buy &lt;$100 worth of coins every week and always have to wait four business days. Coinbase's verification process has been broken for months.

Only if you can get through their absolutely horrendous verification process. I dealt with it almost daily for seven months. I eventually gave up and started buying on Monday so I receive coins by Friday.

Why the fuck has no one built upon what BitInstant had going for awhile?! That was one of the easiest ways to buy BTC with cash in an area where the nearest LBC seller is hours away. All I had to do was bring a wad of bills to Walmart customer service desk, fill out the MoneyGram slip, give the cashier my shit and recieve SMS confirmation within SECONDS! I even got my buddy, who is not tech savvy at all, to download the blockchain.info app on his iPhone, (before the Apple crackdown) and get 1 BTC (~$95) this way. There really isn't anything like this in the US to my knowledge. I stick to Coinbase for weekly buys, but I haven't been able to be verified for level 2 instant buys for over a year now... We need a reliable cash exchange service that anyone can use at their local grocery store help desk.

I thought that ZipZap took care of BitInstant's payment processing back then?

Do you just go through the normal Buy/Sell tab? I make purchases almost every Monday and it always arrives in my wallet by Friday afternoon. No option for instant buys unless I can get through the fucking horrible verification questions.

I would consider El Chapo a little more notorious than our boy Ross...
