I think everybody agrees and are tired of this conversation. We as the biggest BTC comunity should start doing this , after some time it will catch up.

While alts are making bull tun it will last. But otherwise not. Because you cannot get fiat into exchanges in weekends.

I believe Danish police have announced that they can trace btc transactions. They are not willing to disclose how, but are willing to help other law enforcement agencies.

Make your own bill. Take some telecom, electrical or other companies bill as a example and photoshop shit out of it. Then print it, fold it, crumple it a little bit and scan it. Make it seem real and everything will be ok ;)

I'm thinking more along the lines of reenactment of 2g1c

Yep $1000. I wouldn't trade it for fiat. Maybe some part I would spend to buy some necessities. No luxuries.
