�� Satoshi Nakamoto was (is?) Leonardo Da Vinci! It all makes perfect sense.

Currency, deflationary currency encourages saving and storing idle currency, not money. Inflationary currency encourages storing idle money and dumping currency. Deflationary currency encourages dumping idle money and storing currency. 
The etymology for money is thus: 
From Middle English moneie, moneye, from Old French moneie (“money”), from Latin monēta (“money, a place for coining money, coin, mint”), from the name of the temple of Juno Moneta in Rome, where a mint was. Displaced native Middle English schat (“money, treasure”) (from Old English sceatt (“money, treasure, coin”)), Middle English feoh (“money, property”) (from Old English feoh (“money, property, cattle”), whence English fee).
Money is the thing that has value, currency is the thing that represents the thing that has value. 
Cattle, property, land, these things have value, but they are hard to divide and trade, except for cattle, which isn't durable. 
Currency is the thing we use to represent the money. Bitcoin has the capability to be both the thing and the thing traded. (though, in practice [at least for now] bitcoin is treated more like a money and the various currencies more like currencies). So, in an inflationary currency (ie. $$) money (ie. BTC, gold, land, etc.) is stored. If the USD were to begin to deflate and the price of bitcoin in USD were to begin to drop, it would trigger people to store USD at the expense of BTC. 
If we ever (when we finally) get to the point where everyone is using BTC the USD will find itself without value and we will finally have stability in the world financial markets.
Look at what happened after WW2, when the war spending stopped and people began releasing their stored gold and silver notes (money-backed currency) the economy boomed like never before. BTC and ETH, etc..., can do the same thing for America and the world, but we will have to get off of the fiat teet though.

The author might be close to right. On Dec. 10, 1999 you could have bought 100 shares of Amazon stock for $106 per share, $10,600 investment. On September 28, 2001 your investment would have been worth a measly $597. You might have been tempted to cash out. But you might have been smart enough to hold. Today those shares would be worth $98,500.
If you had held your money and invested your $10,900 at the 2001 price, it would be worth $1,789,400. 
I think Bitcoin is here to stay, like Amazon. 
Like Amazon, those who invested at $4400 will still make a lot of money. Those who invested lower will make even more.

HA! I haven't checked since I bought in at $800. I take it from random reddit posts on my news feed that I am still well into the black. That's good enough for me. When I hear rumors of six figures, I'll start checking then.

Can we start a  movement to jointly celebrate the gift of bitcoin to the world and honor the legacy of the man with the idea by committing to carry on the spirit of what he created?
That would disempower anyone claiming to be Satoshi while serving to help ensure the legacy lives on as more than a legend.
