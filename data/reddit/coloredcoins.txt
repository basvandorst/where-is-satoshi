The concept of a colored coin is to represent a real world value of an asset in its digital form. This value must be tied to a real-world promise by the asset issuers, that they are bound to honor and redeem the actual value of those digital tokens in the real world when the owner wish to reclaim them.
Every colored transaction is carried by Bitcoin (satoshis) on top of the Blockchain.

Read the latest blog post on why there's a new implementation in the first place and about it's new features:

In the case you conciser each bitcoin as a "share" in a company called "Blockchain", this could be true.

You are right. these are all different implementations and proposals for a Colored Coins protocol as the concept.
Each implementation suggests different abilities with it's pros and cons. One of the main new features in recent new implementation developed by Colu, is the use of torrents files to store the metadata and keep it decentralized. Another powerful new tool is the Rule Engine which allows you to define specific abilities of an assets like time limitations - expiration date, limited access to specific people and more. It is up to you to choose the implementation that serves your needs best.

Thank you we are excited as well

Hi, I think there was a misunderstanding since the new protocol is on top of the Bitcoin Blockchain and not an alt chain as mentioned.
@_date: 2015-05-26 09:13:13
It is going to be 100% open source! 
@_date: 2015-05-27 07:55:13
Everything 100% open source!

Nope, it uses this colored coins protocol:
The protocol uses DHT for metadata and Colu doesn't have access to the private keys.

We would love to help you further more with that experiment.

Colored-Coins transactions are the same as any other Bitcoin transaction so you can use any technology Bitcoin uses.

Yes, since lightning network is a payment channel on bitcoin blockchain, there's no reason why it won't work with colored coins, as they are another layer on the bitcoin blockchain as well. Anything you can do on top of bitcoin blockchain you can do with colored coins.

That's a good question when it comes to crypto in general and not necessarily CC. In most cases, you would need to hold your private key, and make sure to back it up incase your phone got stolen for examp. But there are future solutions for users who don't want to take the responsibility of holding that key, and for someone else to manage it for them.

You can use the new Colored Coins API and the new Colored Coins Block Explorer. Once you implement the specs or the API you can potentially work with any Block Explorer. Soon enough we will be releasing the new Block Explorer  code as well on Github.

Are you asking why we haven't updated 80 bytes OP_RETURN returns? If that's the case we are about to do that soon enough...

please contact us at: contact 
We can schedule a Skype talk about that with our technical team as well if needed.

As for the issuance - you can issue shares - digital assets -  on the blockchain using Coloredcoins.org protocol or if you whish to use a ready to use, end to end platfrm including mobile digital assets wallet for ios and androind, you can use Colu Platfrom.

Take a look into the quick asset issuance and download the app
(available for iOS and Android). If you need further help you can write to: contact

Have you tried the quick asset issuance of  platform?
You can issue an asset on the blockchain in 30 seconds, add a picture and as much metadata as you want. The idea of Colu is making CC - blockchain tech easy for end users. 
You have also a mobile digital assets wallet available for iOS and Android where you can easily send receive and manage digital assets and community coins. 
Best if you join the Slack channel on coloredcoins.org to ask all these questions... 
@_date: 2015-10-14 07:54:45
Yes there are!
You're welcome to check out some of our integrations on coloredcoins.org. You could also join our Slack channel
 where you could find some great ideas and projects that are planning to use and implement Colored Coins.

The minimum amount to make a Colored 
Coins transaction (aprox 600 satoshi) acts as the carrier of the transaction regardless to the bitcoin value
