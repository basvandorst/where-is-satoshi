Lol hopefully. All I see is dips 
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:14:06
I bought it at 15.8 so yea it's dipped tremendously since 
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:15:07
Bought at 15.8k trying to stay strong 
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:30:14
Because I bought some, sorry should have warned you all 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:20:54
Bought 1 full bitcoin at 15.8k never have I lost so much money so fast. At least it wasnt at 19k 
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:33:49
Its been crashing...
@_date: 2018-01-14 06:11:52
Still dropping
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:33:50
Funny how we were all saying its likely to get there 1 day ago lol 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:44:08
Lol same boat here. Praying to god for a correction then im gonna HOLD and never watch these prices for a while.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:27:02
It just dipped lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:40:58
Wouldnt having corporations or more people adopt bitcoin bring more users which will make it raise instead of dip? Just thinking logically but of course im not that great on this whole bitcoin thing haha
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:28:07
Agreed. I got money I wanna invest but Im praying for a dip at 10.2k then I can just invest it all
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:27:25
I dont get it. Why is that bad? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:37:39
And its back. Damn i missed it 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:05:30
So doesn't that mean it'll rise more not crash if everyone wants to jump the train 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:48:03
Why? Because it'll crash? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:51:21
Lol well not even 1 month in and its broken 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:22:15
Whats happening 12/10??
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:40:05
I need a drop. I keep waiting for a drop but theres no drop. 11k and still going up smh
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:02:57
Thats what I've been waiting for since 11k but it just keep climbing up. I feel like a dip will never happen
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:40:10
Haha we all are. Everything is just speculation no one can predict unfortunately otherwise we'd all be millionaires 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:30:20
Ive been hearing this since 12k and yet no correction
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:36:50
Its not looking like MT Gox right now at all
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:22:43
Whens that? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:23:40
I had to buy through coinbase but it registered my order. Its not in my account yet but it will be available in a couple of days. By doing this now I can purchase through GDAX with no fees. I think you have to make an initial payment through coinbase first before going through GDAX
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:36:39
You think there will be a correction? I feel like bitcoin is getting alot of attention now so everyone is waiting for the dip meaning as soon as it hits itll ramp back up. I think the days below 10k are now over but honestly wish they werent because thats when i was planning on buying more
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:16:22
Here's hoping but so far it aint looking like it. It dipped $900 and then it rose back up
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:56:44
The dip is still happening 7900 and dropping 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:21:58
What about bankwires? Shouldnt those be instantaneous? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:22:29
Lol great bitcoin is down to &lt;10k and I cant make a purchase 
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:16:04
Can you link your bank account to your gdax account so you just transfer funds? Been tryign to do it and its not working 
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:56:27
Perfect. Someone told me I had to first have money into my GDAX account before buying but that would have taken 4 days and I wanna buy bitcoins today 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:23:15
Can't you just put your keys on a usb stick you have lying around or just write it on a piece of paper? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:55:54
Yea I think best price to buy is low 10k like 10,300
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:12:50
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:06:55
Damn I'm still seeing the error to hard reset the browser
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:58:48
Would there be a dip that low though? Bitcoin has gained more hype which means when it even drops below 10k new money is getting pushed into bring it back up
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:03:32
Is it back up for anyone?
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:02:08
Nobody knows, I personally think it will drop because people will think its the top so they'll sell 
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:47:12
Aw man I guess I have to use coinbase then if I wanted to buy today
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:28:59
Well then hopefully it dips more by tomorrow.....
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:43:21
Well coinbase you can link with your bank account and buy the bitcoins instantly you just wont get it deposited in your account for another week. does gdax let you buy instantly when you have your bank account linked or do you need to first deposit funds into it?
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:55:33
It crashes then rises again
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:12:05
But it says 4 business days on their site. Its been 5 business days now total of 7 days lol
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:19:13
That worked :D just bought $300 worth of bitcoins and it dropped 5 seconds after LOL
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:40:05
Personally I think it'll dip at 10k because everyone will sell then itll ramp back up again. But again no one knows 
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:19:48
Meh I don't think so. There's so much hype now behind it people will keep fueling it 
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:12:59
What does this mean? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:23:11
Whens that?
