Hey guys... what is with the downvotes!?!?
 I said it over on the tax subreddit, and I will say it here too:  But I'm not actually sure that the IRS has much credibility here.. I mean - have they heard of "notice and comment"? It's a real thing. The fact that before the IRS issued this FAQ today there was a valid disagreement among tax professionals re: how bitcoin should be treated in certain contexts, suggests that the IRS did a little bit more than "describe[] how existing general tax principles apply to transactions using virtual currency."

The IRS is talking about it in terms of income tax, not property. So, when the IRS is calling bitcoin property, what it really means is that every single bitcoin transaction is treated like a barter. For example, suppose you buy a painting for $50, and then the artist gets famous, so you trade it for a $50,000.00 car. the $49,950.00 (the DOLLAR value you got for the painting - presumed to be its FMV) is treated as a capital gain when you "spend"/"trade" the painting. So the question was "can I get taxed for spending bitcoin" and the answer, according to the IRS, is now "yes."

Until this "notice"/FAQ is passed with proper Notice and Comment procedure it is nothing more than a statement of the IRS's position on the matter. Sure - the IRS *says* that bitcoin is merely property under existing law, but reasonable minds can disagree on that. Until this is a treasury regulation, it doesn't carry the force of law.

I would love to *argue* the test case. But I agree that I wouldn't wan't to be it. You are right. This is *non-regulatory guidance.* We don't actually disagree on the facts. And as you say "one can certainly make the argument that the IRS is wrong." That was my entire point.

This is incorrect under the IRS view. There is no exemption for straight bartering.

this link is N/A. Bitcoin is property, not currency (says the IRS).
