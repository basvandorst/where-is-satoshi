Just built this Bitcoin Ticker for my raspberry pi. Github repo to download the files is here: 
Please report any install issues here, and I'll do my best to assist:
My setup is an old raspi v2 b+, and this case / screen:

Thanks for the compliments. If you get stuck setting it up, you can submit an issue ticket on the github repository here: [  I can try and point you in the right direction to get it working properly.

Currently it changes direction based on whether it's a buy or sell. I'll keep in mind your thoughts, thanks. Just started building it a few weeks ago, likely will iterate twords a smooth UX over time with upgrades.

HODL, LOL.
@_date: 2019-08-06 20:13:45
Ok, lol. Github download link is in the video description on youtube.com. :)
@_date: 2019-08-06 23:34:29
Cool, your welcome! :) Looks good as a minimal UX there. I may add javascript settings eventually, so people can tweak stuff without more than parameter changes.

I have an app that texts / emails / alexa alerts upon certain percent or more changes, but it requires a website / and "cron job" (runs every X minutes by itself). I haven't watched the price as much since adding those features to it. I just wait for a text.

Agreed a bit. I believe technical analysis should be done more on what well known / reputable devs are saying and working on (dandelion, schnorr, lightning, etc), instead of charts, or you really miss the bigger (long term) picture. Not all of the newly-inducted wall street folks get that you can get TONS of info off github, mailing lists, etc that you just cannot do in the stock market...so they may be doing their chart thing TOO MUCH without taking into account this information. That said, I think it IS NOT total nonsense because so many people do it and believe in it, that it's a market mover when chart signals appear, because people strongly believe in it.

LMFAO. But I didn't post in @_date: 2018-03-31 14:54:50
Well said.
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:29:46
Agreed, sorry. I'm mostly an altcoiner and didn't realize I should have posted this news from another site. Gotta catch up on bcash's shillfest a bit better.

Any native token I believe is usually a commodity, ICO tokens on utility chains I believe usually are securities unless they have real utility.

Lol, good one :-)

This is coming from a group that happily took documents from Russian hackers to get Trump elected. I wouldn't pay too much attention to them whining over the Feds possibly court\-ordering CB to close their account.

What country's police will you call when a gang of armed people robs you of that BTC at gunpoint. Don't let it get to your head, it's just new tech, not the rebirth of god. Humans need structured society to thwart violent gangs / armies from overtaking everything in their path (Rome, Genghis Khan, etc).

Sell high, buy low...that simple.

At least he didn't cry, lol.

Fuck a bunch of whining panzies, crying because they lost a revenue stream in a country with laws to keep crazy fuckers in their place. To each their own.

If you only move your pre-fork ETH and never touch your ETC ever, a replay attack can still work the opposite way as well: moving your matching ETC to the same addresses you moved your ETH to. So if you ever think you might want to use your pre-fork ETC in the future, move it to a brand new address NOT on both chains via this contract:

Sorry bud. HODL a few more minutes, it'll get there again.
