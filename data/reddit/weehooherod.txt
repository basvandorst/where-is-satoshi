stc is the greatest

Sorry but it just isn't worth the hassle to me. I'm tied into sites like Newegg/Amazon (2 day shipping subscriptions) so USD is the way to go for me in this case.

Shucks. Bitfloor is my only option for buying right now. Hopefully it is back up soon.

I traded my bitcoins for USD via bitfloor so I could buy once MtGox resumes. If they don't get back online in time, well...fug.

I also found that part strange. I bought through bitinstant using cash. I didn't have to show a utility bill or proof of residence but I did have to provide my name, number, and show my ID. I assume this was for the company ZipZap that was handling the payment part but it still threw me off.

Sorry but I realized that I could be the one screwed out of my bitcoins with a PayPal complaint here. I'd rather work with something like Bitfloor.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:12:24
I'm waiting until MtGox goes back online to see if things really go crazy.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:57:36
Bitfloor is trading at $80 right now.
@_date: 2013-05-29 22:56:41
I looked into localbitcoins. Nobody in my area is buying at a reasonable price.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:01:11
Remember, bitfloor's exchange rates are far lower than MtGox (if you're cashing out at least).

Apparently nobody here has been on the Internet for more than 8 years. Here, have an upvote to counter those downvotes. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:39:25
I've got 2.102 btc to sell for $250. Do you have PayPal?
@_date: 2013-06-01 06:08:56
I read this as "Reddit wire-tapping has been enabled for all users with the bitcoin bot!"
*re-positions tinfoil hat*
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:11:20
Perfect. I had sold at $120 and was waiting for the price to dip. I bought once this happened so I'm back in again.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:44:18
I hope my buy comes in at the right time. I put in a $200 order on BitInstant using cach about 20 minutes ago. I'm just here F5'ing my wallet address on blockchain.info.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:37:41
I payed cash at a CVS via ZipZap about an hour ago using BitInstant. They got the order and the bitcoins were sent to me within 15 minutes or so. Maybe they are at high demand right now.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:43:31
Did you get your bitcoins in the $170 valley?
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:10:26
I lol'd.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:23:35
Madison WI. I'm currently transferring my bitcoins to Bitfloor though. Sorry if I got your hopes up.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:34:07
That would be amazing! Hopefully Bitfloor gets things together before MtGox starts trading again. I want to be there with my measly $200 to scoop up some cheap bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:52:41
Did MtGox just go back online?
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:25:08
Bitinstant.com is the answer
You get bitcoins in like an hour. I bought $500 in bitcoins the last 2 days (lol bad timing). They charge a ~4% + 3.95 fee for each transaction. I went the route of paying cash at CVS and having bitcoins automatically transferred to my wallet.
Their site is confusing for first timers so watch this: 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:19:54
I too am playing with $500 and am waiting to buy once Mt. Gox is back up.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:08:06
No. You can only get preorders in. By the time they ship mining difficulty will go up so much that it will be tough to get a return on your investment in a decent timeframe.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:39:22
That seems like the case to me. I bought today at $213 and regretted it after seeing it drop to $170. Even if I did put it off longer I doubt I would have played my cards right.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:58:05
I didn't buy with mtgox, I used bitinstant. The bitcoins are showing up for my wallet address on blockchain.info now. Overall the process took BitInstant about 15 minutes to give me bitcoins. I got it at $213, I wish it had taken longer now!
@_date: 2013-05-29 22:13:16
I don't have a dwolla account, does it take long to set up? If so, looks like I'll be going with the bank transfer.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:48:15
Sorry but I decided I'd rather work with an exchange. Especially since I'll then have funds to buy bitcoins immediately again.
