I can do that too if you would like? I doubt there'd be a significant difference; you'd be worse off almost whichever way using dollar-cost averaging I'd expect.

Well you don't get to decide how dollar-cost averaging is 'supposed' to work - that's just the way it does work. Deal with it.
BTW you sound upset bro

It's not an assumption; it's reflected in the exchange volumes, which have fallen 90%+ since the peak of the bubble

Most people use 'dollar-cost averaging' to rationalize their initial losses. They don't typically go in with a plan to buy $555 in December, and then $555 for each subsequent month for a year or longer.
Rather, how it went down for most people is that they bought into Bitcoin thinking they'd get rich quick, discovered the 20% drop wasn't in fact a 'brief correction', and so then pumped even more money in a desperate bid to avoid losses. Of course the problem with this plan is that you had to hope that the price was about to rise again. In all bubbles though, there is an extended downtrend period.
DCA seems rational at first glance, but it's actually a trap because initially you didn't have too much skin in the game, but now you're pretty much all-in.  You could have cut your losses for a mere $165, but instead now face a loss of $1781.
Another bad side effect of this (and something which eventually brings into effect the period of capitulation) is that you've maximized your opportunity cost. That money could have been in some other relatively secure investment earning you 5-10% a year. So not only are you chasing your losses, but you're also chasing lost opportunities and inflation. Over years, this has a compounding effect.

Even if you'd lost the entire $1005, that would be less than dollar-cost averaging and losing $1781.
One of the key points I'm making here is that dollar-cost averaging is digging a deeper hole for yourself. Chasing losses in this way is foolish.
I'll do the challenge you describe, which should only take a few minutes. I'll use the same dates/prices, but will make it $9045 ($1005 x 9 months).
EDIT: Alright, I did the calculation and here are the results - You end up buying 14.188 BTC for $9045. This is equivalent to $637.50/BTC, which would be a loss of $2269 (25.09%) using the current price of $485.
@_date: 2014-08-21 16:42:45


And the difference is negligible
One way your average price is $682.90, the other it's $637.50.
The point is that dollar-cost averaging is foolish, because you're just digging a deeper hole for yourself without mitigating any loss (in the example used, your %loss has doubled!)
BTW, thanks for the free money brah - keep it coming - it'll be added to [the wallet with all the other accumulated funds]( from the fools on this subreddit.
Back in June I jewed some schmuck on here out of ~$30 (0.06BTC) using alt accounts and different wallet addresses, because he was offering 0.01BTC to each person that would test it on his trading website. I could have kept going and got more (OP said he was giving away $500 worth of BTC), but I couldn't really be bothered and felt some pity towards him.
I've cashed out most of my Bitcoin for dollars (i.e. Bitcoin from mining on my HD7970), but I figure I may as well retain a small amount in the highly unlikely event I'm wrong, as [I do with all the other cryptocurrencies I mine]( - which of course I don't actually believe in.
Ironically if Bitcoin ever does become one of the biggest bubbles of all time, beyond the last one, it'll be people like you who have made me rich.
On the other hand, in the highly likely event I lose the $80 I can currently cash out for completely, I get to gloat over Bitcoin bagHODLers going broke and seeing their hopes and dreams crushed - all at the mere expense of pocket change that I got for free in the first place.
