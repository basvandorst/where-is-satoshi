Ah yeah that I didn't think of that.
Reading again that seems to be a property of shamirs algorithm that seems real important, that it doesn't give up any information without enough pieces.
Thank you so much for taking the time and educating! Fun to learn these things :)

I agree that you should protect yourself against both, just wanted to highlight that technology breakage is far more likely.
And reread my example, I'm not making a crypto it's simply split and you can reconstruct with 2 pieces. The order is not changed or anything.
I would be very interested in hearing how you do Shamir with seed words though?

The point is that you store them in three separate locations and can recover if you can get to two of them. I.e. your safe if your house burn down and you have the other parts at friends, family or any place _not_ your house. But if you loose one to a b&amp;e they won't have the key.
Anyway I thank you for the links, that does look a lot better and was incredibly interesting reads!
And yeah as I understand it the electrum issue is about slip39 which uses the secret sharing your refering too.
Great stuff!

Passphrase or split them up. Don't scramble, you are just making it more likely you'll loose the coins by inventing your own crypto

It is far more likely that your computer breaks and you need the seed, if your worried about B&amp;E either use a passphrase or simply split the seed words in three pieces and store them in three locations (A+B in one. B+C in one and A+C in the last). With these schemes you need to get two locations and/or know the passphrase to get to the coins.
