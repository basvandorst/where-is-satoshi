Thanks for the info.. I totally agree with your rant!!  So now the active trader requires a contact to customer service. So far no response.

Very unprofessional of Gemini not to give a heads up to their customers on the change.  No response to my request for active trader.  Maybe I don't qualify as one of their "select customers."

The way they did this roll out was unacceptable as far as I am concerned. They should have notified their customers and given us a chance to switch to active trader before they just shut you off from doing limit orders.  I am really annoyed. Still waiting on a response to change to active trader.

So now they do not allow limit buy order?? No notice of this?? WTF

I totally agree.  I am leaving this platform for sure.  They will be losing a lot of customers. I put in a request to become an active trader 10 hours ago. No response.  No notice of this change.  No more business from me.

Yes. I am  very annoyed. What is going on with Gemini?? I can no longer place limit sell orders.  Did we get notified of this change?
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:57:48
Yes, easy to submit a request but Gemini is not responding. It has been over 24 hours. So much for customer service.

I received the same notice.  You have to go to exchange settings on your profile. You should be able to click the active trader option.
