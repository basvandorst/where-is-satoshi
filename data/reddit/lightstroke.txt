You're lucky.

Or social media ...

This sounds exactly like what a friend of mine said about Amazon in the 90's, or what the same friend said about Netflix later. Or what so many used to say about Google ...

Yup. Nailed it. The shills are getting paid, Ver is dumping his BTC for BCH, Wu is moving his hash power, and they call this the "flippening."

Yes, my friend was sharp, arrogant, and absolutely convinced he was right ... kind of like you ...

It's hard for me to imagine that. Only thing that comes to mind is an image of Gollum ...

Your argument is like saying if someone pulls a gun on you and says, "give me your phone," you're free to say "no thanks," therefore there is no problem and your freedom isn't being violated.

Not only did they admit to lying, but they go into detail of why they lied -- the film makers were **paying** them. The juicier the story they could concoct, the more they got paid. On top of that, the film makers decieved some of them to trick them into giving interviews. 
Bottom line: who knows WTF happened, the production of the documentary looks as shady as McAfee himself.

That's because this is an etrade commercial ...

Yeah, but for how much longer? My guess is sometime this century we will have the tech to make gold.

I'm curious, what made you so confident that you were being reasonable in being deluded ... ?
Anti-FUDsters have become just as bad as FUDsters.
