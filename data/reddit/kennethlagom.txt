bruh i fix laptops and desktop dont mine with a loptop trust me reason one i have litterally fried my laptop and the fix was to change processor but its integrated to motherboard of laptop and not replaceble and now i now cant work on graphics of the laptop its just overheats .and 2 reason i know the prices of spares and laptop graphics prices are like 5 times  the destop spare price and more to it the replacement is little pricey as graphics can only be replaced with a bga machine .all i have to say is think it once more

yeah sure its energy efficient like hash rate equivalent to 15* 1080 right and bitmain says 300 watts mosty acurate on their numbers. so so if there is no fork yeah definately consumes less juice compared to 15 *1080 together need only a small place and bro vosk coin youtube has an accurate vedio on this bitmain z9 if bitmain is  sure that there is no fork comming soon they might increase the price of the miner like they did for the eth asic
 Hashing algorithm: Equihash
    Power consumption: 300W
    Hashrate: 10k Sol/s ± 5%' and a single gtx 1080consumes 250 watts and lets add lets add 30 watts for other computer equipments thats 30 watts + 15 1080 ti multiplied by 250 watts  its 3750 watts and compare the 300 watts asic 12 times energy efficient than rigs of z cash gpu rigs

but less chances bro now bit coin is now a big network because of asic and bch is emerging too so i think eth is chasing bch to gain the position and the fact is that only few coin developers stick to their  words they just want gpu miners at starting the network.and  when it stands on their own they just move on. but am happy monero stood against it .but bit main is on head to head with nvidia .heard rumors that nvidia made more than bitmain with selling so thats  a big threat to bitmains s9 that might be the reason they dropped asics for altcoins so no one would go to gpus. thanks bruh i appretiate it for reaching out
