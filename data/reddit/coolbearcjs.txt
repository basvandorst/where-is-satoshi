We have delivered over 7,000 raffle prizes to our fans. Many of which you can see on our fan page. With many 5 star reviews in the app store there is nothing sketchy about our raffles.

You mean you tried to raise 1.5MM to buy out your partners and after finding  your mobile app had security issues and people having access to hands which I told you about and did nothing. Yeah I am sure you run a fair poker app where it is all on the up and up Bryan.

First of all I am Chris Sweis and this guy Tom is way out of line. I guess it is easy to post anything and it can be considered true yet this is far from the truth. He starts out saying he got all his rewards till now and that is true we have rewarded over $3.9MM worth of gift cards and prizes to over 3.4MM loyal users. He threatened to bad mouth us and was banned a long time ago from our internal team so yes we banned him for good today. It is hard to see so many in the Bitcoin community believe this garbage and even tip him when he has gotten everything and then some. I am known in the community and am sure there are many who know me that will vouch for mine and our character. 
This is not an issue that deserves this much attention yet he has gotten his Bitcoins to the address provided. Now he thinks he can double dip and that is not happening here. Look at his twitter account and personality type and you will see someone who is looking for anything free and then some. 
I thank Kevin and Charlie for making me aware of this discussion.  If I was not watching planet of the Apes which was a good movie by the way I would have responded sooner. 
Tom or whatever your real name is just move on with your life. Getting rewarded from our apps will not crush you. Nor should you feel bad. You will be fine.

I expect you will see DraftKings be the first to experiment with Bitcoin and expect them to do it soon...Also, I have heard that the team at Airbitz is doing something in this space to make it possible to use bitcoin on DraftKings...I am sure this will play out soon...
