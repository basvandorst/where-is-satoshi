I think they are asking for information on why you chose that as an analogy to the paradigm shift. I thought the same thing; you kind of lost me there.

I'm actually surprised at the buy price OP is getting vs the market price. I just checked again to make sure it wasn't a fluke the past few days. 
My buy price is $12 over the rate on the exchange. 
My sell price is $12 under current price. 
This is all before the 1.5% fee, which I thought was still reasonable after the increase.

No problem. I'm glad to help. Honestly I'm not an authority on security, but I don't think I would be comfortable keeping very large amounts of bitcoin on a blockchain.info wallet. I'm still playing around with their wallet right now, but for convenience and daily use it looks really cool.
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:14:32
Phones are pretty good for security for a lot of reasons but you'll want to keep your seed backed up somewhere safe(secure, in case you lose your device).
I just messed around with Blockchain wallet some and it looks like they've made it pretty secure now. I would definitely enable 2 Factor Authentication if I were using it.

Thanks for the clarification on bc.i. 
How do you feel about them as a secure wallet for holding larger amounts? Playing with their wallet briefly I could only find the option to copy down my seed phrase from the website. They claim they never see your private key, so I'm wondering where the wallet actually is if I just had to sign up and could access the seed.

We could do that with current technology, but requiring a full data center to be a node goes against the whole idea of Bitcoin. 
The quickest way to scale on chain transactions would be to increase the block size limit, but even the proposal of an increase from 1MB to 2MB is still an ongoing debate that has caused a lot of division among the community. And that was only proposed as a quick solution to scale a very amount.

Bitstamp ate the loss. It was about $5 million from their hot wallet at that time. Bitfinex just said they didn't use cold storage and confirmed over 119,000 coins were stolen.
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:16:58
Was the amount for over $10,000USD? They have to following banking laws that require additional recording of transactions starting at that amount. 
This has been asked here before and I believe this was the reason a few times, others not. I've never gotten it for any small or large(still under 10k) transactions.

How much would shipping to the US be? I was so excited to get my Nano S as soon as possible and missed out on the  great customization option.
Thanks for the great product either way. Years of paranoia regarding the fear of my bitcoins disappearing every time I opened my wallet have ended and love the product so far.

No dumb questions when it comes to learning how to protect your investments. 
Although I'm not an expert, looking at the Xapo website, it looks like they control the private keys which means that they are holding the coins for you and you are trusting them with their security.
As for Blockchain.info, I've been around long enough to remember when people were constantly losing their coins because of their lax security and email phishing scams. But with them, you do control the private keys and therefore have complete control over them, as long as they are never revealed when interfacing with the website(a weak point in their security).
Choosing what wallet you use really depends on how you'll be using it and how much time/money you want to invest into securing your coins. If you want to have access on a mobile device Breadwallet and Mycellium have been great for me. For the most part I've used Electrum for PC and it's been great, but you still have to practice good security if it's on an internet connected computer that you frequently use.
If you're serious about locking them down and can make the investment, see the other posts about hardware wallets.
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:22:31
That's correct. You can restore the wallet on a new device using your seed.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:35:25
Bitfinex's position is that only individual user bitcoin addresses were stolen from and that fiat and ether are safe.
Unfortunately I don't see how a loss this large won't force them into bankruptcy, leading to a long process of all assets being distributed across all users.
@_date: 2014-10-31 15:34:31
Still less than keeping it all in your wallet. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 22:25:17
What about using bread wallet on an offline, unused iPhone with the seed phrase written down as a back up in case of hardware failure or theft?
Follow-up: What if the breadwallet app dropped off of the App Store and ceased development years later and all you had for recovery was the seed phrase?
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:17:51
This. There will be a run because they never made their reserves public and still haven't so the fear of a run feeds itself to a reality. I wasn't going to sit around and find out if the last 50% of users didn't get their withdrawals. 
That being said, the new implementations look awesome and I hope they remain very successful. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:52:08
Withdrawal went through in less than 5 minutes and is on the network. 
Edit: Second withdrawal took about twice as long, but I've been made whole.
I appreciate all the hard work they went through and the new features that have been added, but I hope they understand if I watch from the sidelines for a while.

Happened to me. Looks like a bug they are working on.
@_date: 2016-06-13 22:01:29
My account just went into negative balance just now also. I'm assuming a glitch and am about to open a support ticket. With all the volume lately, I was worried in the back of my mind that a purchase would be cancelled, but sending my account into negative balance doesn't make any sense. Will update when I have more info.
edit: Looks like this is happening to many customers and they just posted this( regarding the issue. Hopefully every thing is fine.

Wow. Thank you so much for the reply and the info. I'm on mobile and find the company right now, but I actually uploaded the Coinbase reports to a "Bitcoin tax company," and without taking time to alter the original document I was told that I owed some pretty strange amounts. 
Like I mentioned above, many of my coins wouldn't even be subject to capital gains taxes due to holding them for over a year, but my reports were filled with wallet to wallet transactions as well as fiat to BTC transactions. I'll need to read the CB article further and try to compare it to the IRS' stance, but I was under the impression that they were treating any movement of coins as a financial transaction, and given recent heavy handed event towards CB it isn't too comforting. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 02:46:28
They only way I heard about it is I noticed it on their website header. I went to check it out but it looked like it was only for very high net worth investors. I signed up and everything but I didn't even get a thank you email.
Maybe there was a glitch and you'll end up a rich angel investor.

I bought a Ledger Nano S for my cold storage. A bit cheaper than Trezor and set up is very easy, it's very secure, and I'm finally able to not constantly worry about security every day.
@_date: 2016-06-13 22:59:31
Thanks for super quick response! I got a bit anxious when my account suddenly told me I owed you a lot of money.
@_date: 2017-01-24 19:27:30
Even ones kicked around from my phone, between electrum wallets and my Cold Storage? Because that was the impression I got. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 02:23:31
It's already worse than that. I was making a career move and thought I might have to sell a few coins for bills during the time, so I exported all my U. S. regulated info and thought I would figure out any capital gains taxes. I exported my data from Coinbase, Circle, and others and it's such a clusterfuck. 
I'm sure a lot of people are already aware, but just moving your coins from somewhere like Coinbase to my cold storage (or any simple transaction for that matter e.g. Moving funds between your own wallet addresses) are considered a taxable transaction in the eyes of the IRS.
Thankfully I haven't have to sell any yet but I'd hate having to find a CPA who could make sense of my Bitcoin movements, but would have a good time if the IRS tried to come audit my history and make sense of it while I've got the extra time to spare at home.
If I do decide to sell any coins there's a whole shitty aspect of trying to prove what I'm selling are coins that haven't been used for years and are therefore exempt from capital gains taxes.
As you said, I wish I had just bought and sold all my coins outside the system, but I'm way too lazy for that and it's an albatross around my neck now if I do ever sell them.

I've been running a full node on and off for the past few years, but recently I set up a home server and figured I would run a 24/7 node on it while I'm at it. I'm wanting to learn Linux so I've set up a VM running Core on my server. I opened port 8333(on my server and VM) and Core says I have 8 peers connected, but when I try to check if I'm on the network via 21.co it says I'm not. 
Any advice for an amateur on if I'm actually a useful node or how to become one running a node on VM?
@_date: 2016-12-07 01:55:12
This is awesome! Thanks for taking the time to help me out. I thought my node being on a VM might be causing it not to show up on the network so I went ahead and set up a dedicated server that will soon be running along side the VM wallet. Thanks for the tip on upload bandwidth. I have 25 up, but actually use a lot of it 24/7 so it would definitely be a concern. Unfortunately my CLI knowledge is near zero so I imagine I'll spend my night trying to run daemon combined with a lot of frustration.

Consider it a high risk investment. When I started buying large amounts it was because of the fear of missing out. As my $800 coins fell to under $300, I ended up selling most of them. 
But along the way I started learning more about how it works, becoming involved in the community, interested in Bitcoin's possibilities for society, and started buying again because I believed in Bitcoin as something more than an investment.
That being said I spent the past two years buying here and there and it's turned out pretty well as an investment also. I believe it's stickied on the sub but remember, DON'T BUY MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE. 
The market it pretty wild right now, but every hodler here is proof that time in the market beats timing the market everyday, if you decide to buy some. Good luck!
@_date: 2016-12-06 18:39:56
I'd actually be happy to go back and open some sell positions to help the environment! I wish nothing but the best for projects like this that I hope are the future. 
IIRC isn't the sell price set and fixed once placed? I seem to remember placing sells at the current market price and shortly after the BTC price took a large dip, leaving my sell price at way over market price. I know this is exactly how exchanges like Bitstamp work, but with them there was zero penalty for canceling a sell and re-issuing it at the new market price.

I started setting up three nodes this past week and was convinced that there was something I was doing wrong. I had heard of bootstrapping to speed up the process but I was in no hurry, but it took days to get my main node caught up. The other two boxes I've shelved for now because they are just clutter syncing even slower than my first node. 
I've got the hardware and bandwidth to help out the network, but it can't be this long to set up a full node from scratch every time can it?
Can you install and increase the max connection over 8 in the conf file?

I used to use Coinbase for purchases(fiat to btc, slow) and Bitstamp for trading(trying to make a profit, extremely fast). 
Whenever Coinbase increased their fee and started selling btc at almost 5% over their own listed market price I finally left them and tried to give this Bitsquare, that basically feels like spam on this sub at this point, a shot. I'm a US customer, and as you said the USD isn't so great right now, but is there any at all? I loved the idea so I tried both buying and selling but after a month of trying it I had no successful transactions. It seemed the only option to buy in USD was via bank wire but I couldn't even get that to work and my buys would always end in arbitration explaining that even trying to make s manual wire transfer wasn't possible. My two attempts at selling just stayed open for about a week each until I canceled them and ate the fee.
It may be my lack of understanding on how the platform works, but the user experience left someone at my technical level(low, but well above many CB and Bitstamp users) feeling like it was unfinished software or the system didn't work from start to finish.

Could you educate me on how a DDoS attack increases in cost for the actual attacker as the victim's bandwidth is increased?
I could understand if the attacker is using solely their resources for the attack, but in the case of a botnet aren't they limited to a capacity depending on the size of their botnet and bots are essentially hijacked clients who are unknowingly having their resources used on the attacker's behalf?

Is Arch really a good way for a beginner to learn Linux? I started with Mint(17.3 Rosa) to have a comfy GUI while learning bash/terminal. Learn Linux the Hard Way(the site and the methodology) seems to be a very popular recommendation. 
Would a complete noob be able to set up Arch on a factory laptop with all the OEM hardware?

Just bought some more on Coinbase today and it was still 1%. 
Going through the KYC hurdles was such a pain when I signed up with them that it's kept me from completely leaving. I guess today my laziness found it's bounds.
