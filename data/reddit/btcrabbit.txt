Exactly- I'm trying to get it out there right now to see if people will slowely start to join up.

Thanks! Yes I know Bitcoin.travel but I was thinking of something specialised only for real estate. 9Flats is very cool as well, but AirBnb is also not exactly what I'm going after. I was looking to make something where people can have longer relationships (hence the roommate idea) or buy/sell property.

Looks great! I just signed up to test it. Love it!

I've started a service that's similar, that allows you to list your own place that you want to sell/rent and for which you'd take bitcoins. It's like a real estate finder service, but for bitcoin. Http://

It's a shame really. The foundation needs new leadership.

Although I should mention that I started it just today- so not many places are listed yet. But I'm hoping to attract people!

Good response I think. I too help Bitcoinica funds, yet I have reacted with suspicion towards the liquidator. I think caution is in order, and for the moment I'm not interested in any time being diverted for bitcoinica away from the core issue of fixing the exchange.

This is happening again right now. It's been over an hour. Especially during a time of panic. Not good.

Thanks for the info- there must be something wrong with the London Ad that it doesn't show. I'll check it out, thanks!

This is a new site I've put up to reach people who are interested in buying/selling/renting property for Bitcoin. If you've got a spare room you're looking to rent for Bitcoin or a house you want to sell for bitcoin, Bitcoinroommate.com is the place!

Hey guys- why don't you just find a way to "slow" down the market. IE only allow a few trades per second and randomly assign who gets their order in that second completed. Just as a measure to slow things down.

Disable the API trading until you have worked the kinks out. And are positive things works. API trading if for more institutional type investors, and to be honest- we aren't there yet with your infrastructure. Force people to click the buttons and set their orders manually. Use a CAPTCHA if necessary. 
This way the market doesn't grind to a halt, people can still trade, and those large investors can still trade too- albeit they won't profit as much from the current infrastructure failure.

More then that- it's an investment. It's been like what- a week? Investments normally take time to mature in their value. I hope you at least buy back in at some point.

Thanks! Yes I do have quite a bit of work to do. I can't seem to replicate the zooming into the middle of the ocean problem. What device/browser are you two using? Do you have any location enabling services that are turned on/off? Are you on a VPN? It's supposed to 'guess' where you are currently located and open already centered around that spot. Any info about your setup would be appreciated!

Very cool, but Africa is very rapidly leaving feature phones behind. Indeed- smartphone adoption in Africa is skyrocketing.
