I'm playing the long game. Bitcoin is amazing technology with rock solid proof of work. It'll be around 100 years from now.

I'm so sick of the Chinese government causing problems for everyone else, especially when you *know* the corrupt leaders own tons of BTC themselves.

Yeah, I wrote that. I was using a Trezor, though, which doesn’t wipe itself after too many incorrect PIN attempts. I got lucky because a kid wrote exploit firmware for me. Good luck!

If you really want to torture yourself, look at GDAX and watch the price change every second.

There has never been anything like Bitcoin in history. We are barely at the beginning of the beginning of it. This FUD dip means nothing. Hodl.

About the same amount as when I wrote this:

I don’t know, sorry!

I have a Trezor and my housekeeper threw away the piece of paper that had my 24 word key and PIN code on it (yep, I'm an idiot). I can't remember my PIN code and thanks to the PIN delay, I'm can't keep trying to guess it. I bought the Trezor in January and haven't updated it. I have a few bitcoin on it, so I am eager to figure out how to get my PIN code. But Doshay Zero404Cool's Medium article is short on details. I don't know what to to with the bin file download. Am I supposed to flash the Trezor with it? I think that would probably wipe the memory on the Trezor, since I suspect it doesn't like unsigned firmware.

Sorry for the misleading headline. I misunderstood.

Don’t do what I did:

Here's a 3D model I modified that could also come in handy:

You're right. I should have said "price."

We should close the markets and just have your set the prices, since you know what bitcoin is going to do.

I messed around with them enough that it will be a good challenge for someone with the chops to figure it out.
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:10:40
If you were looking at Saleem's instructional video, then that makes sense. He was showing me how to do it. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:55:49
I may be a loser but I paid Saleem. What gave you the idea that I didn't?
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:35:46
I wrote the article. It was a little over $400/BTC at the time.
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:44:02
I paid Saleem! Worth every satoshi.
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:30:47
I did try it. The story was getting to be too long, so I didn't include it!
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:32:03
Bought at $405, playing the long game.
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:37:52
At Saleem's request, I deleted exploit.bin. I paid him for one-time use.

Author of the article here. When is the last time you updated the software on the Trezor? If it's before 1.5.2 and you didn't add a passphrase, you can get it back. Send me a direct message and I can help point you in the right direction.
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:54:58
I started to do that, but BTC was getting too expensive. But I had barely enough to pay Saleem.
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:55:29
I'm still using Trezor. And I've used Andreas Antonopoulos' advice to not lose my PIN or seed again. (I don't want to say exactly what I did)
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:32:07
The numbers were familiar, but I was surprised I put them in that order. The part of my brain that had the number stored was fried from overthinking
@_date: 2019-05-11 20:36:35
I think TA is generally pretty useless and in the case of bitcoin utterly useless.
