Upboats for you. 
Why didn't Simon post this message earlier? I'm pretty sure a lot of people would have settle down if they would of seen this earlier rather than the "Site is not available message". I feel a lot better seeing this message rather than staying out of the loop for several hours.

Hopefully you can get it back since you never got to spend it on anything. I'm sent them an email to reverse my SEPA transfer here's to luck...

I'm in the same boat too. Sent money to them via SEPA my bank said it was sent successfully to them... Is it possible to reverse a SEPA transaction?

What about money sent to your Commerzbank account? I sent hundreds of Euros the day before the site shutdown. Can you start reimbursing people who deposited the day before/day site went down?

Thanks for the info I actually sent it to their Commerzbank German account. Hopefully that account never got frozen. I just want my money back that I sent to them since I never got to buy Bitcoins with it.

He's not running away. Give him some time to sort out the issues. He posted a message on his website that he's working on it.
