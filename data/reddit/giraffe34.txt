You got scammed? What do you mean?
I've used faucets several times, and I have never been scammed. Here's proof:

You're welcome.
I definitely understand your skepticism about bitcoin faucets. Bitcoin faucets run off of donations, and give out very tiny amounts of btc.

I live in KC... Nobody is cool enough here to know about bitcoins, unfortunately.

I would suggest buying bitcoins through coinbase with your bank account. There are some fees, but it's not too big of a deal. 
If you plan on buying anything illegal, please use bitcoin fog. Bitcoin isn't as private as you may think it is.

You have to reach 0.00005500btc on coinbox for it to payout.
