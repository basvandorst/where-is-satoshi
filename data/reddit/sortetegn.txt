Limit order is you placing an order, and someone else buying it. Market order is you buying an order that someone else placed.

Not at all, you need to have your BTC stored in a wallet (Bitcoin Core, Electrum, Mycelium, hardware wallets, paper wallets ect.) *before* block  is mined (before the 25th).

Worth mentioning though that Kraken charges 0.16%/0.25% makers/takers fee, whereas GDAX charges 0.00%/0.25%. Not much in either case, it does however become noticable if you ever get into daytrading

Velkommen! :)  SEPA DKK/EUR bank transfer to Coinbase (20,- DKK fee, ~2 days transfer time), then move EUR to GDAX and buy BTC using limit order (no fee, instant transfer, instant buy).

You're welcome,
Been into crypto for a few months, long enough to get burned on downgoing market trends and making stupid investments in stillborn/plunging ICOs &amp; altcoins, but still managing a maginal profit thanks to BTC/ETH. Abit of advice: You're most likely at making a profit by long-term investing in BTC/ETH, *Moonhunting* is a fools game.

The oktober fork will result in all BTC stored in (most) wallets at the end of block  
to also appear as BTG on the new BitCoinGold-branch blockchain. Whichever Bitcoin version becomes the dominant, you'll have ~~it~~ either, as long as you control the cryptographic private key to your wallet. Check the official BTG webpage for more info on which wallets are compatible with the fork
