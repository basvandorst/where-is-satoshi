Forgive me if this has been posted somewhere but I’ve been curious, are their any implications for crypto in general if net neutrality falls?

He fact that there is 2.3 acres for sale in North Park is crazy. That area is so densely populated now.

Ahh I’m on an iPhone that’s why I don’t see it.

Thanks for this! As to a good space for it I have that. Separate climate controlled room and my power is included in my rent. I’m looking into all my options now.

I still legitimately don’t understand differences in mining rigs and how it works otherwise I would, electricity is included in my rent but I can’t for the life of me comprehend the equipment.

Which mobile wallet do you recommend? You said bread wallet isn’t safe but it’s one of the 6.

Thanks! I honestly expected to get flamed. I looked into the antminer s9 a while back but there was some sort of issue I don’t remember. I think it was shipping time. Is there a site to order from that you recommend? Also, where is best place for me to read up on which pool to choose? I’ve been hodling for a few years but haven’t ever mined. Would love to start. Sorry for all the questions, I’m pretty good at researching myself but with btc I don’t know what I can completely trust when reading up.

Not a bad idea, I will see if I have something comparable lying around. I live in Florida, not many heaters here. I know I definitely don’t have one. What are your thoughts on running it off my normal PC and doing “cloud mining?” Or correct my terminology if it’s wrong.

Are the PSUs specific to say Antminer s9? Or will a standard ATX 1200 run it? And do you set up a case and such? Or just set them on a desk?
