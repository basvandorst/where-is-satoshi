Nah you earn it. They calculate the amount you get based on you top 35 years of taxable income. They then use a formula using the sum total to determine how much you will actually receive monthly.
Now I agree that this money isn't as secure as your IRA though, since Congress can choose to @ the payout or calculations at their discretion.

When I see a statement like this it usually makes me think it's been written by an individual who is completely new to investing. 
Thoroughly researching an asset, perceiving it may have long term value and buying a reasonable allocation in a diversified set of investments is not hoping for a miracle. That's making a calculated bet on the success of an asset.  
I'll take that any day of the week over staring at support and resistance lines and getting chopped up by bigger and better players than yourself. Doubly so in bitcoin, where the small size of the asset makes it far easier to manipulate.

Schnorr and Taproot will address a lot of privacy concerns. With that being said I do agree there are things that Bitcoin is not willing to implement that will be valuable to people, and as a result some alts will survive and thrive

I get you. I could see it as both a short term payment solution and bitcoin training wheels for newer users until wallets and second layers mature to allow joe shmoe to use them seamlessly.

To store value im totally with you, but let's be realists here, to have people spend that value on a larger scale I don't think it's unfair to say that BTC isn't ready for prime time. That's fine, obviously solutions for scaling are being developed and tested, but for day to day transactions we may very well benefit from these middlemen in the medium term.
It's something that goes against the very core ideals of the BTC community though, it'll be interesting to see how widely accepted that kind of service becomes.
@_date: 2018-08-05 04:40:20


they almost certainly will, you're not wrong. I doubt a middleman would allow you send bitcoin to a wallet with known criminal ties or to a sanctioned nation state, but that's also where real on chain or second layer transactions could take over. Slower, but far more flexible and free.

I agree with you in principle, but if we want to stay steadfast to those principles in the medium term I think we have to be comfortable with further adoption waiting a few more years for the maturation of layer 2.
Since I don't believe for a second most businesses would ever hold their own crypto, I think this kind of custodial and payment solution is a necessary one to be a built anyway, and might be a good stepping stone for a lot of people coming from a traditional banking environment to get them more comfortable with treating bitcoin as a currency and payment option, while still having the "security" that they're used to.

...i'm sorry to be rude, but for retirement funds there are really only a handful of choices for most people. Cash, Bonds, REIT's, or stocks in the form of individual stocks, mutual funds, or etf's. Most people end up choosing (or the choice is made for them by their employer if they make no election) to go into an investment that is basically an amalgam of bonds and stocks. 
No matter how many times you say something like "which most everyday people do not participate in" it does not, in fact, make it true. Most full time, working people in 1st world countries either have a pension (which your employer will invest in a set of stocks, bonds and real estate) or a self directed retirement account.


Everything in life is gambling. Some things you have more control over than others, but let's not kid ourselves here, we all do plenty of things on a daily basis that we have little power over. Nothing in life is a guarantee, but more a series of (hopefully) reasoned, calculated gambles.
You ever get married? That was a gamble, could have ended badly for you. You ever had children? That was a gamble, they could have been born with some horrible disease. You have abilities to try and mitigate risk, but the risk is ever present. 
If you don't like investing that's fine, but get your facts straight. As an aside I also hope that you understand that any money you are saving today is going to get eaten alive by inflation in a 20-30 year timeframe, I hope you're accounting for that in your retirement planning. 
Edit: Also I just have to ask, you are on a bitcoin subreddit, presumably have some amount of bitcoin in your possession, but you're calling STOCK ownership gambling?
@_date: 2018-06-25 20:32:24


Do you have a retirement account at work, or an IRA? Unless you foolishly have those in pure bonds or cash, you probably own stocks. So do most working adults with income.

While I won't disagree that security is  I think a large portion of the reason why technology hasn't been a huge factor in the discussion is ethereum is in the middle of their development cycle on their next updates, so there hasn't been anything really new to discuss as of late. We'll see those discussions re-emerge later this year when plasma releases, and then another calm for a year until sharding gets closer to reality.

@_date: 2018-07-08 17:59:07


I'm not totally following you on this one. If a company convinces enough validators to fork then so be it, that's how the market works in all properly decentralized cryptocurrencies. I don't entirely know why they WOULD do that, but it's theoretically possible. Theoretically possible on bitcoin too, I might add.


Vitalik is definitely the poster boy of ethereum atm, but the project would in fact continue running without him. His word carries a lot of weight, but he doesn't have any special powers beyond that. The longer the project exists and the more of a life it takes of its own, the less control he has. 
If something bad were to happen to him today would it shake confidence in the project? Probably briefly, until developers showed continued progress in development.
I will also note that bitcoin has prominent, important developers working on protocal upgrades, like Schnorr. If a few of those people were kidnapped I have no doubt development would be impeded and the price would drop. Yet it doesn't really happen, or at least hasn't yet.

as long as they're willing to hold in the long term they're probably fine, but there is no guarantee this is the start of stabilization or a new run.
