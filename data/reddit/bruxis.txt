I'm pretty sure he's referring to the amount of funds tied up in the LN at the moment. If you can hack it, you get the funds.
(though this statement is probably largely false as I'm sure you'd need a node somewhere in the midst of those transactions to really get an opportunity)

The fees in Bitcoin are based on the size of your transaction. The bigger the transaction, the bigger the fees. The size of your transaction is based on (1) whether or not you're sending from a segwit wallet, and (2) how many inputs you're using to send said amount.
An example for 
- If you cost averaged your investment over 10 weeks at 0.01 BTC per week, you would have 10 inputs
- Now if you want to send 0.035 BTC to another address, you'll have 5 outputs (4 + change address)
This is why it varies from person to person.

BCH would be faster because you're pretty much guaranteed to be in the next block with an average fee, whereas with BTC  you may not be for some # of blocks (if fees skyrocket while you're in queue, could be days as shown in recent history). If BCH had BTC's current traffic, with no other changes to the network, it still means you'd be 8x more likely to be in the next block -- though the current traffic wouldn't likely cause a mempool backlog on that network.
I think generally the speed point made though is that BCH does not have Replace-by-Fee (RBF), which can provide the appearance that 0-conf transactions more trustworthy. Technically in BTC, RBF is an opt-in flag intended to highlight a transaction as potentially more fraudulent, but it's still quite easy to double-spend a transaction on BTC with the current mempool backlog situation, even without marking a tx as RBF.
Re. ^1: BCH has lower fees than LTC, but LTC has 4x the block speed, so you'll get your first confirmation faster. There are people on both sides of the block speed discussion, one saying that faster is better, and the other side saying that 1 confirmation on LTC's network is only "1/4th" as trustworthy as 1 confirmation on a Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:56:55
Yeah, so if I'm following OP's logic here...
- $20 to open, $20 to close = $40 fees
- 1 LN tx, ignoring small fee = 1 tx (of value) - $40 fees, $40/tx
- 2 LN tx, ignoring small fees = ~$40 fees, $20/tx
- 3 LN tx, ignoring small fees = ~$40 fees, $13/tx
- 4 LN tx, ignoring small fees = ~$40 fees, $10/tx
- 5 LN tx, ignoring small fees = ~$40 fees, $8/tx
- 6 LN tx, ignoring small fees = ~$40 fees, $6.67/tx
- [...]
- 80 LN tx, ignoring small LN fees = 80 tx (of value) - ~$40 fees total, $0.50/tx
So... I have to make upwards of 80 transactions through my initially funded LN to make my individual transaction fee average be around half a dollar (which is still too high for small transactions, such as coffee).
(for the record, 800 transactions would get this down to 5 cents per transaction, which is still fairly steep for small purchases)
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:50:53
Since LN is designed for use for microtransactions, seems like it would be pretty simple to DDoS and monopolize these hubs processing time/bandwidth via simply constructed channels that must traverse a hub. 
Is there a solution in place for that?

FYI: You don't really need to store the entire blockchain to operate a full node or a mining node. It does need to be accessible by _some_ nodes to propagate to new nodes, but once you've started a node you can simply build the UTXO and prune your chain.
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:13:50
Yeah, was going to post this. This actually means "Bcash" can have a fee market that is based on priority, not skyrocketing fees. Low priority (ie. dust gathering) fees can be 0-1 sat/b while others can be 2, 3 sat/b which is still cheap.

Technically, Bitcoin Core is intended to be a reference implementation of a client for the Bitcoin protocol. It's in the currency's best interest to note this and actually respect that this client is _not_ Bitcoin itself.

Minor (?) correction: LN does _not_ use "Tor routing", it will use "onion routing" which only implies that a node supposedly can only see the immediate addresses of the node the tx routed from, to where it's going to route it to.
That said, this selling point isn't particularly accurate at this point in time since the entire network topology is used to determine routing -- making privacy very lacking.
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:40:34
It will depend on the nodes you're connecting with, they may have a varying number required. I imagine some nodes will want up to 6 confirmations (a la exchanges).
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:00:30
From what I read, it was BitGo consolidating a bunch of dust they had collected at a slightly higher-than-needed fee rate, causing their SegWit transactions to receive priority and be pushed pretty hard until the batch was completely processed.

It depends on the number of inputs. If you've been accumulating Bitcoin in your wallet through multiple purchases over time, you'll likely have a large number of inputs, making the transaction quite large (in bytes). This is why many people say their fees are high and others call shenanigans. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:47:33
Certainly, but until on-chain costs go down dramatically (open, closing a channel), people will be incentivized to open a channel through most optimal route available and leave it open. I'm sure there will be websites/apps detailing which node to connect to for the least cost/tx. Those nodes will be hubs.
As those nodes see more and more connections, they will need to effectively become service providers at their own cost. This may lead to higher tx fees for those nodes. This may cause them to go lower on the list, but all top nodes may face this cycle of adoption - tx fee increase - lower ranking - rinse &amp; repeat. It will be interesting to see how this plays out in practice.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:17:12
There's an issue with Bread where it will keep transmitting the transaction. You can uninstall the app and reinstall it, if your transaction has been abandoned by the mempool, you'll have the funds returned already.
You don't even need to re-enter your wallet seed when you do this, but you should have it written down regardless.

@_date: 2017-12-16 16:44:47
And so far LN has shown no value because it's not in use, and Litecoin doesn't even "need" it yet because it doesn't have enough traffic.
If block times being 4x as often were an important metric to people in this sub, Bitcoin should arguably reduce them as well, right? Since that isn't being proposed here, let's assume that's off the table for making LTC "better".
Wider acceptance on exchanges? Because Coinbase has it? -- If that's your point, this is likely to be a balanced inequality in a few weeks. Regardless, does LTC have any LTC/&lt;*altcoin&gt; pairings on any exchange? No.

You don't seem to know what you're talking about, besides what you've read here.
- The Bitcoin.com wallet makes a BCH and BTC wallet, with the same receiving address -- this is _good_ because if someone sends you the wrong currency, you can still receive it and send it back, for them to give you the correct one (it's not just lost to the void)
- The Bitcoin.com site _currently_ is still 99% about BTC. There certainly is a slow amount of BCH creeping into it, but up until this point, there's nothing to complain about.

This is correct, the Trezor has been proven to have security flaws on multiple occasions purely via hardware attack vectors.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:53:53
I wonder how realistic that is though..
If it's truly decentralized, and there are _tons_ of LN nodes, and each transaction has very small fees (which is the goal), it seems like the reward for simply running the node would not pay for the electricity of leaving a computer running at idle usage...
That aside, LN transactions are meant to be routed through multiple nodes, so I wonder who would receive that small fee. If it were the routing head (first stop), then the common tail nodes would not be incentivized. If it were the tail nodes, then the common head nodes would not be incentivized (think Tor network nodes: in-&gt;mix-&gt;out stages). If it's split between all nodes routed through, then it's also such a small fee that it's unlikely to be worth it for most users.
Not to mention routing itself seems to be an NP-hard problem, as it aligns closely to the travelling salesman example problem (
... I'm hoping for the best here, but I have some extreme doubts about the viability of LN on all sides

That's a tricky question... it's only in recent history that fees have spiked this much. Generally speaking, the advice is to always have your coins in a wallet you control. This originally was purely for sake of security, but recently we've also discovered that this is important for ensuring that you have access to upcoming forks/airdrops.
I think the answer to your question depends on how you intend to use your coins, and under what circumstances you will be concerned enough to want to sell them ASAP. One of the biggest problems at the moment is, in the case of a rush-to-the-exit scenario, even a high fee (say 950 sats above) _could_ get pushed down to be considered a _low fee_ with enough people rushing for the door. In fact, this is to some extent, what we're seeing with the current fee situation.
For the time being, I'd still recommend having them in your own wallet, but as soon as the mempool dies down (hopefully it eventually will), you should consolidate your inputs. To do this, you would send your total BTC amount to yourself with a low fee. Even at 10 inputs, if your fee is 50sats/byte, you'll be doing pretty good for a consolidation. This will help you in the scenario you do need an escape route in the future, since that transaction cost will be much lower (potentially 1 input vs. 10, the largest part of the transaction size).
Hope that helps!

Fast enough for what? The largest portion of time spent before the next block is propagated is the actual mining (to calculate a 'winning' hash), not block propagation over the network itself. Most miners begin mining as soon as they receive the headers, not even waiting for witness data (since the risk is _low_ of an invalid block).
Certainly, there's a _very small_ chance that multiple miners could find themselves competing over this speed, but it's ridiculously small and only gets smaller with more miners (and in turn, more difficulty for the hash).

Possibly true, but also very risky prospect from a business perspective. Most businesses don't want to bank on the "what if" scenario (this is why Amazon doesn't take Bitcoin).

Why do you _need_ to run a full node? This comes up a lot here, and nobody seems to understand the true value of running a node. 
Quick Answer: Non-mining nodes only propagate information, they do not do validating. They follow whichever chain they believe to be correct, which _may in fact no longer be the main chain_.
Here's some quotes from good old Sat. Nakamoto himself regarding how most full nodes will be miners, and those miners will be server farms ("centralization"):
-  (server farms)
-  (big wallet files)
-  (SPV nodes, users not running full nodes)

An upgrade 'fork' does not necessarily require a chain split. Segwit2X was contentious due to it's proponents, meaning that it was pushed out into it's own coin proposal.
If the "Bitcoin Core" development team implemented a block size increase, it would be adopted without issue and only be seen as an upgrade to the network (ETH had a similar upgrade recently).

In order to consolidate your transactions, you have to send your outputs (10 previous inputs) to yourself. This will save money in the _future_, but this transaction still costs you the same. 
In the current crazy-fee world, it's best to do these consolidations when fees are low, so that you can afford to send your coins if you want to when fees are high.

This is 100% false. None have been hit with Bitcoin's scale yet, but _many_ have already demonstrated abilities to handle many more tx/s.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:53:37
An alternative viewpoint is: as Bitcoin grows, if there is enough bandwidth in the blocks for further adoption, the userbase may grow faster than the full-node-running percentage of that userbase declines. 
For example, say today there are 1000 Bitcoin users and 100 of them run full nodes. We may assume that with large blocks, only 50 of them would run full nodes. But what if larger blocks, by a factor of reduced fees, enable 4000 more Bitcoin users to join the cause. If the percentage of node-running users maintained, you would have 250 full-node users.
That said, I'm sure there is a decay curve to new users vs. old users being more likely to run nodes, but, in my mind, the difference is still likely to maintain a net increase.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:33:40
Not necessarily disagreeing with you, but FYI "Bitcoin XT" was an attempt to upgrade into a new version of Bitcoin via a hard-fork (similar to how Segwit2x would have gone down). "Bitcoin Unlimited" is not and never was a coin, just another implementation of the Bitcoin client.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:33:15
That's correct. There's generally nothing wrong with a hard fork, technically. The only issue is if you can't get miners on board to promote the forked chain. If a change is made for the _clear, and obvious_ betterment of the project, this isn't a problem (many other coins have hard forked for upgrades with no issue, and Bitcoin did as well back in 2013).
Maybe so. I certainly won't get into the block size argument on this sub, but Satoshi had commented that he expected the blocks to grow with the usage. There are other improvements, outside of a block size increase, that are being promoted. One that I'm interested in seeing turn out is blockchain sharding.
I think all the crypto subs need more healthy levels of skepticism and critical thinking. At the end of the day, developers are all human and make mistakes. Those that own up to their mistakes are the ones that will end up with a usable and increasingly adopted currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:28:50
There's some variance, but assuming a non-Segwit wallet (maybe cut by 30% to estimate fees from a Segwit wallet), here's a good rule of thumb:
```180 bytes per input + 34 bytes per output + 10 bytes```
Generally speaking, an input is a previous transaction output. If the wallet you're using is smart, it will try to find an optimal number of inputs to fulfill the output transaction request.
For example, if I sent myself 1BTC through 7 previous transactions:


Now I want to send .37 BTC somewhere, my wallet can choose a variety of transactions to fulfill this, but the one reasonable option (not minimizing inputs) would be:


This would be 3 inputs, so using the formula above:
```3 * 180 + 1 * 34 + 10```
This is 584 bytes, and according to  950 satoshis per byte is the _current_ cheapest way to send a fast transaction (obviously you can go somewhat lower, but not too low without risk of being dropped from the mempool). At 950 satoshis per byte, you're looking at a 554,800 satoshi fee (currently $88 USD). 
If the wallet had needed to split an input, you would have an extra output (34 * 2) to send the change to a new address.
So with that said, I hope when you need to move your coins, the mempool is less full or you're willing to pay that fee...
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:32:39
That's true, but for coins which do not plan to have LN, SegWit has limited value, so Litecoin having SegWit doesn't make it better -- from purely that stance at least.

- A _lot_ of things are easily testable against the "main network". LN especially so, since it's *off chain*.
- Lack of Segwit is not purely why this was stalled. In part, there was the TXN immutability, which Segwit solved, but could have been solved by other, simpler methods.
- You can call it whatever you'd like. Other coins have scaling roadmaps that do not require systems like LN, and honestly, no "currency of the future" should require something this jank. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 12:54:19
Slight correction but Litecoin does not use SHA-256 (it uses scrypt) and BCH normally has a % of the BTC hashrate based on price the price ratio. It's more vulnerable than BTC but the amount varies from day to day.

It's common knowledge that 1sat/b is sufficient on BCH since the blocks have plenty-o'-space, and the same is true of BTC sometimes. That said a 1sat/b fee costs more on BTC due to the fiat conversion rate.

Either way, those size constraints are the same across each chain, which is why people speak in sats/b.

However, system upgrades via hard forks are _normal_ because the rules of these networks will need to adapt to reality. If they don't, they'll die.

Just a caveat to this, since I used to also think this was true, but you can submit a transaction with 0 fees and still have it processed at this point in time. Unless the blocks become full (like BTC), that should hold true.

It's surprising how many people investing in these currencies don't pay attention to what is going on with competitors.
BCH has a hardfork occurring on the 13th to adjust the difficulty algorithm. This _may_ keep it more profitable for BCH to be mined in the short term, though it's unclear at this point.

It's actually not a very good response, since the analogy makes no sense in regards to digital financial systems like Bitcoin. It's not a car, there is no engine. Off-chain channels make no sense in the analogy at all.
It's uncertain as to whether or not a simple block size increase is sufficient for most use cases, but likely we will still want layer 2 for many use cases (for example, tip bots operate as layer 2 to prevent even small fees from occurring with non-settlement actions).
That said, there's a few caveats to the argument:
- It's not the _block size_ that increases immediately, it's the _block size limit_ which would increase. It's unlikely the block size itself would breach 2MB until broad adoption (which would likely take a significant amount of time), or a significant increase in rapid adoption to hit over 4MB. 
- On that point, it's also false to say there's no going back from a higher limit. A hard-fork upgrade would put in place a higher limit and another hard-fork upgrade could later reduce that limit if there were large advancements in scaling via other, better, mechanisms.
- The blockchain growth calculations have been done, and at the assumption of absolutely full blocks (unlikely, as mentioned above) at 8MB per block (144 blocks per day, 52560 per year), the block chain would grow approximately 410GB per year once the blocks were saturated
- Assuming that rate began next year, a 4TB hard drive would last you 8+ years. They're currently available for ~$100 [1]. Even if we consider crazy UXTO bloat of 50% blockchain size, you're looking at 6 years until you need to upgrade a HDD.
- All decent full node software enables reductions in bandwidth usage and caps, depending on your internet connection. Many users in 1st world countries could easily host a node of this size for the foreseeable future.
- The statement "development is solely under the control of Roger Ver, Jihan &amp; Associates, 100%" is absolutely false as those names are simply major and vocal investors, not developers. The same could be said about many in other communities. There are over 4 different full node alternatives under development, most of which support BTC as well.
I hold both, because I believe hedging your risk is the smart thing to do. A lot of people are spreading FUD (on all sides) due to fear of losing, or wanting to push, their own investments.
Not doing your own research and understanding the actual technical backing of every crypto you want to invest in is a mistake.

I think that may be true, but unless the short-term compromise is at the cost of the future (ie. global warming, etc., as you mentioned), it seems like that's okay.
It's also quite possible to _temporarily_ increase the block size limit and reduce it again later (for blocks created after X time/block).
Trying to live in a world with zero compromise and struggling through unnecessary growing pains is a naive approach.

Just an FYI on this comment, but BCH has a DAA fork coming out on November 13th, around when BTC would become more profitable to mine. It's possible that this change will curb that some, so it's unclear as to whether or not BTC will become more profitable to mine again in the immediate future.

Full nodes can easily be run with blocks up to 48MB on moderate hardware and network throughput available today.

It looks legit at first glance, but I would avoid it. On a server-loaded page, it's always possible for the "random" address you're given to be pre-determined at page load time and the rest of the page to be smoke and mirrors. The server would already know your private key.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:50:57
I also haven't looked deeply at it. It _does_ do away with the EDA, but the replacement DAA looks at the hashpower used in the last 144 blocks (24 hours) and calculated the current difficulty based on that.
I think, without looking into it more, that _if_:


That it will remain more profitable until that threshold is reached.

I mean, that's a fool's argument. You won't get much BTC doing $10 a day, but the gains _could_ be similarly representative.

Most commits are renaming, documentation updates, etc. All reasonably important to the longevity of a project, but not immediately useful to the delivery of something usable. 
The commits noted with "***" (4) seem to have some substance, though I think two of them should be mostly handled by compiler settings [unrolling], and they're all from April. I had some other work to do after I got this far back, sorry.
Does this mean dev work is nearing completion, or does this mean it's not a priority?

That's an amazingly inaccurate understanding of the differences between blocksize and off-chain. It's true that other coins will only be successful as long as _most blocks aren't full_. That said, BCH blocks can scale up to 32MB without a hard fork, which will support low fee traffic for a significant time frame, whilst these beta off-chain scaling technologies are still being developed.

Well, it's not quite infinitely divisible at this point (they can only be divided down to a single satoshi unit, which is 1/100,000,000th of a Bitcoin). If Bitcoin stays _the_ digital currency forever, which I doubt is long-term the case, it'll need a fork to adjust this limit.

This is an absolutely false statement, as ETH just did a hard fork upgrade for their Byzantium upgrade and it went off without a hitch.

That's true, but if the scale-up is reasonably paced (ie. we don't go from 1MB to 128MB in one year), it provides time for the "_correct_" solution to become available.
If that solution is built, available, and practical, community adoption should be relatively straightforward (compared to this B2X nonsense we just had).
If LN is the future, a temporary increase in block size limits to enable time for it's delivery while supporting current users and not stifling adoption seems like a more than reasonable compromise (after saying this I now realize I am describing why B2X was proposed to begin with, shit).
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:59:05
Well, the new DAA is 144 blocks and _if they are mined at 10m intervals_ (maybe longer), it's about 24 hours. It's also a rolling window average, so if the difficulty dramatically spikes or drops in the period of 5-10 blocks, it won't have a very large immediate impact on the difficulty.
edit: So instead of the oscillation pattern we're seeing now between BCH and BTC, I expect to see more ramp-up and cool-down ramps on BCH while using BTC to fill those gaps (maybe). It's largely unknown, I guess we'll see soon...

Not sure why people care about this topic much. During the initial fork, there was an EDA (emergency difficulty adjustment) to move the difficulty down so that the coin could survive with it's limited hashpower support. If it had kept the original BTC difficulty, the next difficulty adjustment would have taken a very long time to be hit.
The EDA itself doesn't do anything harmful, but the sharing of SHA-256 hashpower led to a back-and-forth tug of war for profitability for miners -- also leading to some increased inflation rates on the new chain. There was later a new DAA added (new algorithm to base difficulty on a 144-blocking rolling window average) to help difficulty adjustments be more smooth, and avoid hashpower oscillations (which is good for both chains).

Not sure, it's quite old. I think the idea is that saying "X satoshis" in real conversation is weird (both as "Satoshi" is a Japanese name, and it's foreign/doesn't roll off the tongue).
I actually like it. Depending on the future price of bitcoin, a "bit" would be anywhere from $0.50 to $5.00 most likely, enabling a reasonable division not to small in value (remember, the idea is that you're spending Bitcoin, not some Bitcoin-to-USD mapping).
There's historical relevance pre-Bitcoin for "bit" as a monetary notion also: 
From a US perspective, it's easy to see "bits" as a dollar and "satoshis" as cents.

The sentiment that Japan is a "hire for life" working society has faded away over the last 20 years or so. It's much less common for the current generation to stay with one company for longer than 5 years, which is very similar to turnover elsewhere -- though still somewhat longer.
People claiming that are generally either uninformed or assuming a lot based on media they've seen about Japanese work and company culture.
As someone who was involved very heavily in hiring in SF and here in Tokyo now as well, I'd say the market may be somewhat more thin for experienced talent but not by any significant measure.
At the end of the day, at least for more senior talent, it does usually come down to money. As people mature in their careers, they begin learning what is really important to them. Some maintain faithful to a company, or a passion, but in my experience, the vast majority are looking for strong and stable income to support themselves and their families.

I think the actual theory is more that as a larger block coin gets more usage, more people will be using it, and as such it's opened up to more people who will be able and willing to run a full node.
So for example, on BTC, since it's less demanding to run a node, perhaps 5% of techie users will run one. On BCH, maybe it's only 1% since it's more demanding. _But_, if the chain gets enough usage, that 1% may be as large as the 5% from BTC (in theory).

Kind of a ridiculous article. An engineer who learned via YouTube videos and personal projects is somehow a good interview target? Honestly, this article would make me proactively avoid these exchanges.
As an engineer living in Tokyo, maybe I can provide a tiny bit of insight. The main reasons that these exchanges are starving for engineers is because they still pay well below international market rates (a la U.S. salaries or international companies with operations here in Tokyo[1]) and usually require fluency in Japanese which removes most international talent from the overall hiring pool.
A quote from the article states that "base pay is up 20 to 30 percent from last year, they said, pushing salaries for engineers with five years’ experience to 11 million yen ($102,720)." -- most fresh graduates joining companies in or near Silicon Valley are making more than this at the point of hire, fresh out of school, let alone 5+ years in. Cost of living in Tokyo is somewhat lower, but not by much.
If Coincheck, or companies like them, wanted to pay the market rate I'm making now, I'd probably be inclined to consider the offer. Do these companies really want to spend $350m USD every year or two to cover their missteps than pay their engineers better? Or perhaps they feel that they'll be lucky and not be a target of a major hack (which is obviously naive, given the amount of money on the line and the fact that these exchanges are considerably easier targets than most)?
[1] I feel this is relevant to point out since the traditional salaries for software developers in Tokyo (well, all of Japan) is dismal when compared against most other markets around the globe. Many talented engineers flood out of the country every year to Europe or the US.

He's not lying:
That said, OP used "bcash" in a title over there and the title in general is kind of user-hostile so I don't know what OP expected. Seems like an attempt to incite hostility and would have gotten downvoted to oblivion anyway.
This thread is a weird statement to make, as nobody is probably sending the wrong coin. Just an easy way to get karma from the BTC maximalists.

Segwit is not the only way to fix the malleability issue and most transaction types on BCH have already been fixed.

This is semantics, but generally a "fork" -- specifically a hard-fork -- means there is not a "parent" chain and a "child" chain, but instead a "left" and a "right" would be more a accurate (but strange) way to say it.
The main point of contention is that the new fork is frequently forking _away_ from something they don't like. In this case, there's the Segwit chain vs. BCH which is maybe more interesting to think about.

Litecoin was not a fork of the BTC chain, it was a fork (via `git`) of the source code of BTC. It has it's own (pointless) chain.

Sounds kind of like you already have one...
