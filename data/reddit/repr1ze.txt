Libertarian doesn't mean what you think it means. It's not a particular doctrine or something. Most libertarians have varying positions.

I'm just saying that the term libertarian is an umbrella term that encompasses a ton of ideologies that promote liberty. It doesn't really matter though it's just semantics at this point. I agree though that the term lately has been used to describe minarchists.

So let's institute a monopoly to do the raping and murdering for us!

Libertarians can be minarchists or anarchists.
@_date: 2014-03-09 10:50:09
Not sure if you're joking
@_date: 2014-03-09 22:15:56
Yes yes I agree but as far as terms goes Anarcho-capitalism is a subset of libertarianism. Libertarian does not automatically mean statist or minarchist.

Anarcho-capitalism is a branch of libertarianism. Are you sure you aren't confusing the Libertarian Party of the U.S. with the ideology?

Private monopolies?!
Even if there were such a thing as a private monopoly (which there isn't), why would you institute a bigger more corruptible monopoly to oversee it?

Actually it's not "money" like you're thinking of it. It's more of a ledger system.

Actually I know what it means. It's in the name of the title. You, however seemed to miss the part in voluntarism 101 where they discuss, you know, the only rule that you have to follow to be a voluntarist, lol. Hate to be the one to tell you this but it is a widely accepted fact by statists and anarchists that statism involves coercion, which directly conflicts with the only rule of voluntarism. Being a statist voluntarist is like being a Christian Muslim.

How do you justify having a state which **by definition** is a monopoly on coercion in a given geographical area? How do you convince yourself that having monopolies doesn't conflict with the non aggression principle? How  does the state fund itself if it cannot tax, which of course is the most used form of coercion by which all current states gain capital. 
@_date: 2013-05-19 04:45:55
I figured.
@_date: 2013-05-18 23:46:44
A monopoly on retaliatory what? What was that word you used? **Force**. What dream world are you living in where a state has a retaliatory army and it somehow isn't coercive? It's existence requires the use of coercion via taxes. How do you not understand that? You never answered me about how you're paying for this by the way. Also how can you be sure that this state will only use it's powers in a voluntary way? This entire premise is absurdity piled on top of absurdity. This is the most contradictory set of beliefs I have ever witnessed. It makes no sense. How can you even have a state and call it voluntary? Having a state means you are coercing people not to compete with you in whatever area you are in. Therefore having a state sanctions "retaliatory force" sound neat and all but it's still coercion no matter how peaceful and non violent this retaliatory force is. By definition it is keeping out competition of other "retaliatory" forces. There's no grey area here, I'm sorry.
Now hurry up and cherry pick my argument for out of context quotes to use while ignoring all of my questions.
This is why I didn't want to debate you. I knew it would devolve into semantics and you not knowing basic definitions.

Hahahaha! This is great! There's so much butthurt in this thread.. we should have the government to distribute it evenly
@_date: 2013-05-18 23:14:22
A state **monopoly** by definition is coercive. Do you know what a state is? or a monopoly? Sorry man but I'm gonna have to cut this short. I can see that this conversation is going to turn into me giving you basic definitions from an Econ textbook and I really don't feel like doing that. You honestly have NO clue what you are talking about.
@_date: 2013-05-18 22:04:18
I don't think voluntarism means what you think it means
@_date: 2013-05-16 05:16:33
I dont even
@_date: 2013-05-15 19:32:20
Hahaha this convo was great to read. You have no counter argument do you?
Ad hom attack in..
@_date: 2013-05-19 04:02:03
Since when is justice coercion? Also the non aggression principle isn't relative to anything. It's an axiom.
Care to address any of my questions?
