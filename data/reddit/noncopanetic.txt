I agree. The major problems facing Bitcoin are scalability, volatility of the currency, and a lack of good ways to store your Bitcoins. But privacy still matters, because it's the one area where Bitcoin can excel, and normal banks can't follow.
I did not know about ZeroCash, and I'm going to take a more detailed look at it later. It looks like they've improved on a lot of weaknesses of ZeroCoin. Thanks!


This is an excellent opportunity to rag on a pet issue of mine. Why isn't Tor support in Bitcoin enabled by default? I'm not suggesting that all peer connections go over Tor (especially when syncronizing), but it would be nice to submit transactions to the network via Tor.

They're drafting legislation to make it illegal.

These predictions are only pessimistic in hindsight. If they had come true, they would be realistic, not pessimistic. 


Don't be an asshole.

Why are you giving him more attention? It's probably nothing anyway.

VISA handles about 2000 transactions per second. This is about 200 times what the Bitcoin network currently handles. If the Bitcoin network handled as much traffic as VISA, running full nodes would be out of reach for most ordinary users.
This wouldn't be for bandwidth or CPU reasons. It would be because of increasing blockchain size and synchronization times. After 5 years at an average transaction rate of 0.3 tps, the blockchain is at 21 GB. I haven't synchronized the client from scratch in a while, but I imagine it's still pretty slow.

Don't get me wrong, tokens are great. But they didn't come up with the idea, despite it being very obvious. A web startup named Stripe came up with the idea, and Visa just copied the idea in a reasonable timeframe.
Which brings me to my point: credit card companies don't innovate, but they do copy other innovations reasonably quickly.

You're shifting the focus of the argument. I'm arguing that thin clients compromise privacy compared to full clients.


That's a good point. If said governments aren't willing to do that, then it's irrelevant that they can. I'll edit my original post.

Let's not name-call. Let's look at the [original article]( and his predictions, and figure out how many were correct.


No. Productivity change went up again in '98, and continued to rise in '99. It dropped off again after that.




This is a little vague, but I'm going to call this correct. Outsourcing increased dramatically between '98 and '01.




I disagree. Fax machines send documents from one place to another slightly faster than before. The Internet is more useful than that, particularly its ability to archive and search information.




Oil is more expensive now than it was at peak in the '70s. Correct.
Total: two correct, and four wrong.

You're misrepresenting my position. These problems are solvable, but the current speed of development will not solve them soon enough. 
I believe that either some other cryptocurrency will solve these problems first, or that credit card companies will get their shit together and create a useful way of sending money across borders.

Sure. To make the discussion clearer, let's pick a concrete example. The Android Bitcoin client, written by Schildbach, which uses BitcoinJ. It uses the `filterload` command in the Bitcoin protocol. This command tells the remote node to only send transactions matching a certain filter. 
The problem with this is that the remote node can watch the transactions that go out to your client, and know with a high level of certainty that those transactions can be spent or were spent by that client.
Since the connection also isn't encrypted, any three letter agency who is, say, logging all traffic in the United States that goes over port 8333 can also perform this attack.


~~There are ways to shut down a server besides physically seizing it. DDoS. BGP hijacking. If it's hosted by a company, call them and socially engineer them into shutting it down. Pretend to be a reliable server while the developers are selecting servers, then shut down. I think a highly motivated attacker could reduce a group of centralized servers to less than 90% uptime.~~
~~Granted, government agencies are not what I'd call 'highly motivated.' I mean this in the sense of someone who will think of five stragegies to accomplish something, and pursue all of them.~~

I disagree. He may have said it in jest at some point, but he also said it in perfect seriousness while writing [this article]( in June 1998.

I'll take a stab at it.
I believe that Bitcoin cannot become a widely used currency (where 'widely used' means that it is used on a daily basis by more than 10% of the worldwide population) because of its [current scalability flaws.]( I don't believe that there will be a Bitcoin solution within the next two years that has privacy, security, and scalability at the same time. In that two years, I think we're likely to see a competitor that offers privacy from major governments, while being highly scalable.
There are thin clients, but they compromise either privacy, or ~~Bitcoin's resistance to being shut down by powerful governments, or both~~. Additionally, these thin clients contact servers, and it's not clear how those servers will be paid for in the long run, making the operators of those servers vulnerable to bribery.

Could you clarify what you mean by side chains? There are multiple side chain proposals. How many side chains should be created?
@_date: 2014-09-16 18:56:06


That's a fair point. I made this be about scalability concerns, when security (your coins shouldn't be stolen) and privacy (the government shouldn't be able to know what you're buying) are important parts of the discussion. I was talking about privacy because you asked me to elaborate on why thin clients sacrifice privacy.


I don't agree that Bitcoin generally provides more privacy than our current system. Addresses are pseudoanonymous, but the amounts, the times, and the IP addresses of people who make transactions are not protected, even against non-governments. 
I agree that it provides more privacy against major governments. However, I think that the current Bitcoin client leaks enough information that outside of laundry systems or exchanges, governments can probably track your purchases with a reasonable degree of accuracy.
Do you know how coin selection works in Bitcoin? The client looks at the coins it can spend, then chooses a random selection that has enough to fulfill the transaction. It's been like this for *years*. There is no way to separate two anonymous identities except to maintain two different wallet files.
