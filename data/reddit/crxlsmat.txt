Upvote for making what is (today) an obscure literary reference.  Now if only I could shim up the market with pieces of aluminum cut out of beer cans.

I just lost my grandson last Friday to a horrible genetic disease called Spinal Muscular Atrophy.  I didn't even know what it was until my daughter found out that she was a carrier for it and then we found out the baby's father was too... 
I'm not asking you to give a million dollars.  I'm not even asking you to give a thousand dollars, but if you wanted to contribute something so that maybe in the future parents don't have to go through what I'm watching my daughter go through, it would mean a lot to this stranger on the internet.
It's a good thing you're doing.  This happens to be my new pet project.  There are lots of good projects out there, I applaud you for wanting to do something with what you have.

I had three orders in from $16.5 down to about  $15k  just in case of a flash crash. I got on a two hour flight, landed, and saw that my orders had filled. I was tremendously amused.

Congratulations to you.  Student loans are a soap box that I get on and yell really, really loudly about. I'll spare everybody here my rant.  :)  You made a good decision.

I'm not making light of this in the slightest, but seriously... It's Ukraine.  I'm surprised this doesn't happen more often.  Not exactly the most secure country in the world.  Last year I put in a bid to build a data center there and almost a third of the budget was to provide security for the people and equipment.  Serious conversations held in meeting rooms as we put this together were about how many ex special forces guys did we need to hire and what exactly were the laws about who could carry firearms and what could they carry and where.  Rule of law is kind of a veneer in a lot of countries and people who are doing business that attract attention (that is, make money) need to be very aware of what they are doing at all times.  
I hope everything works out for this guy and I hope he's ok.

I use log scales *almost* exclusively.  It's really a very useful method of visualizing the action.

Not sure.  I'll let you know after I figure my taxes out after all my stop losses executed.   But yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm way positive on the liquidity side today.  Now just waiting to get an idea where bottom is so I can put it all back in.

At that price I'll take three.  Thx
