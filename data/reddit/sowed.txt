Facebook is the most popular media owner? But it doesn't own the media that people upload, it just mediates it. If it owned it, then as soon as a video was uploaded to Facebook, if it were then uploaded to YouTube, Facebook could issue a takedown because they own it, forcing anyone who wants that video to watch it on Facebook.

This isn't a no true Scotsman situation.
Part of being a Muslim is believing that the entire world should be converted or killed.  ISIS is totally on board with that.
Part of being a Buddhist is nonviolence.  If you're a Buddhist terrorist, you're going against what your religion states.
My point is that ISIS is following Islam with their actions, while the groups you are talking about are going against Buddhism to curb Islamic expansion in their areas.
Do you see the difference?  Because I'm not saying no true Buddhist would be violent.  I'm just saying that the motivation for the violence in their case isn't *sourced* in their religion.
@_date: 2015-08-29 19:05:25
Except there's no argument that they are following Buddhism with their actions.  They can claim to, but they're going against the ideas of Buddhism.

If what I have read elsewhere in these comments is true, the man was involved in cocaine trafficking (already far worse than simply using and enjoying cocaine and having sex with prostitutes) and snitched on his crew, which is even scumnier than trafficking cocaine in the first place.  That behavior tells you far more about his character than the enjoyment of cocaine and prostitutes does.
If a guy is involved in a drunk driving hit and run, do you also bring up how he had gotten a few speeding tickets in the past for sober driving 70 in a 65? What's the point of that? It groups in people who have *only* gotten a few such speeding tickets with this scumbag who drove drunk and caused an accident then fled the scene.
In the same way, this guy is an outlier in the group of people who have enjoyed cocaine and prostitutes. I'm not trying to say cocaine and sex with prostitutes are wholesome and harmless activities to engage in, but that the emphasis OP put on those aspects is misplaced.
Pull my head out of my ass? Why are you being so aggressive? I'm not defending the man in any way. I'm saying that putting the emphasis on the least scummy of his behaviors is a stupid way of attacking a man who should be attacked.

Yes, that's easy to regurgitate.  Have you even looked into the genealogies yourself?  Not only is it nonsense to even consider Joseph's genealogy if the whole virgin birth thing is true, but the number of generations mentioned between David and Jesus differs dramatically.


This is a false dichotomy.  We're talking about many different people who wrote these things and many more who translated, edited, and canonized them (and ignored some parts).  Are you seriously claiming that if any edits/rewrites occurred, that they would have cleared all possible conflicts in one fell swoop?

The number of generations between David and Jesus differs dramatically between the two.
You wanna play the game of "one was the genealogy of Joseph and the other of Mary"?  Then the Joseph lineage is meaningless if Jesus were born of a virgin.
I mean, it's just the son of god, not a big deal, not anything that it would be important to get straight, right?  The other argument that Matthew deliberately omitted multiple generations just for the sake of numerology should make you shake your head.  So either the number of generations between David and Mary *or* David and Joseph (it doesn't actually matter) is impossibly different for Joseph and Mary to have been alive at the same time, or Matthew deliberately left out multiple generations for the sake of numerology in the most important genealogy in history.  Please explain that to me.

My guess is that the drop is going to come after the fork. People are buying to get more of the new coin. Other people are buying because the price is going up and this is causing more media attention. Those on the fence about Bitcoin are jumping in.
I'm guessing there will be a correction of a few hundred dollars in a week or so, but the fork will be the real drop.

Sure, if ancient legal records and the bloodline of the flesh of the demigod Jesus Christ are somehow of equal importance, then we can let the Mary and Joseph part go.

As another user pointed out, the fees are what we need to worry about, not the taxes.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:25:37
Then I feel what you're talking about is just the appreciation in value of holding BTC at all. What does this have to do with purchasing things with BTC and whether or not you replace that BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:08:43
It is a combination of the two. People in the know want more of both coins. Price increases. Media attention increases. Number of people who have heard of Bitcoin increases, and along with it, number of people who buy into Bitcoin for the first time increases. Price increases.

Why are you attacking the log scale so much? I read most of your comments, and your problem is that you think this graphic is implying future predictions. The log scale makes sense to help visualize the sharp rises and falls from a proportional standpoint, which makes plenty of sense considering how people are likely to think about their gains and losses.
The graphic is completely clear about it being a log scale; log scales aren't inherently misleading.  It is also clear that the green lines do not predict the future price.
The worst thing you can fault them for is continuing the green lines further than they should have, as it seems to appear as a prediction at first glance, and that could be misleading if someone doesn't read the text.

Wolves aren't dogs.
Dogs split from wolves.
Before dogs, there were only wolves, but now there are both.
Someone unfamiliar with the animals *could* mistake a wolf for a dog or vice versa.
Now let's say wolves are worth 10 times what dogs are, and this person has heard about this and wants to invest.
If I present this person a dog and claim it is a wolf, then they are going to think it's the wolves they've heard so much about.
Every exchange calls BTC Bitcoin and BCH Bitcoin Cash. People who talk about these coins call them the same, save for Roger Ver.  What's not to get about this? He's deliberately misleading naive people.
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:36:46
He doesn't know that if you fork and one coin is called Bitcoin and the other is called Bitcoin Cash, that the latter isn't called "Bitcoin."
If he feels that BCH is the one true vision of what the original Bitcoin was meant to be, then continuing down his path should be enough. If he believes in that idea and thinks it's the best way, then the name should not be the end of the world to him, but it is. The fact that he deliberately misrepresents BCH as "Bitcoin" shows that he is trying to confuse naive newcomers into thinking that BCH is what they hear about on the news, from their friends, what they see stores accepting increasingly, etc., And that's untrue. BCH is not that coin.
Edit: Not sure whether it's hilarious or sad that this comment has the controversial dagger. Nothing I said here is controversial.

@_date: 2017-05-23 00:20:40
I think you're missing the point. Someone getting on your Reddit account and saying you produce child porn, for example, is not enough evidence to say that you yourself did that. 
A screen name and text is not video evidence, it's not a voice recording, it's not even as good as a signed, handwritten note that handwriting analysis could be performed on.
I'm not saying he absolutely didn't write that stuff, but it's nowhere near enough evidence to be claiming that he absolutely did.  The justice system knows this, which is why the charges brought against him don't include soliciting a murder.

Ugh, even worse story here. I went through the effort to figure out how to mine Bitcoin in 2011, but gave up after a month of pretty low returns, and lost the wallet that had those returns. Granted, it's probably only worth $5 now, but I should have kept mining, or just bought a hundred bitcoins.

That's not a fair comparison. Bitcoin gets a way smaller share of media coverage of currencies and investments than Trump did as far as candidate coverage. Who cares if it's good or bad if it's talked about nonstop?
But if all you ever heard about Bitcoin is one article a year ago and you just vaguely associate it with drugs and crime, that isn't good.

Haha okay, I live in "that place" and Bitcoin is becoming quite well known. The issue is that the learning curve is sharp if people want to actually understand what Bitcoin is and how it works.
Calling it an investment is already obfuscating the whole affair. You can treat it like an investment, but to pitch it as an investment to the general populace is a bad idea.

Considering the impact of Bitcoin has been basically nothing thus far, if it follows this curve, then it will be actually used for things more and more, which should translate to value. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:29:33
No, that obviously was unclear, as he *always* is when it comes to this question, this very simple yes/no question. You go to any fucking church in the nation on a Sunday morning, and ask the people walking into or out of that building if they're a Christian or if they believe in God, and they will give you a very concise answer: yes.
He can't give that because he is not a Christian and he does not believe in the Christian God in a meaningful sense. Maybe you should read Maps of Meaning before assuming you know what he thinks based on his vague non-answers.
@_date: 2018-12-27 21:23:55
Wow it's so clear that you watched some show that plays a few clips of what he says and doesn't get into any of his actual views.
@_date: 2018-12-27 21:21:07
Well this stuff is really complicated, man!
@_date: 2018-12-28 20:48:46
 start at 1:26:30 for his many definitions of "God" which not only don't agree with the Bible, but don't agree with each other.
That's my evidence that he doesn't believe in the Christian God.
Self help isn't even his main thing. None of his religious or philosophical stuff is explicitly self help stuff anyways.
And he's dangerous because he gives questioning Christians a framework through which to toss atheistic or even just non-Christian arguments into the nether of Peterson's vagueness, even though he never addresses anything. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 18:21:00
Sorry, you think that a professor *ought* to be vague? And that that is somehow a benefit for students?
He redefines words only when pressed, but uses his own personal definitions all the time, and does not qualify them with the caveat that he's using them in a nonstandard way.
He does this with "believe" and with "God" which is why so many Christians are suckered into thinking he's a Christian who believes in God (actually believes in the God described in the Bible) which he isn't.
Your defense of him is just evidence for my point that he's trouble because he manages to get multiple groups of people to buy into his ideas due to thinking he's part of their group when he isn't. And when I say buy into I mean both emotionally and financially.

Alright fair enough. I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt so I am about 3/4 through Maps of Meaning and frankly, he's got some interesting and novel ideas there. I agree that the more popular book is just shockingly obvious advice that apparently tons of young men never figured out for themselves.
I don't take him too seriously when it comes to political stuff but I do take him more seriously on philosophy and religion in the sense that he is either masterfully misleading or painfully inept at concisely explaining his views. His book makes me lean towards the latter.
But to hear my Christian mother tell it, the man is a Christian and believes in her God, which he absolutely doesn't.
