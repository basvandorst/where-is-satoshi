The comments here exemplify the toxicity of the bitcoin community.

Again, very sorry logic fails to penetrate your thick brain.

Sorry for your lacking intelligence. This is done day and night in the penny stocks in which the entire market cap is often times under $200k. I've seen it fail sometimes, but I've seen it executed successfully far more often.

Special kinda stupid right here. Let me explain as simply (since it's evident anything intellectual will go over your head) as possible one manipulation technique:
This requires access to substantial capital. Assuming bitcoin is hovering at 6,500 do the following:
1. Buy up all the sell orders from 6,500 through 7,000
2. Place a large buy wall at 7,000 to support this new increase in price
3. Place hundreds of very small sell orders (so the book doesn't appear to have a sell wall) at 7,001 or thereabouts. 
4. Wait for "investors" seeing the price increase to FOMO and buy up your sell orders.
5. Once you've sold all the stock you originally bought (and any additional stock needed to maintain the support wall) remove said support wall.
Congratulations, you've just made 7.7% ROI. This does obviously come with some risk if another party with a huge source of capital decides to sell into your pump or support wall...but that's exactly the reason most of these groups are organized into a "whalepool". Everyone gets a piece of the pie.

Lol, ignorance is thick with this one. Sure, Enron may be a good example, but I don't have enough fingers and toes to count the number of exit-scams in the crypto space. 50% of ICO's from 2017 are no longer working on their "projects". You really drank the cool-aid huh?

I don't think you understand what fundamentals are.

Keep drinking the kool-aid

You sound thirsty. Hodl on to your drink! Don't want to drop it with those weak hands of yours.
