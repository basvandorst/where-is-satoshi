I do use Electrum for my buying and spending. But I want to use something just to store a few BTC for years. Why is Electrum superior to a paper wallet?
@_date: 2016-08-27 13:18:41
AIUI, the point is that one cannot spend multiple times from a paper wallet address. One should instead import the private key into something like Electrum and thus remove all the funds. People who want to spend a specific amount from the paper wallet have a problem since there is no "return" address. Is that luke-jr's issue?

You mean that instead of hiring people with names and credentials one should just hire (and pay) unknown individuals.

@_date: 2015-06-12 19:42:58
Thanks. I did understand that. The point of the art is that there is a QR code on the front which is the public address. The private key is what allows you to sweep those funds from that public address.
What I didn't understand was: why would you want to accept funds via QR to one address, but change the private key so that you could not access said funds.

Is your view that Bitcoin is a trustless system and hence to "handle individual ECDSA private keys manually" requires trust?
In other words: any form of physical Bitcoin violates the way that many people (including yourself) conceptualise Bitcoin - trustless nodes / people which collectively (via the blockchain POW) create a trustful system?
Or have I misrepresented you?

Thanks. I just used Casascius as an example. So are we saying that, in any case where the first eight digits is provided, there is no way to check on the blockchain.
We have to go direct to the producer of the good (e.g. physical Bitcoin) so they can tell us the full address. Right?

Does this apply to any amount of purchase? For example, what if you want $10 of BTC? I can understand (just about) if you wanted to buy $5,000. 
Do the regulations state that ID must be recorded for *any* amount? Or is this a CYA from the installer / owner just in case they are one day accused of anything remotely suspicious?
People who state that "your bank has your ID" are missing the point. First, Bitcoin is supposed to be "better" than the banks. This means not having to jump through masses of invasive ID and questioning requirements. Second, if you give a scan of your passport to the bank, then at least you know who has it. That's rather different to providing it to the individual (whomever that is) that owns or runs a Bitcoin ATM. 
Also, the website is deceptive. The "How does it work" says nothing about requiring 'phone verification or ID. At least it should mention this so that people know in advance. The OP is upset, in part, because he only found out as he started to use it. The owner should have been upfront.

Thank you for these links. I should have checked before I posted. I now have five more questions based on the information at the wiki.
1. The wiki mentions "HD wallets." AIUI, the seed (the string of random words) creates the private key which creates the public key and so on. If I destroyed my hard drive with my Electrum wallet, I could enter the seed into a new version of Electrum on another computer to regenerate my private key and public key and hence the wallet. Yes? Where else could I enter the seed? Just on Electrum or in some other online or offline wallet?
2. The wiki mentions multi-sig addresses which start with 3. I have some of these addresses for Electrum and TrustedCoin. AIUI, I have one key on my hard drive and TrustedCoin has the other. When I type in my password to authorise the transaction, TrustedCoin also signs the transaction and hence we have a 2 out of 2 signing of my public key. Does that make sense?
3. The wiki says: "Addresses are not wallets nor accounts, and do not carry balances. They only receive funds, and you do not send "from" an address at any time. Various confusing services and software[who?] display bitcoins received with an address, minus bitcoins sent in random unrelated transactions as an "address balance", but this number is not meaningful: it does not infer the recipient of the bitcoins sent to the address has spent them, nor that they still have the bitcoins received." Am I correct that one should say that one sends funds from a wallet (rather than from an address)? And that the address represents the BTC that a private key can transact with? How would you accurately describe an "address"? 
4. A "mainline address" simply means an address that starts with 1 or 3 and is not a "testnet address". Correct?
5. Public keys start with 0x04 which is "EOT". What does this mean? (Please explain in a simple fashion!)
Thanks again!

Thanks again! Why would a miner choose (or not choose) to include any transactions? My impression from reading is that, today at least, empty blocks are frowned upon (correct me if I am wrong).
Also, then, does that mean that the "winning" result (when the miner finds the correct hash) is, itself, called a "transaction" (rather than just having transactions within the block)?

@_date: 2015-05-27 18:50:42
Thank you for your helpful replies. I think that I understand now.
My confusion was that I imagined the blockchain process as working in two ways. The first was "ownership" of a public address on the blockchain (through control of the private key). The second was that of the transaction process which transfers ownership of coins from Alice to Bob. Since the reason to control an address is the ability to transact the coins, it is more helpful for me to understand this as one situation rather than as two. And it is the signature (which derives from the private key) which is required to transact.
The other issue I did not realise was the need to resolve the difference between the public key and the public address. I knew that the two were not the same, but I didn't realise that the public key of Alice needed to be transmitted since the address where she received coins was, in itself, insufficient to complete the transaction to Bob. 
Please let me know if this makes sense!

I see. Because I am aware that the public address is base58 encoded. But I didn't know about the private key.

With a debit card / credit card / checkbook/ etc.

Thanks - that is most instructive. 
One more question: am I right that the BitAccess machines are unique inasmuch as they have facial recognition which checks the photo from the ID card with that of the person. Is this correct?

What fucking casino shit was this?
@_date: 2015-11-04 21:11:20
I'm sure I saw it on a video where BitAccess was interviewed. I'll try to find it. 
Another question: are there any advantages to funding customers from the hot wallet compared to buying in real time from an exchange? I know that in Texas use of the hot wallet means the operator is not a money transmitter. Are there any non-regulatory benefits?

At what point do you draw the line?
Isn't Bitcoin supposed to be this wonderful "disruptive" technology that's different from banks. Even my bank doesn't try to facially identify me!

Please spell out to me the attraction of minecraft to young people! Why is it so big?

I think you just answered your own question.
Entering user ID != Confirming that user ID is that of the user via facial scan.

So for two weeks I will have unconfirmed transactions unless some miner accepts my low fee transactions. Correct?

Sorry about my rudeness earlier. I could have phrased it better.
@_date: 2015-11-02 20:31:30
Thanks - this is very informative.
So if an operator did not have a recycler presumably he would want a machine with a big cash box which he could stack with cash. Presumably otherwise the danger would be that a big sell order would deplete the float.
Also, in terms of the dispenser, the Genesis1 has a 6,800 note capacity. So I assume that means it can dispense up to 6,800 individual notes in one transaction?
Also, I know that machines have a validator which checks whether currency is real. How does it do this? In a supermarket, for example, the cashier just uses a pen to check the note. And how can the ATM check for the hundreds of currencies that are accepted?

Boycott their asses, boyz!

Sure I can appreciate that there are issues. But my impression is that Rebit still works after over a year in business so they must be doing something right.

My concern is that, with Electrum, one can select a specific .onion server or allow Electrum to select automatically from dozens of servers. The former requires the user to believe that a specific .onion server is decent and hence one is using that server for all queries. The latter approach means that one is querying a different server (probably) each time one runs Electrum which provides a level of diversity that I find appealing. 
It does not appear possible to select a number of servers as one can do in the .torrc file. 
Hence, my initial response, is to allow Electrum to select automatically in order to use different servers (.onion and non-.onion each time). What do you think? Thanks again for your helpful responses.

Thank you. Are there exit nodes which are non-SSL?
I remember reading on one of the Tor Project's pages some time ago that they scan all exit nodes to check they are behaving legitimately. For example, not doing a MITM attack.
