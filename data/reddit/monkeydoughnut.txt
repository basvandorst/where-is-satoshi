Swings up and down 30% for no reason, how serious can we really be??

The letter says that that won't work. Even matching a buyer to a seller and not handling btc falls under the MSB definition they are now throwing out.

person as to buyer and seller, while technically might by in violation if done as a business, I would say would be very, very low on the FinCen list....  as long as your $$$ amounts are low

is everything working? I played demo and dealer cards would show one total but their actual "total" number in gray showed something else... looking at their cards would lead to incorrect betting

Based on page two of Fincen's MSB fact sheet:
"To meet the definition of an MSB, a person must conduct more than $1,000 in business with one person
in one or more transactions (in one category of activity listed above) on any one day. A business is an
MSB for each activity for which it meets this threshold. However, there is one exception. No activity
threshold applies to the definition of money transmitter. A person that engages as a business in the
transfer of funds is a money transmitter and an MSB, regardless of the amount of transfer activity."
I would say this constitutes engaging in transfer of funds since he is transfering BTC to buyer.

Your comparison is basically how long to scan 8 QR codes vs swipe 8 credit cards....
I'll take the much faster CC swipe, especially as is much easier to turn in to work and/or track my expenses with :)

You need a new "bank". I have never heard of a bank that will not do a money order.
ps.  assuming your landlord would accept BTC (big if and not likely) your BTC payment would have cost you $80 here - 1% getting funds into BTC and the 1% for the landlord to get back to USD (I know I would charge you for this)... so at least for your 3hrs work you saved $50.

umm.. You guys need MSB registration... you cannot be "involved" in the exchange of bitcoin between 3rd parties otherwise...  part of FinCen's "exchange" of clause.  Only way you might not be is if you don't ever touch or see the USD or BTC.  Right now you escrow the BTC which you then "transmit" to buyer...
Expect a FinCen letter soon....

CoinValidation is just one step in making BitCoins no different from other currency. Another layer, another offering, another cost (yeah I get end user doesn't pay directly... but does ultimately pay)
