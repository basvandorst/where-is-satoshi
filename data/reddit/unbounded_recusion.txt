If your definition of stability is that it never changes, then bitcoin is even worse than USD. The idea of being paid in a currency that could lose half its value in a few days is ... unpalatable. Since literally *all* of the goods and services I need are denominated in USD, this is not a problem that bitcoin can ignore if it wants to be a currency. 
And of course, you did say that bitcoin is deflationary, which kind of ruins your point. 
And yes, currencies must be easy to use. You might feel nice and smug about being part of the elite group that knows how to use bitcoin, but your average human being needs to be able to pay for their Frappuccino at Starbucks quickly and easily, even if you don’t like or care about what they’re doing.

You’re taking a problem that’s real, unstably high income disparity, and trying to blame it on something you dislike. There are plenty of ways to flatten the income distribution curve even with inflationary currencies, so to blame that on inflationary currencies alone is just silly.

Two things. 
First, one cannot coherently claim that governments are hostile to crypto as an investment vehicle, other than fears of fraud or bubbles. Financial innovation has been totally accepted in the US for well over a century, and new financial instruments crop up every few years. 
So assuming that governments fear cryptos as *currencies*, then all they need to do is trigger either a confidence panic, or a deflationary spiral. The former could be done a variety of ways, but hinting that Satoshi’s 10% is in their hands might do it. The latter is likely to happen by itself anyways, but buying and destroying BTC would do the trick too.

Sure: the lightning layer proves that blockchain is useless, because its literally about not using the blockchain for regular transactions. 
It also requires a lot of trust, since it’s possible to confirm invalid transactions if a node is offline for too long. This won’t happen in regular use, but it does mean that long DDOS attacks might become very lucrative. 
Also, it’ll probably be “in development” forever. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:49:49
That’s true for large wire transfers, but the opposite for small transactions via cash, debit, or credit. I can tap my Apple Watch on the machine and pay for my coffee instantaneously, and even get a 1-5% cash back reward for my purchase. 
Bitcoin on the other hand can sometimes take hours due to events outside my view or control, unless if I’m willing to pay a fee to the miners. A small fee in the $20-30 range is nbd if you’re transferring the down payment on a house, but that’s ruinous if you just want your Starbucks.
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:14:51

Blockchain does nothing to solve the interface between reality and digital, so all these supply chain blockchain ideas are pointless. If a human or sensor lies to the computer containing the private keys, then the immutability of the entire system is defeated by garbage input. 
Beyond that, blockchains require a ton of power and hardware to run. Currently that’s possible because you reward miners with the currency, which is the source of the pyramid scheme accusations. In a non-financial system, you’ll need to find a way to convince random people to spend their electricity budget on your system, or you’ll need to run your own nodes. Once you reach the point of running your own nodes and having all the encryption keys, you just have a really slow and inefficient centralized system.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:57:18
I call nonsense on the “reality to digital gap”. Nothing about the blockchain fixed the issue of the computer being fed shoddy or incomplete data. All it can help is prove what the computer with the signing key was told, not that information was fundamentally correct. 
There are two problems with rewards. 
They only work right now because the rewards are also money, and bitcoin is currently on the rise. On a hypothetical inventory tracking system, what drives the value of these rewards? Sure, they’re finite, but so are original beanie babies. Rarity does not mean value. 
Secondly, that “finite” thing is a big problem. Once the mining reward stops, *someone* has to pay the miners for all that electricity and silicon. That might fine if it’s a currency that goes into a deflationary deadlock; the rising value means that’s its worth it to tip the miners to get in or out. But if you are trying to create a non-monetary industrial blockchain for practical uses, this is a *big* problem.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:18:55
I’m certain there’s manipulation and fraud going on, the question is how much. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:24:13

@_date: 2018-02-01 02:33:38

Hostile hostile. Not liking information that disagrees with your worldview I see. 
You’ll notice I said “not doing a good job of being a currency”, since I’m going to be charitable and assume you actually read my entire post. 
The problem is if bitcoin is a bad currency (but still a currency as you’ll hurry to point out), then why should people use it as a currency? Sure, it’s deflationary, but so are original Beanie Babies. Just because there are fewer of a thing doesn’t necessarily mean that you should be buying your coffee with it. 
I notice that you also ignored the rest of my comments on analyzing bitcoin like a financial instrument. You were in a big hurry to say that bitcoin is “more”, but very quiet once I started speculating what that “more” might be.
@_date: 2018-02-01 03:54:25
You are not making this easy. 
Currencies must perform the following two functions:
1. Be a stable store of value. 
2. Be an easy means of transmitting this value for goods and services. 
Bitcoin really isn’t doing that too well. Wild fluctuations in value and slow transaction speeds are genuine problems if you want to be able to use bitcoin for all kinds of mundane financial transactions. 
But that’s fine, it can be “more”. So let’s talk about “more”. 
Bitcoin isn’t a tangible asset with other uses, like a car or house. Since bitcoins are fungible, they also can’t be compared to stuff like art or collectibles. 
One might be interested in comparing bitcoin to gold, but that comparison isn’t fair. Gold has a lot of physical world non-financial uses, such as jewelry and electronics. And the way that gold and bitcoin enter and exit the market just make them different beasts. 
The only fair comparison I can see is to compare bitcoin to a purely financial instrument like a stock, bond, future, etc. Like bitcoin, these have purely digital representations, and are often purchased in the hopes of future profit. 
Except there’s a problem: financial instruments have their value driven by something. For stocks this is the assets of the company, along with current and expected revenue. For bonds it’s the expected repayment of debt, etc. For futures it’s the expected movement in some sort of already valuable financial instrument or asset (oil, soybean, other stocks, whatever).
Of course, the tick by tick value of a financial instrument is tricky. It’s relatively easy to tell what the current revenue of a company is, but predicting future revenue is hard. We know what a bond will yield, but predicting whether or not a company will default is hard. The point isn’t that the market always gets the value right, but that the underlying assets provide some grounding for that market value. 
So, what’s the underlying value of bitcoin? Bitcoin does not produce revenue streams like a stock, nor is it a debt that should be repaid. It’s not backed by an asset who’s movement affects other financial values, like a future on pork or oil. 
And before you say “the blockchain”, that’s just moving the problem, since you now need to find some way to explain the value of the blockchain now.
Honestly, I can only see two things backing bitcoin right now:
1. The demand for transactions normally prohibited by regulators (money laundering, illicit goods, etc.)
2. The hope that bitcoin will be worth more tomorrow. 
\ starts to fall apart if regulators get involved, especially in the exchanges.  means it’s a bubble.

Nice strawman. 
The claim is that discretionary spending will reduce, not stop. What makes it catastrophic is when places that provide discretionary services (think Starbucks) start to post losses, necessitating layoffs and store closures. This in turn causes people to cut back deeper on discretionary spending, worsening the problem. None of this requires people’s spending to stop, only that their spending reduce enough to trigger a positive feedback loop. 
We’ve actually seen economic spirals like this before, as they’re possible to trigger without deflationary currencies. The worst one I can think of is the European economic meltdown in the 1840s after the potato famine swept across Europe.
