the crypto world needs more people like you. Welcome to the battle field!!

you need to make sure they are serious about reading and studying about all the info you share with them.
It's not rocket science so all you need to do is give them info like Satoshi's white paper (if you understand it then you can explain to them in case they are lost in translation).
After that, they should have a pretty decent picture about bitcoin and they should ask you more about it...
When you want to invest in something the main principle in action is to study the product from top to bottom for a while (days or weeks) and always make your homework, read, search, speak to people and make sure your not convincing them because if they understand the basics of it they will convince themselves about how good bitcoin can be.
Good luck

you better use that money to buy BTC's you can trade with that money and made on average from 15 up to 45% margin a month or in medium term on a monthly basis.
Not bad for just seating at home and at the same time you can study about the different Ventures that people and organizations are creating for Bitcoin and it's integration in the world.
Good Luck.

Last but not least, about btcglobal.net
I'm not convince about them to be honest.
we have few questions for them;
1) How they planing to gain more acc holder than MtGox?
2) where on earth they are planing to buy so many btc's to match MtGox?
3) And how they are going to balance the operations in general?
 
I'm so curious and exited about the possible answer that I'm dreaming as we speak.
I love competition and I think is good and healthy for the btc market in general.
But, the world doen't need more btc exchanges (at least the Spanish world).
What we need is a btc ecosystem where people buys and sells their products and services based on btc.
It's just our opinion.
thank you again.

there is two obstacles,
sorry for the confusion.
we are educating the spanish speaking countries about it and thanks to our friend and followers the message is getting to the right people.
The other obstacle is that some of the new Bitcoiners in Central and South America are looking to buy and sale Bitcoins and that's great but when need more specialist in financial law (hopefully some one who speak spanish) to give us the overview about how deal with all the obstacle from all this countries.
And the reason why we need this knowledge is because we are designing online and offline platform payment system that it will generate a decent new trend with micro payments in those countries.
That's why I'm spreading the word.
Thanks for the contributions guys !!!
