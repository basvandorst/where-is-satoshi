now I feel bad.
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:38:36
That's from everyone panic sending their coins to exchanges to sell them! My plan is working very well. Very well indeed.

@_date: 2014-12-17 19:43:12
Yes, just accept it. Sell your coins and accept it. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 10:51:45
Just doing my thang, bro!
@_date: 2015-01-12 10:18:42
Why do so many people hate bitcoin so much?
@_date: 2015-01-12 14:10:24
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:00:43
Well, the people who gave their own price all said over $10k or even more. So there's that. Not sure what to think of it.
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:55:03




HAHAHAHAHAHA! It's funny because the trolls here go HAIL BITCOIN as a joke, while that Garza guy uses it as an actual sales pitch. Just LOL.
@_date: 2015-01-12 19:02:52


Sure you can. With a bunch of buttcoiners. Welcome to @_date: 2015-01-12 11:40:24
I don't need some complicated analysis to see that it's going down!
@_date: 2015-01-12 11:59:41
No you're not allowed to rebuy ever again.
@_date: 2015-01-12 11:56:39
I don't believe you!
@_date: 2015-01-13 19:38:35
I didn't want to dilute the options too much. Think of it as being included in the "within 6 months" option :)
@_date: 2014-12-17 16:08:38
Not as long as I have something to say about it.
@_date: 2015-01-12 13:53:26
That's the impression I get, yes.
@_date: 2015-01-13 22:20:41
Hypothetical: It's December 2015 and Bitcoin is at $2000... are you going to wish you had bought more now, at $230?
@_date: 2015-01-12 12:09:22
Bitcoin didn't exactly excel at storing wealth lately.
@_date: 2015-01-12 12:31:07


Because now they're not at over $1000 but at less than $270?
I can understand why you didn't sell back then, thinking it would go even higher, but that's not the case anymore.
@_date: 2015-01-12 18:49:00
Maybe there's a place that sells mass downvotes for bitcoins...
@_date: 2015-01-12 18:43:36
No thanks.
@_date: 2015-01-12 18:55:15
How does pegging my bitcoins to USD protect me against USD inflation? 
I'm sorry that I don't care about your stupid nubits.
@_date: 2015-01-12 19:03:53
What? Where am I spreading any FUD?
@_date: 2015-01-12 12:04:21
But they're only worth $270 and maybe even less soon. And you got the chance to sell all your bitcoins now for a $400 price and then you're out of this forever! Isn't that a good deal?
@_date: 2015-04-21 12:53:22
Unfortunately though, most other people will also see failure. Because the failure is real, the potential is nothing more than wishful thinking and empty promises at this point.
@_date: 2015-04-08 19:11:55
Hey, just wanted to let you know that I figured out why your bids/asks calculation gets so close to the actual price. It's actually fucking simple: The normalized ratio would generally be close to 1, but because you didn't normalize it, it's off by a factor p = price. Forest for the trees...
@_date: 2015-04-21 10:35:01
@_date: 2015-04-08 15:21:48
Hahahaha! Buuuuuut... it would totally explain recent 180° turn.
@_date: 2015-04-21 11:04:11
Dude. I used to talk to people about bitcoin all the time, irl. These days, nobody gives a shit. Wake up.
@_date: 2015-04-21 14:58:35
Yes, in 10 years. But if it's boring now, something is seriously wrong with it.
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:28:12
Things have been happening for years already and it doesn't look like it's working at all.
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:38:00
[Is that so?](
@_date: 2015-04-05 15:36:23
Just believe me.
@_date: 2015-04-21 16:32:37


What a load of bullshit.
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:01:11
That's not how this works at all.
@_date: 2015-04-21 12:43:07
Struggling for weeks? How about plummeting for months on end?
@_date: 2015-04-21 15:08:41
And the sane people logic goes like this: If almost everyone who has bought bitcoins this year or last year has lost money, then it has in fact been going down non-stop. Now are you going to tell me that this isn't the case?
@_date: 2015-04-21 11:14:51
@_date: 2015-04-21 10:43:24
Quite an old episode already. But nothing has changed and it's still perfectly relevant.
@_date: 2015-04-21 15:31:26
LOL ok whatever.

@_date: 2015-04-05 15:12:18
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:02:51
I was just asking a question.
@_date: 2015-04-16 20:55:21
It's funny because it's true.
@_date: 2015-04-07 12:30:32
Okay guys, the plebs have sold their bitcoins. We can start operation Moonrise IV now.
@_date: 2015-04-21 14:23:13
@_date: 2015-04-21 14:12:56
I think you've got cause and effect mixed up here.
@_date: 2015-04-21 12:32:54
So funny how you all try to twist the words trying to make this look good, when it really is just sad. 42 whole bitcoins. In India with over a billion people. Sad.
@_date: 2015-04-21 10:50:26

If I had to pick one mod that I thought was the most incorruptible out of this subreddit, you'd have been the obvious choice (and maybe hardleft121). It's pretty clear to anyone who follows this sub closely. So maybe they didn't approach you exactly for that reason?
@_date: 2015-04-05 15:59:42
Yes, this is my answer to you, account made specifically to ask this question.
@_date: 2015-04-08 19:28:36
More like smoke and mirrors ware.
@_date: 2015-04-21 11:58:29
Infinitely more actually.
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:55:12
Oh ok. It's the online version of chronic bitch face then? Fair enough.
@_date: 2015-04-21 16:06:28
If almost everyone who has bought bitcoins this year or last year has lost money, then it has in fact been going down non-stop. Now are you going to tell me that this isn't the case?
@_date: 2015-04-21 10:14:38
That, and bitcoin has become boring. Everything about it has become boring. So boring in fact, that everyone is only talking about blockchain tech etc. Bitcoin is too boring to even talk about.
@_date: 2015-04-16 20:08:50
It's always gonna be next year. And then the year after that maybe. How long do you think people will believe this?
@_date: 2015-04-21 11:37:10
From nothing to more nothing. YAY BITCOIN!
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:34:30
It's not a straight line down and shorters risk getting caught in one of the short lived pumps and fakeouts. Still a lot of traders are doing this and they are making money. But this has nothing to do with OP, has it?
@_date: 2015-04-08 19:35:33
She needs to turn this into a rap song.
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:22:22
But last time I checked Bitcoin was leading the race to the bottom? Why would anyone put their money into this?
@_date: 2015-04-21 13:39:19


If only that was the case. The reality is that there is almost no growth in adoption and usage. And especially not in India. And you know why? Because people in India can not afford to see what little wealth they have evaporate. They look at bitcoin's price chart and that's the end of that.
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:40:21
@_date: 2015-04-16 20:05:09
They're celebrating $229 now. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 08:02:56
[LOL OP](
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:30:59
Of course. But one doesn't exclude the other.
@_date: 2015-04-22 10:42:55
@_date: 2015-04-22 07:51:31
@_date: 2015-04-05 16:23:59
@_date: 2015-04-17 12:31:50
Yeah, keep dreaming.
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:50:14
Do you always get so agitated over nothing? That's not good for your health, you know. Obviously noone in this thread is being serious. Well almost noone.
