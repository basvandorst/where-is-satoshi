I agree with you completely - the whitepaper is still the most accessible whitepaper out there and has played a critical role in explaining the basic concept to many many people. It is the only paper I recommend newbies read and they all come back with a much better understanding.

Must suck to have built something like Mt Gox for the bitcoin community and see it get run into the ground by a shitshow like Karpeles.

From what I hear from early bitcoiners, Mark the CEO of mt Gox is the one who royally screwed up mt. gox and the edonkey/gox guy is a legit coder.

Oh sorry, I meant in the Gox collapse. My bad.

Done. Also has anyone done an update to that demographic survey of bitcoin users that came out 2 years ago? Would be curious to see how it has changed.

This was posted in the thread that I made on the same topic by [Jesse Powell]( the CEO of Kraken. Key part: "Jed didn't have any special access or priority. I don't have any reason to believe that Jed was in any way involved in any malfeasance. From every interaction I've had with him, he's a smart, trustworthy guy."

But what does it mean if it fluctuates and drops below 80% over the time period needed to lock in?
