you'll be running a casino. When was the last time you heard of a casino owner hurting for cash?

Not necessarily, I don't think, Businesses can refuse any transaction they don't want to take, so they can refuse to take dollars if they wish.

You're understanding Public Key cryptography very well for someone new to the concept, for sure!
The simplest kind of message signing works like you described, with the signature being "decrypted" with the sender's private key so the receiver can "encrypt" the signature with the sender's public key to get the plaintext signature. The important thing to decide, though, is how the initial plaintext for your signature is created. You see, each *message's* signature must be unique and connected to only that message, as well as the sender, or anyone who sees a message you've signed before can fake your signature be copying the "decrypted" version, as it's already been verified to have run through your private key. Using a hash of the message itself as the plaintext for *only that message's* signature means that it's impossible to impersonate you without actually knowing your private key.

are you volunteering to make a new server? Because I want you to be volunteering to make a new server.

Given these circumstances, I'd urge everyone to at least look into cryopreservation for yourself. It can be pretty easily funded with life insurance, and I'd hate to hear of anyone *permanently* dying because they just never got around to signing up. [Alcor's]( site has a lot of useful information for those interested. I'd also recommend [this post]( which is what convinced me to investigate Cryonics myself.

I disagree. I personally got into Bitcoin because of the "fuck central banking" ideology they supposedly supported and only awhile later got into cryptography and the technology of it.
Now cryptography&gt;politics to me by a significant amount, but that's because of my love of Bitcoin, not the other way around.

last I heard the bitvegas server was basically dead though. It was awesome while it lasted, however.

To answer at least part of your question, no, the receiver never has to verify the desire to receive coins themselves. You could throw up a sign with your address on some site, and abandon your computer for decades, and still successfully receive coins into the balance of that wallet. For a transaction to be entered onto the Blockchain, the public record of all BTC transactions, requires only the signature of the sender and the address of the receiver.

"reversed stupidity is not intelligence. If the greatest fool in the world says the sun is shining, that doesn't make it dark out."
The government does *a lot* of stupid things, and Bitcoin does help avoid some regulations you'd otherwise encounter. But I want transparency/proof of effectiveness from nom-profits Im willing to donate to.

Thank you for my now much more glorious *29* cent balance!
(if I withdraw that. which I probably wont. tipping looks like more fun.)

Check out the [Bitcoins for Merchants]( section on WeUseCoins. There are several services mentioned there that make accepting Bitcoins simple.
I'm not sure how much you personally know about Bitcoins, so it's also important to understand exactly what your looking for in a payment provider. If you're just getting started with them, you'll likely just want something that offers Point-Of-Sale transactions, which lets someone pay you in Bitcoins, while letting you receive USD, using whatever is the current conversion rate.
You may eventually interested in accepting BTC directly, of course, but as of now not everything can be bought with 'em.
I'm glad to see more merchants taking an interest in BTC, and I hope you do well with your coin loving costumers.

One of the big motivating factors for me was the ability to very easily through money at internet strangers. I'm a big fan of spontaneous kindness, and bitcoin tipping is a very simple way to do that.
