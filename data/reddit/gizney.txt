Step 1. Build an electric car to make a better world.
Step 2. Now that your car is an electric one, put in a gas powered engine to make sure all the old manufacturers, shareholders and industry can participate.
I can't help but I don't see the difference here.

Definitely!

Do you need any further regulation for a loan besides the terms in your contract?
@_date: 2018-03-25 11:12:17
Yes of course, but for the 99% of us who never need a financial/business lawyer making difficult contracts for us...

Sure, no one knows what will happen. Institutions and people will stay rich if they care about their money, I guess.
As crypto is based on the internet I think its acceptance will develop even faster than the internet itself. In some african countries, people use their mobile phones credit as their bank account to buy everyday items, pay their rent and else. And thats happening since years already.
In the end, its all about trust I guess. 
Banks have a history of their businesses, double-entry accounting. The longer the history, the higher the trust.
As crypto aims (in my understanding) to disconnect trustworthiness from a "good" history, there will be a paradigm shift with banks.
I think the whole concept of crypto and blockchain is simply too big to end as some kind of "feature" for the current financial system.

Yes, or to many holders of small shares that unite to give you a loan. Without the need of building a large organisation or company overhead which takes out most of the profits!

Now that lightning seems to work (there are already videos of successful transactions on youtube)... just waiting to buy more bitcoin ��

Haha a reputation, like Lehman Brothers'?
I rather believe in a transparent and self controlled public blockchain than "a hundred years of financial trust".
Security funds can also be part of smart contracts. The idea of crypto and blockchain in general is to free the people from centralized control over their finances/lives. Of course a centrally controlled blockchain will be manipulated... and is therefore worthless.
Lets face it, banks and governments try to regulate crypto and are only interested in some kind of fake "blockchain" in order to keep their system alive. 
For me, there is no way to "embed" crypto and blockchain into the current financial system. The current tax and law system has to adapt, like had to adapt to the new rules the internet gave. Not vice versa.

It always depends on your local laws, there are countries which do not tax profits if you hold long enough.

Because some fraud call it the "original/real bitcoin" to make people mistake when they want to buy "Bitcoin".
Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is only a fork of the original Bitcoin (BTC).
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:28:34
It was forked to allow changes on the block size

Its too late, the idea of crypto describes decentral currency. So without any government needed to control it. Only an uncontrolled currency will sustain.
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:34:51
Also people are angry that bitcoin.com is used to propagate BCH as the real Bitcoin, which is a lie.

One thing I don't understand is where does he get the correct phone numbers from? Gmail and others always show something like "******46" als your Phone number.
