The future will probably be a mixture of decentralized exchanges (where the user controls the private key) vs. FDIC insured institutional exchanges like Gemini.  Both of which are much better than sending the equivalent of cash to random amateurs running a shoddy exchange in some other legal jurisdiction.

I don't want lawyers involved with the case but I feel someone deserves to be punished for lying about the multi-sig wallets.  Some "software security engineer" most likely received a nice paycheck for setting up "separated" hot-wallets that ended up being shit at best or a flat out sham at worst.   It wasn't a software bug that caused this...this is the way they designed it to run.

I feel bad for the liquidity providers.  Bitfinex tried to pitch it as being "low-risk" hah.
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:38:20
They were selling their service as "each client has their OWN multi-sig wallet." Furthermore many traders bought from elsewhere like Coinbase and Circle and only used Bitfinex for margin trading.  I wasn't providing Bitfinex "funds"...I was using their service for a fee.  How can they say bitcoins used in that way are their "funds"?  There will be a lawsuit if they try to empty the remaining wallets into a pooled one, rest assured.

implying you can't set a bot to monitor the addresses and report back if funds move.  Satoshi's coins are gaining on 10 years old and it would be front page news if even pennies worth were moved around.

The word-wide web has been around since 1993.  Usenet even longer.  People have been saying mean things to each other over the digital medium for at least 3 decades now.  Redditors consider themselves technologically inclined so they should be used to how the internet works by now.

@_date: 2016-08-03 16:02:49
lol trading has probably done more to make btc legitimate than merchant adoption anyways.  Whining for merchants to accept btc is annoying... and they end up dropping it after making $0-15 per year sales.   Its funny that you think bitcoin's success = people knowingly using it at stores.

Certificate "Authorities" aren't trustworthy.  Encryption is an afterthought on a majority of servers running.  The banking system cares so little about security that they willingly used magnetic strip technology (from the 1950's) right up until a government mandate forced them to start issuing chipped cards.  They dont give a shit about customer security.  The central "trust" are just an old boys club serving their own interests and every cog in their machine is a blessing.

if bitcoin achieves its endgame, it doesn't need an ETF.  there is nothing "sathoshian" about the ETF.  the real problem around here is the constant price circle-jerks, constant whining about coinbase's slow support, and overall pointless herd mentality posts asking "can we all just agree about ____?"   reddit has always been an echo-chamber but used to have a hell of a lot more actual technical discussions and creative input.
@_date: 2017-03-14 23:49:55

Nobody here is arguing that.  They are worried about the greedy IRS trying to get shekels from micro-transactions and wallet to wallet transfers and you are telling people the IRS can and will know EVERYTHING.

Yes you are a shill.  You are admittedly a CPA, and here you are pushing people into full compliance with fear tactics.  I'm sure it generates some nice fresh clientele for your company.
  To anyone else reading:  Just pay the stuff the IRS actually has the resources to prove...only tools would actually go back through 3.5 years of coffee transactions to make sure the IRS gets their "fair share" of shekels.  If you have a mess of cross-currency conversions to the point where its almost impossible to be compliant just make something up that is technically sound and pay that.  You will lose all of your gains trying to comply if you listen to and pay shills like this.

I saw Jihan at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

Ian from Debian, everything created by RMS, Brandon Eich with Javascript, etc  If you research open-source projects you will come to see that the creators often move on to new things.

well in this context it means they intentionally keep their bandwidth low, knowing it will crash the site when a big move happens.  they, being their own market makers can have enormous buywalls ready beforehand to profit off of those unable to close their positions.  when confronted they can play dumb and blame it all on the lack of bandwidth.  its a shit excuse though because bitcoin exchanges have astronomical fees in comparison to virtually every other market you can open an account and trade. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:52:36
keep in mind, these exchanges are charging WAY higher fees than any other markets.  they are sucking up your btc profits and can't even be bothered to keep their site online or respond to 20 day old support tickets.  not to mention the whole unexplained price movements even though users are totally locked out and stops/take-profits were completely ignored.

I think they go a little too far tracking bitcoin purchases.  I completely understand why they can't allow people to send btc from Coinbase -&gt; Known Illicit Service for obvious reasons. If it goes from Coinbase -&gt; Private Wallet Address they don't need to keep monitoring it because they are no longer liable.  But sometimes they still do. Why?  I am also a bit troubled by their patents.

You are full of shit (as usual) Bruce.  Coinbase is SUBSTANTIALLY more invasive than required by AML\KYC.  No other companies in the financial sector ask you those level of personal questions.  The bank doesn't give a fuck what I do with the $300 check I cash but Coinbase "has" to know what I am doing with the btc I purchase.  They are building a database of btc user info and transactions with the hope this data becomes marketable later.  Period.
