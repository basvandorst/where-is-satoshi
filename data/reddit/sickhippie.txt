This is a great way to be put in prison for life with multiple felonies.  Filing fraudulent liens tends to be frowned upon.

Maybe 100 deposits over 2 months in a non-business account?  That's shady as fuck.  Then pulling out all the funds after they tell him they're reviewing it?  OP is an idiot.

So, the article titled "Protocol Specification" that contains the specifications of the protocol isn't the protocol specifications?  Okay then...

That's exactly why.  Most people's practice with everyday decimals are in the hundredths.  To think in millionths takes some brain retraining that the average person finds pretty difficult.  Also, if a satoshi was the standard unit, it wouldn't be as interesting as an investment for those who do that sort of thing.  A unit of 1 whose value is several hundred is easier to work with than a unit of one that can only be cashed out in Zimbabwe dollars.

I see the tips, don't get me wrong - but I don't see the $5-$100 tips that I used to see back when it was "fun" money.  I've been a part of the bitcoin community from back when it was around $5/coin, and people behaved a LOT differently when it was plentiful and easy to acquire.  No one's going to try to take your fruit when they can pick one from the tree next to you, but if all the fruit is either taken by someone or requires a 30 foot climb with no ladder someone just might try to take your fruit.
I'm fully aware of how the monetary system works (that's a good video to watch, though, for anyone still reading this far down the thread), but my point is that ALL vital resources eventually become scarce, and as *any* desirable resource gets scarce, people revert to base greed - hoard what's mine and fight to keep it and acquire more.  This is doubly true for necessary resources - food, water, shelter, etc.
I would love for your vision to be realized, but I doubt it will happen on a global level in my or my children's lifetimes (barring a complete breakdown of Western civilization into disconnected communities).  I'm not sure if that's pessimism or realism, but history shows that greed overtakes goodwill in nearly every social setting and nearly every area of the world.

BTC-e suspended coin withdraws when BitStamp did.  As of this morning, they're working through the backlog of transactions, but they're also under a DDoS attack which could affect the mailserver (depending on their configuration).

Most people who don't own bitcoin see it as an investment vehicle, not a currency.  The price volatility doesn't help that impression.

"brings" is the key word there.  You can't bring what you don't have.  Money is far from the only difference between Burning Man and real life.  I mean, I like having "spiritual experiences" in the desert as much as the next hippie (just look at the username), but I'm not so lost that I think that closed-loop experience with abundance for everyone could ever be transformed into even a medium-scale long-term existence.  
Resource scarcity triggers instinctual behaviors.  Capitalism has frequently used that as a 'pain point' - think "Eat a Snickers.  You turn into Attila The Hun when you're hungry."  Let people get a little too hungry, angry, lonely, or tired, and people will become beasts.
As I said before, once a necessary resource becomes scarce, true nature comes in.  Hell, you can see it with Bitcoin over the history of the last few years.  When it was easy to mine and plentiful, people just gave it away by the thousands.  Now people hoard it and it's Serious Business because it's difficult to obtain.  People went from acting like the Dogecoin community (fun, welcoming, Magic Internet Money, etc) to being greedy, pretentious douchebags.
Remember, Burning Man is an *escape* from real life.  It is not a substitute for it, and it would be naive to think otherwise.

US resident here.  When I pull out my BTC (or any cryptocurrency) in one way or another - converting to fiat and withdrawing from an exchange, or by purchasing goods with a USD value - do I record the income as a standard capital gain for taxation purposes, or is there something more complicated?  Also, do I record the valuation at the time of the transaction, then compile it all at the end of the year for filing?
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:55:49
Pretty sure Bitcoin is a protocol, not a software.  Also pretty sure the software people are blaming is the custom implementation by MtGox.

Really?  A festival largely populated by the middle class on vacation and trust fund hippies on drugs convinced you that "true anarchy" is possible?  Without capitalism, that festival would be a ghost town - ticket price plus travel cost keeps out the "undesirables".
Any ideology can exist for a week or two given enough funds to take the "how to survive" stresses away.  Put that same group in the desert for a year with the same set of resources and you'd see a very different set of behaviors on display when you came back (if anyone was still alive, anyway).  True anarchy ceases to be peaceful and beautiful as soon as a desirable resource runs low.  That's when base human nature comes out to play (the *actual* "true anarchy").  Spoiler:  Lord of the Flies wasn't too far off.
Edit:  downvote away, people are animals and will act accordingly under stress.

WordPress isn't bad, honestly.  The weakest link is always the users.  Simple password with no limit on attempts set?  That's a hacked site, regardless of platform.
@_date: 2015-01-01 09:14:43
Glad to hear it!  I'm a WordPress dev, and can't stand it when people blame the platform.  With the exception of the TimThumb vulnerability years back, almost every time I hear about a hacked WP site it's an outdated version.  The rest are password issues, and password security vs user laziness is an IT battle almost as old as computers themselves.

No, that's fair, especially on the admin URL piece.  That said, it's still on par with any other large-scale CMS that I've run into.  There's a balance between usability and functionality that they all try to achieve, and when you consider the average content creator (usually in Marketing, Sales, or some other non-IT department), ease of use becomes a priority - and WordPress shines there.  It's a fine line to walk, to be sure, but the alternatives aren't better in the security department and significantly worse in the ease-of-use department.

As long as customers pay in cash, a business will need to have cash on hand.  They'll need to have change, petty cash, etc, ready to go, and at the end of the day/week, they'll have to put that cash someplace.  It's easy for someone who's already behind crypto to point to it as a solution, but it doesn't solve the problem from the company's perspective - what to do with the physical cash their customers keep handing them?
If you can't deposit your fiat in a bank, how do you turn the fiat into digital currency?  Your options are suddenly limited to sending off a cashier's check off to an exchange or buying in person (either from a person or from an ATM).  Both of those add a huge amount of hassle and overhead, then on top of it converting back from bitcoin to fiat for the cash on hand that's needed to pay bills and such?  Yeah, that's a logistics NIGHTMARE for a small business owner who even knows what bitcoin is.  If they don't, then you've got a steep learning curve on top of that.  Security guards and armored cars look much better, if only because it's a known solution and insured security for the cash.
@_date: 2015-02-12 04:19:22
So, in a new exploding industry that's already saturated with competition in the major cities where it's legal, you want to add a hoop for the customer to jump through and make it more difficult to pay your daily/weekly/monthly expenses to boot?
'Hacking together a solution' is great for parts of business, but not when it involves the primary thing that keeps your business going.
@_date: 2015-02-12 04:59:57
Yes, I see that you mentioned it.  Presenting a non-viable option isn't really a great thing though, unless you really wanted to underscore how much bitcoin is NOT for these business owners.  I mean, it's not crazy to think there's a new non-viable option for running your business.  Bad ideas happen all the time.
That said, I would be thrilled it bitcoin actually WERE a viable option.  The hard reality is, until it's seen as inherently valuable in itself (separate from an external currency), it won't see that streamlining because it won't be a functional currency for all aspects of a business.

Credit unions, as non-profit entities, tend to not be focused on profit.  It's very helpful for keeping fees down.
