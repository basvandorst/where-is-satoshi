This is another bad thing here, if u want to compare with BCH than compare with the tech, we all need to grow up. The world can have two functional coins.

How much is the transaction fees for a 1$ transaction?

U r using it for a specific purpose, that is not what Bitcoin is, or was, cause lately ppl just seem to be changing it's use case. Bitcoin was supposed to be people's digital cash, transparent, cheap, convenient.
Who gives a shit if it cost only 2 $ to move 10-20-30 or 50 million dollars? But it becomes a big issue if it takes more than 10 seconds to transfer and more than 0.01% of the transacting amount. Because why the fk will someone use bitcoin than.
In a third world country like India, u have innovations like UPI. UPI, basically type someone's mobile number  (or a custom username like identifier) and the money is transferred instantaneously at 0 fee. And due to it being digital it also keeps track of the money. So now tell me, how can bitcoin compete with that?

This sub is the one that keeps selling the hodl, moon and Lambo bs. It's people who actually use crypto in day to day life that will change it. And also only users know the issues with slow transaction and high fees

These posts are getting cringey. I really hope we can have more valuable posts that can show the value of BTC rather than just Moon and Lambo

I had unsubbed for this exact reason, but I resubscribe once in a while to see where the tech is.

Two paths, both have advantages and disadvantages and fan boys who hold both coins but would never accept that they do. Just do your own research and make your mind, it will keep you calm if the market dips.

Well no shit, r/btc sees segwit as a solution to a problem that doesn't need to exist, of course they are not gonna show the same level of excitement as r/bitcoin.

They banned exchanges because taxes weren't paid. That's it, they are actually positive on blockchain.

Isn't bitcoin a currency too?

I don't care which side u r on, but what Twitter did is u acceptable.

A government backed coin won't be a shitcoin though.

Indian RBI bans buying and selling bitcoin.
Officers: Adapt, Improvise, Overcome.

It wasn't advertised because the big money is already involved and they are scooping up every machine out there.
