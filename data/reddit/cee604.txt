The run up to $100k by end of 2018 gents and ladies!! 
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:47:34
The dick eating charts are off the scale! To the moon! 
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:06:45
All things considered, how unsafe truly is this practice? I mean, what are the realistic chances of compromise from just generating a paper wallet and encryption with BIP38 on an internet connected PC?
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:19:47
Bitcoin all the way, it's going mainstream and will explode upwards in a big way with the CME and Wallstreet exposure coming it's way. I see it doubling in a month or two. Projected end if 2018 price around $50,000.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:23:57
Everyone calm down and watch an Andreas Antonopoulos video on YouTube. 
I find it calms the FUD.
Keep buying and be merry.

Actually, there's a condo developer here in Vancouver, BC that recently started accepting Bitcoin as a downpayment for a unit.....
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:16:12
Thanks for the response, I feel a little more secure about it all now.
Yeah, it's insane, the price movement even this month alone!
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:54:29
I sure like the sound of that!
I'm thinking of redirecting my booze and coffee expenditures toward making dollar cost averaging purchase of Bitcoin over time.  I believe down the road my wallet and liver will thank me  ��

Man, is that guy still spewing the same narratives? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:25:04
Are we just at the beginning here, or bubble territory?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:16:07
Thanks will do! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:27:58
Price discovery, FOMO, market mania, financial revolution on a global scale. All of the above. 
Grab some popcorn.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:35:06
So if you have positions in Bitcoin classic, fear not. And if you have positions in Bitcoin cash, fear not also?
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:55:57
I'm secretly hoping for a crash tonthose levels, so I can stack and HODL. 
Trust in the fundamentals - Bitcoin is here to stay .
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:31:44
Then what is it, and is it a viable investment nonetheless? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:54:54
What makes you say that, without any supporting facts or self research? 
If one were to truly understand Bitcoin and it's true potential, I think we haven't even begun to see the new heights we are about to reach. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:12:37
Thanks for the info, I'll look in to this. Not that I'm looking to get off the rocket ATM !
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:53:19
Thanks very much for your insight.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:18:10
Easily , given the advantages this has over gold alone.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:41:25
Bring it on :)
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:19:21
Man, as of this writing, did it ever explode on the upside or what!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:57:51
Through a Bitcoin ATM?? Like where would one go?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:47:24
But I trust Bitcoin in the long term will do what it was designed to do, keep money honest...
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:17:03
Ugh looks like Gemini isn't available in Canada.. :/ 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:06:04
Peanuts. I think $1 Million is a very real goal.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:30:56
Paper wallet, physical hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger Nano S.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:29:35
This can't be normal or sustainable. Unless it is? Wtf is going on y'all!!
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:03:07
Also, check out this well layed out past Reddit post.
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:12:30
Do we not need to resolve its scalability and txn fee issues first, before it is embraced by the mainstream and thus enjoy the lofty bullish prices being thrown around these days? Just a thought. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:31:18
Mt Gox. Google it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:24:48
Can you expand a little more on this and why you think it plummets from here?? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:57:17
Lol the pleasure is mine, sir.  I literally want to take a pic of this as my first bitcoin transaction ever and frame it on my wall ����
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:03:42
I trust governments won't be able to legislate their way in to controlling something that is decentralized like Bitcoin; hence, you have countries like Japan making it legal tender.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:18:05
 here's some opinion on that 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:46:37
So hold the course for Bitcoin classic? I am so confused right now with what's going on.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:16:02
2014 article. 
Japan made Bitcoin legal tender recently. Paradigm is shifting quickly for sure.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:58:52
Well, I'll be putting half my nest egg in this movement.
What's the best security measure for this, I hear Trezor is the go to?
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:37:35
$12,600 now ;) 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:29:46
Actually, quite possible... 
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:27:52
You, sir, are a gentleman and a scholar.  Thank you ��
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:10:23
WALL STREET
There has been no solution for large financial fiduciaries to invest in Bitcoin. This changed November 2017.
LedgerX, whose CEO I interviewed 23 March 2013, began trading as a CFTC regulated Swap Execution Facility and Derivatives Clearing Organization.
The CME Group announced they will begin trading in Q4 2017 Bitcoin futures.
The CBOE announced they will begin trading Bitcoin futures soon.
By analogy, these institutional products are like connecting a major metropolis's water system (US$90.4T and US$2 quadrillion) via a nanoscopic shunt to a tiny blueberry ($150B) that is infinitely expandable.
This price discovery could be the most wild thing anyone has ever experienced in financial markets.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:09:14
Wasn't that resolved with off chain processing? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:05:35
It's definitely a psychological milestone, to break the $10k mark.
One that might begin drawing more mainstream attention, but nowhere near where I think it'll go.
$100k Bitcoin here we come!! 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:36:52
Read some of these articles already, pretty cut throat action from their camp. I was concerned for a while there.  So long term, Bitcoin classic should be good and around as an investment?
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:13:52
Check out a fella by the name of Andreas Antonopoulos on YouTube. His videos are clear, and he is an absolute genius in this realm. 
I educated myself on the subject matter mostly by binge watching from his channel.
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:06:38
And the meek shall inherit the earth.  Eat it, greedy bankers. Eat it, slave driver Central Banks of the world. We coming for you, we coming for our freedom back. And we coming for our honest money. To the moon my friends. To the moon. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:01:53
We'll check out this visual and have a look see.at the derivatives chart. It's scary. But, where does that value go when it all collapses ... ;) 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:56:11
Agree. Like Andreas Said, think of Bitcoin as the internet pre 1993.  
No way we could imagined its effect on the world today. No way to measure it.  
Bitcoin will change humanity in ways we can only imagine. 
Keep HODLING friends.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:54:03
Good to know, thanks! 
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:14:52
Cool, I shall try those.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:54:27
Thanks for the info, I was getting a bit concerned this would be a trend. 
What is the strategy here if that's the case, wait it out till the dust settles? I am assuming lower fees soon as the manipulation is over?
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:38:37
Exactly this. And a lot of smart money is transitioning to this space.  
Time will only tell, but I'm very bullish :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:25:10
Oh boy, here.we.go.
@_date: 2017-11-09 08:56:15
But lots of wallstreet types are jumping in, does that not signal some sort of paradigm shift in the markets?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:08:31
It's an interesting development that signals to me mainstream adoption...
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:26:23
Not yet it don't..
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:04:22
Here's an excellent piece to perhaps answer some of your questions.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:16:37
Agree. Fellow HODL er here ;)
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:02:01
Nope. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:39:25
Early retirement for me by then, if the crypto gods have their way ;) 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:08:34
There is finite gold and yet the gold market is $7 Trillion. Bitcoin can potentially capture 1/4 of that market.  Any mathematics majors wanna take a stab at Bitcoin values soon as that happens? ;) 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:03:47
Boom ;)
@_date: 2019-04-02 06:37:33
When, precisely,  is the next halving?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:45:05
By that same token, people aren't going to wait 5+ years to lose more fiat value due to inflation brought on by central banks who do what they wish with the currency.
@_date: 2019-04-02 06:33:15
Queue the plethora of BTC and when Lamborghini memes coming our way...
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:07:42
Yeah apparently! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:22:45
Add institutional money in to price discovery and the resulting mainstream attention. 
There are two ways to look at Bitcoin at this point. Either you get on the train, or stand in front of it. 
Mark my words. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:22:49
Cheers, thanks for the info
@_date: 2019-01-26 00:37:22
That just turned in to the new Bitcoin pizza meal. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:45:08
Is the Lightening Network upgrade yet another fork, is this basically a re-tuning of the engine so to say? 
I guess what I mean by that is, is this something that will be some sort of seamless overnight upgrade that we as Bitcoin HODLers wake up to one day?
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:53:59
Sweet tnx 
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:35:02
This movie actually looks epic. What's the original film title? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:55:20
Definitely cringe worthy shilling at its finest.
 Having said that, I do agree that blockchain technology is revolutionary stuff.  We'll be seeing some pretty cool applications in the not too distant future.  I wouldn't bet against some sort of wide spread adoption of crypto as currency, be it bitcoin or similar tech. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:55:51
Ah got it. Sounds bullish then :)
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:12:46
So will this be like a default feature or will it be a little trickier to use?
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:08:32
I made money by buying the dip.
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:00:17
If you took the time to actually research blockchain technology and have some working knowledge of cryptos, there would be some substance to what he is saying. Minus the stupid shilling for his course which I agree is annoying.
Start with Andreas Antonopoulos on YouTube.
