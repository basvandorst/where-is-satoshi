The struggle is real. Imagine trying to explain to D&amp;D players 30 years ago what WoW would be like. They just would not get it. You would have run into the same resistance, because people just refuse to open their minds. In fact people will fight to keep them closed.

Signed up, it looks great. The future of Bitcoin is so bright.
You guys did not ask, but I am going to give you my 0.000005717 BTC.
I know what you guys mean by 'trustless' but it's not a very confidence inspiring word. Not trying to be critical, but from a conversion stance, there might not be a worst word to put on your page. The synonyms for trustless are like the top 50 for conversion words to avoid.
Perhaps Trust Not Needed, or No Trust Required". Maybe somthing about eliminating the need for a third party or cut out the middle man.

I think the point would be to bring ZeroCoin or any other alt coin tech and features to Bitcoin via a parallel block chain. So you would have the privacy of ZeroCoin but with bitcoin. Please correct me if I am wrong.

In 1993 you could have said the average person is neither interested in or capable of micro blogging, or instantaneous communication with millions of people around the world. Nor would people be interested in reading the opinions of strangers/laypersons, or viewing pictures of cats. In 1903 the average person was neither interested in or capable of driving a car. Maybe you see where I am going with this

If technical analysts can predict the future of any market, these guys would all be billionaires chillin on the beach, not lurking reddit.
