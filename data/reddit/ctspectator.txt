It’s very frustrating when they don’t give you a transaction ID or anything, or an email that it was send confirming the address, so you’re just sitting on your hands hoping something happens. Anyways, hopefully they get their act together because it is a good service, but I’m in the process of getting confirmed on Bitstamp and Gemini now. Bitstamp has free withdraws, too, and Segwit addresses. Good luck!

No fee for withdraws on GDAX! You’re good to go!

I started to try to get into it last night, got the Core wallet downloading on a new pc, made a github account, downloaded Git. I have absolutely no programming background, so this is all very confusing even reading the tutorials. I want to try to run a Lightning node, get the Zap Wallet going and do my transaction, but I’ve got many hours of research ahead of me. I was searching for tutorials, but they seemed pretty advanced, but I made an account on the Slack channel, so if I get really stuck I’ll ask my questions there. The work from Lightning is really inspiring and I would love to be involved some day helping others get this going once I figure it out myself.

Usually withdraws from GDAX are quick, like ~1 hr roughly. Yesterday I withdrew and it was confirmed in the first block after, so ten minutes. You don’t have the option to choose a fee, as they pay it on their end. Sometimes it can take longer, but mempool is clearing so just keep refreshing your binance. But, to answer your question though, yes, with a higher fee, the better chance it makes it into the next block.

That’s a Bitcoin.com wallet. It’s a scam wallet from Roger Ver and co. You should sue.

Sell 3, pay off my bills, hold for the long haul. This is moonin’, sugar.

But the PAY token doesn’t have a function, at least not yet.  *i mean it doesn’t serve a purpose in relation to their card as far as I know, yet.

Roger Ver promised I could buy a pack of gum with my Bitcoin. He’s a liar!

This season has been the most consistently laugh out loud funny so far, at least for me, although we are only three episodes in.

Also mentioned on Homeland! Darwin loves Bitcoin.

It's taken up to a 6 hours for me before. Sometimes it's working 5 minutes, sometimes it is hours.
