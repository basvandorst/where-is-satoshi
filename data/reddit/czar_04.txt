Damn, I should have just used Abra. Does it take long to have access to your bitcoins? 
The square cash app is actually very good but since its the first BTC purchase I've made I have to wait 24-72hr before I can use it (verifying/processing).

Wait idk how that works if I buy through paypal, I would need to buy using a BTC wallet I thought. Sorry, I haven't had much experience with bitcoin other than coinbase which was easy since I just used my debit card and went straight to my coinbase.
Can you explain how we would do this? You can PM me if you want

I don't prefer coinbase really, its just what I have already. Which app should I use? The one "MusicalGold" recommended (square cash) seems good. I could download that if it makes it easier

I'm all good now. The processing wait for Cash app was actually quicker than I was expecting (under 24hr). I'm just transferring any BTC I buy on Cash app to my coinbase account so I can use for purchases. I also downloaded BitPay &amp; Abra which I'm going to try out also

Awesome, I just googled it and that looks perfect. I can use my debit card to buy right?

Nice. Would it be instant? The only BTC wallet I have so far is CoinBase, which is the app I used to use before my bank stopped allowing it. 
Would I be able to use coinbase if I buy from you?

Thank you for recommending that, it seems like perfect wallet for my situation but for some reason it keeps saying "transfer failed" whenever I try to put $ on it from my debit card. 
I added my bank debit card correctly and everything, and I signed up for the cash app debit card so I really don't know why its not working. 
Do you have any suggestions? Anything I might be missing? 
Thanks

I'm all good now. If anyone else is in this situation; I'd recommend Cash app (from SquareCash) for buying bitcoin (no fees) then transfer it to another bitcoin wallet, (like CoinBase) if you want to make online purchases. For whatever reason I was not able to send exact BTC amounts through Cash app. Also, my bank didn't stop/decline my bitcoin purchase from Cash app, so I didn't have to use BlueBird, but they do apparently take AMEX so BlueBird is an option if needed. So, Cash app is great for buying BTC, you just need another wallet to use if making purchases

I was about to open an Abra bitcoin wallet because it apparently allows you to use BlueBird but I read some bad stuff on here about it and now I'm having second thoughts; hence this post. 
So, if anyone has had good experience using Abra I'd like to know please. 
Thanks
