You probably couldn't get 40 million out of bitcoins if you sold every one of them.
But it would make sense for the current miners to capture wallets that they think people have lost.  The miners could implement a system that says that if a wallet isn't refreshed every 3 years then the bitcoins are redistributed to the miners

5 dollars will still be pretty high.

People don't really want a ton of diversification in their life.  They will only dump bitcoin if bitcoin fails
My guess is that a currency that acts more like fiat money would eventually supplant bitcoin.  The people who want to use it as a currency and not a store of wealth will jump on something that has reliable and predictable inflation.

Bitcoin mining might even be more profitable than spamming.

If they have access to your computer they just access your stuff after you have authenticated.

Calling the people who disagree with you arrogant, ignorant, heartless, absurd, awful, and retarded isn't very nice.

The OP forgot the step of seizing control of enough of the mining clients to prevent them from conspiring to steal your bitcoins.
