I have never heard of QuadrigaCX wallet, but when I use the BTC Core wallet, Dash wallet, basically any of the core wallets, it allows me to check mark "include fee with transaction" which is what I usually do.  I would suggest looking around on that wallet to see if you have that option but I can see that they may not have it because if you ever use an exchange like Bittrex for example, when you withdrawal, they take the fee from the amount you specify.  My only concern with your wallet not being able to specify the fee would be to make sure that you are not sending during a peak time when the mempool is high as it could possibly add a large fee without you knowing.  However, it could also just keep a standard fee and this could also be bad as it could take a long time to get confirmed if it is too low. 
Hope this helps and God Bless!

There is always a fee to be paid as the miners get paid to add your transaction to the block chain.  It may not have been stated in you QuadrigaCX wallet, but if you have no fee, you will have to wait forever for it to get confirmed as there are currently 60,000 unconfirmed transactions:
In you case, you sent 0.01 - 0.0098152 (Amount you are seeing) = .0001848 (Transaction fee) X $10,500 (Approximate price of BTC) = $1.94 transaction fee.  That is not that bad of a fee.  Read up on high fees with BTC and you will see people paying $10+ even $100+ fees to get a transaction added to the block chain quickly.  
Hope this helps...God Bless!
