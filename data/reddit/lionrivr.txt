Could be. 
Bitcoin’s last downturn from $7,500 could have been partly because of the Bitcoin Cash pump as well.
Either way, trade smartly and emotionlessly.
If anything, eventually, the resistance at 10-11k could possibly even be the support level in the near future.

Not trying to spread FUD or be pessimistic, but the last resistance that Bitcoin faced before shooting past $10k was at around $7,500.
I don’t believe TA is a crystal ball, but it says a lot about the psychology behind the market and I believe we could be testing $7,500 as support in the next few months.
Prepare and don’t let emotions get the best of you. 
Hopefully, you all bought in with money that you can afford to lose.
Good luck to everyone.

I think that sports and any competitive activity can bring people together and make for good chances for bonding and for relationships to grow.
Why do you think some big companies get box seats and free tickets. Why do you think a lot of people go on dates at sporting events. It’s definitely not just a time suck. 
Why do you think high school kids who don’t play go to high school football games on a friday night. And lots of parents and family support it. Entire cities go to see their team play and support. It’s not just the people who play.
OLYMPICS bro. Entire fucking countries watch and support and cheer on their favorites. 
Watching people play video games sounds ridiculous  to me, but shit, man, different strokes for different folks. Whatever float your boat man. It probably has the same effect of community for them in their own weird way lol. 
DISCLAIMER: I don’t play sports as much as I did when I was young, nor do I actively watch/support any teams right now. But I’m definitely not too shortsighted to see the aspect of camaraderie and pride that sports can bring to a community.

If you had
One shot
Or one cryptocurrency
To shoot to the moon and land on it
In one wallet
Would You hodl it?
Or sell when it dips?
His bags are heavy, hands weak, losses plenty,
the losses on his record already: he HODL’s steady
He’s nervous, but it’s worth it, limit orders ready,
To stop walls, from whales, doing all the selling, 
Losing hope now, but no doubt, he Holds his ground
He opens his account, it’s low and going down
His tokens. Ouch, all his friends are jokin now
hair all fell out, scalp lookin like his whole account.
His stack’s scrapped, and it practically FALLS, 
like its gravity, OMG’s a tragedy, OH, he’s so mad, but he WONT sell it that easy, NO 
He wont have it, he KNOWS his whole stack’s gettin LOW.
It dont matter, he’s BROKE , he knows that, and he WONT
FOMO back, but he knows when he goes back, to his home he loaned, that’s when it’s back to the charts again yo, this whole fantasy, better go blast to the moon and hope it dont leave him
You better not Lose or sell, dont be stupid, you own it, Just Hold it, you better never let it go
You get only one shot, to the moon, thats the goal
This opportunity comes, once in a lifetime

Yes :) thank you. 
I have the whole song written, and am waiting til I have time to record it. 
It took forever, but almost everything rhymes with Eminem’s original song. 
I can record the song easily, I just wish I had the resources to make a dope music video for YouTube.
