Too many people don't understand basic concepts.  
Crypto-mania is an obvious scam. 
I bought in at $1,850 a btc and was called a fool and idiot. 
I thought I was onto something when it went to 2700 and I put a bit more $ fiat in. Friends and family said I was stupid for that too. At
 5500 I put in more fiat. Again a bit at 7500 and 9600. Then at 15000. I put some fiat in at 17000 and now I see I was a fool! This scam just worked out for me, but since it is no longer mooning, everyone was right! Crypto is a big scam... ��
Giving up on this crapshoot and working on a use case for crypto utility... any clues on how to cobble together my use case scenario? Needed: great coders. Legal assistance to stay on the right side of the law. Accounting assistance so I can pay some god awful gains taxes on this stupid investment and stay out of jail! Will not even mention my idiotic foray into mining... that scam is paying out at rates that are stupid too and will put this fool onto a higher tax bracket. This scam is for idiots... any takers?  
Side effects of this scam include: loss of sleep - waking and checking the markets like a dope addict on a binge! 
Nobody in my social circles wants to hear about things I learn - curiosity and this 'market' are a wonderland of opportunities and and adventure that makes me feel like a person who sees the 'Magic ' but I am surrounded by Muggles who are blind.
I got into this by use-case, not speculation or get rich quick ( i despise those types of characters! ) 
The scam is getting into anything for a quick buck... I scammed myself, but am working on easing out and putting all efforts into use-case implementation - believe that that is what builds the value - not unsustainable speculation that will give more fodder to the crypto-naysayers. This shit will eliminate financial friction and can bring about a lot of good. All the best!
