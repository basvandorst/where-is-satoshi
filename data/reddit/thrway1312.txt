sorry for your loss, painful life lesson on FOMO mentality

The stock market, while driven by human emotions, is backed by business fundamentals; bitcoin is backed by the premise that it's able to effectively replace currency (false due to poor scalability causing high transaction fees) without relying on a central banking organization.
They're both investing into concepts, but one is based on the success of a business (stocks) while the other is based on the (semi-)widespread adoption of a currency backed by no entities, or more specifically, whose value is completely dictated by the market with no fundamental value driving its price.
A company can be over- or under-valued based on its fundamental operations; BTC is worth exactly as much as someone is willing to pay for it, and the price today in no way reflects what the price will be in a day, week, month, year, etc. The same issue exists with government-issued fiats but those are backed by the government themself; BTC has no such risk mitigation.
tl;dr they're basically the same with the caveat that BTC is a shell whereas stocks represent something that actually generates (or not, based on the company's fundamentals) wealth.

Most markets are backed by something generating wealth; BTC is backed by the premise of anonymous currency which it's failing to deliver on due to high transaction fees.
AKA most markets are ~90% human emotions, BTC is 100% human emotions.
