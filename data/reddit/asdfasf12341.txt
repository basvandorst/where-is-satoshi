why even declare an HQ? better to just have an anonymous website. If you're not going to use the company for banking then what do you need a company for? If you are going to use it for banking then you want it in the US/EU.

 "Upload scanned copies of the required documents and receive a Formal Passport" -- doesn't sound 'highly anonymous' :p
webmoney supports bitcoin in the form of their WMX token.. you can exchange it here I think;  and it's possible to withdraw the WMX back to real blockchain btc too afaik.

I'm guessing that Gerald Cotten doesn't exist. He didn't need to exist as Quadriga never had it's own bank accounts, so didn't have to pass KYC at a bank. The government doesn't check the identities of company directors, so you can easily form a company using fake names. The main reason people don't normally do this, is that normally a company with no bank accounts is useless. Gerald only needs to exist as a 'dead guy' who can be blamed to divert blame away from the actual perps.

would also be good to see if he has a passport or driving license.

sometimes yes, sometimes you get your bank account closed and they keep your money.

would be nice if bitstamp officially denied it, but it's given similar complaints in the past, I'm inclined to believe they really did ask this.
@_date: 2019-04-11 19:13:25
I dunno.. for three characters of similarity they probably just guess a few thousand times and pick the best one?

Well.. what would the recipient do with cryptoUSD? I mean if they're happy to hold it great, but I guess they can't withdraw it to local currency without selling it on a local crypto exchange. This does get you back to one currency conversion instead of two.. but on the other hand there will probably be fees on a cryptoexchange for the sender getting from USD to cryptoUSD.
I think what happens is that at some point everyone has a bitcoin exchange account and even if it isn't an optimal way to receive foreign funds it might just be more familiar/easier than say opening some new fx trading account.. so it starts to become the way people do one off transactions with people they don't normally deal with.. just because you know crypto will always work it's easier than checking to see what else might be possible.
@_date: 2019-05-27 18:05:52
It's possible, but in practice it doesn't usually make sense. You have two transactions blah -&gt; BTC and BTC -&gt; blah.. two sets of fees to pay.. then there's the fact that currency trading sites generally have a much better relationship with banks than bitcoin exchanges and often charge lower fees than bitcoin exchange deposit/withdrawal fees.. in short - it's usually easier, cheaper and faster to use a currency trading site.
There are probably still some edge cases where it makes sense.. with exotic currencies that the main fx trading sites don't deal in or can't actually deliver (often they might offer trading/hedging, but no actual withdrawal capability), and with countries that are under sanctions.

revolut disallowed transfers to kraken.. but bitstamp works.
@_date: 2019-05-27 20:55:24
no clue what you're talking about.
@_date: 2019-05-31 20:59:42
yea.. so you can now have wifi at home, but noone has any internet access other than via govt wifi accesspoints - so really what was legalized here is wifi extenders so that people who live near enough an access point don't need to go to the park anymore (if their accesspoint at home can reach a govt one -if not then it makes no difference to them since they can't do anything useful with wifi anyway).. but they still need to pay for their internet using the $2/hr wifi cards (to get access to the govt access point that has internet) that are rationed and expensive anyway.

not until peter venesses drops his claim.

eh. seemed fine.. and interesting talk.
One thing I might not have understood correctly.. but I'm not convinced about the unsigned share submissions in betterhash.. just because there's a signed message on login doesn't mean the session can't be mitm'd after that.

Does it exist in the United Kingdom?
@_date: 2019-05-08 18:24:54
maybe open an account with  -- it's another online bank app like revolut.. it doesn't block transfers to kraken.. another option is  -- they are probably the worst bank in the world, but they do work for SEPA'ing funds to kraken.

@_date: 2019-05-31 21:04:48
nobody has a wired connection except for govt offices and maybe some large companies. everyone else just uses wifi at govt wifi hotspots mostly located in parks. what was legalized here is the common practice of people living near those parks using a wifi extender to extend the govt wifi singal into their house so they don't have to go outside to use it. they still need to pay for internet using the $2/hr govt issued scratch cards to access the govt wifi though.

but what about the time in between the 10 minute updates? I think you're better off just hitting reload as fast as possible.
@_date: 2019-05-25 21:49:34
found this;  -- might work on some devices.. otherwise maybe you could just break it open and attach your own power wires.. or possibly to the battery if it has a removable one.
edit:  this device claims to do it for some models.

for onchain scaling there's sidechains.. there's pretty much no chance of the main chain scaling anytime soon.
