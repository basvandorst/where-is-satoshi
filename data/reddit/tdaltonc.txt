I don't understand your first point. Wouldn't the buyer and seller still have to wait for the transaction to clear? How would the seller know that I have sufficient funds if we don't wait for a block containing our transaction to be mined?
Note: I am totally prepared to be told that I have this completely wrong. 
Edit: Thank you everyone for the thoughtful, polite explanations.

I feel like the overlap of "people Using ABP" and "People into BitCoin" has got to be substantial. I'm not sure if many people are going to see this.

Yep, my bad.

Ok, but why would Nasdaq run what's outlined in the article over bitcoins blockchain? It seems to me that they're going to set up a system that is totally independent of bitcoin. If they were using bitcoin, you'd think they'd mention it. But they didn't. They just said it will use a blockchain. 
EDIT: I was wrong. They're using OAP built on bitcoin:

I don't see any evidence that this will use the **bitcoin** blockchain. It looks like they're making a alternative technology based off of blockchain tech. That tells me that this makes bitcoin weaker.
EDIT: nope they're using OAP built on bitcoin:  
@_date: 2015-05-11 20:45:46
It's not clear that this is even using bitcoin. It looks like they're building their own blockchain based system. 
EDIT: nope they're using OAP built on bitcoin:

So my twitter bots can tweet sponsored links at other twitter bots? Well that will certainly take fewer AWS credits then actually mining bitcoin.

A lot of people were moving in to that market to take advantage of the split. Now that's not happening so . . .

I think that all of the "buy-and-hold" advice is super shallow. 
Build a service on top of bitcoin. As you implied, cross border payments using bitcoin are going to be big. Find a niche, fill it, and grow from there. Maybe a remittence platform for Hungarian nationals working abroad? I haven't heard of anyone doing "Send money to your college student child in the US" on bitcoin, so that could be a good niche. 
tldr: don't mine; don't buy-and-hold; build a service that fulfills some of what bitcoin can be.

In the Dot-com bubble, tech stocks were overvalued, in the Housing bubble home loan derivatives were over valued, so what is over valued right now? What are you shorting?

Someone made a company that does nothing but own bitcoin. You can buy and sell shares in that company. The price of the company should exactly tract the price of it's only asset (bitcoin).

But it's a tragedy of the commons problem. As a group there's an incentive to keep it classy but for an individual the incentive is to let someone else worry about it.

Most economists would make the exact opposite argument. High inflation (low deflation) encourages spending because people want to exchange an inflating currency for durable goods. The higher deflation goes, the more people will hoard, further increasing deflation.

I think it's a good bet. Odd's are bitcoin will flop, but if it succeeds it will succeed BIG. Cryptographic currency is a great idea, that doesn't mean bitcoin will stick around.

Part of decentralization means that individuals and groups have the right to make islands of order that agree to abide by common rules. You don't get to force your anarchy on them or the exchange they own/run. And they don't get to impose their order on you. 
You don't like their rules? Don't use their exchange.

If you ask yourself the question, "Should I store value in X?" then the idea that the largest military on early can be mobilized to defend the value stored in X is a plus for X as a store of value.
