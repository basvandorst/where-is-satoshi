Thanks for the advertisement Mr President

Erik, what happened to your brother Jason?
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:59:17
I don't think it can. Too many coins are lost somewhere
@_date: 2018-09-03 14:36:42
Yes, when it's the winter in Australia, it's the summer in the west 
@_date: 2018-09-02 11:54:09
It's a shitcoin, worth Singaporean dollars 
@_date: 2018-08-05 06:17:31
Looks more like a Ferrari to me 
@_date: 2018-08-21 10:11:18
All the cryptos are so stable right now that we could print them
@_date: 2018-08-11 12:24:38
Down 60
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:55:33
BGC? 
@_date: 2018-06-18 14:29:42
The new logo looks like a Skittle 
@_date: 2018-06-09 15:49:06
Yolo World? Really? 
@_date: 2018-06-04 16:32:20
They're trying to put more confusion in noob minds with that name though
@_date: 2018-06-04 16:06:31
Another fork? 
@_date: 2018-06-21 04:03:04
You should out QR codes so people can give you donations for each shoes 
@_date: 2019-06-04 14:20:34
Except the day it never goes up again, like what happened in the end of the crazy Internet 10 years. So yea it takes guts cause you'll never know how far it can go down and you're already losing money. Some people who doesn't know anything about all that, if you tell them that you're at - 70% and buying more, they'll think you're crazy
@_date: 2019-06-04 14:47:03
Yeah I already know that, otherwise I would not be invested in Crypto. Yes Internet had some winners but a lot of them disappeared
@_date: 2019-02-27 17:13:47
It would be amazing at the  waiting room
@_date: 2019-06-04 11:37:53
That's nothing at all. Watch your stack becoming minus 70% and stay like that for a year or two without moving and people saying everywhere, it will never go back up, this is the end. And suicide lines everywhere on Reddit. If you're not ready for that and are already super scared, man just drink or something, chill out
@_date: 2019-02-26 10:22:53
Okay stop being sick now people I have a new game to finish, then come back later, I have a new game to buy, I need at least 4 clients, I want one for collection, one to play and I need money for the snacks. Some of you like to play Mario Kart? If you win, I'll give you free consultation, if you lose then, you snooze
@_date: 2019-06-27 08:39:05
I have money on the side for emergency, I'm not crazy
@_date: 2019-02-05 13:18:21
Is this Rola? 
@_date: 2019-02-15 11:18:04
What a piece of shit 
@_date: 2019-02-26 10:26:01
They want to get Richie Rich faster than your mama put you out in this wild wild world. And they so want to prove people wrong as fast as they can. But anyway patience is the key
@_date: 2019-06-04 15:12:28
I don't think 2000+ Cryptos will stay. 90% of them will disappear
@_date: 2019-06-04 13:15:53
It's the best time to buy indeed. But hey when you're new in the game, you only see your money divised by two. It takes guts to buy more. I understood that later too
@_date: 2019-02-15 09:26:21
I swear that Fox owns me money 
@_date: 2019-06-04 09:49:40
People were posting that in 2018 when the bearmarket was crushing on the Crypto space with crazy drops. But doing this after a 10% fall, wow man, I'm scared that you do something you should not if it goes down more
@_date: 2019-06-29 16:23:34
Marry me Shalini
@_date: 2019-02-16 11:09:14
That JPM Coin is just an advertisement for Bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-02-26 15:00:34
Ain't no way its gonna take 5 years
@_date: 2019-02-26 10:23:49
Fuck PayPal

Bitcoin always crashes both ways, it's a roller-coaster 
@_date: 2019-04-11 17:01:36
Yes of course that's why I'm in for profit. I'll probably be dead before it happens
@_date: 2018-11-30 13:00:13
It's like a woman brain 
@_date: 2018-07-16 15:39:34
You must be new. They all tied up to Bitcoin so if BTC fall, they all fall off together and vice versa, but that's kinda fucked up though 
@_date: 2018-07-19 13:32:45
Yeah so let's hope it's not just like April 12th
@_date: 2018-07-19 13:34:19
Bar Mitzvah 
@_date: 2018-07-28 14:53:59
Yeah and now it went down. Exactly like the other day
@_date: 2018-07-28 07:47:55
So I don't understand anymore, is it going up or down? Is there a fight against bulls and bears that's why it's completely not moving at all? Even though the volume is going up? 
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:34:17
Yeah it halved, that's crazy, WTH
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:41:02
Probably cause I was like why the volume is so high and the prices are not moving. But now I got my answer 
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:39:08
Just like right now, I thought it was gonna go up even more and I check and boom halved (by the way my numbers were in euros, but almost the same though) 
@_date: 2018-07-28 07:50:27
There's still Forex for USD, Euro and all that and still people uses that money so? Your argument is invalid 
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:36:38
The total was 32 billions, now it's 17b. I'm talking about the whole market 
@_date: 2018-07-09 05:58:24
Crypto is so dead man that's why big exchanges re making so much money and investing in making their platforms better 
@_date: 2018-07-19 15:45:47
That was the worst day ever, I can still remember as I Duncan MacLeod had traversed through multiple centuries 
@_date: 2018-07-16 15:38:42
I love thiz game!
