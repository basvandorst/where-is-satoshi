Bitcoin is not as easy for day to day spending, however as time goes by I believe it will be. Currently, if my info is up to date, these are a few who will use bitcoin: Overstock.com, Expedia, eGifter, Newegg, Subway, Roadway Moving Company, Intuit PayByCoin Services, Microsoft, Reeds Jewelers, Inc. and others.  If you are in the USA then as with all things the IRS wants their share. Bitcoin is being accepted by more and more businesses from smaller establishments to large corporations.

I was told yesterday that Bitcoin crashed 0ver 90% in 2011, again crashed in 2012 over 35%, and in 2013 it crashed over 80%. In 2014 I believe it had a large crash, early in 2017 it was down over 30% and now again in 2018 the same is happening.   BUT each time it came back, it came back strong and how could it possibly go away. It has affected the entire world on many levels and will be here long after we are gone.

Great advise for most people. Debt relief is great security and with the freedom to spend more cash flow later to buy cryptocurrency.

According to Mufti Muhammad Abu Bakar, Bitcoin can be Halal (permitted) in certain cases. “In Germany, Bitcoin is recognized as a legal currency and therefore qualifies as Islamic money in Germany.In countries such as the US, Bitcoin lacks official legal monetary status but is accepted for payment at a variety of merchants, and therefore qualifies as Islamic customary money”,
If cryptocurrency sees the influx of 2 billion Islamic people the sky’s the limit.
