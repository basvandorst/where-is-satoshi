That has nothing to do with monetary inflation or deflation. I must have explained it to you 4 times now.


You really should take a look at [this ]( and think how it might be relevant in your case..

Amazing news!  I wonder what they will charge for deposits &amp; withdrawals over the LN..  Obviously,  there will be 0 fee if you have a channel open with them,  almost free if you don't but they will still have to charge some kind of fee as an exchange ..
This really is a huge milestone.  I'd say that the fee spike in December 2017 was largely due to people buying from and sending to exchanges during the irrational peak of the bull market.  However,  open large LN channel with your exchange and a significant portion of those onchain transactions could easily be avoided.  Not to mention the much smoother UX.  I'd like to see Coinbase and Binance follow suit.

That isn't is meant by monetary deflation.  [See here.](
Absolutely no part of Bitcoin's monetary policy is deflationary since inflation never falls below 0.

No.  Still wrong.  You can't use terms like inflationary and deflationary to describe things like human demand.  That makes 0 sense whatsoever.   It would be easier to just admit that you're wrong, learn from it and grow up.

All cold wallets are offline though..

The problem comes when you mail them to your customers and they obviously need to be stored safely.  Failing to do this puts people's lives and property at risk.

But what was this figure when Bitcoin was designed around 12 years ago..?

No, it isn't.  See [here]( for a simple explanation of monetary deflation.


Yes, of course I did.  This has nothing to do with monetary deflation.  The Bitcoin still exist, the original owners just lost access/ability to spend.
Bitcoin is inflationary up to a defined maximum supply, at which point inflation drops to 0%.  Monetary deflation occurs when inflation **drops below 0%.**

Bitcoin isn't deflationary.

'Price deflation' isn't a thing though.  I think you're deflecting given the context of the discussion up to this point.
Can I offer you some advice? Admitting that you are wrong or misinformed is one of the most emotionally and intellectually liberating things you can do.  Consider it.

Sounds like socialism.
You can't do this in a truly decentralized system.

Did you read the definition I linked?  What does the amount of humans have to do with Bitcoin's monetary policy?  Deflation occurs when inflation drops below 0% **and that never occurs with Bitcoin.**  It's **that simple.**


What!?  You're completely incorrect though whilst trying to tell me that I am!!


It isn't.


You're an idiot.  That has absolutely nothing to do with inflation and deflation.
