You made the same basic post as him a few minutes after he was banned. That's the issue in your case. If you want to appeal your ban, modmail on is the right place to ask (which it seems you have done).
By the way, the admins will *never* confirm anything about anyone's IP addresses nor will they confirm that two accounts are likely to be the same person (or not) because it's a serious violation of their internal policies (sharing personal information). Not that it matters here, but just to let you know.

For the record, Bitcoin posts aren't removed:

I'm not claiming that you're him so I'm not sure why you keep bringing up getting confirmation from the admins, it's obvious you have different writing styles so it seems pretty unlikely.
I said you helped him repost immediately after he was banned. I'm not sure what you expected to happen after that...

Um, none of that is true.
Your friend wasn't banned for posting about bitcoin.  He was banned after attacking one moderator in modmail, being muted, and then sending this over private message:
Your post was taken down when it was clearly someone helping him repost.  Here is the full ban message since you didn't post the entire message.
I see you edited your post to remove the mention of your friend doing the same thing.  Here is the archived version:
I also see you claim we never replied to you in modmail:


Well, here is the modmail I sent you 2 hours before that comment:

It says "trolling and ban evasion **for** I assumed you knew you were not him.
