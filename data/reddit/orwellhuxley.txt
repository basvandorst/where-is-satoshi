Stop spewing your bullshit. Euro is working. Stop blaming the failings of individual countries on a currency. 
Will you also start to claim that Dollar has never worked?


Because taxes determine if the currency works, or not. Dollar probably also doesn't work, because states in the US have different taxes...
So? You think US doesn't have different cultures throughout the US?


[Link]( (pdf). See "EUROPEAN IDENTITY AND CITIZENSHIP".
You can see that the question "In the future you see yourself as..." is answered "Nationality + European". So, European identity *is* developing.
Continue to be ignorant, though.

Of course it will go up, because BTC is designed that way.

Bitcoin is a terrible currency at the moment. It has too much risk, and I don't think anyone would put their whole savings into it. Maybe 10%, but certainly not 100% of it. For now, Bitcoin can't be used for much, and this encourages hoarding, i.e. waiting till the Bitcoin rises higher, and exchanging it for EUR/USD, and profiting from it. You can't deny that.


The Euro has a few failings where it should be fixed, but calling it 'failed' is just too much.


Such as...

You still haven't learned what the word means. Or do you think that if somebody doesn't agree with your preconceived ideas, is a 'propagandist'?

Considered, by Cypriot government themselves. It seems they don't respect EU laws.

The Euro will survive either way, but what needs to be done to balance the differences between competitiveness is to establish the fiscal union, similar to the one in the US. 
The Euro currency was developed in hopes that every euro zone state will have similar competitiveness levels. This is clearly not the case anymore, and we see asymmetrical competitive levels across the member states.

That's what you want to believe. You trying to justify their crimes just shows what person you are.

Using that idiotic factually incorrect animated movie just shows how ignorant you are.

What 'out'?


What 'idea'?

I'm frankly disgusted that people blame EU, or Merkel for that matter. Cyprus has only itself to blame, because they bought useless Greek bonds, even though they knew that they'd have a loss.

There's no such thing as new world order in conspiratard sense.

And when nothing happens, they'll exchange Bitcoins for Euros again.
@_date: 2013-04-04 12:40:27
Because it is.
Nobody is using bitcoin for actual *useful* things, like buying something with them. What people are doing is making an investment, and hoping that the value of it will go up, and they will exchange it for more useful currencies like EUR/USD. Bitcoin will be useless forever, if you can't buy anything with it other than drugs.

Learn what the word propaganda means.
edit: never mind, read your comment history. You're a really, really angry person and post almost nothing but the hate on the euro, or hate towards the EU.

And... The post has been downvoted. This community is seriously biased. Like always, lolbertarians don't want to listen, nor do they want to hear facts. Very similar to fundamental christians.

A lot of it is bullshit. It's just another conspiratard video so they can feel like they know something other people don't, and feel good about it.
@_date: 2013-03-19 16:02:10
What? I'm interested in Bitcoin, and dislike people who're spreading misinformation about *anything*. If I see what I think is misinformation, or untrue, I comment on it. How is that 'trolling'?
