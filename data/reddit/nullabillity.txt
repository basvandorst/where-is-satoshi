Microsoft bought Skype **from** eBay, beacuse they couldn't figure out how to monetise it.

One language. I'd wish.

This is not possible because of how Wi-Fi works. It'll still be interceptible for everyone else on the network.

Slowly growing but still tiny minority.

That wouldn't be less of a "problem" with P2P. The only difference would be that everyone would be able to see it, instead of just their server operators.

You mean they've managed to sell it to people better. That doesn't mean there are any pros for it.

No, as long as you're still on an unencrypted network (required for hotspots so users don't have to enter a passphrase they don't know to in order to connect) anyone with a wi-fi card that supports promiscous mode can intercept anything that goes on.

Not if you want it to not involve lots of manual labour for the user.

Yes, but a tiny minority.

Expecting people to pay for wi-fi hotspot access? Cute.
Expecting people to buy credit in some currency they've never heard about before in order to pay for wi-fi hotspot access? Bahaha.

Binary is just a representation for numbers, not a language.

And *those*, my dear, are low-level instructions optimized for a computer to execute, and still completely useless for Human&lt;-&gt;Human interaction (hell, there's a reason it's not used anymore for Human&lt;-&gt;Machine).

What you don't realize is that ***PUBLIC WI-FI IS NOT ENCRYPTED***.

So would you mind telling me why this would be an improvement then?
