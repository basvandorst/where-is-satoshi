This sounds a little dangerous to me.  For instance, a single user can't download the whole p2p web, so each person would obviously have a subset. How is that subset determined?  If you download and seed as you browse (so you only store things you have viewed) that's one thing but i don't want to be caught seeding someone's illegitimate site.

gotta have that initial capital to put up front unfortunately.  This way I can test the waters a little bit with out investing too much money into it, and minimize my risk.  If all goes swimmingly I can add another box or go the SC route.  "Gotta have money to make money" as they say.

Hell that Jalepeno at 4.5 GHps for 149 sounds pretty amazing.  Would be a great expandable way at building an ultimate miner.

Good Guy OP:  Posts sites that use referral links.  Doesn't use them.

Played with the numbers quite a bit, and at 4.5Gh/s, and the estimated 80W power usage, if I got the unit at the time the blocks halved in price, we are still looking at a payoff time of 16 days, and a net profit of 2500 USD over about 12 months.  Not too shabby.

I think technically encrypting a message and sending it via clear text is still encryption.  Sort of like saying, Oh I can't send locked boxes via mail anymore?  Well, I'll just put a smaller locked box inside of the unlocked one!

I mean during periods of high volume not being able to place an order because it requires 3 different pages, and each page shows an error about 80% of the time reading "Database object is busy", causing me to have to start the process all over.  It took me around 20 minutes just to place an order dealing with error messages like that.

CampBX blows.  I tried to use them as an alternative during a previous rally up past $900 and they were quickly overwhelmed by even the smallest volume of trades, leading to missing peak sell/buy points.  Never again.

Man am I feeling the pain on a single GPU.

So in my opinion this is more of a question of implementation.  Keep in mind that even modern day banks take days or weeks before the transaction is fully finalized.  Quite alot of things happen during a transaction:  and most of those don't happen at the point of sale.  What happens instead is the bank says "He has money, approve, we'll send you it in a few days/advance it to you" and then take the risk of something going wrong in the process.  It actually takes quite a bit of time to send money, and in exchange for the risk of floating the cash, the banks charge account fees etc.
In other words, for a currency to send a transaction in 10 minutes without risk mitigation is phenomenal and a huge improvement.  The only solution to the problem you propose (and a host of other problems) is to begin opening bitcoin banks (which I believe to be a hot-button issue here since most users like not having any governing authority) but it seems to me to be a necessity to provide stability, risk mitigation and asset management.

Well I was noticing the BitForce line now switched from "preorder" to "order now" does that not mean that they are now in production?

Well that's the point of these hearings isn't it?  These are politicians, not computer scientists or IT people.  They don't understand the issues so they gathered a panel of people who understand it better to explain it to them so they can make decisions.
They are getting a lot of grief but they are really giving it their best shot at understanding the technology to the best of their ability.  Most of them have even done some extensive research, they just aren't computer security experts.

The reason the attack isn't XSS is that the JS exploit originated and targeted the same context.  If it was a separate website (for instance originating from yourdomain.com) which executed code targeted at another domain (to localbitcoins.com) then it is XSS, but that isn't the case here, unless (as said) the uploaded content was hosted on a different environment.

I'm in, but only if there is a share involved.

Jokes on them then, it caused it to not be profitable again.

The death of GPU mining indeed.  So what are the ASIC choices then?
@_date: 2013-09-13 19:39:52
It seems as though you are right.  This would definitely fall into persistent XSS.  It still seems wrong to lump them in to XSS, as traditionally XSS required the use of a secondary context, but I believe the page you sent me summarizes it quite succinctly:

This is an ingenious exploit.  It doesn't even look like XSS to me, just a simple REST hack relying on localbitcoins ability to make POST calls without requiring a second form of authentication.  I hate to say this about someone who stole money, but this is a pretty solid piece of code.

I tried using CampBX yesterday and it was the most frustrating experience so far with bitcoins.  I continuously recieved "The database object is busy" errors, presumably some TCP layer mitigating DB connections that just can't handle the load of an incredibly low volume.
