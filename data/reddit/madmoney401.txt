na that was not my intent... its all gone now :)

i feel like they halted withdrawls when they made an annouuncement about the malleability thing....so im assuming thats what we are supposed to believe
@_date: 2014-02-21 19:00:46
I think we'd all like more btc than we got but I'm pretty sure u not supposed to be begging
@_date: 2014-03-04 08:33:08
either mt gox was the most poorly run company on earth or something shady happened........ im sure im late to the party but shouldnt there be evidence of this theft on literally thoudands of computers because of the blockchain?  
@_date: 2014-02-20 08:10:07
what happens if they dont and jus continue to nose dive into nothing?

@_date: 2014-05-13 23:03:38
my bad ill delete it 
@_date: 2014-03-13 06:51:53
im very late to the party but after the silk road bust being on the news i learned about btc.... researching bitcoin blew my mind and and i was like damn this will change the world... im poor irl so i only got like .001 btc from faucets but i still believe in it lol
@_date: 2014-03-04 08:53:32
lol u got a cool mom my mom call its "your bit money thing" what other card do you think theyll play?  i personally find it hard to believe that they would lose any coins to a malleability issue but i recall them stating that as the reason for haulting withdrawls when they initially did...... i jus dont know what else they could try and blame it on besides comin out and saying "we fucked up"
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:34:58
lol i may have the discipline you got the brains 
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:43:14
Awesome idea!
@_date: 2014-03-04 08:59:34
that sounds like a more likely story........ if thats their card im sure theyre trying to find a target to point the finger at before they show us that card
