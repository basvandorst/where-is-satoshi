The shipping is more than 2x the price of one die :-)

Transfer them to your bitcoin address from your mining account. How you do that depends on which pool you use.

At current exchange rates having 1000 BTC doesn't make you a millionaire.

Do you remember explicitly setting google authenticator for logging in? If not it may have defaulted to yubikey. Try leaving the OTP field blank.

I'm doing the same. I already have minepeon installed in anticipation.

The blockchain.info app stores your password in plain text. I just read about it in another thread. You should uninstall it.

It depends on your settings. By default it is included in the buy transaction. The orders, however, don't show the fees. If your order says you sell some btc and receive $10, you really only receive $9.94.

Bitcoin makes flattr unnecessary.

My confirmation emails stopped long ago. I have no idea why.

Cause you don't have enough funds.

Block chain.info will generate a "donate" button that is trivial to add to a web page.
Putting a QR code of the donation address on a site would make it trivial for a reader with a bitcoin app on a phone to donate.

It was the 13" model

Sealswithclubs has a very nice android app (though it uses a lot of battery power). I like it more than the website.  
1 chip = 0.001 BTC on the sealswithclubs.  Cash games have a minimum buy-in of 40 chips. There are tourneys you can play for 10 or less. They have an hourly freeroll that pays the top three places (0.025 BTC for 1st).

What does the proof of work requirement mean for devices that usually run on battery (laptops, cell phones)?  I can imagine the 4-minutes of work will quickly add up to drained batteries.

You can get a retina mbp for $1399 from a retailer whose name escapes me. The price drop made it on Google news.

BFL turned off the new ASICs so they can start shipping them.
@_date: 2013-06-15 20:08:04
I agree

I can send a microtransaction back to you.

How can you tell when a coin is "lost?"
@_date: 2013-04-02 04:13:48
Transfer larger amount in, then transfer larger + small amount out.
@_date: 2013-04-24 00:03:43
Changing it to frugal didn't help for me.
I am able to reliably send from the android app without fees. I simple hit cancel when asked about the fee.

Use two-factor authentication for your email. Problem avoided.

It's actually 0.5 cents on a dollar.

It sounds like you want SealDeals.info. Here's a blog post that explains the service:

If you have access to a bitcoin wallet app on a phone, the QR code makes it easier for you to deposit into your sealswithclubs account. Scanning the address into the wallet app prevents typos.
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:37:05
Thanks.  I didn't realize I had to go to the "Receive Money" section to manage addresses.
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:41:19
Are you entering the code before it changes in Google authenticator?
@_date: 2013-04-02 17:34:49
And here I thought you just suck at math.
@_date: 2013-05-02 13:32:25
To see all fees you have to look at both the BTC and USD history.

Most people want to sell their chip credits. I think it would be cool to have the chips.

The blockchain.info app is a weak link. It stores your password in plain text. I just learned that a few minutes ago and uninstalled it.

No paper needed:
1. Generate a paper wallet using an offline, live-linux distro
2. Save the paper wallet to a PDF
3. Encrypt the PDF using gpg
4. Securely delete the PDF
5. Never decrypt the resulting file on a computer with network access
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:57:11
Or you could just never cash them out.

Mt. Gox reduces the transaction fee as the number of trades you make increases. There is incentive to break large transactions up into many smaller ones.

How much do you want to pay?
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:16:17
I understand how flattr works. I don't use it because I don't want to donate a regular amount on a monthly basis.  I suspect the reason it isn't popular is because other people feel the same way.
I do, however, want the ability to make one-time micro-donations.

I believe the risk of my house burning down is much greater than someone cracking the RSA 4096-bit encryption on my paper wallet.

The android app.

I currently pay $0.05
