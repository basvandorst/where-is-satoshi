So did you lose it through trading or was it actually stolen/hacked?

There's still this ~~10k~~ [35k]( BTC bet on pirate40 not defaulting going on: 
Let's see how that turns out...

Apparently some piece of mining hardware. Can't find the original thread, but [this forum]( is full of discussions around it.

how many connection does the bitcoin client show (status bar at the bottom)?

So, what exactly is your point? No freakin system in the world is "100% secure", but guess what, most of them still work most of the time.
In that matryoshka scenario an attacker would have to find an exploit in every layer to break in and steal the coins, so one would use different OSes, all stripped down to the bare minimum.
And just assuming that there is a bug/exploit in the BTC client is not reasonable, that thing is open source and with the incentive of anonymously robbing people through the internet, you can bet that many people have tried their luck finding one.

Anything going on at SR is most definitely already illegal in most of the western world. But thanks to the power of TOR and BTC nobody can figure out who's behind it.
@_date: 2011-08-08 16:17:36
I don't see why it should not. There are many people from the US [trading on the market](

You should probably link to github from somewhere on the website. I left it thinking it was closed source, which would have been a no go for bitcoins.

Does it need to be any more complicated than Etherpad? Google Docs is all fancy and stuff but you need an account to edit.

You can trade person to person and pay with PayPal at  
If the other person unlocks your bitcoin right after recieving your payment, you can get your hands on bitcoins within minutes!

Thanks for replying. If your plans are to release every piece of code needed to run this thing as FOSS, why doesn't that paragraph say exactly that?
Saying you want to open up "as much as possible", and the strawman argument about privacy/safety all sounds like there will be some strings attached.

If you don't know how the attacker got in, how do you know 2FA would have helped? For all we know, your computer could still be infected and the next time you own BTC they will disappear the same way.

Keeping the old one for reference:

Yes, please do rewrite and clarify!
If you promise that I will get everything I need to run this on my own infrastructure under a FOSS license, I will donate.

Computer-generated paper wallet. You could encrypt it with a password you can remember. Make sure to keep enough backups.

So how many feet are in a cup of bitcoins?

Carrying buckets of water from the next river when your apartment is burning?
I'm not sure what kind of anarchist beehive i kicked here.

And who is going to pay for it?

fire departments?

Would the insurance cover against phishing?

How strong was your passphrase? As Gavin explained, maybe someone unrelated to the appspot site bruteforced it.

I think everybody wants fire protection service. I also think everybody wants tap water, road infrastructure, protection from theft and violence, and a couple of other things. And I think wealthy people should give a little more towards establishing this common living standard than poor people.
But that's just, like, my opinion, man.
