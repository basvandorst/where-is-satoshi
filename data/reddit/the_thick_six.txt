While I'm optimistic Bitcoin and Crypto will continue to go up we do have to consider the added nuance of governments really starting to crack down on crypto hard as of the last couple months so there is a little legitimate concern there but overall I think crypto will be king in the end.

Are the FBI still in possession of these Bitcoin?

I'd like to think most of these early Bitcoin adopters and sellers got back into it sometime later so they still made some massive gains. It would be crazy to think that this guy owned Bitcoin in 2011 and has just never bought back in for the last 6 years.

Yup. I honestly feel like such an asshole. I was genuinely convinced my friends and I were gonna get rich off this shit. I don’t think they blame me because at the end of the day it was their decision to go in but I did introduce them to how great it was. I still feel like shit about it.

How would the government go about taxing bitcoin accurately? Maybe it's possible but I'm not sure how that works.

I'm new here and basically at the last stage in this picture. I already put 500 in Bitcoin and 500 in Ethereum but that was just getting my toes in the water, I plan on putting alot more down. My only question is should I put all of it in bitcoin or should I diversify my investments? What do you guys think?

Hey, I use an anonymous exchange to make my crypto transactions and I will take profit by buying physical goods with my coin (under 10k in price). Am I good on tax evasion?

CPAs are accountants, not lawyers. They're also not working for the IRS. I'm also on an anonymous reddit account. You're not that bright are you?

How can they possibly track my identity off of the blockchain? All the blockchain displays is my public address. No one can associate the address with a specific individual unless they had some additional information.

How much time and money do you think the IRS has to parse through my fucking social media posts to see if I talk about crypto in there. I don't have millions of dollars or anything the crypto market. I have a relatively small amount. You're insane if you think the IRS are gonna go through such extremes like I'm a suspected terrorist or something to get an extra couple grand from me.

I'm using Chinese exchanges so, I doubt it. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:14:47
yeah what additional information would they have? tell me tax genie
