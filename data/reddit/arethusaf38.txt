I've used localbitcoins.com dozens of times and never had a problem, but the spreads are quite large.

There is no two week limit. I once waited four months for a transaction to be rejected from the mempool owing to a mistake with low transaction fee. 
Yours will come back eventually, but don't hold your breath.

Having been mining/trading since 2013, I have taken out my initial investment x8, and still have 20x my initial investment riding. Of course, I would like to see further profits, but if it all crashes to nought, I can still rest easy in the knowledge that I've done fairly well out of it and have money in the bank that I would never have seen with traditional investments.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:42:25
There is the escrow element,  and feedback scores. I don't trade with anyone unless they have 100% positive feedback.

And a very merry Christmas to you too, sir.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:56:41
I had the same problem with them. Spent about five days trying to jump through their hoops and paying numerous bank charges and exchange fees for Euros before finally giving up, buying Bitcoin and transferring it out. I suggest you save yourself a lot of grief, and money, and simply do the latter.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:38:52
I've used localbitcoins.com many times without a problem.  Send your btc there.  Once you start the deal the coins are held in escrow.  The buyer can pay the fiat directly into your bank account, and once you've received it you can release the bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-02-03 13:40:58
I use Deribit. Don't know if it's the best place, but it works for me.
@_date: 2017-02-22 23:22:54
Unless you have very deep pockets, there's every chance you'll be churned and burned in very short order (pardon the pun).
However, should you wish to continue, Poloniex is fairly reputable, US domiciled and has decent volume.

It's possible. There are so many variables and unknowns.  However, you're probably better off not trying to time the market and either buying it all in one hit, or averaging in.  There is so much potential to the upside that you'll probably find $1000/btc cheap, in the not-too-distant future.
@_date: 2017-02-21 23:49:51
I suppose it depends if the transactions had actually been executed by Coinbase onto the bitcoin network, after which my understanding is they cannot be stopped or reversed. My knowledge of the technical side of crypto (as opposed to the financial) is quite rudimentary so hopefully someone can provide a more reassuring/enlightening answer!

TIL the Honey Badger is the Chuck Norris of quadripeds.
@_date: 2017-02-09 22:41:32
Yes but it would cost the buyer more, which I think is what this question is getting at. Isn't it?

I've heard about it too.  I have no solution to that. The only thing I can say is that it hasn't happened to me and it may not be a problem at all. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 12:28:52
I agree.
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:45:58
I'm in a similar position. I took some profit recently and put some money into physical gold and silver, a private pension, a new bike and gave some away to people who needed it.
Aside from that, there's no traditional investment or savings mechanism that cuts it.
Felt really good to be able to help some people out though, and for me, that is the essence of bitcoin. Screw the establishment financial institutions and their debt slavery.

CGT hasn't been determined in the UK on crypto currency gains. Of course, given their expertise in drafting retro-active legislation, you may well be obliged to cough up in the future which would of course be entirely immoral and contrary to any sensible 'natural law', but that's how governments work. This is why they're so threatened by bitcoin etc., and why we should all be using bitcoin etc. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:21:16
Go ahead and declare it if that makes you more comfortable. I won't, until it becomes a lawful requirement. In the meantime, I'll ensure I have plenty in reserve to satisfy their attempts at theft and if it becomes too 'griefy', will sadly acquiesce and pay them off.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:05:42
Well I sold a few bitcoins recently and the deposits were definitely unusual activity.  I was concerned about restrictions etc but absolutely nothing came of it and I had a well-documented trail ready to present to them if needs be.  I never said a SAR wouldn't be a problem, as of course anyone having their current account frozen for fifteen days is probably going to experience difficulties.
The info that I posted about no cash limits into personal accounts is from HMRC with reference to the FCA's stance on reporting. OP's question was partly about some kind of threshold limit (10k) which apparently is not the case.
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:44:40
In the UK there is no restriction on cash deposits into your personal bank account (business accounts are treated differently). However, if large deposits are unusual activity, under FCA money laundering regs you may be asked to explain where it came from.
If you're selling bitcoin online for GBP it shouldn't be a problem as you can show your transaction history.
I've done it a few times and haven't had any problems.

@_date: 2017-11-01 10:25:38
If you sold the BTC for USD, how would you receive the funds?  I haven't tried signing up but could see the withdrawal of profits to a foreign account being a problem, especially as there are more than likely currency controls in Zimbabwe.
I'm curious to see if it's feasible too, though!

I don't know the answer to this, but I do know that Deribit, a bitcoin futures and options platform, has temporarily removed Bitfinex from its basket of exchanges used to determine bitcoin's spot price as its prices are currently considered unreliable.
@_date: 2017-09-22 15:39:39
Sounds like the UK too, to be honest.
@_date: 2017-09-06 16:13:36
Thank you both for the answers. That answers my question.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:20:41
Last year I waited four months for a bitcoin transaction to go through, which it eventually did.  I inadvertently sent it with a low tx fee.  At the moment transactions are very backed.  As u/mkiwi said, it will be ok, one way or another.
@_date: 2017-05-10 08:11:01
It has so much potential, the best time to buy bitcoin is probably now. You will never time this market as there are so many factors at play. But be prepared for a roller-coaster ride.
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:41:27
Then perhaps you can buy some more at a discount.  Whatever happens, there's still plenty of potential in bitcoin and crypto generally.

No online wallet is safe.  The safest option is cold storage.
@_date: 2017-05-17 19:30:01
Yeah! I thought I'd lost it and it appeared back in my wallet months later.  I also simply used the default fee.  Out of curiosity, which wallet did you use?  The problem I had was with the Bitcoin Core QT wallet.  More recently, I've been using Jaxx and have never had a problem or inordinately long delay.  I did see a post on reddit earlier today about a mempool backup of over 200,000 transactions, so that may have something to do with it.
@_date: 2017-05-08 19:44:39
So it will either go up, down, or sideways. You sir, are a guru.
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:40:07
Then don't think of it as a currency.
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:52:30
I thought it was really high when it went to $300, $500, $750, $1000. Perhaps it will re-trace, perhaps it won't.  If you want to hold bitcoin, would you rather pay $1700 or $3000, or more?
The potential to the upside is unlimited, so my suggestion would be to take a chance.  If your investment pays off, great.  If not, it's not the end of the world, but in a bull market almost certainly the longer you agonise over the details the more you'll end up paying.
As with any investment, never invest what you can't afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:52:12
That was a great explanation. Helped me out too, so thanks.  This impasse is such a shame as there has been a boom in awareness and adoption, and I fear that the high fees and long waits are giving a bad first impression to new users.
@_date: 2017-05-29 11:14:20
Just get in and hodl. There has been turbulence for years, and most of us are well in profit. You will never time this market, and any coming volatility may actually benefit you.
@_date: 2017-05-24 04:42:10
If you think bitcoin might be a good investment, just go ahead.  As with all investments, if you can't afford to lose it, don't do it.  If the price does come down, buy more and lower your average price.
On current form, I think it's a reasonable bet that there's plenty of room to the upside in the future.
@_date: 2017-07-10 17:13:00
I don't understand what's going on.
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:00:48
I would expect to see a premium over spot, but I don't see differentials of $200 over, say, Poloniex when buying in the UK. The asking price depends somewhat on the availability of potential sellers though, so perhaps your location has a bearing on this?
Supply and demand, and all that.
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:46:34
I waited three months recently for a transaction to go through, despite paying the recommended fee. It did go through eventually, though.
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:40:46
Why? You buying?
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:14:35
I've been investing in bitcoin since 2013.  It's as safe - if not safer - as keeping your cash in a bank.
I suggest you research a wallet that you're comfortable with, and buy from localbitcoins.com.
Back up your wallet to multiple places, and consider storing your coins offline (cold storage) for extra security.
There's still a long way for bitcoin to potentially go. Enjoy the ride!
@_date: 2017-07-16 13:14:15
I kept quite a bit of cash in reserve for just such an occasion as this. I'm averaging in with some very nice discounts at the moment.
@_date: 2017-07-16 15:30:22
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:42:07
It is getting a bit unworkable, not only for the high fees, but also the lack of confidence in a transaction being processed in a timely manner. There are certainly far better options out there, the catch being that you need BTC to buy them.
@_date: 2017-07-14 17:29:21
No-one can give you definitive advice on what to do. Bitcoin is volatile and this could just as easily have gone the other way.
Anyone who claims to be able to predict the near-term price of crypto with accuracy is either deluded, r/iamverysmart or a charlatan.
The normal rules of fundamental and technical analysis don't apply here.
But then, had you bought fiat currency in anticipation of a purchase denominated in a different currency the same thing could have happened. 
So the choice is yours: cut your losses, or hodl and hope for an upswing.
Welcome to bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-07-16 15:27:42
I've been picking up cheap Bitcoin for about a week now. I still have some fiat in reserve for more bargains so on a personal level don't mind if the price drops  for a while longer.
However, on a 'store of value' PR level, it's not so great, meaning that Bitcoin will retain its status of a speculative rather a perceived investment grade asset for a while longer.  We'll see where we go after August 1st.
For veterans, Bitcoin has always been a ride, and this is no exception.
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:06:47
Localbitcoins.com can hook you up with local buyers.
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:39:48

@_date: 2017-06-25 13:10:44
Just do it - you'll never time this market.
@_date: 2017-06-17 06:30:41
Localbitcoins.com.  Have used them many times over the years to both buy and sell and have never had a problem.
@_date: 2017-07-16 15:54:13
Localbitcoins.com then send to Trezor or Ledger Nano, both of which are hardware you will need to buy.
The coins will probably be safe on localbitcoins until the hardware arrives (I say this because a web-wallet is far more vulnerable than a stand-alone. Better still, cold storage). Make sure you set up the account with a strong password and 2FA.
Welcome to bitcoin, and enjoy the ride!
PS in terms of price, now is probably a good time to buy.  I am, and I've been doing this for four years. I'm certainly no trading guru, but I've done very well on crypto investments especially when compared with the traditional forms of investment and speculation.
@_date: 2017-06-07 05:50:21
First, bitcoin is only divisible to eight decimal places. Second, I would send you a satoshi, but with a fee of around $4 I'm afraid it's not economically viable to do so.
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:46:45
Sorry to hear you/dad got ripped off.  Hopefully you'll have more success with proper crypto-currencies.
@_date: 2017-06-08 09:23:00
I've been waiting five days (should take '1-2 days') to withdraw the proceeds of a BTC sale via Euros into GBP, having jumped through all the verification hoops they put up four days ago.
My recommendation for anyone considering using them is to steer well clear. 
There's something not right about their whole method of doing business.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:09:48
It is awful. I'll never use them again.

@_date: 2017-06-06 20:01:29
Personally I'd recommend localbitcoins.com
I have bought and sold here many times and never had a problem.  Coinbase is an absolute nightmare.
@_date: 2017-06-17 06:32:02
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:49:57
It's a shame.  In many ways, gold and silver are a natural complement to holding bitcoin.  I certainly believe it beneficial to hold all three.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:20:06
For me in the Uk it's a nightmare. Cards don't work for purchases, and to withdraw the proceeds of sells I have to concert BTC &gt; EUROS &gt; GBP, incurring charges every step of the way. It also wasn't explained anywhere what I'd have to do to withdraw until I started the process, which left me with little choice but to continue. My bank also charged me FX fees so ended up being quite an expensive transaction. I had to send Euros to them (in order for my account to be verified) then wait 6 days to continue (their site says 1-2 days).
So all in all, not good experiences.
I now use localbitcoins.com, the money is in my fiat account immediately, and transactions are fast with the BTC held in escrow until both parties are happy.
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:30:28
Just out of curiosity, how much did you pay for your TBC?
@_date: 2017-06-21 01:31:25
I had nightmares with them, and won't use them again.  Their level of customer service is appalling.
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:38:58
Localbitcoins.com are great, but there may be limits on initial purchases until you have developed a positive feedback profile. Might be worth getting in touch with them though as the BTC would be held in escrow anyway until funds have cleared in the seller's personal bank account, so they might take a large order with some verification.
