Went straight to the most cliched option available!

That was the peak, it goes down to a level of (peak &gt; new level &gt; old level)

Can't be sure till the porn sites start accepting bitcoin.

Cliche is relevant because Every. Single. Person. comes up with roads as the grand problem that only a government can handle.


Ok, religious crazy with a nuke. Now *that* is a hard and pants-shittingly scary problem.


Nah, just a drive-by ;)

My thoughts exactly.

Being able to purchase the regulators is awesome isn't it!
&lt;sarcasm&gt; We obviously need more regulators &lt;/sarcasm&gt;

Who is top of the road now?
As far as I can make out from reviews every single company (whether distributor or manufacturer) has the worst products EVAR and the worst customer service EVAR!

Daaaawwww, so cute.

Yes, at the current reward it is 3600 per day, added mining power can't change that by very much. Certainly not the flood implied by the person I replied to.

What said.
Much of the code is obvious stubs, but it looks like a combination of what bitmessage has with broadcast ads with a few specialized bits added.
Some first order effects I can see if this were implemented:
* Amazon Marketplace and similar services would take a hit, though they may be able to leverage their reputation to stave it off for a while.
* If bidding functionality were added Ebay would take a *massive* hit due to their high fees. Also tactical bidding such as bid sniping would be very difficult to pull off due to random delays in message propagation across the network.
* No central gatekeeper or reviews. This means that you would get more spam, but no one can block negative reviews.
* Reputation gets associated with a given keypair under the control of the person with the reputation, rather than a user account on a gate keepers website.
* Silkroad, who needs Silkroad?

Didn't you get the memo? The way Overstock and TigerDirect accept bitcoin isn't *really* accepting it and they are going to doom us all!!!!111111one!1!

So is like Dwarf Fortress?

Unless they get it into their heads that they need to make an example of someone. If that happens they will likely go for the most ridiculous case that they can use, see MPAA/RIAA.

Those are the minarchists, six months later the person realizes that the state is not needed  for any of those things either. The transformation to anarcho-capitalist is then complete.

At best it is a necessary evil. And when you have one of those the solution is to work towards making the evil unnecessary, not enshrining it forever and ever as a Good Thing.
