It was opened a few days ago when the network was't spammed, so it was only 40 sat/byte. Confirmed really fast. ;)
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:41:55
Can't wait for the idiots that are spamming the network or promoting shit things to finally see that they spent money for nothing. Lightning is inevitable, deal with it. I am tired of seeing morons manipulate innocent people that have a small knowledge on the Bitcoin tech. LN will shit on bcash so hard... oh boy. &lt;3
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:10:22
Sorry, core developers (all around the world) were busy making sure users won't suffer from forks, propaganda, manipulation etc. So yea, Bitcoin is a bit behind in development because of all these attacks, but make no mistake, the COMEBACK is real! Peace!
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:23:55
This is priceless. TPB much love to you guys!
@_date: 2017-02-26 09:18:58
Yep, me too. It's awesome! :D Enjoy mate!

Take a look here: 
They are working on a new client anyway with a lot of futures. So i bet it will be easier to do what you asked for.
@_date: 2017-02-03 18:08:07
Thank you so much for this, i used it and now ViaBTC mined a block and my transaction got its first confirmation after more than 24 hours. Thank you and thank you ViaBTC for that awesome option!

Ahahaha this is gold! Love it!

Congrats, i myself got a KeepKey just a few days ago. I really don't know why people don't choose it more, it seems to be the greatest from them all. Based on all videos and everything that i watched. I guess it's personal taste?
Anyway, hardware wallets FTW!

Bitshit. And the tagline: "Because we can not code, we steal".
@_date: 2017-03-27 12:17:54
He is so pathetic, shouldn't those nodes be clean and without bugs in the first place? Even if what he says is true (but it isn't) look how he cries cause someone told publicly that there is a bug. I can't even believe what a ... meh. Can we please stop talking about this person that ruins bitcoin? Thanks.  
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:47:52
Well, the software too, a lot of people have problems with it now, just watch the KeepKey subreddit.
Anyway, i agree, the device is by far the best, but that's not enough. I learned my lesson: dev team &gt; looks.
I don't really blame the KeepKey team, i just ditched my device and that's it. I watched Ken Hodlers interview with Benny and he said that the founder wanted to leave and abandon the KeepKey project and Ken tried to not let KeepKey die (which could have easily happened) and that is a really nice thing. So i really hope they succeed. Until they pull themselves together i stopped using the device.

Thank you for posting this! I just switched to breadwallet and I was really excited about it and then.. the info about the risk of losing funds. Not cool. So thanks for this!
Great article and well explained!
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:06:57
Yes. Go to settings &gt; local currency and at the top swipe to the left the part with 1,00 eur = xxxxxxx B and it will change from bits to mBTC or to BTC. ;)
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:09:11
Thank you for the link!
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:19:26
I saw how they treated their customers with the BCH thing that was so nasty and resource consuming. They were top notch and patient and kind and calm.
So considering how they acted and reacted at pissed people, I would say their team is awesome! Support is really good.
So when we put a great team together with a great product and great software. What do you get? Simply the best.
So yea, I would say Trezor is really the best hardware wallet.
And note this: i currently do NOT own a trezor(I have other HW wallet), i was merely watching how they performed, and they totally convinced me to buy one.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:28:28
They are assaulted with hits.
@_date: 2017-01-05 01:11:59
This is exactly what i wanted to ask. If we backup the 12 words (seed) on a paper even if blockchain.info gets hacked, everything is encrypted and the private keys not stored on their server, so we can't lose anything, right? And with the seed saved we can recover the coins. Is this not true? Or did i got it wrong? Saw this: 
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:36:27
KeepKey is also [open source](
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:20:36
I don't know about others but my friends would automatically ask me why it's mBTC and not BTC. And when you explain someone that BTC is actually the full size unit not mBTC and if they buy 100 mBTC they practically have 0.1 BTC... well, it's actually worse than explaining from start what is what. This thing with switching to mBTC just because people would buy more and they would be more open to it is kinda not true. But that's just my opinion.
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:04:08
Deleted my Copay wallet, started using breadwallet a few days ago. Should have used breadwallet from start but they had only mBTC (which i don't like). Found out they also have BTC but it's kinda hidden.
I hope they add custom fees and it will be the best wallet in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:22:22


Ahaha. You are awesome!
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:01:00
You do realize they could have said simply "we do not support BCash" and be done with it, right?
They did an effort which they were not bound to, but they still did it. I don't understand how people don't get that.
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:00:55
I tried almost all wallets. I use Electrum and Breadwallet, but with Breadwallet I am waiting to see what they do with the fork in november. If they play it bad I will ditch Breadwallet too, but I sincerely hope they do the right thing. I liked Copay but removed it too.
I will definitely buy a new hardware wallet since they are the best, I am just trying to decide between Ledger and Trezor, and since they are both really nice, it's a bit harder to decide. :)
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:19:20
Here we go again. :)) To the moon!
@_date: 2017-08-11 12:52:12
I am not gonna be the Trezor defendant here but this is plain stupid. It's like i have a car accident and trash my Lamborghini cause I am drunk and then i blame Lamborghini for not helping me. Fuck logic, right?
You people... They can't help you, YOU MANAGE YOUR OWN PRIVATE KEYS!!! What did you wanted them to do? Gift you your coins back? :))
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:53:46
Even when Bitcoin will be $1.000.000 i will still use BTC as a unit. Bitcoin FTW!
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:05:28
I am seriously thinking of buying Trezor or Ledger, my KeepKey is wiped and empty and put aside, since the software is trash. :( Don't know what to choose, Ledger or Trezor. You have both or only one?
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:13:39




PS: We will NOT forget! This entire B2X fiasco was really not cool.

There is something i don't understand in what he said: "Ultimately the rules of Bitcoin work because they're enforced by the users collectively".
How is this true when I think if we would ask the entire bitcoin population and told them what some miners do, what some not well intended people did and then explain SegWit and after that ask everyone if they are ok with what Bitmain does and what miners do, do you think people are OK with being made fun of? 
I am sick to my core that some are allowed to do what they do and still have power over this. If we would ask the millions of users that use bitcoin, do you think they would not want SegWit? I bet you all i have that they would want it. And if all the users want SegWit but only some miners who have something to gain, don't want it, how come we don't have it??? If it is enforced by the users.
I am a user, i want SegWit so that we can have fast transaction, why doesn't my opinion matter? Mine and others of course.
I respect and like a lot. Actually I read all his posts cause he is really smart. But I think someone should push the button and stop allowing some not well intended people to have a say, when we all know what the right thing is.
@_date: 2018-03-31 23:52:11
That is because we already know that Bitcoin is a success, we are only waiting for adoption :P

I loved Adam's comment:


@_date: 2017-10-20 08:39:55
So if I come into your community and spam a shitty link, you would allow it just for transparency? Please stop, you are embarrassing yourself (I mean not you, those who post this). We don't like scams, no one does, that is not censorship that is cleaning the shit.
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:56:51
I liked  comment a lot:


This is starting to be really bad.
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:52:45


I love this one, I was so lazy sometimes to pick up the device. Thank you! It looks awesome!
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:16:04
Ahahaha. This is gold! =)))
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:56:52
Not worth fighting for? :)))) There is no programmer out there that would choose Java over C. ;) Anyway, people are free to choose whatever they want. If you feel safe with your Android device, storing Bitcoins and money, who am I to judge? Cheers!
@_date: 2017-10-16 07:51:07
I got one too and I would definitely recommend a Ledger Nano S. It's plain awesome! We don't win anything from recommending Trezor or Ledger, so...
@_date: 2017-10-05 12:13:47
This is pure gold! Ahahaha
@_date: 2017-10-17 09:28:41
I tried to delete my Blockchain.info wallet and guess what? I can't. Anyone actually managed to delete it? I even contacted support and they said they can't delete wallets and that I should change the personal info to something not true and just stop using the wallet. Be careful people!
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:23:31
Yea, i saw when you asked him, I wanted to ask the same thing but you did it first. Of course he knows what he is doing. 
And i don't get one more thing, if there is so much consensus for S2X, why not add replay protection since everyone will be using S2X, right? It won't hurt anyone, since everyone will be using it. :)
This is why i love bitcoin, they think they can lie and manipulate people... but in the end, we choose what is what and what has value. We, the users!
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:45:55
That's the spirit! The community will not forget that you did the right thing!
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:17:11
You really should not keep bitcoins there! You may end up with an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-17 09:21:38
Breaking news? Who cares about this low IQ manipulator? You people should stop mentioning him, he really isn't worth the time and effort. Just read the latest blog post (Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin) on bitcoin.com, it's disgusting.
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:40:36
No, it's not because you don't agree with us, it's because you people try to say bitcoin is something that it isn't and force this upon a lot of people that do NOT want it. That's fraud! 
Make two-way replay protection and we are all safe! But no, let's lie about it and make people confuse, right?
@_date: 2017-10-07 09:47:15


@_date: 2017-10-08 13:48:10
Yes, I agree, thank you NYA companies! No sarcasm intended, thank you from the bottom of our heart. Bitcoin truly is unstoppable. Imagine if we wouldn't have those attacks? And all would be good in the community. Where would we have been now? 
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:31:06
Nice! Good job and awesome blog post. We do thank you and we do appreciate what you do when you do it in the best interest of our community. ;)
All the best!

I am not sure if i am allowed to say this but "fuck yea!" :D Can't wait for SegWit to be activated. &lt;3 /me high fives the entire core team!

Forever Core Team! Congrats! I read here for some time now, can't believe how some people don't realize the great things our developers do and the good path that they chosen for us all. Scale bitcoin on the long run, responsibly and with great innovations. Cheers all!

I know mate, but i was so happy... ;)
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:16:04
Well then someone with high computational power can actually brute force a used address with a lot of bitcoins in it. Right?
I would create a vanity address but you can't actually have it backed up with a seed, which is kinda not cool.
@_date: 2016-10-27 08:26:25
Well, you should understand that people are hard to work with and not all think straight and smart. If you say something smart and not all people understand it, they will say you are wrong just because they don't understand. With these people is better to just not argue to try and convince them, cause you won't be able to, they can't understand what you say. :)
But not all people are like this, there are a lot of people to whom if you bring up one good argument they are able to say "hey, he is right, it is dangerous to increase the blocksize". ;)
@_date: 2017-07-22 20:06:00
Savage. Brutal. Rekt.
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:37:25
Yes, i just tested and you are right but... didn't know about this :) So thank you for the info! Kinda hard to know secret stuff :P
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:23:51
And it also forces you to use bits and not BTC. Which is really lame. Almost everyone (at the moment) uses BTC, not bits, and it's really confusing to have to convert every time. Even if BreadWallet is nice, lacking such a requested feature is not cool. Why not let people choose what they want? And yes, i know about the pull request which should have been commited a long time ago. I wanted to use BreadWallet but those 2 things forced me to not install the app.
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:24:55
Awesome comment man! I think everyone should see this.
