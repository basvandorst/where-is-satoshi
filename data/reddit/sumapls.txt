Is there a longer video of that kid? I need to see if I should sell or buy

Has always been my strategy, guess I never learn :/ Not once in my life have I succeeded in selling high, buying low.

I'm new to the bitcoin. I did what I promised not to do, but then thought that it would be easy money to sell now and buy back when it has dropped to 1700usd.
Lesson of the day: Don't be greedy.

Familiar with that particular article and technique. That's what I have been doing for for few months, even before I knew it has a name. Now I just thought that I would make some easy money and double my hared earned bitcoins. But lesson learned and I will keep going with dollar cost averaging.

I'm almost as talented as you. This is what I did. And boy do I feel stupid!

I did, I think it was good choice to buy back even though this is how I managed to do it.
I literally have the worst luck when it comes to stock markets, so I'll just stick to long term hodling in the future and don't even try to day trade.

I sold at 2088€ and bought half back at little loss of 2160€. I will gamble the rest, I will buy rest back either if it dips under 2000€ to make up my loss, and if it seems to keep on rising I will buy back at 2200€. I love gambling, no can do...
This was a little lesson for me, and will not make too much loss hopefully.
