Because it was in the press. Everyone talking like it's a viable alternate currency that jumps/drops 10% every time there's any major new coverage...

OK, on the TODO list. Thanks!

some exchanges offer loans as well, so you buy on one, at the same time loan from another exchange and cash out, and then when your BTC arrive (up to several hours later) you return the loan BTC.

point taken - when I started, arbitrage between China/outside *was* in the 20% range :)
So faster data then?

Whoops, sorry! I'll change that.

Up until a week or so ago, it was still doing that - I'm in China, and it all died down when the government made that announcement last week. Still, instant deposit/withdrawal here make it easier to do arbitrage than elsewhere.

yeah, that's kind of why I built the tool - if you run calculations, starting with 100 GBP and then earning 5% on each transaction, you fairly quickly have 10,000 GBP. That said, earning 40% helps jump a few steps...

you mean over time, or just snapshot between exchanges?
@_date: 2013-12-14 13:05:49
yeah, but have you seen it?! 
Speaking seriously, it's got drawbacks - not user friendly, 6 hour delays unless you signup, limited number of exchanges, no cross-currency calculations, can't customise the amount you enter, limited settings, slow to load... aren't these important things?

trade fees are accounted for now, but not deposit/withdrawal.
@_date: 2013-12-14 13:16:20
I've been doing it recently whilst the China/outside market was vastly different (ie. 20-30% differences sometimes), but it's narrowed now. OK, getting the message here about speed :)

While the site beds in, it's set to a slow refresh. Aim is for sub-1 minute as standard depending on API, and possibly realtime although few APIs support genuine realtime data streaming.

Release the... never mind - thanks, on the TODO list.
@_date: 2013-12-14 13:21:09
yeah, same. I've tried a bit with the big numbers at the top (which highlight the best available price), but agree, a stripped down version is now on the todo list - just money-in / money-out
