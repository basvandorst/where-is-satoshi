It is not clear that bitcoin is a security!

Your website states you have filed for a patent on this. We all know you didn't invent multi-sig, so please describe what you're claiming. I'm wary of supporting a potential patent troll, and I'm sure I'm not alone.
EDIT to change "likely future" to "potential" and grammar.

They (SecondMarket and Coinbase) are *saying* that they don't need money transmitter and/or MSB licenses, it's not clear yet whether or not they're right.  This is because the law hasn't been hashed out yet -- either in court or by the range of potential regulators.
Tomorrow some state AG could say that Coinbase is effectively running an exchange, because bitcoin doesn't qualify as something that a broker-dealer can deal in, so despite calling themselves a broker-dealer, they really need a money transmitter license from the state.  This could go to court, and they could lose.  So I would not agree they seem to be compliant.  They have a good argument that they are compliant is the most I'd say!!

I don't see how the bitlicense helps.  It's only good in ny isn't it?  So we'll still have to wait for the other states to catch up won't we?

Transaction went thru a few hours later.

You guys sound like real entrepreneurs, not trolls (I edited my post above) but it seems like everyday I read about a patent that somehow found its way into a troll's hands, and if it covered a basic concept like multi-sig I am sure they'd have a field day with it!  I've got no problem with implementation-specific or IPA patents though.  
I am thinking about signing up.  What's your pricing?  I couldn't find it on the website.
