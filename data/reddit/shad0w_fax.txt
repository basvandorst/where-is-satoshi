Have you tried re-routing a power line?
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:35:10
But then you won't have your knees or your bitcoin

Can we expect alts to surge when the dip happens? Will most btc be put into USD or converted to alts?

Someone should probably take a shit

At least with BTC, every transaction is recorded on the blockchain.. For fucking ever.

I hate when people claim Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. Bitcoin is     
-able to be transported by memorizing some words      
-unable to be seized        
-unable to be censored      
-the only currency enabling microtransactions      
-totally borderless and permissionless       
     
&amp;nbsp;      
       
Do these things have value? Cool, they're intrinsic to Bitcoin. Bitcoin has intrinsic value.

So if I want to store the private keys on a paper wallet, how do I go about that? I need to transfer them from the exchange to an address somewhere, like a software wallet, to get the private keys right? Won't they just be sitting on the software wallet then, even after I've recorded and stored the private keys? Thanks for your input
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:03:48
Yep - gotcha. Thanks!

But as a society, when did we start down this path of irrespectfulness? And do you think this path is disreversible?
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:39:38
I have a transaction that's been unconfirmed for 3 days now, must be sitting in the mempool because fee was too low? What are my options? Will it get processed eventually, or can it be reversed/'un'sent?

Neo smart contracts can be written in a range of languages as well.

Except that energy is primarily to create *security*, not bitcoin. Some people miss that point entirely. How much energy goes into traditional financial banking? Does the resulting security compare?    
    
Downvotes? For this comment on the Bitcoin sub? Yall need [Andreas](

So if I send some bitcoin but don't provide a sufficient fee, the transaction could take a month to go through, or not go through at all? Meanwhile I'm shit out of luck and can't touch the funds, up the fee?

Sell your liver

Report the account while you're at it. I think the 'pretending to be someone else' option covers this
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:41:03
True. But, there are crypto assets that are income producing. Bitcoin may lead others to interest in those, as it has for me
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:04:28
Shit, if Bitcoin reaches 500k, I'll eat John McAfee
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:44:54
Holding NEO generates GAS. You can sell gas for cash. So what's the difference? It's 8% dividends yearly. Edit: Sure, the income isn't revenue as you say (holding stocks doesn't generate revenue either). But it's income none the less.
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:06:32
There is no inflation. The amount of neo and gas is set (100mil coins each). The dividends come from transaction fees collected in gas and rewarded in gas to each share of neo.
So the 'something' which is created that wasn't there before is each and every transaction on the network.

How's she doing at it?
@_date: 2018-03-11 00:14:45
Oh I don't know, maybe because it's parading around BCH as BTC when the larger community agrees it isn't, which can be very confusing for newcomers?
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:19:53
The whole episode isn't about bitcoin. Only a portion there are 2 other topics.
@_date: 2017-06-30 00:12:38
...Until eventually a massive chunk of coins are out of circulation? And the value of one Satoshi will continually rise? Or maybe I'm not understanding correctly.
@_date: 2017-06-30 00:13:01
I think people could remember to cycle their coins once every century
@_date: 2017-06-30 00:44:25
Ah, that would make sense. Thanks.
