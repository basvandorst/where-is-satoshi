Oh man... totally off topic, but.. if you meet a bigot/ racist/ neonazi. Just remind him that if he needed a kidney it wouldn’t matter what color the donor was.

Ethereum mining got me a third of my investment in 3 months. At this rate I would break even in about 9 and maybe se a profit. It’s not the same as mining in 2010, but if you have free electricity I say go for it. GPU mining is possible on linux or windows with AMD graphics cards. A 580 RX 8gb cards is great for that sort of thing. Look in to EthOS

One card will likely not net you much profit, but if you are really interested like I said, start by looking up ethos

Serious question: if it is about being your own bank.. why is 40% of bitcoin owned by 1000 people. Mining is not profitable at a small scale..

Me.. I knew. I had a rig, I just didn’t really think I could afford to buy it outright

I was mining btc in 2013, now I have a crippling depression because I should have been there by now. :(

The amount of electricity used for something that made a few people rich and is likely used by a nation state to unencrypt communications of adversaries deserves some scrutiny. Clearly the demographic that is historical about it saying it is the meaning of evil and the one saying it deserves total pardon are both missing some nuanced conversation that should be happening in its stead.

I recently found a graph where in 2013 the bitcoin cost took a dip before the current climb. I mined 10 dollars in 2013. It’s probably 900 dollars now. I am pretty bummed out. A friend bought bitcoin at 900 and asked me if he should sell. I told him to hold

Let’s take a step back there. Government does not print money. A private corporation ‘The “Federal” Reserve’ does that. Also, they want to tax capital gains, which technically bitcoin would fall under. That all aside, if they outlaw or tax mining, it will hinder crypto currency. I would ad further that the consolidation of mining to massive farms has that effect also. The dream was to run your computer and make money. That isn’t really there any more.

Man I am starting to think that New Zealand guy was right about you lot. I don’t much care about where you are from, doesn’t change anything. Mining bitcoin with GPU isn’t there anymore. Asic is a one trick pony. GPU and systems that pay for themselves is where the real appeal was early on, that is not straight forward any longer. U.S. where the taxation is being discussed does have the FED. In my state we both taxed and legalized, but that is an aside. “Nothing like bitcoin?” Stock robots doing transactions is regulated. Cloud computing is regulated. Are you are really doing is renting your compute to others. Most people here have a lot riding on Bitcoin, so it is hard to hear it. But as someone that mined early on, I liked the promise of crypto. You just have to jump through hoops now. P.S. You are a bit of a prick with your two day old account.
