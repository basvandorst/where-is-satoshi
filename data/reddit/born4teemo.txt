The problem: Trezor is a device on its own, the pc can be full with malware and it still would not harm your security, whereas the USB stick is easily attackable by keyloggers or other trojans, which change the receiving address for example.

It can't be increased "termporarily". Either you do it or you don't. If you do it, it only gets BTC more centralized as most of us won't run full nodes when Blockchain is a few terabytes large. Take a look at BCH, large blocks but half empty..

Hello RedditCEO!
I was in the same situation like you, I bought at 6k and then it dropped to below 4, it literally dropped right after I bought. I set myself a bookmark sometime when BTC was trading at 4298,83 and I remeber checking it every day and thought it would never go above the 4298,83 again.. I still have that bookmark.
Hold onto your coins, Lightning is coming and I am sure that this dip is gonna be over soon. More important: Diversify. Now that basically all coins are at a 20% discount, buy the ones you like, look into them and diversify your crypto portfolio.

There are no chargebacks in cryptouniverse. If you used Electrum, you were your own bank, so you are responsible for security. Frankly, 20 BTC in Electrum? Thats 300.000$, a Trezor costs 100$, it should have been worth it...
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:02:36
That's horrible advice! OP, do not ever ever ever ever take out a loan and buy a highly speculative asset with it! might partially be true because NOW BTC is rising stronger than a 15% loan p.a. so you're better off taking out a loan NOW, but it would be very foolish to think that this would go on for the next years, nobody knows that for sure!
Eventually, you will find yourself with your loan invested in BTC, it's value potentially going to 0 and you cannot even pay back the principal because all your investment was placed on bitcoin.. So please.. Sell now and buy back later but never ever take out a loan and buy a highly speculative asset with it.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:06:17

Yeah but you do that once. Say, you transfer 5000$ in BTC to GDAX, you pay 20$ fee once (or less, Idk current fees) and then trade those 5k$ until you lose it all or you want to cash out or whatever
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:26:56
Go on, sell. But before you do this, open a BTC-USD chart of your choice and scroll out a week or better, a month. ;)

Trading was possible for a few minutes and BCH got pumped up to 6500$. So there actually were people who sold at 6,5k$ and people who bought, then Coinbase stopped the trading. That's another reason why many people are angry at them, because they feel like some trades knew, pumping the price hard and then unloading their BCH.

I would definitely set myself a price goal on which you will sell, not all of it of course. For me, it's when I doubled my initial investment. I got in rather late (4000-6000$), so when we are around 10-11k I will probably sell.

Careful, bitcoin.com is advertising Bitcoin Cash as the real BTC, take their information with a grain of salt. For beginners I recommend Electrum or Exodus, which are software wallets, easy to handle etc. Send a small amount to your wallet of choice and get used to it. Try to restore it from a backup. Dont send everything you own there before you know how it works.

I work in the online advertising industry and I have noticed that since early 2018, there are regular (2-3 times a month) events where blockchain is discussed. Not particularly bitcoin of course, but blockchain and especially the changes it might bring to the online advertising.

Try opening an account on coinbase, then pay the funds directly to "GDAX" (their exchange, no need to open another account there, as you already own one from coinbase).
described it pretty good (I have not paid any fees yet investing in BTC. ACH transfer to Coinbase - free, transfer to GDAX - free, stop limit buy order - free, transfer to Ledger wallet from GDAX - free.)
Depending on where you are, you might also use Bitpanda or Bitfinex or Poloniex

I mean, just think about it: Would you have guessed right how big the internet can get 20 years ago? 10 years ago I received my first "smartphone", which was a Sony Ericcson and I was proud that it *could* access the internet, allthough it was ridiculously expensive.. Nowaday, we have Netflix, Spotify and Amazon on Demand which don't even "cost" you any internet volume from your provider in many countries..

Yeah, at a peak time I paid around 20€ for a transaction.. I imported my keys to electrum and only paid around 9€. Still a lot, sure, but almost 60% less than with Exodus.. I chose to use them because of their nice interface but not even letting the users regulate the fees on their own is just a no-go for me.. The 9€ confirmed in 2-3 hours though, which was more than enough for me

I do not know Bread myself, but I guess so. With your seed phrase (the 24 words or so you wrote down when initially creating the wallet) you "own" the private keys, basically you can restore them through this phrase. I am not sure how Bread will handle the BitcoinGold fork though, and IF and WHEN they will upgrade their software to let you access your Gold.
@_date: 2017-10-09 09:41:24
They already confirmed supporting it. I believe you can even chose which blockchain to use right now. I do not own a HW Wallet though, so dont take my word for granted.

Sure, because you can say with 100% certainity that a certain stock will be worth more in a few years.. You can, right?
@_date: 2017-10-20 08:59:05
Yeah, you are right. The Only problem is: If you put a limit order at lets say 5,000 USD, the order will get executed at the NEXT available price. So if there is a drop from 5635 USD (right now) to 4500 for just a very brief amount of time (just a few minutes) you will fill the next open BUY order between 5000 and 4500, which might not be the best if you just bought at 5635. Bitcoin is very volatile, I personally would not set any sell orders and leave my coins on the exchange. You never know if its just volatility or if something terrible happens, once your coins are gone they are gone and you might have to buy back the next morning at like 5700 again.
Plus, as you might have heard already: You own the keys, you own the coin. You leave your coins on an exchange, the exchange owns your keys, they own you a PROMISE to give you the coins if you request them. You will not get any BitcoinGold after the october hardfork either. Google the Story of Mt. Gox as well, got hacked, people lost millions of bitcoins, majority of those people hasn't seen any coins as of today..

Its okay, you made your point. Now you can go back to your "Garliccoin".
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:37:46
The exchange doesnt know how much bitcoin you have. the exchange sent the bitcoin to the wallet. Now the Wallet "knows" how much you have, so the coins should be in your wallet, as soon as your developer updates it/your claim your coins in another way, which will be discussed a lot here after the fork. I am sure, If you are active here, you will know HOW and WHEN to claim your coins.

Read yourself through the Sub my friend.
1.) Buy Bitcoin (Kraken, Coinbase, Bittrex are all good exchanges, just google which one you like)
2.) Download Electrum or Exodus (multi coin wallet), which are both great and user friendly
3.) Transfer the Bitcoin from the Exchange to your wallets.
4.) Wait and enjoy the ride.

You have to validate yourself there, if you buy more than 500$ worth of bitcoins I think
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:02:06
So, what is the exact problem you are having? From what I have read, you already have the wallet.dats, but no way to connect them to a pc, right? Thats why you have to wait for tomorrow? And the PWs are also in the excel file, right?
Best thing would probably be to set up a completely new PC and download a full node (which would take a while) OR download Electrum. Its a well known wallet, doesnt contain any viruses (as far as I know and many of this sub are using it as well, noone ever had a problem with it) and then import the wallet.dat's in Electrum

I understand! Ive just gotten into bitcoin a few months ago, but I can imagine how you might feel. Well, I believe you still know the term hardfork? There is one coming at the end of october and another one in november. If you plan on selling your bitcoin, do it before the second hardfork in november. The second fork doesnt have replay protection inbuilt, so we are not sure HOW to send bitcoins after the fork, without potentially risking to lose all our coins. The first hardfork will "generate" a new currency, BitcoinGold. Its the same story with BitcoinCash, if you know that one. You own Bitcoincash, since you kept your coins before the last hardfork. In order to withdraw them, you would need to move all your existing Bitcoin to a new wallet though, which you probably wont do now, so I would take my time and just leave the BCC be.
Here is a list of wallets you should not use: 
Have you already ordered a Hardware Wallet? (Trezor or Ledger Nano S for ex.)
@_date: 2017-10-09 07:36:33
Buy BTC. The only ones mining right now are big Companys with server farms and ASIC Chips worth several million dollars. If you got 5k, buy a hardware wallet, for ex. a Ledger Nano S or a Trezor, a paper wallet would be too risky for me, especially for a long term investment.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:28:30
Exodus is the one I use and it wont follow the "New Blockchain" in November. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:00:58
Did you find them yet?
@_date: 2018-03-02 06:27:18
You do not even know the country they are located in..
@_date: 2017-10-09 09:40:18
Dont keep in on an exchange. Move it to Electrum/Mycelium or another wallet, where YOU keep the private keys/seed phrase. No wallet knows anything, the blockchain knows the amount you keep on your wallet and so you will have the same abount of Bizcoin as well.
