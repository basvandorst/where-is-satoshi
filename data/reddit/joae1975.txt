Funny thing he'll never comprehend is bitcoin is a product of corrupt politicians and the fed.  Free people will always find a way.  He wants to take our liberties so we can't fight back.  Typical.  We knew a politician would come out, he's just the first.  I just sent him a polite email pointing out his flaws.
@_date: 2014-03-06 08:21:09
If btc gets to 10k or 100k, everyone will sell at once and it will collapse.  It's a huge bubble.  I'll hold a few just in case, but I buy gold/silver w most of my mined btc.

Yes, the coins were deposited into a "watched key."  Not hard to guess for a bot.  It's not krypotkit's fault.  If I would have created the key with random mouse strokes, I would not have this problem.  I don't know what I was thinking when I created the wallet.  I must have been doing something else, multitasking, and wasn't thinking...obviously.  It was an 18 character, all lower case, and only in the upper 2 rows of the keyboard, with patterns.  My computer is NOT infected.

@_date: 2014-02-15 20:28:37
It was all lower case in a pattern.  I'm not going to say what it is, but it's very predicable by a bot.  Honestly, when I made the brainwallet for KK, I didn't make it very secure.  My initial setup on my imac was for GPG messaging, not bitcoin.  A month went by, I did make a KK btc wallet on my macbookpro securely and was using that.  I decided to withdraw some btc from btc-e to KK on my imac.  I didn't think anything of it.  2 seconds after the btc hit my wallet, they were gone.

I made a brainwallet consisting of "asdfghk..." a sequence accross the keyboard or something like that.  Then, forgetting I ever did it, I sent 18+ btc to that address.  As soon as they hit it, POOF!  Gone!!  A bot watching the brain wallets keys must have detected it.  See tx here:
Notice how they were gone the instant they hit.

Don't need to goto New Zealand to open an online account with ANZ.  Can do it from US.  Fill out online application.  A representative will call you, explain the step to set it up.  They'll ask you to wire 10k NZD (~$7000 US) to establish the account.  You'll then have to mail them notarized copies of your passport and utility bill.  When you're verified, you're done.  Then use  to send bitcoin to your NZ account.  Wire the money back to the US.

Most coworkers I talk to about it think it's only used to buy drugs online.  They're afraid using it will put them in jail or flag them as a terrorist.  The media has done a good job at demonizing Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-16 13:20:45
They should all be banned.  I heard all coinbase users are terrorists.
@_date: 2016-05-29 02:59:33
I NEVER leave coins in coinbase.  I withdrawal immediately every time.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:10:36
When will people stop using coinbase?  Too many horror stories.
@_date: 2015-10-28 00:41:25
Well, one good thing about BCI is you own your keys.  So you can only blame yourself if you lose Btc.
@_date: 2015-10-28 00:30:56
So what, I lost $11k worth.
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:38:40
Nothing.  No one will do anything to track down your bitcoins unless it's millions of dollars worth.  I had 18 btc stolen a few years ago and no one would help me.
@_date: 2016-07-10 07:32:26
Me too, no problems here
@_date: 2013-12-28 05:18:19
So now that's clears. What does the IRS say about liquidating mined bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-30 02:07:32
Neptunes are sold out.
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:48:15
So the other 600,000,000 Indians with a bank account can then buy bitcoin.

Tom Woods accepts it. And his show site is integrated with Peters.  Peter knows it's easy, he's just acting silly on his show.  I'm waiting for his metals company to accept bitcoin.  I told them, if you can't beat 'em, join 'me. I think Peter's coming around.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:18:05
Yeah, I though $300 was sick!!
@_date: 2016-07-16 05:10:27
I always withdrawal into my phone's wallet as soon as I buy them and spend them from the phone.
@_date: 2013-12-16 07:05:38
BFL replaced my 2 broke Jaly PSU's rather quickly, email john

This is Helicopter Ben's last hurrah.  Janet Yellen will put the pedal to the metal.  Either that or blame the crash on Ben.
@_date: 2013-12-25 15:40:09
$2k, LMAO!!!  
@_date: 2013-12-31 08:34:23
The PSU's often fail too.  They're sending you a new PSU to save you the trouble of another RMA.  What great customer service!!!
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:34:28
Buy gold/silver with bitcoins and sell it at coin shops.
@_date: 2013-12-30 02:07:06
Like a Ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:29:16
I'm on btcguild w 1.2th, after next dif change in 2 weeks, I'm going solo
@_date: 2013-12-28 09:28:36
That's it!! Next phone is an Android.  The strawon the camels back has been broken for me. I can't wait until my iPhone 5 dies.
@_date: 2013-12-25 09:01:05
Governments running with their tale between their legs.

We don't believe you, show us your private key. :P
@_date: 2013-12-30 02:11:53
I was gonna say $4000 btc but heads here are saying $100k and shit.  I hope I'm wrong.

"Internet fad?"  The illuminati is really trying hard on Jeopardy lately.
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:45:05
I thought about giving people paper wallet tips.  But honestly, most people will either scoff at it or lose it.  So I just don't waste my btc on them.  When main stream adoption occurs, btc tips will be more relevant.
@_date: 2013-12-14 07:18:41
I was just in a Korea and no one speaks English.  They generally don't like Americans there. That's the impression I got.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:13:19
I had a compliance officer from Wells Fargo call me once and ask me if I'm selling Bitcoin. I told him no... Then closed my account.
