It would make me naive to think you’d actually stick to your end of the bargain 
@_date: 2018-06-15 08:32:02
Thank you for proving that you’re unable to put your money where your mouth is
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:28:37
Just the ever closing distance to the ground?, yeah. Ok.
@_date: 2018-06-15 17:46:37
Good one.
@_date: 2018-06-13 00:14:39
Wanna make a bet?
January 1st 2019, if bitcoin doesn’t hit $20k you owe me $20k
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:35:24
Pretty useless in an argument where you’re trying to disprove the fact that bitcoin’s price is going down, yeah.

I missed out a few words, edited
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:52:16
Sure, go ahead, bet an amount and i’ll accept.
@_date: 2018-06-14 11:21:24
Because no one cares about the tech, they want free money.

Old enough to make non-empty propositions.
If you don’t mind, I have your mother waiting outside.
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:55:14
You’re the one giving me worthless graphs.
I have gym now. Talk to you in an hour ok?
@_date: 2018-06-13 01:48:57
Reckon I should accept if I raise to $200k if bitcoin doesn’t reach $20k
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:48:37


Is that why we haven’t hit $20k twice?
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:40:46
Sure. 9 years. If i’m right you owe me $10,000
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:52:33
Bitcoin is declining.
Bore off.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:59:52
Shhhhh it’s ok the denial hasn’t set in for you yet.
Feel free to talk to a robot.
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:27:58
It hasn’t reached $0.00000000001 and stayed there for a year.
@_date: 2018-06-13 00:53:32
Idk you tell me
@_date: 2018-06-13 08:40:31
No, it means i’m not a dick that gets greedy.
Sorry to disappoint 
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:07:20
Crypto isn’t a currency. It never will be.
Sure , you can trade bitcoin for items at a store, but that’s not why everyone gives a fuck about it. They’re in it to make a profit. Simple as. 
Bitcoin will gradually decline in price. It’s not going to hit $1 million, and it’s certainly not going past its peak back in January. It will slowly die off and be killed permanently when the next money making scheme is invented.
Edit: Anyone who wants to place bets, hit me up.

“Hey bill i want you to look something up, has the price of bitcoin risen since February?”
It was a good attempt to bullshit an argument using statistics, unfortunately , it doesn’t work. Sorry.
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:04:16
You could at least link them

@_date: 2018-06-13 15:06:21
That’s not the price of bitcoin graph
@_date: 2018-06-15 17:49:15
It’s ok dude, i’m just impressed that you’re still here given how you can’t back up your statements at all.
@_date: 2018-06-13 09:55:26
Then I should ask for money, but you don’t have any. There’s no point.
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:16:49
I don’t think i’ve ever seen gold being traded in for groceries irl
@_date: 2018-06-15 17:51:53
You know for a guy on a crypto currency sub, you sure do act like an imbecile.
@_date: 2018-06-18 12:49:09


Is that why the price is always dropping
