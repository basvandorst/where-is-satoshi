Yes it's still happening.  He had successful transactions for the most part up until May but June/July has been a problem for him. He's spent tends of hours trying to resolve the issues.

Coinbase appear to be all kinds of broken. I know people who have money stuck on Coinbase. One of them has $100,000 there in fiat. They won’t let him move more money to coin base, they won’t let him take it off of Coinbase. They have not been helpful. Like you they say you need to speak to a person further up the line and when eventually he did get a callback they were not helpful. There is no information in their account, on the website or with a human that tells him why his money is stuck there. He added PayPal and set up a withdrawal. The system said max 20,000 so he did that. Then the system said you can’t do that maximum 6500 so he did that. Then the system said you can’t do that either. It’s a mess. I recommend you go somewhere else if you can.

They seem all kinds of broken. If you look in the Coinbase Reddit you’ll see lots of issues and no one helping. I know people whose money is stuck there. One friend has $100,000 stuck there in limbo. They won’t let him withdraw it, won’t  explain what the problem is.  He is fully verified and has done large transactions successfully before. Honestly, I think it is just that they’re having technical issues. Perhaps they are overrun and don’t have the staff. Whatever it is, a lot of people are finding their money stuck at Coinbase.  And are not getting any help.

Lol he is a lawyer. Yes he has however I don’t think it is as simple as that. To start with, they probably have sign up terms that are very favorable to them. However, he was comparing it with embezzlement.
I think there are going to be a lot of cases against coin base.
They are sandwiched into a difficult position. Not only do they have the technicalities to deal with. I’m sure there is a lot of pressure on them from existing institutions like banks and government. I don’t think business is easy for them.
A Rock and a hard place.

They have been asking all sorts of personal questions of people such as what do you do, how much do you earn etc. Information that has nothing to do with buying and selling cryptocurrency‘s.

If you mean transferring out of Coinbase they have set fees I believe.
@_date: 2019-07-08 01:19:53
As you’ve noted. Stay away from Coinbase.

I recommend you get started because it may take you a while. But fingers crossed it happens smoothly for you.
That friend with 100,000 stuck there was fully verified. Had done transactions in the tens of thousands the previous month.
The worst thing is they are not explaining why. They are unavailable to help. Leaving him in the lurch whilst preventing him from doing anything with his money

Buy crypto.today. It’s in the article They linked. But be super careful, there are many scams.

It doesn’t have to. If you do it at the right time of day etc. however if you are transferring out of an exchange often they charge a larger fee for the transfer. Partly to ensure the transfer happens right away. If you have time on your hands it doesn’t have to cost much.

Also watch lots of antonopolous videos.

Absolutely except that the noise from miners is pretty extreme. Not a jet but pretty close.

Depends on the rate of your electricity.  Houses pay a much higher rate than industrial.  And if you get the right machine (low j/hash) it can work. Or if you have a situation where you don't pay for electricity.

Yes binance took $5 today for a small withdrawal. I think current btc mining fee is about.30 - $1 isn't it? Without batching.

That’s the thing about bitcoin. Bit pay can’t stop you from donating to the Hong Kong Free Press. Nobody can. No regime, no bank.

This guy has a ton of vids answering your question.

That's simply an engineering solution.
