You say that is if that were true, yet the effectiveness of technical analysis is still highly controversial.
For instance, the efficient market hypothesis is in direct contradiction with what you are arguing. 
My question to you is, if the efficiency of technical analysis in regular markets hasn’t been proven yet, what tells you it will magically work in crypto markets?

If we could infer price from graphs we would all be millionaires.

No. I suggest you pick up a copy of [A random walk down wallstreet](
A famous quote from the book: “A blindfolded monkey throwing darts at a newspaper’s financial pages could select a portfolio that would do just as well as one carefully selected by experts.”
Also read responses to the book. Both in favor and critiques of it. Do your own research, then come to your own conclusion.

If we all would type out what we think could happen without presenting sufficient evidence to support those arguments, what would we be doing?
Oh right, that’s basically r/bitcoin.
I’m just pointing out that messages like the one I first responded to have no empirical value at all, and therefore I would not even call them predictions. People are just typing out random words or feelings.

Based on...? Right, sentiment.

I’m so done, you’re still talking about support levels lol

There might be some merit to TA in very certain scenarios, but I indeed think it leans more to the the side of luck.  Hence why index funds have outperformed almost every actively managed fund ([source](
A quote from the article:


This aligns mighty well with the efficient market hypothesis. Instead of looking at patterns in data to predict the future, look at the data and accept that TA does not work.

Why would it matter that no merchants accept it at the airport if the point is to hold?
