If you want the argument itself, take a hike over to 4chan, not here.

Streisand effect.

I have strong doubts that this man is directly involved. Who ever wrote the white paper (either a person or group of people) clearly was not Mr. Nakamoto, but probably used his name out of some sense of reverence or respect.

Here, you dropped this: /s
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:36:14
How? I cannot imagine, at the moment, the steps that must be taken for this to happen.
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:22:56
Time to shave off the rest!
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:39:19
Well don't say "like pennies" since the connotation is there. Just say "like tearing a dollar in half and each half still carrying value".

I'm sure it's possible with enough massaging to run anything through Tor, just don't expect it to be blazing fast.
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:23:40
Blocks are 1MB each, for 1 block every 10 minutes, it would take 100 years to reach ~5 terabytes. It ain't happenin' bro.

Well, at the time, he threw away about 6 bucks. So, it's not really a waste, unless you're one to care about 6 bucks.
I don't understand all this pissing and moaning about all the things that should have happened.

Thanks. I am just way way too tired right now :/ I should probably sleep and study better in 9 hours.

It's funny because actually tracking bitcoin transactions through the blockchain would take less than a minute, and the rest of the movie/show would be spent tracking the address's owner down.

I want to buy btc on btc-e and sell them on coinbase. Buying them on coinbase seems backwards.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:43:09
It seems like every coinbase user has an upper limit on btc purchases for the week. So they've run out of coins to allocate freshly to their users, but each user merely has an allocation with no renewal as of now.
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:12:20
Seems like an interesting idea. How's this supposed to work?
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:00:30
This is Ground Control. We read you, Major Tom. Over.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:30:20
Damn right. Hindsight is a bitch, but hindsight of today is yet to happen.

After it gets more support, the same stuff I use my debit card/cash on.
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:11:13
btce questionable? ehh, i've had no problems moving btc into or out of there. just because it's not usa-based is a meaningless issue.
at this point, if they did anything really sketchy it would be more counter-productive than anything else; the 0.2% transaction fee probably rakes in enough money for them that it would be very smart to stand as reputable as possible.

You'd have to ask him, since that's what I assumed he meant. But as long as I've had a bitcoin wallet, this has been true.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:36:25
At this point, is there a difference between calling it a currency or a commodity? I'd argue that nearly any limited currency is a commodity.

Upon having found a brainwallet, how does one remove the coins from it?
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:44:09
A vast improvement. So how are you guys going to implement this? It seems pretty technical.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:02:29
I think he means the majority of wallets have less than 1 bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-25 08:29:26
How does one move money onto btc-e?
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:01:56
I was under the impression that mining difficulty was always adjusted to be profitable, and as such, the incentive to mine would be ever-present.
@_date: 2013-12-03 09:47:56
What a shitty article.
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:32:22
Bitcoin doesn't really have a privacy feature, unless you count address generation as an anonymity. The blockchain keeps a record of every single transaction, with every single address.
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:52:13
You can have your own, personal wallet separate from coinbase. Just go to bitcoin.org and download the software.
@_date: 2013-12-15 22:48:18
You're goddamn right it will.
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:43:03
No, I don't understand. Please explain or link me to the relevant info.
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:28:53
this says I should invest 112% of my money.
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:50:04
Nice beard.
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:34:27
Namecoin is really nice because it doesn't try to be a currency, just an alternative DNS. I like Peercoin for it's clever avoidance of a 51% attack which bitcoin is vulnerable to.
I'm sure sometime in the far future, bitcoins will be replaced by some other much more interesting currency. But anytime soon? Unlikely.

I got lost frequently, reading the convo that was posted. I have a tiny screen :(
