I'm actually very open to the idea of doing an art/design book (especially since I'm planning on trying to get a foothold for this company in comic shops, and they tend to be open to those sorts of projects.) I'm not sure if I'm quite ready to do a full-scale print run for an art/design book, since I haven't tested the market for them yet. I'm trying to scale this company up relatively slowly, but it shouldn't be too cost-restrictive to do a small-scale test run of something, if it fits with the general types of projects Bottlecap Press will be doing. PM me some links to your work and maybe we could discuss it.

But in that scenario, say a person buys 20,000 bits. That's about 10 bucks worth, AKA hardly enough to buy almost anything. But it sounds like enough for a first go. To a new bitcoin user, what's the point in having a million units? 20,000 sounds good enough. But then they buy it and realize it's not enough to really do anything with, and there could be a risk that they'd be turned off bitcoin entirely. We're certainly better off with a mainstream crowd that hasn't bought bitcoin yet because of the price than we are with a mainstream crowd who already tried and disliked bitcoin because they didn't buy enough of it to be of any use. Also, with values that high, people might get the idea that bitcoin is "cheap," and thus, not worth their time and effort.

Why are you people downvoting someone who just wants a rational explanation of how bitcoin works? This subreddit, as weird as this may be, is the public face of bitcoin and we should be here to inform. you are lucky, because you still have that a-ha moment where you realize why bitcoin *just makes sense* ahead of you, and that's a moment many of us here wish we could relive. Read up on bitcoin mining, consensus, and decentralized trust, and it won't be long before the pieces of the puzzle start to come together. Start at the bitcoin wiki at bitcoin.it - though the site may not be perfect, it's a good jumping off point into the rabbithole that is cryptocurrency. Happy trails, friend

Nah, he's selling em for bitcoin, so it's relevant. Maybe we need a new subreddit for bitcoin merchants/artisans though, since this one has been mostly news for these last several months. I for one miss the days of "my awesome small biz just started accepting btc!"

What if it created an online wallet and automatically prompted the recipient to change the password the first time it's opened? Sending a link as opposed to actually transferring the file. Would maybe use the phone number from their device for first-time authentication so the app knows they're the correct recipient.

Why would he do that? Now it's lost forever because you wouldn't download a car.

I think this is an excellent idea simply because it would generate extra interest in the charity itself. Imagine the headline "you can now send money to *this organization* just by pointing your phone at the tv!" The bitcoin boost would just be a side effect of something that could be an all around good publicity stunt (and also a useful tool) for the charity.

Yeah, at this stage anyhow. When I scale up, I haven't decided whether I'll be getting more people on board to make them by hand like this, or if I'll end up streamlining production into something faster.

I think the best bet is to probably just not tell my mom about bitcoin, and then make something up in a few years when she asks how I suddenly became rich. Sometimes it's just better to not bother explaining when you know it's someone you could never possibly get on board. I mean, it's 2014 and she's still skeptical of the concept of independent music, hahaha

Actually, very much so. Attempting POD with an older book (a little collection of short stories and poems), I was charged over 700 dollars for 125 copies. So of course, profit margins wound up being razor thin and in the end, I couldn't even break even. Making these myself, the supplies only add up to a couple dollars per book (after you've already got a printer), cutting costs by quite a lot. And it doesn't take as long as it would seem, at least not after a few days of practice.
@_date: 2014-09-01 08:39:23
That's true, but that's because that's what they're used to. Changing the standard denomination is only going to validate the all-too-common baby boomer claim that bitcoin is nothing more than monopoly money, even if that sounds insane to someone who's in the know.

I'm thinking this would primarily be for those moments when there's just not time. Let's say you're out drinking with friends and you realize you don't have any cash on you. It would allow you to instantly spot your friend some BTC to cover your bill, even if they don't already have a wallet. Or someone gives you a ride and you want to pay for gas, but there's no ATM around. Those last minute moments like that.
@_date: 2014-05-22 07:03:43
Yeah. I'm in the same boat (minus the doge, hahaha)- 24, idealist, concerned about the future but not so concerned that I'm wouldn't be willing to give the whole high risk high reward thing a shot, especially when taking that chance on a technology this damn *cool.* Even if crypto fails, one day we'll look back and think "that was interesting and I'm glad I was a part of it."

It's a 24 hour waiting period between purchases, and there's a monthly limit also. It did its part in getting me into the whole bitcoin thing, but I honestly wouldn't recommend it because their fees are unreasonable compared to the other exchanges, and the deposit limits really are a nuisance.

Yep, that's why I picked 35 cents specifically, because I had just signed up to sell the book on Amazon and 99 cents just doesn't seem fair for a digital file to me. It's whole number bias at its worst, I think. A whole dollar (and that's what I think of 99 cents as), even if it is just the change in your pocket, feels like you're giving something up. 35 cents is the sort of change I know I'll never miss. Most people wouldn't even bother to pick 35 cents up off the street if they saw it lying there. So I really feel like it's a privilege being able to sell my book for an amount of money that most people wouldn't think twice about, but that could add up if enough people are interested. Everyone wins indeed.

Well, to stick with the topic of the thread, maybe that could be implemented using bitcoin! Something like a tip bot that uses micropayments (down to the single satoshi level so people could use it for just fractions of a penny in USD) and keeps a running total of the user's tips. The mods could apply different flair next to the user's names based on their tip totals, so certain "levels" of flair could add to the user's reputation. They could also implement a system that lowers the reputation ranking when the user gets flagged for breaking the community rules/reddiquette. Not sure how easy it would be to do, but it would potentially solve the problem of folks taking unreputable users too seriously, and would make the reputable users stand out more when they have something to say.
EDIT: It could work in a similar way as karma. You use a single satoshi (or more) to "upvote" someone using this tip bot and record the upvote in a log-- not only would it be a way to mark the reputable posters on r/bitcoin, but it would sort of work as a way to make karma meaningful and subreddit-specific, maybe even eventually branching out to other subreddits, keeping track of the "karma" tips by subreddit.

"Fiat money is backed by men with guns, bitcoin is not, so why should this thing have any value?" 
It has value because it's a potential opportunity to exit a system that's forced upon us by men with guns. It has value simply because it gives the people a chance to decide whether their money has value, instead of being fed a bunch of bullshit by authority figures that we don't necessarily trust. Is it just me, or did he answer his own question?

Amazon has an option to sell the book there without exclusivity for a lower royalty percentage. The percentage definitely isn't great, but their royalties for exclusive books aren't anything to write home about either. If he selects the non-exclusive option (do not enroll in KDP Select), he can sell it anywhere else for whatever currency he wants to sell it for.
Source: I'm a writer with a non-exclusive ebook in the kindle store that I also sell myself for bitcoin.

Is there any chance you might be willing to do an AMA on this subreddit? There's been so much negative sentiment circulating here because of those few very vocal folks regarding banks and buying BTC on Coinbase and elsewhere, and I'm wondering if you were to make an AMA thread, it might calm a lot of people's nerves on these topics. I know that in general a lot of the people here definitely have Coinbase related questions and a good ole' fashion AMA would probably clear a lot of qualms right up.
Also, as a Coinbase user who has had no issues, keep up the good work.
