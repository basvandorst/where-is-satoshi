How many shaves is that?

Like watching the Star Citizen millions flying by early on. Unbelievable and exciting!

Getting chopped up, crushed, or blown up into 100 million little pieces.

Well, the 12 isn't really a spoiler. The identities of the final 5 is, though.

Agreed.... It wasn't over 4k for more than a day. Why be concerned when it drops back to where it was after a little jump?

Water has same max speed as every other massive thing: nearly C.

In general, everything is moving away from everything else. However, relative to any specific galaxy, nothing is moving faster than C. Also, not every galaxy is moving away from every other galaxy. In fact, our Milky Way is on course to [collide]( with the Andromeda galaxy.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Maybe you're thinking of something [like this]( where the excessive speed is something of an illusion. As the galaxies travel through space, the space they just traveled through expands. If you don't account for the expansion, this makes it appear as if the galaxy traveled a bit further than it actually had and, thus, was traveling faster than it actually was.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Another way to think of it: Measure the distance between us and another galaxy to get D^^1. Wait a bit and then measure again for D^^2. Normally, D^^2 - D^^1 would give a distance to calculate the speed of that galaxy. However, you're also including all of that space between us and that galaxy in the equation. In the time between measurements, all of the space between us and that galaxy has grown and makes D^^2 larger than it should be.

You're thinking short term. In the end times, the mark of the Beast will be a "[B]( It'll be a long time coming, but after many forks with small/incremental revisions A Bad Thing will happen.

I did get the reference. The mark would be a tattoo, or such, located over the implanted RFID tag which has your BTC wallet number. I was just feeling lazy and not wanting to overly-explain my idea in a post made mostly in jest.
