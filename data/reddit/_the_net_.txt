One that could facilitate a screencap of the receipt showing 1฿/$5 went to EFF would be an example of why it needs the human touch.
The more i think of it this example is a risky escrow. While the escrow can say NO REFUNDS, the buyer can still lose if the person then quickly executes the Bundle code once the transaction is signed off by both parties and funds released.
On the other hand, unless the escrow checks the code is **valid** first, its might have been used, or not bought and faked. Its not exactly a very tangible product that can be verified/trusted (if the escrow enters the code to check it gets registered and invalidated?)
So, is this example flawed then... hmm.
I suppose the question still stands is there any escrow services for *situations* **like** *these*? Or is there too many minefields (like the one above) for it to be worth peoples *hassle*...

This is the kind of attention Bitcoin deserves more of. So its not just seen as a cryptoanarchist, black market, currency of the underworld.
Edit: Then i read the title of the article its from... *sigh*
IEEE=legitimacy/publicity? Nope. Opens with=smut/anarchy.
At least it really explained it well, and ["The Future of Money"?](

Good advice. I know where to go, some good bitcoin friendly vpns/vps' remembered, how to secure all the steps anonymously, its on the... to-do list. Its growing.

Bitcoin and precious metals are both danger money though. This will be unpopular here, but the *Dollar* (local islands will readily accept) - Yen, or Norwegian Krone would be good for pure stability. But if its a closed economy, all that wont matter, "that costs 3 shiny pebbles whether its gone up in value or down in the outside world" kind of thing. [And bitcoin has lots of security benefits, when *well implemented* [no easy feat], that you lack without bank vaults.]
But if you are keeping fully connected with the outside world, which i expect you would, it could play havok with your economy, to have danger money as your currency.
I know you will have thought of this. But its something to think real hard about. Or you'll end up with a de facto oligarchy pretty fast... :P [Unstable currency benefits the economists and speculators, not the workers].
I might subscribe actually, just to get an idea of how you wish to run the island... starting out with Anarchy? Pure Democracy? Dictatorship? Man that would be fun, you could have paintball-coup d'etat's every Saturday afternoon to settle political unrest. I'll shut up now...

Lol. Can't make minds up whether its Darknet or Deepweb? 
*Darkweb.* People *get* 'web' - and 'deep' just isn't edgy enough.
Seeing this isn't posted to i'll [laugh at it]( here.
Its funny that the hitman thing gets so much press. They're all scams. A lot of dodgy services (like thieves markets) are dead in the water. A lot of shocking websites are just trolls. [e: its /b/ with the safety off]
But the intrigue of this *darkweb* lore thats sprung up will never cease to amaze journalists and get them paid for a morbid puff piece.
Theres some very real and thriving black markets in onionland, some good and great they exist, some awful and rightfully we, the article and LEO's wish there was something that could be done (beyond anonymous DDoS ops twice a year).
Bitcoin is the currency of those black markets as much as its been currency to many interests outside of it, but it wasn't really at the centre of the article...

Thats *fantastic*. I just subscribed to see your ideas some more in my feed. This is like to me (a computer/network geek) but with nation-building. Best of luck with the enterprise!
@_date: 2012-06-01 20:06:41
Yeah, its all about trust. Businesses surmount this and get established/reputation. Not so easy for small stuff.
@_date: 2012-06-01 12:26:27
[The FBI]( are a bit more on the ball about it though of course.

Physical link? Wouldn't that be ISP surveillance *or* wi-fi? How about if encrypted through an unfriendly VPN or Tor? Maybe you mean Van Eck phreaking, getting a look at your addresses on-screen? :P
Seriously though, i think if you can secure your shit beforehand its tight. But if your btc addresses are known and tied to you, even a lot of washing prior to spending it can probably be tracked back to its origin with an hour or two in an nsa-cluster. 
Like you say, depends if they want you bad enough to stick the resources on you. 
...I sometimes wonder about these theoretical cryptonerd discussions. I mean we like security/privacy, so we discuss it in its reassuring theoretical limits by default (state powers are generally the greatest). Does this make us all sound like we're planning bank robberies, money laundering, assasinations... I'm really not sure how the Po-Lice who have no bitcoins read these convos...

How resillient are QR codes to (water/sunbleach) damage? Does printing them out at a larger size increase tolerance for bleeding edges? Could you reconstruct one in photoshop if the edges were too warped to be read (but a human could tell the proportions and reconstruct with the aid of a 'ruler'?) What if there was a little bit missing off an edge, or right in the centre due to being folded up in a pair of wet pants...
I'd like to know, because this seems like a great long-term off-line storage method. Unless it gets damaged through exposure to the elements...

I would think that wasn't common, backups should be part of a cloud computing datacentres SOP, maybe this was some double-cheapo-budget service they offered bitcoinica were using?
Rackspace have a good reputation.
@_date: 2012-05-31 20:41:51
I've heard of this for buying and selling currency/bitcoins. Didn't think of it for anything else...
Can't ask questions there about such a non-currency deal though right now as it blocks Tor. But thanks for the tip.
@_date: 2012-05-31 12:17:53
Doubt he 'hacked' rackspace, i think i heard there was a password reset involved? Which would require access to the owners email, i think... Or maybe not, maybe it was a poor password reset system/questions. Would like to know for sure. But thats not the kind of 'exploit' a hacker would brag about, its not so 31337 to simply catch em with their pants down.
@_date: 2012-06-01 18:45:48
Oh yeah. Freenode has an onion address to get in by... 
They require a nickserv registration though (well balanced counter-trolling/yet tor-supporting method). I dont IRC these days so i completely forgot how to do this shit.
@_date: 2012-06-01 12:23:07
Its a fact if criminals using tor are not under their local radar, they're generally not getting caught through tor. If more and more people over the next decade, go anonymous on always-on darknets, this will become an established paradigm in policing again, rather than more and more privacy invading methods being used to hoover up everything about everything that people say online.

I remember when it was exclusively a geek thing, then a libertarian/"audit the Fed!" thing, suddenly a gawker-potheads big thing, then a speculators big thing, then a leaping out the NYSE windows great depression big thing, before it was the thing its settled down to be now.
Its *first and foremost* a real geek thing.

What a great infographic. Theres something for everyone in there i expect. TIL the difficulty level is shaped by adding contiguous zeroes to the qualifying hashes.
@_date: 2012-05-31 19:38:18
The passphrase method is ingenious. To anyone else they're gibberish, but you could paint them into an abstract piece hung on your wall, and they'd be there for you to redeem anytime you needed to...
@_date: 2012-06-02 11:52:11
True. But i wonder how the person holding the goods (not currency) feels about risk in my example. They can't send you unfalsifiable proof of purchase, and they cant send *you* half of the goods only the full thing. Its not 50/50 risk for them, just you.
Its a really interesting, almost reminds me of cryptography, inc. WOT on freenode. In some examples the steps to take to verify each stage of the transaction would have to be thorough. The escrow service could apply the steam code to their account, verify it works, then confirm to both parties the transaction can go ahead and then gift (right word) or transfer the games to you by steam accounts, and release the bitcoin to the proxy-buyer.
I almost smell a bitcoin startup here. It wouldn't exactly be popular, or make any real money, but as part of a project when you're "feeling less lazy" might be a service that gives you some visibility helping you get a rep. Seeing you are already familiar with the process... you have a couple of friends who will +1 you already. Just an idea!
@_date: 2012-05-31 12:26:19
You're right, it really glosses over that. But it does make reference to the block(chain), though it could have explained it properly. I'm guessing thats what public ledger means, (public blockchain) right?
