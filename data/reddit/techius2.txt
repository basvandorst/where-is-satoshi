I usually wouldn't do this, but thank you so much man!
@_date: 2017-01-02 07:41:28
I don't know.

If if if.


Nothing is purely denominated in BTC. Everything is priced to be worth a specific amount in USD. Most people don't want to receive 0.0001 BTC for their drugs, they want whatever is equivalent to $250 USD in BTC. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 22:31:55
A few years ago these same so-called 'experts' said that BTC would be $50,000 by 2013.
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:51:15


Sure it does. Apple as a company didn't get rich from waiting for next year to give them money. No, they innovated now, and got money now, and now they have value. BTC won't have value if people don't want to use it, because it takes too long to get money.
Like I almost lost money when selling BTC a few weeks ago, because it took me a month to get the transaction, and in that time there could have been a big crash where I lost the value in USD. I'm fortunate that that didn't happen, but it could have happened.


That's a very close-minded approach to dealing with things.


That's something we should be researching!


No it doesn't. If there are 8mb blocks, there's still going to be nodes and miners across the world, don't worry about that. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 05:52:53
I doubt it.  -- it never reached $10,000 in 2014. This current price is because there's a bubble. There's signs of a bubble all over the place. I doubt it's going to be 2-3x as you want it to be. It'll probably hover around $500 like it did previously. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:02:18
Yes it does. You don't have an economy without currency movement. Without an economy, you have nothing. There's no value in money, there's no movement of currency. In order for BTC to thrive, you need to inspire movement again, which having high fees doesn't.


They still have enough users for it to work. And actually, if you actually read what I said, rather than taking it out of context, I didn't say that BTC had to literally copy them and have less than 1 cent fees. However, they're doing something that is better than us in terms of having quicker transactions, for a lower price. We could do the same thing, but with $1, or even $2 at most. There's no reason why a similar idea shouldn't be researched.


$5 on $1 is not common sense. That's 500% the original cost. That's not common sense at all, that's a ripoff. I remember PayPal succeeding because they had fees that costed 5x the original payment, oh wait, that's not their model and they succeeded. 
I hope you don't run a business, or anything important in a business. If you paid 5x the cost on something that doesn't deserve  that money, then I would fire you. As capitalists, we want the lowest price possible. The fees here are not the lowest price possible. The fact PayPal can offer less than $0.10 fees, yet can still make hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars annually, is testament to the fact that you don't need $5 fees. 


Then they don't agree with supply and demand. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 06:19:25
How is this shilling? It raises an important issue, which is the cost of fees. Since the price is so high, I don't want to move my money to other websites, which actually hurts the "Bitcoin economy" when others think the same as me.
For the record, I want to move about $50 -- however fees will rape about 1/10th of that, the alternative is literally waiting a month (like I did the last time I sent a transaction). 
On the other hand, it turns out I had about 1k doge somewhere. It cost me literally 1 Doge to move it, and it came at a reasonable time. They're obviously doing something better than us, at Dogecoin. I'm not calling for 1 Satoshi fees either, I have no issue with fees, but they have to be a common sense amount. There's nothing common sense about sending 1/10th of your transaction to miners.

I also made this for you and anyone else who think it's going to increase a retarded amount. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:41:08


I'm not promoting Dogecoin. I'm just saying that, in this regard, it's a superiour system. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 06:03:25
Bitcoin has no comparison to metal. Bitcoin is literally backed by nothing. Gold has actual value attached to it. Watch this to better understand my line of thinking: 
@_date: 2017-01-02 08:12:20
Long gone? It was just $500 around October, then it shot up to it's current point, just like a bubble, now you're encouraging me to buy in, which is bad advice since it's a bubble. 
I'm just being realistic here. I don't see BTC going up to $2k-3k here in the next year or whatever the original comment said.
 Next month when the price is down to $450, we'll see who's the one laughing, probably me.
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:43:18


Absolutely, but people aren't using BTC as a pure currency. It's in conjunction with what they want to get in USD, because I don't see people voluntarily getting 0.0001 BTC for drugs. No, they want whatever $500 is worth in BTC. 


I don't, which is worse. A $5 fee would be like $8 NZD for me. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:04:16


Because 1 doge is like $0.001.


I never said I wanted Bitcoin to copy what Dogecoin is doing.

I'm Satoshi Nakamoto. You think I care about remediable issues like 'what is your favourite colour'? Come on mate. I'm too advanced to think about issues like my favourite colour. Instead, I ask that you ask the question what my favourite shade of light is, how bright it is and the filter I like to view it through.
@_date: 2018-06-30 16:24:16
Why would I just have a single private key? I'm Satoshi Nakamoto. I have inter-dimensional private keys spanning multiple wallets keeping a number of Bitcoins in each wallet. I do this for security reasons. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 07:30:43
You can feel it, it's used in computer components, people use it to build. You can't do any of that with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-30 16:19:44
That's a good question. I'm glad you asked it. Thanks for asking your great question. You are a tremendous person. 
This isn't a simple question which can be answered in a binary manner. We have to analyse it and look at the bigger picture. Again, why do men have nipples? I think there's a greater reason behind this than you may expect at first sight. Allow me to explain:
I'm of the belief that the reason why men have nipples is because of the federal reserve. Since 1913, they have suppressed the value of the dollar hereby suppressing the human desire of man. The consequence of this is that men have become more feminised. Long are the days of men doing hard work and raising a family. The lizard people have taken over -- there's no other way of putting it. That within itself is another issue. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:58:31
Instant? Free?
Are we talking about the same currency? 
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:46:11
No, way past that:
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:25:32
So BTC hasn't ever had a bubble and then a collapse since the price was $300...? 
@_date: 2017-09-19 08:49:04


Most people aren't here to look at BTC from the technology side of things. Do you think Goldman Sachs or any other large bank cares about it? No. They see BTC as another stock to be traded.


Sorry, kiddo, but most people in the world have more serious things to worry about. It's only us, the people fortunate enough to live in the west, that can worry about the implications of BTC. An African or Indian is too busy and too impoverished to even consider buying a satoshi of BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:26:06
It's not 2014 anymore. Entirely different bubble we're talking about here.
@_date: 2017-09-19 11:39:10
\&gt;No, we are not in a bubble.
Being this far in denial.
@_date: 2017-10-19 07:29:24
I just checked it. It's at $13,219 NZD which is $9,312 USD.
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:31:34
 you were too late to see this recovery.
@_date: 2017-09-19 12:05:06


Yeah. It's got something to do with there being constant wars, government turmoil, and there not being enough social spending. Also, it's a result of them being a farmer, just like the past 50 generations of their family. They wouldn't be earning $2 if they got educated and moved to the cities, but unfortunately there isn't even a school (as a concept) in these third world villages.


That's a problem that we Westerners can care about. What effect does it have on a peasant farmer who is already experiencing the worst of the worst? It can't get any more worse than the conditions they're in already.


A tractor? Don't get too far ahead of yourself. Most of these families are trying to save up $100 to get a pushbike. I doubt they even know what a tractor is. 


There's a need for more government social spending in the developing world. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 11:40:10


They do, but BTC isn't going to affect a Zambian corn farmer who only earns $2 a day, much like half of the world.


Why would an illiterate peasant give a shit about BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:51:35


Not if you send using friends &amp; family.


The minimum amount required on LocalBTC is like $100. I don't need that much, nor am I going to spend that much.
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:34:45


You mean we're going to find $1.3 trillion, 20x the market cap we have now, just out of the blue? This is the same dumb logic which gets us into many economic crisis, and ultimately recessions, if not depressions.
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:28:30


Implying Bitcoin is exempt from having bubbles.


And more growth and more growth is a bubble.


Like the Dotcom bubble?


Ahh, the ol' "BTC is exempt from the rules of economics".
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:36:32
It's a payment processor. Nobody ever claimed it was money. But you can use it to transfer money.
@_date: 2017-09-19 08:46:41


It's only 1/16th of the size of the US American economy. It's only larger than all of Apple's, Samsung's, Tesla's, Nokia's, and more assets combined. It's a lot.

You switched positions here. You said it was a digital currency in your first comment, now you say it's merely a computer programme, therefore suggesting it has no value, in your second post. What one is it, hypocrite? 
@_date: 2017-05-21 07:33:16
BTC isn't just a programme though. It's a currency, as you say.
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:12:12
Money can have bubbles.
@_date: 2017-05-21 06:54:21


People have been saying that for years. The truth is nobody wants to buy a currency that fluctuates $100's per day. The poor don't want to do that. The middle class don't want to do that. The rich don't want to do that. Only those who trade BTC want to do that.
@_date: 2017-05-21 07:04:24
If you see by the price of oil, you can see it quickly rise to $140, just like how BTC quickly rose to $2,000 from $900 a few months ago. It shows how the rise of the price of BTC isn't some calculated, gradual rise. It's suddenly shot up to the price it is now. It's only a matter of time before it crashes from $2k.
@_date: 2017-05-21 07:31:58
You're the complete idiot for implying that the laws of the market can't be applied to BTC, whether it be bubbles, crashes, increases or decreases
@_date: 2017-05-21 08:56:24
No it isn't.
@_date: 2017-05-09 09:17:49
Wrong.  if that doesn't scream bubble at you due to the sudden increases, just like in 2013, then you're a moron.
@_date: 2017-05-21 08:57:06
Yes, then after it hit $1k it crashed and it took 3-4 years before it hit $1k again.
@_date: 2017-05-21 07:12:15
How is it the opposite? How is it undervalued? I don't see banks suddenly doing mortgages in BTC, or supermarkets asking for BTC at the checkout. BTC isn't being valued at a point where the rise in price is to be expected. It's a bubble, and like other bubbles, there's no explanation except for greed.
@_date: 2017-05-21 08:56:53
People have been making predictions like that for years. It never happens though.
@_date: 2017-05-21 07:23:35
I'm not stupid. I clearly understand economics, graphs and data better than you.
@_date: 2017-05-21 07:29:16
It doesn't matter if BTC is a physical commodity or not. It still experiences sudden rises, crashes, increases, decreases. It's all the same when you look at it from those lense.
@_date: 2017-05-21 07:19:54
Thank you! 
Just because I say there's a bubble, doesn't mean that it's going to drop to $10 or that I hate BTC. I just mean that it's not going to stay at $2,000 for very long. I don't know how far it's going to drop. But I also don't know if it's going to rise, which is certainly possible, but it's still part of a bubble if you look at the charts.
I just want to help people that's all. People deny bubbles all the time, and before they know it they can lose everything. It's better to have an open mind about these things instead of being in your own fantasy world and denying any facts that may suggest otherwise to what you wish.
@_date: 2017-05-21 22:45:38
It still has a 20% MOE as the article says. That means the price could be corrected to $1,600.
@_date: 2017-05-21 07:55:29
How does a programme get a bubble without it having value in the first place?
@_date: 2017-05-21 07:30:03
So you're saying that it's going to rise 500% from $2k without crashing? LOL!
@_date: 2017-05-21 22:42:16
How can it crash to $4k when it's only at $2k? It has to rise first. lol
@_date: 2017-07-16 13:18:46
People say it's the last chance all the time. I don't see how this time it's any difference. "This time it's different" yeah pigs ass. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 07:26:13
$10k isn't coming this bubble.
@_date: 2017-05-21 06:55:10
Here's a bunch of charts to suggest why I think it's in a bubble: 
@_date: 2017-05-21 07:05:26
Are you stupid? Currencies/assets, whatever BTC is, can have bubbles too.
@_date: 2017-05-21 07:09:02
BTC isn't a company.
@_date: 2017-05-21 22:41:28
Just because the bubble gets bigger doesn't make it a bubble.
@_date: 2017-05-21 06:52:12
I don't have anything to gain out of selling except $50 probably. I have BTC because I'm interested in it, not because I want to back a quick buck out of it. That's not what BTC was designed for.
@_date: 2017-06-01 01:52:05
I don't want to do too much. First it starts off as $20, then $200, then $2,000. At least $2-3 can provide an hours worth of entertainment without any real loss.
