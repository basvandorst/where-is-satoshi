No change? Have u heard about the network's inability to process transactions? The soaring fees?
Denial is not a recommended approach but if u decide to stick to it, at least be careful with misleading others.

I was so moved by your story, it's beautiful that you can follow your true self despite your parents' probable stand and that Bitcoin could help you in that. For me, this gives cryptocurrencies validity and justification more than any financial argument. Just be careful with buying meds without consulting a doctor first. I don't know where u r from but if your from the states you can contact a local lgbtqia center and they will be able to assist you in that.
Thank you so much for sharing your story.

Hodl is a religion, dont look for logic, its a matter of belief only, a belief that the price will go up despite the exploding mempool, the latency, the fees problems, the speculants and the whales. Its a perfectly valid belief as the one to sell.

Amazing how your description fits my ongoing experience and probably of so many others :-)

Or they will see u at 10,000. Same validity to both options

What about opening a bank account overseas (e.g. Europe), wiring euros from your indian bank account to your new overseas bank account and then from your overseas bank account to a crypto exchange?

And these banks of other European countries do not make problems transferring to bitcoin exchanges?
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:59:20
The overseas account will be under the same  name as the indian account so there should be no problem to transfer between those two,, isn't it so?

Clearly an Achitophel's advice, if we let ourselves to be honest and put aside religiosity and our self interest as hodlers.

Arbitrage gaps between bitfinex and gadx  somehow make sense - americans are not allowed to use bitfinex and chinese are not allowed to use gdax

They charge a 4% comission

The fact that "they" control whatever doesn't say the bitcoin is not rightfully crashing. Stop using excuses for not to assesing the situation honestly

You forgot the "very long" before "time"

Based on what i see here very few, most have religious education

If you were more clever in your wish to be a millioner you would have bought venezolanian bolivar rather than satoshis

Its irrelevant if you live on the moon or believe in denial of reality

Actually segwit is very similar to adding a horse rather than impeoving the core engine

There is hardly any relevance of what happened in 2014 to 2018, the market landscape and the reasons for the collapse are different. Basing your mood on some events in the past may be convenient but is a self deception.
Instead, be frank with yourself and admit the risks involved. Don't be afraid of risks. Denial of them will only increase their impact on you and your investment.
