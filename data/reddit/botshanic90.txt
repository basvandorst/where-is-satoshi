It goes against Sanctions imposed against Venezuela. The US government has stated there will be severe legal repercussions to anyone investing in Venezuelan icos. Unless you want to lose your American citizenship  and face possible jail time I wouldn't do it.

Ok mr "you can't lose your citizenship".. have fun.

If you're not a naturally born citizen in the US you can lose your citizenship.

Can Your U.S. Citizenship Be Revoked? Although rare, it is possible for a naturalized U.S. citizen to have his or her citizenship stripped through a process called "denaturalization." Former citizens who are denaturalized are subject to removal (deportation) from the United States.

Everyone invests to gain profits. That's literally every single market. You think people invest for fun?  Blockchain is here to stay, as long as the tech is good crypto isn't going anywhere.

Also if high crimes are committed I've known people who have been deported as Mexican American dual citizenship holders.

US investors will be prosecuted by US government if they invest in anything crypto from Venezuela. When you turn in your trading history to cash out if Venezuela is in there you're screwed.

Pretty much TLDR if you go against government money you're gonna have a bad time.

You really think the big players are gonna hop on when they can manipulate first and then hop on way cheaper?
First investors have power. It costs a lot more to have the same power as them. More than it is shaking weak hands.

That's from dumb people falling for scams. and smart people scamming people trying to hop onto a good thing.
