Maybe like a lightweight virtual exchange with very limited features, have the user create an account and they start with a virtual $(whatever they choose) USD for example. They can trade between BTC/USD BTC/LTC etc, with real time prices and maybe graphs? All that would be really happening would a user doing a series of calculations, not really sure how you would get real time pricing (that would probably be the hardest part), perhaps use prices on larger real exchanges if possible.

Well you can't buy less than the transaction cost.

Can you ELI5 this. I have looked on  and read some of that massive pdf about it. On havelock investments what are you actually paying for with the 0.0025 bitcoins? Shares? Why is the price decreasing over the past 90 days? I'm not really sure, thanks in advance.

Don't worry, I believe you OP.

Virtual exchanges so we can practice trading usd/btc (maybe even other coins) without having to use real money, while using real time prices of btc.
EDIT: I am aware something similar to this exist but it isn't *great*.
