@_date: 2016-08-07 07:19:58
that was probably good, since BTC's value increased

I don't think he meant counterfeiting. Anyhow you can look at BCH as counterfeit bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:34:09
1. You mean in 2 years?
2. Why would BCH be useless? BTC has no effect on BCH's usefulness.
Come up with a decent argument and dump obsolete coins.

@_date: 2016-04-07 12:01:17
How much was that in dollars? With BTC it is the entry price that counts.
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:41:49
Was that an argument?

@_date: 2017-12-10 19:42:25
You should sell. Bitcoin had a few bear markets and it looks like a huge top right now, take the money and run. You can always buy back later and lower.

1. He isn't using the coins/money right now, so he isn't rich at the moment.
2. There is a good chance the coins are actually lost or temporary unavailable..
3. The coins could (and should) be donated and spread out increasing BTC usage. If he does that there is no reason to hate him, he would be everyone's hero....

Crashing the price? That is the goal, so why would that be a problem? 
And using the biggest 5 exchanges they could do it in 20 seconds, clearing out the books. If more buying comes in, they could keep selling...  This is the government so how much they got isn't important, the effect is...

I agree with OP. I used to like Gwern a lot, but his stock value has dropped about 80% I say. Generally speaking, any claim about X being Satoshi should be treated as a big no, for obvious reasons. Gwern should know this, so him getting behind a claim gave the claim too much credibility.
Eventually Satoshi will be revealed, but there will be some obvious and unrefutable proof for it, not some silly leaked emails and shit....

And your guess is based on what? If the goal is to make BTC volatile and to make people abandon it because frequent crashes, that is exactly the way to do it.
The market is so shallow, even 50K coins could drop it by 50-100$....

Yes, having the key in a fund without making sure nobody else has the key is pointless. I guess it is possible to transfer the coins/key in a way that both parties know there are no copies....  Also it is possible to set it up that none of the parties can use it without the other's OK....

1. Because the coins are not in use, so what is the point of having them or them being made at all?

How about the lack of communication and incredibly bad PR? They forgot to get the money transferring licence for US customers? That it took 2-3 weeks just to get a verified account back in May?
Once US withdrawals were halted/slowed down, no US customers should have used Gox. There was a reason why their price was 10-15% higher than other exchanges, that is a huge sign of additional risk. Of course greedy people moved in and wanted to take advantage of the higher price.
I knew in last November they were toxic, so anyone who sent money to them from the US after that, at the very least they didn't do due diligence. 
Also promises about Litecoin that were never fulfilled....

The dude is guilty, so to me it is irrelevant how they got the evidence. Why should the guilty party walk free for mishandled evidence? Also:
1. One person's criminal is another's freedom fighter. Criminality is relative. For half of the bitcoiners DPR is a hero, thus the whole debate.
2. See my first sentence, the dude is guilty.
3. I disagree.
I can turn your argument around: How many guilty people we allow to go free just to get 1 properly prosecuted? 1? 10? 1000?

@_date: 2014-03-28 13:22:53
Sure. My prediction is that in a few years, no digital currency will be worth more than $100, including not yet existing altcoins.
There are 2 things that can happen:
1. The idea of digital currencies take off, masses adopt and governments let them be. If this is the way, there will be even more competition, (it takes basicly no effort to create a new coin system) and that will bring the price down. Forget about uniqueness and network effect, they are overrated features. Not to mention a bitcoin killer with better features can come along at any moment.
2. Governments finally will ban digital currencies for various reasons (who likes a competitor?) and they will be an unusable, obscure "has been" historical piece of reminder. Price will be in the single digits...
Either way, there is no way price will stay in the 3 digits...
@_date: 2018-05-29 19:07:31
I bet it didn't work this year. It only works when price keeps going up, and people want to start mining.
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:35:49
The analogy is pretty damn good...
@_date: 2014-05-01 11:04:43
I am not saying the number of bitcoin users wouldn't increase (after all, they just got a HUGE market place accessable) what I am saying is that the number of Amacoin users will be way more. And vendors tend to stick with the money that is used by more people. If you are a new vendor who wants to use digital currencies and bitcoin has 1 million and Amacoin has 30 million users, which one will you implement first?

Exactly. And the market is wrong currently. Not to mention bitcoin is a currency, not a commodity.
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:37:02
The point was that a rather small amount of coins caused a huge amount of drop. You call it a shallow order book, not trolling. Trolling is when fishing boats pulling fishing nets behind them.
Now if you have trouble with reality, you shouldn't be in bitcoin. The more exchanges are there, the more shallow the order books are....

Cold wallet. Now if you refer to exchanges then yes. That's why I said it was inherently risky. But you can lessen the risk by:
1. Spread money/coins among exchanges.
2. Don't keep the coins there unless traded.
3. Don't daytrade, most people lose money by it.

Actually it quadruplied (13K vs. 51K), but compared how much more exposure and value increase bitcoin has got, 4 times more volume sounds to me too low. Volume should be 10-30 times more on a year to year basis, in the early years...
After a further check, it looks like the annual volume increase is rather stable at ~400% (2011 Jan vs. 2012 Jan vs. 2013 Jan vs. 2014 Jan)

Well, it works with stocks. Options (and futures) were invented as insurance against adverse movements. A put seller basicly sells you insurance against a price drop. The price of the put option is the insurance premium.
  Although originally it was used for producers, farmers to make sure by the time their products reach the market the same price is still valid, and options were picked up by investors and speculators later on.
Bottomline is, if it works for stocks, it should work for BTC too...

Hm, could be a good answer. But let's see the opposite thing, which is blindly holding, is it riskier or not?:
1. Price goes to the moon. Whale makes it big. But what are the chances of that happening? Price did go to the moon (sort of) when in a year went from $13 to $1200, but it didn't stay there. So the chances of a whale catching the top of the price movement and timing it right is small, not to mention cashing it all out quickly would affect the price. So slowly selling into a rally makes good sense. Now you could say, what if the whale sold at $600 a 4 months back and missed the run up to $1200? Well, missed profits is different than an outright loss, and the whale already has a built in profit, so he would have made less. In short he misses out on profits.
2. Price basicly collapses to near zero. The whale made a stand at a higher price, but still got destroyed. But this isn't different than right now when the whale is just holding like Spartans.
I know there are scenarios where the whale can lose, but assuming the whale is actually right and the $1200 all time high will be passed sometime in the near future, to me it makes more sense to try to time the market if not all of his holdings, but at least with a smaller % of them.

Let's assume they had access to the coins long time ago. Wouldn't it make sense to keep takign away smaller chunks (like 10-15 BTC) at a time and send through a tumbler instead of trying it all at once or in large splits? Even just 4-5 times a day taking away 15 BTCs ads up, and much harder to follow once it came out of the tumbler...
They might also want to test their cashing out opportunities and how well they covered their tracks.... What is the point of hacking if they let it all be sitting there???
@_date: 2014-05-03 22:12:31


In the OP I already said they would have probably their own exchange.


Companies make terrible mistakes all the time. Yahoo paid 6 billions for broadcast.com, the website that doesn't exist.


Nope, as long as it is traded, they can feed it back to the market on the exchange.


Most of them doesn't have the backing of a major retailer.  :)


What is illegal? I decide what crypto my company accepts, not the law.


It is external, people would want to buy Amacoin. I told you I would buy $500 worth immediatelly. People who spend X dollars could buy that much worth and that would be a RISKLESS investment for them.


You are still not getting it. Amazon is no different than Satoshi. And you obviously don't know how hedge funds operate or what they like.


There is no middlemen. The only difference is that we know who created Amacoin unlike with Satoshi and bitcoin. Once they release the protocol on day 30, they are just a big player like the Winklewosses now with Bitcoin, just one out of many.

I know for a fact that he has 200K bitcoin on his own. So knowing that, he could:
1. Just make everyone happy and even.
2. He could have played gox before the mallability issue and keep selling with a 100$+ profit.
3. Once price fell below other exchanges, he had enough coins/cash to keep playing arbitrage.
So if he wasn't able to make up at least 10K missing coins he is a incredibly big idiot. Even if he didn't have the 200K coins, he could have borrowed them, since he is pretty connected. 
P.S.: He had either cash or coins to arb in the last 6 weeks and make up the missing coins and make everyone even...

Sure it does. Not small exchanges and Gox at the moment, but where does Coinbase gets its price? From the exchanges! If you want to get into bitcoin, it is the exchanges that set the price. Overstock uses some exchange price to cash out your purchase with bitcoin...
I think there is a huge difference between price manipulation when you want to move the price and when you want to keep a certain price. In the former, you act actively by buying or selling huge. In the later you act passively buy putting in limit orders and wait for the price to come to you.

If they issued Amacoin at $5 and they have a huge reserve and they get coins all the time and macoin goes up to $20 (or infinity and beyond) how could they NOT profit from it?
By the way they would also profit by:
1. Increased purchases.
2. If they own the exchange by exchange fees. Obviously their exchange could get the largest in no time.
3. Just by sitting on coins as long as the value is going up.
4. By people liking digital currencies but not able to use any of them at Amazon buying products.

OK, the Winklewii lost 50% paper profits since the all time high. So why just holding it is better than semi-actively timing the market?

I don't think those numbers are correct:
1. Price fluctuated so much in the last 2 weeks, it is hard to decide what multiplier to use when you do the (BTC volume/200 X daily average price)
2. Using Bitcoinwisdom, the volume of Febr 7 was half of the previous day's volume, but according to OP, they still made twice as much in commissions. This could be if price quadriplied between those days, but it didn't...
3. Highest volume was on the 3th, but they made the most on the 7th??? (again, this can be explained if the dollar multiplier is wastly different)
Also, assuming that they traded their costumers' money (highly unethical) this would include commission paid for themselves, which is non-existing profit....

Well, whales are investing in the belief, that bitcoin will be worth way more down the road. If they wouldn't believe this, they would have cashed out already.
Now they are not just catching a falling knife but also protecting their still existing coins (because they are both having cash and coins at the same time most of the time) when they put up a buy wall. And sometimes all a crash needs, a buy wall, a sign of confidence.
Now with the sell wall, you could say they are cashing out too early and keeping the price down too much, thus they might act against their self interest. Well, yes and no. First, nobody knows how high the price would go without the whale, second, a whale can't cash out quickly anyway, so he has to spread it out and it is much more sensible to sell into a rally than into a crash. Third, he already has a profit built in so he might give up more profits, but he isn't really losing by selling into a rally...

You are wrong about the size though. A whale can own 1-2% of all coins. In stocks this usually not happening but whales like that can and do manipulate the market. (read up on the cornering of VW stocks) In the case of bitcoin the order book is so shallow, that 4000 coins crashed the price by 80% a few days ago. The Winklewii have 100K coins. They could put up a very decent wall and buying cash with that ammunition... If they had a buy order with 10K worth of cash, price would never have fallen below $500 or whatever...  Instead it went to $102....

@_date: 2014-05-26 11:59:29
OP has a good point but:
1. In a stale market, even little extra volume can cause movement.
2. Gox has been historically significant, thus when the price moves there, so does it on other exchanges.
3. Since arbitrage was nearly impossible, the other exchanges couldn't even out Gox's movement but were led like lambs to slaughter...

In this post your arguments are against cryptos in general and not specifially against Amacoin:


That is the same with bitcoin. Obviously Amazon would only start such a venture if there was some kind of government guarantee against an outright ban. But back to your question, the same excuse applies: if cash isn't responsible for heroin deals, why would bitcoin/Amacoin be held to a higher moral standard?


Why? The Treasury (issuer of cash) isn't reporting on every cash transaction.


Nothing but this is an argument against ALL cryptos, not just Amacoin.
And again, Amazon isn't the owner of the blockchain, they are just the starter of it. So they aren't obligated to monitor anything...

If Satoshi (10%) or the Twinkewosses (at least 1%) have a huge reserve, why would anyone pay more than a few bucks for Bitcoin? 
Amazon doesn't have to have a huge reserve at the end of the 30 days. they could be all out of coins. But:
1. They can still mine and they have huge resources.So they would make a large% of the new coins if they want to.
2. They would get plenty of coins from purchases and they can decide to keep the coins.
So their holdings aren't secret, not at the end of the 30 days...  Later on it is their interest/strategy to keep valuation and usage in balance

Technically (in a computer or accounting) you can divide a penny into 100 units, but it is still 100 worthless units, since you can not buy anything for a penny.
So divisibility only works if price increases up to very high. Let's say it stabilizes here around 1000$, what good your satoshi will do to anyone?
You can only count the usable (have at least minimal value) units of any currency. In case of the dollar that is penny or above....
And BTC can work as a currency at $5 valuation just fine. Although at that point the number of coins issue would come up. But people always forget about altcoins.... This is another issue, the number of bitcoins are not limited....

1. I don't exactly know, but if you look at the market depth, it is shallow and can't handle such a large order without signifficantly moving the price.
2. Sure you can still transfer but your cost is going to be 30-50% higher than before you started.
3. The utility of any currency is that it can handle large transactions. Bitcoin right now can't. Hell, the whole marketcap is a few billions, so obviously that is the very upper limit right now.

Good point, but it would depend on how hostile Amazon is towards Bitcoin. If they have an exchange but they don't list Bitcoin, other exchanges still could list it, but that would work for Amacoin, because more people want to exchange their alt coins to Amacoin, because Amazon only takes Amacoin.
So I turn over the question, why would anyone want bitcoin when Amacoin does the same and more?

Unless you have a business that generates bitcoins in the form of commissions. And since he had one, he didn't have to care about the price of bitcoin. Now had he been a banker and he just borrowed (shortsold) the BTC, then yes, you are correct.
The problem was that Gox slowed down and didn't generate enough commissions. At their very best week, they made 11000 coins in commission, but after other exchanges came online, their average went down to 2000 or so coins per week, not subtracting cost.
  So he could have still made about 100K coins per year, if there isn't a run on his bank, I mean exchange...

Everyone to move over? No need. People still use Myspace. But the newer users would sign up for a better coin, if/when there is going to be one. Also if a legit company like Amazon backs a new coin, there goes the network effect.
There was a news item today that the US Post Office was thinking of making its own coin. That would kill bitcoin real fast. I mean it would still exist and a happy few thousand nerds would trade it among themselves.
For real global business you also need more coins and BTC's 20 million isn't enough, and divisibility only works if price skyrockets (which won't happen anymore).
So just give it time, there will be a better coin....

@_date: 2014-02-28 16:12:57


But a very good argument can be made that it is. You see, if you make coins for yourself, they are worthless. If you share them with your friend, they are still pretty much worthless. The more people sign up (accept) them, the more they worth. So for your digital currency to be usable you need adopters who buy into it.

I dunno, but in 5 years they couldn't come up with a RC v 1.0???  That is slow in my book... Now if the valuation was around a dollar, that is one thing, but a beta tested half cooked something reaching $1200 is just crazy...

@_date: 2014-02-16 02:37:26
That could be one of the explanations. But again, what I described is in their best self interest. So having a very big investment and not trying to protect it somehow just let it sit and gain dust seem to me a very foolish thing to do.
Specially the Winklewii. they believe in prices of 10K and above. So when the market was overheating, they could have fed half of their coins into the market above $1000, and bought it back under let's say $800. Even if they lose money, if their belief is correct, eventually they make out like king, and if they lose 30%, it is nothing for them, because they are already up 20000% or what...
The bottomline is, playing the market isn't ideological, but self preserving. I think some whales might be affraid of actively trading or putting large amount of coins on exchanges. Some might think that buy and hold is the best, and I am not saying they should daytrade, but if I were a whale I would time it occasionally....

That takes very little effort and a huge company like Amazon has plenty of resources anyway. Look, there are new altcoins almost every day, so if a few enthusiasts can make a new altcoin, why a group of pro (paid) programmers wouldn't be able?


Even if the acceptance rate is only 1%, that would give 2 million instant users for Amacoin which is twice of the bitcoin users today. I would say at least 30% would use it, thus making a 60 million strong user base.
The less user there are, the more coins go back to Amazon in my scheme. And I am sure there would be investors who want to buy Amacoins because there is no downside:
You register to buy and get the coins for $5 after 30 days. If price takes off, you made money. If price stays around $5, you just use them and buy stuff on Amazon. It is a no-brainer and riskless investment...
@_date: 2014-04-30 15:41:20
Higher stock prices, more purchases and could be profits from the Amacoins. If they get 100 million coins back and coins take off and will be worth $10 or $100, you can do the math.

You forget that they are also making money out of it in several ways. In my scheme they make at least breakeven by the end of the year, after that if they cash out immediately after every purchase, the same thing as bitcoin vendors in general.


Every start is hard, when Amazon started out they were beeding cash for a decade. Companies do discounts and coupons all the time. If they say, for the first time you have to purchase at least $50 worth of products to use your Amacoin, that is only a 10% discount.


As with any coupons, generating sales. If you didn't plan to spend $50 in the next month at Amazon, but this $5 discount makes you do so, Amazon is the winner. If you don't spend it, it goes back to Amazon, thus no loss whatsoever.


Jeff Bezos begs to differ, but again, we aren't talking about a billion loss. You said the adoption would be only 1%, so that is 10 million bucks lost. AKA Tuesday in Amazon's term.   :)


OK for the last time I will summarize it for you:
1. Generating sales at least in the beginning.
2. Profits from mining.
3. Advertising. It isn't called Pepsicoin, but Amacoin.
4. Having a new alt coin gets usually a jump start in price as opposed to a well established older currency.
5. Prohibiting other currencies on your websales makes a monopoly. This has a price increasing effect on your own currency.
6. Having your own exchange makes profits from fees.
7. If Wall Street gets interested, it is like having a secondary stock offering.
8. Profits from mass adoption and continuously increasing prices. 
Hell, making a new coin is adventurous and hopefully profitable that's why everybody is trying to do it. The huge difference is that it is hard to get the masses to use a new coin and that is where a retailer's huge own customer base comes in as advantage not to mention the products you can have access to.
Seriously, if you aren't getting this by now, there is no reason to repeat myself. You arguments were either against cryptos in general, thus not specifically against my idea or I already addressed all of them.
Bottom line; **Everybody wants to issue the next new big alt coin, and a huge online retailer is in the best position to do so.**

I think you are mistaken. They said 80 million was the revenue of SR and when you divided the 80 mill with the price at the time of the news, you got the 600K coins. But revenue and profits are 2 different things. The 144K coins is his profits, and I think they pretty much got it all. Link to the article where it says 400% more coins are sitting somewhere...

Better? No, but simpler, yes. If security can get easier that would help tremendously with adoption. (And again, a bitcoin killer only need to have more users and more usability, not necessarily better features)


That is alright. It is the big money that counts, not the small investors. There is already interest in bitcoin, if just a few dozens of hedge funds get involved with Amacoin that would push the price up.
If you think that less than 1% of exposed people would adopt a new crypto, than it should be the same for bitcoin too, thus you shouldn't hope for mass adoption and changing the world if only 1% of people will ever use it. So you are either right about the 1% and that is still bad news for BTC, or wrong about it, than Amacoins win.


You mean just like with any other crypto?  :)
Imagine people mining bitcoins for 2 bucks and selling them for $1200... Didn't seem to hurt bitcoin... By the time Amacoin is above $10, Amazon already made back its investment.


There would be only 5 million new coins per year and:
1. Amazon also would keep mining, probably half of the new coins making profits on those coins and that profit balances the losses.
2. They have already given away 200 million coins so 5 million extra wouldn't hurt them much more.


The price guarantee is just temporary, so people don't have to be afraid of a sudden loss while the adoption gets under way. After a year it is a free for all.


They have lost billions during the last 18 years, and their stock is still at $300.   :)


Again, there is a sudden influx of huge number of possible users, a temporary price guarantee and the possibility to spend your crypto at the largest online store. If those are not enough incentives for a vendor to adopt Amacoin, I don't know what they need.


Overstock is big enough on its own, but if you are a small vendor selling alpaca socks, why wouldn't you want to bring in as many customers as you can?
There is also a chance that the Amazon exchange quickly would become the most popular exchange. So they would make money on the fees, and as long as it is easy to get Amacoin for other cryptos, I don't see why any bitcoin user wouldn't get some or use some...


If a merchant already takes bitcoin it almost takes no extra effort to take any other cryptos...


In this thread I explained several times the advantage of having your own crypto. The tendency would be more like everyone creating their own cryptos, just like their own giftcards...


No, they didn't take sides they just talked about Bitcoin because that is the most well known. But whatever ruling applies to BTC that also applies to any crypto, including Amacoin.

In the  I had a sell wall thus I made money by cashing out in a rally. Read it again or refer to the correct part.


It could but it can also turn around when others seeing that some big whale is buying. mass psychology... Walls also create a much deeper order book.


No, my whole thread is explaining that they would be making MORE. If the Winklewii sold over $1000 everything and buying it back now, do they have a loss or a profit???
Now if the whale is eventually wrong and price goes down forever, they can lose big, but if that happens they will lose anyway.My way they would lose less. And they believe that they are right, so why aren't they acting on their beliefs???
Bottomline is, price stabilization is a low risk, high return activity for a whale...

If Amacoin is already worth $20 by the end of year, why would it matter if you can spend it for $5 on Amazon? And no, it wouldn't be 1 billion loss, because:
1. Not every coin will be used.
2. The unused coins sell for $5 thus no loss.
3. Later on if price take off they can sell left over coins for profit...
4. It is their strategy but if price is in an upward spiral and people are using it for purchases, they don't have to cash out immediately and they can hold it and gain just by sitting on them...  Just like bitcoin in 2013...
@_date: 2014-02-17 15:19:40
That is your guess. My guess is that they will have a personal limit. Now they could screw my idea by saying, only old accounts have these limits, so if you just created an account for withdrawal, you can withdraw as much as you have put in. (but obviously new users won't be putting in coins)

@_date: 2014-02-16 03:05:37


OK let's see the 2 cases:
1. You have a sell wall and price breaks through it eating up all your coins. Where is your loss? Assuming you bought it at a much lower price, you just cashed out. Your only loss is the opportunity,  if the price never returns to that level and you have to buy in at a higher price. That is not necessery a loss, because every loss is determined by the selling price, not when you buy.
2. Price breaks through your buy wall and eating up all your available cash. Where is your loss? You own a bunch of cheap bitcoins, and you wanted to own them anyway. You only have a loss if price never returns to that level, but since you are a whale, you believe that even $1200 will be surpassed. So even if you had a buy wall at $1000 a few months ago, your belief is that you still have relative cheap coins. Temporary you probably have a gain, because you had a sell wall above the buy wall...

Hey, at least they didn't quote the price of $102 from a few days ago, and that wasn't even Gox...
@_date: 2014-05-02 18:57:10
1. You don't need a signifficantly better altcoin to take over bitcoin, you just need one with a bigger user base and more usability. just like Amacoin would be.
2. You don't need huge investments and infrastructure either, Litecoin was created by 1 man in 4 hours, slightly altering the bitcoin protocol. But anyway, Amazon does have huge infrastructure...
3. So you think 1% is optimistic? Why? They can use it as a giftcard, they don't need to be used as currency. And there is the investment feature, with very limited downside. I personally spend 100s on Amazon per year, I would buy 100 Amacoins in a heartbeat, if price goes up, pure profit, if price stays, I just spend it as I would spend dollars. I think 30% is realistic and there would be non-Amazon user users too, called investors...
3. Guaranteeing the price is basicly advertisement (or an investment), which could be written off as a loss, and Amazon is no stranger to losses. 
4. Amacoin is an altcoin, it can be used just like Bitcoin anywhere and everywhere. So Amazon sitting on Amacoins doesn't mean they can't buy stuff at Overstock with them... They can also pay programmers with them, again for a limited time it is a riskless investment.
Again, Amacoins are not worthless everywhere else, because most bitcoin vendors would quickly adapt them, for obvious reasons. Who wants to miss out on 30 million possible buyers?
I predict that if the US government comes out favorable towards cryptos (I don't expect this though), 2-3 years from now every major retailers will have its own alt coins. If that happens, bitcoin will go the way of Myspace...

1. Generating more purchases. What are coupons for?
2. You misunderstood, after 30 days the Amacoins are worth AT LEAST $5 or more.
3. So what? But I doubt, because lots of people don't get into mining because it is late in the process. With Amacoin they could get in with everyone else at the public mining start.
Also there wouldn't be a large holder of preminer, like with other coins. Well, Amazon could be, but it all depends on how many unused coins will be....

What you fail to notice that divisibility only work with value increase. If bitcoin stabilizes around $100 (or whatever) dividing it by a million is still a worthless piece of value. We don't divide the penny, although we could.
And this is where altcoins come in. There can be a situation where there is just not enough bitcoins practically available to make payments. Let's say I want to buy today something for 1 billion dollars worth of bitcoin. It is impossible to get that value in bitcoins...

It is a voucher only in the first 30 days, after that it is a fully functional digital currency. Why wouldn't a vendor already taking bitcoin would decide not to take Amacoins?
Tell me how many vendors accept Litecoin today? Very few. Still Litecoin is over $10... Amacoin would kill Litecoin on its very first day.

I am not saying they should make a coin, but they could. The Post office already has the necessary money transferring licences.
About divisibility: you can only divide units that has some worth. We could divide a penny into 100 pieces, but it is meaningless, because they are worthless. The same with satoshis. Most bitcoiners don't get this simple fact.

They are, you were just using the wrong stats. If you use:
you get a 400-600% increase on an annual base in the last 3 years. The difference is that this chart excludes popular addresses, and lots of volume was created by brokerages getting money in and out. Once you subtract those volumes, you will see the real volume increase, although I think it should be 10-15 times more on a yearly base...
So I agree, we should see more volume if BTC is being adopted more widely...

The point is, that it is up to them, not to the outsiders. How they ultimately decide to play the game, well, that is a question for the ages. They could have a no control approach and not to have a large reserve, but of course if price drops, customers will be unhappy. But customers do have to understand that they are holding a currency that fluctuates in price. 


The $5 guarantee can put a support at $5 and if they have the reserve, they can keep selling into rallies making the market not too overheated. 
but with anything involving humans, I would bet on the huge success and hedge funds getting involved, thus the price would take off...


Because this never happened to any of the altcoins???   :)
Why would they have an unlimited supply? Because people using Amacoin for purchases? How is that different from Overstock accepting bitcoin? Don't they have a continuous supply forever?


If they buy them for $6, that is the market price and they would be selling them for the same. If the current system doesn't hurt Overstock, then I don't see why Amacoin would hurt Amazon...
The guarantee is only for a year, and during that I expect Amacoin to raise. Now in the long run where it stops, who knows?

Because they had liquidity problems and they didn't want a run on the bank. As long as price went up, people were trading it and new comers brought in fresh money. When the price eventually fell Willy was selling, not buying. And there was logic in pushing the price down because their bitcoin to dollar liability was worth less. 
So at both times Willy was acting as the same interest as Gox's was. That is highly suspicious and indicates insider trading, not hacking.

I already described it in other answers, but the beauty of it that it doesn't have to be profitable. Amacoin itself is a huge advertisement for Amazon so they could write the loss (and there is a good chance they would make money) off in their accounting.
I would bet on the chance they could turn a handsome profit if Amacoin goes up, which it would... Tell me a reason why a hugely usable altcoin with the biggest userbase wouldn't be a hit?

@_date: 2014-01-30 11:45:08
What do you know about my position?
@_date: 2014-02-09 00:25:46
Let me clarify:
1. I don't care what kind of coin Amazon has right now, I am talking about the future.
2. I never said it wouldn't be decentralized. Just because it is promoted by Amazon, it still can be decentralized, Amazon just premines the most.
3. As long as Amazon guarantees at least $5 (starting/giveaway price) that is not their fault if the coin falls from 10 to 6. They just started it, the market is responsible for future evaluation.
  So here is how it would work:
1. They premine as many coin as their membership (let's say 30 million).
2. Then they release the protocol and everyone can mine, but they can too.
3. They give 1 coin for every member with a starting valuation of $5, and it can be used for any purchase on their website.
4. If the coin wasn't taken (to your wallet) or used after 3 months, it goes back to Amazon's wallet. The point is that they want you to acknowledge that the coin will be used.
5. They also open a market or make a well established firm to list it, like InteractiveBrokers.
How would it kill any coin? Well, as a start it immediately has a $5 value, and a possible 30 million userbase. It also has a reliable brokerage. That's all what any digital currency need. And initial distribution is very wide, nopne is having 1 million coins for themselves.... The cost would be 150 million dollars for Amazon, which is small change to a company that hasn't made any money in 16 years, and most likely losing money on the Prime membership.
  But if the coin takes off, they can take advantage of its features and the no CC fees, it also promotes Amazon itself...  It is a win-win for them....
Maybe I should contact Amazon with the idea...
@_date: 2014-05-26 11:11:25
If it is irrelevant (and I agree that it shouldn't move the price now) then why are you crying?
But it is not irrelevant from the perspective that the ATH was achieved by cheating and there was not enough real demand to support that $1200 price. Thus we have the 400-550 range now for weeks.
The bottomline is, that bitcoin would have gone up much slower without manipulation.

Once price fell below the other exchanges, the arbing opportunity was still there, just the other way around. The bottomline is, unless he is a complete idiot, he could have made up the loss by arbing.
The only way he couldn't if he was so greedy that he decided that fuck the customers and whatever money he made by the arbitrage that is his and doesn't belong to the customers (what is technically true).
So he could let the whole ship go down and still have 250K-300K coins now. Of course he will personally be sued, but the corporation might protect his personal wealth...

1. In a way you are right. But if bitcoin stays an investment vehicle, it has failed as a currency. Then let's not pretend this isn't a ponzi.
2. My point was here that when bitcoin has been fairly stable for weeks, months, WS's involvement can take it down. So just one more effect what we have to count on.

1. Amacoin has all the advantages of bitcoin, so if you like bitcoin, why wouldn't you use Amacoin? But Amazon would accept Amacoin but not Bitcoin.  Maybe later on once they killed it...   What is the biggest hurdle right now for mass adoption? Not being able to use bitcoin at large retailers (Overstock isn't large)  You could use Amacoin anywhere where bitcoin is used, it isn't exclusive to Amazon.
2. Amazon isn't forbidden to keep hashing and the resources they have, they could keep mining coins if they choose so and they would be probably one of the biggest miners. It is up to them and security. The hashrate and everything else is predetermined, just like with bitcoin.
3. Regular people don't need to mine. With every new coins there are always miner, because of the "what if it is the next big thing"? effect. With Amazon backing the issue, you bet there will be plenty of miners and investors too...

Well, not really. First, I wanted him to distribute them 2 years ago, so BTC would be that much ahead in the game. Second, it is still 8-9% of all coins, which is a pretty big difference and could effect both marketprice and acceptance.


Theoretically if there was only BTC, yes, but people always forget about altcoins. They will make or break virtual currencies, not BTC alone. That's why saying "only 21 million coins" is not factual, because some of the altcoins do the same, thus we have to count for their numbers too.

Nope. They have control of their own coins and their own miners. They get coins from purchases. They can cash them out right away like bitcoin vendors do, or they can keep it for investing purposes.


They are interested in Amacoin succeeding, so why would they screw their own child?


neither with Amacoin. It took 4 hours for 1 programmer to make Litecoin, so you can figure out how hard it is to make an altcoin. Marketing?  Mass email to every user explaining the set up, that is it.


  I agree that they would want to controll it, but no more as a large bitcoin holder wants to controll the value of bitcoin. If I am Amazon, I would want a rather stable and predictable slow raise (by slow 100%-200% per year), that brings in confidence, users and investors.

Except Craigslist doesn't make money from listings except employee and housing, I think. SR profited from the listings.
Also it is like the madam who runs the brothel is not breaking the law, she is just providing housing, and it is the prostitute and the client who are the criminals. Profitmaking what makes the huge difference morally, and criminally, the hosting itself.
Another example is the getaway driver in a bank robbery. He only provides transportation (according to your logic) he didn't rob the bank, hell he didn't even go inside.
Fun fact: SR hosted weapons initially but they discontinued it not for moral reasons but because it wasn't profitable. RU also sold drugs himself (mushrooms) beside hosting. Oh yeah, the murder for hire I am not even mentioning it....

Yet societies still exist. Also the logic of "it doesn't have to end that way" also applies to history.
More even distribution would be smart and more fair, evening the playing field. Nobody would hold 1 million coins from the start.
Yeah it becomes deflationary after the first 100+ years. Care to wait for that long?
Winklewii might be a joke but they hold 1% of all coins and their actions will effect the price. If the ETF goes through bitcoin will be MORE volatile.
Trading and hoarding is OK when you have enough coins/money. But with a small float stock like bitcoin it effects the price too much.
It is easy to ban, they only have to ban retailers. Then you can buy alpaka socks from Peru or your friend's baseball cards.
It doesn't help us that other currencies might be just as volatile.

No, it can effect both ways, up too. Since the Winklewii has to match the invested ETF money with bitcoin, depending on what investors do, the BTC price would follow. 
In short it would just make BTC's price more volatile....
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:22:26
No, when they invest, the Winklewii have to buy, so that would push the price up. That could be good for bitcoin, but the problem is that they can sell for a lots of more, unrelated reasons to bitcoin, because they need the cash, tax, whatever.
So bitcoin itself will be more fragile because now even oilprices can effect its price and not just a hacked exchange. And as we know big money effects the price a lot in both directions, so once hedge funds with their billions can start to invest indirectly (using the ETF) in bitcoin, that will start to yo-yo the price like never before...
A meltdown in the markets would also drop bitcoin's price, so it wouldn't be a safe heaven against the dollar....

Using a completely ridiculous defense?

That sounds logical, but they can also hope in price increase, so they can keep mining and just storing coins.At least the ones with their hardware investment already returned...

You asking me how the government does this or that? By enacting NEW laws. The new law simply says it is illegal to accept cryptos for payment. End of story and retailers using BTC.
If you are asking what the justification is for the new law, it can be anything. Once they connect bitcoin with terrorism, all gloves are off...
Or they simply declared BTC a competing currency to the dollar and making such is already illegal...
Look up e-gold and what happened to it...

Bitcoin kept its momentum. LTC had a bigger runup %-wise. If there are better programmed alts, we should switch to them, after all we are striving for perfection...

Sure it exists but:
1. It is almost never used.
2. Judges hate it and never inform jury members of it or how to use it.
3. Judges even block knowing jury members to inform other members of the jury of it.
@_date: 2015-01-11 20:02:22


Really? LTC at 3 years has more users than Bitcoin had at 3. Why is their infrastructures any different?
@_date: 2015-01-11 12:18:11


That is how the public looks at bitcoin.  :)
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:24:12
Actually at this point even smaller amount like 100K can be a problem. So you can't even pay for a house with bitcoin without getting screwed by price movement. And again, bitcoin is heralded as the perfect money. Well I want to be able to pay for big purchases with a perfect currency...
@_date: 2015-01-08 20:25:27
It could be prosecution tactic, what you don't understand. If he gets let's say 10 years for just running SR, the prosecutor is happy. If he gets off of it somehow, they STILL can charge him with murder for hire. Completely different charge. Not to mention they still can keep him locked up while the proceedings go on and on.
So it is basicly a 2 punch attack, they are just putting the 2nd punch in reserve in case he doesn't go down from the first hit.
As a minimum if he beats both charges he still can be in jail for 2-3 years while the whole court cases play out.
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:22:39
How about Bitcoin is like Facebook? Yet after 6 years, FB is everywhere and everyone is using it and its value has been on a constant growth?

I will answer it instead of him. I say about 5 features, what is going for bitcoin. Most people don't know but it could be used for elections for example. That is a very useful feature. But the rest of the 50 could be argued against very easily...
(It isn't unique, it isn't anti-inflatory, it is not a good store of value, etc.)

Bitcoin has a what, 7% inflation right now?
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:38:39
We don't know how they will behave, but there will be losses. Also if a big investor is losing money in other investment, he might have to cash out of bitcoin, just to have cash on hand. So everything will be even more interconnected.
In short, a Bitcoin ETF isn't good for a small unit currency...
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:57:50
Well, I would say 95% of people getting involved with bitcoin lost money, be it mining or trading or holding. Not counting people who actually used it for purchases. If I am right, that is an incredibly bad start for a new invention, high price or not. You can't take the greedy gambler out of humans...
@_date: 2015-01-06 17:51:26
Good thinking. But just by wildly fluctuating the price using rather small amount of money (let's say 10 million bucks) they could make investors and users weary. Eventually they would give it up.

They are not making even half of that...  There is cost in this business too.
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:36:04
Well, that is not how money works. There is a demand and supply to money creation. It is OK for a government to print money when the demand is growing. The 51% problem, the original distribution (uneven).etc.
For a list of the dangers, read the Winklewii SEC filing.
 Also, it is inflationary, not deflationary. Then there are the human challenges, the trading and hoarding instead of using it. Too much volatility, easy to ban,etc....
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:31:23
You are dumb. First you said it was sweet that your effort only worked 50% of the time then you say you will keep tipping.

@_date: 2015-01-10 13:07:29


You didn't include cost. You calculated pure profits based on probably high volume right after they reopened. It is quite possible the normal volume would give you 6 months, but when we throw in cost (not to mention eventually they might have to pay back the VC too) so this hiccup could have taken out a year's pure profit.
In the long run of course it is worthy for them to make everyone even, but what is most likely that as long as not 86% of their customers withdraw, they can just use the customers' money to pay the withdrawal. AKA frictional banking....

No. It lists a bunch of dangers what a bitcoin ETF investor can face. It is quite a long list...
The problem is, since the ETF would be connected to bitcoin, it would also effect the price...

You misspelled gambling.
@_date: 2015-01-31 18:13:56
Moving it once is not a big deal, after all mining it and moving it to a safe wallet is at least 1 move. But how many coins moved at least 3 times?
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:50:22


This could be avoided with better early distribution and a centralized (trustworthy) exchange...
Oh, did I say centralized???
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:52:03
Sure, and who cares what the media count is? But dropping 80-80% its value is short of dying each time...
@_date: 2015-01-04 05:23:21
That is an assumption...
@_date: 2015-01-09 01:27:58
Most jury members never heard of it and it is almost never used.
@_date: 2015-01-01 16:11:57

@_date: 2015-01-14 16:33:30
It also happens the opposite way. A small enthusiast cashes out of his 3 coins, but a big investor can keep averaging down and buying up cheap coins. So the ownership gets more concentrated....

So they climed up the ladder and then the blonde threw it down.
The next morning, the cops said, "Come out with your hands in the air!"
The red-head said, "Hide in those baskets, they'll never find us!"
So the Brunette got in the first one, the red-head got in the second one and the blonde got in the third one. Meanwhile, the cops were getting a ladder set up and trying to get up there. Once they got up, the seargent ordered them to kick the baskets.
So the cop kicked the first one: "RUFF."
"It's just a damn dog!" yelled the cop.
The cop kicked the next one: "MEOW."
"It's just a damn cat," yelled the cop.

Even accounting for fees, if BTC goes up 25% you bet the 5 futures owner doubled his money. That is what leverage is for.
@_date: 2015-08-20 12:30:22


As compared to watching the price of BTC fluctuating and worrying about it? At least I have fun...


Ask the egold guys about it...
It sure has been done, but we can't really say that it has lasted yet. The usefulness/legality history of bitcoin is really only 3 years or so...Practically speaking the governments could outlaw it in any day...


I agree, even the present of money is digital, since 90+% of the dollar only exists in computers...


So maybe bitcoiners should be working on those problems first and worry about the price later...
How long bitcoin will stay in the "very early days"? Or in beta?


It is excellent entertainment and an interesting social and economic experience. I enjoy it very much...
@_date: 2015-08-22 22:58:34


See the problems listed in this thread, I would like a bitcoin addressing those. Well, we should probably just start from scratch at this point...
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:32:44
Sure. But that happens now too, when active traders make less than hodlers. But if one just wants to hold, still better return with futures.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:02:49
Options expire, time works against them. Futures expire too, but there is no time value in them.  So if you have 10K dollars you can own 1 BTC or 5 bitcoin futures. If you are in it to make money, you are better off owning futures.

Rather ask: Why this altcoin is such a stupid idea? Now you see, what I see. The idea that everyone can just make money (and the authorities will allow it) and that money will be both accepted and have some kind of value without any backing is just plain socio-economic stupidity...

1. Why do I care if they invested in obsolate technology?
2. If they see the possibility for faster growth (and value jump) they will switch quickly.


What do you say about this criticism?:
"The bit Coin network cannot scale in any meaningful way. The Transactions per second is fixed at the protocol level, and you can't just add capacity to accept more transactions. Each miner in the network could half their output, and the system would see very little change "
@_date: 2015-08-20 22:45:07


Well, then it is easy not to care about the price. Had you bought in at $800, that would be a different picture, I assume.  :)


Any and/or all... If US, EU and China ban it, hey, you can still use it in India, I guess...


I never understand why coiners can't see this happening. All they have to do is make it illegal for businesses, very easy to do, and then you can only use it for peer to peer, and if it is stolen you can't even call the police...


Why? Shouldn't it be at least 1.0 v? How can Wall Street take it seriously if it isn't even out of beta???


But seriously, there are already better coins in existence. Hell even XT is better...

who smiles at people learning from their own mistakes. The general idea of bitcoin is so stupid, that people deserve a painful learning experience.


Thous shall not make a competing currency to the almighty dollar. It is actually illegal in the States. Also look what happened to Saddam when he switched from petrodollars to euros.


Only if you don't care about the LAW of the land. Look what happened to e-gold.


So shouldn't it be in a lab or something instead of millions playing with it?


At the moment is the keyword. It is rather easy to start a new coin, and some of the new ones have better features...
But how about this one: Instead of trying to get a concensus among the users, a dedicated group of people could just make a brand new fully improved coin and if its features are so much better than bitcoin's users should switch to that, according to the laws of capitalism. I mean if value is derived from usefulness and not from rarity or legend...

I hear you, except there aren't enough coins. Now Mark might decide to distribute all of them, but he doesn't have to.
Let's say you have a broker account at Ameritrade and you own Netflix shares. Then it is supposed to be stolen. Few years later they find it and NFLX went up. But the broker (and the government) will give you the value at the time of the theft. Why? Because what if they never found the stocks? What if the value dropped to half in the missing years? Would you want the current value then? Sure not...
And that is a perfectly logical reasoning. The only reason customers want the current value because it went up.
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:48:30
it does
@_date: 2018-03-17 23:10:13

Why would a Japanese offical care about your investment dreams? Or for that matter, how much they get for it when they had plenty.
Also, it is a free market so don't cry when a whale decides to cash out. Put your money that is less volatile and its market is deeper. With all these people holding of course a few thousands coins might effect a thin market...
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:24:34
Kind of BS article. There is no way they made that much.  Assuming they mined half of the coins and sold with an average price of 8000$,  900 x 365 x 8000=2.6 billions and not counting for cost.
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:57:28
They don't have them all. Would you mind getting 1/3 of your gold bar back? Or would you want the full value? 
Of course you guys want it both ways. If value drops, you want the original value. If value increases, you want the commodity. You can't have it both ways, that is why you get the value at the time of the crime.
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:48:57
Sure and if BTC was worth $50 today, you would still want the coins, not the 2014 value back, right?

Yes, on Reddit. By Japanese law any reimbursement has to be done in yen. It is the law of the land where the case belongs.

I did it on other forum. Now where the exact top would be, if at 18K or 22K yes, that is close to impossible but after the price went vertical the writing was on the charts.
@_date: 2018-03-07 12:06:54
They get it back in yen, instead of in BTC. Using the 2014 evaluation of Bitcoin. So in cash they won't have a loss, but they missed out on the rally.

Actually, governments do. Until they OK it, no real big money will invest in cryptos...
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:37:40


I saw it. Price chart going vertical corrects vertically. 50% is usually a minimum pullback from the top, but 62% or 75% can be in the works too.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:39:52
I think anything over 16K was just whipping creme on the cake. If you sold over that you still did good.
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:43:24
I would say, 90% of bitcoin is hoarded. Let's assume I am right. Because a few whales can hold lots of bitcoins, that doesn't mean only about 10% of users using it as a currency.  So they are definitely 2 different questions.
@_date: 2018-03-07 14:17:10
Legally they don't have to give back anything extra over the then value of $470 or whatever. Now Mark could distribute more, let's say half of the remaining BTCs as a goodwill and he would still stay a 100 millionaire, but he doesn't have to.
If I were him I would probably do that so every customer would have a 100-200% return, what is way less what BTC did, but way more than any other investment would have done. If some customers sue him later on, they have less of a standing when they have a multiplied account value.
Hell he could pay them back 4 times their 2014 value and still have 40K BTCs left over...
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:55:05
Bitcoin was first, that is the only thing going for it. Litecoin was way more flexible, more scalable, yet it doesn't have the same valuation. Saying cryptos are limited is missleading by the way, when one crypto can do just the same as the other, thus they are unlimited...
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:14:42
If there is a diamond heist where 10 million worth of diamond was stolen, do we say 4 years later it was a 50 million heist, if diamond's value goes up?
Ask yourself, if BTC was $50 today, would you want the coins or the account value in 2014? Sure you couldn't care for the coins if you have to take a 88% haircut...


So suddenly you want regulations and law? I thought crypto fans want freedom and no government interaction?
Also what if at the time of closure your account was in cash and not in BTC? After all it was a trading site and people were trading in and out of BTC.
Most countries (not just Japan) would calculate the account value at the time of loss, and not the current value. Japanese law gives reimbursements only in yen, so you will get your 2014 account value in yen.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:43:46

I don't have a problem if he keeps a little % for himself, let's say 5 -10 millions bucks. It would be good life insurance for him to distribute the rest, if you get 400% back, you are less likely to be grumpy about it.  And let's face it half of the people trading bitcoins would lose their accounts anyway.  :)

They do just not in a flashy fashion. Any money going into LTC is not going to BTC, and so on.
But the point isn't how unsuccessful are altcoins but what they could be.
Name any product that is cheap to produce, not copyrighted, and it has a high value. No such a product (only temporary like beany babies), because it would be copied to death (down to zero or the price of production).
So why should anyone think that BTC is worth over $200 when we have altcoins. The point being it is not unique... Hey LTC is still around $4, now that is a more realistic value...
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:18:12

@_date: 2015-04-01 00:49:53
They were also making like 300-4K a month (or was it double of that?), so a 5 million hole should have been made up pretty quickly. Max a year... There was another exchange with a sizeable loss due the theft and they swallowed it, because in the long run they make way more...

The only real value in bitcoin is the blockchain. Economically speaking anyone just can't make up currencies and expect that they would last.
What makes you think that people wouldn't want to control and manipulate bitcoin? So far everything points to the contrary.
Imagine a bigger entity buying a shitload of BTCs on exchanges then dumping them back, then do it again 5-10 times. They don't even need much money for it. The roller coaster ride of a lifetime, and nicely destabilizes the currency...

It was probably in a 5% range of the then actual price what was like $650 (2014 March 5th) or so...
At the second auction he won 2000BTCs and the price was (2014 Dec 5th) around $370...
Since the price moved so much and assuming that it was close to the then current price, knowing the exact price isn't really that relevant, although interesting...

If it is so hard to fix bitcoin, why not just start a new one with much better features?  Is competition too much for bitcoin and its value?

You are talking about brands in a car talk. Nevertheless cars did take over from horses. Your analogy is simply wrong. We are not debating if Betamax or VHS is the better videotape standard, we are debating if we really need videotapes when we have CDs already...


That doesn't need to be. Let's say reddit makes a coin and every redditor gets one. Bumm!! From day one you have 60 million potential users. It is incredibly easy to distribute among millions of users, if one isn't greedy...

We should care just out of curiosity. We should care because it is our money. We should care just for the sake of careness. And just because there are other more important questions that doesn't automatically means we shouldn't care.
Not to mention your assumption could be wrong. Why would anyone pay above the current price when they could just buy it up slowly???

@_date: 2016-05-03 16:48:01


This is the nature of the beast. I think writing patterns, and speaking styles are more important proofs, than crypto evidence. Also the ability to code in C and a logical explanation of the last 7 years and the coins not moving. If Craig could all do that, I would take his word against any key singing evidence...
Moving the coins =/= 100% probability..

@_date: 2016-05-03 16:32:20
1. If they don't give a shit about the money, they should just donate and spreadt the coins, increasing the userbase.
2. As long as this whole chunk of bitcoins are just hanging there, there is a fear. So let's spend it or destroy it or whatever, and get over with it already.

Except the internet didn't have a competitor. The same way certain areas are only serviced by 1 ISP, they can set any price they wish.
There are 2 big dangers for ANY digital currency:
1. A much better competitor arising.
2. Outright government ban.
These facts are non debatable, you have to live with them.


That is not true. because of the consensus needed, sometimes it is easier to start from scratch with a new but better currency. Sure it needs to be accepted, but the technical implementation of improvements is easier with a new currency...

Alright, but bitcoin is also a commodity, thus a product. Better this way?


Not yet, but there could be. Also when  the price is going up, so goes the alts' prices, taking away investment money from bitcoin.
You can bet if BTC stayed above $1000 for months, the incentive for more alts and specially better alts would be even bigger. Right now demand for bitcoin is falling so does its price and the price of every altcoins...

And a supplement is usually a plant or a vitamin. same thing, you can feel free to build on it and use it for other things, the point still stands. You are not going to make millions out of it, because the market will jump on the idea.


Successful doesn't mean they can charge as much as they want for their product, right? Any of them charging $1200 per product? How about 100K?
If it is easy to copy, I am sure there are competitors bringing the product's price down. Analogy is still valid...

I could argue the opposite, over the past year BTC's price fell 60% partially because there are more cryptos than ever. It is not exactly true, but you agree that the existence of Litecoins took away some of bitcoins value and the investment money that was coming in.

Actually, there is. Read up on the story of Acai berries. Anyhow, long story short, very few people even knew about it until 2 brothers decided to market it for various ailments. Then acai fever came, price went up, brothers got good profits. Now scientific studies can't really prove acai does all the good things attributed to it, but who cares? Good PR and the network effect (aka flavor of the month) made it a success story, for a while.

Well I always look at the border with Mexico this way: if 20K Mexicans can cross it everyday, I am sure one American can cross it to the other direction.
He knew how to order fake IDs, already had them. Now assuming he actually planned the flight, he can ask friends for money and with bitcoin he can pay them back from anywhere.
But OK, let's play I am him in house arrest. I know the trial will last 2-3 weeks, so that is the timeframe I have to get ready. I assume he would have a "no internet" order, so I would ask a friend to bring a laptop and use someone's internet from the appartment (assuming I can access open wifi). From the net I can order fake IDs, for the time I am still in the States. If access to the net is problematic, I just need cash for 2 weeks and a place to stay. Here I need at least 1 good friend.
I would ask for donations for my trial before the run or if on the run already donations for my escape. Bitcoiners would be giving away their life savings just to help me.
Nowadays it is easy to get cash from bitcoin locally or using the ATMs, so I would do that and keep moving. Probably crossing the border to Mexico. Then he can get a passport for relative cheap and then he could travel wherever he wanted.
People did this before, as long as you keep it low tech and you don't fly, it can be done. Oh yes, a little disguise is also helpful... But anyway, we live in the age of Bitcoin, the perfect payment for a disappearing act!

Lots of questions so:
1. One of the 36 NFL teams.
2. Tesla and Amazon will drop in the long run. They are built on sand.
3. Yes, professional investing companies invest in bad businesses all the time. How many of them saw the housing bubble? The tech bubble?
4. I look at bitcoin objectively. I am not against it, neither I am a believer. Your approach is subjective.
Bitcoin is nothing more special than most of the altcoins. The only thing is the first mover's advantage (network) but as we saw from Myspace's example, that doesn't mean much nowadays.
Name just one invention What's price increased by more and more adoption! It never happened. Mass adoption LOWERS the price or it gives you more feature for the same price down the road.
Also name an invention that is unpatentable but easy to copy and its value stayed high! It doesn't exist. Once freemarket is introduced to such invention, the competition is increased (altcoins) and price plummets.
So yes, I do know history, business, psychology and basic math and I objectively see the problem of bitcoin, thus my prediction. I was right about the price last year, I will probably be right this time too....

Logistically it makes more sense just to kidnap someone who known to be owning BTCs. 3 reasons:
1. You can transfer the coins in minutes or the most in hours, as compared to days.
2. They are not very well protected fellows and easy to approach...
3. You can make sure there is no police involvement at least until the coin exchange.
Oh yeah one more reason:
4. The family can decide NOT to pay. The bitcoin whale is most likely can be persuaded to cough up at least some coins...

That is all nice, but you could still play the fluctuations. The $1200 was obviously an overheated market (I personally thought it would stop at $800) and this current $500 is also too high. So you could have sold every runup and bought back when the inevitable fall came...

As long as users switch, so will miners. And users can switch quickly. Let's say Amazon accepts Litecoin but not Bitcoin and gives you 5% discount that is an incentive to switch. If people start to use Litecoin more its price increases and more miners will mine it too.


I disagree. It went up because it was the flavor of the month, and investment fad. Not because its scarcity. After all the relative scarcity stayed, but the price collapsed...
@_date: 2015-02-18 04:30:51

Once they have quite a few, they accept it, the price skyrockets, they profit...

Well, first he has to have the cash if wants to buy in person, and it is hard to locate someone willing to sell that much. He obviously needs to open an account and wire that much money, so you tell me, at least a day? Then actually buying 44K coins if possible not interrupting the price much (good luck with that). And then withdraw the coins, some exchange have daily limits on withdrawals...
I am not sure what the max. numbers of coins using Coinbase, but I doubt you can just buy 44K coins very fast...
So I would say 2 days as a very minimum using an exchange????

Money and currencies are products. Hell, the US government runs a website called Themoneyfactory. look it up.
 Bitcoin is a lots of things, among them commodity and product. But anyhow call it inventions if you feel better...
Now your points:
1. Yes, very easy. Premined coins distributed over a large number of people. Like Reddit notes. Give those premined notes to each redditor, you have a 20 million possible userbase.
2. By productivity here we mean all cryptos, not just bitcoin. Once one crypto succeed, there will be others like mushroom. Oh but it already happened. Miners started to mine very productively pretty much everything, thus supply went to unlimited.


But we can increase the supply of cryptos and they are or can be all the same. So once you understand that there is nothing unique about bitcoin, you will get my argument...

"in his revelatory blog post he completely fails to do basic math. He miscounts the number of strings up to a given number of bits (and completely misuses the mathematical jargon), while the real Satoshi successfully executed standard statistics arguments in his white paper."

Now you are talking about aggregate value. You could have mentioned the road network too. But they are false analogies, because as such networks they are unique and hard to replace. There is nothing unique about bitcoin, it can be replaced in a few hours...
Not to mention both the internet and the road network had enormous costs, and somebody paid for it. Bitcoin (or altcoins) are relative cheap to compare, or at least they shouldn't be like today $150 or so to mine a coin....


Give them incentives and they would. But most merchants aren't keeping the coins, so bitcoin for them is just a payment method, not a currency...

@_date: 2015-02-18 00:20:26
Again, bitcoin is not like the internet. It is riding on the internet, using it. But building it out cost very little and can be done in no time, if you give enough incentive to people to use it (large distribution of coins among lots of people)
So the analogy doesn't work at all. And again, there is no product invention what has an increasing price with increasing adoption. usefulness, yes, can increase (like fax machines) but price will always drop....
You are using the internet's value/price as a whole like I would add up all the faxmachines value to make a point about them....
And coattail riders like Litecoin is an excellent example. The completely useless LTC reached $50 or so just because Bitcoin went gaga. But Litecoin also took away investment money from BTC, and if BTC's price would start to go to the Moon again, you bet all the altcoins would follow.
You can not have a nonpatentable (copyright protection) and easy to copy (cost of entry is cheap, unlike the internet or road networks) invention with a high price. Not in the freemarkets....
Anyway, you have been explained and warned, now go and lose your money....
@_date: 2015-02-18 04:00:39


You think so. If every redditor get a reddit notes tomorrow and Amazon accepts it, that would give us a possible 20 million users in the largest retailer of the world. Then bitcoin's little 1 million or so users will switch so fast you can't even blink.

Nobody in their right mind would stick around in a trial like this, not to mention the still possibly upcoming murder for hire trial.
He made a big mistake not moving to abroad once he was blackmailed (somebody knew his identity). He most likely wouldn't do the same mistake by waiting for the verdict with an ankle bracelet.

AS an experiment 2 weeks ago I virtually (on paper, not in real life) shorted BTC and went long LTC. BTC went up from 47 to 170, LTC went up from 26 penny to 3.8$. (the peak was 5.4$)

I don't think the analogy is a perfect one. The internet has speeded up information exchange. And it didn't have enemies, (maybe a few closed countries) like the state is an enemy of bitcoin.
Also it didn't have competition, the darknet, and local company networks and such aren't competitors to the internet. 
  Bitcoin doesn't solve lots of problems of fiat money and creates new ones, not to mention the possible competitors and enemies. In short, the analogy to the internet is invalid....

@_date: 2013-05-07 16:13:41
Just one of those days. To answer your question, when a stock is very illiquid, it is easy to move it in either direction. In the case of BTC I am guessing even with 100K-200K (or worth of coins) one can keep pushing it up and down.
So if you have 200K on the exchange, just keep buying, and when  you run out of money, start to sell and keep selling until you run out of coins. 
Rinse and repeat...

@_date: 2013-04-26 15:25:59
Well, when it went over 140, specially 150 I was expecting a bigger pullback, so this 10 bucks here and there can not be used automatically anywhere. Bigger the runup, bigger the pullback, generally speaking.
   I still expect the price go back to the 160-180 range, so in your scenario, you just have to wait it out or buy even more when falling.
Of course this plan can backfire if the price never goes back, but we won't plan on that, right?
@_date: 2013-11-15 01:42:52

Not in the beginning. Satoshi mined 1.1 million coins for himself before the other miners came in. So I don't see the difference. Trust? Most people still don't trust bitcoins, so a company would actually have an easier start as trust go, because people already know about it something...

Divisibility is only meaningful if the value rises. The point of expressing the smallest value is still to have a practical use of that value. If it is nearly worthless, there is no point in expressing it. Just like we don't talk or use 1/100 of a penny, there is no point in talking/using 0.0000001 (or whatever small you want) BTC. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:57:26

Not everyone is like you. They might be assholes, but they are rich assholes.
Also, in a shallow and illiquid market huge coin buys and dumps are not illegal manipulation, the price's movement is simply the effect of the shallowness and illiquidity.
  So let's say I have 100K coins I bought slowly, then I dump it on the market, the price falls. It is called capitalism, I had the right to sell my coins at any manner I wanted. Now the price is low, I am rich, I will start buying again. Rinse and repeat...
@_date: 2013-05-05 20:36:27
1. I did have a specific idea, mine all the coins first and distribute them fairly equally among a large userbase, like reddit.
If you don't know who mined those coins, you don't know what their plans are. What if they use them to bring an end to bitcoin? Dumping them in 100K-100K chunks on the market bitcoin could easily go down to single digits...  Then you can ask the average user's trust in the currency...
  Also, bitcoin hasn't worked yet. When large retailers accept it and the value don't fluctuate more than 5 % on a weekly base, you can say it has worked....

Correct. Although 1 year is still a long time. Let's say the price stabilizes between 200-250$, for the whole year, that is still 25% fluctuation. I really don't see it stabilizing that way that the annual fluctuation would be under let's say 5-8%...

I agree with the OP completely. Venture capitalists are already realizing, what, we can actually just create our own currency? Well, why don't we just do that? They are working on it. And the most important thing what BTC fans don't get, that the eventually most popular coin doesn't have to be technically the best. Remember the video industry? Beta max was superior to VHS and lost.
  So what would make the average people to switch? How about catching a ride at the early stages? If a new coin just costs 5-10 cents right now, I can throw a hundred bucks at it like lottery tickets. Most people now know the bitcoin example that it could reach the valuation of 100s bucks and making you quite a lots of money, assuming you catch it at the early stage...
When I became aware of LTC about 6 weeks ago it was worth a quarter. It peaked over $5,  4 weeks later a 20 times return, while BTC only appreciated 5 times or so. 
So there will be (there already are) competition we can count on it. Which one is going to be the final winner? Who knows? Being the early leader can backfire if anyone remembers Napster and Megaupload. Right now I like LTC better and I will check out ppcoin too...

-no real unique (meaning uncopiable) intrinsic value
-depends on people's acceptance,hype
-competition will be big
-governments can outlaw it in no time
-it is an investment not a currency right now, and as long as the price increases, it will stay as such.Once the price keeps dropping, the end of the story, a new coin will raise...
-constant deflation not good for a currency

After 24 or so hours, the price did go below 125, so I bought more. Now the price is around 132, so I am up 7 bucks with the second and down 3 bucks with the first entry.
To avoid a big crash on a full position, I will sell the second buy in at profit and keep the original entry of 135 running. If price dips below 125, I buy in again....

Yes and no. If bitcoin wants to be real money and not a pennystock, it needs to be spent. What if 99% of it will be hoarded? Is that a goal? Would that be good?

Eventually it will collapse to 5 penny or so, but people still will keep buying and trading it because they remember the good old days when some morons paid $266 for it and they hope that it would happen again. There might be some runups to smaller highs like $1 but the earlier fame and success will never return...

I am not sure, but I think we could figure out something.


  Of course it does. Just think of it as voting power with stocks. The more stocks you have, the more power you hold inside the company. If the coins are very concentrated and withheld from circulation, things happen like today, the market stay illiquid...

You guys are so naive that it is ridiculous. Why any retailers would accept bitcoin? For some kind of advantage. If the customer wouldn't buy the product in any other way, they may accept it, IF (and it is a big if) it is convenient. 
Just like CCs. They are a pain for retailers, but not everyone has cash, but they don't mind to purchase on credit. So if the seller wants to sell the product, they have to accept credit cards even if it is a bit pain and costs them.
Bitcoin is neither convenient (actually dangerous because of the volatility) nor necessary (you still buy the product without bitcoin)
In short, petition is stupid...
If I were a retailer, the only way I would take bitcoins if I charged at least 5$ over the exchange rate and I immediately sell them for dollars. But that would screw you, the customer, because you would be paying 5-7% extra...

Here is a way to cash out some safely:
1. Start to donate random but big amounts to charities, people, groups.
2. Once hundreds of others have the early coins, he can start to sell them, because he can just claim he was one of those who got it as a donation.
3. As an added advantage, those coins would get back into circulation, helping the currency status of BTC.

Yes it does. A currency needs to be used, and not hoarded. When you have 1 million users with small amounts it is more likely that they will use the money than a few big hoarders. The way how Bitcoin was distributed set up the failure later on...


An early adopter just had to set up a computer and let it run and he could became a big hoarder. When everyone gets 1 coin, you need a lots of begging or buying to get to own the same amount of coins...

@_date: 2013-04-08 04:14:45


  You didn't get the analogy. Owning 1 million BTC right now is 9% of the coin supply. That is huge in one hand...
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:14:38
You are completely wrong and most bitcoiners don't get this problem. bitcoin isn't scarce, it is actually unlimited supply...


That is what exactly it means. The only problem is value. When the value is rather small, there is no point in dividing it into small pieces, because something worth less then a cent is pretty much worthless. But as price increases, the smaller pieces get to be usable.
Consider this with the dollar. let's say for easy math there are only 1 trillion dollars in usage. Thus if we think 1 cent as the unit of dollar, there are only 1 trillion times 100 units available. With bitcoin this number is infinite, we can create as small units as we want, just the smallest unit will be 1 satoshi or 1 milli satoshi or even 1 micro satoshi.
The other way of seeing this is market cap. As long as no more dollars is printed, the dollar's market cap isn't increasing. But bitcoins market cap (and usable units) has been increasing constantly...
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:24:40
The way how fast it bounced back from under $500 shows that there is pleny of buying power sitting 2-300 bucks below and people are waiting for cheaper coins to participate. So at least for the short term, I think this 7-800 price range is pretty safe from a crash. It might need a few days of consolidation (and more dollars arriving at brokerages) before it goes higher.
That is my take and I am somewhat experienced with trading...
@_date: 2013-05-07 20:01:30
I thought I can practice daytrading BTC on it, but its price had nothing to do with the real price of BTC, not even close.
Second, you guys have to realize that this is a bucketshop and no connection to any exchange whatsoever. You are playing against the website's owner, so good luck if you are really good at winning.  Also, I am not sure about shorting, theoretically it sounds good, but in real life when BTC tanks, I am not sure they will give you a chance to short it....
@_date: 2013-04-09 10:43:16
Wouldn't that be the whole point of using BTC? If we express the price in US dollars all the time, what's the point?
@_date: 2013-04-14 12:39:34
Let's say 10 years from now BTC is around $200. A satoshi is still worthless. There are 16 million coins created (or whatever) but because of the good investment nature, 15 million of it is horded and not in circulation. So 1 million coins worth only $200 each could handle the online economy? It can't even today not 10 years from now when it is way more mainstream...
  And there is no point in dividing down to a bunch of worthless units....
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:18:46
Actually, no. If bitcoin is a currency, limited usage gives it less value...
@_date: 2013-11-29 12:00:09

I agree with your idea but my solution was to introduce the whole supply all at once to the largest possible user base. Like Reddit. I have a thread where I advocated to give every Redditor a Redcoin, (that would mean at least 10 million possible users right away) and to avoid losing lots of coins to unused accounts, after a certain period, unused coins would be withdrawn.
  Because of the divisibility of the coins there is really no need to issue more later on...

Very cool article. If Satoshi is a government team, everything they mined happens to be government property, thus they can not sell for personal gain.

Completely agree. That was my idea too. The original distribution of bitcoins was ridiculous and a few early birds got all the worms. Even if it is an improved new coin not from a big company, it still should be distributed the widest possible way. Just imagine, every Redditor gets a coin, 11-15 million coins distributed right away. And nobody is sitting on a 100K wallet...

They can regulate it, enforcing it is another matter. For regulation, they can cite terrorist or criminal activities as reasons.

Good point about the legality. Note to Mark: talk to DoJ first.


Not true. If they ban it in the US, any merchant accepting it could be prosecuted. And a few thousand individuals who spend it on obscure websites doesn't count. They can make it hard to use exchanges too.
Once the USA and the EU are out, good luck using it in China...  I guess it could become a 3rd world currency...

Not exactly true, it is valued by hype too. You tell me why in 3-4 days time the valuation changes 80% down or 300% up. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 16:08:17
Not always. If large % of the coins is hoarded, it takes much less volume to move the price at MTGox either way. Similar when most stock is held by the board members, but they usually squiz the shorters. With bitcoin unloading a mid-sized position can have the effect what we are seeing...
@_date: 2013-11-03 21:31:53
Correct. My guess is that it won't reach low volatility (needed for accepted currency status) until it crashes big and the investor money is withdrawn and only people who actually use it have it. That might be under $20. The problem is that people will remember how high it has been and keep buying it when it is down, so a steady valuation might be still years away...  I can only see it if the US government comes out and declare it at least quasi legal, but I don't expect them to do so...
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:21:25
They have to charge for trades real amounts, so the bot traders would get hurt. The equivalent of $1.5 per trade. And yes there has to be a minimum amount of coins to be traded, possibly 0.1
@_date: 2013-05-06 01:42:59
It is irrelevant if it is reddit or facebook users, or Metallica fans, the point is, that when you introduce a new currency, you want it widely used and get popular fast. Having a few dozen people mining it is neither. You give it out freely to a large amount of people and some will use it most of them probably not. But still the starting userbase will be 3 magnitude or more higher than it was in the case of Bitcoin...
If you give them some other value (let's say on reddit if you give it someone it is like reddir gold) then it has immediate value, although not necessary monetary value. But users will appreciate it. If they don't want it they could tip other or just freely give it away....
  And honestly financially there is no point in mining. The coins could be introduced all at once. I know the mining validates the blockchain, but financially/economically speaking, there is no point in the slow introduction...

That is also a good idea. The point is that the coins need to be circulated, not hoarded. They could have started a real, trusted, functional exchange for example, so the valuation of coins would be more smooth...

Not bitcoins, but the idea. A competing currency can devalue your currency. Look up why the US didn't like Saddam switching to Euros as payment for oil. Litecoin and others already exist.
There is no way for bitcoin to stay the only one, they only have the first mover's advantage, but that can be taken away...
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:18:42
Actually, they can keep selling. As long as they still hold something, they are still making more and more. And nobody knows where it will peak, so it makes prudent investing strategy to keep cashing out...

You have $100 profit from 1 coin from the first transaction. It is irrelevant that you reinvested it, as long as overall you are still in profit with your trading activities. And I would argue (based on the FIFO logic First In First Out) that you made 38$ on the second coin and 34.5-34.5 on the last 2 coins. (138-103.5)
So your profit so far is 100+ 38+ 69= 207$  according to my count but I am not an accountant...

I think you over estimate HFs. First, most HFs loses money over the long run, so they are hardly that smart. Second, they have lots of money, so for some, throwing 50-100 million on BTCs would be only 1-2% of their amount under management.Third, there are lot of them. Ten thousand. So if just 1/100th of them gets interested, that is still 100 HFs investing in bitcoins.
And don't even get me started about their strategies, some of them are really ridiculous...

That is not how it works. First they don't always mirror each other, I know because a month ago when BTC went up 300%, LTC was up 5-700%.
  Second, when you say BTC is limited amount you forget LTC and the other coins that provide just the saem benefits, so the finite amount just got bigger by at least 4 times.
Third, in the future there can be and will be a development when one stops to be popular, even banned and the other survives. Napster comes to my mind....

For couple of reasons:
--as an experiment how people react to the idea of virtual money (the government might want to introduce this at a later time)
--assuming certain weaknesses, to locate criminals/terrorists
--to found their own agents in other countries
--after egold they might thought someone is going to try it, so why not them, thus they have the advantage of controlling the experience (via coindump, if necessary)
--if they manage eventually to discredit the idea (lots of people getting burnt), that would cause backlash to the notion of virtual money maybe for decades

First, there are still visionaries, only the implementation is different. It is easier, and more democratic. You have to realize that no matter what, there will be early adopters, but at least my idea widens the group and makes early hording much harder.

Nope and nope. At almost every Ponzi-like new invention it is a paradigm shift and this time it is difference. I don't see what is so special about either Google or Amazon. Actually, Amazon took forever to make money and they are reinvesting a huge amount into storages what is to me silly, when the real seller could just send it from their warehouses. Amazon is only the middle man with a server, they don't need to hold the product in expensive warehouses....

Inherent value in this regard is what you could use it for instead of the its US dollar value. let's say if you trade stamps, you could always use them for their nominal value and send packages. A gold bar can be used for lots of things, from jewelry to parts in technological things. Salt can be used as food suppliment, paper money as toilett paper. Those are the intrinsic values.

Stop living in fantasy land. If most merchants won't accept BTC due to government regulations, it doesn't matter how popular it is, you can only buy small shit with it, in a peer to peer way.
With any currency, acceptance is the most important thing. If acceptance is limited, there goes the value. Even without banning, if they can make a more successful coin they can make BTC obsolate.

The problem is complex, so you can't just look at number of coins without needs and evaluation to other currencies. Even if we don't look at the dollar price, we still have to count for demand. So although there are more coins today than in 2011, the demand is way higher, thus price went up...

Actually, the comparison is pretty good. Both products have intrinsic value. The fact that tea can be used only once doesn't change that.

What % is used for everyday purchases today? Nobody knows but I would say very little, so because of the high return phase, I would say we are already in the holding phase.
  I think one reason why more and more small businesses accept it because its value is increasing. So why wouldn't they sell products for it? But we don't know what they do with the gained coins, and it is quite possible that they keep holding most of it as long as the value keeps going up.
  But as a short answer, it is human psychology. If you get paid by a rare baseball card that can be worth 100% more in 2 months, would you cash it or hold into it?

Nope, and here is the approach. When you are using dollars, just because other speculative methods (gold, baseball cards, bitcoin) exist that doesn't mean you have to choose between them, it is not dollars vs. speculation.

When a parabolic bubble bursts, it usually falls back to at least 50%. So that is a decent prediction point. It also violently ups and downs until it smooths. So if you kept buying below $130 yesterday, you were rewarded eventually because price did came back to 140 later on.

OP does bring up a good point. Because  the exchanges are not connected and some of them have very low liquidity thus a big player could push the price either way. 
  So what is stopping them? Lack of imagination....
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:42:29
So you are advocating bitcoin for speculation. If I start to use BTC 10 years from now, why did I miss anything? Oh, because I didn't invest in it? Then bitcoin isn't a currency but a nice ponzi...
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:50:52
If the unit price goes up a lot, smaller units are usable, thus yes, there can be more than 21 million.   100 million times more...
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:34:00


  Who cares? I noted earlier there is no fully democratic system. But with my idea we would have 10 million possible users right away, with Bitcoin it is possible they still haven't reached that number after 4 years...
  And I don't care who is claiming what, when they are obviously wrong...
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:51:26


so is it forever or eventually?
The way how it is, price stability is not in the works. If price crashes, %-wise it will still be volatile because people will remember the $400 price and still buy it at $2, thinking that it will go back again. So a 2-2.20 price range is still very volatile for a currency...
@_date: 2013-10-24 21:35:28
Well, if I might add, intrinsic value also exists without other people. Bitcoins don't. You can eat salt alone, you can make jewelry out of gold alone. You can't use bitcoin alone....

You are arguing against the bitcoiners. They are bringing up the divisibility so that bitcoin could handle the needs of the economy. Now you are saying it can not be divided indefinitely (fine with me) but that also means if it catches on, there might be a shortage...

Not really. Wide distribution of a new currency and immediate usability can be just as good for adoption. If Reddit gives you a Redcoin, I bet you would adopt it, because you now know Bitcoin's example...

Well, he is right, this COULD happen. No need for new laws to ban BTC, just play it hard and rough...

My idea is to anticipate the selloff and put the orders in while it is still going up. Then lags are not a problem...
@_date: 2013-05-05 14:55:42
I agree, but even if he only has 500K, that is still lots of coins. Also, to me distributing the early but worthless coins would have made more sense, after all you are trying to get something off the ground, not getting rich. So the best way to popularize it is giving it away. A la Ripper....
@_date: 2013-11-24 12:12:17
Yeah, a hot dog selling licence costs like 250K in Manhattan...

@_date: 2013-05-05 15:29:34
My theory on the creators:
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:49:52
If you want scarcity, release only 1 million coins instead of 10. There is still no need for mining for that. There is no advantage of having scarcity first and going wide later...
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:16:54
We would have been happier with the DDoS explanation. Also, what happened at the other 5 exchanges? They have shitty servers too?

1. Most tradable things don't trade over the weekend. Last price is usually the Friday 4 or 4:15 pm price.
2. Even when they quote, just what exactly do they quote? There are always at least a $10 wide range of prices among the exchanges...
Bottomline: there is no point in quoting bitcoin right now....

He asked why, not how. The why is not clear at all. I could argue that there are enough coins right now and the continuous release of further coins is not needed.
And this is my other big criticism of BTC, there is really no point in the way how they keep releasing the coins. Monetary-wise we are talking about. A currency needs to adjust to the economy's needs, not automaticaly created like there is no tomorrow...

This is the problem with fans, they don't understand psychology. At the first crash years ago let's say 1000 coiners got hurt. This time it can be 1 million users, that is a magnitude of 3 bigger. And those people will tell to lots of others about their experience, and create negative publicity.


I was referring to the dollar amount invested.


Then let's have the growing pains at other people's expense and email me when the price is ready for prime time.  :)

Except you send money to the brokerage and they send money back to you, sounds like a transmit to me...
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:10:01
Because a 60% negative change in the price is hardly a correction. Or ask the BTC owners how they felt during the day? It was definitely a crash, but it bounced back.
Just because there was a huge runup beforehand, it is still a crash...   :)
@_date: 2013-04-22 00:57:19
Then why am I using bitcoin? What is the advantage?
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:51:22

Tell me what is the unit of bitcoin now? What will be the unit when 1 BTC is worth 1 million bucks?
I never said there will be no more dollars. I said, what if there is no more printed? You can not divided it to smaller pieces, unlike with Bitcoin. For bitcoin 1 microsatoshi can be a usable unit easily...
Here is another one: What is 22 million people wants to use the existing 11 million coins? Then the average owner can only have half a bitcoin? Would that be sufficient for a currency???
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:02:41
Good analyses. Of course interest followed the price. Once price collapsed, the interest faded away...
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:38:15
If Satoshi is actually a US government employee, doesn't he already get paid for his job? Why does he need a shitload of bitcoins too? If the early adopters were enthusiastic hobbyists, why do they need to be rewarded with millions? I mean if Bitcoin is a business, alright, award away, but let people know that it is a business and not a make the world a better place...
@_date: 2013-04-22 11:00:31
Very easy. Other coins get more popular but generally businesses do accept virtual money.(thus usage grow)
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:37:00
Disagreeing is your prerogative, but proving your side is better... LTC is already appreciating faster than BTC for the above reasons. Lots of people who missed the BTC mining boat are happily mining LTC...
@_date: 2013-04-08 04:06:23


Quite to the contrary, it is an incentive to hold out as long as possible or just until they think the price would collapse.
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:42:55
And the very big advantage of Litecoin has been that you STILL can be an early adopter....
@_date: 2013-04-30 13:29:29
OK, but I guess transactions happened 1 month ago or earlier have been verified already, so there is no point in verifying them again. That's why I thought that there should be a base ledger everything until a months ago and only the last 4 weeks or even less needs to be verified...(I guess that is a partial node resynch)
@_date: 2013-05-02 10:58:56
First, a government (or a strong guy) doesn't need to ask permissions or be moral. They can act whatever way they want.
Second, there are already 2 existing laws (no competing currency allowed and permit needed for money transfer business) that can be used against bitcoiners.
So it is really just how long can bitcoin fly under the radar. Oh wait, it is already above it...
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:22:10
That looks like a scam. There is no logical reason either to borrow or to lend BTC, because it appreciates so quickly:
1. For the lender, it is just easier to keep it without risk (of the borrower) they still make gazillion % return.
2. For the borrower the asked return rate would be prohibitive. They are not going to ask 20% annual rate when it goes up that much per week. So a decent rate would be like 400% and who wants to borrow at that rate???
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:41:13
Very good link, excellent explanation.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:01:02
The logic is good, except the volume is not taken into account. If there are buy orders for 300K coins, but I dump 400K coins on the market, it will still crash....
@_date: 2013-05-02 20:44:19
They could move the servers to a friendlier country, but I agree, the disruption would be tremendous...
@_date: 2013-07-06 15:40:52
They can only sell once. If they want to sell more times, they also have to BUY more times, so stop blaming them. Bitcoin will go to zero (alright under 1 buck) eventually....

Now I agree, some of those coins coud be loast, but even half million coin is sufficient to crash the market. In the 13th crask the volume was ony 40K....

By the way theymos, your enthusiasm is admirable, but as  good financial advice, sell most of your coins if we get in the 130-150 range again and you can buy them back under $50 in less than a year.
There is no reason to go down with the ship, and you still can have the same amount of coins, for much cheaper....

  There is no completely democratic system, that we have to accept. So you pretty much can pick any way where you can access a huge userbase. Basicly any random HUGE group of people is better than early miners who get the most.
  You see with a currency large chunks are not supposed to end up in a few hands. Satoshi could be sitting on 10% of the current coinbase....

It is a dilemma alright, but more for the seller. Should I mine for myself and withhold sales (thus making big profits now and ship it when the mining complexity increases) or sell it for much less of a profit margin?
To me the answer is damn obvious. Maybe not ethical, but any maker who ships now instead of just mine is an idiot. I would mine with each miner at least until it makes its production cost back, that way the whole machine's price is pure profit....

  I am not getting it, why do we need a transition? My point is, if I can choose between 2 virtual currencies with nearly the same properties, I will choose the one with less % concentrated in a few hands (people or institution).


  Sure not. If it is really a Ponzi, why would I want to know that my acceptance of the coins just make them more rich? If it is government made, why would I want to know that they can dump their coins at any time on the market and end the experience?


  Not necessarily. If I have 100K coins, right now I could slowly sell them into the market 20-30 or even less coins at a time without pushing the price down too much. On the other hand if crashing the price is my goal, I could dump it all at once... 


  This is an incorrect assumption. I agree there is demand, but not really at these price level. Lots of people are waiting for the price to pull back.


  First, in the real world I don't really have a choice, I have to use one currency no matter what. But with bitcoin, I can decide if I participate (and by doing so, I help to enrich early adopters), but I don't have to. Second, the concentration what early adopters hold is much higher than what a few people or institution hold with dollars and currencies.

  What do you think why people have been buying BTC in the last 2-4 months? They wanted a good returns on the goodies. Nobody wanted to use it when it has been appreciating 10-30% per week.
   So you can look at the profits as returns...
   A Ponzi can have a product. Most people think of Madoff when talking about Ponzis, but there are plenty of ponzis with tangible products. 
   Bitcoin sustain itself by bringing in new people. Without new people it would be a few dozen geeks messing with their computers.


  That is also a correct definition, if the dump was done by the early owners.
But again, just because some new thing has a revolutionary idea and/or technology behind it that doesn't mean it can not be a ponzi.
Bitcoin depended on the ever widening circle of users/adopters and making the earliest adopters richer. Do you know that most of the early coins have never been used? If the adopters were really altruistic, they should have spread it all to make people able to use it instead of hoarding it. Hey, we have a new currency! Alright, then give it to the people and let them use it.
  The very high concentration of bitcoins give us a clue what most early user wanted.
@_date: 2013-04-28 11:39:34
Interesting thought exercise, but his solution wouldn't work. To have a kind of peg to the dollar means nothing when there is FUD. Just think about what you would do in such a scenario.
I would try to sell (locally) or spend at close to the last market price. But most likely there would be no buyers or product sellers, because their guess would be that the coins' value will be tanking, so why would they pay me 133 (the current price) when in a few hours it might be 80 bucks or less?
So the answer to the OP is that market would crash, but people would still buy at a MUCH lower price. (hoping that the glory days of 266 bucks still will come back)
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:37:43
If I were them, I would have fed 90K of the coins slowly above $200 and used the last 10K coins to sell quickly to cause panic. If it doesn't work you still sold at a high price, if it works, you have a shitload of cash to buy back later cheaper...

Let's make it clear, you can have a valid, viable product and still run a Ponzi. It is not the luck of a product what makes it a Ponzi. It is the need for constant grow, and that the early adopters get paid from the newcomers money.

Not really moot because one is a passive the other is an active act. Not spending is passive, investing in bitcoin is active. Now if the money is needed for the user, there is no choice, they have to cash out. But if the purchase is not completely necessary right away, they are better to wait...

1. If I wrote fail, I misspoke, I meant fall, as in price. But whatever. Bitcoiners would think of it as a failure if it was just one of many of virtual coins with a valuation of let's say 3 bucks...
2. Valuation is relevant for the divisibility issue. The very small units are only usable if the BTC valuation is rather high. If it is not, there isn't enough coins to fulfill the role of currency.
3. A new coin could be created using a huge pool of users by distributing coins among a very large number of people, for example redditors each would get a coin. Now miners would get a very small fee as a transaction fee, thus they would be interested in keep mining. What is the point here? That it is still easy to introduce new coins, make them accepted by large number of people and compete with existing coins. So just shows that in the future there could be dozens of coins and BTC might be just one of them...

Thanks for the long and detailed answer.


So let's say if they can be used fairly the same ways for value exchange (the goal of any currency) wouldn't a all at once released currency be preferred to a long release?


I have issues with this statement. time will tell. Once the crashes start to occur, we will see just how good a SoV it is....  


  But banks also do the opposite (in a perfect world) and withdraw money from circulation when the economy contracts. This doesn't happen with bitcoin. Let's say we go into a worldwide recession for a decade. Bitcoin should be withdrawn, because less would be needed for the limited transactions. 


  Sorry, but that is not a good enough monetary answer. A quick very wide, semi-democratic release of all coins at once would do exactly the same.
   Bottomline is, between 2 virtual currencies I prefer the one that is less concentrated in the hands of a few people/institution.

There has to be some kind of business activity to show the source of money, but it is usually way less then what eventually declared. Like a restaurant. You had 50 dinners a night on average, but you account for 200 (hard to check) and the average profit multiplied by the phantom customers (150) is your money laundered profit. You do pay taxes on it, but it is clean money. Paying the taxes is the price of legitimizing money. Also in a business you can subtract plenty of costs from your taxes...
Another good business is laundry, drycleaning or take out buffet. I knew a Chinese take out where they had huge flat screen TVs inside but hardly any customers. Most likely a money laundering operation, because they are still in business...

You are right and the OP is wrong, Satoshi didn't think this through at all. He didn't see competition, he didn't know how an actual currency works and supplied according to needs.
  Bitcoin is either scarce or unlimited, depending on the price. If the price is low, it is scarce, if the price is very high, it can be pretty much unlimited, because the divisibility can be raised...

  That is your prerogative, but it is not an argument itself.


  What is so hard about designing it? Right now after Bitcoin's success it would be very easy to convince people, and nobody said it has to be done overnight, but if after 3 months you still haven't used your coin, we would give it to someone else.


  Again, prerogative, not an argument.


  This doesn't make sense at all. How Satoshi sitting on possibly millions of coins is fair? Personally I don't mind if he makes himself good money, but he doesn't need to be a 100 millionaire using my acceptance of his idea. A perfectly unfair system doesn't exist, but my idea would be better and more democratic then wasting energy and time in an unnecessary creation process.


  And my idea would prevent that how? 


  That is also a problem right now, so no difference. We are in price discovery mode.


  Oh, just like a Ponzi. You know that is one of the most important feature of a good pyramid scheme.


  Actually, after the original price discovery, price stability is preferred.

Forex is different that the currencies are freely available for average people to spend them. I would say at least 80% of the Bitcoins are NOT circulating (used for goods and services) If so, that is a huge % to be tied down. That leaves like 3 million bircoins to deal with the spending activity...

I still can't believe that they didn't even try to sell at least some of their holdings last year when price went parabolic first. The subsequent crash also could have made them lose faith and cash out at least a small %...
After all, there was no guarantee that:
-- the price would ever recover
-- there would be no competition
  There could be another reason: some huge amount is locked up in a way, that it has been temporarily inaccessible, but in the future it can still enter the market

I know what it is, and there is no reason it can not work eventually for LTC. If some big company decides to adopt LTC instead of BTC, there you go. 
   Zuckerberg could easily kill BTC. Create 400 million coins. Give out 300 million to every Facebook member. If someone doesn't want it or need it, just give it to your friend. Let's say you can buy something for it. Let's say they make a robust exchange for it. Then there is a networked, widely spread, popular and easily traded Facecoin that can easily beat any other coins. Oh yes, and Zucky kept 100 million for himself to control the market....

Seriously? You are bringing up the dotcom rush where 80% of the companies had no value whatsoever? I guess good analogy.
My point is 2 fold:
1. If they were in it for the better good, they should have spread the early coins.
2. Even if I allow for a little getting paid, I don't want them to be multimillionaires. A few 100K bucks for a few years of work sounds decent enough reimbursement.


I did miss out on the tulip mania. I also didn't buy pets.com stocks. 2 huge misses....


  I do. Actually not a new concept, in the late 90s there were online companies creating online money, for some reasons, none of them took off. But they did use up plenty of venture capital.
  Most bitcoin fans don't understand finance and/or psychology. Greed will prevent bitcoin to be a currency, and finance wise, that is not how the money supply works....

There are plenty of stocks specially penny stocks. But several of the high flying tech stocks of late 90s had the same chart patterns, like pets.com, webvan.com and such. Parabolic raises, with huge dropbacks.
Or a recent example, look up Panera bread (PNRA). In 5 years it went from 30 to 200 with 30-50 dollars drops on the way. The raise was more linear, but the drops were all there and buying opportunities.
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:52:23
There can be more than 1 bubble. There was one in June 2011, from 30 to 10 in 4 days. Last August it went from 15 to 8 in 2 days. And yesterday. The rest of the bigger drops were just corrections...
@_date: 2013-05-02 08:33:40


Because lots of different things:
-Competition increasing (and a much better version could raise, what is not even on the market yet)
-Government banning
-Hacking increasing and people hurt and getting disappointed
-Users realizing it is not the answer to all the financial problems
-Huge exchange crash
-Price staying extremely volatile
   Just imagine an average user who was enthusiastic first, but got hacked (stolen bitcoins), lived through 2 huge price crashes, than the government declares BTC illegal. How much of his enthusiasm will stay???

It is possible they can cash out privately. If you are the Winklevii, you might buy bitcoins with a discount so both parties are happy because:
1. The Winklevii (or any big bitcoin investor) defended the price, and it didn't crash because someone cashed out.
2. You got cash on your bank account, and didn't have to deal with the problems you mentioned...
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:31:31

@_date: 2013-04-18 17:15:03

@_date: 2013-11-22 16:12:27
Divisibility only helps if price increases a lot and that isn't guaranteed. If BTC stabilizes around 100$, what good does it do if we can divide it down to 0.000001 or whatever? Those units are still worthless, just like dividing a penny. Actually, a penny is rather worthless nowadays...
@_date: 2013-04-22 10:59:04
Because you can divide the smaller units forever. So more and more units can be created if needed (again, assuming the price goes up)

I want it better distributed (specially in the early stages), simpler to understand, and it should address the economic needs vs. money supply problem. It has to be very stable, with minimal volatility. Should be used as currency not as investment. Also a little government backing (at least a not outright banning) would help...
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:56:43
Beside what happened today, the market has no liquidity and there are huge price differences between the exchanges. In the real world arbitration would make those differences disappear. And I am not sure all 5-7 or whatever exchanges were DDoSed. They simply just couldn't handle the traffic, and we are only at the beginning of popularity. 40 minutes lag? They might as well just close shop...  I am sorry, but it looks like amateur hour...

So just by price alone LTC is 2 years faster than BTC. I am more than sure more coins have been created too. I think in the long run, it will be a good competitor to BTC.
But maybe our approach is wrong and instead of competitors, they should be looked at as the same. After all, the differences not so big and as long as the 2 are interchangable, what is really the difference?
  So maybe we are talking about something what is 105 million coins, instead of 21 or 84....
  Now I could easily see that there are other coins in the works that will have an even faster adopting time. What is my point? That competitors exist bitcoiners like it or not, and more competition also means less worth, not to mention less scarcity....(actually no scarcity at all)

Only if price increases a lot. Let's say price will go up every year only 5$ for the next 10 years, for easier math. If 99% of the coins are hoarded as investment, that 160K coins can't handle the currency role in 2014, and satoshis will be still worthless, because BTC is still just at $200

If you can have 1-10 mill dollars to lunch an attack, it is easier to manipulate price by simply buying and selling, no attack is necessary.
You start buying slow. If price keeps going up you can speed up your buying. Once you run out of money, you start to dump your coins. If you start slow and the price doesn't go down, you make profit. If the price falls a lot, you just buy it back with your profit and rinse and repeat...

The US government would like to disagree. But anyway, it is still a good example. There was a bunch of something what they wanted to distribute. They didn't give the best and most to their buddies first, did they?


  Sounds like an early adopter to me...


  Well, obviously you have to use it or lose it. The same with bitcoin. Lots of early adopters lost it eventually, becayse they didn't care for it, forgot about it,etc.


  What exactly is so risky about running my computer when I am not using it for a few hours per day? Also, how do you know it is not a giant fraud right now? If the real goal was making themselves rich (as opposed to making a working, widely used virtual currency) that is a fraud on every latecomer user.
  It is sure useful, when you finally made your product desirable. I started to look at bitcoin as a company, early developers were the board members and the ones who got the shitload of company stock, and once bitcoin started to take off, the benefits are all there...

I completely agree and that is my grievance with bitcoin, the unfair distribution of early coins. If it is a currency, try to spread it among as many people as you can in the beginning, so it can act as a currency. Hoarding isn't good for currency status...

But if they accept bitcoins, why shouldn't they accept other virtual money? For them it is business not a political statement.

2. Possible unlimited competition.
3. Price volatility never stabilizing, bad for currency status.
4. It is still too complicated for the average user. Think of Linux in the 90s....

It will never be stable. If it gets stable in the next 3 years that will mean 1 thing, it has got forgotten and unused, either by ban or overcame by competition.
Simply there is just not enough coins around to sustain a stable price and with relative low amount of coins or dollars one can move the market in either ways...

  Actually, it does. The number of units meaningful for purchasing something. Right now a penny is pretty close to worthless, a nickel still buys you something. So right now to express anything in Bitcoin smaller in value then a penny is pointless. But if the price increases, we can go the other way because the smaller units suddenly are worth something.

1. Because some folks might like to make/mine their own coin as a hobby or as a low cost entry into virtual currencies. Running the computer for a few hours is easier than opening a bank account for teenagers.
2. Bitcoin was the trailblazer, but we have it now as an example. 4 years ago except a few hundreds geeks, nobody believed they are worth more than a few pennies, and look at it now. But the point is, that a new coin doesn't need to make this trailblazing, BTC did it for every other coins.
3. Psychology. You have 100$ to waste. You could try to buy less than 1/10th of BTC or you might buy thousands of "new"coins and hope for the best. If you bet correctly, you might get a good return on your money. Bitcoin's value is already too high to make another huge return. 
4. Better distribution can make a new coin more popular. With bitcoin, the few early geeks and the founder got all the worms. If you throw a brand new, unmined system on the market, literally thousands would mine it, if for nothing, "just in case", it might be the new big thing. And there would be thousands of users right off the bat, unlike with bitcoin where this process took years.
5. The problem with bitcoin evolving is that you in a democracy you need lots of votes to make even a small change. A new coin's feature can be changed by the small team (even 1 person) who made it, so change is much easier...

  So if 5 years from now bitcoin trades around 2-5 cents, completely useless but Satoshi cashed out 10$ and above, does he still deserve to be a multimillionaire?

So? It just means change takes time. LTC is already way ahead of BTC in its timeline.
@_date: 2013-12-23 03:18:17
Sure he can. It would be against his personal interest, but you never know what his intentions are...
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:42:23
Well, what we could see, and what can happen are 2 things.  :)
What if a very viable and much better alt coin gets created? Where did you see BTC's value then?? What if 2 dozens of those are created???

But Ponzis do...
  Why would rewarding a good deed be communism?

like fingerprints
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:08:39
Where are those lenders, and what is their interest rates?
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:06:34
We don't need, but in a capitalist world there is such a thing as competition. deal with it.
Not to mention there are a few things with bitcoin to be fixed, so a newer, better system is not completely unnecessary...
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:23:42
Sure it is, but what holds it back to becomes successful? And it is most of the time Bitcoiners who talk poor little litecoin down, like competition is a bad thing or not allowed.
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:27:59
Yes, but you guys expect 4-6 magnitude more people to use it in the future. Do you think there are enough coins if everybody still hoarding it? And please don't come with the satoshi..
@_date: 2013-04-27 21:10:56
Wait, I have to cruise gonewildforBTC first.
But in case I do find such a person, do you agree with the OP then?
@_date: 2013-07-07 12:15:01
So you mean very likely? You do know that at least 3 times the world came to the brink of an all out nuclear holocaust?? read your history....

1. A finite amount can not work as currency, that's why the divisibility feature.
2. The point of early distribution is: make it more popular and get it circulated and avoid hoarding.
@_date: 2013-06-05 00:45:56
and your counter argument is...?
@_date: 2013-12-08 14:36:20
Because bitcoin was created as a currency. The value of bitcoin is really irrelevant for that purpose.
Your 3rd point is a good one, because divisibility kind of negates the scarcity of the coins....
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:28:32
2. There are plenty of counterparty risk with BTC, when exchanges and wallets just disappear overnight.
3. Myspace.
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:30:17
And you don't care about the real reason why it was created? What if its major goal to be a honeypot for criminals/terrorists?
Or the possible fact that the government has 2-3 million never used coins? They could dump it on the market at any moment?
 But you are right, why care about irrelevant things?
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:18:25
You mean like facebook stocks?
@_date: 2013-04-26 13:52:18
I know what a stop loss is, but in a thin market it doesn't work and you get a worse fill....  And anyway, as long as the price keeps going up (even with selloffs) you just have to ride it out...
Also, if your stop loss is too close, you might get kicked out of the position
@_date: 2013-04-26 02:27:40
If the bot's action is predictable, why not just join the action and make money? Sell high and buy back low at every 20-30 bucks drop. Not rocket science. beat the bot at its own game...
@_date: 2013-05-24 14:53:18


This is only possible if the coins are not used as currency. With wider usage it should go exponential...
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:34:13
Not a bad scenario, but I think most of the buying was from individuals. I don't think the market was liquid enough for a HF to come in with 20-50 million bucks or more...
@_date: 2013-04-14 12:34:25
Crying about the thread is good, explaining your argument is better....
@_date: 2013-04-21 20:14:12
The Satoshi team could be just 5 guys. I am more than sure more than 5 guys work for the NSA...
