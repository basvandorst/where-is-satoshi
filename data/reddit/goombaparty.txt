If the change ends up in another address then it is technically sent.  The title claims the bitcoin was sent not spent.  So the claim that 7 Trillion has been sent is correct.

It says the Bitcoin was sent, not spent, so the figure is correct.  Even change is being "sent" to another address.  It is a statement about the reliability of Bitcoin that so much value has been moved around without being lost.  They are not claiming that much was "spent" which is impossible to know.

3 bottles and 1 mag.  So 5 bottles worth.

No, you're not, you offer a whole six coins, one of them a famous scam.  That fact is not disputed yet you are selling it.
  


  
What a cop-out, you are perpetuating the scam by selling Paycoin.  Not only are you trying to profit from a scam coin, **your exchange rate is unreal(a scam).  Cryptsy.com who actually is coin agnostic, is exchanging them for .0001 while you are asking .04** as of this reply.
  


  
They do not have a sizeable market cap.  You appear to be pumping Paycoin and I think you're likely laundering for Garza.  I wouldn't touch you with a ten foot pole.

If you're so legit, how come you sell Paycoin, a known scam coin cooked up by a known scammer?

As of right now, shapeshit.io is not offering Paycoin, so I have nothing to ask him.

21inc has the potential to eat ethereum's lunch so I am holding off.

This is inevitable and you would think that Satoshi would have realized this after seeing how pools develop.

Satoshi grew up in California.
