Or just park it in a garage to look at like most people who drive excessively expensive and collectible cars

It certainly wasn't several countries trying to ban it and several online stores ceasing purchases with it.

The U.S killed hemp production, a traditional cash crop, in the 1930's.

Yeah, sorry.

Hopefully the miners will stop inflating the GPU market to 2-3 times it's value.

If this is intrinsic to the system, it will never be used as a currency. Companies don't want to deal with that. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 01:17:08




Wew boy. Call me when I can buy anything from anyone with it and not have it be measured in USD. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:12:48


 


@_date: 2018-02-02 00:04:28
A currency that is looked down upon by governments with nothing to keep value stable.
Sounds fundamentally sound to me.
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:59:35
Time to cash out
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:22:23


Why would I use this as money?

See ya saturday

Welp, be prepared for Reddit to go to shit again in 8 months when the elect another Pao

I may be an idiot but at least I'm not willingly ignorant like you.

The US is currently at war with 2/3 of those, and never stopped thinking it was with the other 1/3rd.

Kinda hard to build equity towards buying homes when the entire housing finance market collapsed in on itself. 
The reality of it is that your narrative that a 30 year loan will make someone who gets it at 40 work until they die at 80 or 90 is absurd.

Mobs and hiveminds are how Reddit works. Reddit stays strong because it managed to compartmentalize them and give them homes. Problem is now that you have several hundred if not thousands pitchfork wielding communities ready to go if they feel threatened by something they have in common. 
Shit has been nasty. I lurked for a long time.
I'm not a golden bastion of morality, I just blow off steam, but I'm not mob justice level bad. 
Edit: I made an account on Voat when it was hyped. If you thought Reddit was  gross, check out that carcass.

True value of anything is however much someone will give you for it.

Dead as a functional alternative to common currency.* 
You can still go on whatever version of silk road there is and buy your crack but you won't be able to put money down on houses.

What's the point of having money if I can only pay individuals? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:52:11
Typically it's a short term loan for the pay period. You're not *supposed* to go outside your means, it's just money to use until you get paid. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:32:45
The crypto is gone. It's digital @_date: 2018-02-22 00:12:20
My both my grandparents and my parents at least. 
Furthermore, you pay the mortgage with the equity of the home at sale. The money lost is in interest or decrease in value. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:04:37
At least I can purchase things with it in daily life easily. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:21:20
I hadn't heard that before but I wouldn't doubt it. The whole affair stunk to high hell.

About 1.1 Trillion, same as Japan. 6% of GDP.

Came for the innovation in cryptography application and networking. 
Back because I knew this was a bubble and I wanted to watch the fireworks. 
Wish coins would be less gpu-friendly. So bad for PC gaming.
