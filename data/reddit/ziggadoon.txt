Bitcoin doesn't have rules as much as it has rules of thumb. Miners can mine basically whatever transaction they feel like and you can make economic arguments that they rationally SHOULD mine one over the other but they don't actually have to mine any of your transactions at all and certainly not in the manner you want them to.

It's funny because in bitcoin you can do everything right and keep all your money in a safe cold wallet encrypted 700 ways and torn into a thousand parts and only stored in your own epoxied shut butt so the coins are 100% safe.
But it doesn't matter one bit because when an exchange is robbed you lose 10% of your wealth same as every single other bitcoin user.

On moving bitcoins randomly back and forth mostly. Less than 85,000 transactions a day happen that aren't just juggling coins between addresses.

The answer is that the big numbers involved mean that in a pure true random situation that would never happen.

Teenagers didn't force adoption of the internet. The internet was already being hugely and massively being adopted by the largest governments, educational and scientific and military and business and financial organizations on earth. Regular people bought it the second it became affordable for them to do so and in many cases bought in before it was really entirely reasonable for them to even have done that and just simply suffered through bad UIs and far to costly bills because the services were so appealing. 
With bitcoin none of that is the case. It used to be very easy to get in and now it's quite hard, large organizations are not leading the way and individual people need to be begged at to get them to try it.

Well first of all bitcoin can only handle around 250,000 transactions a day so bitcoin would need to shut down for almost 3 months just to process the transactions.

You sound like one of those people that think satoshi invented cryptography and encryption. 
Why would a blockchain be any help at all for a thing like that? What issue does it solve that couldn't be done better without a blockchain? You are just seeing every problem as a nail because you think you have a hammer. Read the whitepaper, blockchains are to solve a very specific issue with a p2p currency, past that you can use all the parts of them without a blockchain as people have been using them for decades. You don't need bitcoin to use private keys. You don't need blocks to update a text file.  
@_date: 2016-11-04 13:19:59
The developers would just hand reorganize the chain and pick different miners, all the crypto stuff is a pretty thin layer in bitcoin, none of it is set in stone, it's all optional and can all be easily changed by outside decisions as long as people go along with it.

Yeah, pretty much, it's about a 50 dollar piece of equipment that is sold to gullible consumers at 19,000 dollars each and sold to mining operations at 100 dollars each. It's hilarious when people try and calculate the value of the bitcoin network by pretending the miners buy these very very basic hashing circuits at retail price.

There has been many economic disasters bitcoin communities have cheered on but no one has ever been able to actually tie them to anyone actually putting money into bitcoin. It's always just some news story of some country having some vague economical problem then 9 weeks later the price of bitcoin goes up and people pretend that was a connection.

It turned out that an exponential curve was an embarrassing prediction for the price of bitcoin and every day he posted it it got off by more and more and he kept trying to change the focus to be about other things like pretending it was about "stability" but when that failed on his graphs too it never stopped being embarrassing and he had to stop.

You are 100% correct that bitcoin is a bad investment that won't pay out well but a whole heck of a lot of bitcoiners have convinced themselves and eachother bitcoin is a lottery ticket "to the moon" and will be worth millions of dollars any second now when it becomes the one world currency and ends taxes or whatever dumb stuff is always voted to the top of the page. It's a bad gamble, but a lot of people buy into the cult rhetoric about how big the payoff will be.

It costs $0.15 plus also the mining subsidy. 
@_date: 2016-11-07 16:34:00
I mean, that is the point. In real life bitcoin isn't a good gamble, but lots of people have told eachother it's a one weird trick bankers hate to get rich quick, hodl to the moon. And if you ask them it's a super good lottery ticket that is almost guaranteed to win. They will even tell you, if they are even 10% right they will be rich! So bitcoin attracts a lot of gamblers (who are dumb and gullible) 
@_date: 2016-11-04 17:30:17
You are confusing the fact a blockchain can be used for something with the blockchain being required to do that thing. Cryptography was not invented by satoshi. Neither was time stamping. We had this stuff before blockchains. Blockchains are good for a very specific solution to a very specific problem in p2p digital currency, you don't need it just to get crypto functions. We have crypto functions. 
@_date: 2016-09-22 16:58:27
Satoshi was perfectly willing to edit the blockchain when needed, he personally patched the code to drop 50 blocks and restart on a more valid chain after an early bug allowed the creation of 184 billion bitcoin. 
The blockchain can be edited if everyone agrees and even satoshi was willing to use that tool rather than let the protocol be hacked and destoried from a simple software bug.

Hmm yes, a good hypothetical estimate of nonspecific people that own on paper that own 1000*606 dollars worth of bitcoin if they sold right now. 
@_date: 2016-09-26 15:55:29
To send a transaction in bitcoin costs 5-15 cents a transaction. If they are living on 50 cents a day that is 10-30% of their entire budget per transaction. 
if you say "well they should use off chain solutions" then sure, but why even have bitcoin involved at all other than the hope them using it will make you richer? 
@_date: 2016-09-26 16:33:07
Is there? That is another things you always hear about in vague terms. Very non-specific cases of people that "must be" rich or "on paper could be worth" or so on, no one seems to actually be able to point to any specific person that actually specifically made more than a couple thousand.
It feels like an avon meeting, people TALK about the people that got rich doing avon, but you look into it and it's all people that netted a lot smaller numbers than they claimed and all drive rented cars to give the illusion they made it big. 
I hear a lot about people that "got rich" from bitcoin but every time anyone goes for specifics it's always a bunch of hypotheticals. A hypothetical person who is hypothetically rich.

Yeah, but it shows that bitcoin's blockchain being immutable is just not true, satoshi changed it. He had a good reason and everyone went along with it because it was reasonable but that is very different than "immutable". Lots of things can't be changed unless everyone agrees for them to be.

Weird, another hypothetical safe to say that people maybe might possibly have btc worth a certain amount if they maybe somehow sold all their BTC on an exchange at this exact second and were able to cash out and actually get their cash right now.

How are you unaffected? your bitcoin lost value exactly as much as the bitcoins on exchanges. You didn't escape anything.

That is a fun thing to say over and over but it's pretty easy to look and see that bitcoin exchanges hold a majority of the world's bitcoins and do more transactions a day than the blockchain does. Most bitcoin is held in bitcoin banks. Even if the banks regularly lose or steal the money. 
@_date: 2016-10-05 15:39:34

All of a sudden they decided that the most important thing in bitcoin was to give a discount at a protocol level to the sort of transactions lightning transactions might need.
