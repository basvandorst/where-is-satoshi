Grandma, is that you?

Mandrik is like the worst kind of drug dealer. Gives you a little taste, and once you're hooked, he gets out of the business. I *need* some more of that baklava!

Unfortunately, due to "Bureau" being in the name, people tend to be under the impression that the BBB is a governmental regulatory body with some type of police power. They're not that in the least.

Elbow deep inside the borderline, this may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to.

It looks a lot like curry on chips (popular snack food in the UK) but the cheese would definitely not be present if it were. I am voting for chili cheese fries as well.

"Fed" (singular, capitalized) refers to the Federal Reserve System or its individual banks (which are not actually governmental agencies, but private corporations. See *Lewis v. United States*, 680 F.2d 1239 (9th Cir. 1982)).
"The feds" (plural, not capitalized as a proper noun) would be a reference to any federal agencies or individual agents.

These days I would be highly suspect of anything being sold as MDMA (or anything, really) in or near a club. Definitely use a [DanceSafe test kit.](

That's what I took from it, too.
I'm old enough to remember even 20 years ago how much skepticism there was about the internet and its place within the future economy. When Amazon started in '94, the common response to someone selling books online was "that's stupid, we have book stores for that already!", and two decades later those book stores are all closed.

I'm glad I'm not a developer who has to deal with Google because they seem like such an impenetrable bureaucracy. They tell you you broke a rule, suspend your account/delete your app, never tell you what rule you broke, and good luck ever getting your account reinstated. You guys seem to have caught a huge break here, but that doesn't mean they won't pull this again in the future.

I worked in a computer store when that movie came out. We got about a dozen people a day (and more on the weekends) come in and ask where the clear laptops were.

Damn it, man, you need to at least do a special "limited edition" baklava release every so often. I am hooked on that shit.

These budget cutbacks have really hit the military hard.

Banks are highly discriminatory by nature. It doesn't surprise me at all.
