Am I missing something? Why does it matter who Satoshi is?
I know some countries have applied taxes to BTC but I don't understand why they'd be after him so heavily...

That is what I keep reading...the risk is so high and, with a family, I get nervous. With high risk though is high reward. At the moment, we can get by on fiancee's income and my freelance income can go to BTC until I get my business up and running...
Edit: I just signed up for coinbase (I was signed up for Circle and they never went through with the processing for my account after ~2-3 weeks). When you say now, do you mean RIGHT NOW, or do I have until the bank linking process completes?

Perfect. 
Except now I am questioning jumping in now and waiting a little longer. One site says it'll level out at $200. One says as low as $65. One at $135.
I read something short about Cost-Averaging. Maybe I'll do that by putting $50-$100 in whenever I have it each week and then if it starts climbing, dump it in (although right now, my BTC investment is only ~$150 until more invoices get paid)

I'm having issues redeeming my btc.  I tap get bitcoins, confirm I want to send them to my acct.  The circle appears for a second or two then it goes away and no btc and the points are still there. Is it something I am doing wrong?

I thought I saw somewhere before but can someone post the rewards? 
I think it was like 1000pts == ~$50 BTC
Nevermind..I found it
Add Pennsyltuckey to the map =)
