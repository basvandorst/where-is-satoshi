It's comparable in a sense but obviously a hyperbole. Here use our website to express yourself but follow these rules. Oh you're following the rules but we don't like what you're saying ok delete, delete, delete.
If you guys are aware moderator corruption is what led to the tech section being pulled off. Corruption on reddit is common. In fact in some sections business owners of the topic are moderators. Conflict of interest much? Bot or human makes no difference. Those in power always become corrupt without proper checks and balances.

We never violated any of the rules in the blocked/deleted posts. No addresses or even links.
Thanks we aim to get word out there!

All posts are now in our new thread here:

Once you claim an amount we suggest you transfer it to another wallet and remove the NFC tag to keep as your trophy.

Which area?

Anyone killing freedom of speech is a fascist. Read a book.
@_date: 2014-05-07 01:36:38
Your welcome. Thank you for participating. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 18:52:25
We have not broken any rules.

Hello Crypto-Chicagoans. 
Starting today our group will be "tagging" Chicago with bitcoin. We are putting NFC tags in bars all over the Chicagoland area containing a backup of an encrypted Bitcoin wallet key with values ranging from $1 to $100.
Requirements: You must have an Android smartphone with a NFC reader and have a bitcoin wallet installed. Also the password for all wallets is chicago to make it easy for everyone and all tags are locked for your safety.
After finding the tags post your find here and tell us what you think. I'll post more information when the team meets up at Big Chick's tonight to go over our mission.
Message us for any questions, suggestions, or support!

We appreciate the input but with only 1 redditor showing any interest in all of Chicago we will have to scape the project. A total of $150 was collected and the remaining $850 NFC tags placed throughout Chicago has been disabled. Maybe when Bitcoin is more mainstream we can try this again but for now we will focus our efforts on other NFC and Bluetooth bitcoin software and hardware programs within our group.

Thank you for being a supportive community member.
@_date: 2014-05-03 22:52:43
Can you up-vote this so the community can judge this for themselves?
@_date: 2014-05-04 02:11:33
Everyone should email them and voice their opinion.
@_date: 2014-05-04 09:27:00
There needs to be a checks and balances system between moderators and users. Ultimately the users should have the last say in how things are done and they should be done in a fair way in which no user is banned or deleted when he's not violating any rules.
@_date: 2014-05-04 02:02:30
See  for all updates.  Hopefully this one won't get autobanned or blocked.

Hint  At the bar we met up with there's 2 NFC tags both easily spotted if you know what you're looking for. One is by a machine you will have to visit before buying a drink and the other is if you decide to go out back for a smoke. Please confirm here if found and remove the NFC tag to claim as your trophy.

Also there's one thread that links to ours as thankfully someone saw our post before it was deleted here:
It doesn't seem to even come up on reddit or under a search for Chicago under reddit bitcoin.
Weird and abit totalitarian. I thought freedom of expression was welcomed on reddit provided it's not hurting anyone. 
@_date: 2014-05-07 01:40:31
Last week of our project in Chicago. We thank everyone to played a role!

Well after what happened in their Tech section I guess I can't be surprised. Moderators should inform citizens why they are deleting or removing a thread especially when one is following the rules, otherwise it's not much better than arresting someone with no cause.
@_date: 2014-05-04 18:54:41
There's no proof of that. Besides restricting free speech by any means bot or not goes against the 1st amendment.
@_date: 2014-05-03 22:46:32
And the community isn't doing anything to change things?
@_date: 2014-05-04 02:12:38
See  for all updates.
@_date: 2014-05-03 21:36:58
We successfully tagged 10 bars and will be revealing more hints at the end of tonight.
@_date: 2014-05-03 21:38:06
We just started and will be posting locations later tonight. Bonus bitcoins to anyone who finds them beforehand.
@_date: 2014-05-04 09:28:36
Including content that follows the rules? Which is pretty much fascism. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 22:45:15
Not sure how our non-profit group giving away free bitcoins comes into play there.
