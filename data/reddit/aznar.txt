Leading opinion of Core devs is that high fees is something to celebrate, not to fix (fee market yay!!!). So... nop
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:08:43
I forgot the /s, "Low processing fees" and "Fast peer-to-peer transactions" is *literally* on the frontpage of bitcoin.org	
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:45:42
Exact same thing was said about SegWit aaaand here we are.

"Likewise, go beyond a certain amount of data in the blockchain and the network sinks by losing its decentralization which is what gives it its security. "
This is nonsense!!! Both statements

That was fake news to pump...

This is some kind of stress test, not your everyday tx

Segwit was a soft fork. BCH was a hard fork. Both forks
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:43:55
This is awful news, period.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:30:11
No problem it's gold, no one said it should be cheap to use

Attack? Someone is testing... That's what testnets are for right?
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:37:55


At what price the bubble starts for you?
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:20:59
Let's see if the fees go down, so far they haven't.
@_date: 2018-09-25 11:54:02
You are right, and it's a hardfork. 1.5 introduced a bug as softfork, deeming as valid blocks that shouldn't, and this fix is a hardfork, making them invalid again. Thats the definition of hardfork, a change that makes blocks that where previously deemed valid, as invalid.
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:39:57
That makes no sense, even if you forget about USD and value everything in BTC there are variances, bubbles and whatnot: how much BTC per lamborghini/house/bread is a bubble?
@_date: 2018-05-08 13:06:05
So... pitchforks? New enemy of Bitcoin?

It would be an interesting test. Try to sync with the first Bitcoin wallet. Any volunteers?
My bet is no sync
@_date: 2018-05-07 07:30:04
You'll not sync with a 9 year old client...
@_date: 2018-05-25 18:45:02
So... if there is no censorship here, no problem in taking the offer.... right?
@_date: 2017-02-27 07:09:19
As a user I stopped using BTC for small amounts due to high fees. It's a pain, and getting worse each day!
@_date: 2017-03-25 07:59:41


I'm not even sure if you think that or are just trolling
@_date: 2017-03-31 08:23:04
So Core should code an scaling proposal that can be backed up by a vast majority.
What about 2MB block with malleability fix, so LN can continue? (without segwit)
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:56:17
Localbitcoins just advised everyone to be patient because the blocks are full. 
It's surprising the amount of people who thinks that there is no problem. I don't understand.
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:13:28
You can buy from Bitmain, from Canaan, or, for high budget, Bitfury.
I'd love to see more players, but how is this Bitmain's fault?
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:11:14
They do. Their miners are more expensive though, but they sell to everyone interested.
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:06:03
What would exchanges list as BTC then? Core with the new POW, Core with the old POW or BU?
@_date: 2017-03-25 07:00:48
If they fork it will be a contentious hard fork and not be considered and named Bitcoin on the exchanges, following their own rules. If they don't impelnent replay attacks protection, there is the possibility that they don't appear at all in the exchanges. 
In that case "real Bitcoin" will be 1mb + no Segwit, am I right?
@_date: 2017-03-26 15:27:53
Is it necessary to insult?
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:30:44
Bitfury is an alternative. Not for small miners thought :(
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:40:34
This. The more plausible the fork seems, more people will sell. So for the love of God, reach an agreement already
@_date: 2017-03-17 11:48:44
Glad you did, but that reasoning scares me. It's way off. You can apply it to buy lottery tickets. Or go to the casino. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 07:53:12
If BU implemented code like this, it will be labelled as an "attack on Bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-03-25 06:54:51
There is already a third provider, it's called canaan, this will be a fourth

@_date: 2017-03-17 11:46:16
Yeah let's get back to 100$ so fees are ok
@_date: 2017-03-24 09:59:30
Let me understand:
1) BU signaling is meaningless.
2) BU miners are forcing other miners to "convert" by attacking them.
3) Segwit signaling is meaningful.
Is this correct?
@_date: 2017-03-25 07:51:43
They will fork to another chain, BTS?
Great way to solve the problem guys, more forks!!
@_date: 2017-03-25 07:09:58
This never happened, Bitcoin loosing market share? First time ever
@_date: 2019-03-19 12:33:39
This is a completely backwards argument. People with no electricity can pay with fiat money, and cannot access their bitcoin. Are we losing our minds here?
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:05:15
This is a very good resume of the state of affairs. Now, what can we do to fix it?
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:53:58

Tried to withdraw some coins and, 24 hours later, nothing received and tx is "pending approval"
It doesn't look good....
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:09:14
No ID, BCC enabled, 2 blocks confirmation
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:13:28
Could be, yes, current dump coincided with the blocks. Let's see!!
EDIT: Actually timings are almost perfect, I think you are right
@_date: 2018-10-22 13:29:45
The fact that you thought that that unknown exchange can be trusted speaks volumes of the easy-to-fake metrics that aggregators use...

@_date: 2018-10-21 14:04:43
No, it's not. CMC has no means to know if my exchange AznarCoin is faking volumes or not. They can suspect it, if I fake too much and it's obvious that a made up exchange cannot have huge volumes, but that's about it.
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:02:19
They require 2 confirmations. Blocks ARE being confirmed.
@_date: 2017-08-08 11:22:43
That is not true, you have both on chain and off chain scaling options. It is meant to be the next world currency from the beginning. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:27:59
10/10 Would dump again?
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:21:06
That is not true, I just deposited BCC in HitBTC.
Edit: OK, some exchanges have limited deposits, others don't. Not "no one" anyway but there is an offer problem
@_date: 2017-08-06 17:20:46
Very interesting. I would like to know also how many people own 1 BTC or more right now. Maybe more than 2 million already
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:01:47
Oh my god, did you even check?
@_date: 2017-01-11 19:33:30
Hi, 
Can anyone explain (like I'm 5) why miners don't want segwit? From my very limited understanding I don't see any disadvantages so.... Help?
@_date: 2017-08-06 17:21:59
That is totally the goal. What do you think the goal is, if not to replace fiat?
@_date: 2018-06-10 08:03:32
Your pkey stay local decrypted in your browser, problem solved
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:01:27
There are blocks!! 
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:18:09
HitBTC right now, but need 6 confirmations for BCC.
EDIT: Now just 2 confirmations
@_date: 2018-06-08 17:55:15
Many startups working on those projects already!!!
@_date: 2018-06-08 16:59:53
That is not true, a web wallet can and should implement js code executed locally and not need to send your private keys.
If they send/have your keys, they are either bad product or a scam
@_date: 2019-02-16 09:33:33
Its based on Quorum, a fork of Ethereum, so it IS blockchain. And crypto also, if your definition of crypto includesUSDC or tether. Or Ripple

@_date: 2018-03-15 07:00:37
You are assuming that the tech will hold, that may be the case, but maybe not and bugs/0days bring the network down/create infinite btc/whatever. In that case it could reach 0
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:26:01
That's a possibility... other possibilities/scenarios can lead to 0

@_date: 2018-03-04 04:50:19
This is not only about Bitcoin Cash or Coinbase, literally every other listing in every other exchange has this issue.
Listing is a long process, that involves many people. You can buy/sell most crypto anonymously, and many decentralized exchanges are poping up all over the place. 
It's simply not enforceable to try and prevent this kind of stuff
@_date: 2018-03-01 06:47:49
You have a point there
@_date: 2019-01-24 12:32:18
That is a very low figure, you could 51% attack the network for some hours and double spend with just tens of thousands of dollars worth of electricity, not even hundreds of thousands.
@_date: 2019-01-11 18:23:27
@_date: 2019-01-02 11:08:31
Mine was ok
@_date: 2019-01-24 13:32:25
At that time there were not as many ASICs in existence as now, the cost of building new ASICs just for attacking is much higher than renting them. If the security of the network goes down progressively, ASICs become decommissioned progressively and part could be up for rent, driving the price of the attack down. That doesn't happen when the security is going up, since all the asic in existence are likely to be used 
@_date: 2019-01-05 20:29:25
Care to elaborate further? I don't see anything there
@_date: 2018-03-28 18:49:16


This is the most worrying part of the post IMHO

A GPU is nothing more than an ASIC for graphic processing. They certainly know how to design and build chips, I say this is awesome news for cryptocurrencies.

Stopped reading when it defines Bitcoin as a safety critical system... wtf?
For information about PoS:
@_date: 2018-03-01 06:45:44
It's more complex than that. Check this, for example:
@_date: 2018-02-25 09:20:02
We need a definition of decentralization, an objective way to measure it, and a target decentralization level.
Without that, this is just throwing concepts to the debate without any meaningful meaning.
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:46:17
Why 750k? Why not 800k or 600k? Is there any research on the optimal block size, than can be applied instead of try/error?
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:44:29
Bitcoin devs INCREASED the blocksize... They bought more beds.
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:49:47
Node count is an awful definition and easily spoofable. Let's say tomorrow there are two million Segwit2x nodes. Is that Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-04 08:01:11
This means slush will not allow its miners to choose? That was a great policy IMHO
@_date: 2017-10-02 07:24:32
Care to make mod logs of r/bitcoin public in a proper way?
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:56:32
So your definition is "whatever is in a certain github repository"? That is giving all power to developers. We need a better one.
@_date: 2018-02-26 08:35:13
No definition, no justification...just arbitrary numbers. Why not 5%, 15%? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:01:53
Code from a certain repository. A proper definition of bitcoin should not be "whatever rules are included in a certain repository at a certain time" 
BTW is a definition that will change over time... it's just awful
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:48:21
Witch ones should be there in your opinion?
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:37:34
If those numbers are "calculated" based on nothing or via authority, that's a problem. If they come based on research, risk management and proper calculation, I don't see the need for any authority.
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:32:15
What is Bitcoin?
Serious question, before discussing we need a definition.
Edit: For reference, here's the one from Gavin:
*“Bitcoin” is the ledger of not-previously-spent, validly signed transactions contained in the chain of blocks that begins with the genesis block (hash 000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f), follows the 21-million coin creation schedule, and has the most cumulative double-SHA256-proof-of-work.*
Anyone else have a better one?

@_date: 2018-04-01 09:52:31
Lol, yeah you have a point, right now GPUs are widely used for many other things and they are much more than just Graphics Processing Units. They were originally designed for that purpose though.

"If segwit is not MASF activated by July 2018, there will be enough of the economy running BIP149 that nodes can begin enforcement."
How can you know that?

It is not opt-in, check this:
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:07:04
Fortunatelly BCC comes with replay protection, transactions in BCC will not be accepted in BTC and vice versa
@_date: 2017-05-29 12:37:44
And the ones signaling Segwit are NOT signaling BIP148. 
BIP148 hashrate is 0Th/s right now. Which means there won't be an UASF chain. Which is very good news IMHO
@_date: 2017-07-30 13:20:04
From the link:
What is a replay protection?
Bitcoin Cash (BitcoinABC) implemented a two-way replay protection, by adding a Bitcoin Cash-specific change to the format of their transactions. After the fork, Bitcoin Cash transactions must contain a special value to be considered as valid transactions. This special content also renders them invalid on the original Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2019-05-08 10:42:23
Only this aberrant transaction and coins generated after it in the block chain will be removed. All other transactions will continue to exist.
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:34:36
I'd say even more, all that with only one eye open.
@_date: 2019-05-08 13:23:20
I was paraphrasing something said many years ago... :)
@_date: 2019-05-08 09:40:41
It's totally doable to reorg without any fork whatsoever, and should be done if necessary. A 7k theft does not count as necessary. A billion inflation bug count as necessary.
This was successfully done in 2010 BTW. So to the guys saying its not possible... well, it already happened.
@_date: 2019-05-08 10:39:56
It's a reorg to bypass one transaction exactly like the one Binance guy proposed
@_date: 2019-05-08 17:57:02
That's literally what happened. Check the link
@_date: 2019-05-08 13:22:17
It totally reversed one transaction forever and many temporarily. Rolled back lots of blocks....
@_date: 2019-05-08 15:00:56
Rolled back dozens of blocks, hours of mining...
@_date: 2018-12-20 10:36:41
JS part is BS. Also, you don't need to print the pkey. People make mistakes and lose coins? Sure, with hw wallets also.
There are lots of crypto lost due to hw wallets being set up and reselled for example.

1) Register on  or any other exchange that has BCC. That one is not chinese.
2) On Aug1, send only your BCC there (trezor/ledger will support)
3) Sell for BTC, send your BTC back to you

Agree, what happened to binance does not justify it. But the method itself is real, doable, worked in the past and may help in the future in case of disaster.
