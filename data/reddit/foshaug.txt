Agreed, but using open source as an argument that the software is secure does not hold true.

Fjordo, you're missing the point. The point of the exercise is that you're supposed to figure out what you would want to do if...

No thank you.

This happened to me a while back and it was annoying as hell to get 2FA turned off on all my accounts etc. 
Lessons learned:
1. Save the QR code images when adding accounts. If your phone etc is erased you can add the same account back in by scanning your saved QR code image.
2. On iOS I strongly suggest you use something like [Authy]( instead of Google's 2FA app as it has the ability to backup your 2FA.

"PC Load Letter"? What the fuck does that mean?

I agree that it should be somewhat difficult to get 2FA turned off on an account. 
Google has a nice system in place with a code sheet, the ability to use SMS and even phone calls in some case in order to access your account page, where you can turn off 2FA yourself. 
Its the sites that don't have an SOP in place that becomes problematic, and you will have to convince the sysadmin to turn it off. This usually (hopefully) involves sending them a scanned copy of an official ID. 
Some sites don't even have a method of contacting support without first being authenticated. This makes it very difficult to get in touch with the right persons.
