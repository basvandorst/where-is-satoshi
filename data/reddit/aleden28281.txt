I think you’re missing the point

Again, you’re the second person to come in here, give this bs answer with no reasoning and expect me to believe that when successful traders utilize it all the time. You do realize that it just boils down to supply and demand right? Have you even tried to learn it? I’m genuinely surprised if you have any knowledge of TA and think this way.

Gotcha, thanks for the recommendation. I’ll take my question there.

It’s very obvious to me that you don’t even want to learn what it is when you refer to it as a bunch of random lines. For some reason, you just can’t accept that it’s widely used by successful traders and that there’s a legitimate theory to it. I’m questioning whether you even know about the theory of supply and demand, because that’s where it’s based from. Since you won’t give me the time of day to understand it, then I see no point in even trying to explain it to you. I don’t understand why you’re so ignorant when it comes to these things, you keep saying it’s bullshit with no reasoning. I gave you a valid response as to why and how it works and yet you can’t even grasp it. It’s sad to see that you think of it as a big conspiracy theory so I hope you don’t approach every new study like that. I’ll leave these links here for you in the hope that you’ll be able to wrap your head around what it is

I can only imagine how all those bitcoin futures traders felt after that happened today lol. They either nutted or shit their pants. Or both.

It’s very easy to identify selling/buying pressure. When you see that there is excess supply through TA, you can short the asset and ride the trend down until you see confirmation of buying pressure because of increased demand through TA again. And the opposite applies when there is excess demand. You identify the point where buyers come in and ride the trend until you get confirmation of selling pressure through TA. I encourage you to learn more of technical analysis since you don’t appear to know much about it, but your question really just boils down to “does the theory of supply and demand help you know where price is headed” which obviously it does. I havnt even mentioned things like support and resistance so there’s a lot of wonderful techniques and methods that help you determine trends and price direction. It isn’t some magic trick that will tell you exactly what you need to know, it works best when used with fundamental analysis, but I promise you that isn’t just hocus pocus. It’s a real study with grounded principles in supply and demand.

I didn’t say I was perfect at it, still have much to learn about it! That said, at least I give the time of  day to learn about a study instead of immediately proclaiming it false. I could easily just say that the theory of evolution is false since I never learned it, the Bible says that god created the universe and thus it can’t be true. I HIGHLY encourage people who call it bullshit to actually take time out of their day to learn what they don’t understand. And as I said before, TA is best used with fundamental analysis. Short term trades on price movement can be done almost exclusively using TA but the longer your time frame for a trade is, the more fundamental analysis becomes handy to use with TA. It’s sad to see people who don’t understand it proclaim its bullshit without ever trying to understand what it is and the methods behind it. Hopefully one day you’ll be able to grasp it!

Neither do I, hard to imagine that it’ll drop below the $3300 it was at in February. My guess is in the absolute worst case scenario it could drop to the $4000s but with the halving coming up in May, I think we will definitely see a solid bull run next year.

Im confused to your line of reasoning, because you havnt personally seen anyone successful with it you think its just impossible? How do you explain how successful daytraders who make money almost exclusively on TA? You think they just dont exist? Jim Simons runs a quantitative hedge fund which makes around 80% return a year from almost solely using TA. Have you ever tried to learn it? I'm really puzzled by your line of reasoning.
@_date: 2019-12-03 00:55:14
How so? You don’t think that technical analysis has any merit in crypto trading? Why would it be any different than other asset trading? Curious to know your reasoning. There are strong patterns in bitcoin price action so I believe that TA still applies here but if you have any reasons to the contrary I’d love to hear them.

Oh buddy you could not be more wrong, I’m a registered Democrat but I don’t take kindly to cringy political jokes that have been told hundreds of thousands of times in the past 4 years. Why don’t u scuttle off to r/PoliticalHumor, I’m sure they’ll love half assed trump jokes that have nothing to do at all with what was being discussed earlier.
@_date: 2019-12-14 11:01:58
It was never about trump u dickhead, I wonder if you try and vent your frustrations about politics in every sub you go to.

I want to see what people’s thoughts on price direction are and what their reasoning is. I think that it will go down more since it broke below the upward channel it was in and is struggling to break above resistance. Would be interested to see if anyone else thinks the same about this and if there are more deprecating factors I don’t know about. If anyone disagrees with me I’d also like to hear their reasoning too. Sorry if the title was too vague.
