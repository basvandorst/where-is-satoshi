Say it takes 100 BTC in up front cost to mine some altcoin. After that, for every 1 BTC you throw at power, bandwidth, etc, you mine 25 BTC, thereby netting 24 BTC. Pretty soon you can afford the up-front capital cost again, and double your mining capacity.
The first miner to plop down the initial 100 BTC will be the first miner to double their capacity, who will eventually be the 51% miner.
It *doesn't matter* what the proof-of-X happens to be. SHA256, X11, Storage, P2P pools, etc...  So long as the marginal cost is lower than the up front capital investment, there is runaway feedback loop leading to a centralized 51% miner.
Cryptocurrencies haven't really changed much of the big picture structure, they've just started a new race for a centralized banker.

I'm so tired of hearing this. It's absurdly, demonstrably false. Study after study shows this.
Take the friendship graph of facebook, then "anonymize" all entries by removing "real life" identifying information so that all you are left with is the abstract graph. This tells you *almost everything you need to know about the underlying relationships*.
Take the phone call metadata, and obscure every phone number with an opaque unique identifier, so that you are left with the abstract graph of which numbers calls which. This tells you *almost everything you need to know about the underlying relationships*.
Once you understand the underlying relationships, "identity" details like names, phone numbers, DNA, religious affiliation, illegal drug purchasing habits, etc... are a hop skip and a jump away.
**tl;dr:** The relationship graph *is* the most important aspect of identity. All the other details are trivial to uncover, given the relationship graph.

Sorry if my scenario was over-simplified. I'm trying to focus on the fundamental problem.


It doesn't matter. They all have the same fundamental flaw: the marginal cost of mining is lower than the initial investment. Therefore: centralized mining.


That's just a simplification. Sure, maybe the first miner fails because of infrastructure or financial logistics. The second miner fails because they don't invest 100% of their earnings into more mining gear and instead buy a yacht.
The 47th and 48th miners band together, they purchase shipping containers packed with liquid coolant pumps and solar panels. They never fail to reinvest their earnings into more mining equipment. There is no way you or I or everyone on this subreddit could pool resources to compete with them. Game over.
So people wine about how it's all because of SHA256 ASICS, so let's do X11 + proof-of-stake, etc... It doesn't matter. These all have the same flaw.
I'm still a fan of cryptocurrencies, though, and I still think we should keep researching different proof-of-X approaches, and launching new blockchains, because the churn helps new players enter the field. Maybe someone will invent a proof-of-X that *actually* prevents centralization.

A scene from 1995:
"How could this system of ordering products and services over the World Wide Web help people pay bills and eat?
How would they pay their rent?
How do they buy food?
How do they pay the babysitter?
And how do they do this without waving a magic wand and declaring that everyone, everywhere uses the World Wide Web."
I agree that adoption is key, and it might take 15 years, and it *might not happen for block-chain cryptocurrencies*. Yet, all of that was true of the web in 1995.
**Edit:** Notice also, that for the case of the web it used to take forever to order something by mail with a check and receive a package.

Why do current miners buy more equipment?
If you had 23% of the mining power, would you not want to grow to 24%?
Think about any other industry. There is always an incentive to approach monopoly.


If I personally owned 20% of today's Bitcoin mining power, how much money do you think I would have at my disposal? If there were a fork, and my options were to give up, or to spend my considerable resources to have an advantage in the new system, which would I choose?
If I *already* am winning the race to acquire custom ASICs for one PoW system, why would someone else beat me in a new PoW system? I am already winning.

The transaction must include the outputs which it spends. Suppose you receive a payment to address A, then you take a snapshot of the blockchain and private key of A and save it offline. After this, another payment is made to address A.
Now, with the offline system, you should be able to spend all of the first transaction, but none of the second transaction. You can also see the balance, offline, up to that first transaction- the offline system will see a lower balance than blockchain.info.


This is an excellent idea. I also want this kind of system which can generate the *entire transaction* offline, and then I can deliver the transaction to an online node to execute it. In fact, this sounds like the kind of product big players would gladly pay for.
Does anyone know of a product like this?
It would still have the problem that it can only spend funds send to the address prior to the snapshot. A more sophisticated system would allow one to deliver blockchain updates offline. In addition to being a pain, once there is bi-directional data transfers like this there's a larger chance of hacking.
**Edit:** Added the detail that offline systems which have a blockchain snapshot can see old balances.

The frontpage mentions zerocoins and basecoins, the latter being non-private. Anyone may convert between the two, and the zero-knowledge stuff allegedly preserves currency units.
If all of that is true, then the mining algorithm, or whatever the source of new coins is, can be in basecoins, so that everyone will know the total supply (barring breaks in the crypto).
Did I misunderstand their website or your worry?

Ok, so putting aside our different theories, here's a simple empirical question:
Are there more people mining bitcoin now, or are there fewer, larger organizations with large capital competing and driving out smaller, less centralized competitors?
I guess I have been assuming the latter is true, but I haven't actually done the legwork to verify it. I recall seeing an article about a miner in Hong Kong who was loading shipping containers with a custom liquid nitrogen coolant systems + hundreds of ASIC units. That to me says economies of scale, which says centralization.

Since you can't buy BTC for BsF, locals probably don't have BTC to pay you. So you need to sell to tourists.
Let's say you run a hostel and accept BTC under the table (and over the internet). Now you start accumulating BTC and what do you do with it?
Maybe the ability to sell BTC for USD abroad would make BTC attractive to some locals who want to preserve their savings, and you need BsF immediately to buy food. What are the chances though?

The problem is that there won't be instant liquidity between regulation zones, if there are some zones which require "know your customer and keep 10 years of transaction history". In those zones there will be no way to transfer into a Dark Exchange which will create a barrier reified on the blockchain.
Such barrierrs could be a killer because of the network effect. If you are coming to bitcoin new, do you choose to buy some from the highly-regulated exchange which allows payments to Amazon, or do you buy from the dark exchange which allows payments to 3D Gun Printers Club, but which Amazon cannot legally accept?

Not true. If the marginal cost of the proof-of-X scheme is as high as the up front capital cost, or in other words, if there is 0 capital cost, this is the best case.
If the up front capital cost is greater than zero, and the marginal cost is less than that, then there is a race to be the biggest miner. The capital cost slows down new comers and the revenue from mining can be dumped back into mining to give super-exponential growth.
If the capital cost is 0, then the growth is "merely exponential". For example, *anyone* may get a 10% return per year.
Proof-of-stake is a hopeful approach. We probably need a few more iterations on it before it's ready for prime time.
With pure proof-of-stake there is "nothing at stake", so a single entity can mine every possible block simultaneously. A hybrid PoW/PoS scheme re-introduces the centralization problem of PoW.

Recovering from transcription or account-swapping errors is a distinct issue from bank responsiveness.
If a network of banks chose to remain always open and always process transactions in a given amount of time, then that would have all of the benefits of bitcoin I outlined in [my post above](
In fact, I suspect bitcoin, along with many other different technological advances in finance, is putting pressure on banks to close transactions faster.
There are at least three sources of bank delay: one is for regulation, fraud prevention, and state security reasons.  The other is that other banks have their own delays.  The third is because bank workers don't work 24/7 and they rely on old technology.
I was specifically complaining about the last category.
BTW- If the employee makes a 1 digit error in bitcoin, it will almost certainly not be a valid address.  Using a different, valid, but incorrect address is a much more likely error.

I agree the bitcoin network is spread over more jurisdictions than any given regulation. But so is traditional banking. And yet we see a monolithic global regulation culture of traditional banking, don't we?
Legal prosecution in one country can easily freeze assets in another country if it's the "right kind of crime". I'm sure Russia, China, US, EU, most countries with 95% bitcoin mining share would all gladly freeze the assets of child pornographers or Islamic terrorists at the request of any peer country.
I predict within 5 years miners in China, the US, or the EU will be required by regulation to implement a "freeze" function that filters transactions deemed to be relevant to law enforcement. The bitcoin network as a whole may not filter, because it will be more profitable to mine outside of those jurisdictions.
Maybe I should literally bet some BTC on this.

This is a great point. 
The value of storing the blockchain locally is to verify transactions and to look up the correct output indices on spends. So in that case it's worth paying something for those abilities.


I don't think the assessment can turn negative, in the sense that it's probably never possible to verify transactions or spend outputs without at least some verifiable part of the blockchain. Of course it's always possible to delegate those responsibilities to a third party service.
I see the important part of the economics is the "sign" of the values, not the magnitude. So if space and bandwidth is "almost free" and we prune the blockchain, etc, etc... we are only changing the magnitude of costs, not the sign/direction.
Let me put it like this: when a chemical factory spends 24 hours dumping carcinogens into the air in China, it costs my lungs very very little. In the aggregate though, it may be a very serious planet-wide problem. No matter how little it dumps, it's still carcinogenic and it's still in the air. The magnitude may be relevant - if it were so little that even after a billion years no one would ever be affected, then great.

For some reason when people compare altcoins, they discuss differences in the maximum mined units of those altcoins. Here's an [example comparison between bitcoin/quark](
At first I thought this is ridiculous because the exchange price simply incorporates whatever arbitrary units exist. It seems like the total number of coins is a big red herring compared to more important fundamentals, such as block reward rate, unit distribution, or (for some altcoins) the lack of a unit cap.
This post helps me understand why people are preoccupied with these arbitrary units. Thanks!
Here's a proposal for all capped altcoins including bitcoin: There are two new units called Whole and Atomic for each altcoin. 1 Whole is all possible currency in the altcoin. All other amounts must be fractions less than 1 Whole. 1 Atomic is the smallest indivisible unit (so 1 Atomic = 1 Satoshi in bitcoin). An interesting ratio for any altcoin is the ration of Whole / Atomic.

Running SHA256 a thousand times takes a certain amount of time longer on your CPU, but it's a much smaller increase in time on an ASIC miner.
One recommendation here is to use scrypt instead. scrypt is *specifically* designed to resist specialized hardware for brute-forcing.

Let's imagine that a regulator says "anyone is free to use bitcoin for personal use, but they must not accept any transaction that can be traced back to this set of Al Qaeda child porn drug smugglers."
What happens?
I imagine there could be enough disruption to kill bitcoin. I can also see a resilient network surviving this. It's really hard to say.
What is easy to say is that if this were *not possible*, then it could not disrupt the network. I'm not sure if we can make it impossible.
Zerocoin seems like a good start. Here's a litmus test: if we assume zerocoin protocol solves the major hurdles (trusted bootstrap, expense of transaction verification/size) then will bitcoin merge it in?
