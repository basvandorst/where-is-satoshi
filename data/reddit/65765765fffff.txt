Confusing the market place won't help.

Calls it Electronic Cash.
Models it after gold.

You give BCH way to much credit. It has a lot to prove. It's done nothing yet. Merely riding on BTC's coat-tails.
Litecoin, for example, has far more credibility.

Neither, at least, are anything like cash.

All riding on Bitcoin's coat tails.

Nothing like. Cash by definition is physical, it's limited in denominations and real world transactions are not recorded, and the supply is not fixed.
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:38:18
Why did he model it on gold, then? And where is he if he cares?
@_date: 2017-08-03 23:18:14
I thought the markets were supposed to decide everything?
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:40:48
I think your post proves the OP's point. It wasn't a dig at him.
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:58:29
Sentiment is exactly all it is at the moment. Let's see.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:03:37
Should they force it on people?
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:32:46
How about Bitcash?

I expected his head to fall off a precipice.
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:45:27
I didn't even notice. I was looking at the figures at the bottom.
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:59:02
It's not a rally.
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:36:55
It's going to end in tears. It's not enough like cash and too similar to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:10:21
Wait till more exchanges have it. No way it will stay that high.
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:05:58
And XBC is Bitcoin Plus.

Because of network effects, Bitcoin is more secure, better infrastructure etc.
