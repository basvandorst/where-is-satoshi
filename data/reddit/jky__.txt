@_date: 2016-08-06 18:55:24
it's not hijacking a project if the people who run that project make those desicions! Core is not Bitcoin, Core can do whatever they want and if the rest of the network doesn't agree than they can run their own clients and sideline Core. The hard-forkers did this with Classic and XT and nobody gave a fuck and ignored them.

You have to be extremely naive to believe they will deliver anything with ETH 2.0, if at all. Everyone told them from the beginning that their approach was a dead end, that didn't stop them from telling everyone that they'll run the whole internet on Ethereum
They're just cycling back to the beginning of their scam and doing it again.

Bcash has not fixed tx malleability, only certain cases of it
The current lightning implementations would require significant changes to kind of make it work without segwit, changes that nobody is going to write.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:09:11
wow ok, I see the FUD has been working overtime to confuse people. Your first points are totally irrelevant to address type. Segwit adoption will only grow and be the primary address type, it will be needed if businesses want to build advanced functionality that are not possible by using legacy addresses. Segwit addresses are more secure than legacy and can't be malleated
@_date: 2018-09-24 00:33:52
No they don't, the amount of FUD regarding lighting in r/btc is comical
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:57:17
Good news! LN implementations already do this. If you download ZAP or eclair or lightning lab's LN app, you simply fund the wallet with your BTC and it does the network and channel openings all for you in the background. 
What's the next bullet point in your script?
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:35:14
this is false, lightning does not work on Bcash at all
@_date: 2018-09-12 16:23:17
because it includes a bunch of extremely large transactions with 200 inputs each
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:10:15
no, LN and sidechains are different things
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:35:29
how is it increasingly a pipe dream? every day new developments bring it closer to reality. Your description of how LN works is seriously misinformed, at no point is your money moved off the blockchain nor does it require you to pay to get it back
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:38:54
LN succeeding is a pretty fatal blow to the forkers' narrative, they've worked themselves into a corner with their misinformation

miners don't need any fork to build smaller blocks, they can build empty\small blocks now
@_date: 2017-02-17 17:14:26
No because PoS isn't real
@_date: 2017-02-07 21:35:00
a hard fork is a change in the consensus rules that decides whether blocks are valid or not, meaning all new blocks after the fork will be seen as invalid by ALL current Bitcoin software. The only way to get back on the chain is to upgrade your client to support the new rules.
@_date: 2017-02-08 02:38:36
lol wut? if you accept an invalid block then you are not running Bitcoin, it's as simple as that.
@_date: 2017-02-01 20:22:19

seeing the whole Ethereum community pivot around this whole private chain nonsense is hilarious, they went from  "DECENTRALIZE EVERYTHING!1!11 soon all toasters and websites will be linked together and run on a giant world computer!" to fanboying about trickle down development and how all these private chains will wash down and bless the public network with developers and goodies! same thing.

what are you talking about? if I run a full-node what am I trusting miners with?
@_date: 2017-02-23 19:08:02
they could have had all the hashrate build on it and it would have still been rejected by the network
@_date: 2017-02-28 20:35:41


The problem with Bitcoin is that the end-user functionality and features of the system are fundamentally linked to its technical implementation. Instagram isn't critically dependent on the technical implementation, you can rewrite the whole backend and still have the same features, you can also add new features without having to redesign the whole thing.
Something like that is much harder to do with Bitcoin..so we end up with the equivalent of the 16-year Instagram end-user arguing with experts and developers about the technical design of the system.
@_date: 2017-02-14 01:15:37
You opt-out by not upgrading your client and everyone gets to stay on the same chain, it's not complicated.
@_date: 2017-02-11 21:53:50
Yes it's safe, they were bought out by Kraken
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:39:32
lol you idiots are the one throwing around satoshi's name at every opportunity so who is twisting who's words? You only perceive the core team as toxic because you are literally too stupid to understand the technical issues behind scaling.
@_date: 2017-02-22 16:37:18
is there any doubt now that BU is just an attack on Bitcoin? they will do anything to deceive the ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-02-11 05:34:32
How can one block contain 10k transactions? Most I've ever seen is around 2600-2900
@_date: 2017-02-13 23:42:48
Do you know what a softfork is? You opt out by continuing what you're doing and not using the new features. Hard forks kick people who don't agree off the network.
@_date: 2017-02-28 20:44:29

@_date: 2017-03-26 16:17:51
It allows bigger miners to push through bigger blocks on the network, slowly raising it until smaller miners can no longer handle them eventually creating a big boys club of miners. They can then use their ability to change block size to control the market and profits, raising and lowering fees like central banks
@_date: 2017-03-30 02:13:28
If the majority of the economic nodes switch on the USAF then the miners will have to follow or else they are losing profits. There is nothing extremist about a flag day activation, if the miners won't reach 95% then what other options are there?
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:58:27
The block can be marked to signal support
That's why people say miners don't vote, they only signal. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:17:13
you're not getting what I said, I'm talking about the protocol itself. Bitcoin is restricted in HOW you can implement those features because they need to be added while still remaining compatible with the current network and not risk affecting Bitcoin properties like decentralization, security, etc. Just look at the scaling debate and the difficulty with the block size, even a small change is dangerous and can split the network.

what are you talking about dude? you know that people have to work for a living right? the average open source developer is usually employed in the same field or paid directly by some company to contribute, go look at the corporations that the core linux developers work for.

do you know where you are right now?
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:32:56
it's impossible without extremely large block sizes. Even blocks in the hundreds of megabytes would not be big enough to have everything we need on-chain. 2-layer networks use real Bitcoin txs and scale to more than 1000x while still maintaining security decentralization
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:15:02
more bullshit from vitalik, soft fork's suddenly became "dangerous" when they found out Ethereum can't soft fork at all
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:03:49
There is nothing a miner can do to force users to remain on a chain or to accept any work that that miner offers. They can have all the hash power but any user can trivially ignore anything those miners do, if enough users do it you can wipe out a miner's work. Miners need to attack AND maintain that attack to stop a chain from growing, non-miners don't need to put in all this effort because they have nukes.
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:33:33
So where is the BU roadmap for everything else then? Do they know how to fix trans malleability? Nope. Can they implement schorr's signature? Nope. Do they have any experience working with LN? Nope
@_date: 2017-03-31 18:32:21
Ethereum can't even keep their testnet online and their scaling issues are much much worse than Bitcoin's..
@_date: 2017-03-27 22:24:34

@_date: 2017-03-23 06:27:37
this is a team without any legit cryptocurrency experience, they weren't active developers or contributed anything to Bitcoin or even altcoins...

Why have block size of unlimited bytes ...when we can have 1 MILLION BYTES
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:35:44
Their position is untenable, the entire ecosystem is waiting on them. The signaling mechanism for activation in Bitcoin was a vote of confidence from the core developers to miners because it's the safest way to activate but if they abuse it we'll just go ahead and activate it ourselves.
@_date: 2017-03-27 22:37:43
They are attempting to strongarm the economy to move to an altcoin, I would call that an attack
@_date: 2017-03-23 18:05:06

@_date: 2017-03-27 20:07:28
no altcoins

You don't know what anything you're saying or linking to means
@_date: 2017-03-31 18:41:13
miners can't already do anything but order transactions. The blocks are validated by clients nodes. Handing miners the ability to coordinate block size for the entire network is a complete no go. I'm not interested in having miners turn the blocksize into their own banking rate to can adjust for their benefit only
@_date: 2017-03-27 22:35:15
Let them fork their worthless altcoin. If they attack the Bitcoin chain then they can deal with the lawsuits
@_date: 2017-03-28 05:24:39
Lol so you want to force them to use altcoins?
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:34:53
Literally you are lying. We've been at this for months, everyone has read what they've said about segwit and LN and everything else that's not BU
@_date: 2017-03-26 22:34:27
I don't think we can say anything for sure until this is resolved
@_date: 2017-03-29 20:11:48
so what happens when miners aren't in consensus with the users? how do you force them to come along with you? how do you get rewarded for building a useless blockchain ?
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:42:23
lol you guys were calling segwit "vaporware" even up to the point where it was released but not yet signaling so it's safe to say that flexible transactions is solidly in the vaporware category (as well as being an inferior solution, buggy and doesn't actually work)

well you're just arguing religion and on your belief in something you can't show.
But even if you do go the religion route you still lose. I'll take Blockstream making big profits over Bitcoin being controlled by the Chinese govt. The miners are all for-profit corps controlled by a handful of people in China..which means complete control over them by their government. Clearly this hard fork is a Chinese cyber attack assisted by Western collaborators.
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:39:02
miners aren't supposed to mine on top of anything they consider invalid so it will always hold. The risk with being in the minority hashrate is that you can get split off the network if the rest continue building on what you would see as an invalid block.
@_date: 2017-03-31 16:17:24
segwit is a block size increase with critical fixes and features that allow for multi-layer scaling.

How is it uneccesarry? Downloading the blocks takes a constant connection to the internet and the ability to download gigabytes of data on a constant basis..people in remote or poor areas might have internet access but not the resources to handle the data, what are they gonna do?..download the blocks over their mobile connection? The satellites wipe out that entire cost, you get free and consistent access to the blockchain with no bandwidth or internet costs. They can then use any internet connection no matter how poor it is to broadcast their txs since those are a only a few kbs, you can even do it over SMS

lol what's funny is they were still calling segwit vaporware even after 0.13 was released
@_date: 2016-12-13 07:22:38
What you're talking about is irrelevant. Bitcoin is public and permissionless, it doesn't enforce where and how transactions are made nor can you stop these systems from existing. You can design a system that exchanges transactions by giving it to a man on donkey to deliver it..it changes nothing about Bitcoin itself, as long as the transaction is a valid Bitcoin transaction then it will be accepted by the network.

You're an idiot. Nobody ever denied that this occurred, in fact it's always been used as a warning against validation-less mining.

They have the patent and the hardware for it. Jihan himself said they can do it and be very profitable but don't for the good of the Community.

FACT this covert method is incompatible with many future enhancements, allowing it to continue means blocking actual optimizations

One good thing about this is miners who haven't activated segwit and were unaware of this exploit will now have another reason to upgrade to Segwit otherwise they let the offending miner keep benefiting

This guy mines empty blocks because that's the freedom Bitcoin allows him but he's not using a 30% "optimization" that he has a patent on and has implemented in his hardware for the sake of the whole community, give me a fucking break.
The worst part is this means nothing because the people supporting him don't care.

stop him from what? all he can do at this point is keep blocking segwit activation by not signaling, but that can be taken care of with UASF. We have the miners and nodes to push it through. Jihan doesn't have enough power to make his chain beat out the Bitcoin chain, nobody will follow him.
@_date: 2017-04-06 21:39:43

so good to see your genuine concern, that investor money being wasted must keep you up all night.
@_date: 2017-04-09 02:19:33
Extension Blocks are a compromise against the miners' opposition to Segwit. It's unacceptable that we should keep offering alternatives until miners approve. Anything besides Segwit means handing veto power to Jihan over the future of Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-04-06 06:12:09
So you guys are doubling down huh?
@_date: 2017-04-13 22:10:24
I'm not sure if you're incredibly confused or trolling. Miners don't mine worthless coins, so they certainly don't go first unless you're talking about premined scam coins.

@_date: 2017-04-13 19:18:56
segwit has been blocked since late last year, not 2 years.
also note that the soft fork activation system that requires 95% miner signalling was implemented by Core as it is the safest way to activate a fork, don't mistake this as meaning miners have the power. Users have never followed miners to a coin, miners ALWAYS follow

@_date: 2017-04-14 07:17:08
That's because you don't understand the true cost of a transaction. The effect on the UTXO alone would be disastrous if we don't discourage spam 
@_date: 2017-04-18 19:32:56
with the large pools like Bitfury and F2pool onboard, the risks with a UASF get smaller and smaller. A UASF is easy if Jihan is the only one blocking it, regardless of his hashpower.
@_date: 2017-04-11 22:29:25
This is why I'm so confused by all this fear around USAF. What other choice do we have? Let Jihan set the precedence for Bitcoin upgrades? The ability for users to resist oppression is the fundamental reason Bitcoin works.

I can't figure out what he even means here 
@_date: 2017-04-13 19:55:24
that's not true, Bitcoin never had an upgrade mechanism when created, Satoshi would just release clients with soft fork logic and it would be activated via UASF flag day. The current mechanism is the result of BIP9, a creation of Core Devs

@_date: 2016-09-12 19:42:35
how many transactions/sec can this support?
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:35:18
yes because covert asicboost was patent encumbered, blocked segwit and harmed the network by creating near empty blocks even when thousands of txs were waiting to be mined.

@_date: 2018-11-13 07:07:20
Hashing relies on a one way function whose input always maps to the same random output and its steps can't be reversed to go back to the the original input, the strength lies in the fact that the range of outputs is so overwhelmingly large that you'd barely make a dent into it no matter how much processing capacity we achieve
This is a great short video to explain it better

There are benefits to ASICs, it means the miners are dedicated to the coin and can't flip flop with depending on what's more profitable that day.. at the same time it gives the community a nuclear option, if miners start getting overly hostile we have a great way to wipe them out financially in an instant.. we'll see how far these miners are willing to follow Jihan

the consensus rules are still the same, every block and transaction today is still 100% valid under the same rules from the day Bitcoin launched, older clients crash because they can't handle the amount of transactions and the size of the blocks, it has nothing to do with consensus or block validity

I'm amazed people still believe users give one fuck about hashrate. Look at Bcash..this is a coin that was created, developed and actively promoted by Jihan Wu and his mining cartel..so why isn't it the dominant chain? Why can't Jihan, with the immense hashpower under his control unable to move everyone over to his chain? Is it because users won't pay for his dumpster fire of a chain? is it because even he can't afford to mine it full time at a loss?
They can talk about hashing power all they want, no amount of supply will force demand of a worthless product.

ok well they already buy hundreds of fake BU nodes as we saw from the catastrophic crashes they've suffered, a good chunk went down and came back at the exact same time.
You can keep going on about only miners mattering and that's fine, miners can't impose anything on me. The network can fire them at any time and there is nothing they can do to make us stop or accept their blocks.

Segwit will improve Bitcoin to make it more efficient, more secure and open the door to new features not currently possible.

@_date: 2017-06-09 20:14:29
I wasn't yapping about anything, second of all..it obviously does matter to anybody with sense
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:03:23
They can do whatever the fuck they want, their plan will 100% fail. They can have all the hashpower they want but they're dreaming of they think the market will pay anything for their worthless coins
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:54:03
ask them what? Maxwell authored the Bitcoin Core scaling roadmap and it contains hard forks as a future path when everything is in place
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:21:48
lol I almost forgot about this clown show, who is even advocating for BU anymore?
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:59:32
Please please do this, Bitmain hard forking will guarantee victory for bip148
@_date: 2017-06-02 18:20:00
Geth also has automatic software updates, imagine when that shit show blows up
@_date: 2017-06-30 17:24:32
He has no ideas you trolling moron. His talk is just him standing there swearing yet you complain about ad hominem attacks lol
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:34:53
They didn't hard fork but you don't know the difference so I won't bother
@_date: 2017-06-17 15:52:03
lol not sure if you've been paying attention but segwit is coming Aug 1st
@_date: 2017-06-28 19:14:19
TIL snake oil is a killer app
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:10:48
except these coins are not connected to their respective companies in any meaningful way
@_date: 2017-06-17 20:32:39
With Segwit we will be able to add in new and better signatures
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:07:32
Compact blocks have already been deployed in Bitcoin Core
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:24:41
Bitcoin doesn't care, it's going to eat everything these guys throw at it. They so badly want it to fall on itself
@_date: 2018-12-23 20:07:54
There are over 100000 Bitcoin nodes
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:58:06
The cool thing about the deadlines is there is no need to argue about anything, just sit back and wait until August 1st to see why you're wrong.
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:01:24
Well if Bitmain wants to get into a Bitcoin cyberwarfare with the rest of the Bitcoin community I would say get out your popcorn and enjoy
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:12:51
It offers nothing. All those things are possible because of Segwit.
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:02:58
Segwit usage will rise as more people will want to take advantage of lower fees and make use of 2nd layer applications. Right now fees in general are low and 2nd layer apps are only just starting to take off, the need to upgrade isn't a pressing issue yet for everyone
@_date: 2017-06-24 16:55:22
No, they use different algorithms. Im guessing you'd have to calculate how much money you need to buy enough GPUs to match ETH vs how much you need to buy Bitcoin ASICs..there's probably other stuff you'd have to account for as well

I just went through this exact process. Laying in the living room when I get an email and SMS on my phone saying my 2fa has been changed.
I ran to my computer in a panic. Logged in and nothing was changed, no other account access..but I still changed my coinbase and email passwords and deauthorized all other devices. What a shit show, my head was spinning the entire time. 
edit: even though i have little btc on Coinbase, the thought that someone bypassed my passwords, emails and 2fa was the real scare 
@_date: 2017-06-06 01:25:22
Samourai wallet for sure, they also have a watch only version called Sentinel. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:35:52
What's crazy is Ethereum is falling on it's face as usual any time it gets any bit of stress use. You have this "global super computer" grinding to a halt when these big ICO sales occur, not to mention how quickly they started getting high tx fees
Their plan for PoS is clearly not happening anytime soon..they're gonna delay and hype as much as they can before the real fireworks start.. I have my popcorn ready lol
@_date: 2017-06-30 17:10:54
I remember reading that Wright had team of mysterious investors behind him when this whole hoax was launched, how likely is it that Ver and Bitmain are actually the guys behind it? I can't think of any other deep pockets who fell for this bullshit.
@_date: 2017-06-30 20:49:00
btc1 Core 1.14.3? what a joke
@_date: 2017-06-04 17:19:34
Do yourself a favour and don't worry about these clowns. You should never have to worry about what someone like McAfee thinks or does in the Bitcoin space.
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:03:16
Not going to calm down, going to celebrate instead. BIP148 is going full steam ahead now
@_date: 2016-05-13 15:27:23
@_date: 2017-06-24 16:52:10
Do people know that ICO coins don't give them a share of the actual company?
@_date: 2017-06-10 07:18:54
Everything you said is bullshit.
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:01:15
The devs from all the main implementations got together a few weeks ago and put together the accepted proposals for the upcoming version 1.1 of the LN protocol. You can read the updates that are coming here:
 
@_date: 2017-06-22 20:31:18
gonna call bullshit on this
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:16:26
It seems there is an intentional attempt to try and link Bitcoin's creation with these scam ICOs that are popping up. Roger even wrote this on the segwit2x mailing list:


Treating Bitcoin as an "ICO launch" by satoshi is completely false, my guess is Roger is tied up in many of these ICO scams and this is his way to give them an air of legitimacy.

If it's not hardware specifically for sha2 hashing then it's literally worthless as a Bitcoin miner
edit: think millions of times too slow
@_date: 2018-12-09 00:30:34
It's not just the storage space, it's also the amount of network traffic, even with 1mb my node was sending over 1TB of data per months serving txs and blocks to other nodes
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:38:13
what is this referring to?
@_date: 2017-06-26 12:56:19
It's at 0% signaling
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:55:36
and what about the UTXO set?
@_date: 2017-06-17 19:02:45
it doesn't matter, they are just saving face. segwit2x proposal now activates segwit and hardfork seperately, so we will get segwit and hard fork will still have to be agreed by everybody when the time comes, they can't bundle the hard fork with segwit at the same time
@_date: 2016-07-03 17:53:45
Hah I had this playlist saved already 
Thanks again
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:54:14
I didn't believe it when I started reading the blog post this morning, how could have Bitmain possibly thought what they announced was a good idea? 
@_date: 2016-07-30 16:22:11
i don't understand why nullc is always there arguing with those idiots. Literally the biggest group of ignorant morons in the community
@_date: 2017-06-08 05:24:40
i put a bit on exchanges to sell legacy coins in case of split
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:28:39
it had a planned hardfork early on to add new stuff, then it had the bailout hard fork and then 2 more hard forks when the network was crippled by DoS attacks.
@_date: 2017-06-17 16:03:29
I'm ok with Core not merging a bip148 flag. This whole movement has been user-driven from the start and is well on its way to success. It's a great counter to the bullshit narrative the other guys have spun the last few years about Core controlling Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:15:20
can you explain how you got scammed?
