How is blockchain.info pro-BCH?
When I look at the front page of blockchain.info, everything is BTC BTC, while BCH is nowhere to be seen.

WOW. The hacker now has your Gmail password.  YOU NEED TO CHANGE YOUR GMAIL PASSWORD NOW.

Bitstamp is a UK firm, and considered to be an offshore financial account by the IRS.
So US citizens will have to file FBAR forms (balance $10,000+) and FATCA forms (balance $50,000+) every year.

Check your gmail trash folder.  The other phishing scam victim said he found the transfer confirmation email in his gmail trash folder (the scammer intercepted it, then deleted it)
Either way, I highly recommend that you change your gmail password, just in case the hacker has your old gmail password.

It says United Kingdom in the IRS/FATCA database, and it says United Kingdom at the bottom of the Bitstamp.net website.
 
Bitstamp Ltd  
5 New Street Square, London EC4A 3TW  
United Kingdom  
 
But it doesn't really matter if they're in UK or Luxembourg or Brazil.  If they're outside the US, then FBAR &amp; FATCA rules apply.

Yeah, the wording seems rather ghetto &amp; crass.
Private client / private banking ads for HNWIs tend to focus more on inspiration &amp; self-actualization &amp; legacy.  Example:

Nope. 
Cobra has been gradually moving towards Bitcoin Cash, and has been going through the five stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance).

Now, Cobra has reached the fifth and final stage: **ACCEPTANCE**.

LOL. Get a grip.

Plenty of private client &amp; private banking ads in the Wall Street Journal.
