Awww, Awesome! Thanks **alot**!
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:29:41
Thank you. I agree
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:15:55
Hahaha why not
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:24:38
Yeah. Don't worry, I will invest. But if I can double my profit by waiting.. :P
Thanks for the advice.
Oh and, I could use that 250 simply to cover food expenses for a couple months.
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:50:32
No Bitstamp is working for me. ;)
@_date: 2013-04-29 17:19:56
In this context, **FTFY** would mean *Fuck That, Fuck You*, Am I Right?

Bitcoin is stong and in my opinion trustworthy. It is inevitable that it's value will rise if people like me keep on believing in it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:53:49
Roughly 0.035BTC/day. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:40:27
I'll think about it. Thanks.
EDIT: As long as I keep my GPU at a suitable temp. I'm pretty free of harm. I have installed temperature warnings and auto-shutdown triggers. My current GPU temp. is 63 deg. Celsius.

I just bought 1BTC. I don't believe bitcoin is a bubble
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:23:41
I bought at 96$..........
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:02:08
Who said it didn't make sense? I told you to be polite.
@_date: 2013-04-29 18:22:44
It all begins with an


Anyways, I do agree with the fact that it may annoy them, so the ideal solution would be: a 5$ tip *+ some BTC*
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:10:35
No risk. The website clearly says it's under beta testing.
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:13:52
Found another problem ;)
I can't create an account with an md5 hashed password. Oops!
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:50:21
Bitstamp. 
@_date: 2013-04-29 17:58:15
That, is what is yet to be developed and improved.
@_date: 2013-06-25 13:43:33
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:36:00
[Bitstamp] ( is UK-Based
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:17:59
I'm in, you bet. I'll just wait on a bit more advice from other people if I can get some.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:04:16
^ all my specs &amp; mining info are in the selfpost (edit) ;) - Oh and I use GUIMiner.
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:02:22
I believe in Bitcoin. Which is why I'm buying. Bitcoin is truly the currency of the tech generation.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:36:35
Probably. But I'm contributing to the system.
@_date: 2013-04-18 07:00:28
Don't fucking force a company to accept a currency. **Use your brain.**
@_date: 2013-04-18 06:54:13
*cough*  Bitstamp  *cough*
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:59:40
* my 0.02BTC ;)
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:05:55
The opinion of someone who [apparently] ( says faggot every two comments is of no value at all to me.
@_date: 2013-04-18 07:37:10
Thinking the same exact thing.
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:10:03
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:59:30
Pretty damn harsh, don't you think?
Even if your opinion is comprehensible: speak correctly, or GTFO.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:55:32
Chill bro. I will invest.
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:40:41
When is the challenge over? :)
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:19:18
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:49:33
Can't wait for LTC :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:38:27
Not yet hah. But I don't think it's too much to worry about
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:39:42
I'll try. Thanks
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:22:16
Add a verify behind that ;)
EDIT: Cancelled. People like you don't belong here.
@_date: 2013-04-29 17:21:27
Wrong, Bitcoin is an international currency aimed to be acceted in all countries as *it doesn't belong to a country*
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:17:17
What the frick are you trying to do now avatarr? :P

No, it's creative commons licensed, BUT it might be reserved for commerical rights. [Link](
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:43:02
+bitcointip  1$ verify
I totally agree.
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:04:00
We love you and Bitcoin, sir. Thanks for believing in BTC too
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:01:15
How beautiful
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:55:59
I'll have a go :)
 Eh?
@_date: 2013-04-16 06:10:38
I feel very screwed right now (65$) haha. But it *will* go up.
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:52:08
Buy, transfer to Bitstamp, wait a few mins, sell for a bit more.
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:18:12
Haha tell me
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:43:48
What? No haha. I love Canada! *It's like the US, without the bad things.*
By the way: I submitted a quite important exploit to hello
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:22:44
All hashers are the same (result-wise), but I never use online hashers, that way it's not in the system.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:07:07
Ouch yes. Thats dangerous. My current temperature is (only) 63 deg. Celsius
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:40:31
Cool! (Make it rain? :D)
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:07:49
It's smart.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:45:41


Now you see my dilemma
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:27:54
I just purchased at 96$. I'm betting on it stabilizing at 150$
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:47:01
Haha. Yay!
I'm liking the interface already :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:11:58
I sometimes use one, sometimes the other. Being new, I don't know which is the most profitable (yet) :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:15:20
Incredibly, it's just a (semi-complicated) setup away from mining (-&gt; income). It does slow down your graphics rendering *alot* though, which makes your computer quite limited. You can still browse Reddit, but playing video games is out of question.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:45:01
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:36:10
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:02:37
Haha. Hilarious

@_date: 2013-04-11 00:16:43
I'm seeing loads of comments but no upvotes. Please take the effort to upvote this post so more people can ask me questions. I'll be up all night for you guys ;)
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:22:07
Haha. Good one.
Look's like destiny is allowing people who "missed the bitcoin train" to catch up.
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:45:16
Not Bitstamp.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:30:05
Great! Can I keep the play money? :D
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:56:06
What 


??? CloudFlare has **nothing** to do with *Centralization*
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:39:24
Hello! I'm currently getting 307Mhash/s. I know I can do better. I just don't know how.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:30:30
What an adventure! 
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:35:00
I'm happy with that :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:55:13
Yeah, the most important part is good cooling. And if you're happy with 100, then it can still be profitable on a good pool.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:15:52
I came to this subreddit for advice. I know some people here know more about the market and BTC in general than I do. I would appreciate if you kept your opinion for yourself if it's not constructive. I don't think you realize what position I'm in. I do apologize for not interesting you..
I appreciate your feedback anyways, but I will not be taking it into consideration. Thanks
@_date: 2013-04-13 08:42:20
Yeah.. I'm not going to be trusting them with my money.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:21:06
I'm terribly annoyed by the fact that you consider my post like some kind of spam. I would like to express the fact that investing into something you believe in when you're only a student, and you've already got fuckloads of student debt up your ass to risk it all like that.
Oh and 2ndplace: pop a 'verify' behind that tip, and I'll believe you ;) (EDIT: Oh gee, you cancelled it. What a surprise.)
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:08:45
It's fluctuating. And still, 93$ is ridiculously cheap
@_date: 2013-04-29 17:57:28
If you consider it that way, *why are you here?*
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:44:43
haha.. I will.
