this would still not work for a US check going into a NZ bank, maybe it would save me waiting in line, but not the 6 weeks to clear.

NZ is a bit behind there, and no matter what I could do to scan, etc a US check takes 6 weeks to clear at my bank.

My Mom can't even use a Mac much less comprehend what bitcoin is.

Was there even a point?  What did you get, like 50 cents worth of Bitcoin?

Did they care when the internet was invented?  "Writing letters and going to the post office is just fine for me", "opening the dictionary is no big deal to me", "pulling the car over and navigating by fold out map is just fine by me" "I have a set of encyclopedias, why would I need anything else?".  As far as Paypal being "just fine", well I am a small business owner and it's far from fine.  I would save well over $500 a month in transaction fees if Bitcoin was the standard means of online transactions.  That is a BIG deal to small biz owners AND the local economy.  Imagine me with an extra $500 a month to spend around town (or I could reduce fees to customers as well).  Not to mention Paypal has a habit of making strange threats and even putting a hold on YOUR money, etc.

At the rate things are going it shouldn't be much longer.  I would try to be active in starting a chapter but my plate is way too full right now.  I'm thinking of heading to Queenstown for the conf though.

Bitcoin is growing exponentially, and so is my excitement.  Just the mere notion of all these centralized payment cartel sonsofbitches being laid to waste makes me absolutely freaking giddy.  I want to see them squirm, suffocate, wither and die.  Couldn't happen to a nicer bunch of pricks.
