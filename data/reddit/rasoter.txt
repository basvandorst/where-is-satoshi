Thanks for the time, it was a good read!

So, a company should accept bitcoins for that 10% of people? And who are those people? Why they can't use fiat currency? 
@_date: 2017-09-23 13:45:49
Ahahah, implementing a new "currency" in a business is a little more complicated than you think.
Imagine having a company that operates in the US and accepts on only $. Do you think it's going to be easy to start accepting also ¥? Just think about all the problems regarding tax, conversion of the money, accountability, etc etc. Now, try to imagine the same, but instead of ¥ you have BTC.

The fact that in the future is going to be inevitable is quite questionable. However, we are not talking about the future, but the present. Why, right now, a company should spend money to change its own infrastructure in order to start accepting bitcoins?

Where's my money?

Why is it convenient to pay with partners?

VISA charge Banks to use their circuit; Banks shift the cost (plus another fee) on their customers.

Here, you're so lucky, it's 70$, when I bought it was 110$!
If you want me to give more up-to-date sources, send me a pm, but it's going to cost you some $ or BTC. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 10:13:01
I guess your foreign partners don't get only $5, am I right? :) 
With fiat currency the bank is going to do the administrative work (reporting to Tax authorities etc etc).
With BTC, there's no bank, so the company has to do all the administrative work, and that's gonna cost money.
How much do you spend (time or money) in administrative work for each BTC transaction? 
@_date: 2017-09-23 08:35:00
Companies don't believe in causes. They want you to belive that, but if there's no profit for them, I assure you they aren't going to invest. A company is not a no profit entity.

The merchant always pay a fee for each VISA transaction. They change from State to State. 
For example, in some countries, the merchant has to pay a monthly fee to have a POS in the store. Moreover, each time the customer pays with a credit card, the merchant has to pay a little amount of his earnings in fees.

I don't think, switching to bitcoins will solve the problem of VISA' fees. 
In the real world, no clients are using (and only a small part owns) bitcoins. So, said company will still need to guarantee electronic payments (i.e. Visa) even if it decides to switch to bitcoins. Otherwise, nobody will buy from them.
It seems to me that, right now, switching to bitcoins won't free the company from Visa transaction fees, until a large part of the clients will start using (or at least owning) bitcoins.

Aside from the fact that what you posted is a chapter of a whole book, you should read it, before saying that it doesn't support a claim.
"The Bitcoin Foundation surveyed prominent Bitcoin participants about different hy-
potheticals that could affect the Bitcoin ecosystem [16]. While they did not explicitly
ask about Bitcoin scams, they found that mismanaged Bitcoin businesses was a top
threat to Bitcoin’s success. They also found people feared Bitcoin getting a “bad rep-
utation” for being a haven for wicked behavior. This includes a concern over Bitcoin
being used for gambling (e.g., many Bitcoin-only HYIPs). The scams presented in this
paper doubtless could harm Bitcoin’s reputation if they are not eradicated".
If you read the other chapters, you will find that it addresses also the reputational issue arising from Silkroad shutdown.
So, are you going to pay my bucks for the research? :)

Sorry, I don't usually make things up. Please, find below one of the many sources about the marketing value (i.e. reputation among the public) of the crypto currencies.

For a company it's not really easy, and quite expensive, to accept a new type of currency. Think about the infrastructure investment needed. Even explaining to your employees what is bitcoin will need training courses, which are expensive.
So, said company is going to ask, why should I make an investment, spend time and money, just to accept bitcoins? Isn't fiat currency good enough? 
@_date: 2017-09-23 10:21:00
Marketing value is really low, even negative in some countries.
BTC, sadly, is usually associated with dealing drugs, weapons and prostitution. Thanks the media for that.
So, a company that's gonna say "hey guys, you can also pay me in BTC!" is gonna arouse a lot of suspicion, especially among people who aren't really tech savvy. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 09:02:11
Yes, it is rendered invalid.
To accept bitcoins, a company has to invest to change its own infrastructure (I'm talking about a company, not small shop that sells bagels with one employee). So, that investment has to get a return, a profit. 
If I have to stick to VISA, because the majority of people don't have bitcoins (the whole net worth of all the crypto currencies is 41 billions $, the global net worth of physical money in 2015 is 31 trillions $), it means that my earnings from not having VISA fees are gonna be really low, and they won't justify the investment made to accept bitcoins.

Let me ask, avoiding the foreign exchange control of the bank via BTC isn't illegal in your country? I guess the bank has to check where the money are going and then report to your Tax authority (i.e. In Europe, every bank has to check abroad payments to assure that money aren't going to fund terrorism, or stuff like that, and report to the Tax authority).
Without the bank checking on your transactions, do you have to directly report said payments to the Tax authority of your country? If that's the case, how do you deal with the paper work and consequent administrative costs? 
@_date: 2017-09-23 10:27:33
How many are using BTC right now? I mean, what's the % worldwide confronted with other electronic payments methods? 
@_date: 2017-09-23 10:24:52
Cool! 
Can you provide a model of the form that you use to report the transactions to your Tax authority? (no worries, it doesn't need to be in English, it can be in any language) 
@_date: 2017-09-23 19:55:42
So, when are you going to pay me? 
@_date: 2017-09-23 08:22:40
Visa fees 
@_date: 2017-09-23 10:08:24
Look, I don't want to be right. I'm here because I have questions. So bear with me if I'm being the devil advocate, I have no bad will.
Back on the issue. 
About costs, let say the company is medium/small size, has ten shops and 20 cashiers. I'll need to train the cashiers about what is bitcoin. Also, I'll need to invest on my accountability system, to track bitcoins transactions. Also, I'll need to continuously check the change $/BTC, to adeguate the prices of the goods I'm selling. Moreover, there's no bank keeping safe my BTC, so I'll need to spend money trying to secure my BTC, thats because if they are stolen, there's no bank that's gonna be liable. 
That's a $$$ investment for the company.
