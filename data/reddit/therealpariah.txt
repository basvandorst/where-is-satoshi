*yawn*, I'm uninterested in this facile, historically ignorant defense of the status quo. Instead, I'll turn this around and do the exact same thing you're doing.
the "state should regulate" argument doesn't fly. following that logic, countries could make it illegal to use certain public facilities, make it illegal for certain businesses to transact with certain minorities, and to force certain minorities to only own businesses in shitty parts of towns... all the while forcing those minorities to pay for their own oppression.
cold blooded man

but enforcement *how*? "Regulation" against poor quality food can be enforced by consumers who refuse to purchase it. The conduct of the food sellers is "regulated" in this way.


third party means a party outside the ones in the transaction. 


And if you think that is the state or its regulators, you're delusional. Hah, I actually laughed when I read that. Interesting perspective indeed.

Right, the drug market is all but a strangled, dry husk... wait a tic.

you're adorable. It's funny because you're a caricature who thinks he is ridiculing others for being a caricature. Look at you try so hard! :D

Keep dancing kiddo, we're performing for a bunch of meta subReddits. It's time to play your part! The show must go on.

you're not smart enough for this conversation
@_date: 2014-07-18 17:12:13
Let me tell you how this looks to me from my perspective:
A man comes up to you and proposes he is going to punch you in the nose, but would allow suggestions to changes to the proposal. Now, you understand that any suggested change must still include having some sort of violence done to you.
What's my solution? Don't do violence to me. I don't know how practical that solution is either, but suggesting changes, all of which includes violence against me and also submits to the staked-out authority of this scumbag is untenable.
Bitcoin users are smart enough to propose solutions and the solution is for Bitcoin to operate without forced control.

Great! You can deal with companies which offer those safeguards you value. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 17:56:41
after all, thinking is hard and can be uncomfortable. Lucky for me, the comment is more for others than to convince you of anything.

Well, no, they're not. Perhaps the alleged intent of them is "good" (at least when stripped of the costs). They all have benefits and costs, but that doesn't mean they're all good things. The elimination of privacy in financial transactions and forcing consumers to dangerously expose themselves certainly meets government interests (stop money transactions government doesn't like, taxes, etc.), but it doesn't seem to be what consumers actually want.
Maybe you value the elimination of privacy in financial markets, and the great thing about bitcoin currently is you can transact with and through companies which meet that demand... and you can do it without forcing others to do things they don't want and you can do it without forcing a third party bureaucrat with their own interests into the discussion.
Regulations can be good and safeguards can be good, but they're rarely (if ever) good when imposed by a third party with little or no competition which eliminates consumer and producer choice. Just because you think something is a "good idea" doesn't mean you accurately account the costs of that idea or whether consumers are willing to pay that cost. Assessing these costs and benefits is a lot more complicated than a do-gooder running a bulldozer through a china shop because he thinks it sounds pretty good and *he doesn't have to pay for it.*

I like regulation, but regulation by a third party entity which forces all to obey is not the only regulation. In fact, it's a good environment to craft *terrible and costly* regulations where the interests of the regulator displace all others.

Holding, I'll keep my bitcoin purely as a middle finger extending towards the world. I'd rather have this than some new consumer shit that will break.

The U.S. literally, forcefully, opened up the *extremely* isolationist Japan at the end of a cannon and someone actually said something so absurd as "you'd be paying Japanese taxes right now."
Besides, even if true, why does it really matter if I pay American taxes or Japanese taxes. Why does it matter so much that I would be willing to sacrifice my life or my property to prevent it? Nationalism is such an infectious, dangerous mental delusion.

What is the contradiction?
@_date: 2013-03-18 15:57:23
If they accept the food and shelter their slave owner gives them, yes apparently. This dude's rationalization is essentially, "master has been good to you and you ate his food, so not only should you obey, you should *want* to obey and vanquish any hypocritical thought to the contrary from your mind."
@_date: 2013-03-16 07:57:48
Well, after all, I did tell the thief I would give him my wallet if he didn't shoot me. I'm a hypocrite if I accept his rescission of the threat of violence if I paid him and then refuse to pay him.
@_date: 2013-03-16 08:15:57
Sure, I've heard the typical rationalizations for theft and violence before. I've also heard the typical mischaracterizations and butchering of the term "selfish" or anything resembling non"selfish."


Bravo, I actually smirked after reading this. I wish this was sarcasm, but I know it's probably not. Who would even suggest something so demonstrably nonsense? What would I do if the U.S. government didn't contunously engage in the meddling which served as a catalyst to switch the isolationist Japan into a land seizing empire, including restricting trade with the Japanese while giving militarily support to their opponents? I don't know, I would probably mind my own fucking business.
@_date: 2013-03-16 07:07:29
I "accept" it because if I don't I get thrown in a cage. If there was no threat, I wouldn't "accept" anything. There is no contradiction here. You do not contradict yourself for refusing to pay for something you never voluntarily agreed to in the first place.
The "tax cheat" is the same sort of cheat a victim of theft is when they don't tell the thief they actually have a few dollars in their back pocket when the thief yells, "give me all your money!"
