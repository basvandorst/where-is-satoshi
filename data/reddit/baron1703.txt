@_date: 2019-08-20 11:39:34
I literally laughed out loud
@_date: 2019-08-20 11:44:47

@_date: 2019-10-23 20:00:18
Hey at least its not burned like with unspendable btc addresses, in this case it was merely donated
@_date: 2019-10-08 09:17:36
Thank you.

More threads like this, less memes please
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:52:32
To be fair, that was supposed to be sarcasm.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:02:43
Check @_date: 2017-11-15 06:54:34
I think he is dumber than people give him credit. The numerous 2k sell walls and large market sells coordinated with bcash market buys are just too suspicious in the light of his 25k deposit. I honestly think he is just quite stupid and is going to lose a lot of money on this.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:33:58
Lol. Here you go:
Its pretty obvious from the text as well as the comments that this is sarcasm. Fuck bcash anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:18:44
Fuck you
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:02:07
How is a dumbass like you upvoted here?
@_date: 2019-04-27 05:30:31
This is just not true. They have always been fair to their customers.
@_date: 2019-04-27 05:31:53
Posting this in r/bitcoin .... bold move :D
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:53:34


Actually, rates are rising rapidly in the US and QE is being unwined at 40bn usd per month, but thanks for your narrative.
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:15:27
Bcash is a scam
@_date: 2018-03-24 07:38:21
is the idiot know as bitfinexd. Just ignore him.
@_date: 2018-11-07 13:27:39
Get a lawyer asap? Why are you even wasting time with this on reddit?
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:07:29
Fed balance sheet was inflated bc they were buying: a) treasuries and b) mortgage backed securities.
Standard procedure was that when these securities were repaid, they were "rolled over", i.e. proceeds that they generated were used to buy new securities, thus keeping the balance sheet at a certain size. For several months already, the FED is not rolling over these securities and is thereby lowering its balance sheet. The money goes back to the FED which effectively means it is destroyed.

THIS is Bitcoin scaling.

@_date: 2019-09-25 06:20:31

They seem fine. I skyped on my last flight and the delay was approximately the same as when i skype on the ground (yes, a delay an extra 300ms is perceivable).
@_date: 2018-04-10 08:09:56
Solid fud.
@_date: 2019-09-25 06:19:19
Alex, you retarded shilling cunt, at least register a new account when trying to shill for shitpay. This is shilling 101 bruv.

This is the type of threads you get once you guys decide to give someone that asks this sort of question free btc. (the one in the morning raked in over 20 bucks for asking how he can get 10usd worth)
@_date: 2015-02-11 06:17:43
beta. BETA. Yes brb risking my savings by using unfinished, untested software. Only on bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-25 17:01:31
This is really pathetic. They are going to try to blackmail bitcoinFog so they release the info about who mixed their coins? Fuck bter, this happened due to their own incompetence (or maybe these tweets are just covering up their own theft).
@_date: 2015-02-10 13:52:18
Never heard of this exchange.. hard to believe they had 387 million under management
@_date: 2015-02-19 18:58:15

@_date: 2018-12-12 15:54:20
You fucking clown: you are stealing Trezor's logo, branding, reusing its code and pretending that your shit product is associated with the original. Scam.
@_date: 2015-02-09 18:17:56
Mainly awareness, but in the bigger picture, its not.
@_date: 2018-12-26 08:26:11
How in the world is JBP a flaming cunt?
@_date: 2018-12-12 16:23:03
Fraud is where you are misleading people with the branding "Trezor" and the logo, as well as the UI of your site. You are intentionally (and implicitly implying) that you are associated with the original producer and thereby trying to exploit their excellent reputation to sell your crap product. But you know all this, so why do i bother.
@_date: 2018-12-06 07:52:48
The fed is actually unwinding QE so its destroying dollars.
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:49:48
flibbr is a degenerate that trades according to moon cycles and lost most his coins on gox. 'industry leader' lol, please. he couldnt manipulate himself out of a plastic bag.
@_date: 2018-12-12 12:57:52
Lol what is this fucking scam @_date: 2015-02-26 06:51:10
Yeah, it always looked fishy to me. I would never trust them with my money.
@_date: 2018-12-26 08:25:40
And nobody is stopping us from boycotting a private company that censors speech to further its own leftist agenda.
