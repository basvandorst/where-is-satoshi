Tbh I can see BTC overtaking gold at some point, but idk about getting anywhere near the other ones.  Will still be an outstanding accomplishment if it does.

Sorry, I added 2 extra 2s on accident in my transaction

I think he means if tether fails it could change way people see btc
@_date: 2019-06-06 21:37:03
Oh sorry I thought I was reading up on "Bitcoin Psychology" - whatever that means lmao.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:16:07
Lol touche
@_date: 2019-06-06 16:19:38
Thanks for your insight oh wise one, glad I stumbled upon your post today, now I know exactly what I must do.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:52:05
Tbh even if it was 1 million per btc it wouldnt replace the dollar
@_date: 2019-06-06 16:18:02
Slips into the pockets of the people the banks lobby for anyways
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:50:48
7.1K last year, was sad cause it went down 1k the same day but its paid off to HODL
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:02:58
In 2 years the world wont be that much different than it is now
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:01:28
People won't stop mining even after all of it is mined, and it won't be mined in our lifetime anyways tbh.  You can find a more detailed response if you google it
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:49:58
Pretty much, I'm not selling my btc anyways, just HODLing and checking in on memes whether it goes up or down
@_date: 2019-04-22 17:15:49
Not in our lifetime lol
@_date: 2019-04-06 12:19:37
Great read. I was thinking of studying TA and getting into trading with your mindset. Big risks aren't needed to make money.
@_date: 2019-04-28 03:14:20
Maybe I am, I just want the best for BTC lol
@_date: 2019-04-22 18:50:57
Maybe I will be, but it will be a point in my life where it won't really impact my life much considering I'll be retired
@_date: 2019-04-03 13:51:51
HODL my beer. FTFY
@_date: 2019-04-23 16:48:51
Fair enough my friend.  I hope it becomes reality :)
@_date: 2019-04-03 20:25:02
56,000\* FTFY
@_date: 2019-04-23 03:11:39
Heard that 5 years ago, still not even close
@_date: 2019-04-27 21:35:38
Completely untrue my friend. If BTC gets government love instead of being cockblocked over and over, we'd be getting somewhere much faster.
@_date: 2019-04-04 00:02:12
To be fair the span of time between the rises also increased
@_date: 2019-04-27 21:37:30
Can you name any car besides "lambo"? You uncultured swine
@_date: 2019-04-03 20:23:10
Coinbase pro
@_date: 2019-04-22 17:20:37
Bitcoin pls go to moon. Pls stop go sideways now. Tony vay say we going down to 1k but Mr. Novigratz say we have baaaaatttttomed out. Battomed out. Tony Vay is bearish. Battomed out. Novigratz is bullish. Battomed out~
@_date: 2019-04-04 00:03:35
Its just a meme mate calm down
@_date: 2019-04-04 00:05:00
@_date: 2019-04-03 13:51:22
Too soon
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:24:36
Wow, well said! Bravo

Next big economic crisis, btc will be king
@_date: 2019-05-07 07:30:20
Awesome cartoon
@_date: 2019-05-14 13:49:38
I mean you can ban it all you want, but if you have no way of enforcing it people will still do it.  Just look at the piracy problem, I pirate everything, most people I know pirate everything, and nothing is done about it
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:23:06
@_date: 2019-05-07 07:33:03
You shouldnt be trusting strangers on the internet with anything.
@_date: 2019-05-07 07:45:36
Its already not your problem to be fair. Lul
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:25:46
Keep calm and HODL. Lambo in a few years
@_date: 2019-05-12 20:07:53
Wow this is crazy. Even if it was a scam, you choose what to do with your money. How embarassing for Indian banks right now, scared of competition
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:06:55
Imagine how it will do on the next big global economic crisis.
@_date: 2019-05-12 20:11:45
This is very sad.. Hope that bastard dies soon and lets the people of Venezuela live.
@_date: 2019-05-28 14:39:51
Great read.  Its very hard to explain what you just did in laymans terms, well done.
@_date: 2019-05-12 01:25:37
@_date: 2019-05-28 14:45:44
Thats not satoshi lol, still a great image though. For the memes
@_date: 2019-05-13 05:07:12
@_date: 2019-05-12 20:13:02
Im surprised businesses accept it lol
@_date: 2019-05-09 09:17:37
@_date: 2019-05-12 20:15:01
Think of BTC/ as gold or use for bigger purchases, alt coins as currency for small purchases.  The BTC network isnt the fastest if tons of people are transfering. But at the same time it has and will hold the biggest value/name.  BTC is king, thats how I view crypto
@_date: 2019-05-28 14:43:42
Gotta love how they give in
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:20:19
Nor 7000 coming soon
