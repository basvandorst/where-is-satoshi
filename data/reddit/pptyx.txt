Utterly. I wish someone would post the source (and maybe re-translate it like the Chinese statement not too long ago).

Sure - outreach is important. 
But what I'm more concerned about is the outright ban of cryptocurrencies at a state-sanctioned level. Unless I'm mistaken, this is unprecedented. 
How will they even enforce this? What form of prosecution would be taken? The mind boggles.

Actually, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that functions by means of a public ledger. And that public ledger is the blockchain.

You're probably not familiar with [Paul Mason's]( work then. This is how Mason is, albeit extra animated in this report. He's been one of the most consistently reliable and astute critics of global finance's systemic corruption for some time now. And given that he was one of only a handful who outspokenly predicted the 2008 banking crisis when still at the BBC, it's not so surprising that he's sick of it. In case you're still interested, here's [a good lecture]( he gave based on his book [Why It's Kicking Off Everywhere]( which made a quite a splash in the UK a few years back.

Ah, sorry. I don't visit r/bitcoin that regularly :P
But still, this is way bigger news than Apple or Gox IMO.

Got to love it when The Verge rehashes your reddit post
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:31:34
Agreed. And why I prefer to support Dark Wallet.
@_date: 2014-04-25 13:15:26
Lol. Trouble is already coded into its nature. So what difference will its name make? Besides, why "ought" it play PR games of social acceptability?
@_date: 2014-02-07 23:42:55
What are you citing? The bold isn't from the Coindesk article I posted.

Better: 
go to The Pembury, have a jar and wait for all this to blow over

It's probably better to use fewer specialist terms (like "proof of existence") in an absolute beginner explanation. 
This would be mine to Brand:
Bitcoin is a new form of something very old. It's money that no longer depends on a central authority, like banks or governments. Instead it depends on its use among peers across a network electronically. Like the internet, this network is neither owned nor controlled by a single entity. So anyone can join this network, with the use of a simple device like a smartphone, and replace their bank. Bitcoin, then, is money freed from corruptible legal restrictions, like borders,  taxes, and private deals made by politicians. Instead, it puts incorruptible mathematical laws to work publicly. Bitcoin is the handling of value evolved.

Thanks for sleuthing this out. V. helpful!

I don't see how your analogy applies.
The Russian statement (or at least this translation of it) unambiguously classifies cryptocurrencies in general as **monetary surrogates** -- and bitcoin is directly identified as one. 
Let's look again at what they say about so-called monetary surrogates:


This goes one step further than China, which only went so far as to ban "financial institutions" from dealing with cryptocurrencies: they have disallowed "private citizens" from using them. I understand that to mean individuals.
They give no conditions for bitcoin usage (i.e. whether or not it is used for money laundering purposes). It's a blanket ban on bitcoin for Russian citizens as such.
@_date: 2014-02-07 23:30:57
True. But it's not the economics of the ban that's the issue but the politics. It's the political implications that's worrying.
By what right does a state-apparatus have to ban a crypto-currency? And cryptos aren't "monetary surrogates" in any sense given that they're actively exchanged for fiat.

It's impossible to reply directly without repeating myself as you already have. But maybe I wasn't clear enough in my first reply so I'll go over that again.
I disagree with your interpretation of bitcoin. I don't believe that it formalises or enforces ANY ideological principles per se, not just libertarian ones. And I can qualify this by the fact that the essential core of Satoshi's whitepaper isn't about liberating currency or the autonomy of finance even if that's how it has been first applied.
I know this isn't a popular view round here -- yours is The Popular View for sure. So I'd be oddly disappointed if this doesn't receive a deluge of downvotes.
But I'll defend mine because I believe this popular view is dogmatic and is a fortiori an attempt to co-opt a *scientific* breakthrough. And that the science manifested in bitcoin -- its mathematically decentralised public asset ledger protocol -- is purely that: the most significant scientific and technological discovery in the networked age. All the politics and ideology this science-technology enables come AFTER it or from OUTSIDE it.
To give a historical analogy. Consider the discovery of atomic fission. This was a scientific breakthrough that emerged amid a highly politicised context, during a world war no less. The funding bodies of those nuclear researchers were waiting to build bombs from their findings. But we don't need to remind ourselves that atomic fission isn't a formalisation or enforcement of any ideology in particular, including that of American imperialism or N. Korean communism even if that's how it has been used (or abused). It's science first, and as such can be harnessed to many ends.
The nature of the protocol at its purest is information freed from conformity. So it's absurd to say that users must conform to it, especially coming from someone claiming to be libertarian.
@_date: 2013-12-15 02:54:06
You're smuggling this (ideological) principle into your reading of the protocol's technical nature. It's not the same thing. The remarkable novelty of Bitcoin is that it leaves open a variety of interpretations on what the protocol will mean sociopolitically. The fact of the matter is that this is still to be determined. And it makes no difference that (right) libertarians and an-caps are presently the most enthusiastic evangelists of the protocol.
Edit: A big weakness of right libertarian thought is that it makes no distinction between the state and government apparatuses in the pursuit of the market. Whereas (some) radical left alternatives tend to view the market as an extension of the state.

Thanks for this enjoyable post. 
For the sake of my pedantry though I'd just like to point out that voluntarism is far more associated with socialism historically speaking (e.g. Rousseau, Jacobins, etc) and therefore anti-capitalism by extension.
@_date: 2013-12-15 10:54:46


That's neither logically nor factually true but never mind!
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:50:48
Excellent translation. Thank you for doing this.
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:22:39
That was a pretty spectacular exercise in hearing what you want to hear. 
Saying X is attractive to Y doesn't make X 'fundamentally or undeniably Y in nature'. It just means that it's, erm, attractive to it.
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:03:19
@_date: 2013-12-15 03:26:27


This is a loop in your argument. And our disconnect. But never mind; each to their own. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 12:56:58
You've misunderstood what I said (re: the history of voluntarism) and offered a self-evidently narrow view of socialism. But you're perfectly entitled to it.
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:10:08


Which is why they're fundamentally indistinguishable from neo-liberals.
