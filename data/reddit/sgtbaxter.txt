Yeah, don't buy the keurig one because it sucks. There are much less expensive ones ($5-$10) that work a lot better.

If people want bitcoin to have real value, then it needs to be used. It's supposed to be a currency. Otherwise the interest is going to go away and it will be worthless.
This is why dogecoin is becoming as popular as it is. People are actually using it instead of simply hoarding it. Dogecoin will never hit $1 a coin. Hell, it won't even hit 10 cents. But it doesn't need to to work as a real currency.

Revolution is stupid. What did occupy accomplish? Oh yeah.. zilch. 
If you want real change the answer is to run for office. Run for Mayor. Run for seat on a town council, and move up from there. Our state governor started that way, he's thinking of making a presidental run now.
The people have the power to change government, because the people have the power to become government. Sitting at your computer and typing "I wish..." is doing nothing.

Yes, just like they can and have uninstall apps off your Android phone.

Someone gave me one for Christmas a few years back. It worked for 3 months then died. They sent me a new one free of charge. That one worked 3 months then died. They sent me a new one, free of charge. I sold it for $25 and went back to my old Krups.
I think I spend less in a year on coffee with my regular coffeemaker than I did in 3 months with that stupid thing.

Back in the day they didn't have to push 50 customers out the door every other minute like they do now though.
Companies are going to the self checkout kiosks not just to reduce the number of cashiers they have to employ, but also because you can fit 6 of them in the space you'd fit 2 normal registers and it's a lot faster throughput of customers for the quick few items that shopping trends have turned into.

And yet, Dogecoin has actually sent teams to the Olympics this year.
That's why people like it and are excited. People on the outside largely view bitcoin as a get rich quick scheme, and if that continues then bitcoin has nowhere to go but failure.

Everyone also swore HD-DVD would be the next digital medium because porn backed it at first.

I believe he is obligated to contact the authorities if someone willingly came forth and made the claim they wanted to purchase stolen credit cards. Can't simply deny the transaction.

Google is not like that at all. AOSP developers cannot distribute Google's apps. Android has been moving further and further away from open source. [Manufacturers have to pay google to have access to it's apps](

Now, apply what you just said to those who wrote the faulty protocols in the first place.

No, but you aren't a business.

Then just tip someone the equivalent of $0.25.

Theft is theft, no matter if it's cash, property or bitcoin.
If people are intentionally stealing bitcoin from other people under false pretenses it's illegal and they can be prosecuted.
The issue with bitcoin is something like refunds for products. Now, go to say Home Depot and buy something with cash you can always return it for cash no problems. But there are plenty of small companies that give you the runaround. If you paid cash, you're SOL - which is why companies like Visa and Mastercard are important. I wouldn't mind buying at Home Depot with bitcoin because I know I can return it without hassle. The little shop down the street I'd probably use my Visa for peace of mind.

Not to mention it's a lot less expensive to make a whole pot of coffee, drink one cup and toss the rest than it is to buy boxes of those k cups.

That it was originally an exchange for Magic The Gathering cards should have clued people off.

I find it funny people are ragging on apple as not allowing you to do what you want with your phones and cheering people getting a Nexus phone - yet [Google has actively deleted installed apps from users phones without even telling them](

I now understand bitcoin is just dandelions blowing in the wind.

TCP/IP isn't the same protocol it was in the '70's. It changes and evolves, which is why we now have ipv6 taking over. v4 is obsolete.
You can't simply work around the problems with the underlying bugs of bitcoin and put on a stupid happy face about it. Issues like transaction malleability need addressing.

Except Bitcoin has no regulation, so they should be able to do whatever they wish. It's up to the user of the potential services to be wary because these kinds of things will happen.

LMAO! Perfect!

It's not accurate at all because Dogecoin would be showering Bitcoin with tips the whole time.

Apple just approved a DogeCoin wallet. You should put them back on the list.
