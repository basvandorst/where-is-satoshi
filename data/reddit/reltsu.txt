GAW_CEO stated that users on reddit reaching out to merchants "spooked them".. Did anyone get a outright denial from any of the merchants listed by GAW?

I have a feeling that the CEO of GAW truly believes he can pull this off.. He did purchase 5PH/s from Bitmain.
But I agree, 6 months top before GAW is either tied up with lawsuits, regulation or just simply folds.

GAW's display of their logos is in direct violation of each companies conditions for using their logo..
For example, see:
and 
Per the second link, GAW must display "“Amazon, the Amazon logo, AmazonSupply, and the AmazonSupply logo are trademarks of Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates.” " on pages that display the amazon logo.. Already  alerted Amazon legal to this matter.

BTW, Excellent work.. Would also suggest scouring the previous videos on youtube for promises that can be proven false (I've already mirrored all the youtube Q&amp;A just in case the disappear).
Lets not focus on trying to discredit GAW to the internet masses, but rather focus on compiling and submitting evidence to the proper legal authorities. 
If we continue to rant and rave and point out the obvious, GAW will simply take the role of the victim and fuel their efforts from our attacks. Funneling our efforts through proper channels such as law enforcement is the best route. They have the authority to subpoena and investigate any allegations..
If we take this route, GAW will be unable to play the victim since if they are 100% legit, GAW will have nothing to worry about..
Don't play into GAW's game by making them the victim and giving them an excuse for their failure..

I've heard rumors of GAW's invite to Miami being a setup of sorts... Have no clue if those rumors are true though.

I think the community is concerned that this is some sort of Ponzi scheme or the fact that GAW has been making statements/promises that aren't being fullfilled.. 
If you want to satisfy the community, GAW should be fully transparent and honest.. In addition, they named "PayCoin" as the "BitCoin" replacement, which I believe annoyed a good majority of the community.

Contact gopago and have them file a complaint against GAW.. It's clearly a infringement on their logo.

Ditto.. GAW promised everyone back in November that all the names of partners would be released after Paybase was released.. Still waiting on the names..

Wondering what government agency will tackle this type of fraud (Currently in reaching out to multiple agencies to see which one would like to tackle this issue).. If he wants us to stop calling him a fraud, a independent audit by a reputable third party of the reserves would be more than enough to satisfy most of us..
On a side note, I hear the bitcoin convention in Miami, where Josh will be on a panel (Who knows why) will be rather interesting. Dodging questions on a moderated Q&amp;A vs a live audience is very different!

If he rolls out credit card sales, my first call will be to his credit card processor to file complaints regarding allowing the purchase of digital currency (Which is forbidden by most, if not all credit card processors.. Hi current processor, Stripe, strictly prohibits this.. They will seize his merchant account for violation of TOS).. Second call will be to my credit card company to report this as a fraudulent product!

Well, if people attend and ask him hard questions with compelling evidence, the results should be...EPIC.. Try dodging questions in front of a crowd of people that don't come from HashTalk.

I would suggest checking business filings to confirm that Cantos is involved with GAW.
Anyone notice how Cantor's Twitter account sort of revolves around GAW Miners?

BoA customer with linked Coinbase.com account.. No issues with BoA for over a year.
Im guessing the account is rather new (no historical activity) or the activity is out of the ordinary for the account.
Probably has something to do with one of the reasons at:

Banks are trying to avoid BSA/AML fines.
Would suggest reading: 
What state are you located in? Curious if Coinbase is registered MSB in your state..
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:52:20
The accounts belong to the bank and they are responsible for BSA/AML compliance.. If they are found to be negligent, they have to pay a fine..
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:57:53
Would suggest just going to your local branch and politely ask the questions Cozk has above.. Just explain Coinbase.com is a US based business that deals with digital currency, etc etc.

Banks use algorithms to detect suspicious activity. This letter was most likely generated by a automated system.
If activity is flagged, you can either explain to the bank why it shouldn't be flagged or cease the activity. Typically they won't explain why the activity was flagged (the specific criteria) since this would allow criminals to simply avoid detection after a few tries, but rather request that you cease transaction with the merchant involved.
Your best bet is to simply go to a local branch and speak with bank representative.
