Banks devour far more energy now than bitcoin ever will. Plus, miners mostly use renewable energy, possibly helping green energy adoption as well. In the end, there will be a net gain effect.

Yes, all you need to do is search for the wallet address

It's frustrating trying to get people to read the paper, let alone understand halvings, limited supply vs demand etc. It's 9 pages of high school reading material that you can finish and digest on your lunch break. I guess it is too much to ask for, which is why I am also long-term bullish (10+ years) lol

Sorry, they are gone then. Definitely get all remaining coins off any exchanges and into a hardware wallet, or at least into an open source cold storage wallet like mycelium until you can get a hard wallet.

It is a fascinating paper, happy to help!

Not if, but when. I don't know the answer, but what happens after is up to you.

Yep, make it impossible or extremely expensive to buy bitcoin. Do not underestimate our enemy. Without them, we wouldn't be here. They will destroy the power grid and nuke entire states and countries, kill everything including themselves before letting btc replace the dollar. There are no depths they haven't sunk to, and it's our job to cut off the cancer before this happens. Do not underestimate our enemy.

It's both. There are both anonymous and transparent ways of using it
@_date: 2019-07-07 20:13:03
Lmao, do people really fall for this?

Absolutely, no doubt, mass understanding economically is far more advantageous, at least right now. I have to disagree that the technical side exists solely to influence the econimic behavior, unless you're talking about the miners crucial part in this experiment.

Hhahahhaha love it!

What is your email address? I'm not able to scan the QR code, but I will email you a few bitcoins

That is all any of us can do is to learn and grow, even if we can never fully understand it. I don't pretend to understand it all myself. I do feel that we are in the early stages, for better or worse.

I'm surprised that congress admitted in so few words that crypto will "disrupt" the global economy; meaning threaten the very foundation of fiat currency, however flimsy it is. The boat is rocking...

Check the blockchain, if the tx has been confirmed, there is no way to get them back. Try sending the coins to another wallet asap if you can.

The government, and especially the supreme court, are experts at rewording laws so they pass and achieve the same or more result as a previous unpassed law. It's called "legalese" and nothing is off the table. They could tax bitcoin 200%, but I suspect the US gov has a heavy hand in btc due to it's unsurpassed clandestine activities all around the world.

Great response! I'll have to reply in sections. Hope it's not too long.
Yes, you've pointed out one of a few flaws with digital currency in general. I think the benefits will outweight those flaws though. Bitcoin is designed as a true digital money; among less tangible ideas. As long as there is internet, there will be bitcoin. Ironically, I think fiat currency is a much more interesting subject than money because it is such a new invention in our history and highly malleable.
The blockchain hash solves the double spending problem and eliminates the need for banks or visa/mastercard etc. I agree this is the engine for cryptocurrency, in addition to the incentive for miners.
And yet, your last paragraph describes a very real future possibility for digital currency. It's very interesting, and too early to say for now.

Absolutely, the blockchain has near limitless real-world uses where trust is involved (practically everything). We've only seen a pebble at the base of this mountain, crawling closer to the peak every day. I especially like your example of safe voting systems; that could prove to be invaluable given recent events. Thank you!

About as secure as other major online wallets. It doesn't have any features besides buy/sell and deposit/withdraw but the fees are only ~1.5% even with credit cards and everything is instant. I like it better than coinbase with all their restrictions. It's just a simple app to buy/sell but I wouldn't store large amounts of coins for long periods of time obviously.

Probably the worst idea I've ever seen, so go for it!

The value lies in the fact that it is limited in quantity and people want it. It doesn't have any practical use like gold, but in todays digital age, that might even be a good thing. I think that bitcoins weakest link is that it relies on computers and a power grid, both of which may not exist 100, 1000 years from now.
