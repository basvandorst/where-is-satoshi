Then pass Segwit already instead of keeping up the politics before the network implodes under its own weight.

I've got one and it works great. It was very easy to set up synced with iPhone no problem and funds transferred in fine.

As a person who simply would like to use bitcoin some of his arguments are valid. As a user and saver of bitcoin I do want confirmation time to be quick and right now the average time of transactions takes hours which in my opinion is too long. One of the potential benefits of BTC is low fees. right now they are pretty high. Of course everyone wants them to be zero which is also not fair. But cheap would be good. The network is clearly contested. It would be great to solve these issues now. 
I have no skin in the game but did listen to a LTB podcast interview last week that said he is FOR SEGWIT. 
In any event sadly it seems all this in fighting has both segwit and block size failing which is no help to the community at all. 
I want my friends to be able to use this. It's hard to convince them under current circumstances. 
One other point I think Roger is right on is guess what as a user, other coins are starting to make sense having solved these problems. 
So go on - keep fighting instead of solving and you will drive people away. 
For BTC to be viable long run it has to be usable. Right now for many people sadly the only thing it's good for is paying ransomeware.

I worked there back in 2000 and even back then I remember taking $200 worth of bolivars out of an atm and it was a huge wad of cash. I can’t even imagine now.

I don't drink but that is a pretty awesome use of a miner.
