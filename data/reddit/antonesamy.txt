LN is using real bitcoins not exchanged for tokens as you assume... it is basically uses an on chain timelock to operate  so in the end you will get to close it at some point .. specially if you want to secure a big amount into a cold storage... best analogy is a checking account (LN) vs a saving account (on chain) or a credit card (LN) vs a banking account (on chain)

nice talk
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:47:48
you are talking like there are only 10 ppl selling and buying it ... it is a global thing with millions of ppl and a lot of countries with different sentiments "at any given moment" actively engaged. what you are telling is already happening now for many months already and till date it is holding strong at a pretty decent level despite the currently mass selling/fud and relatively low interest... with time more ppl specially the rich ones will start hedging their wealth by buying and holding at any given price. with limited supply and halving, the price will inevitably go up, in a month, a year or even 10 years from now, unless the technology fails
@_date: 2018-09-10 21:00:44
A lot of ppl already sold... most of the currently remaining hodlers, who didn't sell when the price went up to 8-10k, have higher expectations and they are not going to sell before that  
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:21:45
that is why preventing minors from trading could even be a good news in the long run
@_date: 2018-05-08 16:24:20
that is a lot bigger and better than cme &amp; cboe ... that is a true physical bitcoin exchange by the biggest stock market in the world.

genius 
@_date: 2018-05-08 18:57:55
this is not an instrument to short like cme ... this is a real exchange that requires the holding of real bitcoins to be able to short, this in turn will pour the wall street whales into the crypto world and hence it will create a great demand in the other exchanges 
@_date: 2018-05-04 13:42:34

@_date: 2017-08-15 04:40:06
Well said, but problem is there are some whales that are unethically manipulating the markets both ways and that is the main reason behind the question actually ... They seem to get bigger each day and have more manipulative power (their BTCs grow bigger against the fixed 21millions) ... what could stop them from causing more disruption and volatility over time ... these **whales/exchanges** could become at some point a more **centralized power** that control the price 
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:10:13
but you can't use the same LN channel for both trading and purchases at the same time ... I believe that is what the op is asking about 
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:41:56
its less than a million actually ... we are not talking about ethereum here where vilalik and his gang have ~ 70% of the coins
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:29:27
It is a **chain of continuously created blocks** that are **storing** new **data**, where every new block has/begins with the **header** of the previous one so that you can't change any of the data on the older blocks because this will change their header as well and make it invalid... these chain of blocks are **distributed** everywhere and that makes "the stored data" even far more **immutable**
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:42:17
And what exactly are they getting into?! 
I only see a crap clone that just disabled segwit and the further development possibilities and have no competent development team and made the block size 8mb giving only 4x capacity for mass adoption yet compromising the decentralization and causing blockchain exponential non maintainable size growth
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:57:54
it could lead to a pow change
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:58:33
that's why bitcoin must remain and rise in its dominance ... those altcoin bubbles are harming and destroying the essential fundamental of being scarce
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:56:06
your fees are ridiculously low, Fee per byte	1 sat/B = 225 sats, that is less than a cent transaction and might not go through, I suggest contacting gdax to replace this transaction with a higher fee

yes, you will need to export your private keys or have the seed ... btw, you already have 2 free bch coins  (worth more than 1200$ ) if you had the bitcoins before aug 1st

if only you are lucky and faster enough than the bots
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:10:51
you might get that transaction confirmed in the next 2 days though ... mempool have ~40MB &gt; 1sat/b transactions ... that's 40 blocks away which is doable especially that the difficulty will get lower tomorrow and segwit will increase the capacity
@_date: 2017-08-08 10:31:03
currently the rate is below 8% yearly which is not worth it compared with the risk of putting and lockin your money in the exchage
@_date: 2017-08-20 01:36:23
Most redditors and bitcointalk users will try it soon after segwit's activation ... it will take time for the majority of the other users
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:32:34
Agree, but 1 bitcoin is an exaggeration though, unless you will hard fork and increase the decimals to 32 or something 
@_date: 2017-08-14 08:00:37
If that ever happened .. a simple solution would be a change  of pow 
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:09:24
that is happening in less than 23 hours from now .... only 880 blocks are remaining @ current rate of ~38 / hour 
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:37:21
rapid rise = rapid fall 
the last 1850$ dip was because of the fud was at its max due to hardforking and scaling dilemma which is now over 
so your assumption about the correction needing to last for days is wrong
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:08:58
I believe the same but actually no one knows 
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:39:35
actually this is the drop everyone was hoping for, judging the charts and volume, I'd say it will be one of the lamest dips with a quick recovery over few hours 
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:27:01
No, Its poloniex and they will still credit BCH on 14th august and they stated before the fork that if you lent your coins during the split you will not get the forked coin
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:56:10
Yet half of it was eaten up ... he will probably try to get them back at a higher price now 
It has a positive effect actually as it failed miserably this time although the wall was pretty big ... the market used to be manipulated with half of that wall before  
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:51:09
that kind of 1 satoshi spams could happen to 100MB blocks as well ... its a way for the miners to force increase the fees ... there will be a fix for that eventually with 2nd layer solutions 
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:05:42
I don't think he is wrong, I'm not the op
@_date: 2017-08-05 01:46:21
I actually lent 75% of my BTC for 4.5% daily interest rate and it turned out being the better deal :)
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:04:34
Those are the miners who couldn't resist making more money in the short run even if that means destroying the whole bitcoin idea
It is important to note that since BCH's current difficulty is set @ 7% then if it actually has to retain any value, the fair value shouldn't exceed 0.07 btc otherwise we are forcing a bigger proportion of miners into leaving bitcoin mining for that altcoin..
People have fallen into the fomo and the obvious price manipulation involved with this coin and are acting irrationally ...
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:05:49
correction could be up or down ... the current rise could be a pent up correction from the previous forking and scaling drama
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:24:15
Because there are only 21 million real Bitcoins and it would be worse if those manipulative whales got more BTCs in their hands
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:58:21
when was the previous one ?!
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:20:45
bitcoin will not be much affected by chain switching compared to the other alt
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:45:20
3800+ there is already a big resistance at 3900 ... this is a lame dip imo
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:05:10
it will happen before that as the miners will switch to bitcoin after ~15 hours (difficulty adjustment of bch)
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:22:37
Alts stole the show in the beginning of the year, and bitcoin is just reacting :)
@_date: 2017-08-07 05:49:00

the only winners will be the miners who will make a lot of coins in very short time and suck a lot of money from a lot of people and are the ones who will try to manipulate the prices as long as possible to get more $$$

Don't worry, that's the ideology of true hodlers me included... its about financial freedom rather than big money gains
@_date: 2017-08-15 08:22:35
the simple answer would be a decentralized exchange
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:36:14
Seeing that till now, this lock-in period: more than 70% of the blocks have been mined @ 100% segwit signaling + no one ever tried to mine a non segwit block and mostly likely they will get rejected if they tried to do so (because of UASF) ... I can safely assume that segwit will activate in time 
currently 607 blocks out of 707 remaining need to signal segwit to reach 95% threshold, that is only 85% of the remaining blocks, and this probability gets even higher with every block mined

@_date: 2017-08-29 21:13:10
he still hold them and it is questionable if he will ever move them due to the fact that they never got moved those many years despite these exponential rise in price 
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:30:35
That is why it will take less time to dump the price .... rapid rise = rapid fall
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:08:51
You might be right again but people know satoshi by his early coins ... any other theory is of no importance, proof and doesn't impact the bitcoin's future

dude, antpool operate @ 1 PH/sec out of which there are 150K foreign workers involved .... translating these into real numbers at least 150K mining rigs ( multiply that with a mean 5 TH/sec for each rig = 150000x5= 750,000 TH = 0.75 PH/sec that's 75% of the pools power that could actually switch to any other pool at any time
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:03:25
Remember Bitcoin only has risen by 300% this year while most of the alts including ETH had 4000% increase
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:53:40
For anyone that doesn't realise that we already have a better altcoin that is tested and been around for many years aka Litecoin, which has 1MB block/2.5 min (that is 4MB/10 mins) and even with segwit it is effectively ~2x4mb (8MB/10min) + plus all the advantages of segwit and atomic swaps .... etc
Bitcoin Cash supporters could you please enlighten us what is BCH's advantage over even the simplest and oldest bitcoin clones (Litecoin)
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:45:47
no because your bitcoins are actually locked

From this source :
There are more than 11.2 Million ... but the vast majority of users are keeping their coins in exchanges especially in china, korea and japan ... I would say at least 30-40 million users so far
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:57:38
securing your wealth in the most secure and decentralized network will be more important than the fees ... compare btc to ltc's price which has 4x capacity and almost no fees
@_date: 2017-08-05 02:19:17
we are too early for this 2x dilemma, if we crossed the current major resistance level, we could reach 5000$ before reaching the anticipated 2x fork
@_date: 2017-08-02 09:56:07
That is a bit wild to assume and with no development and innovation, its hard to think it will grow in value anytime soon ... currently there is some people that are taking advantage of the rarity of exchanges and practicing some pumps and FOMOs that will resolve by time 
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:12:31
Truth is no one knows for sure... you have to access the situation yourself... If you are planning to hold your bitcoins for the long run and be able to ignore at least up to 20% dips then sure the price will rise above 4k
@_date: 2017-08-16 13:41:10
First we have to be scalable enough for daily mass purchases 
After that there are 2 possible events that could stabilize the price and make it a better currency than investment ...
-the price increase a lot to the point that 100-300$ swings are negligible
-there is mass adoption and more legal acceptance for it globally especially from usa, russia and china... There are currently many signs that suggest broader acceptance soon ... since we are about to get bitcoin options and derivatives before the end of this year
Also, I think there should be a better redistribution of wealth which leads to less manipulative power, but the should be fixed by mass adoption and time 
@_date: 2017-08-08 01:32:26
this article suggests 2x value increase every 8 months ... by that we might reach 100K in 2021 
I think the bitcoin world is continuing to prove how crazy nice it really is.. Price doubling every 8 months is believable/doable to me as there is a lot of room for mass and big organizational adoption ... after all, currently japan is the only country considering bitcoin as a currency ... we will see a lot of countries following that lead
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:19:19
yea, after all, they are just paper with some cheap ink on it 
@_date: 2017-08-07 06:14:24
The 40GB growth/month is actually based on the last 2 months only ... if that remained, they'll reach 1TB blockchain in about a year
@_date: 2017-08-07 05:03:40
source : 
Eth growth rate over 1.4 years : ~2500% ( meaning that the size increased 25 times since april 2016 ) 
Current ethereum blockchain growth rate ( based on the last 2 months ) : 40+GB / month
Before the end of this year the size of a full node is projected to be more than 0.5 TB
Based on that, the chain is projected to be over 1Tb in less than 12 months. If it continues that growth rate it'll die; space = $$$$ 
Big blockers is a failed scaling solution for mass adoption and means more centralization power where nodes can only be stored in big datacenters that would be scarce and eventually could easily get tracked and shut down by government organizations 
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:42:42
so you need 35,700,000 bolivars to buy a whole bitcoin ... Ironically, early 2016 bolivar was ~0.2 usd

I don't know, I actually lent my Bitcoins @ poloniex's ~5% interests so I will not eventually get those BCHs... I might have lost some money @ the current bch rate but at least I'm certain of my profit at this moment while BCH might drop a lot in the coming days

bitfinex 
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:21:20
They put the order and removed it in few seconds 
Also not many big investors could deposit or trust large amount of money with bitfinex to counter those spoofings ... 
USDT is allegedly made by bitfinex so they might be taking advantage of it to manipulate the prices as their wish ... also usdt can't be withdrawn to any country other than taiwan so no big traders would risk converting real usd to usdt to get in the game

Crypto is the craziest market ever ... no one knows anything for sure but this could be the moment when all alt bubbles begin to burst ... Eth is in a bubble anyway, remember that it rose 40x times in 2 months  
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:02:05
that is one of the most hostile ways to destroy bitcoin ... people are giving it more value more than it deserve ... there is an artificial scarcity because most people didn't bother with spliting their coins or are scared to fuck up, making it more scarce than bitcoin and easier to manipulate ... 
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:29:14
First, the transactions are replaceable... if the transaction is stuck in mempool, it will clear and return to u after a certain period
@_date: 2017-08-15 08:24:44
but they should be able to filter the spam transactions
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:57:39
this could compromise the whole bitcoin's integrity in the long run ... creating another 21 million coins with additive value is against the nature of bitcoin's limited supply
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:10:26
4x will make the profit ratio 4x less profitable ... most miners will leave as a result so the real difficulty will be far greater compared to the remaining miners

Everyone knew this will eventually happen 
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:58:39
volume is flying around 3 Billion daily but there are a lot of amateur day traders here ruin it... also given the fact that btc is limited to 21millions, any non-zero fee trading is virtually a loss because... given the fact that there is &gt;10 exchanges with 50K+ volume that charge about 0.2% on trades, that is 100BTC daily for each of these exchanges ( that's 1000BTCs wasted daily on fees on 10 exchanges) ... it's different that fiat because it has a fixed scarce supply
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:11:12
far less than 9 hours ... 4-5 at max at the current rate (42 / hour) and miners will start moving back before the actual adjustment block
@_date: 2017-08-26 20:29:11


that is the most interesting part of the article, that number translates into 25000 x 12.5T Hashes = 0.312 Peta hashes = only 4.4% out of the network's 7 Peta Hashes .... we shouldn't give bitmain much attention as they don't really hold that much mining power in control anyway  
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:41:55
dude, segwit isn't activated yet 
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:19:58
in about 24 hours from now 
@_date: 2017-08-05 02:25:38
highly unlikely and still too early to assume even that there will be any hard fork this year... things could accelerate after segwit activation and we may reach better scaling solutions that could kick the 2x out of the equation  
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:41:40
most likely it won't go lower than that at least until segwit activates and even after that we could get a huge jump from LN real use and sidechain innovations ... also bitcoin options are kicking in in few weeks as LedgerX stated
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:03:26
that dip that many are talking about might not happen, last 4 days there were a lot of trials to manipulate the market yet the dips never passed the 100-200$ mark till now... this time could be different as BTC and the cryptoworld is gaining more attention and this time we have a lot of money that is already in altcoins (which are obviously going to fall after the unrealistic price jumps that happened at the beginning of the year)  that could easily flow back and increase the BTC price
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:27:25
One day, we'll be able to broadcast transactions too, its already possible to do so without internet via SMS 
It is a step forward into making bitcoin available globally 
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:02:01
Miners might eventually give up on the 2x part if they economically see a big loss by trying to enforce it .. if there is a practically implemented better scalling solution before that date then most likely there will be no 2mb forking to happen at all
Remember that miners follow the economic chain not the other way around .... there are hundreds of coins out there with better scalling solutions yet no miners care about them because they hold no value 
Also with segwit real activation and sidechains and the usa approved btc options, price will most likely rise a lot before that date
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:26:29
there are no rules when it comes to crypto ... they used to follow the bitcoin's lead but lately the bitcoin is stealing the show and they now (in terms of dollar value) generally stay the same when bitcoin go up and decrease in value when bitcoin go down 
@_date: 2017-08-15 05:40:33
and the hardest part here is that we need to maintain the core network features of being decentralized, fungible and immutable  
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:49:49

he means if you converted your bch to btc or fiat you get extra 450$ to each btc you own ... this will probably not last for much longer as it there is not much liquidity right now and there is some pumping going on which will eventually get dumped hard

1-2 days at max as the difficulty will be decreased and the mining profitability will increase ... miners will allocate greater hash power resulting in less than 10 min blocks for the whole next period
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:01:59
Wow, that is a fatal flaw... I can't understand how people still give that BitCH any value .... that coin could hyperinflate and reach the 21 million very soon... People need to be aware of that as miners will suck a lot of money out of them if they don't realize that soon enough ...

Do whatever you want with your BCH but I'm advising that converting BTC to BCH at this point is more risky than trading any other altcoin with far more established exchanges... 
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:26:04
Difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks 
Currently 36 blocks per hour x 24 hours x 2 days = 1728 blocks which is more than the remaining in the current difficulty period 
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:53:07
Just wait till segwit kicks in (a week from now) and other 2nd layer solutions, these fees are artificially being increased by the miners themselves by spamming the network with low fee transactions .... this will change eventually... 
That kind of spam could be made @ any block size, I could literally spam and make 100,000,000 BCH non-zero fee transactions and that will only cost me 1 BCH yet that will force filling the 8MB blocks and make the blockchain huge and unmaintainable in the long run, thats a real security concern that need little cost to execute 
A little hint: (225 bytes x 100,000,000) = ~22,000,000 KB = ~22GB ... and with only 100BCH = 2200GB = 2.2TB that have to be stored in every full node forever and that's already above the limits of an average user's disk space that is required to maintain the network's decentralization

I believe people won't respond too much to this fud cycle 
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:49:54
and the only winners here are the miners who are currently making.... 45 blocks / hour = 13,500 coins per day = 9 Million $ are stolen from people each day until the coin dies then they will manipulate it the next cycle and people will fall for it each time ..
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:38:27
the market has clearly chosen who is the winner 
@_date: 2017-08-26 20:53:53
It is better for them to claim to have more power over the network to be able to manipulate the market so there is no incentive for them to give a lower number than they actually have... if 25k is not true then it is less not more
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:19:09
Sorry if you are offended, not intended but currently 95% of the active BCH exchanges are chinese ones and they either suffer from some major market manipulation or they actually are confused and don't understand the whole situation and think that its an upgrade or something and I believe it is the later.
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:03:39
The majority have learnt the lesson from the last dip / rapid rise and will not get involved this time ... I once lost 10% of my investment because I followed one of those panic sells ... never to touch my precious BTCs again... Let those fuckers play themselves and shake &amp; steal only those weak hands until there is none left
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:16:27
Actually it could be that some major chinese and japanese exchanges started crediting BCH already and hence the price dipped in those markets by how much the bch value is anticipated .. needs confirmation though and if that is the case then you better hodle for the extra little free BCH cash

that small computer will not be able to download that block in time causing a latency problem and encourage and all sorts of cheating and double spending ... only 144 blocks are mined each day that's 144MB adding another 126mb to it is no better than making the blocks bigger

@_date: 2017-08-22 12:43:27
Since BCH's current difficulty is set @ 7% then if it actually has to retain any value, the fair value shouldn't exceed 0.07 btc otherwise we are forcing a bigger proportion of miners into leaving bitcoin mining for that altcoin.. 
People have fallen into the fomo and the obvious price manipulation involved with this coin ... 
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:08:14
can't happen @ this point .... there are few pools but there are a lot of individual miners across the world ... antpool alone has 100K+ workers ... if it shut down they will simply switch to other pool or mine solo

ethereum had a lot more exchanges and volume and tumbled from 400 to 160 $ in few days
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:07:49
the dip was yesterday to 3850$, it seems the market is already recovering and have a far bigger chance to go up than down due to segwit, bitcoin options, LN and the current world politics... the short-term price movements and mainstream attention guarantees that there will be no slow down or up trends in the near future

tumblebit is already there to solve the fungibility for BTC
@_date: 2018-06-30 03:01:22
if someone dumped @ 12k he could buy 2x at 6k ... simple as that ... a lot of btcs were dumped and they are buying again and may be even more than the amount they already dumped  
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:31:05
yes that is one side chain solution that could do the job ... 
the main point here is again that there is no need to spam the main blockchain with tiny transactions that would be stored forever
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:06:07
It could set a much higher base soon considering the upcoming segwit activation and LN readiness, the anticipated bitcoin options and etf approval, and the increasing mainstream and institutional attention  
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:41:09
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:09:28
By resistance, I mean the actually executed buy orders and volume traded against the price drop

it was totally estimated to worth 20 billion and it is divided into 50 btcs in each address so the answer is no

I guess it will rise to an ATH before the segwits activation 
@_date: 2018-06-12 05:03:09
it is achieving both ... on chain frangibility is being done as well through shnorr and bulletproof 
@_date: 2019-02-25 18:04:57
some non-trading whales are impatient and sell without buying again and  a lot of big bitcoin holders (100+btcs) are actively trading and fail to buy in profit specially in future markets like bitmex ... these help better distribution in the long run.. until eventually the numbers of big whales will be fewer and have lesser power to manipulate the markets 
@_date: 2019-02-25 17:37:36
there is still some bearishness in the air so the whales took advantage of it .... if the sentiment turned bullish among the masses and there are more ppl buying ... the whales will only manipulate the price up as that is the winning bet.. think about it like that: right now whales don't dare to manipulate the price below 3k so they only could manipulate the price within limits 
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:58:19
it's down only 100 so far ... there should be a correction because of the rapid rise of the price lately but I'm pretty sure there won't be a too much impact on the price this time ...

People believe that some whales are selling big amounts but if you looked closely you will realize that opening new big short positions / closing long positions are the true reason behind the sudden price drops at bitfinex specially in the past few days (you could watch the chart at 1 min intervals to know what is really happening)
We are currently at 21k+ shorts and the longs are relatively low right now so any buying pressure or new long positions will lead to a great short squeeze driving the price up 
I believe someone/some group are using the margin orders irrationally in the past 2 days and are trying to lower the price as much and as fast as they can to draw a certain pattern and trick the bots and the crowds into thinking that the price should dip further so that they can close their short positions with profits when the price fall ... unless people stop following them they will continue to do so ..

@_date: 2018-02-08 04:20:11
if we passed the next few days above 7k ... I guarantee you that the price will rise afterwards ... people are realizing that the dip is way oversold and the slower the rise the more consolidation we get and that gives more people time to buy... that is more healthy than being manipulated by few big players

if more people bought and hodled the price eventually would be forced to rise and the losers will be some of the manipulators and the people who followed them ...
let me give you a more simple explanation, if there are 100 manipulators each have 1000 btcs, that is 100k btcs, each one of them is trying to hold more btcs by selling high and buying low ... lets now say that there are 10k people that will buy and hold 1 btc. ... now there is only 90k btcs left for the 100 manipulators to get (actually less than that due to the market fees) ... some of them will win more and more of them will lose but eventually the manipulation power is 10K btcs less than before ... I hope you get the idea , with time passing and with each manipulation and with more adoption the manipulation will get weaker ... if you are holding and not panic selling then you should actually be pleased for these dips!! because if filters the shaky hands and give more chance for new hodlers to enter

@_date: 2018-02-14 05:17:40
here is how the market psychology works, the more people wanting the price to dip from here, the less likely there will be a dip and vice versa
Also, the longer the price holds despite the big selling pressure the less likely there will be a major dip any time soon because most of the people that sold wish to buy at a lower price and the longer it holds the bigger the fomo that will build up within all those sellers which will create a bigger buying pressure at any lower price 
these are facts, not my opinions

time will convince them, i have more than a friend who bought the dip and said that they will hold and forget about it for few years , they only bought with few hundred dollars and they don't care if they lost most of them 
with more acceptance and mainstream adoption, many rich people will have this mentality of buying and holding even a fraction of a bitcoin  and when the price go low, more could afford entering the market as hodlers because they will get the btc at a price that they could afford to lose... what if a million out of the 7 billion ppl did that this year and what if governments started to buy some reserves?

The chart above show how the short and long positions affect the price swings... it follows the price since the rise to 11250$ until now and how every dip is fueled by either opeining new shorts or closing some opened longs 
- Bitfinex price (candles)
- Bitfinex Long positions (green lines)
- Bitfinex Short positions (red lines)
People need to realise that with margin trading some dude with only 10 BTCS could gamble up to 1000 BTC with 100x leverage ... margin trading are the true reason behind most of the current dips and mostly people start following them recklessly thinking that some big whales are controlling the markets which is not the case most of the times 
Interestingly, the current shorts (16K) are at the highest level since Feb 2nd (6k price) and the longs are at a relatively low level which is bullish

@_date: 2017-05-29 07:53:50
-Now we have a lot of real fiat money paid to get those bitcoins (so not a lot of people will sell at lower than they paid) ... this always sets the support level to a higher trend over time ... 
-The more bigger is the community, the more liquidity provided and hence the more the diverse in opinions and speculations ... all this lower the volatility
-A lot of exchanges are opened since 2013 and that means no single player or wale could now manipulate the market too much as before ... 
-No mt gox (hopefully)
-Legalization in many countries &amp; increasing news and media attention now helps a lot too ... that wasn't there before
-With time passing, people become more confident on the technology &amp; its resilience and immutability as well as having no single hacking incident in all those past years despite the high value and incentive of the bitcoin since 2015 ... no one was sure about those things back in 2013
The only threat now is the scalability issue, once its solved  there will be more room for mass adoption which strengthen bitcoin even more.

These will be empty blocks because there is no real market adoption to BCH... in fact many alts have better scaling than bch but this doesn't give them value or real use cases
BCH will fail soon because there is 8x data and bandwidth required for the blockchain which will cause more centralization

@_date: 2017-07-24 23:15:20
I believe unless there is a big negative news suddenly appear... volatility will get lower and price will consolidate and rise gradually... that news could be a sudden multi mining pool change in the segwit activation signaling, still highly unlikely but possible till the next difficulty adjustment 
The sure next big thing will be in november ... many things could happen until then and the price could go up to 4K before that date which will make the expected dip above the 3K range

never buy during those bull or bear runs, you will most likely lose much in the short term and you will get more fear and eventually more irrational actions will be taken trying to restore the loses... after you become more involved in this and when time passes, you will start to realise that the best bet is to hodl your bitcoin without trading and buy in a regular basis if you want to grow them bigger... any winning from the trading is simply gambling that worked out for you this time but could go terribly wrong the next time specially if you got more greedy

Sorry, but I can't trust my btc's with jihan's pockets specially now

it was actually a pullback up from the bear market made by the japanese exchanges for the previous few hours (japanese working hours) ... it appear that for the past few days the japanese are experiencing more fud than the other markets and now their prices are lower than every other exchange instead of having at least a 100$+ premium price gap in the past

this is still in the early adoption phase .. once everything is stabilized and the altcoin mania is over .. and we reach a price where 100-200 dollar volatility per day is trivial the majority will accept it as a currency

 tldr; Finally, I just panic sold and I need to get reassured that what I did was right so I'm posting about it here 
@_date: 2017-07-25 04:00:34
It still has some support by miners which will allocate a small percentage of their hashes to bcc ... They should let the markets decide though and give advantage of early volatilities till it dies and then disable it when that happens ... they already list a lot of shitcoins with shit values and volumes so this is not a valid excuse 
@_date: 2017-07-15 04:52:05
couldn't we do a public donation ad campaign through this reddit community or bitcointalk forums ... I would be happy to donate few $$ to support it... I'm sure it will be successful &amp; many will participate on such a cause
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:10:34
Guess what "0 day redditor" troll, no miners intend to move to Bcash including [Jihan]( [Jeff garzik]( [Roger ver]( and even [viabtc](
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:47:52
Actually it could be the other way around, i.e: the current value of bch @ viabtc which is ~0.12 BTC (~320$) is already considered as a free bonus to the btc's current value... people usually anticipate and act to things before they actually happen, in that sense, you would assume that if bch fallen to 20$, btc will go up by 300$... no one knows what could happen for sure though... even both btc and bch could go higher than these expectations like what happened with ETH and ETC forking ... time will tell
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:29:55
we are still in the price discovery phase and we are not ready for mass adoption yet ... we will soon though after the scaling solutions kick in
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:58:07
yea, until the markets mature, it is still in its infancy 
@_date: 2017-07-11 05:30:48
all coins seem to follow only bitcoin price in 99.99% of the time including even ripple... everytime bitcoin fall, all of them fall 2x faster... no need to diversify as this is clear as shit..
I actually do believe that the real reason behind this latest dip is the rapid rise of the altcoins and ico hypes which are destined to fall.. bringing down bitcoin with them but it is the one that is the least affected
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:40:05
lol, not even 10/1
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:23:40
In reality no miner ever did that in any of the previous forks... look at the current segwit activation period, no single miner is risking to lose a block reward by not signaling for sw which is an interesting observation...
@_date: 2017-07-16 03:25:03
and now its 2040 (+110$) in an hour ... also there are multiple big 500+ buying walls @ bitfinex and other exchanges at the 2000s range 
@_date: 2017-07-12 01:59:36
those crashes don't last for long though... keep in mind that bitcoin is going down for some obvious reasons including the ico hypes &amp; altcoin pumps &amp; the scaling situation and those will end soon ... also you need to understand that bitcoin is the enemy of gold, silver and fiat, so in a normal situation, the silver crash would boost the bitcoin price &amp; if that silver crash could prove anything, it just proves that no asset is value resistant including the dollar itself &amp; this even helps bitcoin to grow
My guess is that almost all that sold their coins now are waiting to buy back in when the price is going lower that they sold and I assume they will buy before august 1st to keep their hands on both coins in case of a hard fork... so there would be a lot of a buying forces at some point soon &amp; the price will shoot back up much faster than you think but God knows when... you could try to do the same but I believe it is already too late as now could be the lowest point ( there is a lot of tested resistance @ 2200$ ) or may be it could go as low as 1800$ ( the assumed second big resistance ) 
@_date: 2017-07-31 02:34:25
it's dirty game... truth is that there are many people who shorted bitcoin in the past few days and they are trying to bring the price down at any cost to buy back in, before its too late... and the fact that many people are upvoting a very old news is confirming how pissed they really are.
@_date: 2017-07-19 02:48:30
2 more pools with 2%+ could put us in a more certain position for activation in this period ... currently f2p are doing a dirty bear market before jumping in 
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:39:00
They need to clarify that asap to give us an option to withdraw before they disable that... they must credit us those bcc tokens if they don't want to list them, otherwise it is a pure robbery
@_date: 2017-07-31 08:53:42
The fact that luke isn't trying to fool the audience nor glorify the project at it's current state is actually a good honest intention ... bitcoin isn't an altcoin that needs any propaganda, greed or a central figure to succeed 
In fact, the wisest decision ever happened to bitcoin is that satoshi didn't reveal himself to the public for the sake of money and fame and it even got better when he disappeared for good... that geeky self-effacing kind of thinking is the main drive for bitcoin's success
@_date: 2017-07-31 02:19:12
when the price stabilizes and there is a little volatility, and slow gradual increase/decrease over months, that's when people will start using it as money ... that will not happen until a lot of people start to cash out and there is a better redistribution of wealth  
@_date: 2017-07-18 00:50:46
dude it went down at the same rate the 2 days before, that was for the uncertainty behind segwit ... now its clear it wil lock in in the next 3 days and there will be a bigger jump because by then all will be certain that there is no fork in aug 1st
@_date: 2017-07-22 03:54:50

don't buy the fud
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:25:51
or how many belong to the exchanges and mining pools ... in fact most of the people are still holding their assets in exchanges 
@_date: 2017-07-16 02:04:40
Actually we are still in the early adoption phase so the risk is high but the people that could bear the uncertainties will be the most rewarded ones
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:43:19
it is if things remained the same till the end of the next adjustment period
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:19:44
don't you think that a lot of these addresses actually belong to big exchanges

I believe it might be him too :)

here is the interview 
we need a translation though
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:10:29
the first candle is made by a one sell order of more than 1000 BTC which originally was made in bitfinex and triggered some stop loss orders and the rest is just people panicking 
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:17:07
what, its priced @ 2730 right now 
@_date: 2017-07-30 10:57:30
plus the FuD effect regarding the hard fork + being sunday + uncertainty regarding segwit + btc-e shutting down 
also most of the people will dump bch asap and its value will return to btc
@_date: 2017-07-31 05:49:27
most likely BCH is the one that will crash while btc will remain the same or even increase towards sigwet activation and btc's ledgerx options 
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:26:39
there was a few million dollar hack to the 2nd biggest japanese exchange (bitflyer) few days ago .. its trivial but it adds up to the current bear market
edit: sorry its bithumb
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:24:29
Actually, if you studied the markets in the past few days ... a lot  of whales are liquidating large amounts of btc because of that fear ... yet we are still holding strong and bitcoins gets even better distributed and less manipulated
@_date: 2017-07-19 09:33:46
@_date: 2017-07-31 05:55:29
any movement for these coins will cause a significant impact to the btc's price as well because they are thought to be lost forever
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:33:41
a lot of traders are amateurs and uneducated and new to this crypto space ... and yes that was initiated by a single sell order of 1000btc in bitfinex triggering some stop losses 
@_date: 2017-07-12 01:19:35
I'm hodling hard and pretty sure this will end soon... I believe a big percentage of the weak hands (specially those holding 100+ BTC ) already sold their coins... In a short time there will be no one willing to sell in big amounts anymore which would reverse the situation rapidly even way before aug 1st because everyone knows about it already &amp; the most of us already started withdrawing our btc from the exchanges leading to less liquidity in the coming days (i.e: less selling offers)...  
look at the current poloniex market depth, current 1800$+ buying demand is 2.5x of all of the selling offers
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:53:03
poloniex need to clearly state that if they didn't list the bcc they will allow their withdrawal ... coinbase made it clear and allows withdrawal long before the fork but poloniex have a withdrawal limit and they usually await approval for days 
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:45:02
not guaranteed... they will mostly not credit either the lender nor the margin trader
@_date: 2017-06-19 01:16:26
sometimes its instant ... sometimes it "awaits approval" and when it does.. it takes 2-5 days to process
here are some suggestions to lessen the likelihood of delaying the withdrawal 
-use 2FA in your account (this helps a lot)
-use same Ip and device whenever possible
-withdraw to the same wallet
-withdraw in small amounts ( less than 1 BTC at a time )
-be active &amp; involve in exchanges 
@_date: 2017-07-25 03:43:48
it should but not guaranteed as many could try to cash out in the short run and initiate a fud period 
@_date: 2017-07-15 06:06:22
Chances of bitcoin going up from this point is greater than goin down... just ignore the short term declines for the next few days and you will be surprised how fast the price is restored 
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:49:59
the ethereum hype is causing this dip as a lot of btc are sold for eth then btc to usd for quick cash ... 
Some group of people are manipulating the price (mostky ethereum founders) who are throwing who exchange a lot of eth to btc then start manipulating the btc market ... 
If you looked closely at the big trades made today, there was 60,000 eth sold for 6900 btc today @ poloniex ... I believe this is one from one of the main holders of ethereum ... who then used the 6900 btc to manipulate the btc market and in the same time make a lot of ethereum big buying walls to force its price to go up... (I believe all the top markets have been manipulated in the same way) ... they are trying to take over the lead from btc in a really smart way &amp; they could succeed if the current btc issues aren't solved asap

@_date: 2018-12-10 23:41:55
no matter what happens and regardless of the timeframes, adoption will drive the price up whether you like it or not unless the technology fails 
@_date: 2017-07-23 06:01:07
yet the price would have gone way lower if all the 5000 btc were sold without this wall in place
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:54:06
No one knows for sure.... all these outcomes are possible:
1- BTC price will rise by 300$ if the Bcash fall to 0$ 
2- BTC will remain the same as it is now as the majority don't really care about Bcash and anticipate its rapid failure 
3- BTC price will fall by 300$ (the one you mentioned in your post) or get even lower which is the least possible outcome imo 
4- BTC will rise even more than 300$ like what happened in ETH/ETC ... this is also possible given the fact the current fud will fade away and we are stepping into activating segwit and side chains + [the approved ledgerx options which were announced to start in august](   
@_date: 2017-07-29 08:17:51
there is actually no reason for the price to go down anymore as the risk of disruption caused by the fork is minimal plus the chance of getting SW lock-in this period is very high and increasing with each block mined
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:41:16
a lot of people will be fucked up because of this arrogance and the bad decisions... core and miners need to grow up a little and make a change now before its too late  
seriously, wake up guys ... its affecting millions of people &amp; some lives depend on it ... that scaling debate seems ridiculous compared to the storm we are facing in the following days
