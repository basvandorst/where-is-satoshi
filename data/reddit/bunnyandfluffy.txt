Congratulations, you just lost a lot of money.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:35:02
Trade your btc for usdt. That's what I did when it started to dip. 
It will basically lock in you money. Come back when there is a upward trend once again. It's pointless to trade or hodl when the marketcap is going down.
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:52:01
Ok let's do it.... you show first tho.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:55:37
Just mine whatever coin is the most profitable atm...
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:02:38
Don't know about that. But bitcoin is definitely not giving a lot of happiness right now.
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:51:26


No need to specify this. It shows.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:04:27


You are completely delusional.
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:54:32
Sure. Nobody has ever paid taxes on crypto to crypo exchanges tho.
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:04:18
People are completely delusional if they think facebook will choose the bitcoin technology. Bitcoin is just not the right coin.
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:34:29
It would be even worse for bitcoin. Bitcoin is very rare on planet earth, we estimate there is only about 21m of them. However some asteroids can carry as many as 100 billion bitcoin, so mining them would make the btc price go down to almost zero.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:00:19
You can only lose money if you try really hard. Most of the top coins have gone up +400% at least in the last 2 weeks. The rest have either have good progress or at least stability.
Except maybe ltc or bcash but you would be stupid to bet on them. (nvm even them have gone up)
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:24:23
hook me up bro
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:26:28
It's dropped 50% in a few weeks as of now.
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:51:27


...in order to make profit.
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:54:17
You should invest in an alt coin.
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:35:21
Maybe there is a problem with how you talk about it.
If your delivery is perfect, you can convince people even if you deliberately saying stupid things.
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:55:35
Dude leave them alone. I also find it very weird, since literally ANY other alt coin would give more gains. But what can you do.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:43:17
usdt won't go down unless btc literally crashes to 1k overnight.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:40:11
Sure buddy, sure.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:15:26
That's true for everyone, including you. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:40:01
That's not trading, at least in the way he meant. Also he said trading coins, not bitcoin. And also investing bitcoin is probably one of the worst ideas, there are many other coins that are way better investing in.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:03:19
I sold all then bought again 20% more. I fucking love bitcoin crashes.
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:17:31
I have 7842 btc. oh shit i forgot i shouldn't say it!!! pls no hacky me pls
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:13:59
Yea but if bitcoin goes too low, it will just be left behind altogether. The other good coins will definitely rise again stronger than ever tho.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:21:51


Not technically the real problem. If btc goes down and you coin doesn't, that means you get more btc when you will tranfer, and so the same $$ at the end. The transfer to btc is a 0.1% fee or less.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:14:51
I like this because bitcoin is definitely going to die. But I don't want it to die too fast, because it will hurt the good alt coins. So this helps it not dropping too fast : people not realizing they hodling onto a dead coin.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:44:46
To be honest it is definitely a bad idea to buy at an ATH in the cryptocurrency world. Data shows you have high chances of ending up losing money. It's just how things are, and don't take my word for granted, just look at the charts of any top 10 coin.
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:16:04


Can you explain why?
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:33:45
One thing you have to understand is that bitcoin is money. And nobody is responsible for your money but you.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:13:06
why is that shitty? Are you that concerned about coinbase as a company?
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:38:39


You do realize that in every developed country, rich people have a higher tax rate? But let me guess, you are better at economics than every other country or expert in the world.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:40:09


That sounds like bullshit... 
That would make day trading crypto currencies impossible since you are always winning and losing a lot of value while trading, but the winnings would be taxed each time.
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:02:46
Wow definitely salty.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:36:45
dude it's not the charities work to sustain the btc price so you don't lose ur investments...
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:15:10
Yes that's definitely a huge issue. The biggest issue of crypto currency at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:10:25
definitely not zero-sum bro
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:44:52
Why wouldn't you try to save your money? 
If it's illegal then it's just stupid, and they will have to face the financial consequences. That' it, why do you want to bring ethics into this? They're not stealing from homeless people or anything.
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:24:55
I buy 1 btc on coinbase. I transfer it to an exchange platform, and trade however I want. Then I transfer back 3 btc to coinbase and convert it back to $.
I will whatever profit I made since the original investment and that's what is gonna be taxed. They won't care if I traded at some point btc to ltc for example (and won't bother or just can't to track that).
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:33:52
Dude of course in hindsight of course you can tell it would be profitable. 
However the smart move would have been to wait for any of those 3 coins to dip, even a little (which does happen frequently enough).
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:03:57
Doesn't matter what you do on a personal level. The price is going down, I have transferred my btc to alts long ago. Way more reliable.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:37:52
Have you ever found a way to hack a crypto currency? I highly suspect the answer is no.
Even if you really did, how can you expect a random dude investing in a currency to have a background in crypto analysis?
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:25:26
Na most of it is dumping on one of the top 10 coins. Which was definitely a good idea for the last few weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:16:01
He is talking to people who have heard of bitcoin but haven't invested in it.
This would be the dumbest advice you could give to anyone financially invested in it.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:43:37
Monero sucks lmao
@_date: 2018-03-11 00:47:37
dude chill u on reddit
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:59:37
Who are the core devs, and why or how can they claim such a title? 
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:27:20
That would imply BTC dominance stays the same. That's just some quick maffs.
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:22:43
I consider myself as an intellectual as well.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:56:41


Why the fuck would they care about other people still having huge profits while they lose their own money?
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:50:52


Meaning you thought its purpose was to get you money? lol
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:56:43


I mean if you want to get rid of the ASICs you could make it so every day the algorithm is changed. Not very hard to do.
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:39:31
from a mathematical point of view it's very easy
