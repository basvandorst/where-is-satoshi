I've got a bridge to sell for 39 Bitcoins, does anyone want to buy it?
@_date: 2019-09-26 22:17:00
What are you basing that on?

Bitcoin as an idea, great stuff.  
As an investment. Where you put all your nest eggs. Fucking idiotic. And you deserve to be shamed for it. 
Sell it. Put your SMSF back into long term shares. 
If you must, put $50 a week on the dogs, $50 at Melbourne cup time. And stop fucking around with something you have no clue about. 
Your retirement is not something you should be messing around with.  There is a reason a percentage is taken out of your wages each time to put away. It’s for your own benefit, designed and put into law, by those who are more intelligent that you. And trust me, they are more intelligent than you.

Aussie resident here. Agreed, this bloke is a fuckng idiot.
This is why SMSF shouldn’t be allowed. People need to be protected from themselves so they have money in retirement.
The ONLY way to guarantee an income in retirement. Low cost superfund, with low fees. 50% in Aussie Shares, 50% in international.
Return of in and around 9%.
Considering most people earn about 3-4%. Due to fees eating into their nest eggs.
This whole crypto bullshit has warped people into thinking short term investments is a thing.
Well let me tell you sunshine. It’s not.
Only long term.  Anything else is just Ladbrokes.
