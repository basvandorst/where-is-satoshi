This is how the game works. (Copy from the website). I posted it yesterday already, but got the dates wrong. So here it is:
**1 BTC Auction**
This is a Bitcoin Auction Game. The highest bidder will get 1 BTC. There is no minimum bid. Only the highest bidder will get 1 BTC. The lower bids are NOT returned. The auction ends at 15. May 2013 10:00 UTC. All bids received before that time will be valid. If there are two bids of the same value, the one with the earlier transaction date takes preferece. Blockchain.info is used to check validity and bids. Everything is public.
You can increase your bid, anytime before the end of auction, just send your increment to the address again. But MAKE SURE you use the same sender address! Otherwise it is not possible to determine that you are the same bidder. After the end of the auction, the highest bidder, will automatically be sent 1 BTC to their sender address. (Make sure your bitcoin client allows you to receive bitcoins at your sender address, you can test this at satoshi dice). 1 day after the auction a new auction is automatically started. For transparency, all previous auctions and winning addresses will be listed on this site.
End of auction: 15. May 2013 10:00 UTC
Minimum bid: 0 BTC
Use this address to place your bid:  [13NaHmSyhBF4cWJdcLVtidjXPZTEebK8pK](
**10 BTC Auction**
This is the Auction for 10 BTC.
End of auction: 20. May 2013 10:00 UTC
Minimum bid: 0.25 BTC
Use this address to place your bid:  [1KHXHA9BYkBzdkbHfQJtmmFhZBY36Htt9u](
**Highest Bid Takes All Auction**
In this auction the highest bidder takes the full amount that has been transfered to the address at the time of the auction end.
End of auction: 20. May 2013 10:00 UTC
Minimum bid: 0 BTC
Use this address to place your bid:  [17zHwY8i3nRYKmPy17mLZvCsT67KENF2Wj](
Make sure you understand the rules of this auction. Only the highest bid wins anything. The lower bids will be used to sponsor this service.
If you have any questions, or need support write at btcauction
If you accidentally used different sender addresses to increase your bid send a email before the end of the auction. You will have to proove that both sender addresses actually belong to you. After that the bids will be merged and the merge will be noted on this website.
The date was set wrong, it is fixed now. Thanks for writing
