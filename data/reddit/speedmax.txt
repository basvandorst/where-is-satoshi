Use tradeblocks chart as reference, so whatever their setting is.

Something is really strange.. there are over 3000 transactions and avg 340BTC each. 
IF you follow this transaction then you will see large amount of BTC being forwarded so many times. (scrambled)

It begins...

Patience! 
Satoshi never promise Bitcoin would Always be Free &amp; Instant.
Give it until this weekend so backlogs in mempool to come down. Or recommend Fullnode to upgrade their RAM so we can fit more transaction in memory.
Memory is cheaper than Disk in 2016 right?

Yeah right, So more people (third-world) can DDOS Bitcoin network with low transactions (&lt; $1M) as if those $2000 - $200K transactions (spam) are not enough to "Denial of Service" for hours to confirm

Also Genesis Mining supports both Classic (or 2MB), plus we should chat.
Basically, agree-and-disagree on both side.

I am all for democratising Bitcoin for the masses to reach it's potential, but the network is stuck.

Yep, also you can spin up a bunch of nodes to optimise network routes to earn fees. I can see a lot of staked nodes driving fees and latency down over time

Did they just copy the "Longest valid chain" line from Satoshi's whitepaper?
Come up! This is 2017 instead of 2009, It's Core running Bitcoin, not Satoshi any more.
