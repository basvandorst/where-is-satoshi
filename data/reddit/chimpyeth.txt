Agreed. The problem here though is the huge losses that many have experienced, especially the average joes that jumped on board in the last month or two as crypto hit the mainstream society.
Those are the people (particularly the wealthier, more privileged, more resource-rich) that will complain the loudest and push for severe regulation, legal issues, lawsuits, etc... you name it.
This isn't just crypto nerds losing money and realizing the technology has huge potential, like after Mt. Gox. This is now the rich senator's son that learned about bitcoin from a drunk friend at Harvard, and now that he lost 60% of the six-figure loan his dad gave him, the whole crypto community will have to pay in the form of dealing with more regulations, backlash, legal challenges, and so on. Same goes for the many, many other average, everyday working folks that thought crypto would pay off their mortgage by March.
Basically, this time around is more concerning because CNBC, the SEC, the South Korean gov't, soccer moms, Harvard elites, etc... are losing money--not just crypto junkies that realize the technology has growing pains.

You're welcome.

That would be a limit order, not a stop. Big difference.
Stop would mean you have a position and if the price drops to a certain price, sell the position to *stop* further losses (assuming it keeps falling).
Limit means *buy* at a certain price target that you set.

No really--you're welcome. If humanity as a whole can become smarter, even one fact at a time, that would benefit everyone.
I hope you have a great day and good luck with Coinbase :)
