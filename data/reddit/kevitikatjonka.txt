Everyone would be incentivized to vote for shitty and unpopular candidates, and whoever was unlucky enough to vote for a winner would be disproportionately taxed to cover up for all those who have reduced taxes.

I believe that this point would be adequately addressed by the speaker had the video continued. Venezuela is absolutely capable of paying all its debts held in Bolivar, by definition. How ever, as its inflation diverges, it would not be able to take on new debts, which is a very bad position to be in. Practically speaking, at some point, the state would be forced to take on debts in other currencies and would not be able to devalue those currencies to clear the corresponding debts.

Inflation is measured in proportion to total value. Besides, if you have an issue with the scale, would you accept inflation if produced by a small central bank? Or perhaps we can reimplement currencies minted by single banks like in the good old days. It makes me wonder, what do you consider to be the optimal rate of inflation/deflation for a currency?

By that logic, the farmer shouldn't raise more cattle, the painter shouldn't paint more paintings, and the bitcoin miner shouldn't solve more hashes. All who can create anything of value can contribute to the reduced value of what they create.

I'm not particularly well versed in law, especially not US law, but I can confidently say that it at least doesn't apply to the Swedish Crown in Sweden. 
Regarding the taking it further part, I don't feel as if I can contribute to a discussion as it seems to come down to personal opinion. I simply agree with the general consensus that a small amount of inflation is beneficial to society. Whether or not to agree is entirely subjective.

That's not evidence, that's just you talking.
I have literally no idea what your so-called evidence has anything to do with the willingness of the public to purchase a bond from the state. You mentioned two examples of governments who practically defaulted as a result of being unable to clear its debts, and it is undoubtedly true that a state which controls the minting of a currency in which all its debts are issued can avoid a similar situation. How ever, it holds no relevance to the value of the bond that state may issue. What good does it do the state to pay back all its loans if it will never take a loan again.
The examples of the US and the UK do not in any way account for or explain their respective currencies inflation rates. Each loans interest rate is determined by the free market judging the likeliness of being paid back in less value than loaned. The state debt is a measurement of the willingness to accept a debt from the state.
Lastly, while a state can always pay of its debts by instituting a very high degree of inflation, it may not be able to pay for its other expenses, such as its public sector, and thus, may default as a result.

While I completely understand and sympathize with your point, I find it a bit incomplete. They're not diluting the value of anything besides what they themselves are capable of creating. It would be a bit like saying Picasso stole every time he painted something.

Inflation means a reduction of purchasing power measured in a currency. All goods and services, including mediums of exchange (such as currencies) have a value dictated by the free market. That value corresponds to the supply and demand. Because of this, a currency's value will decrease in proportion to its increase.
There are currently six countries experiencing high inflation, if defined as 30%. If the definition of high inflation is extended to 15%, there are 16 countries. All countries except for some very few experience some degree of inflation, as a low inflation is preferable to any alternative.
I hope I've answered your questions. If you want to learn anything more about inflation, feel free to ask, I'll gladly help!

Despite its name, the central bank is not a bank like all other banks. It is an extension of the state, and its authority is derived from the citizens. Why would the institution which mints a currency not posses the right to mint more of it?

Why would there be a bitcoin exchange rate at an airport? So that you know the exchange rate for Bitcoinland when you travel there?
@_date: 2019-03-13 18:47:42
There is, as far as I know, no requirement to accept a currency. In fact, states tend to be the only institution which has a legal requirement to accept payments in a specific currency. Which ever medium of exchange a private individual or business choose to transact in, they inevitably accept the limitations that come with it. Whether that be fiat or picassos doesn't matter.

I challenge you to go to any country and be a tourist using only bitcoin. Good luck.
Also, the great thing about bitcoin is there is no reason to purchase it at an airport, or any other physical location. So why would you?

Okay, I know I am a bit late to the thread, but if anyone is still lurking around the newer comments, can you explain to me what the hell the point of Bitcoin is?
I can't be a good medium of exchange and investment at the same time, at least not in perpetuity. It makes sense that a lot of cryptofans have different priorities, but I for one do not see a 200% value increase as a positive thing. Why are entire bitcoin communities in constant celebration of a value increase that is inherently unsustainable? Just like you can't have your cake and eat it too, you can't buy your lambo and re-institute the "gold" standard at the same time.

If you agree with above statement, which I assume you do, would you consider to offload the cost of a house (or other investment) to someone with more capital in exchange for a part of the profits you stand to gain?
If yes: Congratulations, you've just taken a loan from a bank.

What is your definition of a modern bank and state? I'm not very familiar with the early concepts of banks, but the first central bank was established directly by a state.
@_date: 2019-10-29 14:31:53
What you're saying doesn't add up. The central bank is responsible for the creation of a currency. The state controls the central bank. By definition, the state controls the creation of its currency.

Banks are bound by law to cover a proportion of their exposure. Thus, they are not able to print money indefinitely.

I love these types of discussions. Especially your first remark.
But here is my take on it. Cryptocurrencies won't replace banks, they will replace the central bank. Or at least its original purpose.
Currently, banks possess a substantial amount of capital for obvious reasons. If bitcoin ever becomes widespread, it will inevitably change the relationship the population has with the bank. The advantage is that you do not need a bank to perform your everyday transactions and hold your savings. The disadvantage, how ever, is that banks still perform a crucial function in modern society; loans. For many people, a loan is a necessary evil. In most cases, large loans are reserved for housing, but from my understanding, also for other expensive yet necessary products, such as cars. 
I am fairly certain banks tend to make a lot of money from the interest on their loans. This is still, and probably will forever be, a lucrative business. No matter the currency. Secondly, large scale use of bitcoin will not necessarily prevent inflation. Inflation creates an incentive to invest your currency in something which will give you a long-term profit, thus avoiding the negative consequences of inflation. Now you might point out that bitcoin probably won't suffer from inflation, in fact, it will suffer from deflation, since it is by its nature ever increasingly scarce. Unfortunately for us, this is a very bad thing, because we need investments to fund loans. If banks were made obsolete, society would grind to a halt. Average people rely on banks to start small scale businesses, buy housing and buying cars so they can drive to work. 
It is easy to see banks are the prime evil, but banks are nothing but the collection of a nations savings put to good use. The money you pay from a bank go to many things, not just the banks profits and the salaries of its workers, but also to risk. And risk will never disappear. 
This is a very fascinating discussion, I wish my friends were more into the subject so I could have it with them. 
I must say though, your second point is very impressive. Naturally I have thought of bitcoins ability to make you independent from a potentially malicious state, but I haven't thought about its ability to make you independent from *other* states. 
Lastly, I am glad I live in a country where the basis of the democratic process is not digital. I doubt the blockchain will ever change that, but perhaps some day. It will be interesting to see. Especially if we could conceive a way to elect MP's on a more frequent basis, such as a monthly/bi-yearly updated ledger which would make parliament less prone to ignore its constituents. How ever, I have no idea how we could create an incentive for people to verify the ledger, as there is seemingly no way to allow for PoW/PoS to guarantee fair decentralization. The more I think about it, the more it seems that you are suggesting a cryptographic democratic process, which to me is nothing short of manipulatable.
