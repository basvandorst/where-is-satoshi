Sounds really scummy. With the original Megaupload and Mega he was making a profit on filesharing, but at least there was no significant incentive for people to use them over BItTorrent. If the new Megaupload catches on, I can see this putting a dent in BitTorrent usage, forcing downloaders to pay per download and fucking everyone over when it inevitably gets shut down or commandeered again.
Kind of ironic, because the goal of Bitcoin is decentralization.

Mega is encrypted, but copyright holders can (and do) submit publicly-shared links to files they own the license to and get them taken down that way. Only way to keep that from happening is to only share the links with people you trust.

The price goes up when people think the price will go up, and they have a massive interest in the price going up. Any "predictions" they make about the price are an attempt at a self-fulfilling prophecy and completely invalid.

If and when Bitcoin usage becomes completely mainstream, it will be because whatever fad wallet people are using completely hides anything related to cryptography, and 99% of users won't know what a hash or signature are.

Generally whether someone is willing to pay a ransom for data is pretty much binary. 99% of people won't be willing to pay at all, but the 1% who are willing to pay at all probably had a whole corporate NAS hit and would be willing to pay 5 figures. From the ransomer's perspective, no reason to play around with asking only for $1k when most of your victims will either not pay at all or pay whatever you ask.

Bitcoin is incredibly unstable. Unless you plan to spend it immediately after buying it, don't put any money into Bitcoin that you can't afford to lose. If you're planning to put away £100 per week, maybe put £90 into savings and £10 into Bitcoin, or better yet, maybe split the £10 between Bitcoin and Ethereum or something. "Don't put all your eggs in one basket" as it were.
If you buy a small amount frequently, it's important to find a seller that makes its profit through selling at a price slightly higher than market value without fees, as opposed to a seller that sells at market value but charges a set transaction fee, because with a seller who charges a set transaction fee, smaller transactions like £10 might lose you a significant amount of money in fees. Alternatively, put away £10 every week and then buy £40 worth every 4 weeks.

Free software*
@_date: 2016-01-17 16:46:02


I have no opinion on classic or XT or whatever other forks people are using, but "copying while claiming 'we're better'" is literally the point. When Oracle bought MySQL, did the creators of the new MariaDB make sure to state that "well, Oracle probably has some good ideas, and MySQL is probably going to always be better"? No, their entire project is founded on "fuck Oracle, fuck every piece of software they've destroyed including MySQL".
The point of free software ("""open source""") is that the software is a fluid thing that anyone can use or modify in any way at any time for any reason. "Well, but if all you do is make this one change that I don't like, you should be ashamed of yourself" isn't how it works.

This has nothing to do with bundled malware, it's about exploitation. They don't need to sneak a backdoor into your operating system ISOs, there are plenty of accidental ones they can discover and abuse. This isn't specific to governments, individuals do this all the time too, the only thing that's significant about CIA is the sheer number of them makes it basically impossible that they'll all get fixed at once.

They're not intrinsically related or significant, 1BTC and 1 troy ounce are just the de-facto "whole units" of each (unless you're a nation state, in which case metric tons are probably more useful than troy ounces, but that's irrelevant to individuals).

Whether or not the source code is available has nothing to do with this, other than making vulnerabilities easier to prevent (which doesn't matter if they already have exploits for existing vulnerabilities) and maybe making it somewhat easier to clean up the rubble if they get caught after they've done as they please with whichever systems they please.

It was like $700 3 days ago and now it's over $900. It's not quire as bad as 2013, but it's absolutely not completely genuine and sustainable. There is probably some genuine growth, and it'll probably crash a little higher than it did in 2013, but don't pretend a 30% increase overnight is just normal, gradual, slight growth.

The hardfork creates two different blockchains with a shared past but divergent future. If the fork happens at block x, any coins that were in a given address at block x-1 will also be in that address on both chains at blocks x+1, assuming you don't spend them in that period of 2 blocks.
The private key you already have for your coins on the Bitcoin chain will also allow you to spend Segwitx2 coins from the same address once the fork happens. How this works depends on your clients, but as long as you hold your own keys, there will always be a way to access the coins.
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:46:02
I believe so, all hardforks should basically work the same way like this.

[Already a thing]( It can be useful for preventing anyone from finding out that there's a message in the first place, but it's not a substitute for actual crypto and you should encrypt your message (with a real algo like AES, Twofish, Serpent, or a one-time pad, not your hypothetical "they will have no idea what algorithm you used if you delete the sourcecode" algo) before using steganography.

Nazi Germany made a cryptosystem much more advanced than anyone on this subreddit would ever dream of making, and it's been broken since before Nazi Germany fell. It's not 1300 anymore, modern codebreaking is very advanced and very automated; your "cipher" wouldn't hold up against NSA for more than a fraction of a second.
If you actually think "take the message and switch some stuff around a bit and then be extra super duper sure to delete the source code :\^)" is a secure approach, all I can say is I suggest you make sure every message you "encrypt" with this algorithm is very pro-government.

It's not so much that, it's just that to most people "cryptocurrencies" and "Bitcoin" are the same thing, so when someone gets caught installing Monero miners on 500 library computers or something, most people only see or care about the vague or inaccurate headline and their minds file it under "Bitcoin news".

Not sure what you're smoking. The Constitution party believes the US should be a Christian theocracy, believes state and local governments should criminalize homosexuality, and opposes all forms of welfare. Pirates are explicitly anticapitalist and fairly similar to the Green party, but with more of a technological focus than an environmental.
They're basically Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders, respectively. They have no overlaps in beliefs whatsoever, with the sole exception of both being against the Patriot act. Don't assume just because they kinda like Bitcoin that they automatically agree with all your shitty beliefs.

Ulbricht took in well over $100 million in BTC through running Silk Road, which is probably at least 1000x what it cost him to run it.
Yes, drugs should be legal. Yes, life in prison for is highly excessive, and he should probably be pardoned. But to even mention his name in the same sentence as Snowden's and Manning's is disgusting.

Profit generally negates "goodness". The only difference between a food bank and a Walmart supermarket is that Walmat makes an obscene amount of profit from what they do, whereas a food bank is a charity.
Just because Walmart provides food and people need food to survive doesn't make Walmart altruistic.
Silk Road is a Walmart, not a food bank.
