Too bad you can't repurpose the old bitcoin miners themselves. Probably have a better chance of finding an alien then I do a bitcoin with these old block eruptors.

So there is no way to do refunds in bitcoin without leaving yourself open to currency manipulation?

Mount Gox was an Exchange.
An exchange is a place where you can buy and sell bitcoins in exchange for fiat (local currency like yen, dollars, pounds).
Mount Gox was the largest of these exchanges in terms of trading volume (though probably not for the last few months).
They have either lost or stolen a huge number of bitcoins that did not all belong to them, most belonged to the people buying and selling.
There were rumors of problems for months yet some people either could not or did not withdraw their BTC or fiat and have now (to the best of our knowledge) lost them.
Since bitcoin is not FDIC (or similarly) insured, that is a WHOLE lot of value that has simply (again to the best of our knowledge) vanished.
What did it do to bitcoin?...I am not sure anyone can really answer that.  This is all rather a new thing in civilization so there is no playbook to go by.  IMHO, bitcoin will quickly rebound.  Only a deaf-blind-gimp couldn't see Gox was having issues.  The people who lost money I feel sorry for them, but if I went into a real world bank that had broken windows, a security guard snorting meth, and a bank teller who told me I could put my money in but it might take 8 months to a year for a withdrawl to complete, yet I still put my money in there just becuase they had a slightly higher interest rate then everyone else...Well maybe I shouldn't be too surprised when the cashier gives the security guard a quick handy so her midget lesbian lover can sneak in and empty the vault!

Hell yes! I think I can live off gyft cards and such for a while!  Well I wouldn't say my life would change all that much.  Would be a fantastic opportunity to take my regular salary and invest heavily for retirement, maybe I'll be able to pull that off a decade or two early now.

Can you really call it "predicted" when in fact Mike Judge actually did travel through time and took notes, then shot Idiocracy documentary style?! He merely changed some of the names to places so it wouldn't be TOO obvious.

Probably easier for them to just take the site down rather than not execute all the sales orders.  One thing I have learned from reading this sub is to never depend on Coinbase when you have a really low or a really high value.

Possibly because I already posted the local story hours ago.

I wouldn't mind receiving a portion of my salary in BTC, but the majority would still have to be paid in USD.  Until everyone I have to pay (landlord, utilities, fuel, etc.) start taking BTC themselves, it just doesn't make sense.  Maybe in areas like Silicon Valley I could see this happening, but I'm lucky if I can find a hamburger stand locally to actually spend my BTC on!

I very much doubt it.  At 120,000 total downloads, that is a pretty small fraction of total iPhone/iPad users.

Sounds like it works just like a Visa/Mastercard debit card linked to a checking account.  Only difference is your checking account is filled with Bitcoins instead of US Dollars (or whatever your fait of choice is). Vendor authorizes the charge as fiat, xapo handles the bitcoin conversion.

Is it the market value of the waffles at the time of filing the paperwork?...This is why I should not try to hold intelligent conversations before breakfast. My apologies.

Easy yes, but you pay a premium for that speed with all those fees. Probably better off using localbitcoin.  Also do your math VERY carefully or you will wind up with either leftover L$ or USD that is too small to exchange and basically sits useless in your account until your next purchase or you request a cash out (which I believe has MORE fees).
