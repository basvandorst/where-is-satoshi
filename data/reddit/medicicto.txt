Yeah, that's us. 
If you look at the asset definition URL you can see that we are hosting the meta data.

Our plan has always been to have the Medici platform,  use multiple cryptographic technologies based on the use case. This use case was well suited to Colored Coins. We expect to release additional financial instruments on different platforms soon.
We are really excited about this news.

Missing SSL certificate on the meta data....should be resolved shortly.

This is not a public security, and has different regulatory requirements, mainly Qualified or Accredited Investors. 
We expect to see publicly traded securities in the not so distant future.

Not sure I understand what you are asking, but the issuance quantity is determined by the issuer...and managed by the t0 platform. 
As a side note, OSD is denominated in $1.00 increments. So there are currently 25,000,000 OSD coins.

I think it is a really great sign for Bitcoin that there are multiple choices for this. We obviously have worked closely with Counterparty in the past and have looked closely at number of solutions. 
The short answer is we didn't need some of the more complex features for this launch. 
Private debt is a relatively simple use case.  We are also working on some really complex use cases that will leverage different technologies. Going to be a fun.

The SEC has to approve a public securities offering, so unless you are an accredited investor, no. 
But as soon as they do...

Medici is evaluating all crypto technologies.

Well said.

The Medici platform is intended to support multiple blockchains/crypto-ledgers. We want to work with the solution which best fits the requirements specific to our use-cases.

Adam I wish you, Robby and Evan the best, but you probably shouldn't fact check for Medici.

Medici will support multiple cryptotechnologies....counterparty may eventually be one of them, but that is far from certain. Trading platforms have a very specific set of requirements and we will be using the best of the available protocols/technologies.

The application of crypto-tech is much more interesting for medici than any particular currency.

Security, performance, and throughput are some of the considerations when looking at cryptoexchanges. 
We remain interested in technologies (including the bitcoin blockchain) that might efficiently enable transparent and distributed securities settlement.

I am leading the Medici work at Overstock. Medici is still evaluating crypto technologies. We continue discussions with Counterparty, however, we do not plan to limit our platform to a single blockchain, ledger or protocol. 
The long-term future of crypto securities will undoubtedly include multiple exchanges. Medici will enable trading where ever efficient and qualified exchanges can be created.
