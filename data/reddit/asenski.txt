Bingo! Makes sense - it's two equal size transactions.

Bytemaster is capable of dreaming. And I can respect that. But BitShares is not capable of 100k tps, that is only a theory at the moment and pending major version upgrade.

Since the data is encrypted, couldn't you just upload it multiple times encrypted with a different key each time?

Wells Fargo is the worst bank ever. They will report anything slightly out of the ordinary and put you in ChexSystems. I would sue the hell out of them.
Couple years ago my girlfriend and I made a mistake once when depositing a check via ATM, and they said, that's it, we are shutting you down and reporting you. I was like WTF. Had to talk to the manager of the bank in person for an hour to alleviate the problem.

If you have solutions for them, they can give you % of the asset as a bounty.

Check out Pangea - they have a super slick UI (look for it on YouTube), perhaps join their efforts?
And this is their asset, it's listed on NXT:

When you look at altcoins that have "halfing" happen much quicker and at some point it's no longer economically sound to "mine", "forge" or whatever the process is, you expect the price would skyrocket, instead, they just collapsed.
Consider that Bitcoin could just be dethroned by some better protocol that doesn't waste as much electricity. My point is - don't go all in.
Yes, Bitcoin is very useful for remittance and will become more so as time goes on. But for the most part this utility doesn't require people to hang onto the Bitcoin. So, technically Bitcoin could be be very valuable even at $1 and still provide remittance well over $10B/year if most users never hold it but rather convert/spend it.

Right. Let's flag anyone making decent money as risky account holder. How dare they be successful!
It's one thing to refuse the transaction, completely different thing to report you to ChexSystems, which means that person may not be able to open a bank account for 7 years (knew someone who had to cash checks in person for that long). A bit extreme just based on a suspicion isn't it? Granted we don't have the full story.

Peter just wishes people stock up on Gold instead of crypto.
Here's what you can't do with Gold:
* you can't store it cheaply in large quantities
* you can't send it across the world in minutes in large quantities
I'm sure there's more.

Am I the only one who finds these two features a bit contradicting?

I'd suggest park it in cold storage, using deterministic wallet based on password she writes down and keeps in safe place.
Also check WarpWallet:

I was referring to the current system as in - central banks trickling down the printed supply, not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-09 04:27:21
True, in a sense, the monetary system operates very much like a cult.

I think a bottom up system that rewards honest work in place of "proof of work" could really stand a chance of mass adoption. Right now we have a top-down system, where money gets printed at the central banks and then distributed in a trickle-down fashion and we then call that "inflation". It is archaic and borderline feudalism.
Of course it would be much harder to accomplish in a crypto asset, but I think it's possible.
