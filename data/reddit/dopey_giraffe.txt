Yes.

I kind of wish the internet still looked like this.  And this isn't nostalgia or anything, I'm only 24.

I'm thinking the initial panic and shock (of something we all knew was coming).  It'll pass.  Don't be one of those idiots and panic sell.
@_date: 2014-09-23 16:27:39
That's not the point. Were talking about adults that you're treating like children.  Why implement all those rules?
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:34:27
Really? Gox again?  In this case halting trading seemed to be the smart thing to do.  Thanks for explaining.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:11:31
Holy shit.  I expected the complete opposite.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:56:38
Remember that topic about the corrupt Chinese officials driving the price up?
...I do.
@_date: 2014-02-21 00:12:12
True, but the constant slide downward is making me a little more nervous each day.  I'm not over-invested or anything, but I'd still rather not lose my money.

Buy if you can spare, hold for sure.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:21:35
Nope, gone.

I bought in on coinbase right before the initial Gox crash.  I've been buying incrementally since then.  I'm at 2.68 BTC currently worth $1509 that I spent $1915 on.  Not exactly the results I'm looking for and I've had it with how annoying Gox has been with their announcements crashing bitcoin over and over.

He didn't really say anything, which was nice.  He just asked questions.
@_date: 2014-08-25 13:52:25
Well, he also said Mark went completely AWOL and provided zero support.  So... yeah, the service wasn't good enough.  
@_date: 2014-02-14 17:15:51
Thank you, Professor.

Dorkus? Dorkus Asswhistle?
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:36:17
Meh.  I got a little buzzed and I'm good.  I closed Preev, that helped.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:53:04
I meant the 4/13 crash.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:36:14
The Gox drama is finally over.  They shut down their twitter, halted trading, and now just took their website offline.  They're apparently re-branding, according to unsubstantiated documents (that have accurately predicted everything that has happened so far).  
Bitcoin isn't dead, just wait a bit.

He catches lightening in a bottle every now and then.  I can't stand the guy and I agree with literally 0% of what he says, but I enjoyed this video.
@_date: 2014-10-06 21:15:47
Yea no one cares how smart you are.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:16:55
What were the circumstances of the 4/13 crash?
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:30:23
No help desk at support.mtgox.com
There is no help desk configured at this address. This means that the address is available and that you can claim it at 
is what it says for me.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:42:11
That draft thing that describes MtGox's post-insolvency plan people have been posting.  You'll find it if you search the comments.  People have posted it like 8 times in this thread so far.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:00:41
How much did you lose?
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:17:24
No.  The DDOS will end, Gox will be resolved, the market already adapted to China and will adapt to Russia, and everything will chug on like it usually does.  Buy in and profit on the recovery like I am.
I'm not saying it will never die, but this won't be it.  Unlike gold, bitcoins are just numbers on a computer.  If it disappears in an exchange (Gox), it's gone forever.  
*Or don't buy in.  Personally, whenever someone gave me direct bitcoin advice on reddit, the EXACT opposite happened.  For example, someone advised me to buy in at $1250 "because that's the holiday special!!", and a few days later it crashed.  Glad I didn't listen.

Are you Italian?

That was seized too.

Jfc apples to oranges man.

This a stupid question, please bear with me:
If I transfer five coins to my wallet via coinbase, then follow your steps and melt my computer and kill my relatives, I can still use the seed words to retrieve the five coins if I install the wallet somewhere else?
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:49:05
@_date: 2017-07-17 02:51:40
That was an incredibly slow reaction to a bear charge.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:07:21
Less than 24 hours after people called me stupid and downvoted me for suggesting bitcoin was extremely inflated, that I should buy now, and that the value would only go up, the first China crash happened.
Now I pay attention to this subreddit to do the opposite of what they say.
