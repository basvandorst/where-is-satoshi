Wow, that's some history to drop.

A contributing factor to Overstock's missed target could have been... there are reasons most of their stuff didn't sell the first time around? Once other mechants came on board Overstock in spite of being first isn't such an attractive retailer anymore.

You may not have an interest in crapware, but crapware has an interest in you. Packages deviating from upstream happens in many Distros. At least with Gentoo/Funtoo portage and BSD ports you get the choice to be diligent in avoid the crap that sneaks in.

This is a thing. Taking as close to legal max US dollars with you on the trip in cash would be helpful. The Bitcoin scene in Argentina isn't as developed as some people might suggest 
Buying pesos at the blue rate is going to be good, but through the trip you will probably want to keep some of your dollars unconverted to pesos for emergencies.

Well this article links two spanish language news pieces on the raid. It's hard to say though that the Spanish government wouldn't have it's own motives for surpressing things like Dark Wallet and libertarianism.

Debian has its own insanity, most distros do. You've got to learn the quirks though. Gentoo ports often have weird flags that deviate from upstream enabled by default. Many other Distros have deviations like this in their binary packages.

Well, proof of stake, but why in the hell ought a proof of stake system require... hardware sold as analogous to mining hardware. Nothing to hash at all.

To be fair it could also simply be that they want to build a platform of their own.

Well, for businesses that just want another payment option to offer retail customers BitPay is what it is. I'm glad BitPay is really spending to get attention to Bitcoin, but I worry that all of this spending might not be all that sustainable.

There' nothing available on that point in the court documents publically available. Because he plead guilty the best hope on that point is to maybe write him a letter once he settles into prison and ask, if his plea agreement even allows him to answer.

Well weight favors people who bet earlier. The way open mutual betting works is that the odds If BTC fails to rally and you win, you get more than someone who bet they same amount later. What you can't ever count on though is winning 21 BTC on an 0.1 bet. There's enough Bitcoin out there that someone is going to come along and correct the odds as time passes.

Or if you denominate your accounts in Bitcoin.

Older than BetMoose, draws in far more bets by value.

Pretty much this. Also the database of incoming bets is open. You can even see the transaction that sent 1000 BTC for that first yes bet:

I doubt they would do it given that in a post-Gox world this sort of wound is grave. It might take a while to die, but BitStamp is effectively dead.

Well, depends on how much you care to get familiar with betting in this way. For an informed bettor with money to move their position as time goes on it can be great fun. It's just if your longshot bet becomes incredibly likely don't expect it to pay like it is still a longshot.
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:28:08
Indeed, and if the likelyhood of the outcomes changes over time it is exactly the right thing to do. If the giant pile of money on Yes becomes increasingly less likely to win, people are going to throw lots of money on No. Whether it is the same person or different people throwing money on No doesn't much matter.
This is just how healthy markets work. They correct themselves.

Hard to be sure he bet himself, but because of the time weight the earlier bettors are still pretty much guarenteed to win something.
It isn't a kind of betting to go into blindly ar recklessly. It is a functioning market much like any other market. The platform takes their one percent and provides a safe place for people to price risk.
