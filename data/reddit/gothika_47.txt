Just saw your edit. How expesive is WU? Is it less than 9% because suggested a site that will eat up 9% of the transaction.

That might work. Also i have a question! Mind buying 1.9 instead of 1.5 since thats all i have (i tough i had 3 but it turns out i sold 1 a long time a go)

Only 3. I was farming with a fast gaming PC so i could make some easy money but the difficulty killed farming for me lol.

So i can sell my bitcoins trough bitfloor and get my money in my bank acc? Is the site secure?
@_date: 2013-04-04 11:16:53
I don't have a dwolla account how long does it take to set up? Also i can assure you im not a scamer i just want to sell them and get it over with. :)
@_date: 2013-04-04 11:25:27
How large is this large fee? Since i want to sell only 3 how much money will i lose?
@_date: 2013-04-04 11:24:53
Im currently trying to understand how localbitcoins works since i found people in my country trying to buy some.
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:01:34
Found a guy at my town but still this sounds shady as fuck. I think he should give me the money and ill send him the coins and i just leave lol.
@_date: 2013-04-04 11:11:48
What other options do i have? Can some site send them directly to my bank account (debit card)?
@_date: 2013-04-04 11:13:05
3 bitcoins. I didint sell them because i farmed them after i sold my fist batch and i saved them just for fun. Now im really need money and these 3 bitcoins cost more than my current salary lol.
