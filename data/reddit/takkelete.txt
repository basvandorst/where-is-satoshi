Well I encourage you to treat them as such, monetary loss happens. Spend some time doing you and not weighed down (the most I ever lost in BTC was 6 so I can't say I've been in the same boat, but it helped a lot once I let it go) by the loss. Whether that means moving on from your SO or making it work is up to you, but try not to let it sour you as a person

It is relatively easy to use coinbase (assuming you are in the US) and the fees are pretty minimal. They have a slight delay to get your coins, but if you are planning to buy and hold they are your best option.
After that, dealing in cash on localbitcoins is a pretty solid option.
Either way you are going to be paying less than Paypals 2.7% fee

I read that you normally carry the 40R range. By any chance do you think you would ever have something in 36R? (I know I'm kind of small)

consider stamp finex or coinbase depending on needs/location

I'm going to assume that the OP here was acting with good intentions. However, if should be noted that this transaction is most likely a scam.
Paypal can be reversed, BTC LTC cannot. In no case does the seller of a crypto come out ahead here. There is little to no reason to use paypal over localbitcoins or direct bank deposit, even if you are not willing to use an exchange.

Yes but I don't think he would have sold over 10K in a single transaction. Most people are aware of the legality there

Does this sound like entrapment to anyone? I'm in no way tied to a law education but I'm fairly certain it applies here?

This is probably the way to go. The site will almost have to give in to shipping to you if they risk losing their payment gateway provider due to shady practices. 
Consider filing a BBB claim as well. Standard rules apply for any e-commerce business. This is not a fly-by-night-wild-west-bitcoin screnario

It might be better to reach out to the press earlier, they'll have to divert their efforts to preserving an image in the media which will likely be fairly tricky given that they're actively attacking a successful charity.

I'll build a thunderclap in about an hour. If the OP could include it as part of the original post we should be able to get a lot of support for it.

Not sure if you are still around answering. Given the current market, how viable is it to buy a relatively large amount of bitcoin? I managed to convince a small hedge fund (under 500 million) to convert some of their legacy inflation hedges (mostly gold mining companies) to bitcoin. It took them almost three weeks to move only .6% of their total assets into bitcoin at what they considered an acceptable price. 
Obviously, I think this is one of the largest problems with Wall Street adoption, do you believe that the current exchanges with their relatively large depth tables (compared to stocks at least) can sustain institutional demand or would they need an alternative vehicle/a much larger market cap?
PS I ask because I assumed your original vehicle you were suggesting was going to target smaller infusions (&lt;$100,000)
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:59:21
I think I agree with the top comment that it might be a better over done if we try something like that. 
Thunderclap is an app that allows all forms of social media to post at once as opposed to ongoing posts. It creates a large social impression net and can get something trending. I think the most succesful one to date was for the ubuntu edge

X-POST from my comment on the other page:
I have tried to pick up a freedom pop service twice. My experience with them has been worse than any company I have ever purchased from (think BFL level).
I ordered one of their phones. Given that they were relatively new I expected a little bit of a delay. 25 days later, I called customer support and found out that they backordered the phone (no notification on either web page or email about backorders). Customer support said they would ship in a week.
Fifteen days later I initiated a chargeback on my card as 40 days seemed a bit excessive and I was nearing the limit to initiate a chargeback. The phone shipped three days later. I called customer support again (note at this point there number was no longer listed on the site and had to be found again through a site that tracks contact numbers). Even with me offering to stop the chargeback, they were unwilling to activate the phone. I now have a brick.
My sister ordered one as well. Phone came in 37 days (hers came unactivated as well despite no chargeback). She was able to get it activated over three separate support calls. During the time between when she ordered the phone and when she received it, the price of the plan went up around ~10 a month (no contract no pricing guarantee).
I would STRONGLY advise against doing business with them.

Due to the relative difficulty of gox they ended up moving their ~1.5 million in through localbitcoin and coinbase over the course of three weeks. It was not pretty and eventually they had to accept a price higher than their target average buy in.

Someone can correct me if I am wrong here. But they are not connected in any way (with the semi-exception that the prices you see on coinbase will correlate to the other exchanges due to coinbase being a broker for the other exchanges). That being said the exchanges should always track within 2% of each other (fees cause this number) because if they did not it would be possible to arbitrage the exchanges. Mtgox is an exception due to the lack of liquidity when selling bitcoins for cash.

There are significant delays in the US due to AML requirements. So if you use anything that requires a bank account you'll run into the delays. Coinbase offers an instant buy (10 BTC for most) that might serve your needs.

Most competent IT in my field (systems) in Houston make 60K, even without a degree (assuming you have the skill). The request for linux experience + previous IT/HelpDesk at what should be a relatively technical company led me to my original estimate. Even non-technical entry jobs can make 38K (presuming college degree). Anything less than 50K for a technical job, especially one requesting a degree, is a low ball offer.
@_date: 2013-11-10 03:48:10
I would use a combination of localbitcoins and coinbase (presumably US, due to you mentioning an accredited investor) to complete the transactions over the course of a week. That being said, make sure you back up your coins off coinbase as you buy them
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:31:23
This. Theoretically racing your own transaction will always work because most pools select by fee amount

Are yall doing anything to ensure that payment is received, I made a similar bet lower in the comments and wanted to see if you were doing escrow or something similar.

You just did, we only needed someone to say that they saw the agreement on the comments in case one person tries to delete them after the bet.

It's not that. Coinbase acts as a brokerage (primarily to Bitstamp if I understand correctly). It pulls the prices on the charts from a certain market depth volume in both directions. Occasionally bitstamp's order book has an un-executable order. If such an order were large enough it is possible for the bid-asks to cross temporarily, which coinbase then reflects.
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:11:12
Any bears out there want to take me on for the same bet? I will be holding for the 500 rise.
@_date: 2013-11-09 08:00:47
If you're having trouble making much sense of the sidebar as a place to start (just trying to help the less technically inclined out) I would head over to coinbase. They serve as a broker to the major exchanges and have the easiest system to start in. That being said, doing due diligence in anything you decide to put your money in is always a good idea.
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:43:42
transfers over 10K are flagged for AML and tax purposes. If you have never made a transfer of this size and do not have a business or investment account with them, your bank likely informed coinbase as much, which in turn causes coinbase to kick it back. 
Every time I buy more than 10K a day I split my order to avoid the 10K transfer reporting. I advise you to do the same. Blaming coinbase for discretionary business to manage their risk is by no means justifiable.

I'm not sure if you are still reading these, but a lot of the posts so far have talked about new systems being built. I see some of the most potential in bitcoin in the banking system itself.
If a bank such as WellsFargo or Chase (who have WF Sure Pay and Chase Quick Pay respectively) were to use bitcoin to move money between their customers accounts and accounts in other banks it would allow a peer-to-peer banking system facilitating instant wire transfers between partner banks. Admittedly consumers can do this themselves; however, they may not want to due to bitcoin's volatility. If Banks were to hold a semi-large reserve to transfer wealth to each other when consumers do, a consumer never needs to hold bitcoin to perform these transfers. 
Large banks could easily initiate these pilot programs and could stand to cut into the revenue generated by other banks wire programs.  
Just my .02BTC on the most logical next step in large bitcoin adoption.

In a sense, this is a very real possibility, especially since transaction volume is increasing at an extremely fast (my opinion) rate. However, as we progress towards more cloud computing infrastructure it may be very likely that most wallet copies reside on those types of networks instead of fully distributed. This would not be a horrible future, since the current level of distribution is many times the amount necessary to actually ensure security.
That being said, it is very possible that advances in fiber (or even wide area wifi, think google balloons) may make it possible to handle a faster download of the ledger. I don't mention disk space since I think that internet download speed is the main hindrance and will continue to be for a full sync
