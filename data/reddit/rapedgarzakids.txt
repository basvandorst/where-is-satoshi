If moe gets to choose what venue he uses, then he gets to chose how much the prepaid expenses are.  If the prepaid expenses are exorbitant, then choose a different venue.  
You ALWAYS make moe out to be an absolute victim.  Hes human and makes mistakes like the rest of us.  Now if only he would try and wright his wrongs rather than protect his pocketbook....

Coming from someone who is defending a money grubbing promoter with a premium sponsor running a scam, that means alot.  We can be classy together!
You really did just promote vandalism, and then you try and follow that up with a moral critique of me, lol
homophobia?  If garza or moe was a chick i still would have made sexual allusions.

Josh can make choies to protect his kids, but he would rather scam. Actions have concequences. Im on that Christopher Dorner shit, hit em where it hurts most.

When the best possible outcome is vandalism, you have to question if moe could have made better decisions leading up to this point.
Of course you wont admit that moe made mistakes and is making an even bigger one by letting josh speak.

1. I dont buy it for a second that anyone runs a conference at a loss. I doubt moe lost a ton of money at the last TNABC and then decided that it was so great to lose a bunch of money that he wants to do it all over again and lose even more cash with more conferences.  
2. if premium sponsors are 30k, like you said before, than he made 100k off the premium sponsors alone.  Then you add in all the ticket sales and the smaller sponsors.  We can do math, everyone knows that moe is making lots of cash here.
3. More speculation and generous estimates.  The conference makes a profit, i guarantee it.  I was banned because i say exactly whats on my mind.  I never broke any of reddits rules, but the mods dont like my sharp tongue.  Good thing its easy to make a new account!  They really dont like when i talk about acts of violence.  Even without directly threatening violence, talking about violence seems to be enough to get a ban.
4.  Paycoin is an scam, and it shouldn't be promoted next to or associated with bitcoin.  Even if it was just an altcoin, why promote it at a bitcoin conference in the first place?  I care deeply about bitcoin and i hate people who are here just for self promotion and to milk a few bucks out of it (moe garza).  Ill do what i can do interrupt their shenanigans.

why do you care so much about the rules?  Bad rules are made to be broken
