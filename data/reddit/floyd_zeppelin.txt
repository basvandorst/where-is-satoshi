Delighted to see this progress. Scalability and resilience to market conditions is essential to the success of btc. I am hopeful that rifts in the community can heal as the btc protocol improves and scales. 
@_date: 2016-04-26 15:10:41
agree, and while they are at it, change Mycileum to Mycelium. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 07:24:09
Maybe they should be using bits for the denomination, but a neat game
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:31:16
So can we give this BIP a number that we can better refer to?
@_date: 2015-12-24 05:24:34
Interesting take,  is it possible to have both approaches you describe possible in the protocol?  Maybe for some markets,  lightning network is better while others can use wallets with the features you describe and both can coexist.

Maybe I should clarify. I am trying to convert/exchange my asset into  btc using an intermediary like shapeshift. I don't know how to do this through counter wallet where my funds are. When shapeshift asks to deposit the altcoin, I have no idea how to do that, and I keep losing small amounts trying to send it. 
@_date: 2016-03-15 00:53:05
Thank you so much for this detailed explanation, this is exactly what  I need!!!
I follow all you mention, there is only one part that I get stuck on. When you mention that you should send sjcx to a btc address that I control ---- I have that part down using bitaddress.org from an offline PC. 
The part where I keep losing funds is when shapeshift gives me the address to deposit sjcx - they provide me an address within a time frame that upon a timeout, the order never goes through. That address they supply - I have no private key and the exchange never happens, which means I never get a deposit into the btc address I provide. This is the link that always gets me.

Thx so much for willing to help. It's Storjcoin SJCX. I have a bunch that I am trying to shift/convert/exchange into Bitcoin, and I have no idea how to do this in the counterwallet. I tried twice via shapeshift, send small amounts, and I got a message that it timed out ---- although it was sent from my counterwallet, it went to an account I cannot access anymore because I don't have the private key to the receiving address that shapeshift provided. 
I tried IndieSquare, no matter how many times I enter the passphrase (word by word, or copy/paste) it will not recover the account --- I can only access counterwallet on the website using the passphrase. so that rendered it useless, but even if I did get it to work, is there a way to convert/\exchange into btc? I just could not get it to recover my account at all. I tried to create a new account in IndieSquare, but didn't see an option to import my other online counterwallet either, so dead end there. 
By the way, I tried using counterwallet (which is not intuitive) to send my storjcoins to a btc address from my mycelium account. It sent all my sjcx coins there, but they never showed up. I had to sweep the btc private key, and mycelium cannot export an individual private key address. Since its BIP44, I used Wallet32 which thankfully was able to export the account using the same passphrase for mycelium. that's how i was able to sweeep sjcx coins back into counterwallet. However, after multiple trials and errors, and sending amounts to addresses I can never recover, I am frankly tired of this, and starting to wonder if I can ever get assets out of counterwallet into btc!!
I am not exactly new to bitcoin, but if it takes me this much time to figure it out, then that should say something about counterwallet usability. 
Any advice is appreciated!

sounds like a rehash of points Andreas makes all the time, but yeah, worth reading. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 11:15:37
Simple...but nice!

sounds a bit more technical than i have skills for. was hoping for an android app. but i will research your suggestion further, many thx 
@_date: 2016-11-17 04:34:36
@_date: 2016-11-29 03:09:38
yup....i agree
@_date: 2016-12-23 16:14:34
interesting link, appreciate the share
@_date: 2016-11-08 01:31:38
ok, let's see what happens:
@_date: 2016-12-23 16:13:33
I see, thanks, good to know. 
@_date: 2016-11-11 14:32:51
I would like to think that I could tell my loved ones to go to r/bitcoin and ask for some assistance if needed -- and that folks will be helpful in terms of technical advise, who to go to, resources to learn, etc.....
@_date: 2016-12-10 17:31:24
can it be modified so that not identifying anything by default assumes segwit support? might encourage miners to be explicit
@_date: 2015-08-08 18:02:30
I like to print on 100 percent cotton paper for durability and a decent laser printer
@_date: 2015-07-28 05:18:41
do tutanota and protonmail work together nicely if people from one email a user from another?
@_date: 2015-07-24 21:58:51
Nice coverage, although we see this type if visibility more frequently. It surprises me that Bitcoin hasn't exploded yet as an investment vehicle.  Nonetheless, Bitcoin works just as well at high and low prices :-) 
I am not sure about replacing the dollar that soon, but definitely think btc will disrupt many industries and spawn a host of exciting applications, companies and we will see interesting convergence of technologies, finance, investments and social movements around the world 
@_date: 2015-07-21 02:38:31
Just curious if installing both Linux (ubunto or mint) and windows on the same PC, but only using Bitcoin related applications when starting up in Linux, is a risky proposition. I would use a separate SSD drive for Linux and another for Windows to physically separate the operating systems. Suggestions?
@_date: 2015-07-13 18:22:23
I think I agree with this . strange that price will fall due to perceived resolution of the Greek crisis. Why would anyone risk their savings with a bank subject to confiscation, closures and arbitrary taxation? 
These risks present themselves even if Greece gets another bandaid to kick the can down the road. 
I think the Chinese see these realities and are warming up to btc as a solution to be in control of their wealth - free from capital controls or diluted effects of continuous money printing. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:05:48
I am disappointed that we still don't have a proper roadmap for improving and scaling the protocol. I hope we can resolve this important issue soon. Agree the bip100 proposal is nicely balanced.
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:04:53
yes,  big time...wondering if their server has a problem
@_date: 2015-04-07 07:10:20
i think it's possible they are wary about using bitcoin in their narrative, so they use 'blockchain' but what they really mean is bitcoin, the protocol and hte technology
@_date: 2015-04-02 17:31:26
I didn't know this is possible, is it safe to use as a desktop application? thx for sharing..
@_date: 2015-04-01 19:01:17
@_date: 2016-10-29 11:49:11
I hope you're right
@_date: 2016-10-17 21:04:46
How about using an old android phone and an app like mycelium only on wifi but hardly ever staying connected? Is that safe for a stash of btc?
@_date: 2015-03-31 03:07:58
This is strange but the mycelium version on google play says 2.2 released march 30. Has google approved the latest version or do I need to manually upgrade through a direct link?
@_date: 2015-03-27 15:05:15
Thx yes, I searched for blockchain bloat and realized quite a few posts discussing and acknowledging the issue. Solutions seem to be floating around. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 14:11:21
Interesting, I suppose this is a more complex issue than I imagined. I hope solutions are being explored. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 04:29:31
I like this part of the story:
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party, meanwhile, has decided that the government won’t regulate bitcoin and won’t assign any regulatory bodies to oversee the virtual currency ecosystem. While venture companies welcomed the news, executives at larger companies said the move made it difficult for them to start accepting bitcoin because they want a government agency as a watchdog. Otherwise they would face trouble should unfavorable incidents occur.
Also, I don't understand why 'larger companies' want to see regulation, it sounds like they are simply nervous about disruptive technology since venture capitalists and forward looking companies seem to embrace technology better. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:00:47
@_date: 2015-03-27 15:13:05
Thanks for one of the clearest explanations yet on what's going on here..
@_date: 2015-03-16 15:34:20
Keep up the good work
@_date: 2015-03-16 16:07:19
I agree, an encouraging trend
@_date: 2015-03-15 13:25:12
Just to be clear, did Apple announce plans to integrate bitcoin or are you just speculating? I don't think its out of the question, but that would be big news, and I would expect Google to jump onboard first. 
Please realize that my advice is relative to my own preferences and outlook, and I have certainly been wrong before, and have no crystal ball.........etc........
And with that disclaimer, I personally like some stocks, but have looked into commodities and companies that invest in farmland. Gold ETFs are favorable as well. I just think when markets come crashing down, there will be a flight towards assets with limited quantities (gold, productive farmland, other commodities like oil which has been beaten recently, etc..) There is no question in my mind that bitcoin will be a great investment, just don't put in more than you can afford to LOSE....as a reasonable precaution. And when the COIN ETF is launched, I hope to be one of its first investors. I suggest also buying the GBTC fund when it finally starts trading. 
@_date: 2015-10-30 04:48:17
Can you move coins to your own wallet like mycelium and use local trader option? 
@_date: 2016-05-30 02:11:06
Can we increase the fee after broadcasting it, if it's just too slow to confirm? I thought mycelium had a good way to estimate congestion when suggesting fees.
@_date: 2015-03-12 16:02:21
I wouldn't use a third party printer you don't know. Maybe a family member that has a printer you can turn off and dump memory if that works. Have you considered an entropy USB device from mycelium? That seems to be a safe way to print paper wallets. So you can use bip38 as an effective form of secondary authentication. I hope you find a good solution.
@_date: 2015-03-12 17:31:59
Cheaper? Yes. But also more secure, frictionless, trustless, permissionless, etc...
@_date: 2015-03-27 18:37:59
damn...that sucks. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 19:01:45
And I would suggest 100% cotton paper for extra durability. I agree paper wallets are the best option for your requirement
@_date: 2015-03-12 18:04:39
Pretty cool drawings. I am personally happy to see some price stability and an ever so gradual increase over time at this stage. 
I get more excited about the ecosystem being built and the upswell in overall interest particularly among developers, programmers, venture capitalists and banking professionals that see the light. 
Of course I am happy to see a decent spike in the btc exchange but only if its sustained over time. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 13:00:22
I am not so sure about getting rewarded bitcoin just for playing. However, I do think that game-specific sidechains would develop and where assets and services can be bought and sold using bitcoin as a currency. These interactive games which can involve thousands of participants around the world could be very interesting. Who knows... but the potential is very interesting. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 17:42:04
thx man!
@_date: 2016-05-04 00:11:08
Kinda wished  was mentioned..not everyone sees the connection to

gets funnier with every new viewing too
@_date: 2015-03-19 19:17:13
This is a good question. I hope folks that understand this well enough can chime in..
@_date: 2015-03-12 16:37:32
Correct, sorry if I was unclear. Mycelium entropy is one option, and separately the ability to bip38 encrypt your paper wallets is another safety layer if you don't 100 percent trust the printer.
@_date: 2016-07-14 00:17:17
True, ur right i remember that. I am disappointed that the nomenclature didnt catch on as i hoped. Seems there were early disagreement about the naming convention.  
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:04:36
i woukd make sure breadwallet has a solution to exporting the private key in the event of a hard fork, that be messy.. 
@_date: 2016-07-15 12:41:52
yeah right... and how many penny stocks have multibillion dollar valuations with interest from around the world, and thousands of activists, technologists, entrepreneurs and advocates working to expand and improve the ecosystem? 
Bitcoin has the potential to change societies, politics, global finance and the way we understand economics. 
Framing it as a penny stock or ponzi scheme is intellectually dishonest at best. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:56:29
is the mining fee really around $13 right now??? YIKES!! This is not good!! 
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:16:35
you really don't think high fees cripple use cases for bitcoin?
