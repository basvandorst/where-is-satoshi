That offsite storage isn't just used in case of ransoms. Its used in case of any disaster and is well worth the money when one comes along.

A tad simplistic view of competitive markets, true in it's own way but ignores the tendency to monopoly.
This is a great but lengthy article if you fancy an indepth look.

Thank you for the response, despite the character assassination and assumptions on my position I greatly enjoyed reading it. 
We can both agree that our posts were over-simplified and certainly, in some instances,  monopoly is not the worst outcome. However there still occasions where monopoly forms and some intervention is required. Whether that is state or grass roots consumer movements depends on the situation and I understand state can be very heavy handed. 
I would still argue that state intervention is required to protect the consumer, that the bodies that provide this service should be well funded and able to recognise positive monopolies when they occur.

I've done my homework and enjoy your posts on the subject. I'm what you would call a small statist. Still believes that the state is important for some instances but that free markets solve most issues better. 
I can see your point of view, however and will read further into it. As I say appreciate your reply.

Not ban it, tax it. They can then restrict your supply for non payment, probably by choking you.
