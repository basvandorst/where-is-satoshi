Thanks, will do!

DHS and SEC have already come forth and said digital currencies need to be regulated, so they'd have a REAL hard time trying to ban it. Others are saying it was good minus law and academe but I'm not sure exactly who that leaves other than BTC enthusiasts.
Thanks for the response!
@_date: 2014-11-24 11:22:07
For the time being, ease of access and sexiness factor. 
SnapCash is sexy and easy to start. I wish I knew what the other 2 names she rattled off were, but I'm sure the simplicity of "load up your virtual card" was amazingly simple. Bitcoin is just not there, yet.  
When bitcoin has something like this, it will appeal to the "minimal effort, maximum convenience" market: 
@_date: 2014-01-30 20:07:03
Awesome, thanks! Sometime next week, I can't wait!

hmmm...interesting. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 10:32:48
Bitcoin has a good name and it's becoming more recognizable. Silicon Valley will figure out ways to make it easier. Or just have vendors use it in the back end for all transactions because it's cheaper and easier.
@_date: 2014-02-06 09:42:50
OK, I'm sold. Seriously, I'll head there tomorrow, cancel Verizon and dump the iPhone if I know what I'm getting into. I woke up today with my contacts deleted, which is apparently a common problem. The Bitcoin hate just adds to it. Reading the thread, you apparently work for T-Mobile so is there anyway I can shoot you the commission?
Also, which phone should I be looking at getting? 
Basic info: my iPhone 4s is 1 month old. Contract is a year old.
@_date: 2014-02-13 04:20:56
ahh didn't see that, thanks

Great response, thanks!
@_date: 2014-09-09 07:14:57
I get that it's a merchant services provider, but the implications as to why this is more than another merchant accepting, or its link to PayPal and eBay were not as clear.
@_date: 2014-02-07 00:42:10
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
@_date: 2014-04-04 02:50:45
It seems that way. I'm curious if other tech follows a similar pattern of merchant adoption before consumer.

@_date: 2014-11-25 00:55:59
There are some stipulations to that though - you need pictures (sprite is clear...), the cleaning fee must be appropriate to the mess shown in the picture (soda is kind of a silly reason, despite leather seats), and I didn't want to cost some broke college kid a bunch of money because of their drunk friends. 
They all helped with some water and napkins and we called it day. She also gave my the $15 cash for the inconvenience and what not.

Anonymous feed back. We have no idea what riders give us, and they have no idea what we give them. I happen to have a damn near perfect rating, so when I see I got 44/45 5-star rating this past week, I can usually figure out which ride gave me less than a 5-star rating but won't be able to personally identify the person.
@_date: 2014-11-25 01:01:30
We handled it like adults. Some water, lots of napkins, and a bit of making sure nothing was sticky. Spilling sprite sucks, but they were really nice about the situation and gave me $15 after for the inconvenience. After that, I continued driving so no big deal.

If there is something that makes it as easy to load and send money to their friends, then it very well could take off. Seeing this girl offer up the Venmo and SnapCash was definitely a big eye-opener that sending money via phone is a thing with this demographic

This guy is so awesome
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:29:46
There's no need to be rude. It's your type of attitude towards simple questions that is toxic to a growing community.
LBC - Cash.
Coinbase - routed via bank
Neither of which involve credit cards.
Google yields mixed results and various sources of where you can purchase with a CC. With all the potential scams running around, I'd rather go somewhere via reference.
@_date: 2014-11-25 00:51:58
and then associate that with math, which will make most cringe

@_date: 2013-11-16 21:28:47
Well, they recommend creating new wallets for transactions. So I wanted to learn about moving BTC from one wallet to the next and how that all works.
I'd like to have a wallet that is the "holding wallet" and one that is the wallet I give to people to make transactions with.

Would that not deflate the value though?
@_date: 2013-05-04 22:22:33
This is too cool, so much better than writing my model paper right now! So looking at the link, does that mean that the "135bk..." is your wallet address?
Forgive my ignorance, this is very cool to learn!
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:50:51
Interesting...is there anything that stops Bitcoin from doing the same?
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:49:34
That was actually the guy's experience I met up with last night. 10 year banking relationship, and they froze everything and said no more.
Thanks for the input though, it's greatly appreciated!
@_date: 2013-05-04 22:13:07
WHAT?!! Awesome and thank you! You just put the biggest smile on my face! haha  So do I have to do anything with that, or does it just kind of appear in my wallet?
@_date: 2017-06-26 22:49:01
Any hints as to what I'm looking for? 
@_date: 2013-05-02 22:03:45
Forgive my ignorance, so blockchain is for an online wallet and I should have an "offline" wallet, kept on a usb drive(?). How do I ensure encryption and what not?
Edit: I'd like an online store to accept Bitcoin but also to be able to personally accept Bitcoin as well, if there is a difference.
@_date: 2013-05-06 00:27:30
Is it a dumb question to ask how you all got into this? Network security perhaps? I would imagine this isn't exactly a "basic" comp sci seminar...
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:59:50
Generally speaking, it feels much more intimidating. Maybe it's because with traditional investing, I have no idea even where to start while with Bitcoin, it's more focused - Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:29:37
reading that just made me check bitcoinaverage.com, which has suddenly gone from 495 all night to 561!!! What just happened??
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:03:27
I'm not really looking at it as a get rich quick scheme, but more of a learning experience (eg following a market, looking at what others are doing in terms of strategies...that kind of thing).
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:00:18
I think it'll be good to have viewership, can't wait to see what they have to say and watch the price skyrocket or tumble...
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:47:13
Don't all of these apply to Bitcoin? Perhaps moreso?

I'm sure we can, but something is better than nothing. 
Also, keep in mind Subway does online ordering and phone ordering all the time. It wouldn't take much effort to randomly have a sandwich paid for. 
Edit: also, given the nature of our request, offering tips keeps the employees happy to answer a phone call and point to someone.

@_date: 2013-11-20 21:27:10
The swipe device is extraneous and a Bitcoin portal would not force mobile merchants to need additional hardware to process transactions.
@_date: 2013-05-05 03:25:49
Maybe I'm missing something. BTC hits $90, I buy. I watch it constantly for a few days until it hits $120 and sell. Minus transaction fee, I just made $30. I understand it may keep going up but that's fine. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:48:22

@_date: 2013-12-10 07:36:13
iPhone user here and somewhat new to Bitcoin with a few questions.
Isn't Android more prone to virus' given the open marketplace? It seems to me like if this is the case, I'd rather have a secure iPhone than a potential keylogger that discretely tracks my info.
I have the blockchain app and use LocalBitCoins to purchase and sell, what would be the inherent value of switching to an Android? Am I missing something?
I'm certainly open to Android and love Google as a whole but I've always heard that Apple is simply more secure. Any input would be greatly appreciated.
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:01:01
What about creating a new wallet with the same LBC account and sending it there?
Does it auto-transfer when I create a new wallet?
I just don't want to create a new wallet, and suddenly not be able to access my old wallet, with the BTC in it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:03:15
Great explanation, thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:43:20
I've had good experiences with localbitcoins. VERY fast in terms of transfer and ease.
@_date: 2013-12-12 09:29:10
Any of the crypto-currencies available, potentially.
@_date: 2013-11-15 11:23:05
WHY IS THIS GETTING DOWNVOTES???
People come here to LEARN about Bitcoin. We've had numerous "Hey I'm a noob" questions on the front page recently and it blows me away that we as a community aren't welcoming them in with open arms and showing them around (this post has a 1:6 ratio). If SOME people are coming here and asking questions, there are MANY, MANY more who have the same questions, but are simply not going to ask. /end rant.
There are some good explanations below, but maybe this helps:
I went to Localbitcoins.com and made an account. It's free and they only want your email.
There, you can make an e-wallet to hold your bitcoins. Super easy, one is already set up for you.
LocalBitcoins is a place that people can people can buy/sell their bit coins direct. This happens through a bank transfer, a Paypal payment, or a meetup in person. 
I met up with someone in person at a Starbucks, I let them know that it was my first time and I wanted to make 100% certain that confirmations had gone through before we leave so there is no misunderstanding. 
Everything went well. I gave him my receiving address via text and he did right there. Once I saw it on Localbitcoins in my wallet, I was happy. If you want to, you can wait a bit longer and check blockchain.info to make sure the BTC transfer is getting confirmed. ALL transfers go through an open-source network in order to be validated. 
There are other places you can go. Exchanges such as MtGox and BitStamp are places that do the transfers virtually. However, there is a verification process for the account which is usually sending in a copy of a picture ID and a billing statement. Also, you aren't able to actually deposit money into you account until a bank transfer (usually international) gets verified. Once the process is complete, apparently you can deposit more money more quickly but I'm not 100%.
I had a good experience using LocalBitCoins and would rather do things like that in person, rather than go through the longer process generally speaking. I will be setting up the virtual side, but it just hasn't happened yet. 
Also, because there are different exchanges and prices and what not,  is a good site that looks at a number of brokers and exchanges and...well...averages it out. 
Let me know if there is anything else I can help you with in the process. I'm learning by teaching but really learning  along the way. I want to know as much as I can about the system and how it all works. Digital currency makes WAY too much sense. I think Bitcoin has a long and prosperous road ahead of itself and it's exciting to watch and be a part of. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 07:22:11
Excellent answer, thanks! Maybe I'll get a super cheap Android phone and test it with wifi
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:12:07
No you don't, trust me on this
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:45:45
So would this be sufficient reason for them to join in the market and effectively crush competition?
@_date: 2013-05-05 00:59:54
Why do you say day trading is akin to gambling? As a 24 hour trading period, wouldn't it just be a matter of watching the lows and predicting the highs? Does trading happen instantly, or is there a delay, maybe a queue or trade verification process? 
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:57:27
Very nice, thanks for sharing.

Checking this out now, it seems to be MUCH faster and easier, and I already have a wallet to deposit to so it might work out better.

What are some of the flaws of Bitcoin as you see it? It seems like it would be a libertarian's wet dream. I'm new to this concept but definitely warming up the idea as I'm in large favor of using the internet as a platform for just about everything. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:41:24
Why is this a benefit? Doesn't it open up to a lot of potential fraud and monopolizing?

Number 2 would be the biggest concern for me. The NSA could easily mandate something like that with telecom companies. Given the nature, and global reach of the NSA, they could potentially have a large impact from an ISP standpoint.
No, I'm not an NSA conspiracy theorist by any means. I just think politics surrounding Bitcoin fuels the fire, but the NSA could clog up ISPs of bitcoin traffic.

Bitcoin isn't about the currency, it's about the protocol.
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:56:18
Interesting, thanks! 
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:01:29
oops, my bad, I looked for it but didn't see it :/
@_date: 2013-06-22 06:56:20
It's the shirt, I noticed that too. I've put on shirts that did that and went NOPE!
@_date: 2013-11-11 09:24:12
Someone already called my out a reddit-congressional mole. I thought my comment history would cover my tracks, but apparently not. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 07:35:13
THAT is perfect!
I'm so new to Bitcoin, I don't know how to do that but let's make it happen!
@_date: 2013-05-04 22:52:23
So if you use MtGox as little as possible, how do you get your BTC?
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:49:04
Would you mind elaborating on cold storage and/or paper wallets?
@_date: 2013-05-05 18:51:49
This is very true as well. I wonder if there a company with a similar pattern and look at the historical patterns. Right now it's a great thing to watch from the sidelines
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:40:31
I'm trying to, but MtGox is saying I need to do a bank transfer and that it will take 10 days. 
Is there a faster method of purchasing BTC?
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:35:44
Thanks, looking forward to adding to the viewership.
@_date: 2013-11-18 11:34:11
It will shared and passed around I'm sure. So much sweet sweet karma.
@_date: 2013-06-24 23:17:12
Have I? My apologies.
Edit, oh, I see what you mean.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:11:30
Ahh, I was thinking Google check-out
@_date: 2013-05-04 22:10:47
Thanks, are there any other non-default security settings you would recommend?
@_date: 2013-04-30 23:05:48
Alright, good know about the Amazon payment system. I wasn't even looking to help them out with the Bitcoins being PART of the kickstarter, but maybe just to set up a general donation page. Thank you for your input, quite helpful!
@_date: 2013-11-11 23:02:51
Oldie but goodie.
Especially with the amount of new people coming just to "check it out".
@_date: 2013-05-05 02:48:57
haha, I should have been specific. HOW is this crypotgraphy game played? Do you all have algorithm runs or something?
@_date: 2013-12-01 10:17:35
Google wallet is no more
@_date: 2013-05-05 00:56:09
Oh, well good thing I dust return the gesture quite yet, haha
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:19:28
Is it usually higher in person? I paid going rate yesterday and even after it was taking a while to confirm before he could meet me while the price was rising, we agreed upon a set price.
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:34:31
I thought the dollar hasn't been backed by gold since the 70s(?) 
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:46:59
Excellent, I'll check out Coinbase. Thanks for the advice.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:32:53
Awesome, thanks! Is there an app that allows me to track them as well? Still learning, your help is help is greatly appreciated!
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:49:40
I get that, but why wouldn't larger financial institutions get in to crush any potential competition and effectively own the vcurr?
@_date: 2013-11-11 23:57:23
It'd be like randomly buying the next car in line at a drive-thru, or the person behind you a cup of coffee.
@_date: 2013-11-11 09:17:12
dammit...they're more clever than we thought.
@_date: 2013-11-13 05:04:29
I would hope that bitcoin get mentioned as part of it. Now I just gotta find the phone number and talk with the owner at some point this week.
