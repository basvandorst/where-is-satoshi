Get a Nano Ledger, you'll be fine.

The supply is irrelevant if people decide there is no value in adopting it.

You're reaching pretty hard there and there's nothing to back up your claims.

How do you know Bitcoin is a bubble?
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:47:51
Right - The lower it goes the more attractive it becomes as an investment so that explains why people started to buy based on FOMO when the price was rising so much and so fast. Wait a second...

Do people actually believe this would have some sort of impact on the market...

It's pretty easy to use your own logic against you. There's nothing to substantiate that the price will continue to decline from here. How do you know recovering from this correction won't just instill confidence in investors and another bull run comes about?

It's just one exchange that was suspended, don't see this making a big impact especially when SK made it clear there would be no ban.

I just want to say that at 6k when everyone was saying btc was done for and going to crash further down (Peter Schiff and a bunch of T.A.'s) I decided to load up on the buys.

Not sure what you're talking about. The market cap was cut by so much in this recent crash so this rise makes sense if investors are reentering due to decreased risk. And there is still a ways to go to reach previous price levels.

It's impossible to tell. If you have good reason for believing that in a quite a few years Bitcoin will be a widely used currency, you should just settle and purchase an amount that is safe to you. It's insane that people have so much "invested" in BTC that the swings are effecting their emotions. It makes no sense to own Bitcoin and as soon as a panic arises, it's suddenly worth nothing to you?
The only way people can time swings is through pure luck. If the technology is interesting to you, just buckle down and purchase now. If it drops more you can increase your stake if you desire. The price is going to be volatile for a long time so never mind the random walks and think about the future. I think it will be a long time before the average person adopts this technology, but it does say something that retailers are using it. 
I try to think about the emerging markets that could possibly adopt -- and benefit from -- this technology. Then of course all of the interesting developed markets that can deviate from the norm. It's really interesting.

You can believe what you want, but it's widely agreed upon that no one can predict these types of movements in the short run.
