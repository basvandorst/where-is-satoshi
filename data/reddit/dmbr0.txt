Build a new internet

I agree except that it won't take generations because of the rate at which we are transferring information now. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 23:02:21
Oh look they just stopped.

What about all the energy used to make the cars and expended daily in gas to get employees back and forth to their work buildings? The idling alone.... 
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:26:24
I think all of these comments about confirmation times and double spending problems are hilarious. Ya'll just need to put $25 in a wallet and go try it.
I've mapped my mobile wallet to my Bixby button and just have it ready before I get to the counter. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 15:04:54
I used 2 different mastercards and a Visa. Nothing. 
All more reasons to stop using banks and cards and just move to a global currency and payment network.
If the banks were going to solve these problems, bitcoin wouldn't be a thing. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:57:53
Bitcoin doesn't need institutional acceptance and you can already buy items off amazon in BTC at a discount.
Bitcoin only needs peoples acceptance and that definitely starts at busy convenience stores next high traffic tourist spots. I made sure everyone in that place knew I was paying in BTC and 7 to 10 people watched how it worked.
Buy a gift card on Gyft. 
You sound like a lazy person.

Clearly haven't tried it. 
Considering debit card fraud, sitting ATMs, cvc, address, expiration date, sales pitches, inflation, and all the other BS at banks, I'll take having to pull my phone out a little early any day.
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:44:11
Yeah I believe thats why it is the way it is.  how often are going to come across a customer with the mining resources to double spend and that miner is willing to try a double spend for $10? Even transactions worth millions don't make sense to try to double spend. That is the whole concept behind mining. Its more economical to participate honestly than try to double spend your coins. As the network grows and more people mine and participate, these risks become smaller and smaller. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 19:08:31
No...thats not really whats happening. The broadcast goes to the nodes and shows up instantly as it propagates. The third parties and pool info are to mitigate double spends between the time the transaction is broadcast and the mining confirmations start. One does not replace the other. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 17:17:10
I would have...?
@_date: 2018-11-12 14:39:14
No that's just how it works. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 09:26:39
 keep a copy of the blockchain onboard that's up to date at time of disconnect from internet to check against and write transactions to, land, broadcast, confirm. There are ways to start approaching it.

You can't afford $20 of bitcoin?

It is a restaurant. Trying to find the name. Forgot to take picture outside. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 14:06:08
Call the airline. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 14:58:33
No I did not. I had to try 3 different cards before we got to the cash option. 
The attendant said that they always have trouble processing American cards on flights. 
Even more reason we need bitcoin. My American cards don't always work in Europe...
I would have much rather scanned a QR and been done with it.
@_date: 2018-11-13 07:59:13
Nice! Have fun! 
@_date: 2018-11-11 23:35:23
lol what? 
@_date: 2018-11-12 14:05:09
I don't understand the question. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 19:01:45
We'll see once they figure out they can.
@_date: 2018-11-13 08:01:06
Yes! I reccomend samourai wallet! Put some BTC in before you go. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 18:01:48
You don't even know what money is or where or comes from. All government money is just as imaginary. Notches on sticks were longest used form of money. Sea shells have been used as money. Gold has been used as money.  
You must still pay for a newspaper, still go retail stores, and write letters. 
Bitcoin is coming and it doesn't care about your opinion. Don't come crying when the bond, stock, and real estate markets collapse and your imaginary dollars become worthless through hyperinflation. 
Lol another exit scam? The fuck are you talking about? When was there ever an exit scam in the first place? Last I checked there have been over 17 70% drops in 9 years. Again you don't understand markets and price cycles as markets grow. You've just never seen an actual market on a chart because you believe your precious authorities bullshit numbers. 
What ponzi scheme? Old investors arent being paid from new ones. I've already made money. Keep your head in the sand.
You clearly don't know how markets or pricing work. I'm up 5000% dumbass. You are such a stereotypical brainwashed consuming moron its not even funny. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 14:46:23
If they accept bitcoin I don't need change? 
@_date: 2018-11-13 07:58:05
Oh no? You can't create and sign transactions offline?
@_date: 2018-11-13 15:10:26
Then explain. Please educate me. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 09:19:38
Yes! It was! Italy to Paris. 
You could broadcast and sign the transaction in flight and upload to blockchain on ground for processing. There are several implementations in the works. Bitcoin might not yet be 100% ready for it but the real world is ready for something like it to come in. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:18:42
The transaction is immediately broadcasted and shows up instantly. 
 I don't have the time or resources to attack the network to maintain a double spend. 
We both know double spending on $10 is not worth the resources to maintain an attack to double spend so they accept at 0 confirmations and thats it!
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:46:53
They also accept Litecoin and Ethereum
@_date: 2018-11-12 16:58:40
Let me know if you need other help
@_date: 2018-11-12 19:03:15
Hahahahaha that's completely irrational. Poor guy.
@_date: 2018-11-11 19:13:53
@_date: 2018-11-16 08:56:43
Fun fact, I  Never said they didn't accept cards....my cards issued by American banks did not work in the reader's. This is becoming more and more of a problem. 
 Sounds like you're the one who hasn't actually been on a Ryanair flight. And if you have, it certainly hasn't been recently. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 14:49:04
@_date: 2018-11-11 21:03:58
Uh what? Makes no sense.
@_date: 2018-11-13 15:27:36
Because American cards don't work in flight and having to go around the plane asking for change seems silly. 
The amount of extra work created in making these transactions happen would be gone.
@_date: 2018-11-11 22:11:10
Bet they would for 20% off their bill. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 21:51:15
Where you at?
@_date: 2018-11-16 13:57:28
No its not a glitch. Its the way offline wireless terminals work over here. Ive run into it 3 other places on the ground. American banks have blocked cards on these terminals. It's an inconvenience multiple places. 
Stop pretending to know what you're talking about. 
What slow transactions? Transactions broadcast and show up instantly and then confirm. Again showing your ignorance of a system you've never actually used. 
Yeah who would use a currency that appreciates hundreds and thousands of percent with less than 1% known steady inflation?
I'm not salty about anything considering I started CPU mining in 2010. I'm perfectly content with a $5000 price when I entered the market when the price was less than $100. Once you live through one major price cycle you're set. I love the volatility. Every dip is an opportunity to increase my wealth. I can live off the volatile upward price appreciation with no extra effort. Why would I keep my savings in a fake currency I have to make more of every year? 
Sounds like you're salty your precious government money has real competition. 
Only idiots and noobs who don't understand money and markets care about the upward volatility.
Keep using your fake dollars printed by politicians backed by your labor that lose 10% purchasing power per year and maintain fake stability through manipulation. 
Where do you think people will go when the stock market, bond market, and housing markets collapse simultaneously in the next crash? 
With bitcoin I would have just scanned a QR and been done. 
One global currency everywhere we don't have to pay banks to exchange? That's censorship resistant and private? 
Why don't you go try it instead of thinking you know everything about something you've never experienced? 
Or keep making yourself look like an ignorant fool I don't care. 
Get out of your basement and actually get on a plane.
@_date: 2018-11-12 15:03:16
I used 2 different mastercards and a Visa. My girlfriend tried Amex. Nothing. 
Yup all more reasons to stop using banks and cards and just move to a global currency and payment network.
@_date: 2018-11-13 08:00:00
wtf are you rambling about? Nothing you're saying makes any sense. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 09:00:23
No.....its not an Amex. I don't use Amex because it sucks and no one accepts it in europe. My two mastercards and a visa issued by AMERICAN BANKS period are what had problems. 
I never said Amex, yet you form a whole argument around your assumption and look like a schizophrenic moron and people agree with you without even checking. Unbelievable. 
I was specifically told by the attendant they have problems with cards from American banks. Not American Express Cards. 
I'm travelling with 6 people with visa and Mastercard from 4 different banks.... All the same problem. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 15:01:21
LOL wut?
@_date: 2018-11-11 18:49:22
It doesn't depend on people not being lazy and wasn't commenting on paying at a POS. overall is much easier and cheaper than other forms payment at a POS in my experience. 
I was speaking more to purchasing things off amazon that OP was talking about. Sure its not accepted directly but ill glady take a 20% discount on my order for placing it through another site. 
How much work is it really to click on purse.io link and use it to pay on Amazon?
@_date: 2018-11-16 09:06:30
2) because there aren't huge fees on the bitcoin network. That's not how pricing in bitcoin works. How is scanning a qr code complicated?
Might want to actually use bitcoin and try traveling before you start calling people stupid and trying to teach them about things you know nothing about because now you just look like an absolute stupid moronic idiot. Apparently you can't even read correctly and what you do read your brain just makes shit up to fill in what isn't there to fit your argument. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 14:08:48
Oh ok excuse me. It's an establishment that you can sit down and order food or take away that also sells snacks next to the leaning tower.
