so what about in a pool.  I was explained to like this is how it works I may or may not be correct.  In a pool of lets say 100 people mining for bitcoin, its compared to 100 people all working independantly towards finding a block and then when one finds one they all split it and theres many different distributions I know that part.  SO im picturing it like this.  Theres a block in center and there is 100 people from the pool surrounding it ( Im only using the 100 people from the pool excluding the millions of others just for sake of understanding the pool workings).  Now each person around the pool has a handful of quarters, the amount of quarters depends on the hashrate of each rig.  Now these 100 workers keep throwing up the handfull of quarters as fast as their hashing power allows them to.  Once one of the rigs quarters all land heads up he has solved the hash or the block whatever its called and tells the pool that he found it It could be the smallest guy or the biggest guy depending on the luck factor of course. ; therefore a pool is just a pool of thousands of people thus increasing the chance of finding a block by sheer numbers of people  Is that right or am I seriously misinformed?

or when there is a pool does every member of the pool work on trying to find the block?  It says user JohnSmith found the block.  Its really confusing as to what pooling means and mukltiple workers or multiple users vs one worker/user.
