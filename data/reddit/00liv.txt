Well I’m just feeling sick to my stomach at the moment. I don’t know how to tell my husband. He works so hard for our family and I thought I was going to be able to take some pressure off.

It was 4 digits.

Aw man and here I thought I’d avoided doing that like all my other friends in their twenties

Update 1: response from support
Due to the CIBC situation (CIBC holding a significant portion of our funds hostage), users withdrawing fiat are facing delays.   
As a result, fiat withdrawals are being processed using our other operational funds. At the current rate, we expect all withdrawals that are currently marked as completed to arrive within the next 10 business days, with many arriving much sooner. At this time we are unable to provide specific dates for each user due to the volume of requests.   
We have two options in this case:  
1) You can wait for it to arrive. If it has been marked complete, it should arrive in the next few days.   
2) If the payment has not yet been released by our payment processor, we can return the funds to your account so that you can convert to cryptocurrency and withdraw instantly. If you choose this option, we will re-imburse you for the cost of the trade.  
Please advise if    
We appreciate your understanding as we work to bring payme t processing times back to normal in this unfortunate situation.

Have you made any recently? How delayed are we talking. I can handle delays if they communicate. But to keep getting different dates make me extremely concerned.

That sucks big time. I’m glad you recovered most of it.

Will do. Thanks. I’m trying to keep calm.
