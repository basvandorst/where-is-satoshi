This only applies to residents of Hawaii, and how the state gov chooses to 'protect' them.

The end result is insincere questions and extremist views in the answers.     
   
Which basically describes almost all of reddit now, to a fucking 'T'

This might be a valid argument, but really only in theory.
Yes, the open source nature of bitcoin will mean that interest would switch to other iterations if Bitcoin were to fail.
But... *if Bitcoin were to fail*, it would be a PR disaster that would threaten everyone's confidence *in any cryptocurrency* existing now or in the future... 
There is a massive amount of investment right now in bitcoin, and if the whole infrastructure were to collapse for whatever reason, all the mining equipment of course would be switched to some other compatible cryptocurrency. But the confidence in the value of those coins would be vastly undermined by a hypothetical historical failure of Bitcoin.
OWS was a movement, in a way that is similar to the idealization that many supporters and fanatics have for Bitcoin. Bitcoin truly is, in a way, a movement. It calls into question the very basis of money as we know it in the modern world. It offers an alternative to the invasive system of electronic purchases (credit cards mainly) that record and track every single tiny financial transaction we make. It's horrid, the lack of privacy we have now. Fiat currencies that are in the control of central bankers, and in the US, seriously corrupted by a private banking system that has brought us to cataclysmic collapse in the recent past. 
You think those guys in the Fed are simply wringing their hands whimpering into their pillows every night when they think of the threat that Bitcoin could offer them and their stranglehold over our financial system?
They would certainly do everything they did to OWS, to Bitcoin. AND MORE.
**MUCH MORE.**
