I just mean that if you own a US dollar you can know it's backed by the government of a country that's worth tens of trillions of dollars in real material wealth, such as the things I listed. A dollar is a unit of debt that the US government (the most powerful unified entity in the world) owes to the holder of said dollar. A bitcoin is...what?

Something about bubbles seems to do that

Novice question - why is the fact that bitcoin has no backing not a problem?
Say what you will about fiat currency, but if you own a US dollar at least there's a material reality behind the dollar (food, oil, weapons, etc produced by the US); you own a piece of the US. If you own a bitcoin you own a few bits chisled into silicon backed by...shady private citizens? As far as I'm aware there's no material reality to a bitcoin. It seems like the definition of a speculative bubble, and it feels like it's based on incorrect assessments of existing currencies. Scarcity is only one necessary aspect of a currency.

There is no alternative to fiat currency. All these arguments are based on the impossible fantasy that fiat currency works in the first place. The entire world economy is balanced on a debt bomb, that's not functional. Fiat currency isn't functional, and neither is bitcoin. They're both bald faced ponzi schemes.

Bitcoin was and will always be a ponzi scheme but no one ever said you couldn't make money ripping off idiots

This feels really disingenuous as someone who doesn't know anything about the issue.
