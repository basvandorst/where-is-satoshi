I think he meant to say Monero ;)

This is an immature investment strategy and I wish you the best of luck!

May be true for Bitcoin. Is not true for Monero.

“Looking at ways to add more anonymity to Bitcoin.” .... Is he Nicholas van Saberhagen!? /s .... sort of...

I think you might be confusing different principles. We were talking about fungibility. Sharing an XMR view key is up to the user to choose, just as opening the door to cash accounts would be something an individual or business chooses to do for an audit. The fact that sharing XMR view keys is not mandatory is one of the reasons it is the closest to achieving fungibility. What is mandatory with XMR is default privacy - concealing the sender, receiver, and amount - always (making it fungible).

None of these are base-layer, default privacy features, which would be the only way to make Bitcoin actually fungible. So long as transactions can be discovered and traced, chain analysis can mark tainted coins and other coins will be sold at a premium - and bitcoin will not be fungible.

Monero is as close as it gets.
@_date: 2019-10-11 14:03:37
Fungibility with Bitcoin is a fantasy.
@_date: 2019-10-12 13:31:32
LN is not mandatory on the base layer, so there will always be some coins that are traced and others that are more difficult to trace (but still traced). This Reddit user gave a pretty sufficient explanation of the traceability concerns for LN:

“Accepting btc with a "dark history" is not illegal in any democratic country, and probably wont ever be.”
P2p crypto threatens the existence of government backed fiat. If you cannot imagine a future with surveillance states and oppressive jurisdictions abusing their powers to cramp down and instill fear by threatening innocent users who happened to inadvertently accept tainted bitcoins - that’s your prerogative. I personally think that is a naive stance.
“This is simply not true, mixing dies help achieve 100% anonymity as long as you don't reuse wallet addresses”
Wasabi wallet dev has stated it is not 100% anonymous and still susceptible to analysis and attacks. There have also been stories like this one: 
“You wish. LN apps are free on app store, quite inutitive to use and tx costs are less than a cent. How is that too expensive?”
I was referring to the operator/node level. If it cannot be accessible for anyone then you run the risk of a less decentralized system where only the highly technical or wealthy are securing the network.
“You probably should read a little bit about schnorr signatures  ”
I am familiar with Schnorr signatures and their weaknesses as described by Andrew Poelstra of Blockstream. 
“The solution for what? If youre talking about instant, borderless, cheap and pseudonimous transactions (soon to be anonymous) then yes, BTC is in fact the answer”
I’m talking about the answer for a truly fungible digital cash. Bitcoin certainly is not that.

What does 20 transactions per day have to do with the lack of privacy at the base layer?
@_date: 2019-12-11 22:22:38
With dollars and gold any average person has no way of knowing where that piece of money has been before, so they pay the going rate to exchange for said item. With the traceability of Bitcoin and the ability for any regulatory body to label you a criminal or terrorist for accepting or buying any BTC with a dark history, it is irresponsible not to care where your Bitcoin came from. Mixing has been shown to do very little for defeating chain analysis and the entry to LN is too expensive and technical for an average user. Neither of these seem like viable, safe options for anyone who wants to keep their wealth private or share money with friends and family in surveillance friendly or oppressive jurisdictions (which is increasingly becoming most of the planet). Bitcoin is not the solution.

What makes Bitcoin fungible? Would you buy a newly minted Bitcoin at the same price as one that was traced to have come from darknet markets?
@_date: 2019-12-12 16:38:54
This clearly isn’t going anywhere.
@_date: 2019-12-11 17:04:05
I think you are confusing equality at the technical level with fungibility at the economic level. Just because the protocol says 1btc=1btc doesn’t mean someone will buy a newly minted Satoshi for the same price point as one that’s been traced through darknet markets. The traceability of Bitcoin makes it non-fungible in the economic sense.
@_date: 2019-12-11 16:58:52
By definition a “future” improvement does not currently exist in real life. As long as base layer is traceable the coin cannot achieve true fungibility.
@_date: 2019-12-11 22:14:40
I hate to break it to you, but it kind of seems too late already. Bitcoin is too big for a fundamental change like that. Look what happened with the blocksize shenanigans....
@_date: 2019-12-11 14:45:43
So Bitcoin is currently not fungible.
@_date: 2019-12-11 13:16:52
Do you believe fungibility currently exists in BTC?
@_date: 2019-09-03 19:13:43
Glad to see this is the top comment. I think this indicates more people are beginning to realize the inherent weaknesses of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:49:34
How long are your willing to wait for that hypothetical minute?
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:00:44
You mean the bug that wasn’t exploited and was ethically disclosed?  
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:27:50
Yeah, just use Monero
