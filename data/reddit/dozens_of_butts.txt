It might seem that way, but after all, you don't call a plumber to tell him your pipes are working just fine and nothing needs to be addressed.

While that is true and all, *not* retaliating against Bitstamp and *not* getting mad about it won't get people their money back, it won't spread the word that they have these ridiculous KYC requirements in place, and it won't recoup people for their losses.

Bitcoin and PayPal may not be flat out against one another, but they do have an adversarial relationship. If bitcoin starts to catch on in a truly big way, PayPal will lose money because less people will be willing to pay transaction fees to them.

Its all brute force, yeah. An onion url is a hash of an RSA public key, and only the person with the private key can control the onion.

Don't feel bad man, 2C-I seems to be really unstable. I know a guy who would take a 2-3 tabs every once in a while, then one day he took 1 tab and ended up in the hospital with blood in his lungs. All the horror stories I read about 2C-I seem really random, like there's no rhyme or reason to them.

Question for people more educated in the inner workings of bitcoin than me: how are transaction fees distributed? Did one miner get $13k, or was it split up between multiple people? What do you think the average payout for people who helped confirm this transaction was?

Erowid fucking rules. They've definitely saved me and several of my friends from making mistakes that almost definitely would've landed us in the hospital. &lt;3

You can trade bitcoins for darkcoins on sites like Cryptsy, no need to go all underground for it.

Lucky for you dogecoins are nearly worthless! $30k Dogecoin, that's what, like, a couple dollars?

Oh, weird, I never knew that! Is the same true for other members of the 2c-x and 25x-NBOMe families, or are 25I-NBOMe and 2C-I the exception? I noticed erowid didn't list similar warnings on other 2C-X/25x-NBOMe pages.

Who just has $3.6 million in hardware sitting around uninsured? What a horribly irresponsible thing to do.

I'm pretty sure it is with a regular desktop. However, if you have very powerful hardware and/or very good luck, you can do it.
Fun fact: your odds of generating a "blockchain" onion on the first try is about 0.000000000453%.

That's a bot, ya weenie

What *about* them? Nobody uses the vast, vast majority of them so there's really no need to add them into font sets.

$0.59 would be more than two quarters. $0.059 would be slightly more than a nickel. $0.0059 is less than a penny.

Who's to say it wasn't a red herring from the start though? Satoshi's plan from the start was to create a revolutionary new system of transferring and storing value, and he was smart enough to stay anonymous, so he likely suspected that people involved in global financial institutions would come looking for him for some nefarious reason or another. Throwing out a fake clue like that would be a good first step to throwing off the rich and powerful.

I got 3 BTC at $20/piece in like 2012. I kick myself every day for selling at $1200, even though I still made out like a bandit by any normal investments' standards.
