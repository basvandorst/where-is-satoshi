Neo, when we are ready you won't... be able to move your btc because the on chain tx fee will be $100k.

Wish I could short mcafee himself.

It can be done using a convoluted solution like segwit which takes a long time to get adopted by wallet and exchange operators, and stifles adoption and usability along the way. Or you can just take an easy and obvious solution and do a HF. 
Some here will tell you HFs are horrible things, but that is just not true. E.g. just look at Monero, they do a mandatory HF every 6 months for protocol upgrades without any issues.

Good point, this guy is always trying to portray himself as a good guy, but is in fact sleazy af.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think the fork has happened yet, just the snapshot to see who holds btc.

Hi, just a quick question. I understand every crypto to crypto transaction is taxable, but if I say buy btc now, then after a month buy ethereum, given that I didn't hold btc for a year or more is this still taxable under CGT or falls under Income Tax?

It's a crypto meme, some drunk guy once misspelled hold while bitcoin was crashing and it caught on since.

Thank you very much for explaining. I'm in the UK, and don't really trade regularly, maybe only a few times a month to invest in some new currencies if I spot a new opportunity, so I'm guessing that wouldn't really count as day trading?
Will definitely give your website a check. :)
