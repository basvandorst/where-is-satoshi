What exchange did you buy on?
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:17:37
Scroll to bottom on the app

Read up on  Nano s ledger 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:53:16
You can just enter your bank routing number and account number.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:06:12
In the same boat. Waiting for the card

Ok thanks for the reply.

I think it’s similar. Rather than choosing your bank, click my bank isn’t listed or something like that 
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:46:11
Nic work 
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:27:53
It will eventually come back on its own
@_date: 2018-09-23 22:03:57
Well the fact that these are shipping next week and other competition ASICS are not shipping till November, first batch could make ROI pretty quickly.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:56:08
I hope you didn’t lose too much :-(

In person 
Where are you located?
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:13:23
After buying a SMALL amount to test the waters, when you are ready to purchase a larger amount, log in to gdax using your coinbase credentials. Transfer money from coinbase into your gdax account (no fees and instant) and then buy for much lower fees and you can set limit buys.
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:44:47
Great catchy web address, easy to remember.

Or mined bitcoin in 2011....
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:28:24
I had the same issue.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:32:24
It was about 2 weeks
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:45:30
Depends how long you plan to keep it on an exchange. 
Look up ‘Mt.Gox’
Secondly it depends on how much it is and can you afford to lose it?
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:06:30
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:18:58
You are welcome :-) 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:48:13
Or if you already have money in coinbase, transfer cash to gdax, using your coinbase credentials. Wayyyyy less fees
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:29:17
It is now... I spoke too soon ....
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:52:24
My miners are enjoying the high transaction fees 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:41:34
Zoom out.
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:30:38
Thanks for the heads up 
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:35:42
No worries, I had the same issue for a while. Glad I could help.
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:57:47
Agreed. OP - login to gdax using your coinbase credentials.
Then transfer (for free and instantly) your BTC from coinbase to GDAX.
Then withdraw from gdax to your destination FOR FREE.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:03:20
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:00:28
Yup. Time to buy is NOW
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:19:20
Ok we are on the same page. I was assuming they already had funds in coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:58:16
Look in the menu where it says ‘bitcoin addresses’ . If you have more than one there, there is an option to import all your bitcoin from those addresses to your main address. You will however be charged a fee for doing so. Once done you should now have enough to sell.
@_date: 2018-09-23 23:39:57
That’s definitely a good point. I wish there was a way to repurpose ASICS. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:07:03
Sell the crypto to someone for cash.
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:33:09
Can you find out his wallet id and see how much he has managed to collect so far? It would be interesting to see
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:20:36
Ripple is not tanking.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:09:53
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:01:40
Transfer from gdax to coinbase and vice versa is instant, so not sure what your point is?
@_date: 2018-08-27 02:48:41
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:20:00
It’s 72 cents here.
@_date: 2018-05-19 20:16:30
Great thanks for the info. That’s a good start. I will keep you posted.
Over the winter I was enjoying heating my house with my miners, so this will be my summer setup
@_date: 2018-05-19 17:36:58
Ok so I want to use this design to heat my pool (approx 18000 gallons)
What would I need to power the Bosch pump using 110v ? Or would there be a better alternative? Secondly, how much power will the Bosch pump use?
@_date: 2018-05-15 01:43:52
press the escape key first, before typing ":wq"
@_date: 2018-05-19 19:00:09
Well I am not looking to heat it completely with the miners- just use the water to cool the miners and at the same time maybe adding a degree or two to the pool, rather than completely wasting the heat output.
Currently my pool is at 65c but gets up to low 80s in the summer (I’m in MA, US)
I might just relocate my miners to my pool shed which is next to my pool, so the pump would only have to pull water up by about 1-2 feet max.
Currently I have a 1.5 hp pump for the pool.
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:50:46
You can if you follow the mfgs instructions on verifying if it’s unaltered.
@_date: 2018-10-16 18:14:36
Keys. Sorry 
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:49:18
But you can still hold the KEYS on the nano s even if the app has been removed.
EDIT: Keys not coins
@_date: 2018-10-16 16:10:26
Yeah I have found it’s a bit of a hassle deleting and reinstalling apps.
@_date: 2018-10-16 17:25:21
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:51:41
Yes it’s legit
They are just pumping bch 
@_date: 2019-02-01 01:40:25
Exactly what I was thinking !
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:59:06
You could try changelly or shapeshift. Or you could go to an exchange and buy BCH with BTC
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:10:26
I use HODL. It’s not bad
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:25:32
Who knows. It’s new territory at this point 
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:10:55
No fee, it’s just the spread is a bit more
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:17:26
Takes about an hour
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:47:34
That won’t arrive till end of March early April at the earliest, yet it’s only 16Th vs 13.5 ? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:35:46
Ha ha I love the it crowd
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:39:38
Well you have sold now, so what are you worried about 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:18:48
That has been the case for all Bitmain orders over the last couple of months 
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:33:41
Send it to your coinbase wallet BTC address
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:00:43
This question keeps coming up
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:04:06
That app looks like HODL on the iPhone 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:21:03
Buy the coin instead
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:28:38
Wise words.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:03:21
I’m in the same boat. It’s now been 36 hours.... not really worried
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:26:39
You are welcome
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:14:51
Um glitch. 0.05 BTC is only worth $450

@_date: 2017-11-12 15:33:09
I did the same but it’s been 36 hours. 
The wait has only just begun.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:36:23
Stop reposting this
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:58:02
I would have too but my bitcoin sent to an exchange is still pending after 48 hours
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:25:09
I had 0.9 BTC ....
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:42:03
If they are quickly becoming obsolete, dragonmint is only 2Th more, and not shipping till at least March . 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:43:37
No cut off, it’s number of units sold
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:20:25
It’s not a share. It’s a currency . You don’t buy shares of pounds or dollars.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:58:51
We are not even close to the lows.

@_date: 2018-02-01 13:55:03
I made less than 20 transactions. However, I transferred back and fourth between coinbase and gdax, and my hardware wallet. Each of these transactions apparently adds up, and has therefore triggered my issuance of this 1099k.
I have never held more than 0.4 BTC, and have only cashed in $3,000 USD.  
Yet my 1099k claims $31,000 !!!!
