cheers, my updates have been going for 20 mins or so. there is still 48 mins left on "scanning transaction history" Eletrum you say? is that like a QT wallet? and hour or more to process anything really sucks.

These sort of rivalries happen all the time like ford v chev or xbox v playstation or mav v pc. Probably because people want to feel like they have backed the better product and therefore the competitors product must be worse.
bitcoin v dogecoin is kind of silly though, it's like comparing a ferrari with a daewoo. They are both very different animals.

Well my toddler is calling everyone at home a baby at the moment because kids at his kindy are calling him one and he hasn't got the social tools needed to fight it yet. He takes the soft option to deal with it and make himself feel better. Maybe it's the same with internet bullies, people are mean to them in real life and they don't have the social tools they need to fix it so they lash out at others on the internet.

Probably beacuse it's easier to be nasty to someone when there is no danger of them punching you in the face for it.

not fussed about which currency I use to get it :)
@_date: 2014-08-09 11:46:04
It's also the reason I am buying bitcoins for the first time :) I have 700k dogecoins but it seems like a sinking ship atm. I'll hold on to my doge but I think it's time to buy btc instead.
@_date: 2014-06-06 06:23:25
Fair enough, I bought my first dogecoins last week, before that I haven't even thought about digital currency. So I will concede that I don't know how bad relations are between the two groups. A paste eating retard is far from the worst thing I have been called though.
Either way I have reasons for choosing to use dogecoins.

yep, someone suggested electrum. im downloading now.
@_date: 2014-09-22 12:16:52
im pretty sure I have the full client.. ie it downloaded 20gig or so whien i first used it
@_date: 2014-09-22 12:03:52
I have the address that I sent the coins to. I have the password needed to send coins from that address. I think the question I need to ask Is if I have an address and I have the password, what is the easiest wallet to use to make it an everyday wallet? armoury seems to be very slow.
@_date: 2014-08-08 13:06:32
thanks ill look into it :)
@_date: 2014-09-22 12:23:55
thanks mate downloading now.
@_date: 2014-08-08 13:23:52
thank you.

lets just say my Country is about to implement nsa levels of survelance. 2 years of internet records and phonecalls in the name of "counter terrrorism" which I think is bullshit. I'm just looking for privacy.
@_date: 2014-08-09 02:12:18
So very true :)
@_date: 2014-06-06 04:58:50
Aww I only have dogecoins and I think it's hilarious. This isn't malicious :)
@_date: 2014-09-22 12:15:36
Next question then, what is the best client to use for day to day stuff? armory has been going for 1/2 hr and has still got an hour to go to "scan transaction history" is there something more instant I can use?
@_date: 2014-09-22 11:56:08
no, i sent my coins from an exchange to and armoury wallet. I have the password and the wallet address. but the coins are not showing up on armoury. I have confermation that it went to that address though :(
@_date: 2014-08-09 07:57:24
thanks I am going to go through these guys :)
@_date: 2014-09-22 12:09:37
maybe public address is a more appropriate term? I sent the coins to that address.

Lol the moon belongs to doge.. you can go to mars or something. 
(Edit: I dont have any dogecoin)  
@_date: 2018-07-03 06:54:44
I have 100000 dogecoin in a wallet I forgot the password to, it could happen

Sweet thanks mate, my first reddit bitcoin tip :)
