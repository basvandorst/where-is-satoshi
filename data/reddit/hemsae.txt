Muffin is going to get strung out on dope one way or the other. At least with legalized drugs, we can reduce cartel violence. And when people don't have to worry about the law "catching up" with them, it's easier for them to get help getting off drugs.
Decriminalization is good because the war on drugs is unwinnable, but the war on cartels is far more easily solved. Destroy their corner on the market.

I need to move some to cold storage... I have too little too justify hacking me, but still...

Because they can't contact your bank and seize your funds that way?

This target price is WAY too low, but the idea is actually quite good. Unfortunately, the biggest hurdle would be making that price low enough that the target audience could afford it. Donations are great in theory, but there simply is never enough donations to make a market happen. Better to aim for high-production run and cheap, I'd guess.
By avoiding a full smartphone OS, though, I'm sure a phone that could be used for sending and receiving Bitcoin probably could reach below $50. I would imagine the only way to achieve that target price or less would be to do away with using QR codes as the means of sharing the address. Maybe basic IR communication would work. Hell, even a camera might be possible, but just barely. And I imagine it would increase the processor requirements.

There is no reason to ever have curtains over your windows, unless you are involved in something illegal.

Well, I WOULD buy it if it was 9 cents a gigabyte.

Yeah. Darknet purchases aren't something I'm interested in. What I'm interested in is "limited risk" transactions. I want to KNOW that, if I'm purchasing something online for $30 via Bitcoin, I don't have to trust the company or person selling the product. At worst I'm out $30. There's no way they're going to empty my bank account via a Bitcoin transaction because I am the one who initiates the transaction.
And I think that's where Bitcoin has a large market to grow into. If you're not SURE you trust the seller of the product or service, it's nice to know that AT WORST you're only out the full price of the product or service, not whatever was in your bank account. I've bought software and services from some pretty sketchy sites before via Bitcoin, and I was MUCH more comfortable with it than using PayPal.

Yes, but they also have been a bit too eager to regulate it. Bitcoin is wonderful because it's NOT heavily regulated.
I agree that (b) is pretty unsubstantiated, but I would be cautious about governments being "neutral or warm" to Bitcoin. It's almost certainly because they see opportunities to regulate Bitcoin.

It's sad how obvious that point is, yet how easily it's overlooked. TOR would be the subject of every major crack-down on illicit child pornography... if it weren't for all the people in third-world countries using it to experience the full internet.
We already KNOW encryption would be illegal, if it weren't used to secure traditional online purchases.
Yes, perhaps "buying a latte with your phone" isn't the POINT of Bitcoin, but without the people buying a latte with their phones, the government would just assume all Bitcoin was being used to purchase drugs.
Buying a latte legitimizes the currency, and makes it resistant to legislation. Without the people buying lattes, the people buying weed (or whatever) wouldn't be free to do so.

Man, if Trump wins, I'll be so happy... An extra 0.01 BTC, and we get to Make America Great Again!

I also remember Bruce Schneier writing about digital currencies in Applied Cryptography.
