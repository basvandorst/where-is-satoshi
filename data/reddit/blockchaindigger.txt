I'm not an operator (yet), but i did collect some info regarding:
 (AND  ! )
 and 
And indeed a couple of warnings:
- check the dates on those articles and try 'n' find the latest info regarding the subject of that article
- try and find more social/business networks/venues where ATM operators cluster to exchange info on lawful and un-lawful enforcement, read lots of articles and do not be afraid to contact 'those that have gone before' and paved the way (for better or for worse; remember you're unwillingly a participant in a 'war on (internet-)cash/crypto' and the banksters will have a ball burning your ass in public view at the village square just to deter other financial dissidents if you gain any noticable success)
- try to lease a machine instead of buying it: easier to get out of the business if/when ATM's are made illegal
- try and find a business model where they can not confiscate or freeze your personal assets and/or business assets 'pending an on-going investigation'
 Other than all that I wish you and your business all the best and all luck in the world

I'm pretty noob too and I am also worried 'bout getting hacked. After looking around a bit I settled for a Tails (secure encrypted OS on a stick with persistent /home) USB stick, because it seems as secure as is possible these days and it has Electrum wallet build in. It can be a little difficult if you've never wrestled with a Linux OS before, but you do not need to be a rocket scientist to just use it as a secure wallet and password repository. If you want to play around with Tails make yourself another Tails USB stick you can screw up without losing important stuff. Make a backup image of your Bitcoin-on-Tails stick with CloneZilla (or somesuch) before upgrading the Tails stick. Upgrading a Tails stick can still f\*ck it up sometimes.
If you want more info to read up on stuff it seems that [ is considered a valid source of information by the community. IMHO all the bitcoin info at that site is worth while.
P.S.: an "account" is something you get at a bank. Bitcoin, considered internet cash, is like cash fiat money you put in your own pocket... and that is called a "wallet"... ;-)

I miss one thing that imho needs to be at the top of this list; first take out all your bitcoin, leave just a couple of satoshi and tell them that you will return as an active customer once they comply with customers wish(es). You, being a client parking your money there, are a vote. If not bye-bye 'service'.

ack... this is from a convo in 1993:  ...
“Software,” [Bill Gates] said, “is an IQ business. Microsoft must win the IQ war, or we won’t have a future. I don’t worry about Lotus or IBM, because the smartest guys would rather come to work for Microsoft. Our competitors for IQ are investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.”
I feel bitcoin/crypto is in the same situation regarding competition with the financial sector, the wannabe regulators with deep pockets, in attracting and keeping the smartest programmers. And on top of that there is a bunch of high IQ programmers stuck in countries where they are not allowed to work freely on bitcoin except to further their regime's agendas. This must be tough competition for underpaid/unpaid devs/volunteers... maybe we, as users/profiteers of/from this wonderful tech, should do more to support them

seems you have some work to do: 
by the way... who told you you need to dump all your money in one wallet? If you experience limits, open another wallet somewhere else and exchange the next x amount of money. It has been said that all on-line/web wallets WILL one day skip with the money so it has been advised left and right to spread your money and thus spread the risk.

You people must be very happy in your Thanksgiving, Santa Claus, Tooth Fairy style Disneyland world, ladida-ing about with your pink glasses on. It's probably  time you wake up to the real world where the whores (self-degeneration for career (MeToo/religion/hazing), money (banksters/hookers) or power (government/military/police)) come in any size and gender, from all social environments and financial backgrounds, any planet or organization, any color or religion and all levels of education...  ... it's even an official sport... :( . &lt;/rant&gt;
But I certainly do agree with you it is "not cool" at all. So now let us all get back to healing this crazy world and its deceived 'n' lost peoples, with non-corruptable registration and financial self-determination. To me that sounds like a good start.
It is like Trey Gowdy says here,  , that we, the peoples of this world, will have to get off of our couches, stop paying corrupt souls to do our work (or God's work like they love proclaiming  ), stop pointing fingers at others and get to work ourselves together. So buy as much bitcoin/crypto as you can, only use bitcoin/crypto and hodl hodl hodl...
(P.S.: i am not religious but spiritual, not alone but part of the human race and I love all living beings... even the rich and powerful, incapable of empathy, for they are just mislead by the above weak whores to join their legions on false promises... peace to you and all you love)

I disagree:
"being civilised" is playing by their rules and that did not get us very far since 2008 did it? Being cilivised means you get to sit in the front rows in a church where all the biggest whores congregate while the *known* whores have to sit in the back. Btw, I like sitting in the back: it is closest to the exit.
"don't write on [...] money"... now tell me who started writing on *our* money from the times of us carrying our own gold/assets? who of us voted to have their propaganda stamped on the fruits of our labour, starting with coins with pictures and up to the bills we are forced to look upon every day multiple times... talk about indoctrination, heh
"use vocal arguments" gets you killed if you gain any traction. Ask Jesus Christ, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Mahatma Ghandi, Benazir Bhutto, etc. Why do you think Satoshi Nakamoto chose to stay anonymous? Please read some applicable history:  .
love and peace to all

FYI: The last documentary, the VPRO (which losely translates into 'Free Progressive Radio Broadcast) produced ([*not* by Ver]( docu 'Bitcoin Gospel', is made in 2015 before the BitcoinCash issue when mr. Ver (/s) was still considered 'Bitcoin Jesus'. It's a historical document(ary). One can see how mr. Ver, and other notables, felt about bitcoin at that time. One can also see near the end of the docu  an indication that mr. Ver is then already slightly unhinged so to speak. Diving into mr. Ver's personal history (for instance why he was send to prison) further indicated a personal problem mr. Ver has with the world as he sees it. We have all seen this personal problem with authority escalate in the wild. Do not skip this docu just because he's in it somewhere. Like I said above **mr. Ver did not make this docu** although that is falsely stated in the Cryptoverse article. Please enjoy it.

I'd think using ATMs ,aka BTMs (see [ &amp; [ ) to get crypto from fiat into a DEx (decentralised exchange) could cut it. I found a nice DEx list (inDEX) the other day at [ that should get you going. You can also just stick your newly bought crypto in wallets that you control (meaning have the private keys of) if you're not going to trade crypto A for crypto B anyway. Remember "not your keys, not your bitcoin" ( [ ).
On a side note, I also wonder why the financial institutes that be want KYC and AML to regulate and check us, while they do not seem to be able to use those same regulation to regulate themselves and each other. The crimes they get away with on each others watch make me want to stay as far away as possible from them. It is us, the bank's customers, that pay all those fines and fraudulent losses remember. I certainly do not trust them to be fair to us little people.
On top of that they get hacked (true or not) all the time and "lose" copies of the personal information that we are obligated to entrust to them making us possible victims of fraud. They don't care nor feel responsable for any harm that could come from say ID fraud. I'd rather avoid all that and at the same time be myself master over my own earnings and wealth.
That's how I feel.
