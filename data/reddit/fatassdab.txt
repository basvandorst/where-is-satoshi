with the lightning network, you are only using on chain transactions to set up the payment channel, so essentially, once more and more payment channels are set up, less need to be set up to get the transactions where they need to go. I can't really answer that question 100% but coinbase can already do some things to decrease their impact on the network (segwit/batching txns). Aside from establishing new payment channels on-chain, LN transactions are essentially free and instant.
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:47:21
as far as i know any coin that is segwit enabled can use LN

calm down Mark, nobody is saying TA can predict the future. It's simply finding trends that may or may not continue and making a trade based off that trend. If you can manage your risk/reward you can be very profitable, TRADING ISN'T FOR EVERYONE.
Just because you've never made a good trade in your life doesn't mean everyone loses every single trade they make.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:47:14
I'll say it again. If you can afford 21 BTC right now, I'm sure you will be able to retire comfortably doing what you're currently doing. If you spend over $210,000 in a year and you can't retire, you have a massive fucking problem with your finances.

that's because we're poor, a 2% loss in purchasing power per year is hardly noticeable when you live essentially paycheck to paycheck. 
The rich and elites that have excess money will always take advantage of the poor when the economy turns for the worst by buying up their assets for cheap they were forced to sell to continue living their lives in the fucked up economy. 
Then the rich get richer when the economy turns around and the poor people are still left struggling while the media runs 100 stories about how the economy is BOOMING and doing so well.
These mega rich people are absolutely worried about that 2% loss so they continue buying assets that poor people can't even afford.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:29:59
I always like to add that certain crypto gambling websites allow you to swap tokens for a few % fee with no KYC as well, [luckygames.io]( is one that I have trusted many times over the last 2 years but definitely check the exchange rate between the 2 coins you want to swap before finalizing it because i've seen spreads of over 5% before.
I don't suggest gambling there though, you will always, always, always lose in the end. It is a casino.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:37:05
TA isn't bullshit, it's just supposed to give you a potential edge over your position. 
If there is a trend and you make a trade based on that trend, you know that when the trend fails you were wrong and can exit the trade.
TA is not a crystal ball, it's just supposed to find potential opportunities to make a low risk trade based on trends that may or may not play out.

thats called a buy wall to keep the price propped up, whales use these to trick people into buying because they think the wall will protect them from downward price movement but then the whales remove the wall and the price starts falling, then the whales hope you sell for a loss so they can scoop up your coins.

@_date: 2019-07-08 17:05:58
I use IDEX, and haven't ran into any problems (except for the lack of liquidity sometimes), if you have an ethereum metamask wallet or a hardware wallet like a ledger nano then it's really easy to do and is pretty self explanatory. The DEX is just a smart contract running on ethereum that allows you to initiate trades within the contract using your private key to sign the transactions. (this is why DEX's are safe, because your funds are stored safely in a smart contract and can only be manipulated/signed by you using your ethereum wallet key to sign. (this is why having a metamask or hardware wallet is extremely useful)
So you set up your wallet on the exchange.
Then you deposit some ethereum into the DEX smart contract from your metamask/hardware wallet.
You will need some ethereum within the contract to initiate trades and pay the gas fee for transfers back to your wallet as well as purchase coins.
Once you're done, you can transfer the coins back into the ethereum wallet you used to create the DEX wallet.
Just make sure you have some ethereum left when you're done trading and also make sure you're reaching the minimums for withdrawls on whatever DEX you choose to use. You don't want to deposit ETH into the contract and not be able to withdraw it because it's too little.
@_date: 2019-07-14 19:25:25

next halving coming in 322 days should get us at the very minimum over 20k if the macro trend continues, and 4 years after than will be the next halving. If BTC can remain relevant for 4-5 more years i would be very very surprised if it wasn't over 100k

You're trusting coinbase and robinhood to keep the coins safe until you do want to sell. So as long as you're okay with trusting them then I guess it's not that big of a deal.
Hacks and misuse of coins by company officials can happen though, but through coinbase your dollars should be safe (because coinbase is highly regulated) but you could lose access to the bitcoins because you can't just print more bitcoins if they lose them to a hack.
@_date: 2019-07-04 19:12:05

yeah but assuming he's just 1 person, theres no way he would be able to mine even 50% of all blocks. That automatically brings us to 280 days minimum to get 1M BTC.  I'm not saying it's impossible but the numbers just seem so high to me.
@_date: 2019-07-21 17:57:34
according to my math, mining 1 million bitcoin would take over 3300 hours, and that's assuming you mined every single block. So satoshi would've had to been mining basically every single second for the first year atleast to get that many BTC since there wouldve been more miners than just himself.
@_date: 2019-07-14 22:17:11
let me explain it like you're 5.
If you can afford to spend 210k right now, you probably have a decent job, meaning you don't even need to buy bitcoin to "be able to retire in the future".  
I can't tell if you're actually serious in thinking that I mean't retiring right now with 21 BTC would be comfortable, nowhere in my posts have said that.

once you save up like $500+ worth of bitcoin, buy a hardware wallet. 
It's pretty fun to mess around with and will make buying and storing bitcoin even more fun.
Also it's reassuring to know that you have complete control over your funds once you get them off coinbase.
@_date: 2019-07-04 20:04:22
If you've used it, you would know it's pretty much Bitcoin that is still possible to mine with GPUs.
Vertcoin doesn't promise any earth shattering tech like 99% of the actual shitcoins out there, it just simply exists as an option for people who don't want to buy an ASIC miner to actually contribute to a network and earn some coins using their gaming rig.
Plus down the line if lightning and atomic swaps ever gain some substantial ground, VTC will be part of that ecosystem just like LTC will.
Buy VTC, or don't, I don't care. I'm not here to try shilling bags, but VTC is not a shitcoin. 
For anyone who actually wants to learn about mining, the Vertcoin discord is filled with people (and the developers) waiting to help you out.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:15:34

bitcoin is 50% of my investment portfolio! But i do love myself some hot shitcoins. In my opinion, bitcoin is and will always be the father crypto with the highest market cap and most hashing power. But other shitcoins have the ability to increase faster %-wise in relation to bitcoin, which allows me to sell those for more bitcoin. Basically (in my opinion) with bitcoin you cant lose unless you sell or crypto dies so i choose to stay here.

yep, theres about 750k more bitcoins to be mined before the next halving (roughly 400 days). Once those are mined, there will be less than 3.5 million Bitcoins left available to be mined in the world until around 2140. That is an insane comparison if you think about how scarce freshly minted bitcoins are going to be. Now is the last chance we have to acquire Bitcoins at a reasonable price in my opinion.

Its called a wall to scare traders into thinking they need to put a sell order in ahead of the wall so their order will get filled. It causes sellers to panic, then the whales with the wall buy your coins for less, and then they remove the wall and everyone thinks its time to go to the moon so price goes up. Sellers get rekt and the whales get free gains because they scared people into selling.
Edit: also though, it could just be whales holding the price down, with no intention to remove it so trading whale walls is not a smart thing to do because you can get rekt easily.

Greyscale Bitcoin Trust, they own about 1% of the BTC supply and they use it to sell shares of their BTC to investors that don't want to directly hold their own crypto or trust a shady exchange. So there's a premium price on the GBTC (which is calculated in mBTC, so 1 GBTC share is like $14).

everything is stored on the blockchain.
with a ledger nano X, the ledger uses a function to produce a private key in such a way that it is completely random, and the ledger gives you a seed phrase which is 24 different words in a certain order. This seed phrase can be cryptographically turned into a private key so all you need to remember is the 24 words in order and you will be able to access the bitcoin which is stored on the blockchain. The ledger is basically a key that allows you to control your bitcoin that's stored on the blockchain.
Your private key is stored inside the ledger nano X, which is known to be pretty bulletproof so the only way someone would be able to access your funds would be if they stole your nano X and guessed your PIN in 3 tries or less (the device gets wiped on 3 wrong attempts), or if they get their hands or eyes on your 24 words.
The 24 word seed can be uploaded onto 100 different ledger nano X's, and all of them would be able to access the funds connected to that private key.
Does this clear anything up at all?

in the future you probably wont have to choose your fee amount for normal transactions, but even today most people do not choose their own fee's because most wallet automatically calculate it for you. Litecoin operates exactly like Bitcoin when you're transacting it but the fee will be probably $0.02 and it will get confirmed 4 times faster than a Bitcoin transaction which will make it seem faster to your friends.

lol sob story and a half
@_date: 2019-06-12 06:19:13
It could, but the fact that BTC becomes more scarce after the halving and the hype leading up to the halving usually causes regular people to buy up as much as they can before they become "rarer".
An important point to remember though is that if BTC is becoming unprofitable because the reward doesn't cover the costs, the least efficient miners will be the first to shut down.
When unprofitable miners begin to shut down, the difficulty to solve future bitcoin blocks gets easier for the profitable miners so they're still making money. Which is really nice because the cheapest electricity is renewable so hopefully BTC can spark new life into parts of the world with tons of potential for cheap renewable energy.
Mining will always balance itself out due to the difficulty adjustment, but it is only adjusted after 2016 blocks, so transaction speeds will only be minorly affected if there is a dramatic drop in hash rate for 2 weeks. That being said, BTC really is no longer about transaction speeds, it's more about security due to the fact that there is so much hashing power pushing new blocks every 10 minutes with extremely high difficulty that no single person or group or government could afford to attack and profit from it short or long term.
Other coins that are forked from Bitcoin have halvings (Like Litecoin, for example) but the coins you listed are mostly other forms of blockchains with consensus algorithms that are not Proof of Work like Bitcoin. Ether is Proof of Work but it is moving to Proof of Stake which is a whole other realm of consensus and "mining" that i'm not going to go into because I'm not an expert on the different forms of Proof of Stake. IOTA is a DAG (directed acyclic graph) which is another complicated version of a blockchain that I don't fully understand to be honest, I would head over to the ethereum and iota reddits to learn about Proof of Stake or DAGs

Not everyone who is a democrat believes in socialism, and depending on the candidate they end up with will force a lot of those dems to vote red or they just wont vote because their candidate didn't win the primaries. \*addition\* and on the flip side, all the republicans are voting for trump pretty much.

because you're paying to ensure miners will continue to secure your transactions on the blockchain, so that you can continue to transact freely with no central figure saying yes or no.
With no incentive, there is no security, with no security, you have no value.
You're paying because you can guarantee that the money has been transferred 100% securely, undoubtedly. (atleast with BTC since it has the most hashing power and can absolutely not be successfully attacked)
With all that said, this is still 100% an experimental project and it's definitely not perfect or even close to it. But if you want to have some fun and send some coins around I personally would use Litecoin because it's cheaper and faster and you get generally the same experience compared with Bitcoin as of today.

to be fair OP, if you weren't around every day during the bear market like a lot of us were and buying in the 3-4k range you can't be mad that you're forced to fomo in when you remember about bitcoin after it's already tripled since the bottom.
@_date: 2019-06-29 00:34:01
you don't know what satoshi would've done in every situation, maybe satoshi "left" because satoshi was forced to by someone he thought he could trust.

how many McChickens you can buy with 1 BTC is the purchasing power
@_date: 2019-06-12 05:30:49
Also to add to this, the original block reward was 50 BTC, and 210,000 blocks were mined with that reward. That means in the first 4 years, 10,500,000 BTC were mined... That's half of the total supply of all BTC that will ever exist (21,000,000).
The next 4 years, the reward was 25 BTC and 5,250,000 were mined. (75% of all BTC has been mined at this point)
Currently the block reward is 12.5 BTC, we will mine a total of 2,625,000 BTC within these 4 years and as of right now we have mined a total of  17,754,325 BTC. (84.5% of all BTC that will ever be mined).
As you can see the available supply is quickly drying up and will only happen faster and faster as time goes on until we've reached maximum adoption, then IDK what happens after that. lol

think about this, for you to even get a 10x return bitcoin would need to be $70k, that could take awhile but its a pretty "safe" investment as far as cryptocurrencies go. If you're looking to turn $60 into something significant i would NOT invest it in bitcoin, and i would invest in an altcoin that you think will skyrocket. If you want slow "somewhat guaranteed" returns over time i would choose bitcoin

Bitcoin can never fully replace fiat, at least right now. If Bitcoin was the only accepted currency then that means you would have to have access to the internet (blockchain) to buy/sell something

back in the beginning, all blocks contained 50 bitcoins. so to get 10,000 bitcoins it would take 200 blocks which is 2000 minutes or 33.33 hours minimum worth of mining.

@_date: 2017-11-04 16:30:06
maybe because you can buy bitcoin at any price instantly? try providing the same service coinbase does and see how well it works out for you
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:26:48
find me another website where i can punch in my debit card and get bitcoin instantly. 
Edit: also coinbase is the reason so many people are able to get into crypto, its so easy to use a 3rd grader could figure it out.
Anyone planning to hold bitcoin long term wont care about a puny fee for buying, anyone trying to trade via coinbase is a complete idiot but that isn't what coinbase is for.
@_date: 2019-06-12 05:13:39
I hope you're serious because here it goes. Every 210,000 blocks (this takes roughly 4 years because each block takes roughly 10 minutes) the reward for mining each block gets reduced by 50%.This means after the Halving, there will be half as many new BTC created through mining for the next 210,000 blocks. (currently 1800 BTC are mined every day, after the halving only 900 new BTC will be mined per day)
Now, since we know the supply is decreasing, and at the same time BTC is gaining more interest around the world, we can pretty much expect the price to rise as a result of these two things. (more people want to buy, less coins available)
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:34:00
Well considering bitcoin was created to be a currency i think its obvious that is what im talking about.
Edit: also you people sound like i want bitcoin to fail, that’s obviously not true, why would i have 75% of my crypto portfolio in BTC?

@_date: 2019-06-28 23:53:21
people can figure out your email pretty easily on the internet nowadays, so all it takes is 1 good phishing email from a fake exchange or something and next thing you know your computer has a keylogger or something and they figure out your passwords, etc.. My advice would be to store on a hardware wallet so it's not even possible to get phished, just dont store your 24 word seed on a PC. lol best of luck brother, enjoy the ride, but stay safe.

it does tell you upfront, before you buy it, with the confirmation box.... Also coinbase isn't a typical exchange. you aren't buying coins straight from another trader
Edit: all your negative ideas of coinbase are coming from the fact that you can't trade bitcoin 5 minutes apart and make money which is absolutely not what coinbase is for anyways.

just buy anything with the name Bitcoin in it and it will pump. I wish i was joking.  
okay im joking, but seriously do some research and you'll figure out which coins you want to put money into on your own.  
I try to lightly invest in as many types of cryptos as i can incase one pops off down the line. Checkout Decentralized Finance coins, gaming coins, gambling coins, smart contract coins, layer 2 solutions, privacy coins, DAGs, etc... seriously do some research and you wont have to ask anyone where to put your money because you'll probably run out of money before you can invest in all the different coins you've looked into lol.
TL;DR.. just buy some BTC and hodl it if you're too lazy to research other coins you personally believe in.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:49:01
if you don't like it don't use it I guess.. but there are lots of people who happily use coinbase all the time.. they just aren't worried about selling

if you're talking about coinbase, use "coinbase pro" ( [pro.coinbase.com]( ) for market value trades. It's the real exchange they own and you can transfer your coinbase funds straight to it with no fee's (because coinbase owns it, no coins are actually even moved)

just zoom out and look at the chart, if the price is near where it was when it started going up to 20k last time... then i would say it has gone down a lot. Vice versa, if the price has gone up 500% since the last correction.. it might be a good time to sell some off because you've profited. Nobody can give any exact numbers, you just have to use your head and think realistically and without emotions.

The thing that gets me is when people think that blockchain can exist securely without Bitcoin. I was reading the comments and people claim "the only real value is the blockchain technology! Bitcoin is just a ponzi scam"  but what they've failed to realize is that for an immutable ledger to stay immutable it must be protected by decentralized hashing power. No monetary reward... no mining... no mining... no security... no security.. no point in the blockchain.

Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins. If they're on the exchange, YOU DO NOT OWN ANYTHING. Its the same as unrealized profit when you havent sold your BTC, you haven't profited until you sell. You haven't gained ownership until you send them to a wallet.

yes, i am also stuck in this mind set. I don't believe Bitcoin can survive with the constant clogging of the mem pool and txn fees growing over a dollar (anything over a dollar is astronomical in terms of a crypto transaction in my eyes) constantly. I don't trust either other party BCH or BSV to sell my BTC for those coins even though their chains can handle the transaction volume without the high fees. FeelsBadMan sometimes.

i work in the cannabis industry in Oregon, I get a paycheck via direct deposit every 2 weeks like a normal employee. 
Some dispensaries accept debit cards with a fee (usually like $3 or $4) but there are a lot of new companies that offer these "cannabis gift cards" where you can reload them with your debit card and if the dispensary supports that service you can pay with it instead of cash.\\
But yes, there is a ton of cash because most people pay cash and cannabis industry employees are not allowed to legally carry a gun on any licensed property (in a dispensary, cannabis distribution warehouses, in transport vehicles, growing operations, etc..)   which is a big problem for myself, because I've had to transfer $50,000+ across the state in a work van, with nothing to defend myself with.

I think you should leave 10 bitcoins to each child and then spend whats left of the 81 bitcoins on some fun stuff or home/car improvements, debts, etc.
I would sell 50 coins and put that money in some other low risk investment in case bitcoin goes kaput for some reason. 
Then I would HODL the rest until you want to sell them (probably when you retire).
At this moment I would make sure someone would be able to access the coins in case something bad happened to you, or else your family would never be able to use them.

thats why dollar cost averaging is good, buy a little bit every week if you think its going to go down.. but you don't know how far it will dip, what if it doesn't dip as far as you thought and it starts going back up? then you missed out on buying opportunities. The idea is to always have fiat to invest when the price is going down so you can average your spending as well as catch the near bottom of the dip.

if it were simple to steal anyones bitcoins from coinbase, then it would be happening to everyone.. it sounds like you leaked sensitive information (at some point in time) which caused your coinbase account to be compromised, what does not make sense to me is if you were locked out of your account for 2 years, what did you tell the "hackers" recently that allowed them to finally steal the coins? nothing you've said really makes sense so i'm trying to get a better understanding of what happened

you're placing a sell ORDER, people can buy increments off your sell ORDER, it doesnt need to be bought all at once, that would cause a lot of problems for people trying to sell a lot at one time.

a lot of people suggest depositing cash into coinbase via bank transfer and then transferring that usd to GDAX (which is coinbase's trading exchange, if you have a coinbase account, you automatically have a GDAX account) and then buying bitcoin from the gdax exchange to avoid coinbase's exorbitant fees. Then you just send that bitcoin to your desired wallet and then HODL.

what does it matter whether it's efficient, the price of bitcoin relates to the difficulty to mine, if it cost less electricity to mine people would just get more mining hardware and use more electricity, and the hash rate would still continue to rise even if bitcoin used 1/100th the amount of energy per hash.

I agree but I don't think comparing a decentralized distributed ledger for storing and exchanging personal value and a fictional monster trading card game works out well. Bitcoin has actual utility that can drastically affect the financial and political powers we all live under.
Of course Bitcoin would lose value if demand stagnates, I'm willing to take that risk on this investment.

i think this halving will shake a lot of people out too early, I'm expecting BTC to start tanking a bit right before the halving just like LTC did. But, maybe a week after the halving price will explode the other way for round 2, leaving tons of people without BTC who thought the top was in.
Obviously its just a guess, but I want to believe market manipulation is going to get extremely intense since so many people think any coins bought before the halving is free gains

I told her may 5th again she really should pick some up to lower her average (btc was 5700 that day)... aaand now we're over 7k and I can just see it coming, she's going to let me know she bought more when we're well over 10k and the news is talking about it.

Dollar cost average your buys with money you never plan to touch in the short term and you'll appreciate a dip rather than fear it because your goal is to gain more bitcoin without risking your bitcoin, and what i just explained is a great way of doing that if you believe in BTC long term.

Americans who went to canada for cheaper pharmaceuticals did so legally and paid for what they came for, and then left back to the country they came from.
They don't take jobs, i never said they did buddy, I literally said some are coming just to take advantage of our social programs. I think it's terrible business owners have the ability to take advantage of all these illegal aliens, by paying them lower than minimum wage, but we keep letting them come in undocumented which only perpetuates the problem.
We have almost a 1 million people long legal immigration wait list because the illegal immigrants keep butting in front of everyone else trying to do it the right way.
You think I'm a racist or xenophobe but I'm actually just being realistic. We need to solve the illegal immigration problem before we can work on quality legal immigration.

yes, we need to be open to teaching new people about the best ways to use crypto. This bull market is going to bring in tons of new people with lots of seemingly stupid questions; but we're here every day so it's common knowledge for us.

hodlers actively participate in the market by removing traded circulating supply, each time a new hodler buys, thats less pie for the traders to trade.

I'll just put some FACTS here, I don't want to debate or argue.  
Dems are pushing for any and all forms of abortion, even after the child has been born. (Yes you heard that right, and you can look it up) I'm not against rape abortions by any means obviously, I actually care about people's well being.
Illegal immigrants DO commit many crimes, you just don't hear about it because the media is controlled by the left. Why didn't we hear about the shooting in Colorado anymore once it was revealed the shooters were gay and trans persons? Because it doesn't fit the narrative.  
Last month, a sheriff was killed by an illegal immigrant in Washington, the first on duty death in over 40 years. Guess who killed him? Juan Manuel Flores Del Toro, an illegal immigrant. So illegal immigrants actually DO commit crimes.  
A note about these camps you talk about, you want to know why we have to have these camps? because illegal immigrants are flooding into the country and we can't keep up. The backlog is already up to 850,000 which means we're dealing with ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS instead of helping LEGAL IMMIGRANTS get citizenship. How is that fair to anyone trying to become a citizen the correct way?
Gun control will lead to more deaths. You see what they did with the stupid GUN FREE ZONE signs? over 90% of mass shootings happened.... IN GUN FREE ZONES.
Criminals don't and won't follow the law, and a police officer with a gun isn't going to be able to save you when he's over 5 minutes away, sometimes they just don't even show up.  
I wan't you, your mom and your grandmother to be able to protect yourselves from any rapists and assaults no matter how big or scary they are. Which is why I believe so strongly in owning a gun, the ultimate equalizer.

Obama shut the government down, not sure where you get your information.
Walls do work for the ones crossing the border that way.  (which would help ease the economic pressure we've put on ourselves for helping these leeches)
Colossal waist? are you fat shaming?
All else aside, I agree capitalism isn't perfect, nothing about any government is perfect. But I'm not okay with getting taxed to pay for little Juan Pablo who just hopped the border from Mexico's college and healthcare. It all starts with secure borders, we don't even know how many illegal people are in the country.. how are we supposed to account for anything if they just keep coming in from poor countries and siphoning our tax dollars out of socialist programs.

I'll also add, do not send your whole bitcoin stack from coinbase to your new wallet in one transaction because you want to save a bit from transaction fees. 
Ensure yourself that you know how to correctly send a transaction to your new wallet and how to send a transaction FROM that wallet before you send all your funds to it.
@_date: 2019-05-18 03:00:20

Well since you're ignoring everything I'm saying, what are PoW's weaknesses? And please don't get sidetracked on the creative philosophy that energy consumption is bad for the environment. 
Not all energy is non renewable. So again what are its weaknesses?

i picked one recent incident that was not covered by the mass media, I'm not about to sit here and dig up all the evidence about illegal immigrants committing specific crimes that you would consider worthy of noting, because lets be honest, even if i did find 10 recent crimes that were actually covered in the media, you would just come back with another rebuttal.
Regarding gun control, I'll say this one more time incase you missed it. CRIMINALS DO NOT AND WILL NOT FOLLOW THE LAW.
We have almost 400 million hand guns in the USA, that's almost half of all handguns in the world (and this is obviously just an estimate, we have no idea how many illegally obtained black market guns are in the world). We have more handguns than humans in this country. If you really think stripping LAW ABIDING CITIZENS of their one way of protecting themselves, leaving CRIMINALS the only people left with guns is going to save lives, then you're honestly delusional. Criminals who didn't turn in their guns will now be able to rob you without even having to worry, they'll be long gone before any cops show up.
Also I'm not sure if you know this but the USA admits more LEGAL immigrants yearly than any other country in the world, and the number hasn't decreased with trump. Nobody that supports trump or the wall thinks immigration is bad, we think ILLEGAL immigration is bad, it's like trying to stop a faucet from running by holding bowls underneath to collect the water instead of turning off the FLOW and cleaning up the mess.

wouldn't it be possible for customers of the crypto bank to see that their coins haven't actually been lent out to someone? obviously this wouldn't be in the banks best interest but i'm imagining your "account" would just be a custodial wallet specifically for you with only your balance in it so you could view it at all times on the explorer.

OP, think about down the line when BTC does hit 80k, how many regular people will be able to fork out 8k for 0.1 BTC? not many. which will put you in a better position than most for the next bullrun after that. You might feel like a small fish now but just give it time and you'll be happy you managed to scrape up even 0.1 BTC
@_date: 2019-05-12 19:32:20

OP if you're still reading comments on this thread, don't invest your bitcoin in anything. It's simply not worth the extra risk, you're already risking your dollars on bitcoin so why would you risk getting your bitcoin stolen? You'll make plenty of gains if it goes up in price, don't let greed screw you over.

I'm not here to defend American spending habits, so I will assume a HUGE reason is due to people living far above their means.

Obviously walls wont work for the aliens already here, or any that choose to overstay their visas (these people have been identified already by the government)  but the dirt poor ones with no skills coming across the desert with nothing but shoes on for a free ride in USA (the ones that are going to be using public resources the most) will be met with a huge wall.

next time bitcoin is going down for a year and then starts running sideways, thats when you know it's time to buy. Buying now after it's already been trending upwards for over 2 months is a risk that you have to justify on your own.
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:18:00
first of all, don't do anything yet. Your coins are safe with coinbase for the time being, but take this time (don't rush) to learn a bit about different NON CUSTODIAL wallets. You're on the right track, a trezor or a ledger nano are supposedly highly secure and require a little bit of tech savvyness and also cost a fair bit.  
I'm not going to suggest any phone wallets because i have no experience with them, but just wait for some replies and then DYOR ( Do Your Own Research ) to make sure it's not some scam wallet, and from there you can figure out what wallet will work best for you.
@_date: 2019-05-20 03:54:29
some guy bought up 21k bitcoins supposedly and that propelled us from 4k to 5k if you look at the chart closely it just skyrockets up out of the depths of hell, and then sentiment shifted from that point on.

your best bet is using one of the highly regulated exchanges like gemini or coinbase if you're looking for one that's least likely involved with fraud.

Implying PoW wastes energy is false, energy isn't a finite resource and having PoW allows anyone to harness the cheapest energy in the world (these are almost always renewable resources like wind and hydro electric) and profit from it. This creates an incentive for mining businesses to operate in areas that would have no business otherwise, and are currently wasting energy because it doesn't get used by anyone. 
PoW promotes clean energy production, development, and competition which is good for everyone and the earth.
PoS promotes hoarding wealth and ensures the richest, earliest investors stay the richest.

i had just started throwing sheckles at BTC again when it dipped from 6k to 4k, got a little play money out of a totaled vehicle and was putting bits of it in every time i saw the price drop a little, then ended up throwing the rest of it at BTC, sadly at $4300 because i felt the markets sentiment had turned around, i had been dropping small bits on sub $3800 for a little bit, should've just bought it all at once with my gut feeling :(
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:50:18
 
guaranteed by the way
edit: also how are you "swapping" to a lower cap coin? if you're on an exchange with KYC they will know about your separate stash.
