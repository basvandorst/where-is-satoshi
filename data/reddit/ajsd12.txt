But there is a limited supply in BTC. A major position in BTC relative to the existing supply is what I mean. The market cap will increase over the years increasing the power of those who have soaked up a majority of the supply.

I'm just going to call it - the Fed has a Nation State size position in BTC and BTC has always been a CIA sponsored project to rid the world of fractional reserve banking and return the USA to the dominant country it once was. Leaving the Gold Standard in 1971 destabilized the world economy and BTC was the designed path back to stability. The USA has been holding a MAJOR position in BTC all along. Large enough to once again become the most powerful country in the world in due time.

The 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average is a rare Bullish signal that has not been seen since the beginning of the 2016 upward price momentum. It's essentially a rare bullish indication that the market is gaining momentum in a bullish trajectory.

It's not a matter of regulation, but a matter of control over a world reserve currency. Once BTC becomes the new reserve currency, the nations that have the largest BTC reserves will be able to lend the reserves to other countries creating a debtor/creditor relationship which as history shows is how power is distributed between nation states globally.

Exactly. All indicators are lagging, therefore showing evidence of past price action which allows you to make probabilistic assertions on future price movements.

This is a perfect example of the power of Bitcoin! I've never been more Bullish. Zimbabwe sees BTC as a major threat to the concentration of corrupt power and enslavement to their people in the country. 
Let's all go to Zimbabwe w/ a bunch of smartphones loaded up with BTC and distribute them around the country. Or hell, let's do it for every country on the African continent!

@ RIMS_REAL_BIG You know what the best insurance policy is? You actually becoming wealthy. Imagine you earning enough $ to take care of yourself. Crazy idea, right?

Need a series of higher highs and higher lows to confirm reversal. It will happen eventually, but no telling when. Just have to wait and watch (and HODL).
For a reversal - A downtrend, which is a series of lower highs and lower lows, reverses into an uptrend by changing to a series of higher highs and higher lows.

@_date: 2018-04-17 05:57:36
Custody aside - I think the more important thing to note is that we are seeing a new reserve currency being born. Dollars were always pegged to Gold until Nixon dismantled that relationship w/ the Bretton Woods agreement in 1971. If BTC is to be a self stabalizing economy, once 21 million are fully mined and introduced into the economy, it will be a very reasonable stable asset to peg dollars to.

Alright, so if you are a low volume trader (less than 5 BTC) you will be paying the maximum 1% for a 30 day period? 
For example -  If you fill a market buy order of 1 BTC @ $10,000 and this is the only trade you conduct in a 30 day period, your fee will be $100. Right?
If you trade over 5 BTC that fee goes down to .75. 
Does that sound right?
This kind sucks. Now I feel more incentivized to trade on Binance using their BNB token to take advantage of their 50% reduced fees.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but your BTC if on a Trezor or Ledger is on locked on the blockchain and can only move with the signature of a private key stored on the hardware device. Your BTC should not be able to move from its locked location on the blockchain without the signature and usage of your private key. The Trezor &amp; Ledger is simply a way to access your holdings and without it, there is no way of moving it.
