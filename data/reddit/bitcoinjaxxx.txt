How come I i can’t withdraw for 30 days?
@_date: 2018-10-28 23:56:51
33% monthly thinking of upping to 55-66%
@_date: 2018-10-29 12:17:13
Yea might as well risk $1,500 dollars to gain 
.21 its worth the risk if you ask me.

Thanks, I’m experiencing with eth-usd. I want $50 worth, using post limit. It says insufficient. I really don’t know how this works

20k 
@_date: 2018-10-29 12:02:07
Billions if not trillions. If you own .21 you’d be part of the 1% sooo figure it out. Let us know what you think

I didn’t clarify because I figured no bitcoin no other crypto. I’m going on 22 hrs no sleep atm. I think stocks want to invest in bitcoin because of high risk n high reward in the first place��

You have to keep it on Coinbase for about a month though. And yo pull it off line after the month of waiting on Coinbase he should send it to a coinbasepro account first. Correct?

I’m trying to get at least 1 bitcoin maybe two by April 
@_date: 2018-10-23 19:54:52
So no gold, bonds, stocks, 401ks? I think I would invest in start up companies presumably either some place that has a supply of something like tazinite or video games or rap music

1 btc = 1 btc

@_date: 2018-11-03 16:36:01
Hodl 
@_date: 2018-11-06 13:09:19
Not even after an economic collapse?
@_date: 2019-01-25 12:34:54
They probably benefit greatly in the end regardless 
@_date: 2018-11-17 10:27:25
Buy bitcoin. Btc not bch
Buy now and hodl. 
In about two years 2k could be $20k-$200k.
