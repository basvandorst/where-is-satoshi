It's often said that Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) have no intrinsic value.
Wrong. Bitcoin's blockchain itself is its intrinsic value, because: [**1**] The blockchain proves ownership of coins for everyone using the same network. And [**2**] cryptocurrency networks allow people to transfer wealth across any distance, to anyone else on the network, without censorship, in a timely manner.
These 2 traits combined, give cryptocurrencies a fundamental utility that cannot be replicated with anything else in the world -- not by tulips, not by fiat, and certainly not by gold.

Bitcoin technically isn't "purely peer-to-peer".
It's more like peer-to-node-to-peer.

There are literally hundreds of millions of Bitcoin users, and how many full nodes exist in the world? Barely 3000? The vast majority of Bitcoin users are connecting through these nodes, rather than directly with their end destination.

Banks can and have been proven to:
* forcibly seize or freeze money in user accounts
* accidentally add/remove random amounts of money from user accounts
* prevent people from withdrawing funds in times of economic turmoil (Argentinian banks during their financial collapse)
* prevent people from transferring money to certain exchanges
* prevent people from purchasing from certain merchants
The money that you put into a bank isn't yours; it's the banks, and you let them do as they please with it. Everything seems fine, until someone at the bank tells you "no".
In comparison, the money you put into your cryptocurrency wallet is **always yours**, and will stay yours until you decide to move the money somewhere. No one can forcibly seize your money, no one can tell you how to spend it.

By your definition, I guess only "physical" things have value right? Any content created digitally is worth absolutely nothing: movies, e-books, digital paintings, Steam games, mp3 files -- all just worthless code, that should be given away for free, because since they're digital, they have no economic value. Sounds pretty stupid, no?
Via blockchain technology, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies solve the [double-spend problem]( for the digital realm. Think about it; that is huge. Prior to cryptocurrencies, there was no method to 100% prove you transferred value over the internet. Blockchain is what gives cryptocurrencies their intrinsic value.
