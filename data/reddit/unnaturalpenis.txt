Electrical Engineer here - flash memory has to be "re-energized" every so many years, as the tiny memory cells are capacitors, they slowly leak/drain and need to be reflashed to prevent loss of data.  I'm talking 10+ years... But that is exactly how long it might be before that flash drive is worth a million.

While I agree, I just hate to see it get termed a "Darknet" one day.  I'd rather it become like Reddit as a flourishing community, with some dark corners.
@_date: 2014-11-05 14:33:05
We agree then.  Clap.
Though I know lots of people buy btc for making purchases, I and many others do not. Why would I want to, when I can simply use my linked amazon or paypal account without fees.  Few merchants give enough BTC discount to warrant the annoying process.  I fear the buying season up ahead will not necessarily help the price, but like you said, just inflate the volume.
However, I know lots of people that want BTC for christmas, etc, might be a lot of BTC purchases that are presents within themselves.  We'll know this if the BTC price drops shortly after christmas when all the high school and college kids spend it on the darknet - which is still thriving week by week, month by month.

tell your friend not to take it anymore, and if it came from a doctor to talk to him, if it came from the darknets... well, it might not be modafinil.  There are rare cases of side effects with modafinil, but those who do experience them, it's usually bad for them to continue taking it.  There are other nootropics he can try.

the best search engine ever if you DON'T want tailored search results.  It's like Google and the other search engines combined and removed the worst features.  It'll bring the best search results anyone can search for the same string and get the same results.  
My results are tailored so well for my engineering searches that I prefer Google, if you didn't know how bad your searches are tailored, grab a friends laptop and try searching for the same stuff you've previously searched for on your computer.
