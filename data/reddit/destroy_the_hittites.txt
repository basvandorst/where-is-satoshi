Congratulations, while I can't confirm it yet, that does look likely to be a real number!
You've now overcome the difficult hurdles placed in front of ... every check cashing and money wiring storefront in the United States.
Now I get to badger you on your state by state. Some of those are pretty difficult from what I hear.

Already in r/dogecoin by another until corrupt mods delete.
The Ponzi scheme funds themselves were BTC and whatever the hell is going on certainly involves BTC as well as a bunch of alts.

Summary: (EDIT was whole-thread link by accident.)
Possibly part of the price drop - the bad feelings and drama have slowed the coin's progress, and they might be jamming up the market intentionally.

It is likely he is attempting to turn PayPal funds into coin before those PayPal funds are frozen.
My summary for those as haven't been following:

Forgive a bit of circumlocution in the title , avoids attracting their downvotes by name a bit.

A known troll! Such horror. Thanks, but weev is a known troll, I don't qualify.


There is no evidence you have legal counsel. Please ask your law firm to prepare a brief statement on their letterhead stating they are working on your compliance. You can't, because you have no lawyers.


Any known securities regulations? LOL. How about the unknown ones? You speak a lot of gibberish sometimes. Sporklin is worse.
I've seen some of the enquiries - the wrong questions from your "investors" receiving an irrelevant FAQ answer.
Please point to the actual "exemption" you claim to have. It will have a name and regulations surrounding it, but you just keep saying "exemption". You can't, because you have no exemption.

Yeah, your bullshit registration number. Where is the FinCEN MSB I can look up on their website, the one that counts? Where is something from the SEC about your nonsense inconsistent "exemption"? Your bs about looking for loopholes AFTER your securities violations was pretty funny. You don't even have a clue what correctness here looks like. You don't even have a fucking lawyer.
You're pretty funny. I'm having fun. I'm looking forward to the Daily Dot article.

Here is not moderated by scammers, and it involves BTC very much as well.
@_date: 2014-07-17 12:20:07
Your unlicensed money transmission and unregistered sales of securities probably voided the contract.

Can confirm Moolah as bad actors. SEC violations, no FinCEN and no sign of one...
Lot of bots and alts it looks like. They appear to have corrupted r/dogecoin moderation, most notably sporklin.

At a higher level, they may be interested in the growth of Bitcoin as a currency/payment system, which is helped by allowing many to mine. No ASIC manufacturer sincerely interested in Bitcoin would operate 51% capability for itself, for instance, since then Bitcoin would lose all trust.

I'm late but I guess I'll confirm the Board is free of Moolah corruption to the best of my knowledge.

They got kicked off Wells Fargo and now they're running out of a little credit union. What does that tell you?
@_date: 2014-07-03 06:23:43
Hey what can I tell you I'm just linking this one.
@_date: 2014-07-13 01:37:19
By all the laws of the United Kingdom, you are allowed to legally call yourself whatever you want. LOL.
You ain't allowed to run a Ponzi scheme though.
@_date: 2014-05-19 15:28:53
You're out of your element. Losing plausibility. What story did you give the credit Union?
@_date: 2014-07-03 06:07:11
@_date: 2014-05-19 22:02:21
Moolah seems to have a nice downvote squad. Guy definitely has a bunch of alts.
@_date: 2014-05-31 01:27:14
Yeah, I get to do what I want. Your now-available registration turns out to be truly filed, as I expect, but seems invalid. Wrong corporation, wrong financial activities. So I can just continue badgering you on that.
You also lied about having filed it long ago.
It's a fucking quick electronic form, you did it only because this was the first thing I chose to focus on. I enjoy making you dance.
