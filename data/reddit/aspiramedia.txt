You can use it straight away if that helps so from the senders and receivers POV it is pretty instant. (Not 100% sure what you mean by settled sorry - not sure I have the right end of the stick here.)
@_date: 2016-08-19 08:19:42
Oh yeah there are still reasons to use btc for sure. Speed probably isn't one in the UK right now. Banking apps are just as quick as btc really.
Reasons like not wanting it to appear on your online statement or be seen by spouse on their banking app etc. I think you'd still have to be verified by id to use it though so not total anonymity. 
@_date: 2016-08-19 06:32:25
UK bank transfers are really quick. Quoted by Faster Payments as a few hours but they tend to take minutes.
Still useful too use btc for other reasons of course. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 07:36:09
Not sure if it applies to credit cards and retailers too (anyone?) but here in the UK bank transactions use Faster Payments so transactions tend to happen within minutes, usually seconds in my experience. 
I naively assumed this was a global thing, which is why it took me so long to find the speed of bitcoin a merit.
@_date: 2015-06-10 10:58:18
Thanks for the clarification.
@_date: 2015-06-10 08:46:37
I'm honestly shocked at those random rules and regs. All of those things just seem crazy to me. Is that just your accunt or similar nationwide?
Now obviously having a bank account over here we end up making the bank money and probably get shafted here and there (I'm aware we are the product here) but you generally don't pay any fees on anything (transfers/withdrawals/cashpoints) - at least nothing I have encountered.
@_date: 2015-06-10 08:20:20
That's crazy. Yeah I figured the whole world worked like the UK initially but then realised how slow some countries are. Makes btc more attractive in those cases.
Here it doesn't matter what bank or account type it is our what time or day, you can just send money around in minutes free of charge. 
For clarity's sake, is a "checking" account an account aimed for having smaller amounts with less interest used for on the go stuff then?
@_date: 2015-06-10 08:41:02
Current account. Got it. Cheers.
Seems like a lot more contrived and restrictive than over here though based on here:
@_date: 2014-05-12 16:02:53
Yep TIL the UK's bank transfer system is quicker than most places by quite some margin, hence why I failed to see btc transaction times as an advantage.
@_date: 2014-11-21 11:04:10
Cheers for clearing things up for me.
@_date: 2014-10-02 08:42:04
Ouch just checked and it's about 8% higher than market value covered to USD. Pretty sure it wasn't that much when I bought. It is easy to buy though.
@_date: 2014-11-21 08:08:06
Am I understanding this correctly, but this implies you pay a fee to send someone money inside the US? 
Not trolling just curious.
@_date: 2014-05-12 16:00:39
Others have already come back on this one. I'm in the UK which has faster transactions by far than most places it seems. I was unaware of that. We can transfer money via banks in minutes, 24/7. I can transfer money from one account at one bank into another account in another bank and 5 mins later it is there. Sometimes a bit longer but not much.
That is why my original question came up as I didn't see the bitcoin transaction time as an advantage. In other areas it is seen as an advantage over banks.
@_date: 2014-05-12 07:43:12
I love Bitcoin and its properties but one thing that the community praises is its transaction time. It tends to take 30 mins when I send coins to places but I can send cash bank to bank in minutes. Why is the transaction time praised?
@_date: 2014-10-02 08:26:07
There are a few ways, localbitcoins and bittylicious were pretty good for me.
@_date: 2014-10-02 09:04:44
Isn't that a Euros market? I'm sure you could use it but not quite as simple right? I don't know much about Kraken.
@_date: 2014-05-12 14:28:49
Cheers buddy.
@_date: 2014-11-21 10:17:52
Is it not the norm over there then?
@_date: 2014-05-12 17:24:46
To be truly used globally it has to be much easier to use.
By use I mean get hold of, spend and store without issues. We're a long way off it being as easy a tech to pick up as a smartphone or similar.
I'm a techy guy and the btc world still seems like it needs a lot of work to make it use friendly. From wallets to exchanges to keeping btc safe.
@_date: 2014-05-12 12:14:23
Yes, I can. Any bank in the country. I can send money in minutes.
@_date: 2014-05-12 12:22:35
Yeah based on what people are saying the transaction time for online banking is different here. I assumed it was the norm.
@_date: 2014-02-04 08:42:38
I'm guessing that a fair number of visitors use mobile devices to browse. It's not always easy to see sidebar info depending on the app used. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 16:01:34
*Instant* no, but it takes only 5 mins usually. Sometimes a little longer if there is what I assume a busy period.
@_date: 2014-05-12 09:30:56
Thanks for this. I bought some btc off a site that wasn't an exchange and a person sent it to me but it appeared "spendable" in my wallet only after 30 mins or so. So I am a bit confused on this one. It wasn't an exchange but just a regular person sending it. Yes it showed as incoming in seconds on my wallet but I couldn't use it for 30 mins. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 08:45:12
Ah so sending internationally is the advantage. Sorry, I was thinking a bit local there. 
But locally I can send money in minutes day or night via the bank, doing it online. Might be just a UK thing though. Not sure.

"Can I pay in bitcoin? You can read up on it in this magazine. I'll leave a few here and there for your colleagues."

Not on computer right now but most adblockers have a list you can add to to allow ads. Might be site by site, not page by page though.
@_date: 2016-09-28 16:55:41
These can be reported to google (on mobile so not easy to find) but the issue is that they keep coming back. Google needs a better way to stop misleading sites appearing in AdWords.
If you use crypto I'd suggest an ad blocker so the AdWords stuff doesn't show.
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:03:44
What issues are you having with legit ads being approved?
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:09:06
I can't see that ad but you can report it here:
But there are tons of them for all crypto stuff unfortunately. I'd recommend using an ad blocker in case one catches you out one day.
@_date: 2016-05-06 18:56:05
I think data caps are a lot rarer than they used to be. I don't think many companies use them where I am. 
How much data per month is needed for this?
@_date: 2015-03-31 12:01:04
BTC is risky as an investment. So the question here to ask yourself is how much that 50k means to you. If you'd be devastated to lose that amount then use less risk or hold the cash. If that amount is child's play to you and you wouldn't be worse off if you lost it then go for btc.
Those are the two extremes. Ask yourself where you lie on this scale and you'll know your risk. Invest, or not, or partly accordingly.
@_date: 2015-03-11 08:40:20
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
@_date: 2015-10-14 17:00:43
If you are using volume you could use an average and avoid trades under certain conditions that seem fake to get around this.
@_date: 2015-03-29 09:00:39
Now that makes more sense when reading comments.
@_date: 2015-03-29 08:31:07
For these cards Google takes the most prominent and relevant result (bitcoin.org in this case)  and displays text fed from that site.
@_date: 2015-03-29 08:34:16
Curious, not trolling here:
Can someone explain why gambling in BTC online is seen as a huge thing in the US? As opposed to using USD via cards or PayPal? 
@_date: 2016-07-01 11:02:58
The chip and pin is universal here and probably a requirement. 
The online password might be less prevalent. Maybe other UK people could chime in here. Ones I have used either ask for 3 chars from your password or ask you to check your phone/dedicated password device (old way) for a confirmation code. 
People can still get around this on and offline though. Cash machines can have number readers in them whilst someone watches you put in your pin. Or dodgy payment terminals etc.
Online malware could expose your password if it is used in full hence the code that changes each time becoming more popular. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 10:50:13
UK. If you pay physically via a card you need to enter a pin number at the checkout. (Although contactless payments now exist for small transactions.)
Not sure if everyone has this but cards I've used online require a password when making a purchase. Maybe only the first time at a site though. Don't know the exact rules.
I'm not saying it's secure and to give out your numbers freely as I'm sure it's possible to get around. Just it's more secure than the post makes out. Is this not a global thing? (Not trying to be an idiot here, probably just ignorant.)
@_date: 2016-07-01 08:37:13
Whilst I agree it's less secure on occasions, your pin for in store payments and online usage password for online payments make it far more secure than this suggests. 
In a way it's a tiny bit like public and private keys. 
I'm not saying that either platform is  infallible or better or anything just that this is a tad misleading.
@_date: 2013-12-28 14:17:06
We broke it. Team effort. You sent the cash already?
@_date: 2013-12-28 14:07:58
Just happened the minute I tried to buy for the first time. Have no idea if my transaction went through which is worrying. Money left account then bam. Eek.
@_date: 2013-12-28 14:29:19
Well it seems to be up and running somewhat in the last few mins - I just got to confirm my payment again so hopefully it'll go through when the seller gets back online.
