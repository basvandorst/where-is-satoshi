They're the clear winners of the 2013 award too.

That realization was him understanding just how many cookies they usually give out at blood donor clinics he'll now be able to buy :)

Oh really? I wired my money 12 days ago to bitfloor and it still hasn't shown up in my account. Their customer service rep says it's not their fault and blamed it on the banks. Unbelievable.

I'm a manager at a progressive, reputable tech company and since I've taken a great interest in Bitcoins the past few months (just bought my first few coins this week!) I will be pushing them hard to look into implementing Bitcoin payments ASAP. 
So it's a great point OP, and I'll just add to it that any employees, managers, execs, etc. should also start to at least plant the seeds internally within your companies.

How did you lose them?

Just don't forget to livestream it for the rest of us outside NYC and Boston...

Just checked it out, but couldn't find any deposit locations in Canada - do you know if there are any?

Thanks for the detailed response. I just made my first purchase of a few coins early this week but they're now just "living" in my account on the site I bought them through. I assumed this wasn't a very secure method of storing them and will definitely have a look into these wallets now. Thanks again.

I found a local buyer on localbitcoins, but he only had a few in stock to sell, unfortunately.

Nope but I can check it out, thanks for the suggestion. Is it all just interac transfers on there?
@_date: 2013-03-28 08:17:21
Agreed, and I actually just posted in another thread about the importance of spreading the word both to companies you interact with as well as company(s) you work for. 
There's nothing more powerful than a company receiving high consumer demand as well as internal pressure from its employees to make a decision that will ultimately increase the bottom line.

What kind of steps can a newbie take to secure them?
@_date: 2013-03-30 04:12:09
well I actually have a cousin that owns 4 Timmy's locations. We have a good relationship and I know he has a direct line to the top. I'm seeing him next week and will explain the benefits and open his eyes to them. I'll do my best, thanks for the idea.
Edit: Just a tip to anyone trying to convince a business in a highly-competitive environment (like Tim Horton's, Wendy's, McDonald's, etc.) to adopt Bitcoins - always mention that this will give them a competitive advantage. These guys are ALL looking for ways to get a leg up on competition, so frame it in this way to increase your chances of success.

Ya, too bad, would love to purchase some coins but am finding it a bit of a challenge right now. Will continue trying though, I really believe strongly in the value Bitcoin will provide to this world over the next decade. Just wish it was a tad easier to acquire coins right now.
