Does Bitcoin Cash have any plans to implement lightning? I know they don't want Segwit, but maybe lightning is part of their scaling roadmap?
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:44:36
If someone who knows how to do stuff can just make a new website called ShmoinShmace which is identical to the original but uses Segwit addresses and doesn't have an agenda that'd be great.
Seriously though, the centralisation of fiat to BTC onboarding and offboarding is a massive risk. Coinbase has somehow managed to grab not only Bitcoin, but the whole crypto space by the balls. We shouldn't have to be begging them like this in a free market.
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:21:57
Essentially if you run a lightning node then you have to lock up funds in a channel. For doing this you can charge a fee (basically the small fee will grant "access" to route transactions through that lightning node). So you could consider the locked up funds as "staking" bitcoin, in order to get paid in routing fees. However it's different from POS in that you're not getting paid as a block reward. It's market driven, not dictated by the protocol.
(Someone please feel free to correct me on any of this but I think this is a reasonably accurate description).

Segwit is not a prerequisite for Lightning (it just makes it a hell of a lot easier.)

Depends how long you've had the BTC. If you had the BTC in the wallet prior to the fork, and the wallet supports the forked coin then yes. You'll have to check the website to see if they support the fork or are planning on supporting in the future.
Edit: i see you're talking about Segwit 2X round 2 (if it even occurs). Again, see the website. However, even if the wallet never supports it, you should still be able to retrieve your coins since you have possession of your private keys, it's just an extra step of importing them into a compatible SW2X wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:10:17
Bare in mind that this will not move the coins to a Segwit address however, only import the legacy address into the Electrum wallet. If you want to move the coins to a Segwit address, you'll have to either sweep or send to a Segwit address.

Send the bitcoin to a wallet which gives you possession of your private keys. Such as a hardware wallet or some software wallets (I think Armoury or Electrum but not 100% sure). Paper wallets will also do it but I don't know if there are any safe Segwit address paper wallet generators out there, and ideally if you're moving your coins from now you want to only use Segwit addresses.

If you're paying for goods from an account owned by the same entity as the payment processor, you're still paying with Bitcoin. It's just that the transaction doesn't have to be made on chain, because the trustlessness of the blockchain is not required because there is no second entity to trust.
It's like if you go into the shop owned by your parents on pocket money day. They have custody of "your" pocket money (let's say $5). It is by all accounts your money, it's just that they have possession of it. You want a $1 chocolate bar. What happens here? Well there's no point in them giving you $5 only for you to return $1. So you take the chocolate bar, and they now hold $4 of your pocket money. The fact that no money changes hands is analogous to the fact that no on chain transaction is necessary.
This analogy is accurate because technically if you're money is in a hot wallet, you don't own it. So money can be rerouted without fees by the wallet and payment processor (if they are the same entity, as in this case).
The lightning network essentially does exactly the same thing, but in a trustless manner using time locked multisignature payment channels.

A lot of currencies only work from the lowest denomination of their currency (i.e. they only have the equivalent of cents, no multiples like dollars) and it doesn't really cause any issues in practicality.

I have a question for anyone who might care to/be able to answer. We talk a lot about the block size but not about block time. Can the 10 minute block time be changed (lowered) and if so how would this affect things? I've read that the more frequent block times are beneficial for litecoin in terms of lower transaction fees. Could this also be employed with bitcoin and what would be the effect?

Worry not, friend. I'm all about the HODL and don't intend to sell when it dips.
I didn't sell the last dip. In fact, I bought...
I see what you are saying about not treating it as a regular investment - I agree that it's in no way a 'safe' investment. But if you believe that the value will be much higher, not necessarily in the short term, but certainly in the long term, then it's hard not to see it that way. That's why we HODL, right? Because we believe the price will rise. And if it dips, it dips. But whilst I believe in the potential of the technology and whilst the price is going in a general upwards direction in the long term.. I'm all in.
Edit: By "all in" I mean a sensible amount I can live with losing, of course.

Can you explain how they differ? What could cause something to be "verified" but not "confirmed"?
I understand in theory, that essentially verified means the transaction is added to the mempool but nodes have not yet validified it.
But, if I don't actually have the bitcoin in my wallet, then how can I even add a transaction to the mempool? What does one have to do to have a transaction added to the mempool but rejected by the nodes?
(Hopefully my question makes sense despite my limited knowledge of how this all works).

How can you do fractional reserve banking with bitcoin? Surely that's impossible?
I mean you could loan out money and then request interest, and that interest may or may not be repayable by the loan recipient. So debt can be created in the system, but surely the money has to at least be lent out in the first place, because you can't just invent bitcoin out of thin air like you can in the fractional reserve banking system?

I thought that the more hashpower, the more difficult the mathematical problem became, in order to keep the blocktime consistent.
Also, if this was a profitable way of mining, wouldn't you just limit the hashpower so that you always mine a roughly full block, and then a succession of empty ones?
Damn this shit is confusing.

Most of your Bitcoins will already be on the lightning network. The lightning network will be the default, you won't be paying to get "on and off" it each time in the vast majority of cases. The only transactions using the main chain will be specific use cases, i.e. very high value transactions requiring immutable proof.
Also Litecoin will never have the network effect of Bitcoin, and as lightning transactions make Litecoin more and more obselete, it will become increasingly unstable and over time drop in value.
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:50:47
Great response, thanks for sharing. But just to be clear. The actual fractional reserve bit is only possible due to the use of "promissory notes". If we're talking about a purist world in which only real BTC is used as currency, then this would make it impossible. But bitcoin itself, as a mathematical protocol, is immune to fractional reserve banking.

Ah ok I guess I misinterpreted what you were saying. I thought you were suggesting that you were guaranteeing that the drop will be lower than the current ATHs we're seeing.
I actually agree there will be a drop, but I think the price will climb a lot higher, and then correct to a slightly higher price than the current one. I think everyone waiting around for it to fall below $1.5k may be waiting forever, unless there is a serious and possibly existential political or technological threat to bitcoin, in which case it's probably best not to buy back in.

If that's the case, that the 2x part refers to a larger SegWit capacity increase and not a trueblock size increase, then why can it only be achieved from a hard fork?
I thought the whole Segwit 2x thing was about the core devs getting Segwit, and the miners getting their blocksize increase, as a compromise? What you're suggesting sounds like offchain scaling only, which is great but if that's what Segwit 2x implies then why didn't we already activate it via the UASF?

Thanks for taking the time to respond so thoroughly.
So is the ratio of traditional transactions and segregated witness data always 1:1? (Making it 4:1 after taking account of blockweight)?
If so why can't the block weight be increased to 2mb, therefore allowing 1.6mb of traditional transactions, and 0.4 mb of SegWit data? Why do we have to jump to 8?

I'm not sure that recommending dollar cost averaging could be characterised as "painting the rosy picture that bitcoin will always go up and up and up without risk".
In fact, its quite the opposite. You put in a little bit here and there without trying to catch a dip or chase a high.
What you are suggesting is that if the price goes down for even ten minutes that that is a loss.
Zoom out of the price chart for a minute. There are endless points where you would have lost money because the price falls. But so far it has always recovered. Could you have made a bit more if you caught the dip? Sure. But no one really has the foresight to do that. Even most day traders suck at it.
The important and sensible thing is to educate yourself on the technology and have a clear understanding of its potential, and then invest little by little what you can afford to lose - regardless of the price.

Well right now it's at the highest price ever. So, literally, right now, as we speak.. hodling has always worked.
The only thing that has worked better that out and out hodling, is catching dips. Which most people are completely unsuccessful at. But it's really one or the other. Either you HODL, or you catch dips. One has proven to be largely successful, and the other largely unsuccessful. Can you earn more shorting it and catching dips? Yes. But most people don't. So hodling is the best advice according to all available evidence on aggregate.
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:27:55
But you literally can bet all your bitcoins that a correction is coming.... sell.

But assuming there were no technical barriers, (which of course they are but sticking to the volatility thing for a moment) would it not make sense to switch to a currency with already a pretty sizeable market cap and which has the potential to increase in value massively. Currently the drachma is worth absolutely nothing, so at least bitcoin has a starting value. Either way it's gonna be crazy volatile. In fact I think putting the Greek GDP into bitcoin would be mutually beneficial. Because the bigger the market cap, the more able it is to absorb fluctuations in the market.
(Again, kind of playing devil's advocate here, just entertaining this thought train..)
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:29:02
Depends what your time frame and buying frequency is. The more you buy at the beggining (assuming a general price increase over time) the better.
Let's say a BTC is $10k to simplify it. For $10k if you want a whole bitcoin and you can't put it all in now (let's say you're setting the money aside from your salary and have a year overall) then you'd have to beat a price increase of about 2.5X from what it is now, assuming a bitcoin will be around $10k a year from now.
So whatever your initial buy is, you can probably expect to pay an extra 20% (or get 20% less BTC for your dollars) the next month to buy the same amount. On average.
So if you were to put, say $833 in every single month, you'd probably have a bitcoin after a year, but each month that $833 would buy you on average 20% less BTC.
This is of course not taking into consideration a lot of possibilities of price fluctuations. But a rough estimate.

@_date: 2017-08-18 20:10:38
In case you're wondering why it will affect decentralisation, the reason for this is because bitcoin works by people all over the world running a "full node". Essentially decentralisation works by many people having a copy of the full ledger to verify transactions - this should not be in the hands of a few interested parties.
This ledger grows day by day, and if you allow for bigger blocksizes, then the ledger outgrows many of the smaller computers running a full node, or it can be restricted by internet bandwidth for ordinary people.
Therefore we cannot allow the size of the ledger to grow so that the "masses" can no longer run a full node, because it would centralise too much power in the hands of a few.
This is why most users and developers prefer "off chain" solutions. Whereby essentially many transactions take place on a second layer, and these are consolidated and settled on the main blockchain periodically.
If anyone else cares to chip in or correct anything I've said please be my guest.
@_date: 2017-08-18 07:12:13
Totally agree. There is an educational aspect to go along with cryptocurrencies. I but I think if we can educate people about this "magic internet money" thing and get peoole to believe in it, then that's a much bigger task then to educate peoole to reject any debt based form of exchange. Besides, when the collapse happens in that system, we will not be forced to bail out the debt holders and allow their debt to become legitimately money and inflate the economy through quantitative easing. This time we can simply say "no", and reject all the debt from the system.

Just bought it at an ATH. No regrets.
Tip for those who haven't bitten the bullet yet: think of it this way - every time the price rises, your existing bitcoins are going up in value. So consider the higher price to be offset by the gains you've already made.
I'm currently averaging a 118% return on my bitcoin investments. That's a lot less than a lot of people in here, but it's about 20X the returns you will get from any other investment. When you think of it that way, its a no brainer.

Your entire argument seems predicated on everyone being able to perfectly time their buys. If you have a crystal ball, then best of luck to you. But there are a lot more investors in bitcoin regretting selling at a couple of hundred dollars than there are regretting buying at a high price. So until that changes, you're kind of arguing against statistical probability and assuming people can play it like a casino and make bigger wins. For the vast, vast majority of people, that simply isn't the case.

I don't think we're in a bubble. I think people (investors as well as ordinary people) are finally catching on that the banking system is fucked and this is a relative safe haven.
I would be putting money into bitcoin even if it wasn't going up. Because here in the UK, interest rates are below inflation. I'm literally losing money having it sit in the bank. As more people look to escape that scenario, deflationary assets start to look pretty appetising. And this is the 21st century, who really is gonna buy gold and silver these days? We didn't have bitcoin during the last financial collapse in 2008 - this time people have the option of a good store of value as an insurance policy against the fucked up financial situation in many countries all over the world - and all you need is a smart phone.
I think everyone on this sub underestimates this a huge driving factor for current adoption. Right now it's some of the big investors getting their money out of fiat, but soon that will trickle down to the masses and we're gonna see some unbelievable rises in vale. And I can't see people taking their gains out too quickly. Why would you go from putting your money into a safe store value, seeing it multiply many times over, and then put it all back in the bank to lose value? I really think we're at the beginning of something big here.
The real question is how Segwit 2X is going to effect all this. Right now bitcoin needs to be a good store of value. That's what is needed right now for bitcoin. We need lower transaction fees of course, but we can't risk bitcoin as a deflationary store of value right now in favour of a good transactional currency. If we can avoid a chain split and keep bitcoin clear of technological infighting for the next year, I think it will exceed all expectations in valuation.

So essentially you're expecting everyone to perfectly time a dip, otherwise they have made a loss? So if it EVER goes down from an ATH then anyone who had bought at the ATH had made a mistake, regardless of whether it recovers in the long term?
The vast, vast majority of bitcoin investors have at some stage seen the price to drop below what they have paid at some point. That's why we dollar cost average.
You're asking a lot if you expecting everyone to either perfectly time a dip, or to have been in since the beginning. Most people fit in neither of these categories, but have still made substantial gains.
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:40:41
Ok, so we can agree that extremely small number of people who bought at the ATH before the slight dip of about $50, have not made money (assuming this was their first ever buy, and have never touched bitcoin before).
I'd say that's pretty good odds Vs the number of people who have made net gains benefiting from hodling.
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:02:58
Um.. no you were saying that bitcoin is an imaginary commodity. Your replies are seeming increasingly abstract.
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:51:38
I appreciate your thought out reply, however if lightning really is coming in 2018, then surely Litecoin's days are numbered.
Besides I don't actually see that much innovation happening on litecoin. Sure, they adopted Segwit first, but that was a technology developed for Bitcoin by core. They just implemented it first. And I don't think that faster block time counts as an innovation, just as a bigger block size doesn't.
Again I'm not trying to hate on Litecoin, I like Charlie and the fact they are friendly to bitcoin. But I don't even think it's proven to be useful for innovation. Monero, zcash and even Dash and Etherium are more interesting coins for innovation in my opinion. But hey, each to their own!

Can you lot genuinely not tell the difference between a forked coin and an altcoin, or is everyone just playing stupid around here?
Well in case there are any newbies in here (or people who genuinely want to learn) let me break this down very simply:
Bitcoin Cash is a forked coin. It is an "altcoin" insofar as it does not have the bitcoin ticker due to it being a minority chain, but it is not like other altcoins which have their own blockchain with no shared history of transactions, and crucially, their own "genesis block".
Here's a handy way of ascertaining if a coin is a forked coin or a completely independent altcoin: If you held Bitcoin prior to the inception of the "altcoin's" existence, world you now own that coin? If yes, it's a forked coin. If no, it's an altcoin.
Why is this important? Some upgrades to Bitcoin may require a change to the consensus rules which validate the blocks. So, for instance, even if everyone agreed on a change to consensus rules (i.e. an "uncontentious fork"), and a few nodes out of thousands continued running the original Bitcoin code, there would now be two bitcoins. However due to the overwhelming consensus, the forked coin would now be called Bitcoin. Theoretically, the few people who did not upgrade their nodes could argue that this is an "altcoin", and this could arguably be true, however the market would accept the new coin as bitcoin and therefore it's not really an altcoin, but the majority fork of bitcoin which we accept to be the true Bitcoin.
Calling bitcoin cash "bcash" does nothing but to make us sound petty, and just avoids the arguments in favour of name calling. I sold my bitcoin cash like everyone else, and have no interest in it on a technical basis, but can we please stop throwing out our critical thinking skills and actually state arguments rather than just trolling and distorting the truth?
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:22:46
Isn't this a bit of a problem? That if bitcoin goes over $1M, then it will be impossible to spend 1 cent, because a satoshi will be worth more than that? Or can smaller denominations be made possible by second layer technologies?
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:13:23
Thank you. I couldn't agree more. It's good to see from the reception of my comment that there are others out there who see things our way. But unfortunately we're be downed out by the trolls. I hope that changes soon.
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:49:46
I agree. I'm not claiming it does. But I've asked this question probably 10 times and I either get ignored or downvoted. I just want someone to explain to me how the network can defend itself from spam. No one has ever been able to just tell me what the solution is.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:33:59

@_date: 2017-11-02 19:28:11
We will see if that's true after the fork. My suspicion is that pre-fork opportunists are coming in.
I'll try to remember to bump this after the fork happens, since it seems the remind me bot isn't out to play.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:09:07
Bitcoin Cash is not an airdrop, it is a forked coin. An airdrop takes a snapshot of the blockchain and issues an altcoin based upon the balances.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:36:54
I think the value of pre-fork BTC will outweigh the value of post-fork BTC+B2X personally, so I still think selling pre-fork is a good idea, even though you won't get 2X coins.
In my opinion, 2X coins won't be valuable, but the hashpower shitstorm that 2X presents will do notable harm to BTC value.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:26:32
Can someone explain to me how you defend against"spamming the network"?
This seems like such a basic flaw in the system. How does bitcoin protect against this?
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:36:09
Just no. This is exactly the attitude that has led to everyone calling this sub "core trolls/shills". Because rather than explaining the technicalities of arguments (actually I've lost faith that more than about 5% of the participants of this sub have any idea what they are talking about on a technical basis but I digress) we just say "bcash is a shicoin" and refuse to discuss it further. Your comment about people's eyes glazing over is a case in point of this attitude: "[the plebs won't understand so let's just distort the truth for their tiny brains]"*.
And also no, Bitcoin Cash is not becoming known as "bcash" to the greater public. Come out of your circlejerk bubble and realise this. Then educate yourself about technicals and start using those arguments, because they are worth infinitely more to this debate than this silly namecalling.
* Paraphrasing for emphasis
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:24:32
I don't think BTC having a foothold is really too relevant here. Especially with a fork whereby all the prior development remains, and technical advancements can occur very quickly.
But I do happen to think that the core roadmap is superior to that of Bitcoin cash. So I will continue to support it. I just wish that more people around here believed in the core roadmap enough not to resort to pretty name calling and distortions over reasoned arguments.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:37:07
If spam is a legitimate attack on either bitcoin or bitcoin cash, are they not both fundamentally flawed?
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:05:28
None of the things that you mention are relevant. Case in point: If Segwit 2X had have happened (or any fork without full replay protection), then the infrastructure could be utilised by both chains.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:57:34
They still exist and are all actively being traded on exchanges. They weren't forked or airdropped from what I understand. Most of them are their own implementation of bitcoin core with a couple of tweaks, and I think one is an ERC-20 token.
My point being that no one seemed to care about all these altcoins using the name bitcoin until BCH forked off. Besides, a fork gives a coin far more of a claim to use the Bitcoin name than just copying the Bitcoin core code and starting a new crypto from its own genesis block.
So this is what annoys me. If one's argument is that Bitcoin Cash is a scam and is leeching the "real" Bitcoin's brand, then where has the outrage been for all these other coins that have been doing the exact same thing?
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying we **shouldn't** be outraged about these other coins, I'm just saying we must be consistent. Either they all need to be condemned, or we just let the whole name thing go and have a debate about the technicals. My worry is that by having this selective outrage about the name Bitcoin Cash, all we are doing is giving it a free ride on its technicals.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:17:11

If that's the case then you've just defeated your own argument.. because they would already be in.
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:41:50
That isn't a technical argument at all. People adopt coins for their use case, not because there's "no drama".
If LTC had the level of adoption of bitcoin, you'd have an equal amount of drama anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:49:07
They probably bought BTC with all that printed Tether. The price of that BTC has gone up massively. They sell some of that BTC to create their "Tether Reserve". And keep the rest. Then release the news about the Tether "hack". Once they're in the clear.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:42:29
It doesn't matter whether it happened. The point is that infrastructure compatibility does not define bitcoin. You do realise that there will be many changes to the core repository that will require wallets etc to upgrade? That doesn't suddenly make bitcoin core an altcoin.
Don't disagree at all with your second point.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:53:24
The big blockers don't generally want Segwit.
And they largely believe that small blocks are deliberately being forced by the core developers working for Blockstream so that they can sell side chains as a solution to network congestion.
Once you have Segwit, block size increases become less necessary anyway due to efficiency improvements and second layer solutions. And SW2X has essentially no development team.
So bitcoin cash is the on-chain scaling experiment of the big blockers.
And I wish them luck. Time will tell if the Blockstream conspiracy is true, and likewise if the big block centralisation/latency problem is true.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:55:26
Actually recently it is gaining value vs BTC. However I'm sceptical as to whether this will be sustained.
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:30:36
Thanks that makes sense I guess. So is spam a way of the miners pushing up the transaction fee artificially? And if so, why do they want bigger blocks? Surely smaller blocks means they can spam the network easier and cheaper? Or is the idea to be able to get more tx fees from the extra transactions in each block?
Just trying to understand the economic forces at play here.. I've never really understood why miners want bigger blocks since it brings down the transaction fee which they get.
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:16:12
Why though? I don't get why bitcoiners give Litecoin a free pass. Because Charlie Lee is pro core? The faster block time is basically no better than increased block size in terms of decentralisation.
IMO either bitcoin fails due to transaction fees, or bitcoin succeeds as a transactional currency due to lightning and second layers - in which case LTC is rendered redundant.
I like Charlie Lee as much as the next guy, but let's be honest, if bitcoin truly succeeds then Litecoin will go into the dustbin of crypto history with many and most other coins.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:21:45
I apologise if I mischaracterised you.
I too have introduced people to bitcoin, and recently I have been getting the question "what is bitcoin cash?"
Not once has someone said "what is bcash?" Every single exchange, price aggregator, crypto news source with a couple of exceptions such as Bitfinex list it as Bitcoin Cash. I also point people to Andreas Antonopolous' videos, who calls it Bitcoin Cash.
Can't we all see that censorship, misinformation and name calling are making us look bad? It looks totally desperate. Why do we need to call it a different name if it's such a shitcoin? Let's let it collapse under it's own technical flaws. And let's highlight those flaws. I honestly couldn't give a shit what they call it if their arguments fall down.
Let me ask you, are you on the same renaming vedetta against the following coins:
Bitcoin Gold
Bitcoin Dark
Bitcoin Plus
Bitcoin Red
Bitcoin Fast
I doubt that you are. Now, if you only pick out Bitcoin Cash as the one to launch a smear campaign against in terms of the name, don't you think that looks desperate and actually gives it more credibility than it deserves?
You don't see Etherium mounting a campaign against the 8 other coins with "Ether" in the name. Guess why? Because they don't give a shit about those coins. They don't have the best developers, best infrastructure, best community or best technology. Neither does Bitcoin Cash.
So frankly, I don't give a shit that they call it Bitcoin Cash, and I don't think y'all should either. Because it will never be Bitcoin, not because of the name, but in fact because of everything except the name.

I have a couple of technical questions:
Can anyone explain to me the following about mining?
1) Are miners free to choose whatever transactions they want to include in the block (both number of tx to include, and which ones?)
2) If they can choose, then why do we see empty blocks mined? Surely this is really unprofitable and against their own interests? And if not, then I still don't understand how or why this happens?
3) If they can choose, could this be an (attempted) way to combat criminal activity? I.e. the authorities could make it illegal for miners to include certain transactions known to be criminal? (Regardless of whether it would work in practice).

Thanks for this post. It's the first post to actually talk about the economics and vested interests of the system, and not just tout some rambling nonsense about Jihan Wu and Roger Ver and bcash FUD (etc).
I've been on the fence in the whole small block/big block debate for a while but this is one of the first posts that I actually understood and made sense.
Edit: Since you're a good explainer, are you able to address in laymen's terms the accusation that the lightning network will also lead to centralisation because of the centralising effects of lightning channels? Its a big ask, but it would be super useful!
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:24:54
Better. Yet sadly and obviously not true..
@_date: 2017-09-07 14:58:25
So why do so many small blockers tout Litecoin as being so great? Surely the 2.5 minute block time goes against their philosophy as its centralisation effect is essentially the same as a 4X block size increase?

@_date: 2017-10-24 16:01:13
But isn't spam about pushing up the fee price artificially by flooding the mempool with transactions? If it works then why won't it always work? How does the block reward make a difference to that?
@_date: 2018-02-23 19:19:43
Thanks, that makes a lot of sense. Although blocks are only 1mb, so it doesn't seem to me to be a particularly time costly thing for them to receive the transaction data. Surely this takes seconds? This seems an infintesimally small drawback in order to collect all the fees from the next block to me?
And in any case, could the protocol not prevent the mining of empty blocks by requiring at least one transaction to be included in each block? The network does not really benefit from mining empty blocks, and this would force miners to stop this practice?

Is there any defence against spam? Or will the mempool always be spammed causing problems at any stage of scale?
It sounds like when people put false bids on eBay to drive the item price up. Only this is fucking with people's money and could be extremely profitable for preparators. Not to mention they are competitive completely anonymous.
How does the network defend against this kind of attack? (Question goes out to anyone who understands this stuff).

First of all, gold is at about the same value it was 6 years ago, while every fiat currency has fallen in purchasing power in that time. So that is actually good advice comparative to not buying a commodity at all.

@_date: 2017-07-31 00:05:30
Correct. Your coins will be transferable on both chains after the split. But these chains will be completely independent of each other after the split.
So after the split, you can use the exact same private key to transfer your coins to a bitcoin cash supporting wallet and a bitcoin wallet, and you'll then have the bitcoins on both. But they will have completely different values and will be on eternally different chains from that point forward. Hope this helps.
@_date: 2017-07-30 23:53:39
You'll get 10 BTC on both chains. But not if your coins are on an exchange for which you don't hold the private keys (unless they support BCC now or in the future, which is unlikely).
I recommend getting them either on a paper wallet, or using a hot wallet which you have control over the keys. (Electrum is being touted as one I believe, but I think it's generally more common for desktop wallets... Perhaps someone can correct me on this though).
@_date: 2017-07-30 23:44:13
Any wallet that allows you to control your own private keys will allow you to transfer BCC. Because all you need are the keys. I think electrum does, for instance.
Personally I'd just take a few minutes to create a paper wallet and transfer on to that. That way you're sure. It's very easy to do, and an important learning experience if you're new to bitcoin.
As for selling it. I'm not sure what exchanges will be supporting it. Personally I wouldn't worry about that just yet. Just keep hold of it and if BCC ever gets any value, then I'm sure some exchanges will support it so then you can sell.
Right now the important thing is just to make sure it's in a wallet for which you control the keys. Because some wallets will never support it so the BCC won't be retrievable.
@_date: 2017-06-07 09:01:28
Is anyone ballsy enough to be buying right now? Or are most of you sitting on your existing stash?
Long time lurker here.. I bought some BTC when it was at about $1000, was investing gradually because of exchange limits, and intended to double or triple my investment at the time, then the price started to skyrocket and I keep expecting it to fall at some point, but that might be wishful thinking (thinking as a buyer here, not a holder).
I'm finding myself glued to the price index and every week I'm saying to myself "you should have bought last week". Is this a bubble or not guys? I'm going insane!
@_date: 2017-06-07 09:37:50
I feel your conundrum. I ultimately want to buy more, but it feels so painful buying like 0.17 BTC for $500 when I was buying half a bitcoin for that only a few months ago. It's a strange situation wanting my investment to drastically fall in value (albeit temporarily) but I guess that's just the nature of arriving late to the crypto party...
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:34:19
This is true.. I should adopt this way of thinking for sure, it's just whether to invest now or to expect a price correction in the short term. We're very outside the mean price right now, but you know what? You guys have convinced me, I'm going in again starting tomorrow!
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:16:32
I'm capped at £500 on coinbase. Guess I'll have to look into increasing that. I thought it was their max but I guess not.
@_date: 2017-06-07 10:14:17
True. I had thought about keeping my investment at 130%. So essentially continuing to invest my "earnings" back in so that my BTC value is always hovering around 130% of my GBP investment in the currency. Which would be far better than anything you'd get from the stock market, but the volatility of crypto is keeping me for applying that same logic..
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:08:44
So you're still buying at the current price? Mind of I ask how long you're been involved/investing in bitcoin? I get the impression that a lot of the long timers are not buying at the moment, but I'm not sure whether that's because they have already put in a good investment early on, or if they see a crash coming.
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:24:18
Yeah I looked at BitPanda but I don't like that I have to load in Euros because I'll get charged by my bank. I did get verified on another couple of exchanges but the exchange rate sucked. Then again considering the price fluctuations recently it is actually rather negligible in comparison.
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:57:15
Thanks for sharing. Sounds like a really good way to put money into bitcoin. Gradually, without much effort or need to watch the price. That would certainly be a good solution for me to stop myself being glued to the price index but hey.
I think I will start to apply the same logic though of not trying to be tactical with it. Just be happy to have average gains of +x%. Currently that figure is around 200% for me, so I think I'll keep investing and stop worrying about all this bubble business. The price has already risen about £800 whilst I've been waiting on the price to fall, and I truly believe the value will be twice what it is now by the end of the year, so I think I ought to stop obsessing, trust my intuition and put some more money in. If it crashes in the short term, it crashes.
@_date: 2017-06-07 10:15:47
I think I'm gonna bite the bullet and do the same. Good to know there are others confident enough to buy and hold right now!
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:00:45
Yeah, i did buy a few ETH as well and I've had good returns, and more recently some LTC to hopefully benefit from a late surge from FOMO crypto investors, but to be honest I don't truly believe in the long term value of either of those cryptocurrencies. I think BTC is the only 100Xer personally!
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:15:07
I guess everyone has a different perspective depending on when they bought. For instance ETH has been a good investment for me, even though I bought it at £50. It's not that I don't think BTC value will go up to many times it's current value, it's just that I think I could potentially save myself £1000 or so if there's a short term crash, but every day I'm becoming less convinced that is gonna happen.
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:08:24
Did you do this through localbitcoins or something similar? I'm running into caps from the main exchanges which is why I didn't initially invest the full £5k I had set aside to put into BTC..
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:06:46
Probably not. I think the chances of bitcoin being able to overcome every possible existential threat it will face is small, but I certainly think it's value will climb a lot higher than it is now, and maybe even stay extremely high as a store of value, while another crypto, or cryptos, reign supreme for daily transactions.
My main concern is whether its value will crash to some degree in the short term. I think right now it's looking like it will either go exponential, or we will see a crash. But I'm not sure where I fall on that one..
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:06:31


Could you explain what you mean by this?
Also I'm interested to know how you go about getting your travel expenses reimbursed in BTC. Do you work in the tech industry to be able to do this? I'd get paid in BTC if I could, but all I'd get would be black looks by my clients!
