I've used bitstamp several times, but are they trusted simply cause they're the only ones that hasn't dun goof'd so far? or is there something other that they provide which makes them more trustworthy?

You dont need to agree with destiny to see that Jordan is a maniac.
@_date: 2018-12-27 23:08:23
The guy defends something Jordan says in a video, they even look through the video and argues about everything being said in that video. not everyone have the fortune to go 1-1 with him.
Ok, lets try something else, I assume that you're someone that doesnt want to blindly want to follow something without doing some fact-checking (being on bitcoin subreddit after all). What sources have you looked at that attacks Jordan Petersons views and what are your counter-points regarding those attacks? 
I ask this even though i expect to get some super extreme sources that neither of us agrees with.
EDIT: downvotes and ignores, classic
