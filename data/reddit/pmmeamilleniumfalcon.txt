The difference is that in 2000, people were investing in actual companies. It's hard to tell though if we're in 1994 or 1999

Yeh, I can withdraw money from anywhere on the planet with a single card. The bastards!
@_date: 2018-05-18 20:31:51
See, you say that, but what about the regular people who have $30,000 in savings in a regular Chase bank? What happens to them? Do they just lose everything because "le rekt lol bitcoin to teh moon!"

By 1968, visa's 10 year mark, credit cards has a 10.2% adoption rate. 
10 years into bitcoin, you're at .00081%
It's both funny and sad how passionately nerds defend a payment system that has zero chance of succeeding. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:06:40
Lol, yeh, cos there's NO way you can ever lose or damage your phone. 
Get back to me when bitcoin handles more than .00081% of daily worldwide transactions.

Lol classic failure talk. "It's the media's fault! It's the banks fault! It's the establishment's fault!"
Ever think "it's a shitty product that no one wants to use"?

Why are you anti-inflation out of interest? If you don't have inflation, then there's zero incentive to put money into assets - why spend any of your bitcoins if you know they'll be worth more tomorrow? The economy would ground to a halt without inflation.

I'm heartbroken :) 
@_date: 2018-05-02 13:49:55
Yeh. Cos when I land in a foreign country and my phone is dead, I'll be SO happy for the 'convenience' of charging my phone, looking for wifi, updating the app, just to pay for a pack of gum.

Who the fuck stands in line to deposit? All paychecks are done electronically. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 13:51:03


What a load of crap. What bank charges you $30 for making a transaction, you're clearly lieing to further your agenda. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:54:52
What fucking privilege. Even if you work at goddman McDonalds you're paid electronically
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:52:43


You're really not though. As more and more stores REJECT bitcoin, more and more stores won't bother jumping on board in the first place. And the companies who already rejected are going to stay away - they're not going to think "well it was awful last time, but maybe THIS time it'll be good"

In pog form!

ELI5: (and I literally know nothing, please forgive my ignorance). Currently when I buy something online on, say, Amazon, the CC info is already stored, I have one click turned on, so why is lightning better for me as a consumer? It seems there's no real difference in the paying experience, so why would I bother switching? People are, fundamentally, lazy and look for the path of least resistance, and the only way you have them change their habit is to have a product that dramatically improves the experience. Why is this "the future"?

Except, it does. In Australia, you have a conservative party that supports universal healthcare, welfare, infrastructure spending, etc. And if they ever DO try to attack those institutions their poll numbers plummet (see the 2014 budget).  
@_date: 2018-04-23 17:34:32
Difference is in Australia we have compulsory voting, so the public by default can't get complement enough to stay home. It's not perfect, but it prevents the parties from catering to the 20% of people on the far left and right, and forces them to the center. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:28:44


So what's better, just cater towards the morons on the extreme left and right? 


Yeh, how dare they do what the voters want!
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:29:29
I’d completely disagree, because US dollars do have inherent value for one simple reason - they’re what you’re legally required to pay taxes with. If you don’t, the worlds largest, most powerful government is allowed to use force to get you to pay, and if you don’t you get sent to jail. 
You’re right in that “nothing has intrinsic value apart from food heat and shelter”, but you’re incorrect in saying that USDs don’t have value because if you don’t use them, everything in your life that DOES has intrinsic value can be taken away, so by association USDs have the same value.

But by being forced to take part, it forces politicians to actually care about the 60% of the country in the center who are just regular working people, instead of ignoring them like they do now. 
You're forced to pay taxes. You're forced to fight in wars. You're forced to spend the first 16 years of your life in school. It's hardly a huge infringement of 'freedom' to be force to show up for an hour every 4 years to participate in electing who'll lead your country. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 20:40:36
No. You're FORCED to show up, but you can draw a penis on the ballot paper if you want. There's also dozens of independent parties to choose from - anything from the Australian motoring enthusiasts party, the Australian sex party, or the Australian sports party. 
But I wouldn't expect your education system to give you the critical thinking skills to do two seconds of research. Guess that's what happens when you've got the 'freedom' to let your country get hollowed out. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 13:20:13
So you're happy to be forced to go fight and die for a country, but not happy to spend an hour writing on a piece of paper once every 4 years?
