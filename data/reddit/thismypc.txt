Dang, even I forgot about those.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:03:47


Is it ln + . or just ln  ?
If this works I’m gonna go celebrate today.
Edit: just tried Ln and Ln. but no luck :(
Edit2: on limits I’m good for up to 10k on usd wallet and bank account, 750 for credit/debit.
I’ll try using the link on the limits page tomorrow, thanks!

I’m sorry about that man. On the bright side, odds are if you had access to your btc a while ago you would’ve probably sold it before the fork, but i know that won’t make it feel much better.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:55:15
lol well I’ve been getting my error for a few months now. I’m pretty sure mine is caused by never being employed/too young. Hope it works out for you though!
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:42:24
Tried this too and it didn’t work for me :( probably because of the occupation section (unemployed student who has never worked)
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:25:10


This is what I got when trying to verify my identity on Coinbase (it's at least 95% accurate, page refreshes 2 seconds after spitting the error out). It's really aggravating especially since they already have my ID on record to let me buy coins.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:19:51
Also OP since you had your bitcoin before the fork, you also have an equivalent amount in bch. Bch is worth around 1/10 of a bitcoin rn. Search around and figure out how to sell that.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:15:21
I really with my account would pass the gdax verification but noooooo my info doesn’t match “public records”.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:27:10
Lmao �� 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:34:01
Ah well I’ve never opened a credit account, could that possibly be it?
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:33:50
Nope neither. That actually explains a lot.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:08:47
I believe it was just last month, but i could be wrong though. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:19:37
I think once you get a job or a certain age your name is put into whatever system they check against. I have no idea though, just a guess.
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:40:02
What do you mean create a second seed?
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:44:41
Man I wish I could forget about $700 I've spent.
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:33:57
Hm if reddit was a language, Reddlish would probably be the name.
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:52:11
i do
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:48:45
The same place you are today 
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:46:03
Hodl. But what exchange was that? Highest I saw was 4400.
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:31:07
You soiled your own plan.
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:21:05
Spoiler alert! The episode is pretty new haha.
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:39:27
GUYS I WAS GONE FOR A DAY. WTH HAPPENED.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:14:47
You guys put way too much faith into random internet strangers lol.
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:08:08
"We could not confirm this identity based on public records. Please double check your information or try a different address."
This is after attempting to register as an individual and attempting to select Unemployed + Student as occupations (I've never been employed).
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:54:45
you just reminded me to invest in memes
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:29:49


Not OP, but i've been trying to get verified on GDAX as a student for months and it simply won't let accept my info. Absolutely infuriating, especially when people remind me how good it is.
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:51:47
I like this
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:53:00
It feels like it was just yesterday for me. I left bitcoin after following it for a long time. Then my sister messaged me saying it was about to hit 2k. I was amazed at what it had become over the years.
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:31:48
Nah. Crash imminent
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:53:52
With some luck, I ended up getting verified by Coinbase. Bought a bit of btc, but I feel like I bought at the wrong time. I have a feeling the next week isn't going to go so well. Just speculation though.
@_date: 2017-05-28 04:15:52
Dang dude, as I saw the price crashing all I could think about was this post.
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:27:10
Where do you consider the best place to check current BTC price?
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:52:02
sucks that it was a bank transfer, gotta wait a few days. it'll probably be too late by then.
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:11:43
I thought that's what they fixed.
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:49:00
I haven't bought any yet because I waited too long for prices to go down. I realized a few days ago that it's not stopping, but everywhere requires verification to purchase with a card .-. 
Still in the process of getting verified, crying while I watch the price goes up.
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:36:05
I'll hold you to this :) Hopefully I'll be verified by at least one exchange by then.
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:29:10


I keep seeing this, but I don't understand what the problem is with keeping them on electrum.
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:46:04


and if we don't?
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:27:51
where should i sell if I can't sell on coinbase?
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:20:17
What are you referring to?
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:10:41
You don't sell, you hodl.
@_date: 2017-06-02 02:28:58
I thought he meant 85 for 8 bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:35:10
How long would you be willing to wait to sell them?
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:57:07
Hey, what website do you use to get a full list?
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:56:01
Oh damn, that's amazing.
@_date: 2017-06-17 02:28:34
He actually a pretty all right guy.
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:42:47
When you do recover it, let us know what you found!
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:26:53
Woah, that's actually a decent size for only mining alts and trading. Nice man, any tips?
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:34:01
This looks like it might be it OP
@_date: 2017-06-20 21:17:18
When was the last time ETH left that ~350 range? Sorry, I don't follow it much.
