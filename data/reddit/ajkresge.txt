I doubt it will ever get that high, but if it does $10.5 trillion/21 million bitcoins comes out to $500,000.

While I agree that a bitcoin central bank is completely against what bitcoin stands for, I think the idea of being able to opt for a full reserve or fractional reserve account at a bitcoin exchange is pretty good. Users could choose to put their coins to work and get some interest in return or just keep them in storage without interest. It could possibly help bitcoins liquidity problem too. This might be irrelevant though if places like btcjam and other ways to loan money become more prevalent.

Bitcoin or other digital currencies could be huge in developing countries and help them out a lot, I think Bill Gates even mentioned this in his AMA not that long ago.

That's a good point. If bitcoin ever became as big as the dollar then each coin could be worth well over $100K.

Not sure why you're being downvoted. Nobody's entirely sure what is going on (there are a lot of theories) because Gox is being really shady about it and not giving legit answers.

I wonder if the feds will go after the bitcoin exchanges that are helping these dispensaries.

I'm no bitcoin expert but from what I've read they coded their site poorly and might not have created a way to deal with the transaction malleability bug. They blame bitcoin when its really a problem with their site. They are claiming the bug has caused all of their problems but all the other exchanges have found a way around it with hardly any trouble. They refuse to tell anyone what has actually happened and will not even say if they still have everyones coins. It's possible they're not solvent but who knows.
