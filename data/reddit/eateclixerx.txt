Read again. I'm pointing out a security flaw in **BIP148/149** (not BIP141 SegWit) that many other people noticed early on, but apparently not you. 
You owe your bitcoins (if any) to SegWit2x (lol) for saving you from your own stupidity.

"we're going to suck up to Core because that sells better"..... shuffles away....... "quick, remove the code that prevents a chain split and put *their* name on it because this will fool the suckers into buying our UASF shitcoin."

I wish they had started using SegWit by minority-forking off with BIP148/149, anyone would be able to steal any of their **Bit**coins.
(who even cares about the shitcoins, whether UAHF coins or minority UASF coins, when you can steal the main chain Bitcoins)

SegWit2x (1/2) can activate after BIP148 has activated.

I know it doesn't make sense to *you*, "redditor for 4 years". After all, you [bought the UASF shitcoin](


Wake the fuck up and get a clue. All the information is out there.

I thought BCC stands for [Blind Carbon Copy]( (of previous hard forks, in this case).

That would be this guy who happens to be responsible for BIP148:
