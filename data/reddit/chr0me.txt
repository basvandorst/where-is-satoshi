Hmm... Which of the dozen or so IP routing protocols have you evaluated and found to be unsuitable, and why?

What service are you using for ACH transfers?

As someone who's extensively used MTurk, this service won't be able to compete until everything can be controlled via an API.  Cool potential nonetheless though.

Pinging 8.8.8.8 as a latency test is rather pointless.  Your packets are routed to Google's nearest DNS server automatically. That IP doesn't lead to a single destination.

I've had a (more complex) version of this idea in the back of my head for about three years.  Using Bitcoin solves a lot of the problems with the implementation that I was wrestling with.  Very cool to see someone do something like this.  Good luck!

Crowdflower uses MTurk.  Seems like a pretty redundant solution for your use case.

How much have you spent on hardware and power?  How much have you made as a result?

How quickly do you generate coins?  I downloaded the Windows client last week and have it set to generate, but haven't gotten anything yet.  I read earlier that this practically useless nowadays anyhow.  I'm just curious how quickly they come in with the proper mining setup?
