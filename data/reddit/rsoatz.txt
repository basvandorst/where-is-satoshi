ABOVE ATH COMING NOW  
I CAN FEEL IT IN MY GUT I SWEAR

What I know about the internet is it always does the opposite.
FOMO into BTC asap.
@_date: 2019-07-12 10:37:50
Yeah, everyone and their boomer parent will see the talk about BTC.
It's all uphill from here anyway.
@_date: 2019-07-12 13:02:26
Stock markets like stability. Crypto is volatile and unpredictable.

BTC should be mooning right now after the Fed said it has store value. Many other cryptos wish they had the fed say that about their coin.

What the hell is wrong with Coinbase?
Transaction link says "No transactions detected"
I paid the highest fee too!
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:08:51
It's going to have the opposite effect.

"Sell from" doesn't have USD wallet for me :(
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:30:59
Sweet! Great to know. This is what I will be doing.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:56:21
Thank you!

Also one more question. I've gotten a "warning" from coinbase once because I used a betting site (Bovada) directly with Coinbase (They said you have to transfer to a wallet then use from that wallet) and have not done anything like that ever after. Will they ever have a reason to ding me or freeze my account?
I heard bad things about their customer support.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:56:11
Are they as reliable as Coinbase?
I guess that depends on how "reliable" Coinbase is...they are FDIC insured for the USD wallet

Thanks! Yeah I transferred back to Coinbase to cash out from a web based wallet (I ordered a hardware wallet so hasnt come in yet).
I just wanted to make sure I'm safe.
Also how do I make an internal transaction to credit?
I just want to turn BTC to USD for now. My bank account is already connected to Coinbase.
PS those purchase &amp; transfer limits on Coinbase suck.
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:31:23
What about quick sells like cashing out to USD?
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:45:19
I want to right now, but afraid if I set a transaction now (you know &gt;to bank&lt; transactions take a few business days)
I should be ok right?
It's a larger amount and I don't want to deal with Coinbase customer support.
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:19:48
CEX or Bitstamp? Or Bitfinex?
I live in USA so which one's better in general?
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:30:46
Awesome thanks! I've been small timing most of the time so wasn't 100% sure how this worked.
Waiting for my Trezo (new one that comes out in January) so I store remaining BTC in a safe place!
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:59:46
BTW can I transfer BTC to USD (Wallet) on Bitcoin?
Is it safe there?
Then go from USD (Wallet) to Bank? Or to buy more bitcoin in the future? I know its not safe to store in coinbase.
