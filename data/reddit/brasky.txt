Collapse of the US dollar.

I dont know what will happen. But I guess you could look at what happened with past global reserve currencies when they lost their dominate status.

You can always transfer the coins manually  yourself at anytime. Read the instructions at coinbase.

I lost all my coins in a tragic boating accident.

You use a reputation system just like on something like silkroad but this time decentralized.

maybe you should lighten up a little

My node uses about 12GB a day. I have 108 connections right now. Running on comcast for the last year or so. So far they have not said anything about all the bandwidth which I know goes near 500GB some months. Comcast should be rolling out fiber here this year hopefully that dont have crazy data caps on that.
@_date: 2015-06-19 01:49:24
The price will probably go up to 1k by then. I think colored coins will really catch on people we only be using colored satoshis for most things. That is why the price does not have any real reason to get super high.
@_date: 2015-06-04 21:52:00
Pretty much. That is all you need. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 12:28:41
Yep. I wonder which government will be the first to issue a token on the blockchain? If most people are using tokens which I think they will be the overall price of bitcoin does not need to be high. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 03:08:32
I thought we were still waiting on greece.
@_date: 2015-06-16 01:54:48
Sounds like a good plan.

It connects to special electrum servers not regular bitcoin nodes.
@_date: 2015-06-19 01:43:09
So what is pulling the ratchet? I like to call it anarchism some just call it freedom or maybe just plain old evolution.
@_date: 2015-06-27 00:37:11

The info on that page about restoring your wallet in multibit is no longer possible. This has been pointed out before yet you still do nothing. One of the most incompetent bitcoin companies.

I will tell you to go fuck yourself because I am an anarchist. My morals override yours. That is a fact. You cling to governments and I dont. I dont require violent force for my ideas to prosper, you do. Bitcoin is anarchism. I understand that this is very hard for most people to comprehend but it is a fact. Bitcoin is a working example of anarchism.
The feat bitcoin has achieved is one of the biggest if not the biggest achievements of anarchism. Look, I get it anarchism is not a known concept to the vast majority of human beings. I totally get it. But bitcoin is an anarchist system whether you like it or not. I dont deny that governments can impact bitcoins survival I am just pointing out that satoshi was not of fan of the US gov. The genesis block references the US bank bailouts. I mean how much more proof do you need?
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:39:04
Not very much disk space 
@_date: 2014-01-09 02:31:15
I love a good conspiracy and this one has entertained me recently. It is plausible but I dont think it is true. It would be much easier to create a new fiat currency and create the north american union. If you follow conspiracies you are probably already aware of the plans to unite mexico, usa and canada. That would be much easier and would only need the usual tricks the elite are used to. A crypto currency is just too far out of their league I think. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 03:48:16
We didnt. You care about governments and what they think. I dont care if the government makes playing bingo is illegal tomorrow. You do. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 15:49:08
Yeah they are probably waiting for PayPal to buy them
@_date: 2014-02-01 02:52:05
Oh I know anarchist dont run the world. Those words dont even work together. Anarchists DONT want to run the world. That is sort that whole point of anarchism....

I think this guy is about 10 or 20 years off his predictions. Robot AI surgeons in 10 years? Uh yeah okay

They already do that now. AI isnt going to do it anytime soon.
@_date: 2014-01-05 15:20:46
Don't use the mobile apps. If you really need to make a new wallet and only keep a small amount in it. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 04:37:10
He basically said that the US gov was broke. Both parties were pro bailout. The system is broke, obviously. Satoshi was merely pointing out how broken it was and incredibly he/she provided a system that works without them. Like I said an incredible feat of anarchy that has never been seen. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 01:19:33
haha yeah. Anarchism is a very simple moral standing. You cant be sorta anarchist. Either you believe in the non initiation of force or you dont. Anarchism is really one of the most simple concepts there is. People make it out to be this complex idea but it is the most basic idea there is.

@_date: 2014-02-01 01:22:25
Oh look another person who just likes bitcoin for its value and not the moral reason is was created for in the first place. Get the fuck off this subreddit. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 01:55:48
You obviously dont care about the moral reasons as to why satoshi created bitcoin. All you seem to care about is value and if the US gov likes it or not. You realise bitcoin was created directly as a result of the US govs abuse of its power? You get that right? Bitcoin was created to be completely separate from governments. If you dont understand the underlying principles of decentralization then you are missing the whole fucking point of bitcoin. Take your 2 year old reddit account and your sudden bitcoin interest and go fuck yourself.
@_date: 2014-02-01 03:54:45
I am being narrow minded in your viewpoint yes. I understand that. I already told you, bitcoin is anarchy. Look up the definition. That is what we are arguing here. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 15:13:28
First heard about it in 2010 on slashdot I think. Then forgot about it until 2011. Been addicted since and I think bitcoin is a great example of anarchy in practice. 
@_date: 2014-02-05 02:05:06
mtgox is not going to destroy the market. a lot of people said the same thing when they got hacked. the end is here! uhm no. oh look 3 month old reddit account. GIANT yawn. come on people. i am sick of all these noobs.
@_date: 2014-02-01 02:59:56
If you want to get into a logic debate go ahead. Explain to me how violence is preferable to non violence. I am all ears. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 02:28:17
Governments are so corrupt that technically by definition it is anarchy. Like you said no system man builds is perfect. I think this is lost on most people. 
@_date: 2014-11-27 17:38:08
By default that app tries to "retrieve more info about the barcode". You have to uncheck in the settings. It is probably sending that data somewhere...
@_date: 2014-02-01 03:16:20
Okay man really read some philosophy. Philosophy and bitcoin go together really well. If you want to have a complete view on a topic you need to know every possible angle.  
@_date: 2014-02-01 01:15:15
It doesnt matter. Bitcoin is one step in the slow but inevitable process of human evolution towards anarchism. Bitcoin and decentralized currency has already proven itself. We took a giant step forward no matter the outcome. Most people here are so focused on bitcoin itself and not the tech and ideas behind it. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 03:52:42
Yes or no question, did you vote for people who were pro bailout? You are trying to avoid the facts here. Satoshi made a point in the genesis block, something many newbies dont know, that bitcoin was basically a response to governments and their control over finances. If you are going to spout off on how important government is to bitcoin you are seriously deluded. Bitcoin is anti government.

Once we are evolved enough the idea that that aggression would somehow be beneficial would be mostly unheard of. You can think of it like the scientific method. Not everyone accepts it yet but it is clearly the way to go and is gaining acceptance among humans and anyone wanting to be taken seriously adopts it. Anarchy will be basically the same thing. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 05:13:12
"the gov" still thinks people should be locked up in cages for using a plant that grows all over the planet naturally. So yeah I have no interest what "they" have to say about bitcoin. Anyone that does is a fucking moron.
@_date: 2014-02-01 04:26:01
So satoshi being anti bailout of the banks was not an opinion?
@_date: 2014-03-15 01:18:13
Very good info.
@_date: 2014-02-01 03:12:57
I am 30 years old. I once voted libertarian like many of this sub. I always had that underlying idea that maybe the system could change. It cant. It is flawed on an a very basic moral level. It didnt take long for me understand this. Like I said my views are extremely fringe. But like I said bitcoin is based on these views. I dont see anyone here saying satoshi and his message in the genesis block were wrong. A lot of you even voted for the people responsible for that. So take a look in the mirror.
Satoshi was an anarchist. Get over it. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 21:32:21
so edgey
@_date: 2014-01-19 18:13:28
cool story. i am in chico still waiting for a company here to accept it so i can be the first one to pay with it.
@_date: 2014-02-01 01:10:16
Dont know why you are getting down voted. I liked it when mostly anarchists cared about bitcoin. Now we got a sub full of government boot lickers who cant wait for the next word from the government on bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 00:12:45
Sadly most humans have yet to realize they are imprisoning themselves with governments. It is changing though and we will evolve past governments, bitcoin is proof.
@_date: 2014-02-07 01:56:30
the cfr only talked to him because they know he is satoshi and they wanted to meet their enemy
@_date: 2014-01-19 18:47:42
faking numbers is not illegal. your laws dont apply to bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-27 16:54:14
You also have to trust the app scanning the 2fa barcode. I think google auth uses a 3rd party camera app. I have always seen this as a major weak point.
@_date: 2015-05-27 19:15:30
The latency from the SD card and only 1GB of ram is a bigger problem. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 04:17:46
Being 99% sure you are secure is not that hard. Yeah it seems hard to the average person and I will admit that is something most people will find daunting. That is the reality of 2014 computing. I expect that to change over the years. The change is already apparent. Bitcoin is already providing a reason for people to be secure in their digital life. 
With the snowden leaks more people are entering into this atmosphere of security. It really is impeccable timing. You have the most revolutionary idea in many of our lifetimes (bitcoin) living in a digital world and you have a high level leaker saying trust no one but yourself. It really is a perfect combination. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 00:40:56
Starting to sound like the app is backdoored.
@_date: 2014-02-01 04:51:20
Well atleast we agree on something...  Really major props for agreeing the system is fucked. Now you bring up the the US gov not going anywhere. Now that is something I could absolutely debate. The US gov is a very young government. And if you dont know, and this is an absolute fact, every government fails eventually. Every single one. There is no room for discussion here. They have all failed. Every. Single. One.
Okay so if you are willing to research history and you realized that every government fails eventually then you must have the same ideas satoshi had. How do you create something that doesnt involve governments? Well satoshi did that. That is what bitcoin is. Remove government from the equation. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:45:47
@_date: 2014-02-01 03:37:53
Moral philosophy is an incredibly narrow philosophy. You either think violence is okay to get what you want or you dont. I dont think it is okay. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 11:58:52
I think augur is built on it. That is one of the most killer app looking things I have seen in years. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 00:26:07
A decentralized amazon quality store is at least a decade away probably.
@_date: 2015-05-29 00:23:24
I am sure something like augur could run on bitcoin and that is what I hope for. I am not into ethereum myself. I didnt think I was trying to sound like a visionary. I hardly even post and when I do it isnt any of the stuff you listed. The thing I notice a lot around here lately is accounts that are only months or even days old trashing everything.
@_date: 2015-05-29 12:50:24
No wonder they don't have HD wallets yet they can't even fix their old wallet. I wonder what they spent all their VC money on.

Same thing could have been said about email
@_date: 2015-05-28 21:15:27
Whatever you say. I don't think people realise the potential yet. It interests me and I have been following bitcoin for the last 5 years. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 14:31:53
Yeah we need more nodes. Something I haven't seen anyone bring up is also how almost 8% of the nodes are on comcast network and they are going to be implementing data caps soon. This might kill off a decent chunk of the network if people have to shutdown their nodes to save bandwidth. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 02:03:59
Too bad he isnt paying his loan on btcjam. He is late and not being very cooperative. 
Pay your debts Morgan. 
@_date: 2014-03-15 00:55:40
What will make bitcoin is people realizing the advantage of decentralized systems. There are lots of other things to like about bitcoin but ultimately I think people have to understand why it was created it the first place for them to embrace it not just as a currency but a philosophy. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 14:47:04
That project is not very active I have followed it for years. That is why something like this is going to take longer than 2 years to do. That is just the facts based on how many people are truly interested. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 02:04:20
Morgan has outstanding debt on btcjam and is not paying it.
I would not do business with this guy.
@_date: 2015-01-18 16:06:24
I would suggest switching to google authenticator so you wont have to worry about it in the future.

Bandwidth is actually getting worse. Most isps have data caps. 8% of the nodes are on comcast and they are going to start implementing data caps. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 08:20:47
Totally agree. Been here 5 years and the site is not really improving at all and I was really looking forward to bitcoin being integrated. Oh well someone will make the next reddit.

Anarchy isnt something that just happens. It is directly tied to human evolution. That is something I think everyone forgets but our forms of government or lack of are directly tied to evolution. Evolution is a very slow process. Think of anarchy like the scientific method because that is what it is. It is the same damn thing and you can see not even the scientific method is accepted worldwide yet. So obviously anarchy is a ways off but because of technology and bitcoin specifically anarchy is now closer than ever.

Anarchism is where all of this ends. The types of governments we form are directly tied to human evolution and it seems to be obviously heading that way.

I agree there will have to be some incentive. I am only doing this because I love bitcoin and have watched it grow from the beginning.

Are you on comcast? Once comcast starts charging people when they go over 250 or 300GB whatever it is a lot of nodes will go down. I have been running a node on comcast for over a month now and it is using at least 300GB a month. I am waiting for comcast to say something and then I will have to start limiting the bandwidth.

Now you are making people think. People dont like it when that happens!

They have had over 2 years to shut it down and they have gotten nowhere.
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:57:02
Sounds like a typical Bitcoin scam.

Voting is an act of violence. You are essentially saying that you approve of violent enforcement of your opinion whether it turns out to be popular or not. It is enforced with violence either way. Bitcoin is anarchy. It is a free market you can participate in or not. There is no threat of violence.

They only released part of it. Wikileaks only releases a fraction of what they have. Screw them. Julian would rather post more "insurance" files than actually release documents.

valve + steam + steambox + bitcoin. it mean it just makes sense.

No you can see for yourself

You cant really hate something that is free. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:43:30
nice try coinbase

Statism is pretty easy to destroy in a debate. Well if you have a working brain that is.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:24:29
Why don't you switch to a new provider who can actually stop a ddos? Do you get a refund when their service is clearly not working? 
@_date: 2013-09-15 04:27:10
It seems everyone who has had coins stolen is running windows. Does anyone know of a theft when someone was running linux?
@_date: 2013-09-16 02:16:26
Crunch the numbers. People who run windows get what they deserve. Is the NSA backdooring your OS not enough to make you wake up?
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:10:53
I wouldnt say it sucks. Every single forum software out has been hacked numerous times.
@_date: 2013-09-22 01:35:41
Bitcoin is quite clearly based on anarchist principles. If you fail to see this you are a moron. Every single thing about bitcoin is against what statism props itself up with. If you are just in it for the money or looking at it as some sort of investment than you have lost the whole point of bitcoin. I first read about bitcoin shortly after it was created when it was worth pennies and I cared not about the value but of its potential to disrupt the immoral structure of statism. It has worked wonderfully so far and you have to respect every aspect of it.

I think he is talking about the price of asic miners not the btc price.
@_date: 2013-09-15 21:37:58
They are 4.20 btc with free shipping in the US from BTC Guild

Glass Vapor Genie - 
Aromatherapy Candles - 
E-Cig - 
About $300 total
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:28:09
Yeah it seems the same thing happened to me. It always paid the normal fee before but for some reason it decided to send no fee this time. Very annoying.
@_date: 2013-08-20 02:00:14
Have they hired an armed guard at their warehouse yet?
@_date: 2013-10-04 06:54:06
People still reuse passwords on multiple sites? Anyone who still does that is a moron and deserves what they get.

California is a known leader in insane and downright absurd/made up laws.

bring it
@_date: 2013-02-26 00:54:55
An attack on bitcoin is almost something I hope happens. It will show how clearly corrupt and illegitimate the government really is. If they want a war they can have it.
@_date: 2013-03-21 00:57:14

bitcoin dont give a fuck
@_date: 2013-10-10 00:22:13
Ah hopefully. The old extension didnt have those permissions. Would be nice if they explained why they needed them.
@_date: 2013-05-04 01:57:35
Easy to remove if you want. I always wondered how anyone could complain about free stuff.

"3. Bitcoin and all crypto currencies set to absolutely CRASH as a result since the feds can not completely control this currency as they please."
lol yeah okay
@_date: 2013-10-16 07:36:47
Bitcoin is a functioning example of anarchy. It is priceless. It is a glimpse into mankinds future as we evolve past violence and statism.
@_date: 2013-05-04 00:59:50
Why not Ubuntu One? They would probably be into this more. 
@_date: 2013-08-13 22:26:21
oh no not the evil anarchism! think of the children.

My blockchain wallet is pretty old like over a year now. Havent had any issues. How are people getting wallet identifiers? I use the chrome app on linux and also the android app.
@_date: 2013-10-16 08:06:42
Well no fucking duh. That is why I called it a glimpse.
