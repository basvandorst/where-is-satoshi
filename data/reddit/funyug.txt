Bought a vps from ssdnodes.com last month. Havent faced any problem yet. They accept bitcoin too. Also did a bit of research on them before buying the vps. Didnt find any bad review.

only 6% of black money is in cash. This was done only to revive the banking sector which is in huge loss. They wrote off loans of 8lakh crore 3 days after the demonetization.

People cannot exchange bigger notes to smaller notes due to long lines of people trying to exchange their notes. However, you are correct bitcoin is almost unusable in India. It is just an investment option that people are going for as some people dont want to invest in gold.

Satoshi disappeared in 2010. People who were working with satoshi continued working on it. No takeover.

Yes they will have lower fees but only to an extent. Even if mempool is empty, people pay around 10 sat/byte just to be ahead of spam transactions. 10 sat/byte fee results in a fee of 16 cents which will only increase with the increase of price of bitcoin. Read the article to understand what I am trying to tell here.

They are not showing all blocks. Check on their official website
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:21:13

The donation thing was sarcasm but the bank thing was real.

If you combine your transaction with some of the newly minted coins after the fork, it will automatically be replay protected since those coins wont be present on the other chain and the transaction will become invalid on the other chain. But it isn't possible for everyone to acquire those coins since they are available only to miners.

Yes i know but i am just saying that they might mine empty block on purpose after the fork just to piss bitcoin users off and force them to use 2x instead.
@_date: 2017-10-14 11:57:42
That is a fair point but still they might attempt it. They have already been mining bch at a loss. They won't mind some additional loss.
@_date: 2017-10-14 11:43:03
But isnt their motive to make the price of bitcoin tank so that stop using the original chain and start using 2x chain?
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:41:33

They have the money. They mined the block.

We cant really calculate the total number of users. However due to the stats of businesses like coinbase and blockchain.info it is safe to assume that bitcoin users exceed ethereum users

I am an indian coder and i always insist my overseas customers to pay me in bitcoin.
