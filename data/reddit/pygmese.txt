Thanks, ill check that out.
I didn't say I see problems, I said I didn't see what problems it is solving. Sure, its new technology and cool, but what processes is it actually improving.
I live in the EU, and for me making international transfers has not cost a penny for me in a long time (inside or outside of the EU). But yeah banking practices are light years ahead of american ones here so that's probably why.
But yeah regarding the cost, I feel like that's just a question of banking technology. And I have a feeling banks are going to adopt their own internal cryptos to be able to make those transfers even faster and cheaper in the long run. I think BTC is just paving the way for the

Say we get there, BTC is now worth $30,000 and its seems to stabilize. Still no real shops accepting it, still as usable as it is now.
And the value ROI of buying in starts to be below standard stockmarkets. Do you still want hold your money in this? Say whatever you bought in at is now worth 3 million dollars. Would you be comfortable keeping your money 100% in bitcoin as a store of value?

It was just a hypothetical.
I am still having issues seeing what problem crypto really is solving for longevity.
I hear a lot about decentralization, which has good and bad sides to it, and I hear transaction costs which apparently anyway are higher with bitcoin right now.

How do you mean?
Are you implying it will be a better saving option that other traditional securities? Or just another security next to traditional ones. If the former, please elaborate.

Haha sure.
Just try to consider opinions outside the echo chamber, and think as critically as you can about anything you see and hear, to decrease the chance of ending up with everything lost. :)

I understand your point, but you do realize bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies for that matter are all  still one decision or whim away from being virtually worthless.
Here are a few which could happen at any moment:
* US Government realizes they want to keep the power that the USD has, and forbids trading in BTC
* Any other major government sees crypto as facilitator of money laundry and cyber crime
* Another major theft of Bitcoin
* Mass sell offs flooding the market 
Also just look at how 99% of people speak about cryptos on this subreddit and most other places. Everyone is in it for the get rich quick scheme and once the growth stabilizes and ROI get to similar level as normal forex investments. People will pull their money out to return it back into less risky investments. 
Once that happens it will be a race to the bottom, and suddenly liquidation might not be possible.
While this may not be likely to happen now, or maybe even in a few years. The thing is it can happen, at any given moment, and at such a speed that you cant liquidate your own back in time. 
So please don't pretend it is going to be less risky if its more "stable", standard currency checks and securities are not in place here.

I'll take that as you right now would not feel comfortable keeping 99.9% of your personal assets in bitcoin. As i thought. 
IMO it still even if the current issues were fixed to the better, not be as safe a store of value as gold. Not that I would even invest any money int something that boring.
I just don't see bitcoin outliving the easy access high risk high return investment it is now. Well see.

Even assuming a permanently continuous deflation (which on its own is unrealistic long term) what is the value of decentralization? What is so great about that? Evil banks etc or what? That centralized control allows assets to be safe, insured and stable -  something you actually can hold your savings in long term.


Governments can point out the fact that its main use is black market trade and money laundry and legalize it. It cant be shut down, it will just be useless.


What? Why would it stabilize to above inflation? That part of the sentence seemed very wishywashy, could you elaborate?
May I also ask you, with this kind of claims, are they based in real economics education, experience in asset trading, or could people over excited and over speculating value due to a new and exciting technology?
I'm seeing too many bitcoin investors who think they understand actual economics just cause they bough it early and made some money.
Everything in economics, every type of asset in the world works in a generally predictable way. why would cryptos be any different?

It was merely a hypothetical. Would you assuming this hypothetical see it as a lasting store of value?
