At least he's smart.
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:50:42
That's great news for Bitcoin.
Maybe in a few years from now we'll be able to not lose 40% of the money sent in fees.
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:27:42
Tether was generated from real USD dollars unlike the rest of Bitcoin, Ethereum and many other cryptocurrencies.
That is the difference between both and why Tether will hold it's value no matter what, unlike cryptos.
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:56:39
Guys, we have someone with a brain here.
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:54:37
That's great news for crypto currency.
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:04:04
Reddit is like an addiction lmao.
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:14:32
They actually do, you can withdraw to any coin you want, not only USDT.
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:23:32
It's just people spreading FUD.
I've got quite some money on Bitfinex and even bought more during this dip so yeah.
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:16:08
Good news for crypto again.
Hopefully this brings my Bitfinex wallet value a plus.
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:51:59
Yeah, and they don't give a fuck about Americans, also known as people who ruin everything.
It's funny how they issue a subpoena to Bitfinex and Tether but no US citizens are allowed to trade on their site.
What's shady now? Americans trying to control everything and manipulate.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:38:52
Nice to see more people is trying to keep up the mood for everyone!
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:27:00
Well that's interesting.
Might aswell turn tables with the current situation.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:29:02
It actually does not help, customers bitching with no real arguments and not trying to motivate won't help the company fix stuff anytime soon.
It actually brings the morale down and the only thing you achieve is delayed support.
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:06:13
It's true that's stupid money but it's still money and people likes money.
Also, about the bitfinex sell walls I haven't seen many to be honest, perhaps I'm just always too late.
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:17:49
This has been happening for a while, nothing new for us veterans.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:51:58
Yeah, so ironic it's not even funny.
I am closely watching bitfinex now and it's looking worse than yesterday although it should be looking better.
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:03:42
Santander from Spain hasn't said anything about cryptos.
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:43:37
It's just funny how 1 EUR is $1.24 usd.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:23:01
That's not an alligator, that's a snake.
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:33:13
The last bitcoin is brighter then the other one.
It's like a Lightning strike it.
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:51:49
Wow, I see someone is butthurt here for not being able to get into Bitfinex.
Did the $10k minimum cut you off?
As far as I know Bitfinex is the  exchange out there.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:04:37
I don't think it will hit $8000 tho.
People won't allow it to, too many people invested too much as to let it drop that much.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:05:12
Just wanted to drop by and say BTC is better than gold.
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:08:47
Another reason why bitcoin has the price it has.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:57:56
People is moving to other markets, faster, safer, with lower fees and bitcoin will end up like a gold piece.
There won't be such thing as Bitcoin anymore, it's the original one and no matter how many transactions it will still be the one, for the future.
@_date: 2018-01-10 10:30:45
That's great news for bitcoin.
Can't wait to start trading with it again on bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:51:47
It's for new accounts, old users can still access all features.
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:47:18
I'm telling you he is not.
He's either getting paid a lot by other exchanges to ruin Bitfinex and Tether or he's just straight crazy.
@_date: 2018-01-20 19:58:08
Nice share.
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:21:56
That's why you cannot trust all exchanges, gotta be careful who you trust with your money.
I only trust bitfinex and so far I'm doing fine.
Glad I wasn't involved in the Mt Gox thing.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:48:27
If only that was true... hahah
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:00:37
Well then don't even bother entering this world.
The FUD will always be part of the crypto space since it's what gives it volatility and that's what people likes, they want to make a quick buck.
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:11:44
This is great news!
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:18:51
Use the demo version.
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:45:46
Anyone starting a GoFundMe on this?
@_date: 2018-01-10 10:31:42
Bitcoin is a infinite growing coin.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:56:12
It's not even that much for people interested in trading for real.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:54:44
That's a great use of bitcoin and wealth.
More people who reached moon with BTC or ETH should do something like this.
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:59:38
$20 fee for a $5 drink?
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:00:05
You've sent it on the 2nd of january, just wait for them to fix, they've got a huge delay due to the inmense number of users that spam the support system.
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:53:56
BTC and ETH the true coins.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:39:47
With all the US shit  you want them to show all the money to the governments?
You realize how much of a fucked up situation it is right?
They can't get a legal 3rd party because they would have to disclose the amounts and I am pretty sure there is much more than 3b in their accounts.
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:04:22
It will drop a little bit more before actually coming back to $16k
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:34:56
Who wants to buy me 2 pizzas?
Paying 10000 rubles in BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:55:24
Crazy nice, great addition to the community.
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:34:12
If you guys are from the US then you only got a few options, like Binance or so.
Else, if you're not I'd strongly recommend using Bitfinex, they do require a $10k deposit but that's perfectly fine if you want to trade for real.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:23:47
This meme is so good.
If you take a look on bitfinex right now you'll see EVERYTHING, completely EVERYTHING is red.
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:30:32
Woz always gives the best interviews.
Great to see him talking good about Bitcoin, but it will only live like that, gold-a-like.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:56:03
We're in 2017, trends don't repeat themselves.
I'm buying some ETH on bitfinex cause I know it will be rising soon.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:52:02
True, why not create something new instead?
Bcash is just another coin and should have it's own name or call itself Bcash and not Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:48:53
It will hit in a few hours over $12k on bitfinex.
Just watch.
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:35:37
It was about damn time.
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:02:33
Doesn't seem to be down for me at now.
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:57:21
Don't bother, I posted that and it was downvoted to oblivion.
People just upvote FUD.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:41:08
didn't get to see it completely and the full order book is too big for me to load so yeah.
we'll see when he does it again on a higher price.
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:51:54
I'm pretty sure they could have went with a better alternative.
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:10:05
Bitfinex has been the best for me so far.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:43:12
The people that have bought over $10k+.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:57:06
This will bounce back soon. just gotta hold.
am watching on bitfinex and it looks good to me.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:07:50
Rollercoaster my friend, remember that.
This is a rollercoaster..
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:42:36
This is a 50/50.
I turst them,  you may not, but in all the time that I've been using them I had no issues whatsoever.
If I have no issue with them and I see people who are not customers of theirs, trying to make false claims, then the problem is that people are getting paid most likely to create such false claims.
They get nothing from the claims but a worse crypto space and nobody benefits from that but people who sold early and are now butthurt.
Give me a valid reason on why so many people, who don't even use bitfinex, are creating such claims.
And when you talk about the rest of crypto exchanges that use tether, they are all innocent.
What's wrong with the world?
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:22:07
This is actually something interesting to get into.
Not many new things show up nowadays and this one is something really useful.
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:41:16
That's a fee I can afford for $1000.
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:02:27
Well that's fucked up people doing this but it happens a lot IRL so here it's even easier.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:46:02
People have to remember that Crypto is global.
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:49:10
If you get the right people to talk about it then it can have value.
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:00:07
You've made a great choice of starting with bitfinex, is one of the largest trading exchanges out there and they know their stuff.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:56:42
Experts from a website called "usethebitcoin", no thanks.
I'll buy ETH from bitfinex while it's still low tho.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:22:10
Bitfinex is the best choice out of all those, bittrex has been giving lots of problems and cryptopia is quite sketchy lately.
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:43:54
Bitfinex allows you to buy most of the coins with FIAT.
Take a look.
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:50:21
Everyone wants to know about everything nowaday.
It's just how the world works, how society moves.
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:21:21
This guy registered a week ago and is already posting fud, typical newcomer.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:50:41
This is quite interesting.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:08:38
This is a meme I can relate to.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:24:46
That's how people works.
Sorry for you having to hear all of this.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:26:12
You don't get the use of Bitcoin then.
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:44:25
People who are having trouble should sotp bitching and move on to other exchanges.
If you truly feel you want a better exchange just go with bitfinex, in 2 weeks it will be opening registrations.
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:34:01
Great read and I feel sorry for the people that need to live through that.
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:13:59
Yeah, everyone reads about something and are already convinced it's real.
What you FIND on your own and you believe is the only thing that's real, for you, and won't be for anybody else unless you manipulate them into that.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:13:27
If you think checking the twitter account "bitfinexed" is enough proof or he should be trusted then I'm sorry but I've got to tell you.
That guy is crazy mad, check his tweet history and you'll see how much of a crazy obsession he's got with Bitfinex.
Searching on the internet is not researching, take a look at this sub and you'll see how much clickbait, fake news, FUD and lots of shit posts are posted daily.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:51:51
They got subpoenaed in december.
They dismissed the auditor and people took advantage of that to spread FUD.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:55:53
No, they are not goint o sell that low, they're gonna make higher sell orders thus keeping the price at the same they bought.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:28:09
Already got an account, but yeah, send it my way.
I'll use it as a bot account.
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:29:18
Well, I know a great exchange that works better than both.
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:07:40
Looks up for me.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:25:55
Man, this is getting boring.
Keep a post and spread good FUD at least.
So many 100 word posts are boring.
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:14:18
Yup, it's always better to move to an exchange and make some money instead of just leaving.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:44:37
Binance has been acting like shit lately, they have no experience so it's normal in them to do so, Poloinex must be new :P, Bitfinex should be the only one to trust.
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:07:50
That's just amazing.
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:57:51
That's interesting.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:03:00
The whole market is a meme with the americans trying to manipulate it so yeah.
Wouldn't surprise me if it worked.
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:06:29
Nothing, DYOR and don't ask people.
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:36:59
Thing about bitcoin is that it's moved by people, everyone forgets about that.
But people are such hypocrites that would make their families lose money for them to win, they tell them about how great bitcoin is and their families buy, he then sells and the families are the ones who hold the pressure.
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:51:30
The clickbaits are getting worse and worse every day.
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:25:32
Yeah, if the flash drive breaks you lose it.
Best thing is to store everything on paper if you want to really have it secured.
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:18:45
If Google took a step into the crypto space this big, trust me, crypto world would get so closer.
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:49:02
Bitfinex is actually the only true best exchange out there but people just ignore it because they think $10k is a lot, but we're talking about real money to be made not a few bucks that will after be eaten by fees.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:56:57
You can give a try to ethfinex, it's from the same group.
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:12:15
Old memories.
Best thing is to learn from the past and improve in our future.
I've bought some coins and now they seem little but in a few years they might be huge.
Last coins I bought were NEO on Bitfinex so, NEO to the moon!
@_date: 2018-01-15 09:53:12
This will be funny to follow.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:57:22
No lambos, no moon.
We're with BTC for the tech.
Oh, and the fees, the $20 fees.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:22:19
Discounts are great, take a look at bitfinex and watch all these discounted coins.
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:05:55
That's nice.
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:09:13
It is time, I've been buying but not only Bitcoin, also Ethereum and NEO on Bitfinex, stacking up on them.
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:49:10
We're getting closer, can't wait to see how this works out.
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:56:15
Your name seems oddly weird and retarded.
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:00:38
News were fake and over exagerrated thus there is no other explanation.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:09:38
That's sick!
This will hopefully bring up the mood to the rest of the people!
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:33:05
There's a ton more buys then sells on bitfinex if you take a look.
People are trying to get in low so they're in when it hits $30k.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:23:07
It's getting eaten already.
Looks kinda nice tbh.
It was 1,500 BTC @ 11,000 and now BTC is rising.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:02:45
$10k is actually a help for bitcoin and the rest of alts, no newbie traders that get scared easily, like you I suppose, get to join thus keep a more safe market.
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:14:29
I feel you bro, we're on the same boat.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:09:20
I'm more interested in how he's done it.
Teach us the HODLing ways Aston.
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:15:58
So you're telling me it's safer to keep a volatile cryptocurrency than a 1:1 USD backed currency?
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:58:12
That's actually impressive.
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:12:05
Bitcoin and Ethereum both are good coins, ETH built something new, BTC was something new, but the rest of the coins are just.. coins.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:51:52
If it wasn't that governments want to control cryptocurrency and manage it the way they want and they didn't move that big amount of money then I guess they would be showing their "store" at anytime.
But due to the nature of their business I think it's normal they do not do that.
What I do wonder is where their servers are, if someone was to know where, that'd be a serious security flaw.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:41:48
Yeah, it's an exchange for real traders.
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:52:37
Lightning pizza here we come!
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:45:52
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:45:13
This was all market manipulation.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:00:50
The best thing would be to sell it to some local buyer at localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:15:42
Such grandma, you must be a lucky guy.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:02:14
Nothing can match the quality of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:10:46
There is no better sub than this one.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:40:28
Doesn't make any sense but yeah.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:40:05
Why is there so many worthless posts in this sub
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:21:26
This is why I love Andreas 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:59:35
People who have been selling are gonna regret soon.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:22:18
I get to buy Bitcoin at low price, it's like sale for me. No need to worry about it, it's temporary drama.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:59:59
Good thing to get it out.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:41:19
Will be interested to check it out when I go home, looks good.
@_date: 2018-06-07 11:43:28
Bitcoin ain't the thing for this, not even ETH is.
@_date: 2018-03-01 17:48:11
For buying and selling I can recommend you bitfinex, best in the business right now and ever since it started .
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:12:38
Don't know where you're living but sounds like America.
@_date: 2018-03-05 15:52:14
So, if I give you 100,000 in EUR and you give me the equal value in USD, will there be a problem? From my knowledge, there is none, but if he converts CRYPTO to FIAT, that's a crime.
@_date: 2018-03-05 14:18:08
Feels like we're going mainstream, I don't understand why people thought cryptos would be praised or some shit.
@_date: 2018-03-05 14:19:37
Man, that's fucked up.
We can't get adoption if the law is gonna chase people using crypto forever.
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:45:31
Bitfinex, best one so far.
@_date: 2018-03-03 04:13:40
Bitfinex existed since 2012, hard to believe that people used those kind of weird services.
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:31:04
He's getting roasted on reddit for this now.
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:28:52
Bitfinex is your choice, it's the one that has the biggest BTC volume, longest standing around and the leading exchange.
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:50:59
The title is so fucking bad, sad to see nobody here actually thinks with their brain but with their wallets.
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:46:25
From the last crash to now bitfinex has gotten another 30k bitcoins in their cold wallet.
@_date: 2018-03-02 02:14:03
It's crazy how they have almost the same after reducing double of what bitfinex reduced.
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:03:46
Yeah I know that, I've been here for quite some time but this is the first time I can't decide on what to do, not even feeling like selling half tbh.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:08:55
You're quite a genius man, teach us your ways Master Satoshi.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:02:14
That's me when I know how to control my losses.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:51:58
That's a much better one lmao.
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:19:00
Yeah but best thing to do is buy from now and keep buying as it drops, once it starts rising you keep on selling and will always make profit.
@_date: 2018-03-05 14:18:38
Mainstream != Adoption.
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:28:31
1 doge = 1 doge
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:12:16
Bitfinex is winning the race so far.
@_date: 2018-03-04 00:27:15
Once bitfinex did the rest started to join the race.
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:57:20
would be funny to see if only bittrex wasn't a scam.
fun fact is: bitfinex could afford most of the exchanges out there with all the cash they've got.
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:13:06
He actually was just telling people lies that they would love to follow.
@_date: 2018-03-04 01:01:46
Bitfinex adoption truly helped then.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:21:37
That's one of the most retarded conspiracies I've ever heard.
He's just a internet troll or memer if you wanna call it like that who enjoys seeing how others lose millions of dollars to his FUD.
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:17:53
I am not from the US, I can sell at anytime without any problem.

I'd rather use bitfinex but if you're not from the US it's quite impossible to so yeah.
From my own experience, bitfinex is 10x better than any other exchange out there.
Only thing they do are good is payment.
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:44:30
I've got way more than "half a bitcoin", that's why my doubt on what to do, it's too much to lose if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:31:31
No, they get most coins that have a working product or a good future ahead of them, it's not that easy to get on bitfinex so yeah.
I'd do use them over any other exchange.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:31:18
Just love how people speculate with the most logical stuff.
Searching for dead bodies when there's none.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:23:33
You're such a waste, keep on looking for dead bodies where there's none.
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:47:16
This is why I'm glad I'm an early adopter.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:07:58
That's fucked up on Coinbase and also the bitcoin site is so misleading, says bitcoin and then bitcoin cash.
You forget what you're using and if you're not really into this you'll fall for it and think you're buying something else or say that bitcoin is at $800 instead of the $8000 it is at.
Shady as fuck, as users said below.
@_date: 2018-03-05 13:39:48
I call that bullshit.
Can't belive how inmoral some people are, trying to make a buck of FUD is just not cool.
@_date: 2018-02-25 00:05:20
Bitfinex all the way.
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:24:35
And they never will, his only will is to destroy the bitcoin price and lead this to a chaos by spreading fake news.
People taking what that guy says seriously are probably people that sold in the early hundreds.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:04:40
The subpoena was from december, the south korea FUD is quite old now, facebook banned cryptos, that should actually be good, less scam ICOs.
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:39:06
Bitfinex is looking so great today.
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:45:09
If people stop bringing bullshit about bitfinex or tether and the bitgrail hack gets sorted out and people drop the drama then we can say we can end with the drop.
But this is not a correction, this is a drop because of those factors I've said above.
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:52:15
Man that's crazy, wondering if they got segwit.
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:01:14
Keep on spreading FUD, you're dooing well so far. /s
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:01:06
Actually no worries grow, it's just what the media wants you to think.
Bitfinex hasn't manipulated anything, and it's by far the best exchange out there.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:29:33
I'm pretty sure this is everyone every single day, not just today.
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:16:49
You're still finding ways of saying bitfinex is guilty for the bitcoin price but forget all the real world news that came out recently and that gave a "green flag" for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-14 01:37:02
Depends on which exchange you're using.
I'm using bitfinex to hold most of my coins I trade with and have the rest on a offline wallet.
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:22:53
There's always lots of buys when dips come so it's normal for them to move it.
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:41:57
I'd suggest to post in @_date: 2018-02-09 01:12:49
Buy buy buy, it's under $8k on bitfinex, prepare your bags and get ready for the $8.6k+ tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:52:52
Well, guess he's made enough cash from stupid fools donating as to stop by now.
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:32:37
No, but americans don't care about freedom of speech.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:16:31
The price goes down but also goes back up, the idea of lightning network is not so people "hold" bitcoins but to use them instantly by paying with fiat.
@_date: 2018-03-03 21:10:24
I'll wait for EOSFinex from Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:17:36
That's lovely.
Someone posting a real comment.
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:12:41
Bitfinex is not in America yet the americans still mess about.
Don't feel safer for "Being registered in The Netherlands".
Americans will find a way to screw you over.
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:53:41
You can trade with other coins and make it untraceable with Monero I think.
But it will always be on the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:55:14
It's actually under $7k now.
Take a look at bitfinex and see for yourself.
Discounted coins at it's best.
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:04:11
I am from Spain so yeah, I'm not that really informed on it but from posts that I've seen people highly suggest you not to daytrade of ridicoulous taxes.
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:02:41
Yeah but these russians were using those computers to work on nukes and they thought mining on them would be a good idea.
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:04:56
I'm safe with bitfinex, plus, I'm mostly playing daily thus there would be no point into withdrawing to a wallet.
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:15:27
Imagine now if you played with a whole lot more.
I'm trading a TON more on bitfinex and can tell you that's nothing, but it's a great start.
You should aim for something higher.
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:48:44
I'm having fun with my real bitcoin on bitfinex, just watching it change it's value all day.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:10:25
7.7k on bitfinex, time to buy.
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:32:10
I have actually made good profit off them so I don't know what missing money you're talking about.
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:58:54
Bitfinex just added segwit so we should see a decrease in fees.
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:24:12
I wonder if you're going to hold the coins or sell them for fiat.
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:46:05
Thanks to bitfinex for starting the race.
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:52:17
Bitfinex added recently segwit and coinbase added it later too following bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:11:28
It's a fact they fired their previous auditor and are searching for a new one.
If you wanta platform where work is done unprofesionally and where you can't trust what theydo just use kraken.
Bitfinex is taking it's time to actually perform a good audit from someone that can be trusted and also not disclose which banks are used or bank accounts, confidence is really important when it comes to this and more with all the risk of having the cash at plain sight.
@_date: 2018-03-03 21:27:53
Best moment to buy on bitfinex right now.
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:14:36
This is like the russians scientists mining bitcoin with the super computers they had.
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:50:16
Great video to watch.
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:09:06
I guess that means we'll see more bitcoin action for some time, I was actualyl expecting it to become more of a "gold" type of thing.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:30:26
That sounds great for the US were taxes are crazy, hopefully this will help will adoption.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:54:07


Well, guess this concludes the lecture for today lads.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:50:46
This won't be enough for the stupid minds who expect them to show them where the money is, how to access it and even give them the logins to the banks so they can take all the cash.
What a shitshow has this thing became.
It's getting to such a non-sense level that it's making me wonder if we're actually moving forward or going back in the past.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:03:06
I don't think this will get the attention it deserves.
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:39:02
Use bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:13:57
He's aiming to the moon.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:15:18
because of people wanting to control the most coins before it becomes adopted by mass and gets to be the most expensive coin to exist.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:26:19
Sell me your cryptos for 50%.
I'll be trading them on bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:58:19
You're forgetting it's an exchange, not a payment processor like coinbase, that's why there's no that much of a movement.
Once the prices drop a little more there should be some movement since people will be depositing to buy other coins or to sell for USD and wait.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:35:37
How many doge for that cat?
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:45:57
They just want to make a quick buck off click-baits.
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:12:13
Boy, you really bought into that FUD huh.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:17:33
Well, glad to know I bought at $6.5k and $7k on bitfinex yesterday.
Feel quite good now.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:07:47
That ain't safe, for your heart.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:23:16
They're the leading exchange for a reason.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:55:08
I feel like there should be another dip before the major increase, not sure why but I feel it.
I might sell half of my holdings from bitfinex and just straight wait for it to dip, if it doesn't then oh well.
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:42:16
That's a $100 profit in 2 min.
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:14:28
Because it's a trading platform, they move a lot of cash INTERNALLY, withdrawals are mostly FIAT and deposits are from people trading, they have less transactions but of bigger volume.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:14:16
Who's let the sink out?
@_date: 2018-02-10 14:49:33
No, it actually is the best exchange out there with the best platform aswell as the best margin trading offer.
Take a look.
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:09:52
If you take a look at what's happening when everyone can buy bitcoin and sell whenever they want you'd know why that's how it is.
Look at all those weak hands leading to $9k instead of holding it to $15k.
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:19:05
Worth the wait.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:34:10
I was watching the price on bitfinex now and all I can think of is "The floor is the limit".
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:20:27
A bunch of good news is exactly what we need to get back on track to the moon.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:52:25
So, I've got a few bitcoins bought from bitfinex when it was 8.2k and I feel like selling now and wait for it to dip again but also feel like this is the last chance to get in at such low price... not sure what to do.
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:48:05
And also the whole story the guy tells doesn't make any sense.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:56:35
We're going back down, take that off, it's driving the prices down.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:08:58
Take a look at the volume and you'll make yourself an idea of how much they move daily.
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:33:26
That's mathematically correct.
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:30:39
It's funny because you can even turn around this gif in case it drops.
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:47:20
Well, I think it's fud because of the following reasons:
· A bunch of random reddit accounts started sending links with faked data and assuming that tether was creating coins in order to inflate bitcoins' price yet they did not use their ***simple brains*** to think logical and understand that the cryptocurrencies have evolved in such a way that even the biggest companies out there believe they're a game-changer.
· Nobody has ever showed how tether does not have the cash in the bank accounts, they simply ***said and speculated*** they didn't and have been just trying to blackmail a legit business into doing what ***they*** want and not what the community wants.
· A few guys spreading missinformation using click-bait titles and using all kind of techniques just to try to make their arguments true when the truth is you are just simply ***speculating*** and have done nothing other than ***spreading stupid speculations***.
· You have been spreading that bullshit and click-bait titles on reddit for a few weeks now and started out of nowhere, as if someone is paying you to throw shit at a legitimate company? What legit company uses FUDsters?
· As I've always said, you are just a random guy that is getting paid to missinform everyone, spread FUD and try to destroy the cryptocurrencies as we know them, only ones that will benefit from that will be banks, and guess what, we've seen yesterday that a polish ***bank has paid FUDsters to spread FUD all over reddit and youtube***.
· Once again, what legit company uses fudsters?
· There is only one single reason on why you would be trying so hard to destroy tether, they do not disclose their banks and noobdy can close accounts they don't know whose those accounts are, feels bad your bank is getting fucked but hiring ***FUDders won't help at all***.
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:32:50
I think she got the wrong idea about cryptocurrencies.
