Agree. 
I would sell back the btc to coinbase, and buy some crypto OTR using localbitcoins, preferably monero. And then convert monero to btc in  a hardware wallet.

Looks like an “offline clickbait” adding a fancy hype word to make people come to their shitty conference

I saw the project of that law - and it is ridiculous. They want to give the exclusive right of buying and selling crypto to licenced organisations. The most interesting point, those organisations will keep the private keys of customers’ wallets. 
Putin wants to try to  centraliZe  control  of crypto.
Russia will be strongly against anything Putin and his friends can’t Control and take a huge part of the profit for themselves.

Btw, a guy was arrested and kept in jail because he had an exit node of tor in his home computer. The guy is a mathematics  teacher , not some crook.

They try to keep the centralisation control of crypto. I believe that is strongly against the idea of crypto. 
Crypto is all about freedom of choice. IMO.

If you want bitcoint to grow, not just hodl but try to adopt it.
Use it for buying goods and services, ask your providers to accept bitcoint payments and yes hold some btc in your wallet. If you earn money / try to ask payments in btc for you. It’s not the “get righ fast” thing you may see in YouTube and some populist resources, but I believe that is the only way to make the price grow.
That trading story is gambling for the regular user, it requires a lot of research and time to learn and you have to know the market whales who move the prices.
