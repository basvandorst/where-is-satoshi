Are you for real? what are you going to base performance on?  ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?, Research, Knowledge, analysis... OMFG, please don't message me agian I'm in some fucked part of the internet.

I like stocks because they equal more than a single hedge fund and I'm not 14.   
@_date: 2019-01-04 00:12:56
Yeah because the richest investor in the world sure must not know what he's doing.
He didnt buy BTC because He's a long term investor not a get rich quick guy, which by the way is the best way to get rich.
@_date: 2019-01-04 23:02:12
This doesn't even make any sense, like what comparison is it trying to make?
Yes bitcoin is extremely small, It's not even worth a single hedge fund or stock, what does that have to do with being late?  this sounds like it was written (well 'tweeted') by someone who has no grasp on financials
@_date: 2019-01-15 02:29:55
sure man whatever distracts you from the talking about the actual topic at hand.
@_date: 2019-01-04 01:10:13
so naive.

Thing with bubbles,everyone is taken in by them at one point or another, the difference is people learn and accept it, where as with BTC they are just clueless.  I have made good decisions and bad decisions, one of the things I eventually learned is not to get emotionally vested into anything financial, if you do it's going to inject biases conscious or subconscious that will make you not make good decisions. btc guys seem to have this in spades. information always trumps belief systems.
@_date: 2019-01-07 22:52:03
It is a bubble.
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:44:35
its a saying, but again you guys are immaturely pedantic.
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:03:23
it's an expression you pedantic idiot.  the fact that you all get so mad is telling itself.  when I owned netflix and people came in and poo-poo'd it I didnt instantly react like someone hitting my knee with a hammer, but then I'm not a a fool, aka you. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:44:48
the fuck?  is this how belief-stricken fuck-up you guys are?  that when someone makes an honest post all you can do is attack it and drone on and on like children? Jesus..
@_date: 2019-01-15 15:22:40
Warren buffet is risk adverse as well. It’s how most good investors do well :) 
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:30:21
No idea what a FUD is, but then I'm not a 12 year old 99%'r bitcoin guy.
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:29:44
thanks call me when you reach puberty.
@_date: 2019-01-15 15:26:37
Omg  yeah in a vacuum. You guys are so green. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 15:21:28
That’s not how this works. Omfg do you guys seriously think that? Dude take my honest advice get out while you can. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 22:39:19
Yeah Interest them in something that's been steadily losing money for 400 days, you are a jackass.
You know I have been into financials a long time, I have bought currencies, bonds, stock, funds..etc.. and the one rule is you never get family or friends in because if they lost money you would feel terrible. bit is the only thing I have seen people reccomend their friends/daughters/ co-workers buy and lose their shirts sometimes, and they act like there's something bigger at stake so it's OK,
Well NO it's Not OK to give bad advice. Bitcoin is finished. It will never leave, but it will remain a fart in financial history, you are being a jackass even if you might be unaware of it.
@_date: 2019-01-04 01:31:57
what about it? are you new to stocks?
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:29:31
you are all kids in here arnt you?  I go to any other financial forum and people talk like adults, you guys talk like kids. again, telling.
@_date: 2019-01-04 15:55:39
Omg you are all so naieve in here, I wish I could see your ages to know if you really are that uneducated or just young. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:28:48
apparently you dont have eyeballs or a brain. I don't have a horse in that race, I just dont like people giving bad advice.
@_date: 2019-01-04 00:59:40
not zero, but buy netflix and checking your balance 5 years from now is gonna do way better.
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:48:01
no idea what that means man.
@_date: 2019-01-15 02:28:56
no, it was meant to denote your immaturity at my honest post, I hope the irony of your subsequent post aren't lost on you.
@_date: 2019-01-15 19:52:29
you guys just have no logic.  
First off what does the age of my account matter? don't look desperate to poke holes or anything.
Second, past performance has nothing to do with future performance this is learned on Day 1 if you to a entry level financial course. Enron must have been a steal at $1 a share, it was at $100 just last year!!!  
Do you see how much of a fucktard you sound like now? good, fix it. and you're welcome.
@_date: 2019-01-15 03:30:14
almost like a bubble.
@_date: 2019-01-03 23:57:29
It was a bubble. Deal with it they happen.
@_date: 2019-01-14 22:54:13
hobfully convincing this guy to keep his financial blunders private.
@_date: 2019-01-10 15:03:19
Because none of this is real.  You guys make it sound like bitcoin is real. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 00:02:21
really? wow, speechless at how retarded that comment was.
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:00:17
no I buy stocks mainly.
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:50:12
alright well I have work to do man and you're clearly not interested in an adult conversation, so have fun and welcome to the block list
@_date: 2019-01-04 02:01:50
ARE YOU RETARDED? Most long term holders are long term holders?  *No shit.*
*BTC is NOT a long term holding.  coke and microsoft, bonds and realestate are.*
