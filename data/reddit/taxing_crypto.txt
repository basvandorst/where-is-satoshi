You are correct that the unreported gains would need to be reported with an amendment!
The gains from 2017 would have no bearing on the losses in 2018. However, it would have an indirect effect. All of the activity in 2017 would have an impact on the cost basis of the coins transacted in the future.

Great point! This was our first reddit post. We have updated the post and added it is only applicable to US taxpayers. Thanks for the feedback!

The problem is the law is not clear, not that it is flawed. Also, I believe that your cash deposit analogy is somewhat flawed.
The crypto market is very complex, and it is extremely difficult to determine the value of a forked coin at the time of the split. In addition, it is definitely an arguable position that a forked coin has no market value at the time of the split as it has not been previously traded on the open market and it is not entirely clear whether there will be a market for the coin.

This is a fair point. The ***Cesarini v. United States*** case is a classic case in tax law and it is true, in that case the taxpayers found money in a piano and the money was included as income the year it was discovered. I believe it is hard to analogize a forked coin to finding cash in a piano. The treatment discussed above is only for forked or airdropped tokens.
I've seen the below analogy cited before and I think it is a better analogy for forked assets. The analogy is to treat the initial token as if it were a cherry tree. A cherry tree is more valuable when it produces cherries, but when a cherry grows on the tree that doesn't create a taxable event. The cherry tree always had the ability to produce cherries, just as the coin always had the ability to be forked into a new token:
“The cherry tree is going to grow, it’s going to produce branches, it’s going to produce leaves, and it’s going to produce cherries. And the cherries could even be picked. But none of those things is a taxable event, the taxable event is the sale of the cherries.”

This post is applicable to US Taxpayers only!

When you receive the forked coins you can choose to not recognize any income. The coins will take on a 0 cost basis. When you sell the coin you would recognize the entire amount of the proceeds as a gain. However, if you never touch/sell the coins there would be no taxable event! 
If you choose to recognize income on the day the token is received, the coin will then take on the cost basis of the income you have recognized. That basis would be used to determine whether there was a gain or loss at the time of disposition.

Would be nice if the US was the same!

This is an approach that can be taken. When you receive the forked coins you can choose to not recognize any income. The coins will take on a 0 cost basis. When you sell the coin you would recognize the entire amount of the proceeds as a gain. However, if you never touch/sell the coins there would be no taxable event!
