When it comes to gold the possibility of space mining should not be ignored.

I agree tainted EUR rather than tainted BTC was far more likely. I commented on this here:  and included a link to the original Bitcoin Talk post.

There are very significant regional differences with Quebec for the most part being the cheapest. Here is another source

Break the DRM in a PlayStation 3, install GNU / Linux on it and use it to mine Bitcoin. This was legal in Canada at the time. 
Also in early 2010 it was possible to buy Bitcoin in the open market. Price around 100 - 350 BTC to 1 USD. New Liberty Standard and Bitcoin Marketplace were the early exchanges. It was traded in terms of Pecunix, a form of digital gold. MTGox came later around June 2010.
Edit: Last but not least use the heat produced from the BItcoin mining to stay warm during the cold Canadian winter.

Mining is legal in Canada now. Circumventing (breaking) DRM is illegal Canada now under the *Copyright Act* unless an exception applies.  There are exceptions for protection of personal information (privacy) and computer / network security among other exceptions that if they apply can be used to legally circumvent (break) DRM in Canada

It has fallen on hard times but is very much alive. 
I actually run a Namecoin node

Or the site is not in French or provides a French language option. This could make contracts made on the site not enforceable in Quebec.

This assumes there is a willing buyer of tainted BTC for XMR. A few more incidents such as this:  and more Monero and more Monero holders will wise up to the risk selling XMR for BTC outside of an AML / KNC exchange. 
It is not like Monero holders are not aware of issues with tainted BTC.

Yes but the individual transactions were broadcast at one point. All an attacker has to do is keep the individual transaction information. What this does is provide a very dangerous false sense of fungibility and privacy. 
If information is broadcast publicly, the fact that it is is not stored on a public blockchain does not make the information private. The publicly broadcast information can be stored in privately controlled databases making it far more dangerous than the Bitcoin blockchain.
Edit: Consider a Bitcoin example. A &gt; B &gt; C &gt; D where address A is spent into B, B is spent into C and C is spent in to D. A, B and C are now empty so they can be pruned from the blockchain. Now consider that say C has a very high level of taint. If one just looks at the pruned blockchain one does not see C? The question becomes is D free from taint? Well it depends. If one only looks at the pruned blockchain it appears that D is free from taint; however who really thinks that those who applied the taint and those who support the taint actually pruned C away from their copies of the blockchain? The result is the appearance of fungibility and privacy where in reality none exists.

Why not sell it and buy something you believe in? Keeping a coin one does not believe in an exchange simply inflates its price by frustrating market discovery.
