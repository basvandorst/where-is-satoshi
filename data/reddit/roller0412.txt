What is stopping from me keeping the coins? Because that's a scam and continuous arbitrage profit would give so much more than just keeping it. Imagine $10,000 circulates between you and me 10 times. Then your one time profit of $1500 is multiplied by 10 times.

LOL. I can't come up with any counterargument against it. You win.

Only if I knew a foreign friend who’s interested in crypto...

The whole duration the money is in crypto will be less than 10 minutes. Unless BTC drops by more than 20% in 10 minutes, we're making profits.. I'll only tell the other partner to purchase coins when there is market premium, and when I'm ready to timely sell.

No worries about account problems. I have confirmed with Korean IRS. I work in an accounting field.

That's kind of Coinbase! Well I want it to be an imbedded function for more adoption.

This is passing down the inherent risk of bitcoin to the user. Bitcoin can have a better control of its users rather than making them change their address often. Moving funds costs money too.

Japan's debt will be a bigger burden for borrowers! Imagine a japanese entity borrows $500. If inflation in JPY, they now have to pay more in JPY to pay for $500

I see. Didn't know they're in Yen
