or like, take your profits when you're up like 100%+...
really, with any investment instrument, whether its stocks, futures, options, whatever.... you need to have a target profit level that you are committed to pulling out at. It doesn't matter if you end up getting there and thinking it's going to go higher... you take at least SOME of it off. leaving it all on the fire hoping it will continue to rise is where OP went wrong, and that's ESPECIALLY bad when you're playing with options, or any other derivatives, which expire at a set date and are prone to dramatic swings in value as a function of many factors at play. 
it's one thing to go all-in on some stock and hold it for a long time. yeah, you might miss the peak. you can always hold it longer. but if you buy a shitpile of call options, and you miss the peak, they typically crash to zero. and then they vanish come expiration. at least with a stock, you still have SOMETHING in your portfolio when it crashes. it might go below where you bought it, representing a loss... but at least you can still sell it all for something. when you fuck up and let your options expire, you're just fucked.

that's not really fair. options exist as insurance. they exist so that you can own several hundred shares of some underlying stock, and then in times of uncertainty, you can use options as a way to lock in potential profits (or lock a maximum possible loss) in advance in case things get weird. 
now, playing with options for stuff that you do not already own... that's a different story. you're essentially trading insurance policies on assets that you don't have. like buying fire insurance for your neighbor's house for like a couple months at a time and just hoping that somewhere in there, it burns to the ground and you can collect the payout. 
consider that you own 100 shares of CompanyA stock that you bought at $80/share. you've had it for a few years and it's now at $100. you obviously want it to go up forever, and keep holding it. but we know that's not how life works. it might go down. who knows... it might never go back up to any given level ever again. So you could sell a call against your 100 shares at $120. you collect a little cash for it, and if it goes over $120, you lose out on a little profit, but you'd then end up selling your whole 100 shares at that price, which is still a big profit from where you originally bought them. Alternatively, you could buy a put at $90, so that if the stock keeps going up, nothing happens and spent a little cash to own that put. but if it crashes, say to $70/share, which would be a loss on your whole 100 shares, you would have the right to sell them all at $90/share which would have locked in a $10/share profit over where you bought them several years ago. insurance. 
sure, you can go in and bet all your money on black and just buy call options with the hope that they become more valuable in the next 3 weeks before they expire, but that's just degenerate speculation/gambling. that's how you lose a lot of money in a very short time. It's not the fault of options- it's the fault of applying a bad investment strategy to a valuable instrument.

i really like him when he's being more serious and not like how he is in 'The Office'. 
even when he's being funny in the office, just when he's a little more normal.. and just a little *off* rather than his typical Micheal nonsense.

i crossposted it to r/investing and got banned... crying from laughter right now. I guess the ol' pump-n-dump is not an approved investment strategy over there.

i mean, the song is just laid over top, so it very well could be a gorilla  flailing about with some drumsticks. the real reason you'd know he's not a real gorilla would be that a real gorilla swinging drumsticks around at those drums would DESTROY that drumkit unless they were like, anchored in concrete and made entirely of steel.
