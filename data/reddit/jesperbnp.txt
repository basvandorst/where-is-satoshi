Seen some invites elsewhere and even tried joining some group. Never got so far as to trade any advertised coin though.
You will get the name of the coin slightly earlier than the other members if you manage to hook in a number of new users but you are not allowed to 'advertise'. Hence the incentive for private message.

They are just very different personalities with different motives.
Andreas tours the world talking about bitcoin as his passion trying to educate everybody about it. See his videos. He doesn't talk about his wealth. Only recently, the community got to know he was not even a millionaire.
Roger is a 'selfmade millionaire' (so he claims) that invested in Bitcoin related activity early on. He recently freaked out in an interview because the interviewer wouldn't stop calling bitcoin cash "bcash". Now he takes the credit for making Andreas a millionaire because he poor-shamed him (which caused a spur in community donations to Andreas). Roger wants Bitcoin Cash to be recognized as "the real Bitcoin" and runs bitcoin.com which even promotes his gaming site.
There are countless other differencies that could be mentioned.

I like Coinomi on a smartphone. Of course a hardware wallet would be more safe, or even paper wallets for long-term cold storage.

I believe the mBTC thing is handled by their payment provider - don't remember who it was. On the invoce I got by mail, it is listed in my local currency and just states that payment method was "Bitcoin".

In Denmark, every citizen has an online storage for receiving electronic mail like government documents (typically in the form of .pdf documents). It's called 'e-boks'. We also have the possibility for uploading a few megabytes of private documents to it.
It's supposed to be fairly secure and private. However, an important feature is that it allows your family to gain access to it in case of your death (if they know there are something important in there). I have made a bitmap image of my seed (to make it non-searchable by text algos), encrypted it in a zip file using a strong password that my relatives already know for other purposes, and uploaded it to my private storage. Might not be a complete bullet proof method of storing my seed but it's the best compromise I could come up with at the time being.

@_date: 2018-08-27 11:07:40
I got blocked by Faketoshi on Twitter today. I have been following him for the entertainment value but got into a short discussion with him.
Basically he argued that 1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr was not a burner address. It seems he speculated that it was just a vanity address whereas 1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX would be a better burner address.
I pointed out that the latter part ("UWLpVr") is a checksum needed to actually send coins to that address whereas the actual address part is "1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" (Obivously a burner address).
The valid address is needed so that anyone can send coins to it: "The Counterparty proof-of-burn was set up so that anyone who sent bitcoin to the address 1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr during the one-time burn period in January 2014 automatically received XCP in return in proportion to the amount of bitcoin they burnt.".
No sane wallets lets you send coins to an invalid address!
CSW just did not get that point and insisted that they should use an obviously invalid address.
A few polite tweets later and I was blocked. Talk about a guy who doesn't want to argue about facts. LOL.
Unfortunately most of the thread is lost now but I attached some of it in the image.

Yeah. I just needed something simple that was supported by generic terminal programs. Was probably xmodem.
@_date: 2018-08-27 12:37:29
Yes, just like the Counterparty burn address which Faketoshi gave as example (1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr,  ).
Point is, you HAVE to be able to send coins to it (i.e. must have a valid checksum). So you cannot avoid that the last part is 'different', just like your 111...4oLvT2 address above.
@_date: 2018-08-28 20:47:44
Thanks to  for teaching him :-)
Edit: added some details:
Effective datarate for a 56kbps modem would be around 5.6k kbyte/s.
Ignoring effects caused by error-correction and compression, that would require a transmission time of (32M/5.6K) ~6000 seconds = ~1.66 hours
But I guess CSW never tried downloading large files over a modem link.
@_date: 2018-08-29 08:09:08
well.. nitty-gritty details... a 56k modem could even handle 56.6k but then you have to deduct the overhead of error detection and correction.
Also, you would never actually get a 56.6k link. According to this, you would get 53.3k in US max.: 
In any cases, we're talking hours not minutes.
@_date: 2018-08-29 06:02:43
Yeah, you are right. "Baud" was not really used when switching to the more advanced modulation techniques.
Had to read up on it to figure out that a 56.6kbps (V.90) modem actually used a 8K baudrate downstream to transfer the 56600 bits per second because each symbol carried several bits of information.
@_date: 2018-08-29 06:37:29

@_date: 2018-08-28 21:20:21
modems were rated in baud i.e. the raw bitrate which includes overhead such as start and stop bits. Hence the effective datarate (in kilobytes per second) can be estimated to be 1/10 of the baudrate.

Sadly, I didn't get to ask him about his claim of 10^200 "1Counterparty????" addresses when bitcoin version 1 address format only allows for 2^160 possible unique addresses.
But maybe that is just a Bcash improvement I have missed.
@_date: 2018-08-28 09:11:07
Well, generally, cryptography is all about big numbers whether it being large primes or coordinates on an elliptic curve. So at least he knows something. lol.
@_date: 2018-08-27 12:39:11
Except that CSW described addresses with invalid checksum i.e. you cannot actually send any coins to those addresses unless you have a 'broken' wallet that does not validate the checksum of the destination address (i.e. a very basic feature).

HDD seems pretty much intact. Might just happily spin up if plugged into another host.
Assuming it was spinning at the time of the fire, then I wouldn't worry too much about doing more damage by just trying it out as any damage caused by internal melting or sot would have already happened anyway.
HDD recovery could be as simple as moving the platters into a new identical drive - but better left to a professional service doing it in a clean-room :-)
SSD also looks just melted in the plastics. Was it really that one that started the fire? Must have been on the bottom side as the top side of the PCB doesn't really look charred.
More pictures of both devices from all angles and zoomed in as close as possible while maintaining focus would help accessing the possibilities.
If recoverable from the burned house, then the USB stick is definitely also a good asset and would be easier to work with than the SSD. The plastic housing provides excellent ablative fire protection for the actual silicon die. If the memory chips (typically one or two NAND flash chips) are intact, they can be moved to an identical USB stick with ease (for an electronics professional). Should the chips be kind of burned down, the bare silicon might still be working. There are companies that would be able to re-bond the silicon to a new package to allow extracting the content.
(Myself having 20 years experience as an electronics engineering developing these kind of things - currently working with smartphone development)

There was a chart the other day, showing how BTC had 'crashed' by 30-50% about every 3 months since creation, yet we are still at ATH. Surely we'll see a 'crash' soon, but trying to time the crashes i.e. sell at the top and buy back at the lows has left a lot of early investors out on the sideline when they miss the timing and don't want to buy back in on a vastly higher price than they cashed out..
My strategy is to use a fraction of my coins for 'playing the game' while the rest I just HODL til I really need it.

I used coinomi wallet on Android to swipe the same paper wallet twice for BTC and BCH respectively, then transfer it to exchange.
You can argue about the safety as you would be vulnerable to virus/malware on the device. Buy if you keep your shit clean it should be a minor risk.. transferring BTC these days takes some patience though.

Lost about 1K the other day by moving some holdings back and forth between BTC and BCH with bad timing. I'm a hodler but can't seem to agree with myself about how I shall split my funds between the two.

Only used it a few times so far. But works flawless like any other Visa. You keep a BTC wallet at TenX. Whenever you use the card your wallet is debited same amount in BTC instantly. Fees and conversion rates are fair as far as I can judge..

I suppose they also have deals with Changelly and Shapeshift as they redirect you there if you want to swap coins..
Basically, with all the free wallets already available, I don't see how it would ever cost anything - except for e.g. HW wallets or wallets linked to credit cards (oh.. I just got my TenX Visa the other day - working great :-) )

Bought 3x Trezors on black Friday sale - paid with BTC naturally. Payment accepted instantly once visible in mempool, shipped when confirmed on the blockchain. Faster and more convenient than credit card. 
Oh, and for everyday purchases, the TenX Visa works great as a pseudo 2nd layer network bridging the gap to the grocery store.

I had the exact same thought a few months back i.e. putting e.g. CP in the blockchain would render the blockchain illegal.
However, thinking about it, I don't really believe it is a problem.
The blockchain is a huge database, but to extract something like embedded CP you would need specialized tools and you would have to actively search for it. There is no way a normal user would have CP jump out in his face from the blockchain by pure chance.
That's exactly like "the internet". That is also just a huge database containing CP and other stuff, yet it is not in itself illegal in any way. Only if you use specialized tools for accessing the dark web and actively search for it you will be able to extract the illegal content like CP.

Did you recover the burnt Ledger? The silicon which contains your keys is surprisingly sturdy. A specialist might be able to bring it back to life by moving the chips to a fresh Ledger.

For this to be relevant to bitcoin you also need to consider bitcoin is using double hashing i.e. your chances are: impossible squared

You can't remove segwit from the transactions already in the blockchain but I suppose it would be possible to disallow creation of new segwit transactions if there was consensus for doing so. Wouldn't make much sense though.

For most exchanges $10.000 is not a "large sum" as such - unless you mean 10.000 BTC :-)
The main problem is getting validated to a level where you are allowed to play around with those kind of numbers..
Do some research of the top-ranking ones and choose the one you like the most...

Fee per. byte, blocksize and transaction count doesn't say much about the network efficiency now that the world is getting better at using segwith and batching.
Is there a service that shows UTXOs per block or fee per UTXO on both BCH and BTC networks?

I also use kraken (and others). It's my impression they have good security and service. Their traiding platform is somewhat unstable but ok for the casual user.

Those files store all the blocks in the blockchain. They are kept at 128mb max each i.e. each file contain a number of blocks. There are about 140 Gb in total now.

The overall rule is that if you trade with speculation in mind, then it's taxed. No matter whether it's BTC, your house, used cars or paintings.
It's only taxed if your intention is to speculate on the changing market price.

Put the majority in BTC and store then safely.
Use the rest to play around with leveraged altcoin trading (i.e. gambling). When you have lost all of that you will appreciate your BTC even more.

BCH: Look how CZ tried to organize a re-org on BTC to stop a 7000 BTC fraud. LOL. They are so stupid even thinking about this!.
Also BCH: We had a re-org? I didn't know that. Great that they stopped the fraud. This shows just how good BCH centralized management controls our coins!
