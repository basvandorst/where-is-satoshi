sorry.. a bit disappointed over here.. expected.. AMAZON to accept bitcoin.. sry ;P
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:30:26


I don't know if funny or sad..
@_date: 2017-03-09 18:24:27
Maybe you in here spread the propaganda. Ever thought about  this? 
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:42:35
clearly this gets burried in here

If you don't like BU you can be happy about this because you'll be able to buy Bitcoin-Core-Coins for a cheap price!
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:10:23
had to compile
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:24:48
I think it would be quite intuitive to tell people: "Hey, bitcoin split into two chains. You had 1 bitcoin, now you have two. One BTC-c and one BTC-u."
People will be confronted with suddenly having two coins anyway in case of a split.
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:11:02
Yeah right, must be that way because a hf would take years to be ready /s. 
Actually I updated my BU node yesterday, took me about 1 hour to compile and run.
@_date: 2017-03-18 19:50:11
Wow.. took quite some time to get this. That's the whole reasoning behind saying give both chains in case of the fork a neutral name like BTC-c and BTC-u and after some time hand the name Bitcoin to whatever fork has the higher market cap (and thereby the most PoW)
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:15:37
but you cannot prevent that she will have two in case of a fork. I think BTC-u and BTC-c is more intuitive than BTC and BTU with the chance of BTU becoming BTC

some answer from prof. emin 
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:29:27
Haha guys... he's basically saying byebye bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-18 13:15:22
Yaayy.. people stop using bitcoin! Finally!

I'm a bit disappointed by all the "8 mb is clearly to much"-core devs. 
Not because you say that but because you don't give any reasons.
Gavin made a ton of block posts going to every counter argument he saw and discussed them.. Now all the other core devs just say.. its to high.. centralization.. bla.. bla.. but the don't really address gavins arguments.
please explain why 8mb is to high right now?
@_date: 2015-08-21 01:00:14
thanks.. we need more people like you..!
@_date: 2015-08-23 18:12:02
so lets thank jtoomim for his insights as a small miner.. as many of us already thought with recent bandwidth vs. electricity costs its a trade-off worth making.
just staying at 1mb is not rational. why should this number be ideal? just because its the current status quo?
@_date: 2015-08-20 16:58:52
who's spider man?
@_date: 2015-08-18 14:45:41
Thanks for making that clear. But as i understood it, gavin and mike were making compromises. The actual plan was 20mb they cut it down to less than half. 
I personally believe in the limit being not necessary at all if we would just apply a default (with time growing) soft limit and let the economy/miners decide about block sizes.. but that's of course just me, having 0 commits to bitcoin core...
edit: in a game-theoretical aspect i just don't see any big miners bloating the blockchain to benefit themselves.. they will make it more expensive to mine for everyone and while they might survive it they are devaluing their own investment.. if bitcoin becomes too expensive people could switch to other currencies as e.g. lightcoin. in that case the bitcoin miner couldn't even switch as his asics are not builf for that PoW

Please ask yourself who has the most skin in the game? Who depends most on bitcoins success. It's the miners. Especially someone owning a company that produces chips with one purpose.. mining. And now ask yourself whether what Jihan, viabtc &amp; co want can really be bad for bitcoin.
I'm a long time bitcoin believer &amp; enthuisisast. I'm one of the guys who would've totally exited told you 3 years ago about it not being able to stop talking about it. And I believe what Jihan does is exactly right. Nowadays the miners are the only actors who makes sense to me... and actually this is how it was planned by Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-04-08 10:29:15
Alright, let's have an argument. I think lightning is great but forcing it by restricting bitcoins base layer is bad for bitcoin. Especially in times in which bitcoin has to compete with other crypto currencies. Core showed clearly by harming the hong kong agreement (2mb hf for nonwitness data + segwit) that they're not willing to increase on chain capacity any further. That's why a hard fork to increase the block size with an additional malleability fix afterwards is the right path forward IMO.

@_date: 2017-04-19 17:49:34
Ok let's agree they are not totally incompetent coders. 
Still in my opinion they are incompetend leaders and planners for the future of bitcoin. The problem is that everyone wants to see them as such.
@_date: 2017-04-08 16:35:21
2mb would be perfectly fine and by far not reach any physical limitation. Core could unite the community this way. That they're not doing it shows that their unwilling to compromise.
@_date: 2017-04-15 22:51:23
Aye mr. invontor of Bitcoin without inflation control.
@_date: 2017-04-08 10:26:04
yea.. right, mr. Dragon's Den
@_date: 2017-04-11 08:49:08
hum? Not really. He submitted this: 
@_date: 2017-04-08 16:32:51
Core won't do a hard fork afterwards. The hong kong agreement showed that. Otherwise, why shouldn't they just do both at once?
@_date: 2017-04-08 16:41:02


Nope. It states very clearly in the agreement: "[...] including an increase in the **non-witness** data to be around 2 MB[...]"


That's simply not true. Non of the signing miners run classic. What miner on the signatures list are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-04-19 16:35:21
Depends on in what regard incompetend. You can write the most beautiful code in the world but when you get the incentives &amp; economics wrong and are unable to compromise you can drive a $20bn project against the wall. I'd call that incompetent.
@_date: 2017-04-26 11:12:38
Real data is the deadlock bitcoin is in right now
@_date: 2017-04-26 11:14:34
You guys switch your story as it suits you. Sometimes I hear Rogers bitcoin stake vote on which path should be followed BU or Segwit just decided overwhelmingly for BU because Roger voted with all his coins - and sometimes I hear Roger has no bitcoins at all.. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 20:29:06
the letter is so general, what do you imply with these signatures? its just "yea, we did some good work and wanna make bitcoin better" almost everyone working on bitcoin could sign that and still it think you somehow just want to look like you have them all on your side (I'm of course talking to maxwell)
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:18:47
So do it.. go ahead. I'm waiting. For month I just hear brabble about it.
@_date: 2017-05-20 01:08:44
Hey, I was at your bar about 3 years ago on a bitcoin thursday. It was a great evening, you even gave me some drinks for free :). I will come again this year but not yet. I'm posting this under the account of a friend as I'm not allowed to post here anymore. I never cursed or attacked anyone here.. I just stood by my opinion. I hope that at some point we bitcoiners can stand together again..
