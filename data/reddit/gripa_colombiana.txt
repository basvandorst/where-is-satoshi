I use Visa and Master Card for micro-transactions. Works very good; Better than actual cash. 
They give me credit so I only have to make maximum one $ transaction per month to pay them. I work for FIAT so exchanging back and forward doesn't make sense. I only change FIAT to Crypto for savings. 
If I need liquidity I can always sell an asset like a car, my house a TV, Gold coins, or Cryptocurrencies. My No.1 choice is Crypto. Even at $20-30 and hours waiting, is the cheapest, fastest and most convenient way for me. 
If this was a parallel universe in which the only way to pay for things like coffee was with either BTC or BCH and no other way, I will use BCH. 
In the real world, the user experience of every single Crypto is horrendous except in very and I mean very limited outlets and/or situations except as a store of value. Which crypto is the best store of value? Hands down BTC. 
We have a long way to go, and trust me, the final solution will not be 8mb in the oldest Blockchain of all. The google of bitcoin, the tesla of bitcoin, the iPhone of bitcoin is yet to come.
Tell your Boss that the "Im-With-Him" (Roger Ver) campaign with a dozen BCH Social Justice Warriors telling smart people that they are dumb is not a wise shilling strategy. Dont-Be-Evil is a better one.

I admit I was somewhat bugged by the [episode](
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:26:54
I agree 100%. 
It felt good though... "down here salt is a way of life" LOL

I feel a bit bad to be honest. I promised to myself not to contribute in any way to the whole BCash vs Bitcoin conversation. Not when the "spiral of death" was "happening" anyways. 
Im just glad its over.

I hope not. It seems to me that the $7000s are here to stay until the next jump in price. 
In reality I have no clue, Im just biased because Im holding my coins for now. 
Do you know if there is any forum or conversation for Bitoasis people?

Read their subreddit description:
Welcome to Home of free and open bitcoin discussion, bitcoin news, and exclusive AMA (Ask Me Anything) interviews from top bitcoin industry leaders!
Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet. A distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without the need for any central authority whatsoever.
There is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.

$7000 in BitOasis (dubai)
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:39:19
this. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:06:54
Reminded me of Butterfly Labs. Sorry. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:07:13
True. The commissions are very high. I m not sure how they compare to other exchanges, but the fact that they are here in Dubai and I can buy BTC with credit card, etc. Its OK for me for now.
Other than that, I do wish there was a community.
