Are you familiar with how supply and demand works and why everyone selling something at the same time couldn't get the same price because the market would be flooded with sellers looking for non existent buyers. 
If everyone who owned Apple stock decided to sell right now they couldn't all sell for $127 per share because the price would continue to go down as more and more sold.  
Market cap is a shitty metric for measuring btc value anyway.

FDIC was a good idea when banks were small and mostly independent to help confidence and stop ‘runs’ on the bank.  If BOA or Wells ( or both) go under the FDIC on those accounts won’t be worth shit because of how big they have been allowed to become.  Do you think there is some FDIC piggy bank somewhere with billions and billions in it just waiting on a rainy day?  There isn’t.

It's not a simple idea, 'convincing' him it's not friendster is not something that can be done in a couple paragraphs.  
You don't need to know why it is valuable to use it as a means of payment but that is not what was being asked.  
The question is about the value proposition of btc and why it will( or may) continue to thrive going forward.   
I'm not here to sell anything and don't care if OP gets it or not.  If you've figured out the perfect pitch to condense this rabbit hole into a paragraph  let's hear it.

I just did the same thing at a Sushi place last week because it was the first time I was ever at a physical location that accepted btc near me and I've been waiting years for the opportunity.  
I go to this restaurant at least monthly and for the first time, they had a btc accepted sign posted on the door.
I knew it was going to be expensive (cost me around $15 to pay a $50 bill) and slow ( later confirmed in a few hours) but I wanted to do it anyway.  
I was their first transaction, they had been signed up with Bitpay and they didn't know what they were doing (as expected).  
When the transaction didn't register on their end after a few mins I gave them my phone number so they were comfortable with me leaving and told them they could call me but the transaction was sent and not reversible.
I received a call the next day as I guess the owner was expecting to receive btc in their wallet that never showed up.  I had to explain how their payment provider converted it to cash and they should contact them.  I emailed them my proof of payment and that was the end of it.
Felt like using early dial-up modems, expensive and slow but it's early days and things will continue to progress.  I was glad to do it but for now, it will be the last time until a second layer solution is up and running.
@_date: 2015-12-12 14:19:36

Well firstly hat would put the value of one bitcoin at $100,000,000.00 while not impossible, even I'm not that bullish.
But even then bits represent 6 decimal places and they are ignoring the last 2, it would be pretty easy to add additional decimal places and cut the bitcoin up further.  I guess you would have to name it something like mini bits, nano bits or fucking bacon bits for all I care.  Doesn't matter, it's a non issue.

I started buying in the high $500s up to the $900s and still buying all the way back down to current levels.  I buy twice a month every month. I estimate my cost average is in the mid $700s.  I am in for the long haul of 5-10 years and if it all evaporated tomorrow I would be disappointed but by no means financially destitute.  In my mind this is really the only approach unless you are a seasoned trader. As long as the protocol isn't broke, I'm not concerned with the day to day price swings.  Today's value has very little influence on the value in 5 years so I view it as an discount opportunity. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 16:59:55
This couldn't happen in this fashion with bitcoin.  It is literally impossible.

Price equates with use of bitcoin.  This was his baby, that he worked on tirelessly for years, he cares because it means the success of an idea.

If this is the way you want to do it I would recommend you save your wallet to the flash and also print out the private key using the debug console(google it).  That way if the file corrupts you haven't lost access toall of your money.  Only when you have done both of these things can you go to your roaming/bitcoin folder on your computer and delete the wallet file there.  Next time you want use the wallet file you drag it back from flash disk to the roaming/bitcoin folder on your pc and then start up the bitcoin qt. Your money will be right back, you could also just import the private key in the qt debug console and it would do the same thing.  Might sound complicated but it is easy once you have done it a couple of times.

Your friend isn't that smart apparently because if electricity goes down guns will be worth more than gold.  We are talking widespread starvation, looting, murder and overall decay of society. 
When this pops off you can't eat gold, you can't burn it for warmth and you can't protect yourself with it.
If electricity goes down on a global scale we will see some serious end of days shit.  Gold will only be useful again once the survivors begin to rebuild society and need an analog ledger to track debts.(golds oldest use case)

I made a similar investment and  I highly recommend Armory.  Additionally I would use an old laptop or cheap netbook that will never go online to setup an offline Armory wallet.  Then on your regular online computer you setup Armory watch only wallet. This is adds an extra step of using a USB to sign/broadcast  transactions between  computers but your security would be pretty close to bullet proof. Once you do it a couple times it really isn't any big deal and with $20k there's no such thing as too careful.

I've done what you are considering with about 1/3 of my 401k.
Thinks to consider:
1.) Your current age and how long until you need the money
2.) If you do a straight withdrawal you will pay close to 40% tax to IRS.
3.) You could take a loan out against up to 50% of your balance and pay it back directly out of your paycheck using a repayment schedule of your choosing(max usually 72 mos).
Taking the loan allows you to avoid paying any tax as long as you repay it in full.  If you leave your job you must repay it in full or pay the aforementioned tax on the outstanding balance.   Additionally you pay yourself back with interest so it isn't a bad way to do it if you accept the risk involved.
Until there is an investment vehicle to buy directly with your 401k, this is the only way I found to do it.

I don' think they can diverge from each other great distances or for extended periods of time.   If the price cratered and sustained that level for a length of time miners would drop out and the hash rate would come down.  Also if the price started soaring for an extended period of time new mining power would be added at elevated rates compared to a time when price was more static.

Well you are being a little more ridiculous about it.  He is talking about them participating in an established community event that takes place once a year.  It could drive both awareness of btc and awareness of Overstock to people that would not otherwise shop there.  Ideally some "laymen" would see save an extra 5% or 10% when you pay with bitcoin as they were checking out. Now they wouldn't hold off on their purchase just to go get btc but it would offer a "point of contact" in which they are directly presented with the term bitcoin which could assist in driving consumer education.  Personally I don't give a shit if they do it or not, but I don't think it is a big deal to put it out there.

They wouldn't give up the opportunity willingly but if the citizens start to prefer bitcoin (or whatever crypto wins) then the national fiat currency will suffer deflation from lack of demand.

The interesting part will be if/when bitcoin does grow like most people expect; it will lead to people financing in fiat if interest rates are below grow levels that can be achieved holding bitcoin as a store of value.  If bitcoin were 10,000.00 tomorrow and i though it would go to 100,000.00 in another 5 years, I wouldn't sell any of my bitcoin holding to pay off my mortgage because the fiat interest rate is only 3.5% APR.  Same will probably go for car loans, credit cards etc as they would all provide arbitrage opportunities.  I am very interested as to the effect this would have on national currencies but my inclination is that it would be pretty negative for said currencies over the long term. Edit - Point clarification is that I would always prefer to finance rather than be a btc cash buyer for those big ticket items because of growth opportunities.  Once btc growth is saturated, this phenomenon would most likely end.

How many of the people in the article have the ability to move hundreds of millions of dollars in a few seconds if coerced?  I bet none, all would have to involve a multi day home invasion or kidnapping, bank transfer over the course of days.  Any bank wire for hundreds of millions would probably involve some in person paperwork and it would be going to a known bank account.  You can view it as a necessary danger that comes with what bitcoin can do but if true, it's the perfect target to go after compared to everyone else on the list.

I think you are missing the point, even though you have probably heard it often, which is NOT storing btc in ANY exchange.  Hold them yourself, trade when you need to and get back out.  Don't trust any third party to hold YOUR money for you - that is the point.  I feel sorry for any btc newcomer who just searched btc exchange and landed at GOX a week or two before shit went south.  Those types of people didn't do enough research and got unlucky but how many really fit that description, probably not many.

Why is deflation an issue?  Historically the only deflation we have seen is due to lack of demand for a national currency.  This "deflation" is really a death spiral driven by lack of faith in the aforementioned fiat currency.  We have yet to see a deflationary currency that was deflating as it grew more popular due to a hard issuance limit.  BTC is truly in uncharted territory on a number of fronts and will be very interesting to watch as it evolves.  Deflation because no one wants/trusts the currency is definitely bad - Deflation because everyone wants it and supply is very limited (I say not bad) but we will see soon enough.

The idea of digital currency has a pretty high mental barrier to entry point. Initially it just seems like there is no way it could work until you invest the time to educate yourself.

The invention was the first decentralized distributive network that is capable of coming to an agreed state of consensus(every 10 mins). The problem solved was the double spend.  All digital money up to the invention of bitcoin was able to be copied endlessly or required a central authority to handle the debit/credits to stop digital copying.

I think you're expecting too much too soon.  Pretty much every issue you raise can and well be addressed as the ecosystem is built out.  We are still in the "wild west" of bitcoin right now and the bitcoin of 2024 will be much improved over the bitcoin of today.(Assuming we do in fact get there and if btc doesn't some other crypto surely will)

This is definitely what a first timer hears even when it is explained in a completely concise and articulate way.  I am convinced that people are just not capable of wrapping their minds around it the first time around.( I count myself in this group) It's like talking about space-time and relativity.  Some things take a lot of explaining and thinking about before the idea sticks.  I suspect down the line people will just use it because it became ubiquitous and offers some advantages without them necessarily knowing or caring how it works.

Yea and if I had loaned 1 btc back when it was pegged to 1200 and person who borrowed that one btc could now pay it back with interest for under $700 today.  The point is by lending your btc (or borrowing) out on a USD linked loan you are essentially putting in a short on the btc price.  If the BTC price goes down you will receive more btc back in the way of payments.   However if the btc/usd price goes up you may receive back less btc then you originally lent out.

Not to be a dick but it was your fault you lost that money. You should have kept control of your coins but instead you choose the convenience of trusting a third party with them.  This goes against pretty much the whole idea of bitcoin.  If you had put forth effort to run your own cold storage or at least have blockchain.info wallet, you would still have your money today.  Everyone who kept money there for any longer than it takes to trade made a choice and needs to take some personal responsibility.  I'm sorry for your loss but you put yourself in that position, nobody else and certainly not bitcoin.

I read the article and it is very circumstantial.  I find it hard to believe that someone, who everyone agreed is obsessed with privacy, would have used their real name in the btc forum during the creation of bitcoin.  Satoshi wasn't dumb, so either 1.) he wanted to be found or 2.) they have the wrong guy.  Either way it didn't stop them from showing this guys face, his home, his car and saying hey he probably has access to $400,000,000.00 or so.

Just like a thousand other people have said, merchant adoption out pacing user adoption because of merchant perceived benefits. This should lead to a positive merchant feedback loop which will suppress the price for a while.  Possibly this will persist until block halving but eventually the price will start to rise consistently which will start the consumer feedback loop to push the price up.  It's basically a childrens see saw and the merchants are the fat kid sitting opposite a toddler.  I don't expect it to change in the next 6 months or so either but if we can stay on track long enough it will.

My understanding is that if blockchain got hacked your coins could be stolen because only one key is required to move them and this isn't possible with Bitgo as you need two signatures. 
Not sure how it works if block chain were to disappear but you can recover your coins from bitgo if they went under. You use the hard copy back up containing 2 of 3 encrypted keys with software on github. 
Bitgo also offers a setting to whitelist addresses so your Bitcoin can only be withdrawn to pre approved addresses if you want.   I just started messing with it recently as I was using Armory up to this point.

Why didn't the SEC reject it 1, 2, 3 years ago?  2014 would have been a fine year to reject it and write it off due to Mt Gox and other issues as too immature(dangerous) for the average investor as an ETF.
Instead they wait until bitcoin is the most mature it has ever been to shoot down approval at the last extension, knowing there are more ETFs on the horizon?  It just doesn't make sense.
I can't help but feel optimistic that it is going to get approved.

It's a cool idea and I tried it out a couple years back but the execution is terrible.   
For one btcjam takes their cut right off the top so they still collect full commission from the scam loans and defaults instead of getting a portion of each loan payment.  
This,of course, is not by accident as they know the default rates even though they try to down play them. 
Their arbitration process is a toothless joke and basically serves no purpose.

Buying that amount through Coinbase should be fine, their fees can be a bit much but at least you are comfortable with it.  
If you are going to put in that kind of money, buy and learn to use a hardware wallet.   Don't trust any third parties to hold your bitcoin for you.

The idea behind it is that by buying btc you are buying a piece of the Bitcoin network.

Just wondering how signalling works...  Is it possible for a well funded party to potentially stop a 95% consensus vote just by maintaining control of over 5% of the hash power on average over the course of the year.  
Assuming yes and if the 95% requirement continued to be the trigger moving forward over the next few years for any and all upgrades; would that allow said entity to veto any and all upgrades provided they can pay the cost it takes to maintain over 5% hash rate.
Obviously maintaining over 5% is no small task for sure but seems more plausible and more effective than a 51% attack.  What am I missing?

The IRS will go for the low hanging fruit first.  They want to see all btc sells(over a certain threshold) that resulted in fiat withdrawals to bank accts.  
Once they have identified these individual accounts they will check to see if those people showed any btc gains or losses during those corresponding years .

I think there is some truth to the statement that you have to be ready to really "get it".  I first heard about bitcoin in 2011 and dismissed it; I just wasn't ready to learn the lessons necessary to truly appreciate it.  
It took two more years of causal exposure to it before one day it finally clicked.  At that point, not only did I finally get it but my entire outlook on my personal finances changed forever with it.
2014 and most of 2015 were definitely challenging times to remain dedicated to my cost averaging plan but coming out on the other side I can't help but take some pride in it.
I know some quit along the way, hell I know I questioned myself at times, after taking massive losses but we keep moving forward.

I bet when btc is worth 6 figures you can get a loan against it from a bank and post it as collateral.   This gives you cash to invest while you maintain ownership of the appreciating asset all without triggering a taxable event.
This would work really well for someone with a fair amount of coins that would just be sitting anyway.  I suspect this will be an advantageous way to use your btc to invest in other things. 
Then you use your newly generated revenue streams to pay off the loan over time and free up the btc as needed.

Users, merchants and other miners not sharing the 2X vision coupled with the current poor 2X developer base.   Most hodlers will probably dump the 2X coins for BTC like with bcash which may buoy the btc price making it more profitable to mine.  Miners have already proven most will choose to mine the most profitable chain.
 In the end, I think that chain will ultimately be the current BTC chain.  A couple more mining pools need to peel off the 2X heard and then the whole thing will fall apart.   What else can you do? You can't stop them from forking off..just strap in and you'll probably be ok.

I spent a year on BTCJam and the platform is broken in my experience.  BTCJam takes their cut up front from the borrower and as a result they get paid even if you don't.
They are basically running a sausage factory at this point.  New lenders come(lose capital), new borrowers come in(take away the capital) rinse repeat and take a cut every time.
You can make money if you guess right but there are **a lot** of scammers or people that run at the first sign of adversity.  When these loans can touch real life credit (at least in the developed world) then it might work better.

Here's the thing though.  If Mark knew the exchange was insolvent he should have been using Willy to drive down the price to decrease his fiat liability when people cashed out. 
Once the price is low enough he could begin buying panic sold coins and stabilize price at higher level down the line erasing a good portion of his debts. 
Driving up the price like that out of the gate (if that happened) only exacerbated the insolvency issue and led to that spectacular collapse.

Not really a good example as you make no consideration for risk vs reward or risk tolerance.
Your example is 52.6% risk for a 100% payoff.  
Bitcoin is probably more risk but the pay out if successful is measured in hundreds of thousands of percent.

Conventional wisdom says it's usually best to buy low and then sell high.
@_date: 2015-10-14 20:40:40
I don't really see the benefit at this point because in terms of fiat they are less convenient than traditional banks.  I say that because you can't spend USD out of Coinbase/Circle..etc with converting to btc.  
If they go on to issue debit cards or NFC payments for fiat then maybe...

It doesn't feel like 2013 yet, there was a palpable feeling of hysteria when things were in full swing.
I think those that have been in for 3 years + are pretty hardened by now and not likely to fold easily.  We have a while to go..

That would become less of an issue if bitcoin acceptance were widespread.
@_date: 2017-07-10 17:46:08
Why are they including people who bought $20k? They should only be looking for people who sold that amount or more for fiat and may have 'forgot' to claim it.
@_date: 2015-10-06 16:14:08
Great wallet, thanks.

Will probably prove to be a conservative guess.
I think we can hit that mark in 2024, maybe a little sooner.

Nice move.
@_date: 2016-05-20 21:04:47
Yup - yesterday and today.
There are a few people in the support forum complaining of the issue.  Support said they would refund whatever was taken but it's still a pain in the ass.  
They took over $200 out of my account so far, called my bank to try and lock them out until this gets figured out.  Bank said sure that will take effect in 1-2 business days which doesn't really help.

You have to figure most of these share holders paid a good deal more per share than current market rates.  I doubt many will sell for a loss, so you could see this get bid up until sellers are interested.  What is the plan for second market to buy additional btc and add shares to bring in new investors as this would help the price.
@_date: 2016-07-18 14:15:35
Yes and I wasn't very good at savings accounts before bitcoin.  I would get up to a grand and then find something to spend it all on and start over.  Not so with btc.

Are you going for the get some fast money now to blow or I got F U money?
Next year you'll probably only be sort of rich (probably not even that) but if you were to hang in there for 6-8 years, you could potentially be set for life.

I think it is as risky as putting your money in the stock market for the next 15 years.  You can have losses anywhere, I don't expect either to go to 0.

That sucks - probably not the best idea to be storing btc on a jail broken device anyway as you are opening your phone up to certain security issues.   
Just FYI.

I'll sell you one on Feb 7th 2020 for the spot price of $25,000 if you're still buying then.

I do and feel it is secure.  I have multiple nanos hooked to the same 24 word seed that I store securely.  
I even gave one of my nanos to a family member to throw in their safe as a back up. I figure even if it somehow gets stolen there isn't much anyone can do with it. You have 3 guesses to get the 4 digit pin and then the device wipes itself.  
Even if you were to guess correctly you still need to defeat the 2 factor challenge to move money. Honestly I'm more concerned about keeping my 24 word seed safe and accessible.
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:29:11

People across the globe make up the bitcoin market. The average person doesn't even know what bitcoin is or why it is going to be important.  So how could people all factor in a halving that presently they never heard of or don't understand?
I always found this argument ridiculous.

Sounds like you thought of a few.
People in developing countries may go on use it as their first bank account eventually.  
Some others: Remittances, avoiding currency controls and currency devaluation, ability to conduct e-commerce for the first time because there was no access to credit card networks. 
It will also eventually provide tax havens that are better and more secure than current off shore options.
Internet of things may finally take off an use it.
Ability to have digital representations of physical assets and whatever that goes on to enable.
These are just a few off the top of my head no to mention all the stuff we can't think of today that will be invented in the next 10-20 years.

Moot point as Bitcoin can currently be divided into 100,000,000 pieces and more in the future if needed.  Price would just keep going up and we would move  to smaller units sub Satoshis.  
@_date: 2016-07-20 21:02:31
What is the difference exactly? 
Are investments guaranteed to perform a certain way that is inherently less risky than a speculative asset?  
Would you consider Enron stock in 1999 or Lehman Bros shares in 2006 an investment or speculative play?

The Great bear market as it will come to be known was 2014 into 2015 and it was 18 months of never ending bad news, cheap coins, hacks, tulips, beanie babies, ponzi scheme, neobee, havelock investments, Gox meltdown, China bans bitcoin, Apple bans bitcoin, China bans bitcoin again, prof bitcorn, rise of the alts, two more weeks, cloud mining, bit license, bear whale, buttcoin, more even cheaper coins, we found Satoshi, bitcoin is dead never-ending  bullshit.   
Not gonna lie, it became hard to buy week in and week out as the price just seemed to sink lower and lower and lower. 
At my lowest times I always came back to the underlying tech and the fact that it worked and was working as designed, without fail and that kept me going.   As I lack any meaningful technical skills to help bitcoin I figured my contribution would be to support it by injecting fiat in as often as I could.  
Looking back on it, it was very challenging  but  I am glad I went through it as it provided tremendous learning experience and really strengthened my resolve to see this thing through. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 15:43:56

Incorrect, there are 100,000,000 satoshis in a bitcoin making a satoshis worth .01 USD each in that scenario.  
There are 1,000,000 bits in a bitcoin, maybe you are thinking of that.
