We will find out next week, hope for the best. I'm pretty sure they have the means to back that price.

Well this is reddit for you, their way or the highway.

Well Zens have lost a lot of value, so your best bet for getting as much as you can asap is:
1. Keep mining hashpoints and try to convert your zens into the 6-month hashstakers and sell them at ~$17.
2. Take option 2 and turn your Prime into a Prime Hashstaker, you will get a free paycoin for upgrading. Then sell everything.
7 6-hashtakers: $119
Prime + 1 paycoin : at least $70
And there, you've made your ROI, not counting hashpoints mined during this time period. That's if GAW comes 
through, if not, tough luck.
This is your best bet, good luck.

Of course is going to call it a scam, they've gotten burned too much on previous scams and are too jaded to think differently. You'll just get downvotes and ponzi/scam accusations here. Just mentioning Paycoin got you downvotes.

I think a vastly better way would be to say that a 800 TH/s operation would have represented 200% of the network, but today represents 0.4%.

Could you give us a few hints?  It seems like no one's getting the last ones, me included.

With any luck, $150 was the bottom
