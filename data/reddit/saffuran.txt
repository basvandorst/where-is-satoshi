I don't mind paying taxes at all but in the USA the IRS currently subjects Cryptocurrencies to multiple forms of taxation.
It is treated as property and taxed as such passively, this will likely also apply to state level property taxes. Then at the point of sale, cryptocurrencies are taxed as Capital Gains (as you realize their value through transaction) and you also pay sales tax on whatever you buy.

Well there is sales tax but not on the currency, you just pay a sales tax for buying things in general. But that's interesting, I don't know why it is treated as "property" in that case but that was the understanding I had come to prior based on what the IRS had said, but if it's only Cap Gains, that's not too awful.

Right now it's just the issue of dealing with property taxation on crypto holdings (state and fed, essentially) which erodes holdings, and then to also deal with immediate capital gains taxation as well as standard sales tax at the point of sale, it's an asinine way to handle cryptocurrencies from that front and why I was wondering if it is even constitutional for the IRS to treat it that way based on monetary rulings established by the Supreme Court.

I'm not trying to avoid taxes I think that Cryptocurrencies are *oppressively* taxed. Property taxes on any you hold, and Capital Gains (at the point of sale) as well as Sales Tax (on what you buy) as a result of transactions.
They essentially hit Cryptos hard in every facet as of right now.
