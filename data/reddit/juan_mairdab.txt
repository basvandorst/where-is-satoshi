The only reason this guy is relevant is because Leonardo Dicaprio played him in a movie. I had personally never heard of him before it was released.

You have what are known as “weak hands” buddy.   Probably better for you to sell them all as you clearly don’t have the stomach for bitcoins erratic price swings.

Buying the dips is how this should be done,  Did you jump in at an ath?

Beware of bitcoin.com, the site is owned by Rodger ver. He is the person who hard forked the network.

No worries brother, their lack of understanding is comical to a Hodler

You are the type of person who will buy at 17k and panic sell at 12k 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:02:17

You will be on here with your “I sold at 15 and could have had 100k”  or whatever stories.   e2a  14.4k on Coinbase now buddy. Almost at your cash out level. If I were you I would keep a little

Taxing is what they will do. I’ve lost count of the amount of times I’ve read a “bitcoin banned” by x country news article. Bitcoin is going mainstream. Futures trading will only accelerate this
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:51:36
 not enough 
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:29:43
You would have probably asked that my at 1000 dollars also 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:52:50
You shouldn’t have bought bitcoin at all. You clearly have no appetite for this volatile environment. People like you will only loose money. You get caught up with the hype. Prob bought at or close to ath now you will most likely sell at a loss 
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:30:27
Trezor definitely accepts bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:06:00

What do you mean with “desperation of the poster” ?  Curious choice of words. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 10:43:24
That’s why it says Glasgrow taxi DRIVERS accepting bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-26 11:33:03
We are due a pullback, don’t be surprised if the price suddenly drops by 1000 bucks or more. Some big hodlers are sure to cash out at these levels. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:01:56
So you are looking at this purely as a way to make some Fiat? I will be spending my bitcoin

How much crypto do u own? None I’m guessing, probably never had any.  Just coming on here to gloat at people who lost money is not cool. 
Edit to add I bought in 2013 and I haven’t sold any so I haven’t lost anything.

most people here will know all of this
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:42:02
Are bitcoin advisors actually a thing? If they do I wouldn’t trust them anyway. No doubt they would get a cut of any profits and will want paid if the bitcoin price goes down. You will get better advice from people who actually know about bitcoin right here, and no charge.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:16:10
Just think how shitty they feel when the price is going up and they have no coins. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 23:15:23
People always say they would buy if the price dropped to X but in reality they won’t. It takes real balls to buy when the price is in free fall.
