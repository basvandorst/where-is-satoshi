So there's two things here:
They are a web wallet for their customers, where the customers are not in full control. They rely on the exchange to move funds.
The exchange is a full client to themselves because they keep a copy of each blockchain for their purposes. But this doesn't help customers with control/etc it's for the exchange to process deposits and withdrawals with confidence.

No direct pay - anyone can contribute it is open source. Being a core developer has its perks though -  industry companies will pay you to advise them / answer their questions. Some conferences will fly you around the world to have you.

Cool! Thanks for the explanation. I like the if/else logic too that's very flexible.

I think I should have the option to upgrade from classic to buy mode if I'm getting frustrated with the speed. Doesn't need to be automatic, just a click or two.
I think sell mode should be implicit once I enable it. EG When I'm 50% of the way done I have 50% I can be selling.
User experience in my view:
When I start a torrent, I'd start each one without paying, and offering to sell at my default rate. If I wanted to, I could increase the sell rate or say I don't want to sell. I could also offer to pay at this point but would usually leave $0.00.
Then if my torrent is slow or I wanted to stream effectively, I'd start paying.

They don't like dealing with people who can't use their credit cards properly either. It's the customers responsibility to understand their payment method and this isn't a complicated thing. I bet no consumer wallets will even have rbf as an option. breadwallet won't, Aaron likes simplicity.

Simply require one confirmation if rbf is on. It's not an innocent thing to turn it on (and I really doubt any wallet will force it on every transaction with no settings option). If the customer wants the convenience of not waiting, they must play nice.

Hey! And welcome!
Bitcoin storage depends on the amount. For amounts you might keep in your wallet a cell phone wallet properly backed up is just fine. For more than a few hundred you'll want to look into hardware wallet or paper wallet solutions. These wallets aren't good for everyday spending, and are "offline".
Mining is not the best bet for a beginner. Just buy Bitcoin outright.

Trump is planning to simplify the tax code significantly, but deciding if Bitcoin is an asset or a currency is going to be a tricky one, because it's both at once. 
With traditional assets, each transaction could contribute to your taxable gains. With traditional currency, well, that stuff always depreciates, so it's conveniently exempt from per transaction gains.

I believe there is an issue with Quantum computing. 
So a quantum computer shouldn't be able to go Address -&gt; Public Key -&gt; Private Key, but a quantum computer could go Public Key -&gt; Private Key.
So if you expose your Public Key or an Xpubkey from an HD wallet, and quantum becomes a thing, might be at risk.

Honestly sounds like a police matter, file a police report in Brantford where they're from.
Also I do believe they sent multiple emails and many posts on reddit and in this space while they were shutting down and said "we aren't a bank, we're not holding your money forever so you can just come get it when you want, take your money while you can..." And you didnt.

It does - but it doesn't have the UI to "edit" transactions you've sent but are still unconfirmed. I'm not sure if it visually flags incoming transactions that have RBF enabled.

Pretty much all. Someone who's used to trusting unconfirmed transactions from "friends" could get burned. Unconfirmed transactions can now be fully editable if enabled.

You'd probably know because you'd be getting charged fees for extra accounts and features visible in your online banking. This happened because of the incentive bonus to employees if they opened new features for existing customers.

I can't help you with your problem but for closure, voice calls are susceptible to malicious call forwarding, while text messages generally are not. 
Someone could call your carrier late night, convince them to add forwarding, and you'd never even know it until you eventually realize you aren't getting calls.

Yes, however if you reuse the same addresses for long periods of time it degrades performance and eventually requires you to reload the seed.

Honestly, Satoshi invented a massively significant technology of our time. It's an honour to be named after him. Ignore the people here who think it's corny.
The only issue I'd see is, today, a satoshi is also the smallest unit of Bitcoin, synonymous with a cent/penny.

Their financials allocated 1.8M in costs before the pre-sale. How did they spend 1.8M before getting any money? Wonder if execs over-billed hours, events etc... I remember seeing excessive sponsorships etc. then they got a clean 1.8 right away.
Also they have allocated ~10M for development and it's almost been a year - what progress has been made with this 10M?
I don't need Etheruem to succeed or be the end all, but I'd like them to make a contribution...

Trump has been pretty clear he can use elements of the patriot act to require money exchangers to ask for proof of citizenship. So once in Bitcoin, you're right, but exchanging into Bitcoin would be the crime for illegal immigrants. Circle, Coinbase etc would be affected.

Do you have an iPhone? Download breadwallet, it will generate a 12 word seed which stores your Bitcoin. Save that 12 word sentence (as if it's the money) on a piece of paper. Once inside the app, it will give you a Bitcoin address to receive the Bitcoin. Do a withdrawal on the betting site to that Bitcoin address.
For extra security, "wipe" the breadwallet app from within settings to delete it contents, then delete the app off your phone. Keep that 12 word seed for a while and smile.
Don't use your computer to do this, it could steal your coin. By moving the Bitcoin to a 12 word seed (12 word sentence) on a relatively secure device, and then keeping a paper copy (or two), you are in totally control of the Bitcoin like you would be with cash.

That's a great idea, but who gets final say? Unfortunately, it's very hard to measure intent. With Bitcoin transactions, you don't need intent, you need keys. Since the intent is not known, all transactions are assumed to be final.
You can build a software chargeback layer on top of Bitcoin, called escrow etc.

I disagree - Bitcoin is not the source of the funds, it's the medium you're using for transfer. If you transferred the money all in one day and had records, you'd show them the proof of the money in Brazil, where it came from.
I agree that using Bitcoin does not absolve you of your tax obligations to Brazil. Make your own choices.

Keeping them in Circle is marginally better than a betting site, but still with a third party. Eg Circle has a 12 word seed for you, and you come to them with a login.
When you install breadwallet, you click new wallet. You'll notice there's also restore wallet. Ready for a mind blowing? Just type in your 12 word seed in the restore section, on any iPhone anywhere in the world, and that iPhone gets all your Bitcoins back. 
You'd then send a few coins to, say Circle or your favourite exchanger, and "wipe" the wallet from the iPhone again.
Anytime you want to access your Bitcoin you use your 12 word seed, where the rest of your coins await. Don't use it too often as each time is a risk. 
Feel free to start a new seed as needed. I just wish breadwallet would let you have multiple seeds going...
