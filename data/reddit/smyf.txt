Do you think so? I'm guessing all of their gaming transactions occur internally on their own networks, which would not incur transaction fees.

You're going to make 9% on each sale. So offering a larger discount like 15% will attract customers to using bitcoin. In the long term they may become repeat customers and the reduced profit in the shortrun will be replaced by greater long term margins.

The reason I chose his Nobel title was to introduce him to those who may not be familiar with his work. Many may not know him, but know the Nobel prize, and therefore may be more inclined to pay heed to this link and go on to discover more of his incredible work.
@_date: 2014-10-14 15:41:28
Perhaps it was a poor way to introduce him. In fact it seems that I, like the bank, was trying to use the credibility of the Nobel name in order to garner attention for my own personal ends.

The inherent usefulness for any kind of transaction is what is driving the currency-side adoption. Why wouldn't any business start to transact in BTC?

Will this game have an API to allow 3rd parties to develop sites relating to the game?
This could be used for leaderboards and track player stats. I'm asking this because I've worked on a number of community stats-based sites, some with over 250,000 members. These types of sites/apps can add tremendously to a player's value of the game.

I've been using Bitstamp for over 2 years now. It's a bit of a pain to get set up but even with their fees it's much cheaper than using localbitcoins for example. However localbitcoins is a quicker process as you'll find sellers accepting U.K. Bank transfers.

Why do you think this relatively low drop would drive Bitcoin adoption in the UK? The 20% drop in the months after the vote didn't result in any more stores accepting payment.
@_date: 2016-11-21 23:51:49
In this instance it is. Making the market simpler for customers is a driving factor in adoption. 
If I was buying a loaf of bread I don't want to have to compare the cost of the flour, the baker's time and the fuel the lorry used to get it to the store. Simplicity moves markets.

This is good for Bitcoin, yet they are demanding a source.

@_date: 2016-11-21 19:30:36
That's exactly the point. Customers wouldn't know they're paying it so they wouldn't be put off by surprise fees.

Not answering your question, but on the topic.
I bet on the UK referendum and the US election and got great odds (the best, truly great odds, amazing).
I would be very surprised after the US result if bookies don't shorten the odds on elections across the board. It's clear that there internal analysis (like most establishment organisations) is way off.

Britain is not in the Euro, however it is a part of the EU. If we decide to leave it probably won't have that much effect on the euro short term. However if it catalyses other countries (i.e. Holland) to leave, the entire European project will likely be evaluated.

Atomic swaps do not create or destroy coins.
They allow people to trade coins directly without an intermediary exchange facilitating the deal.
If you have litecoin and I have Bitcoin we can arrange a swap between us using our wallets rather than going to Poloniex.com or some other exchange.
One effect of this may be to push down exchange fees as users move to direct trades to facilitate deals. However it's likely that exchanges will still be useful as they offer a wide range of trading options and tools which may take a long time to be developed via atomic swaps.
@_date: 2016-12-28 16:05:17
If you have their public Bitcoin address then you can send them some bits. That's all you need. However as the transaction is on chain then you will pay a transaction fee.
@_date: 2016-11-14 11:24:08
That's not correct. By definition the bookies want the favourite to win. 'Favourite' is shorthand for 'bookies favourite'.
They stack the odds so that people are encouraged to bet on unlikely outcomes because they are unlikely to occur.
That's why it was an upset to the bookies when Leicester won the league, they offered insane odds so that people bet on them. When it happened the total earnings on either side of that bet didn't match the payout.

You could move some Bitcoin to a new wallet that you control, then give them the keys to it. You should advise them to transfer the Bitcoin to a wallet of their own creation afterwards.
@_date: 2016-11-21 11:24:20
I agree. It's an issue of perception.
A while back eBay forced sellers to set postage as free on certain items (CDs/DVDs etc). This shifted the focus of cost from buyer to seller. Sure the seller may have increased the sale price to factor in postage, but all the buyer sees is a cost with no additional charges.
@_date: 2016-11-21 11:20:18
I don't think the seller needs to care about the Bitcoin network at all. All they would need to care about is making more money.
The incentive for the seller to pay the fees would be an increase in sales, therefore an increase in revenue to them.
Furthermore, if the seller could see on their end that the transaction fee in BTC was consistently less than other Payment types (PayPal/Stripe) this may encourage them to promote Bitcoin payments over alternatives which may lead to increased usage of the Bitcoin ecosystem.
@_date: 2016-11-21 11:34:12
I don't see how this is affected by the change I suggested.
Either way the buyer pays (price+fee) for a product, only with this change the fee is priced into the selling price.
@_date: 2015-08-12 15:33:39
