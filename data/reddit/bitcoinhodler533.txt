Well, now that the price reached my prediction I hope you wished you did not flag my warning
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:51:46
Do you "trust" me now?
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:53:39
Look at you now, little fry guy...
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:39:52
You are an idiot, and a poor one at that
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:22:39
Haha sure, show me your wallet you little man
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:39:56
I can't be certain, but if the media coverage is bad, yes 10k is possible, 12k more likely. Just think of all the newcomers buying in at 15k just to see it drop to 12k, who knows what might happen on such low volumes...The volume was 15000BTC last night on GDAX, the price went up 10% on just a few BTC Imagine how bad it can fall on these volumes if these guys dump a couple of hundred BTC all at once.
But we will wait and see, we can come back to my post in about a week time.

I am warning people, not supporting it. Look at the daily thrrad, peopleare asking how to get their "free money b2x", every other comment is asking about it. This is a hige scam and I am warning people about it. It shouldn't be deleted but upvoted!
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:41:32
This is a scam. Has nothing to do with the November fork that was cancelled. This is a classic campaign pump and dump happening to bump the price.
I wrote about it anfew posts below, but got downvotes to oblivion from the fomo folks. Don't get fooled like they did.
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:55:02
Yes, exactly my thought.  It's not even a 3 people team, at least 2 accounts are fake. This is a scam, but just read on the main daily post  how many people it fooled into thinking this is a real fork. Prople are buying btc just to hold for the "free money". Just read the daily, every second post is about this "fork" asking how to get the money
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:02:28
Just buy in now, big guy, let's catch up in a few days to tell me how much money you made. Conspiracy theory, hah. Yeah, you've seen too few of those pump and dumps, my friend
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:08:48
Nope, it's not. It's a pump and dump campaign. They premined 2million coins and they are paying all those websites to push it. Google Segwit2X and have a look at their "website", their "team", how many campaigns they are running, ex: admob, merkle.com, they are at least upfront with the fact they were payed for, but most other websites just cash in to pump this fraud.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:49:22
Guys, this is a pump and dump scheme called Segwit2X or B2X. The price will fall soon due to the dump, check here my thoughts on what is happening now
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:29:02
No idea why it got removed.
Redditor for almost 3 years, and in forex and crypto since 2015, but not posting from my main on Bitcoin and never did.
You are free to believe anything you like, but this is as a classic pump and dump as they come
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:48:41
Which part of" this is a scam" did you not understand. There is no such fork...
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:33:32
And if you actually have a look at the pumps, they occurred at exactly the same time on 26th and today. In the wee hours between trade zones with the exact same volume.
I am trying to warn you guys, but nobody is listening. Oh well
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:52:21
There is no fork, this is just a scam,how often do you want to hear me say it. This is just random people trying to dump bitcoin on the masses.
I am not scaring anyone, I am stating the obvious. A fake russian model without a linked in profile and two other fake profiles are doing a technological fork split? Think about it for a second.
And no, it is not normal. These campaigns so close to "release" are a typical pump and dump campaign.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:50:55
That is the thing, the volume now is insanely low, they need a couple of hundreds BTC to manipulate one way or the other. But they do have a couple of millions USD on hand, this is for sure. They will double it though easily. But the amount payed for promotions on websites and Admob must be a 5 figure (a post on those scammy websites goes for about 5-10k)
They have also premined 2MLN B2X for no obvious reason so there might be another aspect to the scam. Maybe they are trying to hipe their coin so that it drives the price up and trades pick it up only to dump it later on. Whatever it is, it is no good.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:56:44
Huge difference. Bcash is a real thing with at least a few people behind it and real developers (with scammy intentions, but still real people with faces) - this is nothing, the "team" consists of 3 fake LinkedIn profile, it's a scam and it's rediculous how many people are falling for it. This speaks volumes about what kind of people are putting money into btc. This is not a real fork even.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:46:02
Could be, yes
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:16:20
There is no fork. The fork is the scam. People believing it, buying to get free coins, the price goes up,they hope to get free coins and hold, price goes up, the dump and the price goes down. Below 12-10k or not depends on the panic level after the year's end. Just read 2 posts above mine and the one below mine asking about  b2x, their handle. This scam is huge! This is the thing - the volume is minimal, around 18000 BTC on GDAX when Korea and Europe are out of the picture. They don't need a lot of money for this scam. But feel free to think whatever you feel like, I did my part in warning you. If you are hodler you will not be affected, but a lot of people will loose some money
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:59:23
I tried to warn people two days ago, but got downvotes from the 200000 new fomo subscribers...
Not sure if the mods here got payed off by these scammers, but all the posts about this scam are burried when they should be pinned. Just look around reddit and Twitter, they managed to fool a lot of people into believing this thing is real
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:06:21
I posted a post, this is the link. All explained there.
Your choice wether you want to believe it or not. But just 2 posts above mine someone is asking about B2X, their handle. The scam is huge...
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:24:27
Segwit2X is not a joke, this is a scam operation and a pump and dump campaign. Believe me, have seen this before. The paid campaigns, the email spam, the admob campaigns. Just check the daily, people are starting to ask where they are going to get their B2X coins from. This is what is driving the price up, they think this thing is real plus a small pump in the wee hours of all the trading(just check the pump from 14-15 today)
But feel free to think whatever you feel like.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:22:46
The volume has been sub 18k for 2 straight days. It just got up now when the price started rising. This is just FOMO money, this is the classic pump phase. And it rose on the lowest volume possible, 14k or so and at the end of the US market time zone.
Well, just wanted to warn you guys of what my observations are. Not well received, no problem, just loose some money.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:23:31
There is no fork, it's a scam, look on their website. Or do you expect a russian model fake linked in profile to actually be "in charge of business development"? No fork is happening, it is a pump and dump campaign and by the look of it, the fooled a lot of people here...
