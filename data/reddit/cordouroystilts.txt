Just about every other market...

You basically agreed on the coin price when you confirmed the purchase. So you have that many coins 'pending', no matter what happens to the price after.  If you plan on keeping them all in BTC and don't need to get to them for a minute then there is no drawback.  If you plan on moving them to another market then you are tied up in bitcoin until the coins arrive.  You should be able to see the amount you bought and when they should arrive on your 'history' page.

I didn't make the post.  Just witnessed the obvious censorship.  Am I not free to post in this thread?
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:21:44
On a post pointing out the censorship you guys are guilty of over here...

Did they eat his dick?

Depending on how backed up txs are.  In general tx are slow and expensive on BTC, but sometimes you can get a cheap one through quickly.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:42:29
I'm sure we all know what looks like happened tho.  One of you are censoring this sub and it needs to be addressed before this place becomes a full on echo chamber void of real discussion

I just dumped some alts I've had for awhile into BTC for the first time less than an hour ago.
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:44:04
Mark of the beast
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:41:32
How about transferring between different currencies?
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:11:35
Well then stopped deleting them!

The whole point of this post is to bring attention to the fact that mods are censoring content to fit a narrative.  I think the community deserves some real answers, not just threatening punishment for exposing this.
Censorship is wrong and you guys seem to be flailing over here.
One of you mods really need to answer for that posts removal.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:18:43
I've only made one post to in my life.  I have also messaged the mods.  Still waiting on an answer.
The fact that other users are making similar posts about censorship shows that it's an issue to the crypto community.  Because I keep responding to you and chimed in agreeing with one of those posters doesn't make me a spammer.  Just a concerned poster who is actively being silenced.
What are you scared of @_date: 2017-11-19 17:28:22
I'm unaware of that.  Feel free to give me some links and/or screenshots and I'll probably defend you on that if it was unjust.
All we want here is an answer and you fail to provide it.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:13:29
The previously removed post?  Or this one?
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:09:54
So this moderator answers with a link of reddits rules like it's sufficient.  
When asked why it was removed he claims he didn't do it.  It was another mod.  So ask them.
Why did you even respond then with your non answer?

@_date: 2017-11-18 05:53:37
That...kind of just blew my mind.

This surge got me checking dogecoin prices because I still have a sizeable wallet and holy shit that one skyrocketed too.
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:45:44
To the mooon!
@_date: 2017-05-20 22:17:53
Dogecoin made a big jump too.  Any chance this has to do with the ransomware?
@_date: 2017-07-18 00:46:48
Wats dat?!
