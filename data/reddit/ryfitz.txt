Monopolized a life saving drug and jacked up the price to unaffordable levels for most people.

Yes take the amount you sold for minus the amount you bought for to get your capital gain. If you bought and sold within the same year you will pay as if it was extra income. If you held for a year and sold you will pay anywhere from 0 - 20% depending on which income tax bracket you belong to.

Correct when you file your taxes for 2017 in early 2018 you will report the capital gains to your accountant/ accounting software and they will see how much you owe. It is always a good idea to record the date and gain/loss you received from trades throughout the year to make the process much easier. Remember you can write off some of your losses against your gains so if you happened to have a sell for a loss you can use that to lower the amount that you have to pay up to a certain limit.

Excellent point, it does seem like at this current speed all coins will be mined in a year or so, but in fact it will take quite a while longer because the mining difficulty is growing exponentially and the reward number of Bitcoin is set to half at select points.

Some believe there may be a bit of deflation once all coins are mined; as is pretty common place in markets with a closed amount of product and a hold in supply. As for more Bitcoin being produced this wouldn't need to be implemented since one Bitcoin can be broken down in many pieces, this is one of bitcoin's strengths extreme fungibility. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 23:02:30
How so? Since one Bitcoin is not worth more than another.

In a fraction of the time it took you to write out this pile of self-righteous garbage you could have just linked me to something actually worth while. As far as I'm
concerned paying a Bitcoin service in Bitcoin is no amazing feat, so skip the politics lecture and answer the question without being a complete twat next time thanks.

Might be a good idea to take Le Petit Jardin, the flower shop/cafe on Robertson in Los Angeles off. I went there a little over a month ago and they said they no longer accept Bitcoin because they lost their password to their wallet and I ended up having to pay with American Express.

Neither are a couple of the others on the list though, if I recall correctly pizza was one of the first things bought with bitcoin back when it was 10,000 btc for a pizza or something like that.

Did you check if Coinbase's app was on there?

I feel like this is the right mindset to have. I mean let's be honest here; the majority of people are not currently ready for Bitcoin, not to say that new innovations won't lead to more adopters, but currently most people need something much more simple and user-friendly. In order to get to the masses I believe it will take the help of some already established financial institutions; otherwise, why would the average person trust Bitcoin enough to get paid in it? Which is what we are shooting for... not just acceptance, but full on adoption.
@_date: 2014-09-18 21:16:47
The fact that you over-reacted so much after I asked a simple question makes me think your full of it. Why did you post on r/Bitcoin if you didn't want to answer any questions from Bitcoin users...
@_date: 2017-03-11 01:37:39
They probably waited in the hopes that Bitcoin was just a fad and would eventually die out and they wouldn't have to deal with it. It's actually a pretty smart approach from their point of view considering once they rule on it then they have chosen a side and it's often better to remain neutral since whichever way you go will undoubtedly piss somebody off.

A local Bitcoin ATM, localbitcoins.com, coinbase if you have a visa credit card to verify, and of course from another person you know who is willing to trade you for cash.

I've been using this for a few months now; it works great, now they just need an app for iOS.

Imagine if you had to answer these questions at an ATM to withdraw cash from your bank account; what a ridiculous invasion of privacy.

Here ya go... its a shame that Rogan and Redban dropped the ball on the second podcast and talked about smartphones for half the episode but the rest is still very interesting.
