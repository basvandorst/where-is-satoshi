No, sorry.  That's incorrect.  You determine the transaction fee and miners choose transactions based on them.  Neither miners nor the retailer controls them.
I'm asking how you determine the amount.
@_date: 2013-11-17 01:17:09
Yes, but it's early yet and retail adoption is still low.
If every store accepted Bitcoins it would happen enough that retail stores would at least require IDs to be recorded with every transaction.  Which really defeats the whole purpose.

That's all well and good, but I'm not here to debate cryptophilosophy with you.  I asked a specific question.  If you don't have a take on the answer then you can save us both the time.
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:46:35
How do you know how much of a transaction fee to add?
@_date: 2013-11-16 23:24:56
In other words, possible, and the only thing preventing it is the buyer deciding not to.

Technical analysis of what data set exactly?
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:09:10
Merchant processors have known addresses, just as the mining pools and exchanges do.
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:30:52
How do they reconcile transactions in time?
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:49:30
Perfect.  I appreciate you looking it up. I assumed it was a market-driven thing which to some extent it is, but that the amount was not part of the reference spec, so I didn't even look on Wikipedia.
Thanks again.

How exactly is the cost associated with attempting a 0-conf double-spend "incredible?"
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:44:43
Can I ask what you're basing this on?
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:47:05
I was thinking about growth among merchant processors specifically, maybe tracking transactions among their known addresses, but I'm not sure.  That's why I'm asking, to see if anyone else has been thinking about it.
It seems to me to be a very meaningful statistic in determining the difference between genuine growth in the Bitcoin economy and just an investor circle jerk bubble.

The minute it's worth it you will see black hat wallets that automate double-spend attempts.
It won't work all the time, but it will work often enough that another solution will need to be found.
@_date: 2013-11-17 02:09:23
It's not *that* hard.  But the mere fact that it's possible will limit adoption by serious retailers.
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:45:33
That's my problem, it's not economics because there's very little information about the fundamentals of the market.  It's guessing.
When you evaluate the market price of a stock or currency you at least have a base of statistics on the company or country on which to evaluate value.
Whenever people keep making assertions about Bitcoin price I keep asking "okay, why" and nobody answers.
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:36:01
Sorry, I don't understand.

How did he buy his first coins within minutes?
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:40:09
But aren't they vulnerable until it's confirmed?
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:47:04
But busy retailers can't wait for a couple of confirmations.  It's impractical for checkout.
@_date: 2013-11-17 02:41:32
The credit card companies absorb fraud, not the retailers.  Charge-backs are a resolvable dispute among three known parties with a contractual relationship.
Try telling national retailers that you have a new credit card you'd like them to accept, but they have to either make their customers wait around for up to 30 minutes before they get an approval, or let them leave with the stuff, and if the authorization comes back bad the have to eat the cost.
Try that and let me know how it goes.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:49:27
That's not correct.
You don't need to win 100 percent of the time, and a simple race attack is enough to win a reasonable number of times, no miners involved.  It can be executed solely from the wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:29:16
You don't have arguments.  Plain and simple.
If you could describe the basis of your analysis you would.  Instead you are quitting because you have nowhere to go.
Fine quit, but don't make up some dumb stories about how many post I have.  It's childish.
@_date: 2013-11-16 23:41:41
But you can't remotely compare it to just abject guesses dressed up as informed opinion.  Without any fundamentals, anyone speculating on the market is just writing Bitcoin fan fiction.

Seriously.  A single location in Bratislava?  I'm talking about real acceptance.  Walmart.  Target.  IKEA.
And "so far no one has provided any?"  Are you even educated on bitcoin?  Have you even read the relevant papers? No, you clearly haven't.
[This]( is how you execute a double spend race attack with a very high likelihood of success. It's not very hard for someone, or more likely a group of people, to execute.  When the reward is large enough it *will* happen unless alert messaging is implemented, and even that does not drop the risk to zero.
I can't believe I assumed you knew what you were talking about.  What a waste of time this has been.

Saying it hasn't happened is dumb because you can count the number of fast transaction brick and mortar retailers accepting Bitcoin on one hand.  The automobile was invented in 1886, but it took until 1899 for the first person to ever be hit by a car.
Suggesting that to prove my point I commit fraud for $460 is dumb on its own merits.
You will never, *never* see major fast transaction retailers accept Bitcoin until this is patched.  You simply can't pretend that you can look at retailers and say they have to take that on.  They will just ignore Bitcoin.
At least implement fast-propagating double spend alerts for chrissake.
