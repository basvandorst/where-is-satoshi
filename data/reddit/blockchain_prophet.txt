Sometimes it takes longer than I think. Dropping.
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:42:35
yep, even when you lose you win. this is the guy. never loses.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:01:33
very nice friends you have, you must be a really nice friend too

I'm the fucking prophet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:19:05
Its a fact can't disprove it
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:15:42
land is land, a crypto is nothing but something inside a computer. I can plant things on land and make money with it. I can't plant things in a crypto. What the fuck are you talking about? This is yout logic?
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:22:48
Check the drop in the coming days. Short bitcoin and long fiat or Litecoin or BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:01:03
It's no fud, it's a prophecy. Bitcoin will reach 7k in the coming days. Read my post history. I predicted the top and I'm predicting the bottom now. Meet your fucking prophet.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:09:49
Did I? It will keep droping. 10k today (in about 14 hours).
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:52:37
And dropping.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:39:42
How's it going, ready your wallet. I want my payment in Litecoin or fiat (it can be USDT if you want and I'll exchange fast enough for Litecoin of BCH (current hedge against Bitcoin crypto's). And never forget you made a bet with the prophet himself.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:08:35
"No bad news around to push the price further down today". It surprises me the low lever of intelligence in this sub lately. Venezuela just announced it's going to go all in in a Bitcoin-like coin called Petro. This is why Bitcoin is right now -10% from 20 minutes ago. This is not psychological sell off for european holders lol. What a fucking idiot you are. This move by Venezuela (the first country to do this) weakens Bitcoin. Imagine if the US announced that. We would be seeing -50% right now. Of course it will recover in 2-3 days. But this is no psychological sell off. Just hold your coins and don't try to trade ok? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:10:36
lol your logic is complete trash, even if they destroy the Bitcoins which no sane person would ever do, this would just make the remanining Bitcoins more valuable. You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. 100% clueless. Sorry bad English.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:26:29
No, you can actually eat things you get from planting seeds on land. Feeding is important so you can survive. There is minerals on a land. You can build your house on land. Please, are you serious? This is the kind of money flowing into Bitcoin (stupid). Bye.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:20:15
Now what? Keep watching. It takes time. Bitcoin is a resilient beast. This sell off will go for 3 - 7 days. Long Litecoin or fiat. Thank me later.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:57:57
From 16k to 15 is no drop? It will be at 10k tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:15:12
I'am right. Check the double lower tops Bitcoin made in the last 24 hours in a 15 min chart. It's all the way down from here. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:41:51
How many hours do I have left?
Edit: Bitcoin is a resilient beast, I expected a higher curve going down. It will still go down though.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:42:01
Yep. That's right. I make predictions in the Blockchain Space and make profits. Happy with that.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:10:14
That's why I'm the prophet and you're not. 10k in 14 hours from now.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:56:37
14,700k what it drop to 10k next 12 hours. Call me fool in 3 days.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:16:49
The prophet does not read long replies. Bless you.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:49:01
5 min is prophet level bro, you will see that in three days from now. Imagine how much money I'm trading on the prophecy.
edit: not much lol, I'm poor prophet :(
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:12:24
No they don't care about Venezuela. They care about all other countries that could do the same move. If you don't think this news is causing the dip right now you shouldn't be trading. Just hodl like your r/Bitcoin brothers.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:37:53
Check my post history and you'll see the prophecy.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:19:59
Sure, google has a lot, you just need to search como comprar Bitcoin, Bitcoin en espanol or something like that. Actually, it's easier to google then to make a post on Reddit. The answers are already there.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:35:45
Why don't you just let it netting you that amount? Why sell? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:34:47
Bro, Bitcoin is gone, 200k + transactions unconfirmed in mempool, bad upgrades incoming to try to avoid that, extreme long transaction times. You don't even use it, just HODL in your wallet and hope to make some fast cash. Tomorrow will be a bad day for you, Bitcoin is going to 10k, people will freak. The day after tomorrow Bitcoin will hit 7k and it will take a couple of months before reaching 17k again.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:31:01
So many dumb posts here lately, no wonder BTC price keeps going up.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:26:03
Buy Litecoin, send them to a wallet, wait 1 year. In 1 month Steam and other huge merchants will anounce they are accepting payments in Litecoin. Go all in and don't look back.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:20:56
I'm the fucking prophet bro.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:14:02
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:03:21
It's not FUD if it's happening. You can short Bitcoin and long Litecoin, BCH or Fiat in the coming days to protect yourself. This is no FUD. This is a prophecy and you heard from the blockchain prophet first.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:54:39
Sell BTC, long Litecoin, fiat or BCH for the hedge. Do not wait. The coming days will be dark.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:41:29
Do not buy yet. Check my post history and meet your fucking prophet.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:36:15
I already have some land, I'm fine. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:38:19
Says who? The person who claims to be a surfer of Crypto? lol
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:22:48
as you can see for the first two comments on your post, 99% of the people here are common Joe's with absolutely no idea how to access market information. They just buy and hold. That's why BTC price is what it is today. Dumb money flowing in. Take a look at BTC technology, compare with other coins / blockchains, make some maths, do you believe in the technology in the long term? Go for it. This will change the world, I'm not sure if Bitcoin is going to be the biggest market cap in 2 - 3 years, but the technology behind it will.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:06:57
I mean, it's your fault they didn't want to get involved with Bitcoin, even though you tried hard to convince them. You're so good and Godly. Are you a hero of some kind?
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:53:17
Droping. 12,500
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:48:51
up to a week I think its a good guess with a low fee and 200,000 k transactions unconfirmed. good luck investing in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:37:03
Check my post history. You'll see the prophecy.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:27:25
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:10:40
The prophet is always right. Only once I was wrong, when I thought I was wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:11:27
It's not lost, it will just take a lot of time to confirm because there are transactions with much higher fees that will be completed first. The higher the fee the faster the chances of a faster transaction, specially when the mempool lists 200k + unconfirmed transactions (bitcoin can handle aprox. 4 transactions per second) if the rate of transactions is over 4/sec then there is a pool of unconfirmed transactions waiting confirmation. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:22:58
Watch. This is 15700 highest price for weeks coming.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:11:14
wrong. by far the oldest block chain: right.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:48:58
welcome to yesterday
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:18:18
That's why BTC will recover its price in 1 - 2 days. It's just a reaction to the news bro. Don't worry, I 100% agree with you, but the big players will put selling pressure over "bad" news. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:56:04
Yep, that's what the people said to prophets before they became prophets. I'm a fool.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:43:02
5 more. It's about to drop. Maybe 10. Bitcoin is very resilient. But it's going down for once.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:52:47
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:54:02
Remind me tomorrow.  Prophets also need to sleep.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:54:09
Ready my post history and meet your prophet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:21:04
They are the ones pumping the price sky high. Bitcoin is not a good investment in the short term. This is going to implode.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:38:53
no begging
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:55:17
I'm the prophet.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:16:56
touche, post will be deleted by the mods if they already didnt delete and I'm here writing in vain. sorry but I think your are right too.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:44:35
Too bad 3 % of the bitcoin wallets hold 95% of all Bitcoin available. Price rise is only making those 3% richer. You are just a puppet here. Drop while its time.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:39:40
Not everyone is rich as you are to don't mind the fees. Actually, you are the 5% that don't mind the fees. Normal people do, and they are the ones buying Bitcoin at 15k. Let's talk again in a couple of days when Bitcoin is 7k usd (mega fall incoming). Reming me, check my username.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:38:10
So you knew Maduro was going to announce a state backed Bitcoin? No you didn't (that's what's causing the dip). You just guessed it would fall and voila! 50% 50%. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:55:44
I am the future.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:44:18
Sweet. I think I'll win 0,001 BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:41:43
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:27:04
Good lord so many stupid people here lately.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:46:18
You will call me prophet in 3 days.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:47:44
good luck investing in Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:08:46
It will keep dropping. Bitcoin is a resilient Beast like anything I've ever seen. But the beast will fall for a few days. I'm the prophet. I called the top yesterday at 16,7k and I said it was going to drop to 10k and it will.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:43:10
Triple lower tops formation, watch it fall.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:24:43
Why are you selling it?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:16:40
You go explain that to the market. Explain to all players that your sacred Bitcoin is your god and no other coin would ever take over. Sorry bro, the market don't think like you do. If a government announces a government backed cryptocurrency like Venezuela just did and many countries will follow in the coming years then it weakens Bitcoin, no matter how hard you try to convince yourself otherwise. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:36:07
dont get scammed boyz, please.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:57:22
Bitcoin economist expert here. My best guess would be around eight.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:45:29
Of course not. Technical analysis is just a confirmation of my predictions. There are many ingredients involved.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:16:39
10k and you have your bet. I've never seen anything (investment related) so resiliant as Bitcoin. But I'm the god damn prophet. And it is happening. But I'm also a serious man. I'll bet 0,01 BTC lower than 10k.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:24:00
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:03:51
Bitfinex. It will be below 10k by Sunday night.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:17:41
The Bitconnect ad turned me off. But it was a nice read and I hope you can grow your blog with time. Just make sure you don't put a "hated" advertiser on your site (because r/Bitcoin hate Bitconnect). Anyway, you have a lot of room to grow, make sure you make the right choices :) I like your blog (just disliked the ad but hey, I think I hate all ads not only this one).
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:25:01
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:51:59
Are you still waiting?
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:13:52
Me too.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:54:42
And I'm sleeping on a levered trade of 5000 usd long on Litecoin and short on Bitcoin for 3 hours now.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:19:02
It always takes a little longer than what the prophet says. The prophet's time underestimate BTC. This is one of the most resilient assets I've ever seen in 20 years trading on prophecies. Never seen anything like that. To predict a sell on BTC and actually go short levered on it is already a fucking miracle for me. Been there since 16,700. Too bad I have very little money. But I'll make 300% or more in the coming days, and that's mega profits for a poor prophet.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:07:36
Ready my post history. Meet your prophet.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:00:57
My bad. 0.01.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:14:59
Bitcoin is a resilient beast like anything I've ever seen. Even the prophet needs more time some times. Give it time, it will drop below 10k in the next couple days. You heard first from the prophet. Never forget. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:36:51
I have cryptos also, but not Bitcoin atm. I'll buy again (Bitcoin) the day after tomorrow at 7k. Check my username, write it down, talk to me in two  days.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:43:27
And you head first from the prophet.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:52:27
Don't forget that the richest also have multiple wallets, further tightening the statistics. Do you think people will invest in Bitcoin when they realize they can't have more than 5% of the total Bitcoins? Sorry. Distribution of wealth using Bitcoin is unfair (early adopters make huge money not because they are smart or more competent, just because they got it first, and this is not right). So let me tell you what's going to happen, at some point someone will come up with a better coin that will be more democratic in terms of its distribution and I will invest in that coin. No way I'm rising the price of Bitcoin so a few whales can enjoy their lambos. Bye.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:41:22
Because this move weakens Bitcoin. Imagine if the US announce a state backed blockchain crypto. Bitcoin would dip 20x harder.

There was a flash crash, thanks for the confirmation.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:27:15
The price of Bitcoin is made at the exchanges and many went down yesterday and today still. And people are looking for information on that and we have many posts about that. This is a way to organize that information. And it is critical information for many people here, you can see that by the number of upvotes on the post. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:37:33
No begging. You should read the rules before posting.

**Bitcoin Hedge Card**
Bitcoin Hedge Card is the first Bitcoin hedging credit / debit card. First you deposit fiat money into you Bitcoin Hedge Account. Now, you can buy things with merchants who accept Bitcoin with your "soon to be extinct" fiat money so you don't have to spend your precious Bitcoins and you can pay using Bitcoins at THE SAME TIME! YOU BUY WITH BITCOINS BUT YOU KEEP YOUR BITCOINS UNTOUCHED!
**How it works.** We use the fiat money in your Bitcoin Hedge Account to buy Bitcoins at the exact moment of your purchase and we transfer those Bitcoins to the corresponding merchant's Bitcoin wallet, allowing the purchase of a Bitcoin good with fiat money and without wasting your Bitcoins!
**Why Bitcoin Hedge Card?** We all know fiat money is dying. With Bitcoin Hedge Card we debit the value of the purchase from your fiat reserves and credit the merchant in Bitcoins, allowing your to:
1. Keep your Bitcoin investment untouched;
2. Contribute to the usability and the ecosystem of Bitcoin.
**Register today for a FREE Bitcoin Hedge Card!**
