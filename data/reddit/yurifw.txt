thanks, i think this is my last question xD
what is the procedure for withdrawing money with the Xapo card? Supose she has a debit card with 1000 dollars, could she use any bank's atm to withdraw those 1000 dollars?

You're welcome, you probably saved my friend from a lot of unexpected trouble, you deserved it :)

coinmap says there is one at auckland, is it outdated?
edit: hey, i'm thinking that using a debit card service like advcash or xapo would be a good idea if there are no ATM's, what do you think?

i'll take a look at the sub, should have thought of it xD
thanks a lot

thanks, that is really helpfull.
Can i ask you a couple more questions?
She is going to live in NZ from 6 to 12 months, she has no bank accounts there. Do you think it will be hard for her to live with a debit card like the one from Xapo or ADVCash? Or do you think it would be better if she tried to open a bank account? She is going to live in Auckland.

The coins don't fui straight to the address you send them, that is normal

"I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners," Clinton continued. "It doesn't do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after. There must be some way. I don't know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts."
This made me laugh

dormant wallet of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, which experts have said is no longer accessible.
How can these experts know it?

Yep, recommended Linux to a friend, she asked me to install it on her pc and I did. Biggest mistake in my whole life.

If the page was only client side i believe you could, but i am kind of a Noob in blockchain technology

it is already synced, when i mentioned that i made the transaction before it finished updating, there were only 7 hours left, now it shows that it processed 382090 blocks of transaction history

why don't you make an alarm with no snooze button?

Bitcoin is only anonymous while no one can link your Wallet to you, you have to think: in this transaction, would you give them any information that could be used to identify you? For example, a bank account, address, email, phone number or your real name...
If you did, there are services that can anonymize your coins for you

I had a Wallet created by bitcoin core 0.10, i don't want to create a new Wallet because i want a Wallet compatible with bitcoin core, also i havê a few dollars in the Wallets i am trying to resto de...

sorry about the questions, i'm trying to use this coinkite, but it don't seem to allow my private key. It seems to only accept the BIP format of wallet, just like multibit. Am I right or am I doing something wrong?
@_date: 2015-10-27 05:10:24
I thought só, but it doesn't sync, i already restarted it a million times, each time.using a different server, it didn't work. Sometimes it syncs only 1 Wallet, and a n i try to use the other, it keeps syncing forever, but mostra of the times, none of the wallets sync
@_date: 2015-10-26 22:37:11
I tried to setup multisig. For what i saw, sweep would only be useful if i already had a Wallet in coinkite, right?
@_date: 2015-10-26 17:43:12
maybe i'm wrong, but for what i read in their website, that is not a wallet, i generates a key pair to be used as wallets, bu i could not send bitcoind to another person using their software, right?
