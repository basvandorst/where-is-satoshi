"Bitcoin and the related technology has never been for newbies, though. And probably will never be."
The Internet in 1990 wasn't for newbies either.
Personal computers in the 1980's weren't for newbies.
The automobile in 1920 wasn't for newbies.
The printing press and books in the Middle Ages weren't for newbies.
Agriculture in early prehistory wasn't for newbies.

This is classic Keynesian indoctrination, peddled by the crony capitalists in our political elite and banking sector, who seek to enrich themselves at the expense of people further down the chain. If loans for entrepreneurs are costlier, it discourages malinvestment and boom/bust cycles - furthermore, money hoarded and used for investment does find its way back into the economy, more capital is available for new projects and 'good' economic growth, as opposed to propping up a zombie economy - which WILL correct once no more credit can be pumped into the system.
People still have incentive to spend a deflationary currency for goods they want - they still have a utility function despite what you may believe - it just isn't skewed towards wasteful overconsumption of low quality consumer shit, which I'd say was a good thing wouldn't you? the environment would certainly agree.

Reddit is a pretty leftist website in general - a lot of 'useful idiots' here.

This has already been attempted years ago, Microsoft Security Essentials flagged portions of the blockchain as containing suspicious strings and kept deleting the blockchain data as it was being downloaded. This was quickly resolved though
At this point there is no way to kill Bitcoin. Governments lost the war the moment Satoshi published his whitepaper. They may have stopped Bitcoin if they had made a concerted effort in the first few years - but at that point Pandora's box was already opened with regard to crypto - there was now a viable alternative to using government issued fiat money designed to enslave the populace. For every step forward goverments make to regulate and limit the use of bitcoin, the community takes 2 steps ahead of them in implementing new privacy protocols, enhancing fungibility, driving adoption through decentralised exchanges and removing barriers to entry.

So BoE takes the concept of digital currencies, strips out all the properties that make them attractive and twists it into an insidious communist style centrally planned e-currency?

Interesting article. Is the consensus within the QC community now that quantum computers can be scaled up to the required number of Qubits without succumbing to decoherence? Or could there still yet be some fundamental limit to how many qubits its possible to isolate from the rest of the universe?

Will there be a 32-bit version?

Yet another article referencing number of active bitcoin addresses falling since January, that fails to take into account or even aknowledge the fact that batching and segwit is being more widely implemented. 5 minutes of googling would have revealed this to them. Do they even understand bitcoin at all?

Is there a similar law in the UK do we know?
