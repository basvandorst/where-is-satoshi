Joseph Stalin and the Sun were best friends back in the day. 
In the morning, when Stalin would look out the window, he would look up at the sun smiling down at him and say 'Good Morning Sun!' to which the sun would reply 'Good morning comrade Stalin!'
At Midday, Stalin would step outside and look at the sun smiling down at him and say 'Good day Sun!' and the sun would reply 'Good day comrade Stalin!'
As night fell, before Stalin went to bed he opened the window and said 'Good night Sun!' but the sun did not reply. Confused, Stalin stepped outside and said again 'Good night Sun!' again, to no reply. Finally, Stalin yelled as loud as he could 'Sun! why won't you respond!?!?' And off in the distance could be heard: 'Fuck you I'm in the west now!'

That's a very naive prediction. 
The idea Bitcoin is built around, an electronic currency that doesn't answer to the banks, is one I subscribe to. However, I don't think Bitcoin will ever catch on as THE electronic currency.

The comments on that article are terrifying. What is the consensus here? Is this shutdown legit? If it is, god help us.

Got mine when it went to 560. Should have waited a little longer, but I still ended up with a profit.

It's by no means a revolution. There is very little violence taking place, and not that many people involved. It's only Kiev that seems to be getting the spotlight.

Thanks! I'm a little skeptic about buying in the current volatile state of the market (the price is fluctuating between 560 and 580) As someone who is more experienced in the market, do you think the value of bitcoin will continue to drop, or start to recover?
