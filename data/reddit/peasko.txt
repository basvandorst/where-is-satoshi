That is the big misconception.  Mike Hearn breaks it down in that article.

The whole article is about consensus and forks, its even in the title.  There are a lot of misunderstandings of the difference between soft fork and hard fork and the line can also be blury between them.  People seem to not understand the danger of soft forks, and that soft forks don't always require consensus and can force people who don't agree with them to go along.  Its all in the article, Mike does a great job breaking it down for even the layman to understand.

I said yes it is feasible meaning it is a danger to worry about, and then provided evidence why, in the form of a very detailed and excellent article about the dangers of soft forks and consensus by a prominent Bitcoin developer in the community named Mike Hearn.  I hope you read the whole article.

I never said the article said anything about coin supply.  The article is about consensus and forks, and explains how soft forks can sneak rules in and nodes will accept the new-rule-blocks without even knowing the rule exists.  That is where the danger comes from.  Because of this is why there is a danger for a minority to force rules on the majority including coin supply rules.

Sir with all do respect, are you being serious?  Please stop playing word games with me.  My comment was on topic and perfectly logical to anybody reading.  Perhaps you have a reading and comprehension problem. Or you just feel like being an annoyance because you get some thrill out of it.

Yes its actually pretty feasible with a soft fork because when a soft fork happens it sneaks itself in without even notifying nodes of a rule change.  So even nodes who are against raising the 21 mil cap may be tricked to go along with it.  Mike Hearn breaks some of this down in the following article:

Sir, you have been nothing but unfriendly to me.  I made a comment, and you twisted it and started behaving like I lied about the article mentioning coin supply, when the article did not mention coin supply.  The article was about forks and consensus, and how consensus is not needed for soft forks.  Therefore I extrapolated that since consensus is not much needed for soft forks, then coin supply rules could also be in danger.  That is all sir, so please stop twisting my words.  I don't appreciate you making tricks to paint me as a liar.
