You're still a moron if you think the dollar value of each coin is the only measure of it's worth as a technology.
You need to realize the legitimacy of BTC comes not from how many dollars it's worth but from it's potential to revolutionize our world.

What the fuck does the conversion rate has to do with how "alive" a cryptocurrency is?
@_date: 2014-03-20 15:14:15
Well no matter how many people he asked, if nobody knew he can safely say less than 1% knew.
@_date: 2014-09-09 00:10:24
Well that's just awesome.

My bank, 6 months after giving me a credit card decided I didn't fit the profile after all and cancelled it without notice, charging me every future payment I had right then.   
    :) I wanted to bomb their shit.

B2B BTC would make me wet.

Can't come sooner?

I think it's part of their super-safe fully legal norm-compliant paradigm.
@_date: 2014-09-22 22:58:20
What a bunch of thugs and bullies. And they're using your taxes to do this.
@_date: 2014-08-04 16:49:12
You're on some list now
@_date: 2014-09-17 21:41:23
Couldn't you potentially add literally anything?
@_date: 2014-09-08 23:17:22
Oh... the automated part is awesome, that alone will make me use your service, and I assume this means every single match could be covered?   
   And could you elaborate on "players betting on themselves", do you mean regular players on regular matches?

It's like the time my city got it's first religious apocalypse nutjob with his signs on the street, we knew we were no longer a small town. :')

Not in a society with inclusive political and economic institutions and a level playing field.

Hadn't looked at it that way, pretty neat!
@_date: 2019-02-05 17:52:22
A bit off topic, but kudos to Australian media for doing stuff like this, I could only dream of the media in my country doing a front-page like this where the big banks, companies and the government don't mess with each other.

I think the shittyness of the original was that made it for me , great skills though
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:24:08
Oh god now I don't want BTC to reach 10k
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:35:12
I guess this means there's an open space for a good BTC news website

You might even call it a... surprise inspection.
@_date: 2015-09-30 15:22:31
It's also disgusting, we should all be educated in basic economics and finance, it's how the world works and the great majority is clueless as to how it all works.
@_date: 2015-03-24 21:57:01
I don't give a crap about bitcoin's value, I'm just waiting for mass adoption for the functional value, niggas acting like it's an investment are part of the problem.
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:15:46
Guys I've a question: What would prevent a big actor from selfishly using the main blockchain despiste most of the world moving to the LN for small txs, ruining it for the rest of us?
@_date: 2019-05-19 04:28:32
Most likely a new service they'll offer in AWS
