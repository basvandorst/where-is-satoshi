Will alt season be like 2017? Will there even be an alt season? Will a few alts pump while the others remain chained to the floor? I’m not posting this to be an azz. I’m posting this to stoke a real conversation about this.

The real question will be what will be the top?
@_date: 2019-07-13 20:39:42
I agree! However the BTC blockchain is a store of value, that won’t change. With regards to it being a currency is another debate however the technology can always be upgraded etc.

If we can close *end the day*  above $11,300 I think we will bounce back to new highs within the next few weeks

Domestic fees per transaction are 2.49% (1.49% crypto conversion fee + 1% transaction fee). In Europe, fee per transaction is 2.69% (0.20% + standard 2.49%). And Internationally, fee per transaction is a whopping 5.49% (3% + standard 2.49%). 
The 2.49% additional fee is the "crypto liquidation fee," which is apparently incurred every time you make a transaction.

Already bought at 11,000$ it seems the flip reversal has already started
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:09:56
I don’t think we will see a 4 digit bitcoin again.. More people are talking about Bitcoin, volume &amp; hash rate is highest it’s ever been whilst fees have kept low. I’m extremely bullish long term.

While the Coinbase Card makes spending your cryptocurrency quick and easy, it isn’t the cheapest way of spending your cryptocurrency with a debit card in the UK. You’ll be charged an issuance fee of £4.95, a cryptocurrency exchange fee of 2.49%, and additional transaction fees outside the UK.

Moving sideways maybe?
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:42:49
I would argue this is good news as it shows maturity as more hands accumulate Satoshi .. Thoughts?

100% Hypervolatile, but this is a Buying Moment
@_date: 2019-06-29 23:00:42
Fees 
This is a Visa card, so it should work with any merchant on the Visa network. The company is launching a separate mobile app called Coinbase Card to manage your cryptocurrency balances. For instance, you’ll be able to choose whether you want to use your Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin balance with your card.

Newbies that just joined the crypto space because of all the attention it's getting recently, enjoy this first lesson that Bitcoin is serving you now on the plate. When everyone are greedy, be fearful and when everyone is fearful, be greedy. Daily candle soon closing, and the way it looks we are in for a reversal. Market moves up, market moves down, parabolic runs don't last, if you lived through 2017 and haven't yet learned that lesson, maybe this time you will.
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:43:55
Amen! Just don’t miss the boat! 
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:16:41
Well the bears came out of their slumber to play again.... Corrections are to be expected. BTC is a roller coaster so enjoy the ride. I am seeing an upward trend forming so keep your pull ups on guys and gals!
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:05:28
I’m confused it is my understanding if you tested the BTC first time on an address which worked fine and you used the old addresses again it will still work absolutely fine.. this is just a privacy feature.
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:32:28
On average, every year so far, the value of Bitcoin has increased by about a factor ten. From 0.1 dollar in 2010, to 1 dollar in 2011, to 10 dollar in 2012, to 100 dollar in 2013. From now on, there's a slight slowdown, as the value increased by a factor ten every two years, to 1,000 dollar in 2015, to 10,000 in 2017, 100,000 in 2019, and 1,000,000 in 2021. From here onwards, there's no good way of expressing its value in dollars, as the dollar is no longer used, nor is any central bank issued currency for that matter. There are two main forms of wealth in today's world. Land and cryptocurrency.
Never sell Bitcoins ever
@_date: 2019-06-30 13:54:10
If it goes down it means I can buy more 
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:00:13
I agree, volatile times ahead. People that don’t have bitcoin hope for it to crash because they don’t want to see others success
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:09:21
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:45:58
Good question. In my opinion it comes down to being over extended in a parabolic move. When people FOMO  into buying, the price is left to be manipulated due to present time low market cap, it allows whales to cash in and weak hands don’t want to be left holding the back in a extremely volatile market.

I’ve found this a great opportunity to buy more! I bought extra BTC at 11,000$, the bull market is just getting started..
@_date: 2019-06-30 13:39:22
My understanding is all conversion of crypto to fiat are a capital gains taxable event.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:34:47
I hope you didn’t quit it after that dip in price

Stranger things have happened I’m sure

The distribution of BTC isn’t something to be afraid of in the long term
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:00:27
It is true to say there are gaps to be filled in the future markets however with the macro factors in play globally such as US tensions, trade wars, imminent global financial crash, rallying gold and Bitcoin 2020 halving, it cannot come quick enough surly?
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:28:28
16.7k coming
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:16:20
It’s scary stuff indeed. However these vast movements have happened multiple times in BTC history however in long term it’s only gone/going one way ��
@_date: 2019-06-29 13:23:44
None what’s so ever, why would you give a stranger any kind of money if they are not regulated in some form?
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:13:44
In the long term I believe we are going to 32,000$ I would rather go up slowly over a number of weeks &amp; month than parabolic movements.
