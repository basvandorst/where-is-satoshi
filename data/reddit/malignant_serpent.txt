Here's the full quote that I'm on about:
- The Crown owes The Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.
- How much?
- A tremendous amount. 
- There must be someone in the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement. 
- **The Iron Bank is The Iron Bank, there is no "someone".**
- **Someone does work there, it is comprised of people.** 
- **And the temple is comprised of stones. One stone crumbles and another takes it's place, and the temple holds it's form - for a thousand years or more. That's what The Iron Bank is. A temple. We all live in it's shadow, yet almost none of us know it.**

Well thank you, captain obvious.

Bitcoin just fell by roughly 3%. Let's compare:
* 20 july 2015: gold price falls by 4% compared to USD in a flash crash
* 4 october 2016: british pound falls by 6% compared to USD in a flash crash
* 20 january 2015: swiss franc shot up by 30% compared to EUR/USD in one morning.
It's not ideal, but it's not perfect for other "established" currencies either.

Have you watched "Ulterior States"?

, Gentlemen, by all means, please go on. This is tremendously interesting and informative. I've been wondering about this for months with nowhere to ask, and suddenly there's this discussion.

Satoshi started naming the concept "the block chain", so i'd go with author's naming. 
Going further if you want to name the *product* of the block chain technology, formally it would be something like "the probabilistic distributed byzantine-resiliant consensus", but at that that point it's just easier to go for the inventor's name, so you get a clean &amp; simple "Nakamoto consensus". IMHO it sounds cool, too. 
For my money naming your company "Blockchain" or "Coinbase" abuses the naming convention, and it shows a total lack of creativity on it's creators part. At it's best it's cheap and confusing, especially in a field where proprietary names bounce around in almost every discussion.

Thank you, will do.

Author of the subs here, thanks :-) I was wondering who the people are and saw that a lot of viewers were asking for it too, writing down what was said was a good way for me to delve deeper into the topic and do some research to understand it better. 
Here's hoping they'll help spread Tomer's awesome work! I'm now translating them into Polish to show my friends &amp; maybe a bit wider community. It's cool to see that the documentary was translated into few different languages already. 
I highly recommend researching a bit further on some of the people who appeared, especially Jessi Baker, Elisabeth Stark, Ian Grigg, Vinay Gupta, Brett Scott, and, well, all the others. Great and inspiring people all the way :-)

I rest my case.

He invented the block chain. 
Edit: invented, not created.

Thanks, but honestly... It would be a mother of all ironies if Satoshi Nakamoto, the grand-master cryptographer, was uncovered through shitty HTML tags :-)

If you would block other people from mining your block chain but allow them to store a copy on their computers, you would at least retain the ability to alert users of most obvious sheanigans going on (like straight stealing from someone or destroying evidence), but nothing really past that. It's not much use in reality. 
If you would block the ability of mining AND copying, then you'd end up with a simple database, with none of the benefits, that uses 100% of server's CPU power no matter what.

And there's more in the source code :-)

As correctly pointed out, this is just a standard practice happening in all industries. 
Here in my firm (Polish equivalent of Target or Radio Shack) we had more than 100 retailers not more than 20 years ago, and through mergers and busts they've become just 4. 
One entity employing one team of managers and accountants will always be more effective than two separate entities with two independent teams (as long as they still have the outside pressure from other competing entities).

He did on Twitter, but all he said is that the debate needs more computer science and less noise, and proposed that both sides of the debate calm their arguments down, if i recall right. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 17:38:45
Let's ask him for an example of said computer science :-)

He did endorse Pieter Wuille's proposal of scaling the block size by 14.4% every year to match the falling DRAM prices.

Well as % of total available supply 7500 bitcoins are equeal to almost 6 tonnes of gold (0.035% of 171300 tonnes = 5995.5 kg), so yeah.
