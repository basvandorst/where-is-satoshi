Why would we expect anything different from the people who lost $72 million of our money through gross negligence.

Wow if you remove all the months when the price goes down from the chart, then you are only left with the price going up.   What a surprise and how illuminating.

It's largely a backlash to years of telling everyone that Bitcoin was "free" for transactions or "It costs 2 cents to send $2 million".  So basically those people were full of shit and we now know that.
However I have no problem with the fees myself and use Priority fee with Mycelium and don't care about spending 0.25 USD to send a few thousand $s worth.

Price was below $200 last year.  But maybe was above $200 for 2 years before that...I don't remember.

Yes exactly.  They are f'ing evil.

You are stupid, because they haven't done KYC/AML on non-verified accounts in the past.  There was always a risk this could happen, but risk was small and not even sure if this story is true.  I hope it is though because I would love to see Finex lose even more of their remaining customers.

Good suggestion, and done.  I posted it there myself.   We owe this to the Bitcoin community to make people aware of what Bitfinex is and what they do.   
I don't have a lot (although some) sympathy for those who stayed with them after the hack, but there are noobs out there who need to be clued in, for their own safety.

Yes good suggestion...that's about the best course of action at this point.  Then leave Bitfinex and never look back.  That's what I did after the hack/theft.

And that 2.6% came from funds that they still from all customer accts when they did the "haircut".  Some of that money is mine.
