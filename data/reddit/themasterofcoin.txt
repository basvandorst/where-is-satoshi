Looks awesome! Can you provide details about what the graph is representing?
@_date: 2015-12-03 01:37:28
Thanks for the helpful link! 
@_date: 2015-12-11 03:06:25
Correct me if I am wrong, but has the hashrate has almost doubled since the beginning of September?
@_date: 2015-12-12 05:02:03
This is the roll portion of the good times, my friend.
@_date: 2015-06-02 03:16:00
Thanks for the response! I will try again. I would suggest listing this in your facts. Also, your site on mobile safari could use a slight bit of tweaking.  But great service and I have enjoyed using it so far!

Bitcoins are going on sale!
@_date: 2014-12-11 20:04:23
Do you have a version where the Bitcoin logo is in the fourth square (not a circle)?
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:58:40
This. Also, the update looks great compared to my old Rubik's cube.
@_date: 2014-07-08 00:02:44
As of right now 16.06 is the equivalent.  But yes you are correct.  I am currently working on adding bits -&gt; USD conversions as well.
@_date: 2014-06-19 17:22:57
Cannot wait for the release!
@_date: 2014-06-22 19:31:45
Have been waiting to order one of your cards, but I am finally going to take the plunge. Do you have a coupon code for us reddit users?
@_date: 2014-06-25 05:49:48
I would love to buy one! 
@_date: 2014-07-10 04:38:45
What is your favorite alternative? I haven't had the gumption to make the switch. 
@_date: 2014-12-25 20:56:50
Guide to this setup?

Would you be using tor with your "offline" wallet to broadcast the transaction? Or would you use tor on the online watch only wallet to broadcast?
@_date: 2014-07-02 19:08:11
Looks like a start to a walkthrough/guide. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 00:00:20
Installed the app and for some reason it isn't scanning the 1 at the beginning of my address. Also, instead of the "Send" button, it would be more comforting having it say "Search".
@_date: 2014-07-02 05:39:08
This point exactly.
@_date: 2014-09-26 20:45:41
Ease of sending payment to anyone instantly. Friend mails me beer from the wonderful state of Michigan, and I send him Bitcoin instantly without having to wait 3-5 days for PayPal or the banking system. 
@_date: 2014-07-15 05:48:04
I'll buy one for 8000 bits.
@_date: 2014-06-24 16:46:20
Fair enough
@_date: 2014-06-24 14:19:11
Use the online watch only electrum wallet to create the transaction, and the offline electrum wallet to sign the transaction, back to the online watch only electrum wallet to broadcast. I think of it kind of like signing a check with the offline computer. 
@_date: 2014-07-15 05:48:44
I'll take one!
@_date: 2014-07-28 03:24:36
I am working on deploying a website this week that depicts how to set up offline electrum on a raspberry pi or you can purchase a precompiled set up from the website. Similar to the offline NetBook solution.

So you're telling me... You stop browsing during the day?
@_date: 2014-07-26 21:40:30
I went into PNC to dispute an overdraft fee and the associate saw my frequent coinbase purchases and proceeded to ask about bitcoin and its benefits.  He seemed thoroughly interested and at no time did he mention the bank not liking bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-24 23:12:27
I would be interested in this.
@_date: 2014-06-24 14:20:32
Where does one find a laminator without having to spend .1 BTC to buy one?
@_date: 2014-12-12 01:49:57
Thanks! Do you happen to have the time to format this image for the iPhone 6+?
@_date: 2014-10-08 17:44:36
Can you expand on burning bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-06-24 16:45:47
I understand that concept, hence why I asked my question about why you recommended connecting with tor?
Clarification: You never said switch back to your online machine to connect with tor. I understood what you meant, but someone not familiar with the process might have misunderstood your process.
@_date: 2014-11-05 02:09:26
Will you still be here tomorrow?
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:07:08
Exactly this. I have an old block erupter solo mining away at 333mh. The chances of finding a block are almost nill but I'm still supporting the network.
@_date: 2014-06-22 23:20:06
Great! Thanks. How long is the sale?
@_date: 2015-05-28 20:14:20
For some reason, only purse instant is available to me. I've already made a purchase with purse but I don't want to only get the 5% discount. How can I enable the "set your own" discount? Anyone else in the same boat?
@_date: 2014-07-20 03:08:49
I came here looking for the cheddar ;)

It's owned by a family member. Pm me for more details. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 19:15:12
There is one in PA. pm me for details. Edit: I also have a 1998 Lexus ES 300 for sale.

@_date: 2015-01-08 04:18:28
I tried to send some Bitcoin I purchased  yesterday from my Coinbase account today at 3pm and almost 9 hours later it is still pending and not showing up on the blockchain. 
Edit: It ended up being a problem with mycelium wallet not being able to sync to the blockchain. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 14:33:13
I'm not disagreeing with you, but I am pretty sure network latency has improved vastly since 1996 and we should expect to see a similar increase over the next 20 years. With faster networking speeds, we should see faster block propagation.  Dial up was the norm in the 90s but now... Not so much. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 03:21:24
Unfortunately not all copies are shipped in a plastic sleeve. Mine arrived with a torn cover...
@_date: 2015-01-20 13:09:58
Awesome stuff.
@_date: 2015-05-23 12:45:39
How many purchases do I need to make to set my own discount? I am disappointed purse doesn't disclose this. 
Edit: thanks for clarifying

I thought we all knew that nice guys finish last?

I would love to help out but at this time I don't know C++, aside from a class I took my freshman year of college. Any suggestions on how to get up to speed? 
@_date: 2017-03-22 23:21:41
You are correct! I was surprised to see bitcoin listed automatically under the port forwarding options. Thumbs up to FiOS.

This. I had a great experience using bazaarhound purchasing this book.
@_date: 2015-04-17 11:04:38
I currently have Bitcoin stuck in my mycelium wallet on my iPhone 6 Plus running 8.1.2. I do have a backup of my seed. What are the best options to retrieve the locked funds? Can I restore the seed onto the mycelium play store app?
Absolutely love the app and have recommended it to many, but this has been a frustrating experience to say the least.
@_date: 2015-04-17 14:09:12
Great! Thanks for the reply.
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:41:51
You can also use tails OS. It already has electrum installed, just make sure to write down your seed.

Thanks for the feedback! I will try my best to implement them.
