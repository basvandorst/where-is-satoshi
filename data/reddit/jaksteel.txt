How do you go coinbase to PayPal?!
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:20:57
When you’ve got quite a bit invested you can’t just give up though :( hopefully you get it sorted 
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:19:41
Is it as simple as moving x amount of GBP and then withdrawing it?
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:42:45
You have to send them a Euro for you to withdraw
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:44:18
How does that remotely make sense lmao, you have to send them a euro to withdraw that’s the problem, read the fucking thread before commenting

Seems my bank cant do it due to it being an under 18 account that I haven’t upgraded and my SO can’t due to it being a minimum send, plus a £10 sending fee
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:31:09
Any guide on how to move it?
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:13:49
Me too! The first two weeks my eyes haven’t left the coinbase app while I’m at work constantly looking at the money I’m making.. while earning money.. it’s great! Hodl on fellow brit 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:18:51
What about paying me in it?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:50:26
Is the massive drop due to bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:11:20
Define active?

How do I get it to PayPal?!
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:39:39
Man I’m great I’m 19 with a bit invested.. doubles my profits in two weeks when I bought in at 7400, 9000 and 11000.. loving life and holding working my future out 
@_date: 2018-05-29 18:26:54
I have tried publicising it and nothing has changed, still have a lot of money there and not sure where or how to get it out..
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:37:31
Withdrew x amount, 3 days after delivery date messaged them (email support) and apparently they had sent my funds without a trace back to my bank. 3 months later nothing has changed and they still have no answer to when I’m going to get my funds. Can provide evidence to those it’s needed for :)
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:47:48
Sounds exactly like what’s happened to me will try that
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:26:05
Also is GDAX down now too? Coinbase has just gone again for me also..
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:23:43
So all I gotta do is use the SEPA transfer? Alright thank you, will message you if anything goes wrong. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:10:15
Wish it took two days I was sat there on the day I was supposed to but never received an email apologising it’s late..
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:53:07
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:09:49
Nationwide 
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:10:26
3 weeks late as of Friday
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:11:01
It’s time to get these fucks taken down
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:07:19
Posted on Reddit and support came through on here, they said via phone and ticket support that specialists were looking into it. All lies.
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:53:39
Yeah they have said it’s completed which it’s not
@_date: 2018-03-05 15:55:34
That they refused to allow me to withdraw.
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:10:38
Yes and even confirmed with my own bank it was
@_date: 2018-02-10 10:32:52
How can I even take them to court they’d laugh me out of there
@_date: 2018-02-10 10:38:20
They just refuse to communicate and have no idea where my actual money is or when I can actually withdraw it..
@_date: 2018-02-10 10:30:36
@_date: 2018-07-06 14:48:11
I did in February when I started my withdraw process...
@_date: 2018-07-06 12:05:04
By the biggest app out there?
@_date: 2018-02-10 10:34:59
Let’s get it front page here everywhere..
@_date: 2018-07-06 18:38:01
Why are you even commenting lol
@_date: 2018-07-06 20:56:40
Because it’s my post lol, you’re not helping my post asks for suggestions 
@_date: 2018-07-06 14:47:56
Why would I be?
@_date: 2018-07-07 01:05:57
