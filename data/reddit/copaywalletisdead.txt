Nice article. I like that it starts out appearing to argue the opposite point of view.
As always, data &gt; opinion, and this article has data.

Because you don't want BCH users to sell their BCH?
BCH -&gt; BTC Lightning would be a good thing for Bitcoin. It effectively is onboarding BCH users to BTC lightning and letting BCH users sell their BCH.

Instead of blaming others for your problems, maybe you should ask yourself what you could do better.

The [Two Generals problem]( is the non-generalized version of Byzantine, which is more accessible if you are learning about this problem for the first time.
It is mathematically proven to be unsolvable.
is right. Bitcoin does not solve it.
There are no particular number of transaction confirmations that give you 100% certainty of no reversibility, which is what a solution of Byzantine requires.
The whole point of Byzantine is that it shows that 100% certainty is not possible.
Probabilistic solutions have existed since long before bitcoin (computer networks work after all!), and it is easy to come up with a probabilistic solution. For example. Just send 1000 messages. You can be confident the other general got the message if you know the channel loss rate is only say 10%, you don't even need to wait for acknowledgement in this trivial solution then.

I guess you don't math. I didn't say we want it, neither did the original redditor that you replied to.
We are simply telling you that Bitcoin doesn't contradict the Byzantine General's theorem or the 2-general theorem.

Lol, cryptocurrency was discovered after only ~1 decade of high bandwidth internet existing (which is a prerequisite to bitcoin, it's not likely to be discovered when everyone only has a 56k modem). A tiny amount of time on astronomical scales (billions of years) or even on technological progress scales (thousands of years). 
And look how many different cryptocurrencies have emerged in the last few years and how many different solutions to the problem there are now that a demand for this solution has been demonstrated? This is hardly an ultra difficult long standing problem like say the millennium prize problems are. This was a problem that not very many people made a serious effort to solve partly due to the limited amount of time that the requisite technologies for solving it even existed.
Also, Bitcoin doesn't solve Byzantine and nothing ever will as the problem as stated is proven to be unsolvable. Bitcoin provides yet another probabilistic solution of which there are many. Every lossy computer network (AKA *every* computer network) uses a probabilistic solution to the problem. A Byzantine solution specifically requires exactly 100% certainty of message receipt, which is impossible.
This subreddit is trash.

That coin has been around for years and has approximately 5% annual inflation.
Without someone (e.g. a government) forcing you to use such a currency, I doubt you would prefer to use a currency that is constantly losing value over one that it is not (e.g. Bitcoin).

Rounding causes money supply inflation to go to 0.

If you like forced ultra high fees (due to political reasons?) and no segwit support due to political reasons, and transactions from segwit addresses that are invisible until confirmed, then yes! ��

- They are charging 5-10x the necessary fee to get into the next 2 blocks. E.g. right now around 8 USD is "normal" priority for a 1 input 2 output transaction and $6 is "super economy", but $0.50 would be enough to get confirmed in 3-10 blocks. 
- They do nothing to adjust fees when sending to a segwit tx even though it should be cheaper.
- If someone sends you a segwit transaction with an unconfirmed parent it isn't visible in copay at all (looks like you received nothing!) until it has 1 confirm (you can't see it as an incoming transaction). 
- Their UI continues to be buggy on iOS (menu disappears, need to kill/restart app).
- They seem to have no plans to implement segwit. They had plans, but they were ***cancelled after community implemented it for them***.
