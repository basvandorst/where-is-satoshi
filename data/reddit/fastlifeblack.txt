This sounds about right. I deal in Forex and stock markets and observe this happening frequently. Look at what happens with the rate hikes of the various central banks.

"Auto-Invest" lol. No one will see their money back from any BTCJam loans because the interest rates are so unrealistic. It seems they are just trying to get as many investors to deposit as much money as possible so that they can probably hedge and invest it themselves. Just a theory. The website is no longer a viable solution for borrowers. 
The numbers don't lie. I checked the amount open listings two weeks ago, it was about 168. Last week it reduced to 112. Today, a little over 50. The loan listings have been cut in half because no one wants to use BTCJam anymore. 
They've committed suicide but it does seem fishy that they would be encouraging so many investors to deposit more money.

I'm not necessarily critiquing what you're saying but the whole "cheaper" argument never sat well with me. Artificial reasons are why the fees are in their current state. Once again, not disputing that L2 tech is needed. It just seems weird that we can pinpoint the exact reason why things arent cheap, but the same actors creating those reasons are using "cheaper" as an argument to push their agenda. 
Regardless of where everything goes, the fact that its obvious multiple bad actors are attempting to gain control of the bitcoin blockchain is a bad sign. Both crowds are right in concept, wrong in approach. Its selfish.

 Cheaper relative to what? Where they are today? Or where they were when bitcoin was stable?

It was. The only reason it was rejected was because the “Core” devs would have their power diluted with more stakeholders adding their input into Bitcoin’s direction. In the interest of keeping power they ran a campaign against it. Echo chambers gonna echo! 
“Supporters” will paint it to be about scaling and how 2mb blocks are too big for people with 56k internet and how hard drives are too small to support a blockchain that grows by 500gb a year. None of the reasons you’ll see make any sense. 
The only legitimate argument against it is the “what if we cant stop at 2mb” argument. Maybe 8mb actually is too much. But its widely known that 2mb wouldn’t have been an issue. A lot of people are waiting on a block size increase for their businesses and to avoid these ridiculous fees we’ve been paying. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:29:04
It’s a misleading comment that assumes a blocksize increase patently means infinite blocksize increases. It’s about finding a balance and it seems 1mb might not be the right balance or a solid enough foundation to begin off-chain scaling solutions with

Bitcoin is becoming the big banks' case study... They'll take all that blockchain research and use it for something more benficial. We all know Bitcoin is a threat to modern banking but blockchain tech can revolutionize it.

This whole “current tech” stuff has been propaganda from the beginning because it assumes technology doesnt develop over time. It also assumes that we currently dont sell hard drives that can handle the size of the blockchain
Both assumptions are grossly false. If lack of hard drive space is your current “reason” for thinking bigger blocks are bad, you’ve already lost the battle for decentralization
Funny how it started off as “lets leave the block size small so chinese miners with slow internet can download it and run a node”. Today the new excuse is “hard drives are too small and there will be no technological growth to keep up with the size of the blockchain”. Every year it’s a new excuse lol. 
Edit: didnt realize i nested this in another reply.  I agree with the guy above me!

So much truth to this. It’s become clear that there are children in the room.

I noticed this too. We may break $4,000 shortly but I see support there in the $3850 to $4000 range. 
I think $4k has been validated. We saw more buyers come into the market after that small bullish candle 2 weeks ago around $4k. At first it seemed there wasn't agreement on value but seeing those buyers pour in after 4k means something. Will 5k be the breaking point where this stops?

I cant trust any of these developers. Theyre not economists or business people. I’ll wait and see what happens. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 22:25:35
But yet we just had a whole scaling debate in which some parties argued that we cannot scale bitcoin because hard drives are too small. That happened. Apparently hard drive space and an alleged lack of advancement in that field was supremely important to people... Not economics. Hard drive space.

People will lose money because they choose to sit through this. This is the risk people take by holding and transacting bitcoin through this period of time coming up. 
The wallets have no control over the network. Blame this on the developers. The wallets have no responsibility but to follow the chain wth the longest POW be it 1mb or 2X. This isnt their fault. 
You haven’t explained what’s wrong with it because there is nothing wrong with it. Withdraw coins to a wallet where you control the private keys if you’re scared. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:21:13
/s ? 
@_date: 2017-10-03 04:01:27
How? It was dismissed as an alt movement. They rejected the NYA calling bitcoin “seg-witcoin”. 
That left “bitcoin” with two factions: people who only wanted segwit without the blocksize increase, and people who thought the blocksize increase was necessary and were willing to compromise on seg wit. 
So i dont think it violates the spirit of the NYA at all. Bitcoin got a chance to further the debate along by shedding people who opposed the whole compromise to begin with. That was the first hurdle to scaling for bitcoin. 
This is just the 2nd leg of a long scaling battle. We haven’t even touched the off-chain portion of things yet. 
Had BCH not been dismissed as an alt... some things would be different...
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:52:04
Im not even sure what point you’re arguing anymore but best of luck. Im not sure who “you” and “they” is. I want Bitcoin to go up and reach mass adoption too. I hold bitcoin. 
I don’t want to make my own coin. I want a coin that isnt subject to the whims of developers with the emotional intelligence of a 3rd grader. 
Its just an educated decision I made not to blindly follow internet developers like most people here do. You can follow these faux Bitcoin Jesuses if you want. I’ll just go wherever the money takes me. Hopefully things stabilize. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:45:04
Thats the point. Why are people so convinced that someday every county will use Bitcoin and not simply the tech under it for their own purposes? Isnt that what open source tech is about? If these state backed cryptos provide no value then people simply wont use them. But the state itself will NEVER relinquish that much control lol. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:23:14
100% Wrong. Signers of the NYA (supposedly) actively support Segwit, but only with a non-contentious hard fork, block size increase around November. 
BCH was dismissed as an altcoin and was largely a place for users who were completely opposed to Segregated Witness altogether. Thus BCH was NOT an “official” hard fork of bitcoin at all. Instead it was a minority movement. 
The official hard fork is up for debate as we are currently seeing

Point taken. In general i consider them a team in that those various developers work toward the same goal and do collaborate. Wouldnt the github be a reflection of that? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:14:47
And as of right now we don’t know which one is the altcoin. So... best protect yourself! 
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:26:55
Core is most definitely competent. I dont think thats ever been a problem. More collaboration and transparency are needed. 
Core isn’t the end all be all to Bitcoin’s progress and development. Some of us seem to revere the Core team as gods. We need collaboration between the developer, business, and mining communities. Whatever we’re doing is just bad press and a bad direction for the future of the protocol’s development. 
Meanwhile... I still have holdings lol 
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:28:08
Not all of them have. Some people who actually understand economics and business see potential in bitcoin. Its obvious none of these developers are capable of operating without bias. They’re all drunk off this newfound fame and have no plans of letting that power go. 
Why not have defacto checks and balances? Business use cases are obviously what will take this to the moon since we’ve abandoned the everyday user already. At the same time, businesses and miners, should understand developers hold the key to making dreams realities in this age. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 04:44:48
Agreed. I’m basically saying that these wallets cant help whats happening and to withdraw to a cold wallet. Its the developers faults. Not the wallets “responsibility” to protect coins. Its our responsibility to keep them safe. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:36:48
Exactly. So much garbage being spewed in this thread. People act as if No2x isnt just Core’s attempt to maintain control over the protocol after they lost it. 2x itself is an attempt by miners and other stakeholders to guide Bitcoin’s direction because they felt Core couldn’t be trusted. 
In all reality, an increase to 2mb won’t kill decentralization to the extent its being portrayed.
For anyone neutral, all you need to know is that it’s a dick measuring contest between developers. Everyone wants control and credit for Bitcoin’s success in the future. 
Anything you read here should ESPECIALLY be taken with a grain of salt. 
Try r/cryptocurrency or r/bitcoinmarkets to get more centrist (but still biased) views.
