Are you kidding? Gold is constantly pumped. Some people bought at $1800/oz due to all that pumping.

Yeah, until it started gaining in value, and then it became like every other altcoin with its own obnoxious promoters.

To be fair, not that many people hated the early internet in comparison to the number of people who hate Bitcoin. From what I remember, people mostly embraced the Internet because its benefits were obvious and exciting.

Is this what Dogecoiners actually believe? You know that bitcoins are finely divisible right?

Sounds kinky...

Ittay and Emin, thank you for providing a possible solution rather than gleefully declaring bitcoin's demise as you've done in the past.

Adoption and investment matters more than effectiveness in the long run.

Satoshi is long gone and is never coming back. But in the interest of discussion, If I were Satoshi, I would let the chips fall where they may. 
Actually, If I were Satoshi, I'd be on a beach somewhere with a bunch of supermodels and a lot of drugs, but that's just me.

I suppose those words didn't come out of his mouth, but he did apologize for security lapses. I updated my comment.

This entire thread is a great example of what's wrong with this subreddit. It's supposed to be a place where we can read about Bitcoin the technology, instead it's become a forum for heated political rants from hardcore ideologues.

We don't need commenters like this in this sub. Where are the moderators?

If the coins were stolen as that leaked document suggested, then they'll just circulate back into the economy.
If they're actually lost, that sucks for their rightful owners, but it doesn't hinder the operation of the currency. The remaining hundreds of trillions of satoshis just become a little more scarce and their value goes up.

I have a feeling that the people who say "investment is going into the infrastructure and not into bitcoin!" have probably placed their bets on an altcoin.

It is looking more and more like we will have to abandon the current POW algorithm in my opinion. We have been struggling with this centralization problem for so long and it doesn't look like it can be reined in by politely asking the miners to solve it themselves. Back to CPU mining!

That's a glib and cynical summary of a sincere and heartfelt comment.

It is important to note that most of those developers are on board with the Core scalability roadmap.

Oh I know all that. I'm thinking new algorithms on a continuous basis - perhaps every 6 months? Some time interval that makes investing in an ASIC solution unprofitable. Granted, that isn't a trivial problem to solve, but it is probably easier than hoping that the current mining situation improves on its own.
The idea would be that CPU (most likely GPU/FPGA) miners would be able to get back into mining if there is no reasonable threat from ASICs, and that would break up the cartels.

The XT sockpuppets are working overtime.

Yes, just like the 5 other times it bit the dust.

That's kind of tired and adds nothing to the discussion. The comic is making fun of projections based on a tiny data set. Unless you're suggesting that all forecasts based on any dataset are useless.

The authors are dickheads for deliberately lying about the implications of their attack ("bitcoin is fundamentally broken!!!"). What a way to stain their otherwise interesting research. Fuck those guys. 
The reality is that a weaker form of this attack (one without Sybil nodes) has been known for three years, the attack would be obvious after a day or two (if not earlier), and it would likely be stopped by other pool operators cooperating to stop the damage - just like they did during the Great Fork of 2013.

This isn't any ordinary financial instrument though. This is a technology that is following an S-curve adoption trend. Each new user demands a share of the limited number of units in the ledger, causing the price to rise. 
Of course there's a speculative component to that, but overall we should expect the price to reflect an S-curve. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:01:10
Please tell us what the fair value is for the fixed number of units in a globally distributed ledger that's undergoing S-curve adoption.

What? Litecoin is actually less efficient because there are no ASICs for it (yet).
