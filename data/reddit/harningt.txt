One method you could use is to make sure you have a long term storage key printed out with full details - both easy-to-import QR of private key, and the various forms of storage. 
However, if you are using Bitcoin over the years, loss of support wouldn't be immediate, nor would the market miss an opportunity to have converters arise. It would mean that some enterprising individuals could make a small business of writing and supporting data recovery tools for various formats. Shouldn't be hard for open-source systems (which is all you should ever consider for managing your own long term wallets)

New address every time you send. Sending coin from an address reveals the public key, which with quantum crypto methods, could be used to get the private key and spend anything in that address.
Many wallets offer this sort of behavior as a privacy protection, not necessarily as security...
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:33:47
That's effectively the same as what you have to do if you are using a cold wallet anyways:
 * prepare transaction using a tool that can create necessary details
 * copy to security media
 * load into cold storage system
 * sign transaction
 * store signed transaction on secure media
 * eventually broadcast
Now... The emergency account could be attacked, so you might want to protect it as well (more complicated since you don't have live data, but still doable). This method could be used to easily setup emergency transactions from hot -&gt; cold wallets, though.
@_date: 2013-04-20 01:43:19
A better solution would be to use a token/key api where the full power user credentials are not exposed to applications using the api. It also makes it easier to revoke application access in case there is any potential funny business going on.

Provide a reward to whoever can crack the ultimately difficult "vanity key"... Not so much like your typical vanity key with bits hanging, though.

I suppose this could be used and tie nicely with bitcoin addresses if ECDH capabilities are put in clients.

CampBX is pretty painless. If you have Dwolla, you can get in without additional verification (though with a few size limits, ex: $1000 daily cash in/out)
With verification, which I suppose would be faster than Mtgox due to size, limits go up and some cash in/out methods unlock.

A good way to have a synced wallet between multiple computers is to use a deterministic wallet, ex:  - BTW I'm working on an enhanced Android wallet that ties with Electrum -  (partner link for source tracking) - so if you have an android phone or tablet, you can sync there too :) ...

There are key schemes that take care of this change issue : BIP 0032 is one (the Electrum client supports / will support it soon) and the native Electrum one being used up until 1.9 of its client.
Armory also had is own derivation algorithm, but is planning on moving to BIP 0032 soon (if I recall right).
The way it works out is this:
You have a "seed" generated once and could back this up,  then you have all your addresses based on that. 
Need a new unique receive address - gets a generated one from the receiver chain.  Need change address,  you get one from the change chain. 
Lose your wallet data and need recovery - you go dig out that seed and import it: your client will then go through the transaction histories for addresses it can generate from the seed and eventually it will hit your unspent coins and eventually stop the process...  So only one single value to hold secret for backup :)

Yep, it is in my future road map for future releases.  Currently working on the graphical/system design of the 1st release. I anticipate once it is done, adding more features or forking specialized versions will be easier  (ex: version with Internet access excluded and less code compiled in to allow offline wallet activities assuming you use a tool to prepare the transaction using online / public data...  Makes for an interesting case for paper-wallet since the app could store nothing it gets key from QR code and transaction data via online QR transfer)

Agreed! How about someone create an OpenID service using Bitcoin addresses as the authentication means.
So say... I sign up with service (or download the source, should be open-source!) and get their url 
- i associate addresses from my various locations (including an in-safe backup one to recover my account if I lose others)
- I can then log into any site implementing OpenID using this Bitcoin address signature verification system... with any number of addresses I control that are associated
Given OpenID's extensibility, the provider could also optionally pass-through the authenticating address (if the user authorized it), so it could be used as a remittance address - reducing what details the relying party would need to collect at first login.
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:20:42
Ah! You don't need the private key on the GA just a pre-signed emergency transaction w/ a nice fee attached to make it tempting.
Downside of presigned - you'd need to update it each time you put a cold deposit, but lets the wallet remain cold in the interim.

Something I'd like to see is an integrated system where applications can leverage the storage like dropbox can on Android, where a developer can use a piece of code provided by Spideroak to get access to a folder of data while giving a unified user experience and keeping my code from seeing the authentication details. Only Spideroak would see these and act as a gateway to the storage.
Example use case:
 + user clicks sync button
 + app requests data access
 + spideroak sees no sync token, so presents UI to ask permissions for app to use storage
 + on success, redirect to Spideroak app to login/auth
 + finally app can read data and determine necessary operations to do sync
This would be a great future addition to my wallet project, alongside Dropbox as a recommended alternative. I've seen the web api available, but that requires I collect and store the password (an undesirable situation)

One could also use a letter w/ private key printed in shortform and/or QR code.
Could also make it "fancy" and do a colored note with a seal over the private key area...
Another protection that could be taken by seller (with some benefit to customer) is to only fund as soon as delivery confirmation made or perhaps a response message stating a specific code. That way the seller can claim additional protection and offer resend while losing no coin.
This of course could be abused, but would reflect badly in comments/ratings.

No fee = 10 min - days depending on # of paid transactions going through. Cumbersome, but something to live with when dealing with sub-penny values.
Suppose there may be a market for a micro-transaction wallet service that bundles up dust and makes it "clean" to send faster.
Ex: deposit address at service -&gt; collects
 * slowly bundles dust as received
 * small % cut taken to pay for server (less than std Bitcoin fee, fully based on input amount)
Request payout to some address:
 * service takes up bundled dust and sends it, keeping fee down low
Sound good? If desired, I could setup such a service... Allowing testnet coins if anyone wants to "play" with monopoly money until even better tested/trusted.
Could put the face on it that we accept small donations and make them more useful in an automated fashion. A bonus features could be to allow full mocro-transactions w/o fee if you pay some into an account you setup and I allocated micro amounts for later distribution to help many donation accepters.

sha256 wouldn't be the target - ECDSA would. However, if everybody only ever used a key once, then there'd be some level of difficulty in even finding what keypair to get the private key from.

One thing you could do - choose to do no fee, but expect slow transaction time. Another - after collecting a large amount of "dust" as these small amounts are called, create a feeless (or very low fee) transaction and send it to yourself to consolidate them in one "unspent" blob to send later using normal fee handling.

OpenID is quite decentralized... Just many sites are taking up mind-share with linked implementation. 
Perhaps a better model would be to use OpenID and someone produce a provider that they could possibly host, or you download to setup a private one of your own, with the authentication detail being that you use a Bitcoin signature to link your identity... This way you could potentially have multiple keys linked to you, but relying sites have no idea that you've made a backup of yourself. Pulls user management out of sites (no more password reset handling of whining) since it's now on their chosen OpenID provider - be it themselves or another party. A nice benefit is that users can delegate auth - have their **controlled** site point to the provider of choice.

There are local wallets that would behave as if online on that case, dynamically syncing due to deterministic key: Electrum, for one - see  and for a nice kickstarter (caveat - mine)  I'm working towards raising funds for developing a newer Android Electrum client.
So, benefit for you: one simple seed to share among your group and all spending is detected as well as all reciepts.

@_date: 2013-05-23 00:50:03
In a transaction there are from address(es) but these can easily mean nothing. What you really care is that someone paid you for X, so you need to get an address associated with X so you can send it to the person who ordered it. If 5 people happen to pay into the account, none of them the customer, no big deal.

Yes - it looks like things are going good now that it crossed the 100% barrier. If the LTC stretch goal is something you want, there's a voting mechanism to prioritize that before the other features (likewise it could be moved later if people vote everything else).
However... the voting system here only works if people don't pledge 9 BTC more (amount to pass all stretch goals). AND nobody comes up w/ a new stretch goal to meddle w/ priorities.

If all electrum servers go down you have a few options:

I definitely appreciate the ability to transfer directly one body of work by layering new UI code without having to port code.
I am thinking that having these projects both exist will be good - I'll have the disadvantage in terms of rewriting baseline Electrum mechanics in Java, however, the library that will grow due to this will be quite beneficial to the ecosystem.
My bet is that the library could end up tackling one item challenging for Java-based web shops that want to accept direct Bitcoin payment using MPK support.

Nope, there should not be loss. If the transaction is "lost" you can send it again, potentially adding a fee then if you want.
@_date: 2013-10-02 14:07:56
I think perhaps it's a simplification of things. Another possibility with client certificates - hardware tokens instead of browser/os "protected" storage. Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Safari offer means of using third party cryptographic modules, which may in fact result in the key being stored irretrievably on a token.
One minor caveat about client certificate authentication... currently it is very difficult to deal with multiple accounts - I have yet to find a 'sign out' button when using client certificate authentication.

The final project will be going on GitHub. At least until sometime in the release cycle (probably release candidate phase) - no source will be checked in there. It will be useful for tickets and the like.
Those who put up 1 BTC or more will get private access to a repository that I setup (not certain where, need to work out that detail once I find out how many hit that). This is per the "Electrum Count / Countess" pledge level.
Later in the release cycle, I will close the private repository and push it all to GitHub.
For people who contributed the various levels, I will send out archives of the sources as well as APK for ease-of-testing. Alpha access will of course come out first before those who get beta access... so the more you pay the earlier you get in on the actual source visibility.
I intend to keep the blog-to-date with process, however some design documents I may hold private within the pledge circle until release... when all will be revealed to everyone.
This sort of development certainly has some downsides... while rewarding those who contributed, it stunts my ability to accept contributions from the public at large.
@_date: 2013-07-23 23:44:58
I'll be working on an Electrum wallet for android with the features you are asking for in 
If you want early access or to take part in taking the project to its stretch goals, please contribute. Details outlining the stretch goals are currently at the project blog:  I hope to have the stretch goal details up tonight (waiting on manual update from Bitcoinstarter)
Regarding cloud - if you import the seed from the desktop Electrum client, then transactions will automatically be visible between the two. One of the stretch goals (not yet met) will also bring private label sync as well, so you can keep details about transactions, your addresses, and other people's addresses in sync.

The pin entry item defends against pure key loggers (such as those fun hardware-only ones that are nigh undetectable). If your threat model just contains these you're okay.

@_date: 2013-06-25 00:24:30
I'll get to the channel as soon as I can. I did hear about a Kivy UI being created atop the python system, but hadn't looked at it til now.
What sort of APK size are you looking at when building the in progress items? I've seen many apps quite bloated due to including compatibility layers like Kivy, especially games (but those are often space hogs anyways).
I intend on doing it 100% java, which has the side benefit that another language will have a useful Electrum API. I will also concentration on making it "light" in both resource and memory usage, so even phones stuck w/ 512mb user space can use it, while tablets can take advantage of the same app (and larger screen space)
If NFC is desired, it wouldn't be too hard to add, assuming there is a standard for this and BTC (haven't looked).
Another thing that I'm not sure such a layer would have is background service support so you could get pay notifications while having data honor the builtin android sync settings.

Just a note: I'm working on putting together a BitcoinStarter to fund my development of an open-source native android app that will work well as an android partner to the desktop Electrum client, likely including its label syncing. Look for "Electrum for Android - Native Edition". As soon as it is approved I'll post a link up to general locations.
I may also add Litecoin support if there is demand.
To transfer coins to it from a desktop client, you would either scan a QR code on your pc to easily get a targets address or you could import your desktop electrum client code by scanning the seed made available by the desktop.
Varying levels of wallet security would be offered: no pw (NOT recommended), pw every time private key used, pw on load, per-wallet security (multiple distinct wallets simultaneously supported), password caching w/ pin to unlock b4 usage but required the full password at least once at power-on. Will be welcome to any suggestions for security options!

For each transaction there is typically a small fee in sending the coin, ex: 0.001 BTC is common IIRR... Depends on the software preparing the transaction. Free transfers are possible, but may be indefinitely delayed or "lost" (effectively meaning it never left your "wallet")

I think I know where you're going here. On ex-ING's bank login, if you couldn't use a mouse to click your pins numbers, they offered a randomized alphabet layered over the numbers which when pressed, the page would effectually treat the letters as the numbers.
The virtual mini server brings another option possible: external hardware running secured operating system offering limited access to more fully featured client machine. You treat it like an HSM that stores your Bitcoin keys and ask it to sign transactions. It could offer its own UI or contact you out-of-band to authorize the transaction. Ex: SMS to predefined number expecting response to a challenge.
@_date: 2013-09-14 21:28:31

@_date: 2013-04-04 03:57:30
A good protection against potential client phishing causing major damage would be to setup a cold wallet that takes care of major amounts of btc. You'd set this client with a networkless setup such as Ubuntu Privacy Remix that even stops outside access at the driver layer - no hard drive / network access to leak your keys, just be careful w/ USB drive or whatever you use to persist the key. If you need btc out of cold storage, boot into cold storage, create transaction for sending to whatever, copy to USB stick, and perhaps verify contents of tx w/ other software... then use an online computer to send the tx to the world to enter the bockchain and get your coins moving.
@_date: 2013-07-24 07:09:18
Sure. The main difference is that this is a fresh implementation ground-up in Java/Dalvik - taylored more specifically towards Android native implementation. The other one starting up is leveraging the existing Python code-base and using the Kivy framework to setup UI.
I hope this ground-up implementation in Java can lead to a more lean system while leaving good room for feature development on top. This re-implementation in Java also leads to another venue for Bitcoin utilities to use the Electrum infrastructure.
Some of the design goals also include better native handling for alternate coins, wallet management systems (Electrum generator, BIP 0032 generator, imported keys), multiple wallet handling, fee management (Litecoin has recently made this more strict), and other server backends.
@_date: 2013-11-11 02:49:31
For the most part, converting makes no sense... At least until BIP32 or some other address system is adopted. Main issue is that Electrum and Armory use a key generation algorithm to keep private key management simple (just keep one value around)... Where BitcoinQT generates random keys as needed.  (not sure about multibit) 
On the other hand, there could be a tool to take any of these wallet files and send it to a new wallet... Perhaps even keeping all the amounts separate if anonymity is important.

The stretch goals will make it the first release(s). I intend to get it all in one release, but if, for *some* reason, a feature starts taking too long to do, I'll consider releasing a version without the feature and heavily prioritize it making the very next release.
Items not making it into the first release that have been voted on are likely to make it into a near-future release. (Ex: Label Sync, Online backup, enhanced BIP 32 support) However the timeline is much more uncertain. Also, any funders will have "votes" to use in re-prioritizing features at various points if the new feature-idea list gets to a certain point.
I do not think that I will need to start another BitcoinStarter campaign, however if there is some awesome feature that is desired and it is expected to take a long time to do on "free" time, then I may consider kicking one up. I envision that for such a starter, I may take a tier of the original BitcoinStarter funders (if the email address still remains valid) and tack them on as "free-loaders" with at the very least free Beta access...
For example, lets say I start a new fund-raiser, there would likely be the Beta / Alpha / Live code access groups. People who made it to the Alpha level will likely get direct access to Beta. People who made it to live code should make it to Alpha. People who also directly donate to the project may also get free access based on total amount donated... to track this I'll have to figure a better "donation" system then I have now.
Hm... will need to remember this content and re-post in a blog entry later on. :)

Yeah, I was seeing what sort of information could be passed around in their order system when experimenting.
When looking for an address to use for deposit, I picked the one most recent in the list since I had no reason to make a new one. The address should have indicated that it has some sort of "special property" to know that it shouldn't be used for deposit... though I had used it earlier to deposit...

If they weren't sufficiently random, then our non-vanity addresses are at severe risk.... As well as any sent coins since all normal transactions use ecdsa which requires a random value for each signature.
Pseudorandom number generators, such as provided by OpenSSL are quite good at what they do (aside from the patched version that was around a while ago, causing a security debacle)

Looking to see if it has had any prior transactions is a good 1st sanity check. There's no way to know about others who've chosen the same words or are watching.
As for setting up a watcher, there are services, but the most effective for such a trick would be to either customize a client and/or write scripts against the RPC interface.
@_date: 2013-07-01 03:31:39
I believe this has been cleared up. There are benefits of choice, and these are using different "native" terms. Where mine is in Native Java/Dalvik, the alternate version uses the Kivy framework that layers Python.
My implementation efforts also opens up a Java library that would have the capabilities to take advantage of Electrum mechanics.

If they got hacked, someone could put a Javascript update to send your coins automatically to the attacker's address or more dangerously, silently send your private keys so that future balances are at risk.

@_date: 2013-08-23 02:30:43
Well one issue is that there could be a few people in between a good "legal" transaction that identifies you and one that is somehow identified as illegal. Likewise with cash. If you pay someone for, let's say a beer at the bar and it in turn is used for an illegal copy of Duke Nukem Never... you should have zero liability since you didn't get involved in said transaction...  Just money that came to you through an identifying service and eventually ended up in a Duke sting. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 12:38:44
In your specific case, since you own the many small wallets, you could make a multi-source transaction to pull them into a larger wallet... or just let them sit until you need to buy something with them. Sure you'd lose 1 or 2 wallets worth, but at least you'd still be able to use your tiny amts.

That's suspicious, I've never seen CampBX charge in terms of BTC. Contact their support, they are pretty quick to tackle issues like this.

Electrum is like Armory in that regard. The one seed is all that is needed to generate all the addresses (change and receiving) that you'd need. 
You can just as well setup both a "hot" Internet-connected wallet and a cold storage with Electrum as well. There's details out there on how to do it... cannot recall at the moment.

No builtin date-specific items available yet in clients as far as I know. As for topping up, do you mean adding more BTC? If so, I just have the address stored in my client to send to as needed. For automatic stuff, you could set something up with a script on your local machine.

Awesome example project to show the power. Looks like I have a better tool to use now than trying to muck around w/ a google spreadsheet :)

Depends on the refund policy. They might tie refunds to the USD or other currency for value. Just as likely they could hold BTC which benefits them if value goes down. Without a statement on the site, you cannot be certain.

This wouldn't stop bots. It's pretty easy to handle client auth from a standard application.

If you use electrum backup is an easy 1 "seed" backup. And you don't why up w/ 9gb downloaded

Proprietary crypto == fail, gimme a backup and maybe internal phone data and I'll get yer keys.

Any idea when the game'll be up? Don't mean to be impatient, but looking for a good fun web-game to eat down-time :)

Unable to make a separate cake - wife'd kill me if I made another tempting cake in the house. So here's the weekend's bunch of cake at 1/4 age: 
Have a piece of chocolate, strawberry, or white (cup)cake.

Didn't realize coinbase had paper wallet generation.
Topically you'd want to use something offline to get a secured offline paper wallet, but if you plan on having coins in an online wallet, it would be beneficial to have a paper copy to sweep/import in case of the site going under.

Doesn't this one require entire block chain download? This is a major killer for most users... 8gb is a huge percent of most users' mobile data store.

Update: crossed 15.5 BTC, Label Sync added :) - ~1.1 BTC from Remote Backup

There is a paired hardware+software solution by intel that would get you what you want, wallets would need to integrate with the Intel IPT CSP to get pin protection where the input is directly through the hardware, preventing PIN sniping on the randomized digit layout. If interested I could go grab the youtube video on this.
Problem: this is for windows only a far as I know, so you'd have to contend with other fun malware that merely hooks into memory and reads your decrypted keys... Unless you can get them directly into the CSP (unlucky since the chosen EC curve that Bitcoin uses isn't on the MS list of curves).
Another option that could work is a smart card with ECDSA capabilities with the curve Bitcoin uses being supported. If available, I'd love to take a stab at writing support (crypto hardware interacting with software is my day job).
Def: CSP == Cryptographic Service Provider
