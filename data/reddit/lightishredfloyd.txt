My problem with coinbase is that to use Instant Buy I have to link a Visa CC, I only have MasterCard right now. Why is it limited like that?

You can just use the *send* function, and send it to the address of your other wallet.

The short version is basically that the daily supply of new bitcoin is going from 25 BTC per block to 12.5 BTC.
This is hard coded and has happened before. However, the last time it happened bitcoin wasn't on many people's radar so what exactly will happen to the price is unknown. There are some good guesses though.

I tried to buy $250 (minus fees) instantly with my debit card over a week ago. It has been pending since then. I got a response two days ago saying the engineering team was working on rectifying the issue, but so far no luck in either canceling or going through with my purchase.
In the meantime I've done a few instant buys from my bank account with no issues.

Not sure to be honest. I made my account back around the time BTC broke $1k. Never bought much, only recently added my card.

Gold leaf isn't terribly expensive, I wonder what the profit margin is on that. I'm sure the goblet and the fancy fruits cost a non insignificant amount, but even so.
