A service that keep/manage your private keys, can, want, will do anytime whatever they want with your identity, privacy and bitcoins. And in special they would love to follow the govs/"other parties" wish to close the access to your money. Not talking about other things.  
A service that do not keep/manage your private keys, but just have your full identity and xpub keys linked to it, will do the same as previous, but with the exception of seizing your money. But that is not their main goal. Their "existence" is more because the govs/"other parties" want to **control" you and your money.  
Keeping safe/apart from them your wallets, keys, txs, identity is just a nice way to say to all **fuck off from my money and my financial privacy**.  
Now, a sheeple would say, "hey, but I just want convenience, I don't care about privacy and stufff..." but that is just a sheeple that can't think for himself...  
Now, there are also other people that really fight for "regaining their privacy" and that is by using Bitcoin as it was designed: without any fucking intermediary.  
When we will have full independence of our own money from the state, then we can talk about democracy, freedom and stuff like that. Until then we are just a bunch of sheeple.  
Now, let's see how many people in the end wants to be sheeple.

I notice that when a "Bitcoin product" reaches a certain level of trust and usage, the scammers come up and make a phishing copy. That can be also a measuring tool or a "stars level" :)  
Good work Wasabi, you get the scammers attention! In so short time after launching, Wasabi wallet reached the "reconnaissance" of scammers as being a "milking cow".  
But I think they get it wrong (the scammers): usually the Wasabi users are advanced Bitcoin users and with an advanced "smell of scamming techniques", they will not get so easily fooled.

Is not a fake story, is a fake adoption. Using an intermediary to take BTC  is not adoption. Bitcoin was created exactly to avoid all these bloodsuckers intermediaries and we use Bitcoin exactly to get rid of them.  
Any intermediary for BTC payments is just another step back for full adoption. Intermediaries are pushing merchants to go back to fiat, instead of keeping BTC and putting them back into economy by paying with BTC. By just converting them for fiat, it's all for NOTHING...

When we will have a nice "combo" install pack for Electrum client + server?  
Right now normal users, noobs just install Electrum client and could get rekt. When they get rekt, come here to cry and we are recommending them to use Electrum Personal Server (EPS), but they get blocked because on electrum.org **there is no damn any good documentation about how to install your EPS**. So they will give up and sometimes they will just go to use Conbase...  
When normal users will have a simple install "exe" for both versions?  
User -&gt; click setup -&gt; install electrum client -&gt; setup is finished -&gt; user is asked "do you want to install EPS?" -&gt; user click yes -&gt; continue install (asking for more config parameters) -&gt; done.  
Right now there are tons of githubs and guides about EPS, ElectrumX, but **NONE** is complete or made for a normal user to be able to follow and install in good conditions an EPS.  
So please, fellow Electrum devs, or any other dev that is willing to make a simple setup for EPS, please do something, we will be forever in debt with you.  
All this "force upgrade" is meaningless if users cannot choose to connect to their own EPS. After every update will popup new scammers... Let's be sincere: any SPV wallet is damned to "trust" a 3rd party server. If you can't connect to your own node/server you are in danger.

Bitcoin is permissionless and borderless. That's why a real bitcoin wallet will never "ask" you to verify your identity.  
What you are talking about is NOT a BTC wallet, is just a bank/custodial wallet and you should never use one of those.  
Here are some wallets that respect the [Bitcoin golden rule](  
**Desktop Bitcoin Wallets**  
**1.Bitcoin Core**  
Pros= Great privacy and security  
Cons= UX is for more experienced users, takes ~week to sync and requires ~5GB minimum disk space if prunned  
  
**2.Wasabi - Best High Privacy**  
Pros= Best Privacy with Chaumian CoinJoin built in  
Cons= Fees slightly higher and slower to send due to mixing  
  
**3.Electrum**  
Pros= Great Desktop and Android wallet with advanced functionality like coin control  
Cons= UX is not as polished as some other wallets  
  
Pros= Great privacy and security  
Cons= UX is for more experienced users, takes ~week to sync and requires lots of GB  
  
**Mobile Wallets** (only segwit compatible matter)  
**1.Samourai Wallet**  
Pros- Advanced Privacy features  
Cons- UX suffers due to lack of Fiat value displayed  
  
  
**2.Electrum**  
Pros= Great Android wallet with advanced functionality like coin control  
Cons= UX is not as polished as some other wallets  
  
**3.Green address IOS/ Greenbits for Android**  
Pros- One of the better wallets for IOS. Features like multisig nLocktime for better security and 2FA not found in other wallets  
Cons- UX is not as polished as some other wallets  
  
  
**4.BRD Bitcoin wallet**  
  
**5.Mycelium wallet**  
  
**Bitcoin Lightning Wallets**  
[BTC LN wallet]( - send receive LN payments

A "wallet" service that ask you for an email/phone/ID **it is not a BTC wallet!**  
If you are asked to login with user/email and password, that place **is not keeping your bitcoins** and is not different than a bank.  
When you choose a wallet, the first rule is this   
The 2nd rule is; for what you will use that wallet (hodl, medium expenses, small expenses, testing).

I suggest a temporary solution, using docker for LN instance. In that way you can just backup the volume of that service every x min as you decide and you are more or less protected.  
yes, we are still on early days with these nodes, we need more tools. But it's a good start.

Your brain is the most incredible tool, that usually is used only 10% of capacity.  
Train your brain to memorize a seed.  
Using HW for storing keys and spending from them is not the "ultimate" safest way to use BTC.  
People should "act like a bank" when is about Bitcoin.  
Split your BTC stash into 3 categories:  
1. HODL, never touch it, long long time keeping - this can be easily just a seed, stored in many ways (brain, steel, paper, hidden in a text, hidden in a picture with steganography), you will never spend from this, so the xpub is enough to use for depositing into this wallet. You don't need to "open" the wallet to check your balance, just a look into a blockexplorer will be enough. I suggest to not abuse the refresh of blockexplorer checking your addresses every day. That will trigger an alarm on chainanalysis companies...  
2. Medium savings/spends - keep into an electrum wallet (for better coin control) your buffer between incoming BTC sums and other wallets. Is also a good ramp for using it with Wasabi wallet for anonymizing your coins. From Wasabi, split your "cleaned" coins into 3 parts: HODL, medium, small spends.  
3. Small spends - use mobile wallets, LN wallets to keep small sums of BTC, spread into different wallets, each one with a specific destination use.  
In this way you can keep all the time your cleaned coins into HODL, medium sums ready to be spread, small sums ready to be spend.  
HW are giving you quite false impression of safety.  
Consider using **steganography** to hide your seed if you really to not want to memorize your seed.  
This is an easy way to put your seed in plain sight and NOBODY knows about.  
[Example here](  
You could post that picture wherever you like and be able to recover it anytime.

There is no such thing of "bitcoin debit cards". Only fiat can be debited on cards. Those are fiat cards and have NOTHING to do with BTC, actually, using those shit cards, you are just giving up your freedom hardly regained with Bitcoin.  
Stop using those shit cards. Going back to fiat IS NOT the solution.  
If you have around merchants that accept BTC pay with your damn BTC wallet.  
If you do not have those ones, than pay with regular fiat cards and HODL your coins.  
**STOP feeding the banksters by using their worthless shit fiat!**

Some people would say "I don't want another machine in my house/shop", for those a hosted VPS would be a solution but nowadays they still have high prices.  
Let's recap and if somebody else have better solutions, please post them here.  
**Hosted VPS solution**:  
- 1 year hosted VPS with at least 300GB drive and 4GB memory would be 400 - 500€/year (taking in consideration full config with all node services). Sizing the hardware is very important for each needs.  
- Domain name another 100€/year.  
In total 1 VPS hosted, would be like 600€/year. In time due to increasing blockchain space, the cost will increase too.  
**Self hosted Node solution**:  
- 150-300€ node machine (depending on the configuration), one payment.  
- 20-30€/month internet connection (but it's supposed that you already have it already for personal use)  
- 5-10€/month public IP  
- electricity costs I think are too low to be taken in consideration.  
In total, self hosted node costs, would be max. 480€/year and you have the advantage of total control and manageability.

Just use protonmail and aliases. Gmail is the biggest spammer itself.  
  
Or use your own email domain + aliases.  
Create an alias for each junk web you subscribe or you are forced to give an email address. If they start spamming, just remove the alias and you will never receive any other spam.  
This also is good to see if one of your alias was leaked to spammers or phishing sites. The email header is giving you all the information you need.

Start being paid in BTC and forget about fiat.  
For example:  
1. open an account on Bitwage.com  
2. give your employer the bank acc number you get from Bitwage  
3. He pays your wage as usual in fiat USD, you get BTC in your wasabi wallet.  
4. Split that income in 2-3 destination new addresses/wallets, using wasabi coinjoin. Use 1 wallet for hodl, 1 for medium reserves, 1 for quick, regular, small expenses.  
5. Use as much as you can to pay with BTC/LN directly to merchants and keep a lower usage of fiat. Try asking your friends to pay for you in fiat (if you can't) and give them your BTC. This sounds like a sell of your BTC but in fact is not. It is a dump of fiat of your friend...

mexican laws don't allow you to send money from your bank account to a friend bank account? I don't believe that.  
Using Bisq is exactly this: 
1. you accept a sell/buy order from a pair in Bisq  
2. you get his bank details to send the amount  
3. you put the escrow guarantee in bisq multisig  
4. you make the bank transfer to your pair, with all the details  necessary, as a p2p transfer  
5. confirm the transfer in Bisq and wait for confirmation  
6. when your pair received the money in his bank, he releases the multisig escrow and you receive the btc.  
That's all. In any moment of this process your bank and pair's bank **DO NOT KNOW** it is a btc exchange between you and your pair. Don't be enough stupid to put in bank transfer comments the word "Bitcoin" or Bisq. Use **ONLY** the code/string provided in the Bisq trransaction,  
**There is no way a bank to know that you are using Bisq!**

Stay away from Conbase! You have been warned.  
For a store is just enough a simple mobile/tablet wallet, watch only for employees, full wallet for the owner.  
You keep your actual POS system as it is, just that when is about to take the payment with BTC, bring up the mobile wallet and generate the QR code with the amount from your sales ticket.  
That's it, no more complications.  
Here you have some wallets to have in consideration:  
**Desktop Bitcoin Wallets**
**1.Bitcoin Core**  
Pros= Great privacy and security  
Cons= UX is for more experienced users, takes ~week to sync and requires ~5GB minimum disk space if prunned  
  
**2.Wasabi - Best High Privacy**  
Pros= Best Privacy with Chaumian CoinJoin built in  
Cons= Fees slightly higher and slower to send due to mixing  
  
**3.Electrum**  
Pros= Great Desktop and Android wallet with advanced functionality like coin control  
Cons= UX is not as polished as some other wallets  
  
Pros= Great privacy and security  
Cons= UX is for more experienced users, takes ~week to sync and requires lots of GB  
  
**Mobile Wallets** (only segwit compatible matter)  
**1.Samourai Wallet**  
Pros- Advanced Privacy features  
Cons- UX suffers due to lack of Fiat value displayed  
  
  
**2.Electrum**  
Pros= Great Android wallet with advanced functionality like coin control  
Cons= UX is not as polished as some other wallets  
  
**3.Green address IOS/ Greenbits for Android**  
Pros- One of the better wallets for IOS. Features like multisig nLocktime for better security and 2FA not found in other wallets  
Cons- UX is not as polished as some other wallets  
  
  
**4.BRD Bitcoin wallet**  
  
**5.Mycelium wallet**  
  
**Bitcoin Lightning Wallets**  
[BTC LN wallet]( - send receive LN payments  
[Blue Wallet]( - send / receive LN payments  
[Zap LN wallet]( - only desktop version for now  
[Eclair LN only wallet]( - only send   
[RawTx LN wallet](  
[LND Thin wallet]( - IOS  
[LNwallet.io]( - **full custodial** LN wallet, send/receive BTC on LN using their serves

I hope somebody will create a mobile app for that...  
We have shitloads of stupid apps for TAs, portfolios BS and so on but not real usefull apps for spending easily our BTC.  
In your case, I think you can ask for an invoice from that rental company and pay the invoice with BTC through a service that pays bills with BTC. In US I know there is coinbills.com and coinsfer.com but their fees are quite high.  
Other pay your bills with BTC can be:  
 - pay bills - CA  
  
 - pay bills - EU  
 - pay bills - EU  
 - pay bills in PL   
 - pay bills, get wages - AUS  
 - pay bills, receive wages, recharge phones credit - PH  
 - pay bills etc - PH  
 - pay bills Thailand - TH  
 - AUS  
 - international

I will repeat it as others: BTCPay server, or NODL (their hardware implementation)  
  
  
Bitcoin wasn't created to go back to intermediaries, was created to give you sovereignity over YOUR MONEY. BTCPay and NODL offers you the tools to achieve that as a merchant.

Fellow mexicans, is time for you to use Bisq -  a P2P decentralized exchange, borderless, permissionless, open, control your money all the time.  
A bank can't prohibit you to send money P2P. If they dare do that, withdraw in cash all your money and close your bank account.

Maybe a more detailed documentation of how to use/configure/install that plugin would be necessary.  
For example from where the user can get the TLS certificate, macaroons etc.  
I usually see many projects on github that are poorly documented and that's why are not used. People give up when they see there is no good info on how to use it.

I think you don't know how Bitcoin works. adoption by all means is not the goal of Bitcoin.  
I understand your desire to compete in a capitalist way, but that doesn't mean that automatically you will achieve the freedom and privacy that Bitcoin can give you.  
Nowadays, the companies doesn't give a shit about capitalism and are just extorting your person for obtaining more data and sell it. YOU are the product and the meat.

mobile phones usually have to recharge after 1 day... the mobile cell towers also can run 1 day with batteries and then have to recharge, so saying that you can use Bitcoin without electricity is stupid, at least give details and say: " I can use Bitcoin for 1-2 days without electricity from power grid".

There's no such think of "Bitcoin tax". This is a fabricated term, to fool noobs and get scared.  
You are taxed (if you are fool enough) for your sales income, as usual in gov currency, your accounting is made in that currency NOT in BTC. You pay taxes in that currency NOT in BTC. You do not have to tell to your gov how much BTC you get, you show them your sales records in fiat currency. Based on that they tax you. Nothing more.

I am using it every fucking day. I am installing NODL/own made boxes with BTC+LN nodes+BTCPay servers to shops and merchants. And they are so happy to start using LN. Yes there are not yet so many customers paying with LN but if nobody will start, this technology will never go further.  
Just complaining is NOT a solution. Use it, report your issues to the devs, make it better. In time all things will be sorted out.  
I consider your post just a FUD against LN.

@_date: 2019-02-28 11:26:52
This sounds exactly like a propaganda from gov/bank/msm to scare people and keep them away to use Bisq, just because it is decentralized.  
The criminals will not use regular bank transfers to wash their activities. They will get caught before you will be able to trade with them.  
Even then, let's say you are right you get a criminal selling BTC to you, through Bisq. You use a bank account dedicated to this, depositing money into it enough to trade. What could go wrong? Nothing. You get your BTC. If the bank is blocking the tx, then you get back your money and the deposit for escrow. The criminal is the one that will get the trouble. If they ask you why you send them money, you just say: I trade online on Bisq, is NOT illegal.

Nope. We don't need to introduce more flaws and create  doors for bad actors that will do everything possible to get your keys.  
People should fucking understand: you lose your keys, you are fucked, point and clear. Get over it and learn to protect yourself. You are too idiot and can't do that, this is life, you lose.  
If you don't like it like that, you are free to fork yourself and create whatever BScoin with recovery protection.  
You can't keep your keys safe? Use a damn custodial wallet and be damned forever. But don't compromise the whole Bitcoin network because som bunch of idiots are not capable to do some basic security with their wallets.

I know how it works LN. I use it every fucking day, buying my coffee/beer/groceries.  
But in order to go to a store to pay with LN, I know that I need to have ready money in that "pocket LN" so I already have open channels. I will not stay in line opening channels with the merchant. If I already have an open channel with him, I just fund that channel again or use another ones. I can pay from fucking several channels.  
  **I just fucking pay instant**.

@_date: 2019-04-20 18:06:13
I suppose that is still on an exchange wallet.  
1. Install and open a new wallet with Wasabi (  
2. Send your BTC from exchange to the wasabi wallet  
3. Make a Coinjoin that will result in several UTXOs (outputs)  
4. Take the Wasabi wallet seed + passphrase and wrap it up into a [steganography]( hidden text into a digital picture    
5. Now you can keep that picture wherever you want: on a blog posted, on a digital frame on your desk, into your website, into your pictures album collection, into an usb drive with your holiday pics.  
Nobody will know where you keep your Bitcoin keys.

As a merchant that have your own LN node (strongly recommended) you just have to inform your customers that the fastest way and the best way to pay you and others with LN is to open a channel with your merchant node.

Why this obsession with paying taxes for your Bitcoin?  
I never paid any tax for my Bitcoin. From 2011 until today.  
I am paid in BTC, my salary is already taxed BEFORE i receive my BTC. Even if you receive your income in fiat and buy BTC, don't sell it, just use it as money. Nobody will be capable to say that you earn or not "capital" by doing that. That's insane.  
Why complicate things when are simple ?

The normal way is like this:  
- employer make the payroll, where is specified how much is the wage in total, how much are taxes and stuff to deduct, and the net what you really get.  
- employer, pays in your name the taxes and shit and give you the rest in whatever form you and him agreed.  
You can't be paid without having taxes deducted already.  
So paying AGAIN a tax for what you already received and taxed is DUMB and illegal.

What is doing Coinbase will do every fucking bank that want to survive: use Bitcoin to trace every movement a Bitcoin user will. They are building a huge chainalysis database interconnected, with every user.  
Coinbase is just an experiment, a pilot... don't forget who funded/created Coinbase... [BBVA a fucking bank]( )

As opose to all fiat world is offering you (almost nothing under 18), Bitcoin is **permissionless**. That means NOBODY can stop or impose you rules to use it.  
**ANYBODY** (no matter age, sex, location, culture, political view, or whatever you add) can use it. Just download a wallet, setup and done. You are good to go. NOBODY is asking you anything.  
REMEMBER THIS! Bitcoin = Be Your Own Bank  
Then here come my answer:  
**Desktop Bitcoin Wallets**
**1.Bitcoin Core**  
Pros= Great privacy and security  
Cons= UX is for more experienced users, takes ~week to sync and requires ~5GB minimum disk space if prunned  
  
**2.Wasabi - Best High Privacy**  
Pros= Best Privacy with Chaumian CoinJoin built in  
Cons= Fees slightly higher and slower to send due to mixing  
  
**3.Electrum**  
Pros= Great Desktop and Android wallet with advanced functionality like coin control  
Cons= UX is not as polished as some other wallets  
  
Pros= Great privacy and security  
Cons= UX is for more experienced users, takes ~week to sync and requires lots of GB  
  
**Mobile Wallets** (only segwit compatible matter)  
**1.Samourai Wallet**  
Pros- Advanced Privacy features  
Cons- UX suffers due to lack of Fiat value displayed  
  
  
**2.Electrum**  
Pros= Great Android wallet with advanced functionality like coin control  
Cons= UX is not as polished as some other wallets  
  
**3.Green address IOS/ Greenbits for Android**  
Pros- One of the better wallets for IOS. Features like multisig nLocktime for better security and 2FA not found in other wallets  
Cons- UX is not as polished as some other wallets  
  
  
**4.BRD Bitcoin wallet**  
  
**5.Mycelium wallet**  
  
**Bitcoin Lightning Wallets**  
[BTC LN wallet]( - send receive LN payments  
[Blue Wallet]( - send / receive LN payments  
[Zap LN wallet]( - only desktop version for now  
[Eclair LN only wallet]( - only send   
[RawTx LN wallet](  
[Shango full LN wallet](  
A good comparsion of LN wallets here:   
And also here: 
**Securing Larger amounts of Bitcoin (1k USD and more)**  
* [Ledger Nano S wallet = ~$59](  
* [Trezor one wallet = ~$95](  
* [Trezor Model T = ~$206](  
**Most Secure and Most Private hot wallet For Advanced Users**  
* Full Node + Hardware Wallet + Metal mnemonic Backup. This is typically done with [Electrum Personal Server]( + Hardware wallet (Ledger or trezor) + Electrum:  
  
  
**Other advanced multisig hardware wallet guides**  
  
**Testing different metal Backups**

Seller give me a ticket in fiat, where it says: coffee 1€, taxes 0.10€. I pay 1.1€ using BTC.

In the end they will just launch their shitcoin, because they will realize this:  
- they can't use Bitcoin, it's poison for them and they will not suicide.  
- the antidote for that poison will be to lie their clients about their bitcoin keys, something like Coinbase shit.  
- to survive they have to use their own shitcoin and promote it as "stablecoin" to fool again the dumb people  
- but they know that now many people will not take anymore their poisoned pill with lies and they can get caught in the middle.

Believe me, if you go with a Bitcoin banner in the middle of a protest that is there for any other reason than Bitcoin, the majority will look at you as an intruder and many will not even understand or want to know more about Bitcoin.  
Bitcoin is better to be promoted, peacefully, in silence, with friends, neighbors in a bar having a meet up and talking openly about money, finance, economy and ... Bitcoin. In that way they will get it much better and faster, and in the right way. Assimilating "Bitcoin knowledge" is a long process and is better to be slow because in this way users will be well educated in this matter.

All major crisis and shift changes into human history came with great sacrifices.  
Many people will lose, will became poor, will die (banksters suicide).  
But some, smart will just HODL. Is just about patience.  
I am not saying that in the future will not exist crooks that will lend you fake tokens copying the same shit system of fractional reserve. And many not well educated people will fall again into crooks trap. But you know what? Those "credit tokens" could be bought ONLY with BTC, because the crooks want hard money back and give to the fools easy money.  
So by HODLing today will save you a lot tomorrow when you could get some "credit tokens" for some satoshis... and build your dreams.  
Just think about it. And **always** remember: there will be no more than 21 million BTC in circulation (or less). ONLY! FOREVER!

Buy more. HODL  
Remember that Bitcoin is limited to 21 millions. So nobody can spend more than they have (like today banks did). So if somebody will sell/give you some BTC that person cannot spend more, until he buy again from other.  
So , for more you buy and HODL, for more the others will have less and less to sell.

I understand if you would use it just for you, without knowing about those issues. But going to "recommend" to others... is like you get a virus and you are going to spread it to everybody, because you didn't know that is harmful (the symptoms still didn't affect you, yet).  
If you keep it for you, it's your decision for yourself, but spreading the disease, then it's your responsibility.   
There are many implications regarding Coinbase and there are tons of posts here explaining why. You are not so new here, so it should be know.

Only online/custodial wallets can be "hacked", actually stealing the access inside or just the keys.  
I never heard about a mobile/desktop wallet app being hacked. I mean exactly cracking the code to enter/access user's wallet and move his coins.  
Is more about taking control of his device than taking control of his wallet app. Once a malware is placed, can read/send all the access to apps. But the code of the app it never get compromised. Is more user stupidity.  
Even then, let's assume a mobile wallet like BRD, the code gets cracked/compromised (like Copay wallet). OK in that moment nobody with brains will use it again, only ignorants.  
So saying "BRD was never been hacked" is meaningless for choosing a wallet. If it was hacked, will not be the subject here anymore, done. You will not come to say, "ok, was hacked once and the devs restored 20% of the funds, it's OK now to use it" - that's BULLSHIT.

It was more of a friendly advice. Anybody can give his opinion about Binance, but that will be never be 100% the real answer for an issue that matter ONLY for Binance.  
At least you can go to r/Binance and ask that specific case.  
People usually came here and ask about specific problems of companies and they confusing that r/Bitcoin is the support for all other companies in Bitcoin related world.  
Bitcoin itself is not responsible for what individuals or companies do.  
Yes you can come here and ask for advice about X company that launched a new product and you want an opinion of r/Bitcoin about that. Even then, don't take it 100% in consideration, take it just as an additional opinion. Do your own research.

What is doing Coinbase will do every fucking bank that want to survive: use Bitcoin to trace every movement a Bitcoin user will do. They are building a huge chainalysis database interconnected, with every user.

I really don't understand why so much hassle and paranoia when you have simple tools at hand?  
1. Save this page for offline use:   
2. Boot up an offline computer with TailsOS  
3. Run that page and generate your BIP39 seed, segwit, etc all you need.  
4. Save the seed and all necessary information on a paper, written down.  
5. Use steganography  to embed your seed into a nice picture (nobody will know that you have a seed in a picture).  
6. You can even put your nice picture file in a digital frame in your living room, online on a webpage, in a blog, send by email, store it on an encrypted USB.  
BIP39 seeds can be used in many wallets, anytime, anywhere.

Bitcoin is NOT a street revolution. Bitcoin is **silent revolution**, that sneak behind the backs of the banksters and when the time is right will strike with his Lighning bolt right into their heart.  
Usually (like french yellow vests) street manifestations are manipulated by paid instigators, mainly from LE itself, so they will have a reason to bring down any street peaceful manifestation... and enforce more drastical laws and regulation so next time you will not be able to even get out from your house. You are just playing their game.  
[Please watch this video]( that is observing the events with another eyes view. You never think that the "yellow vests" were framed/they stole their peaceful manifestation and convert it into "another" thing ?  
**Do you really want to fight?!**  
Take all your money from a bank, in cash, buy Bitcoin, use Bitcoin, HODL Bitcoin. Nobody can stop you doing this. If just 1% of population from each city will do this, **THEY ARE FUCKED!** because they do not have so much cash to give to the people, so their scam is revealed.

Your mind. Train your brain to memorize your seed.  
Everytime you want to use a wallet, instead of password/PIN, use your seed, open the wallet, do what you need to do, delete the wallet.  
You can use in this way any wallet app BIP39 compatible.  
There is no such thing of "most secure wallet". It's all about the level of security you execute over your devices you use with Bitcoin. If those devices are not secured, your wallets also are not secured. And that have nothing to do with the level of security of a wallet app.

People should stop trying to adapt Bitcoin to existing systems. That will not gonna work well.  
People should start adapt themselves to Bitcoin features and systems. Bitcoin will change dramatically the way we use, see things and systems. Bitcoin is a giant leap forward into human evolution, like was the fire for the caveman.  
Bitcoin, having limited supply, it will make people to save more their money, not spending on stupid things, like they do now, with shitload of credits of fake money. Yes this sounds very crazy and drastic, because people after many decades of impulsive economic system of debt, they can't imagine a world where people **can literally save money for future use**.  
All this HODL thing have an important reason: save your money for later use, not because "keep your bitcoin/don't sell for fiat for when the price will rise".  
HODL is "save your money for your kids future", when they will need to start a business, buy a house, a car or pay for good studies. You should ask your grandfathers how was back in their times, 80-100 years ago.. or even more back.  
The actual credit system is **TOXIC**! Is a perpetuate debt slavery, not just for you, but for your future generations.  
Get rid of all your debts, BUY BITCOIN today, every day/month, HODL, use it as money if you can and wait. Let the sheeple break their necks with forever debts. Then your children will have a wonderful future, guaranteed.

@_date: 2019-01-21 23:04:23
No and yes.  
No - if you plan to just have a node sitting in your house and just using your restricted data plan. You are almost not helping too much the network with that. A node will need also upload bandwidth and that will affect faster your data plan. some providers do not allow too much. And if your connection is also slow, can create other problems.  
Yes - if you plan to use your node **for your privacy and security**. Then build your own node or buy one that is already build plug &amp; play and use it with your wallets to connect. That will not just help the network but also yourself. A protected bitcoin user is a good participant of the network. A bad protected user of the network could affect others also.  
I suggest you to go further: BTC node + LN node + BTCPay server (if you run an online business) + Electrum server.  
Here you have some options:  
[Casa BTC &amp; LN node]( - plug &amp; play  
[NODL BTC + LN + BTCPay node]( - plug &amp; play  
[BTCPi]( plug &amp; play

Sometimes I think he's doing it on purpose to create controversial topics. It's actually a good way to obtain more information from a negative aspect and then fix an issue.  
Here is the original tweet that OP didn't wanted to post:

Any other wallet (that respect [the golden rule]( is much much better than that shithole bank coinbase...  
I strongly suggest to use Wasabi wallet to "clean" your coins from Coinbase, before putting them on any other wallet. In this way you lose any tracking from their side.  
And yes, BTD is safe to use.  
Here you have also some others to take in consideration:  
**Desktop Bitcoin Wallets**  
**1.Bitcoin Core**  
Pros= Great privacy and security  
Cons= UX is for more experienced users, takes ~week to sync and requires ~5GB minimum disk space if prunned  
  
**2.Wasabi - Best High Privacy**  
Pros= Best Privacy with Chaumian CoinJoin built in  
Cons= Fees slightly higher and slower to send due to mixing  
  
**3.Electrum**  
Pros= Great Desktop and Android wallet with advanced functionality like coin control  
Cons= UX is not as polished as some other wallets  
  
Pros= Great privacy and security  
Cons= UX is for more experienced users, takes ~week to sync and requires lots of GB  
  
**Mobile Wallets** (only segwit compatible matter)  
**1.Samourai Wallet**  
Pros- Advanced Privacy features  
Cons- UX suffers due to lack of Fiat value displayed  
  
  
**2.Electrum**  
Pros= Great Android wallet with advanced functionality like coin control  
Cons= UX is not as polished as some other wallets  
  
**3.Green address IOS/ Greenbits for Android**  
Pros- One of the better wallets for IOS. Features like multisig nLocktime for better security and 2FA not found in other wallets  
Cons- UX is not as polished as some other wallets  
  
  
**Lightning Wallets**  
[BTC LN wallet]( - send receive LN payments  
[Blue Wallet]( - send / receive LN payments  
[Zap LN wallet]( - only desktop version for now  
[Eclair LN only wallet]( - only send   
[RawTx LN wallet](  
[Shango full LN wallet](  
A good comparsion of LN wallets here: 
Securing Larger amounts of Bitcoin (1k USD and more)  
ledger nano S wallet = ~59 USD  
  
trezor one wallet = ~95 USD  
  
Trezor Model T = ~206 USD  
  
Most Secure and Most Private hot wallet For Advanced Users.  
Full Node + Hardware Wallet + Metal mnemonic Backup.  
This is Typically done with Electrum Personal Server + Hardware wallet(Ledger or trezor) + Electrum  
  
  
  
Other advanced multisig hardware wallet guides-  
  
Testing different metal Backups -

It's closing the circle, not going out into fiat world.  
1.You are not selling your btc for fiat in order to buy stuff, you are paying with you btc to the merchant  
2. merchant do not convert his btc received from you, is using them to pay his employees or suppliers  
3. if none of the parts are exchanging btc to fiat, there is no such volume for trading/speculating, that means price will stabilize in a normal levels  
You and the merchant you are not speculators, you are just 2 parts that want to trade goods and services and using a p2p currency.  
**The whole key is to close the circle, stay on Bitcoin, not go back to fiat**

I just did a CoinJoin tx on Wasabi wallet, good luck with tracing my addresses &amp; me.  
All these "articles" are published only to fool the noobs to scary them of "do not use BTC because you will be tracked anyway". Is not like that.

BISQ   
How many times we have to repeat this here?  
It's decentralized, P2P, behind TOR, no verification bullshit, escrow service, you control your money, no wash trades, permisionless, borderless, open.  
**What do you want more for Satoshi's sake?**
@_date: 2019-01-23 15:51:46
Yeah, people usually forget this beautiful warning of Andreas, is not only about forks, is also how Bitcoin is attacked in many ways:

Banks will break their neck anyway with Bitcoin. So no, this is not a reason to chear up. Is just BS crap.  
Bitcoin has it's own way to do things, no need for banks and/or "regulations".

It's make a sense only for sheeple. All these intermediaries are just another way to fool people to still use fiat, the slavery money. Banks can control the world only by letting them to control the monetary supply. Once we take that power from their hands are out!  
**Satoshi took the power of creating/controlling money supply from the bankers and give it to the people. We have the duty to continue his work and do not let that power from our hands!**

Every time I see "invest in Bitcoin", I see a real dumb person that don't even bother to read more about what really is Bitcoin.  
Let's be clear:  
- Bitcoin is not stock, bonds, shares, hedge fund, shit like that **STOP doing that, it's stupid!**  
- Bitcoin is NOT a company or holding, it's decentralized protocol  
- Bitcoin is pure P2P money, it's a money protocol  
- Bitcoin can be used as store of value, for its scarcity  
- you are NOT "investing" in Bitcoin, you can say that you are investing in your **freedom**, you buy Bitcoin to secure your future  
- for more time you HODL, more will increase his value  
- for more you spend it as money, more will slow down the volatility  
- don't try to adapt Bitcoin as existing systems, means, habits. It will not work. Try to adapt YOU, your thinking, your systems, your values, your habits to Bitcoin's way it is.

We should make a page with "hall of shame" of all companies and services that do that.  
So we can start from this tweet.  
Wallets/exchanges **that do not send to full segwit address bc1**:  
1. Bitmex exchange  
2. Jaxx wallet  
3. Bitstamp exchange  
4. Cash app (I don't know what really is...)  
5. Gemini exchange  
6. Coinbase?
Who else you know more?

It's a feature not a bug. Bisq is decentralized, doesn't have a ton of paid shills to promote it everywhere or a marketing department to generate endless spam news on all blogs and shit.  
It's just grow naturally, once people discover it and understand what really means.
@_date: 2019-01-19 15:58:35
Privacy and freedom is priceless, don't you think?
@_date: 2019-01-19 20:36:34
You forget one important thing:  
- VISA can ban a merchant or a payer to use their system, because they want that or "somebody" else told them to do that. In order to use VISA, you need "approval"...    
- Bitcoin is censorship resistant and permissionless

Please, if you use any centralized exchange/service for buying BTC, use Wasabi wallet to "clean" those coins. For Satoshi's sake, it's about your privacy.  
And **before you start downloading it** check if in your country is available:  don't give up all your info for nothing...  
Just to be clear... for EU for example, the whole process is through Conify exchange.  
  
Once you finish the registration for buying BTC through Abra...  


Coinify will send you an email with instructions on your next steps.  
So again another steps for registering and giving even more information....
I am not saying don't use this service, but at least read all the details BEFORE you start the process so you will know what you expect.
