I don't see how the bitcoin community can possibly survive after so many bitcoin holders have had their coins stolen.  Each time this happens, there's a ralley cry about how the bad actors have been weeded out an now everything is ok.  It's probably impossible to find out who the culprit is,  but with the bad blood towards mtgox and Karpeles it's easy to speculate that the theifs could well be respected member's of the bitcoin community.  How can a financial network survive that's potentially run by theives?  I guess the only solace is that whoever stole the mtgox coins will end up holding worthless collections of bits.  If something isn't done,  I will be supporting US legislation to ban the trade of bitcoins to hopefully save others from the same fate.

I have read multiple new sources quoting insiders saying that "The MTGox theft is good for bitcoin".   This is, of course, completly absurd.  If left un-addressed,  the theft will set bitcoin back for years if not destroy it completely.
This whole situation is analgous to a flaw being found in the Windows operating system,  Microsoft reporting that "efforts are underway" to fix the issue,  then  _years_ after the discovery,  Microsoft blaming an application designer for not implementing a work around.
Some how, everyone has drunk the koolaid that the primary bitcoin developers are blameless in their blatent disregard for an un-addressed security flaw as they point the finger downstream at an (albiet somewhat incompetant) developer without in the slightest acknowledgement of their complete disregard for a known critical issue.
This is good for bitcoin?  Wake up already!
