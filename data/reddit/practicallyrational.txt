We could set up a donation fund, fueled by profits from selling BCC, to buy mining contracts in order to boost the price for long enough for the smarter ones to get out... who, with their thin air money may buy more mining contracts.
I have seen things happen that make less sense. I started by mining dogecoin. It's a beautiful thing when a community materializes out of common goals. Even if that goal is to be filthy rich based on a system that's more bot driven and fickle than reddit politics.

I bought and mined fake internet money. 
Dude's definitely heading to a meeting. 
He's probably the hacker known as 4chan, off to make another meme about the Panama papers and then dress up like an underage male prostitute in order to get access to more local copies of political party databases.

If by worse you mean more entertaining... 
Also, that guy is probably not a surgeon but it does look like he's goin to have to get scrubbed in for surgery.

I've been known to have altogether too elaborate sounding plans right off the cuff which makes it seem like I'm prepared and have put serious thought into things I have no idea about. 
Want to invade Canada? Drive up the price of potato imports and start a high end french fry manufacturing company. If there's not a national universal poutine day, invent one. Undercut all other fry providers and then start horning in on the gravy market. Figure out the exact timing to put a 2 part laxative in the fries and the gravy. Boom, you can have half the population cleaning out their turd whistles like a freight train being flung out a dam sediment chute. 
Wait for the first flush and then attack.

rollerblades. Skateboard. One of the 27 pieces of wheeled luggage this person has somehow gotten on the train. 
maybe if you were really good at heelys, or stole a kid's scooter. 
Otherwise you need to be really good at tumbling and then somersaulting out of the roll while producing doves that aren't dead from inside your coat. 
You could take off your shoes and lather your socks up with dish soap, have a seltzer sprayer or a gallon jug of water with a hole in the cap.... spray water where your feet.... nvm. You should just strap a cut water bottle to the bottom of your shoes and then slide like a swan landing on ice.

This is exactly the same argument made against Bitcoin super recently. It's devoid of merit.
