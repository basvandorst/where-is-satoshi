 that's the screenshot of what the app looks like. I can go to transaction details but I'm not sure if that's sensitive info or not

Well, update: I attempted to regain access and mycelium seemed to work a lot better than electrum, however, now it shows the amount I expected to import in there in red and available balance as 0.  Does anyone have any idea of what happened? I have the hashes of the incoming outgoing transactions if that means anything

I get that a recovery seed is all important, but I do not understand how punching it into mycelium and electrum can just lead to me losing it all. Are these not upstanding websites?

I made sure I downloaded the approved by Google apps

So what does the red mean then?

And how long would it usually take to clear the transaction?

Okay so next question: would it be prohibitvley risky to contract all this out because honestly I don't understand any of this. I'm on a roadtrip, driving thru all 48states and still have to go down south. If someone was willing to meet up IRL to help me access it again as well as show me how to turn it into cold hard cash,I'd obviously pay them for their troubles. Is that a bad idea? I know there are a lot of bad actors and scammers,but I'm sure there's a way to make it somewhat safe

TAILS,  like the operating system?

Won't I need access to a desktop computer? All I have Is a tablet and cellphone with me

So essentially my best plan of action would be to buy a new trezor,and then recover from seed thru their database?  I tried electrum and it wouldn't accept the 24word seed
