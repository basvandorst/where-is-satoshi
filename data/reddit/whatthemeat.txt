Thanks for the reply - will they process the transaction? Live chat last night said they will send a refund but I'd rather just have my order shipped!
@_date: 2015-06-30 23:31:20
Spank you very much! :D

I couldn't get the amazon gift card option to work and it said to contact purse.io for help... but then the contact button was not working.
Can anyone explain how to successfully convert amazon gift cards to BTC?

So here's another stupid question for you - is the password in step  listed above the private key?
@_date: 2014-07-30 15:28:23
Again many thanks for the detailed response.  I think I am finally understanding the "why" behind all of these steps and will absolutely try out the paper wallets. 
Another response which I received in another thread that I found helpful was that I should begin by transferring very small amounts to and from paper wallets, different online wallets, etc. to become familiar and confident with the entire process.

I found a site called BetMoose that I think has huge potential and can possibly avoid any legal action because it calls itself a "prediction market."  Anybody can host a bet and earn commission without even wagering.
@_date: 2014-07-18 01:17:43
Good luck, I believe this is just the beginning...

The idea of a "reputation economy" has been stuck in my mind ever since I first heard of the concept.  Do you know of any good resources that propose these systems in depth?
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:02:51
And yet another dumb question: assume I figured out the answer to the trivia question and know the password - how do I go about actually sweeping the funds? Scan the QR code on the right with an online wallet app?
@_date: 2014-06-27 23:50:21
Am I too late?
@_date: 2014-07-30 14:07:22
Wow thank you so much for your detailed response!  This seems quite straightforward and simple - however I guess the part that I found confusing about other "walkthroughs" is that they all stress that in order to be secure the paper wallet must be generated on a device that has never been connected to the internet? And I read something about having to install a linux file on one thumbdrive and saving the wallet to a second thumb drive?  
I guess if you (or any other redditors) could just comment on how secure your above recommended method is despite the fact that it uses an internet connected device, I would feel much more comfortable going through this process.  Thanks again, really appreciate the help!  It is this kind of hand-holding that will truly help the masses adopt BTC :)
@_date: 2014-07-28 19:41:03
Awesome news!
@_date: 2015-05-01 20:12:40
Maybe I'm missing something but in practice, CAN bitcoin be regulated? It started out as a free market experiment and I have yet to see how regulators could effectively stop it. 
Surely governments can make laws about businesses that accept bitcoin but in the end most markets are shifting to P2P anyways... 
@_date: 2014-07-30 15:46:31
Ahh very helpful, I think I understand now.  So in order for anyone to be able to access the funds they must have both the private key (which only exists on the paper wallet itself) AND know the password that I select - correct?
I have no idea on the movie trivia and my Google-fu is off right now so I'm sure some smarter redditor will claim your prize in no time!  Thanks again for your patience!

Lots of good news on this Tuesday, so of course the price is down :)
@_date: 2015-05-28 03:17:00
Can you elaborate? Is that just a leveraged volatility tracker?
@_date: 2014-07-30 05:12:45
Could you possibly help me through the paper wallet process? I just placed an order with Coinbase today and was planning to keep it in the new vault feature but I'd rather use a paper wallet. Except all of the resources I've seen are still a bit too technical for my comfort level
@_date: 2015-05-02 00:49:23
On the Point of Sale page, at the bottom section titled "Trusted by over 39,000 merchants" - I'd recommend inserting the logos for the companies listed.  They will be immediately recognizable and provide credibility.

Errybody in the (21m) club get tipsy
@_date: 2015-07-14 15:52:07
Exactly, but maybe OP should start spending BTC as well (assuming he doesn't already) and replenishing BTC with his fiat earnings
@_date: 2015-07-04 21:34:45
Not only that, but Augur acts as a market so anyone who places a "bet" can also cash out before the event occurs
@_date: 2015-07-19 16:57:32
Eh don't worry about the vocal minority that represents "the crowd."  Start with your friends and family and let it grow organically.

But in all seriousness, tipping seems so mundane now but in retrospect it is pretty magical that you can send money to anyone anywhere in the world through a discussion forum comment! Imagine telling someone that even 5 years ago, they would think you were crazy

Andreas is the man.  I can only imagine how many lightbulbs go off in people's heads every time he speaks

@_date: 2015-04-21 05:02:44
I could not agree more... How can we help make this happen? I would move there in a heartbeat

How do you plan to capture those non-cryptonerd users?  Just curious because I really love the site BetMoose but they do NOTHING to promote it and attract users, meaning most "bets" don't even get off the ground
@_date: 2015-04-27 01:04:32
Thank you sir. Will be used on my BitLendingClub account!

If you believed in bitcoin back in 2011, then why aren't you rich?

I like that description. It's too early to tell exactly what type(s) of transaction units, but in essence it is a new way to transact
