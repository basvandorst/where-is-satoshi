Um, I think you may have put the decimal point in the wrong place. You should have got about $100M valuation for Maidsafe using that math.
Also take into account that some MSAFE coins won't be released until many years in the future, so the near-term market cap is actually lower.

I'm surprised nobody has posted this wired article about him:

It's now been more than a year since I wrote this. Still believe it though!
I did a self post to reddit when I originally wrote this, which I'll link here:

Some people (including me) got punished for incorrectly estimating supply and demand. That's different from a pump-and-dump.
As a Mastercoin insider, I would have made huge bank on an actual pump-and-dump. Unfortunately, I didn't see the massive demand for Maidsafe coins coming, and I missed out on this opportunity entirely.
The whole fundraiser was over in 5 hours. 5 HOURS! All that is left is some MSAFE coins purchased by maidsafe themselves specifically for bitcoin investors, which are being processed manually.
I wrote a lot more about this on another reddit thread here: 
edit: 
Maidsafe now has a press release out about the crowdsale: 
@_date: 2014-06-03 19:26:37
These crowdsales are built on top of bitcoin and will accept bitcoin and mastercoin. It's big news for bitcoin (and probably bigger news for Mastercoin)
@_date: 2014-01-21 18:54:46
Nice to finally see some mention of distributed consensus systems being built on top of bitcoin in the mainstream press!

Mastercoin founder here. The fundraiser closed 5 hours after it opened. 5 HOURS!! They have a bit left which they bought themselves and reserved for bitcoin investors, but the fundraiser in the Master Protocol was manually closed 5 hours after it opened.
I don't think anybody expected it to sell out so fast. I was going to buy some using my own Mastercoins, but I got none. Zero. I was sleeping when the fundraiser opened, and still sleeping when it closed.
There should be some official communications about this soon, but here are a couple early descriptions of what happened:
From David Irvine of Maidsafe:
From me (including some tasty quotes from me where I hilariously underestimate how quickly they would sell out):
I know everybody involved is doing their best to make sure we do right by everyone, including making allowances for people who purchased MSC for the express purpose of buying MaidsafeCoin. On that topic David Johnston said: "If you have MSC and wanted MSAFE shoot me a PM I got more than expected because of the bonus and so I can help a few people out (I'm not charging any fee, I just want to support the community members who believe in this project)" (
While supplies last :)
Note: most Mastercoin and Maidsafe people were up all night long, so many people are sleeping now. Forgive us if we are slow to respond to your questions!
One thing we have definitely proved - it's possible to raise a crap-ton of money really fast using the Master Protocol!

Hal has always been my  candidate for who Satoshi is.
When Satoshi first decided to withdraw from his involvement with bitcoin, I thought to myself that only a really serious illness or family problem could cause me to make a decision like that if I were in his shoes.
Later, I heard about Hal's health problems, and I put 2 and 2 together.
I've launched a couple crypto projects myself - they are my babies and it would take something REALLY serious (like impending death) before I would abandon them.

Removing volatility is my biggest concern. It's the one thing that bitcoin can't do in its current form. I talk about how to do this at length in the paper, which I linked to above.
The memes are just an attempt to explain what I am trying to do and why I want to do it. The paper is supposed to explain how I want to to do it. 
Thanks everyone for the helpful comments. It seems I should have used a different font! 
This saga has taken an amusing twist. The internet, whom I designed this presentation for, doesn't seem very interested in these ideas. On the other hand, the big companies in the mobile phone space, whom I was afraid would think the presentation silly and unprofessional, are taking it very seriously. Go figure!

@_date: 2012-06-26 22:56:16
Yeah, I guess you could cut out some of the slides and have something like that.
I didn't want to give the idea that bitcoin is perfect as it is now, since there is still a lot of work to be done and problems to be solved. I wanted to present the massive potential of bitcoin, the problems we are facing which prevent widespread adoption, and let people know that the problems are being worked on. 
If some of them want to read my whitepaper to see how I want to solve those problems, that's nice too.
@_date: 2012-06-17 02:54:35
Dang. Communications fail on my part then. It was supposed to be easy to understand :(
The idea was to explain bitcoin's awesome potential, explain why it hasn't taken over the world yet, summarize my proposed solution, and point people to the white paper if they are interested in learning more. Any tips on how to improve the message?

You can't lie about how much of a child currency you have any more than you can lie about how many bitcoins you have. The network has a list of who owns what, just like with bitcoin.

Yes. The area of each circle is determined first, where each pixel is $100M, then I calculated the diameter of the circle from that.
There are some gotchas with assumptions about what could actually move to bitcoin. For instance, Forex transactions undoubtedly often include the same money being moved repeatedly. I didn't even include futures or options, even though they are a huge bubble of money too. The problem is that their face value is not a good indication of how much money would move into bitcoin if those derivatives move. Draw your own bubbles for those :)
There are also considerations on the bitcoin side, such as the fact that some bitcoins are lost, and many are held by people with no intention of selling them.
@_date: 2012-06-26 23:00:47
Well, everybody has a different take on what bitcoin could do, I guess.
Love the bitcoin magazine, btw. You guys really did an awesome job on that.
@_date: 2012-06-17 03:53:57
Good point. (The above comment is referring to the whitepaper). I should add a couple examples to the paper of how that would work. 
Basically, you can think of the tiny transactions as being representative of the higher-level transaction being published. For instance, I might send 0.00000023 BTC followed by 0.00000061 BTC to a specific bitcoin address, representing that I have 23.61 of some currency for sale.

@_date: 2012-06-26 23:25:30
It would be foolish to assume anything close to ALL of the money would move into bitcoin, except maybe in the very distant future. I like to start out by guessing what percentage of each bubble might eventually move. Everybody will have their own number at the end, I imagine. 
I'd be interested to hear people hazard their guesses on the percentages and final number.

I have spent the last few months writing and editing a document which I am ambitiously calling "The Second Bitcoin Whitepaper".
Today is my birthday, so I took the day off work to do some final polishing and to publish it for public comment.
Here it is: 
The paper calls for a "trusted entity" to hold funds, hire developers, and probably make a lot of money for themselves. (Read more about it in the whitepaper.) The most important feedback I need from the bitcoin community is who that entity should be.
What company, person, or group of people do you consider most trustworthy to play this role?
I'm headed out soon to celebrate my birthday and finally publishing this, but I have a few minutes to answer questions before then.

The arrows represent money moving from the giant bubbles of trillians of dollars as they are sucked into the black hole of bitcoin :)
I used the memes because I figured they were the most basic possible form of internet communication. The opposite of the audience the whitepaper was targeting.

Turns out that $100 in pennies is a lot more expensive to process than a $100 bill. In our 4.5 years running bitcoin ATMs we saw an average transaction size of $500. We (Coinme/Coinstar) are doing only paper money so we can offer 4% fees (versus typical bitcoin ATM fees of 10% or more)

MasterCoin (new protocol layer being built on top of bitcoin) has something called a "savings wallet" for exactly this situation. If somebody puts a gun to your head, and you transfer everything to them, you have a way to "undo" that transaction due to a waiting period for transferring out of savings wallets.
Of course, that feature isn't implemented yet. Sorry, we're working as fast as we can!

I won't be doing that, but if someone else forks my source code and implements it on LiteCoin, I wouldn't try to stop them.

Bitcoin has proof of work to secure the network, which I don't need to do. The other way to get bitcoins is to buy them, which is how you get MasterCoins

Well, somebody has to sell the initial new coins, but they don't need to continue to exist after that (although they probably would).
Once the new open source protocol is in the wild, it can be maintained and modified by anyone, but the entity which got things rolling would have a big incentive to stay involved.
Bitcoin would continue even if Gavin and the bitcoin foundation were all thrown in jail. However, having the foundation around is nice until then. It's a similar level of centralization, but with more explicit incentives.
Your edit is correct. I proposed a central "trusted entity" to kick things off.
@_date: 2013-08-05 16:14:34

Miners can include transactions or not include them. However, MasterCoin transactions don't look any different from normal transactions. I suppose miners could get together and collude to not include any MasterCoin transactions, but I don't know why they would do that - we'll be paying fees like everyone else.

MasterCoin is just as distributed as bitcoin, although thin clients have to trust servers (like electrum does)

Obviously these methods of trading are just temporary. The point of the coding contest is to do a decentralized exchange, after all.

I suppose you could look at it that way, but to my knowledge, nobody else is attempting what this protocol is designed to do.
@_date: 2013-06-06 15:18:26
My next step will be a full technical spec. Not sure if that will happen before or after crowd-funding. However, a technical spec is not required to see the potential of what could be done with a message-based protocol layer.
Distributed exchange, distributed betting, and user-created stable currencies are not a niche - they are a big step in the direction that the whole bitcoin bandwagon is headed. This may start out as a side-show, but I believe that someday it will be the main attraction.
@_date: 2013-10-25 23:50:47
Here's my best shot at it:
@_date: 2013-06-05 20:37:38
Yes. Except by collecting bitcoin investments directly, I can have the new protocol recognize the addresses that invested as holding the new "coins" on the new protocol layer. I can't do that with bitcoinstarter.
@_date: 2013-06-05 18:52:48
The distributed exchange is only between distributed currencies built on top of the new protocol layer. This is not another attempt to bridge bitcoin to fiat. Does that help?
Also, read the paper :)

Yeah, I was actually hoping someone else would do this so I could just be an investor (see the youtube video where I actually offered to invest if someone would just try this).

Kickstarter wouldn't take a project like this (collecting investments is against their TOS).
I would use coinfunder if I had a target I needed to raise, but I don't. More money helps the work go faster, but I'll be working on this no matter how much is raised.
Also, this method lets me have traceability in the block chain of who funded the project, and therefore owns MasterCoins.

Well . . . 
Ripple is centralized and not built on bitcoin, but I have the same goal of eventually providing users with stable decentralized currency. They need trusted issuers, but my goal is to trust only the math of the protocol.
Zerocoin adds anonymity, which is not my goal (anything I build will be exactly as pseudo-anonymous as bitcoin is), but like me they are building on top of bitcoin - just in a very different way.

The betting market is distributed, not closed. If I were the counter-party, I would probably get thrown in jail.
I'm creating the protocol, but I disavow responsibility for how people use it!
@_date: 2013-06-05 18:30:27
I think a good analogy is the personal computer. You don't have to understand the complexities of how electrons move over tiny distances on a silicon wafer in order to use a PC. Similarly, a complex protocol layer on top of bitcoin does not need to add complexity to the end-user experience. The final goal of the additional complexity is for a simpler, safer user experience for people using decentralized currencies. 
For instance, the ability to store and spend tokens which track the value external things like US Dollars without trusting a central issuer is one big goal at the end of the feature road-map.

I'm not proposing an alt coin. I'm proposing building on top of bitcoin, so I think we are in sync there :)

I've asked the main armory developer, Alan Reiner, to comment on this thread about whether he thinks armory offline users should worry about this virus (or ones like it) and whether a different method of offline signing should be used.

MasterCoin is a scam which rapes the block chain!!!
Just figured I'd post it first before someone else does. :)
MasterCoin is my project. This was a really fun interview. Thanks Adam!
@_date: 2013-04-01 20:38:16
Wonderful! I've been listening all day.
May I suggest:
* When bitcoin values are rising: distant train whistle
* When bitcoin values are dropping: distant foghorn
They could be more frequent and/or louder when things are moving faster, crossing major thresholds ($100!), reaching new highs/lows for the day/week/month and I think it would blend nicely with the other sounds. 
Also, I agree with others here who think that the tone should be chosen based on the size of the bubble :)
@_date: 2013-10-25 20:14:36
We're creating a distributed bitcoin/mastercoin exchange. If you want U.S. Dollars, you'll have to cash out bitcoins.
To my knowledge, nobody has ever done a distributed exchange among two distributed currencies, so we're breaking new ground here, even though we're not solving that ancient bitcoin problem of how to interface with fiat.
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:47:59
Nobody beats Vitalik when it comes to in-depth write-ups on bitcoin tech. I had heard he was researching MasterCoin, and I was hoping, hoping, hoping we'd see an article from him :)
Here's hoping we merit an article in the print edition at some point!
@_date: 2013-08-01 02:34:36
Yes, it is my sincere hope that people funding this project now will have the vast majority of the coins when it is done.

This proposal is stirring up a lot of controversy!

My comment on this article posted in Wow. That's . . . really negative.
Here's the comment I posted on that site:






do have a weakness if they become under-funded. However, that is only one of three ways which Mastercoin creates stabilized currencies. The other two are user-backed currencies and contracts-for-difference




@_date: 2013-10-25 19:44:35
You forgot the part about where people who sent money to the Exodus address made more than 10x on their investment. Among high-risk investors, that's called a "ten bagger", and it doesn't happen very often.
Also, we're just getting started. This contest is for only the second major chunk of work out of several.
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:16:07
Also, note that the arguments above are no less valid today!
@_date: 2013-04-19 22:25:42
That whitepaper never fails to be controversial :)
The trusted entity isn't actually necessary - it is just a nice construct (like the bitcoin foundation, actually) to keep things moving.
@_date: 2013-10-25 19:35:37
Um, what? Nobody controls the protocol in a centralized way. I think you misunderstand how it works.
We've been accused of being parasitic, but I believe we are more symbiotic than parasitic, since a successful MasterCoin project raises the value of bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-06-06 00:53:07
That sounds really cool.
Actually, the new coins on a new protocol layer have a lot more properties - they are not just ownership.
I'm trying to use the metaphor of selling one kind of currency to gain another one rather than equity, as I don't want to attract the attention of the SEC.

I'm kind of a bitcoin snob when it comes to alt coins. That said, I expect I will eventually be partnering with other developers to make this happen. I do plan on staying on the bitcoin chain though.
@_date: 2013-10-25 19:26:51
This coding contest is just about the distributed exchange portion. After that comes smart property, then distributed betting. Eventually we'll get to the escrow-backed coins you are talking about, but that's a long way in the future yet.
And yes, I believe they will work. Government currency pegs typically fail due to trying to simultaneously control interest rates along with exchange rates, which creates the black market due to arbitrage opportunities. This is called the "impossible trinity". We've got no interest rates in our system.
Still, I agree that it hasn't been proven to work. Only way to find out is to try it :)
@_date: 2013-06-05 18:41:51
Yes. A good analogy is the Bitcoin Foundation. I just want a way to crowd-fund and pay developers of an open-source project. 
I think it's healthy for the "trusted entity" to have a small stake in the protocol which vests over time, as that aligns their interests with the interests of the early adopters.
@_date: 2013-08-01 02:10:45
I will purchase MasterCoins exactly once, and you can watch the coins in the block chain to make sure they don't leave the Exodus Address.
@_date: 2013-04-19 23:11:17
Heh. I mostly agree with you. I actually have a lot of positive things to say about bitcoin, but other people are already saying them :)

Sweet mother of bacon. Maybe I should warn you that my talking isn't as good as my writing!

I used to be annoyed by spiral_mind, but I've learned to love him. I believe his posts have actually helped my project more than hurt it. For instance, he bumped my project thread a bajillion times when it first launched, making it really hard for the community to ignore. Also, other people don't bother to criticize my project because they don't want to be associated with him :)
When somebody like Mike Hearn or Peter Todd or killerstorm criticizes what I'm doing (and they have), that's scary to me, and I pay close attention to everything they say. spiral_mind is completely harmless, or even slightly beneficial.
@_date: 2013-10-04 16:59:07
Yeah, plus I don't want that much attention from the gov't right now. I'd rather fly under the radar for awhile while we build up some momentum.
Also, I'm not sure I want to be the guy who goes down in history as opening that can of worms (distributed e-commerce would be impossible to control, so you'd have drugs, assassins, and anything else you can dream up)
@_date: 2013-10-04 19:38:45
Yeah, that's why I didn't say we would NEVER do it. It's inevitable that someone will, so MasterCoin will probably eventually set itself up to profit from that inevitability rather than expose itself to a major fork. 
I just don't particularly relish the idea. We'll pursue the big features which have obvious legal uses first, and we'll want to come up with some legal use cases for decentralized e-commerce before we implement it. Any ideas on that? 
@_date: 2013-08-01 15:57:36
Hey Alex, 
Did you see my reply on bitcointalk? Anyway, I have thought about some ways these long-term issues could be handled. People might have said the same thing about bitcoin a couple years ago.
@_date: 2013-08-01 00:35:19
I expect I will be the biggest investor (I'm holding back my coins for now so that people don't complain about my getting the best exchange rate by buying right away).
I do get some additional MasterCoins which slowly vest over time. In theory, this should help make people feel comfortable that I'm not just doing a pump-and-dump.
Regarding the number of active chips, do you mean how many MasterCoins are purchased per bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-02-07 23:01:11
killerstorm posted this in the bitcoin forum, and I'm really excited to see what comes out of it.
@_date: 2013-10-17 23:32:51
That's . . . a surprisingly good synopsis of how our project works.
I'd use the word symbiotic rather than parasitic, since I believe we'll be good for bitcoin in the long run. History will decide, I guess.

The Exodus Address was just for the fund-raising portion of the project. I could throw away the keys to that address, and the protocol would still work just fine.
MasterCoin inherits decentralization from bitcoin. Thin clients lose some decentralization since they have to trust a server, but full clients are exactly as decentralized as bitcoin is.
@_date: 2013-07-31 20:11:22
A pre-mine can be spent at any time, but those coins can't be spent until some time in the future. 
I wanted a way that people could be comfortable that my financial interests were aligned with theirs.
I'll also be purchasing a large number of MasterCoins myself, of course.
@_date: 2013-07-31 23:53:09
Any suggestions?
@_date: 2013-04-19 22:42:04

Demand for new currencies would be in proportion to how much people wanted the new features they bring. Being able to hold and spend tokens which track the value of external things like gold and US Dollars is the biggest eventual use-case.
In the meantime, I think distributed betting could get really big right away - person A publishes data into the block chain (like a stock price or sports score) and persons B and C bet on it.
Really, the features of a new protocol layer are limited only by imagination - any data or protocol you can imagine could be stored in the block chain. My paper outlines a bunch of possibilities, and we'd probably do the simplest ones first.

I can't find the post in question, but I don't think btc is a Ponzi, and would never say that. I'm very bullish on btc long-term, which is why I'm building on it instead of making yet another alt coin.

MasterCoin inherits decentralization from bitcoin. I'm raising money kickstarter-style to work on development, but I don't have any centralized control over how people use this protocol.
