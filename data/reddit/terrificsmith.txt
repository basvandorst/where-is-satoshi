Any deposit holding institution can run fractional reserves based upon client withdrawal/deposit patterns.
Nothing about bitcoin makes this harder. If you make a deposit in any format, that bitcoin no longer exists. It's been replaced with a token for whatever you deposited with.
Same as if someone sent you bitcoin for safekeeping. Their bitcoin no longer exists, all they have is a promise to be paid bitcoin from you at a future point.  The existence of that future bitcoin relies solely upon your ability to meet that request.

An economics degree is essentially propaganda for the status quo.
Throughout the four years it was never suggested that there could be negatives to Keynesian fiscal policy or low rate monetary targeting. The goal was the understand them and nothing more.
At best they'll teach you why previous policies were worse.

This is silly. Printing money is a tax, while it's the least visible tax available, there are still plenty of methods for funding wars that are almost equally invisible.
Payroll taxes could be raised to any amount, you could tax corporations based on transaction volume, you could require banks give you a certain proportion of loan interest revenue, require all participants in the construction industry build a certain proportion of buildings on government owned land.
None of these would piss off the general public enough to rebel, and would enable perpetual warfare just as easily.

The majority of people earning 2% for doing nothing are also those who'd jump at the chance of earning 30% for doing nothing.

As a transexual blockchain CEO, I find it laughable that you believe yourself 'oppressed'. You benefit from white supremacist CIS patriarchy and should step back and listen instead of forcing yourself into the conversation.

Yeah, bailing out the people who gambled with retirement money is the best solution to the above.
Not wanting to do so puts Grandma at risk, you wouldn't want Grandma on the street eating cats would you? Stupid libertarians.

Pretty easy to convince people who've been educated by propaganda, especially when they desperately want to not be mistaken for one of those "uneducated rednecks" they always hear about.

"Printing debts away" at best is a regressive tax on the middle class, and at worst is a stepping stone towards economic collapse.

Deleting the posts of people for any reason is censorship- you happening to agree with the censorship because it improves your personal user experience doesn't change the fact that it's censorship.

Blockchain technologies are incredibly inefficient. For a decentralized network of people specifically aiming for a lack of market manipulation this may be worth it.
For a financial player it's insanity. A database with an externally facing data display would achieve "transparency" at a fraction of the cost.

These are very good questions.
They claimed the topic was being censored and the person who posted the topic got banned.
They called you "cowards", which I assume is based on the fact that you banned them preventing them from responding to your accusations.
They said you were "talking shit" about them after banning them, which I guess this exact message is what they are referencing.
They said they are having people trying to talk to them and they cannot respond, which I think is explicitly true since you banned them.
They called Bitcoin "god-awful", which is an opinion.
They then stated their opinion was that you personally were a loser, potentially because you enacted petty revenge using the very limited scope of power you've been granted and then shit talked the person you censored when they were unable to respond.
Not sure which of these were lies, but as to why they are saying these lies- maybe because they are an alien, or a dog, or are actually a 2 dimensional invader from a presumably 2 dimensional dimension.

Bitcoin isn't being operated, it's a decentralized mechanism which is specifically built so that it cannot (without gigantic effort) be operated in the smallest of degrees.
The same is true for almost all currencies actually. The $50 in your wallet cannot be magically converted to $20 just because a cashier happened to hand you the wrong note 2 weeks ago.
Dollars are not made instantly meaningless due to specific instances of fraud, and yet that happens every day. The only real issue is when counterfeit notes start circulating en masse, something both the government and bitcoin are equally successful at preventing.

Okay, so you're a bank, and you get $100 from A.
You lend 80% of that to B.
B buys gold from C.
C deposits $80 into their bank account.
You then lend $65 dollars to D.
You've now loaned $145 despite only $100 actually existing.
This happens because any money lent out that is the result, at any stage, of borrowing, causes additional money to be created.

If person A earns $100 from the government that prints the money and hands it to them, and then A puts it into their bank account,
and then the bank lends it to B. B then purchases gold from C, and C puts it into their bank.
The end result is:
A owed $100.
B owes $100.
C owed $100.
$100 deposited
The bank has now received a shiny new $100 from a person completely unrelated to A, and so lends it to D.
D then buys chocolate from E. E buys paper from F. F buys chicken feet from G.
G then deposits the money into their account.
Final result is:
A owed $100.
B owes $100.
C owed $100.
D owes $100
G owed $100
$100 deposited
Now do this 10 times.
Final result:
10x people owing $100
10x people owed $100
$100 deposited
From that single $100 ten people believe themselves able to receive $100 from the bank. $900 has been created.

Not really...
Transactions occur when demand and supply intersect. Those intersections determine price.
The price of a market with zero supply is equal to the bid price with an asterix (a comment that the true price is uncertain and likely higher).
The price of a market with zero demand is equal to the put price with an asterix (a comment that the true price is uncertain and likely higher).
Both scenarios you suggested aren't just impractical, they're impossible as nothing can be practically worthless and still have a market, and nothing can be practically infinitely valuable.
If it was true you'd be able to make any unique item infinitely valuable simply by trading it once and then refusing to trade it ever again.
The longer a market goes without any demand supply interactions (and thus transactions) the larger the uncertainty about price becomes up to the point where a market no longer exists.

Don't make the car payment, car starts up, drives itself to the creditor. If you're in the car it starts blaring an alarm "telling everyone you're a poor" until you get out.

Polls about specific issues are meaningless.
Not only are pollsters specialists at getting whatever answer they want, but polls can completely misrepresent a persons feelings even without specific malice.
The order of questions, phrasing, word choice. All of these can completely invert the answers.
Not to mention that the majority of people are ignorant about the majority of subjects.
But even putting that all aside. The only opinions that really matter are those that people will fight to defend or switch their vote for. Everything else is meaningless fluff.
If 99% of people answer a poll that the sky is blue, and the next day a politician declares their 'The Sky is Red' policy to absolutely no effect, then what possible use was that poll? What possible use is the meaningless whining of someone pointing to that poll?
People may believe it, but all that counts is if they truly care.

Most people don't understand even the most basic aspects of how money works.
They go to the store and swipe their credit card, accepting whatever arbitrary price is offered to them.

So volume spiked around the ATH frenzy, then halved to be roughly stable at 2x what it was before the spike.
Shouldn't there be a downward trend if 'adoption' was falling rather than a sudden rise and fall in line with a speculative trading period?

How does this work in your brain exactly?
Do you imagine society as some kind of regularly meeting round-table with perfect knowledge and foresight, who vote on matters of fairness and equity?
We're chaotic ants, pushed imperfectly by culture, law, and happenstance.


So get-rich-quick schemes **do** work but not for everyone, or will society disallow ass sitters from getting-rich-quick? Two opposing thoughts are alive and well inside your head.
