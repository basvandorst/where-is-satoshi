I own a lot of domains related to bitcoin dust and fluff.  I'm hoping to do something that involves adding a lot of data in small chunks at the Satoshi level for micro transactions. I don't want to be "the guy" that bloated the blockchain. 
Your scalability work is really interesting. Thanks for doing it.

Math!, Bitches.

That's been my experience as well.  I gifted a few people some BTC and half of them have pissed it down their leg.

I would love a commercial for a bitcoin Exchange that had some NASA crew handing out moonboots and helmets.  Superbowl 2015?

I used Stripe as my payment processor for my online business. I'd love it if Stripe integrated this.

Reality is also a factor.  A lot of bitcoin "people" are reproductive age people with responsibilities.
Even if you knew the game was rigged and you could triple your input, the rent still has to be paid, and the car fixed, not to mention Junior's braces.
You can't go all in as a responsible adult really.  I've got a house move coming up in July.  I would love to drop more than half my income monthly on BTC honestly, but I have to hedge for "what if".  
So I put in as much as I can possible bear and still put fiat in my moving fund.  Does it kill me to have 20BTC sitting in a fiat account depreciating? Of course.  But it's responsible.

Yup.  My current holdings = Beach house down payment.  If it jumps up to $3k+ per coin, then that's an entire beach house.
Let's hope.

This. All in also.
@_date: 2014-03-24 17:28:26
I suspect it'll either be $1200 per, or 10-50k per. No middle.
I just bought the last of my investment coin this morning.  I personally believe  we won't see $500 coin ever again after next month.

Exactly.  I work in finance/wall St./Hedge funds all day and the amount of activity happening behind the scenes in bitcoin is staggering.
These guys aren't your uncle Cletus. They know how to not spook a market and get in cheap in a big way.  
I personally just finished my buys for the year this morning now that it's so inexpensive.

That's the reason I moved my BTC off BTC-E. I got to thinking that why wouldn't someone on the backside of the database just hack a few accounts. You could blame anything you want. 
No accountability at all.  If I want to trade I'll move it in, do my trades, and move back out. I'm not trading actively at this time though so no sweat keeping my coins cold.
The main reason I kept them hot was so I could quickly move them into an exchange in case of a crash.  Now that we're probably looking at a long up trend it's not a priority.

Take your spam somewhere else.
@_date: 2014-03-27 01:47:22
Or just email Coinbase and ask them. It's just dudes at desks.

I'm planning on 3k per in June. Fall back to 1200-1500 for late summer, with a jump to 4500-5k for November.
I've got it at $10-15k for Spring of '15.  We shall see.

Good luck!

They don't have mine. They just needed my bank account number,  username and password.  I set up a separate account just for purchases.

Once you start moving a lot of btc you get lazy.  When you're moving a lot around it's easy to have a cached copy/paste string.
I used windows as a vm inside a Linux front end so am constantly copy/paste strings between OS.  
I've been lucky so far.
When I move coin around I usually move a small test amount, then the wad.  
I've worked with systems too much to believe they don't just crap out and not work sometimes.

My parents aren't even 60yo yet and I've already had to start masking all the "complicated" buttons on the cable remote.  
These are reasonably normal, capable adults here. 
Until they can buy things by pointing their cell phone at something and clicking the "buy" button on the phone, crypto is going to be scary.

Really informative.

Their site is suspended.  Seems like they aren't going to sell much.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:25:17
Just FYI. Shopify will shut your store down if they see "bitcoin" anything on it.  Non reviewable judgement also.
This was as of two days ago.  Shut my buddy's store down for accepting bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:06:00
That's really informative.  Thanks for that.  
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:47:26
Agreed. I'm trying to plow USD into btc and it's bitch.  
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:34:10
There are several bitcoin trusts as well. I'd contact them and just do a bulk sell for a cashier check.  Probably your cheapest option.
You can also contact coinbase directly.  They are just people.  You can set up a bulk sell through them and negotiate a fee.  When you're a major player you can do things the little guys can't, and take advantage of special pricing, etc.
Most of the advice you'll get here is by regular Joes and they're regular guy mind set.  Ask for special service from the big boys and you'll most likely get it.

I run a large kiteboarding dealership online.  I'm about to start accepting bitcoin.  You think coin forest is the way to promote?
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:07:19
Yeah. My friend opened his site and store and shopify shut him down.  If you try to buy anything it errors out. They sent him a cease and desist too.
I have a reasonably large store on shopify selling kitesurfing equipment and never had any problems but there were not having bitcoin.  This was a week ago.
 if you want to check it out.
