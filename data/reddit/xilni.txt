I'm getting an SSL error while trying to load the page. Is it down for everyone? 
Regardless, what's this about?

I'll never forget you and your gentle manner.

As I mentioned, C++ is used by the reference client which is a really good place to start asides from C++ being a great language to know regardless.

A good start for you:

Couldn't find anything on Xapo though they're on LinkedIn if you fancy that.
Also [bitcoind]( which many tools use, is written in C++ so there's that.

I've been waiting for weeks for the invite to come through.

Ooops, yes of course. Sorry I've never used changetip before.

Exactly, the beauty of bitcoin as I see it is you don't have to rely on anyone in particular.
@_date: 2014-07-17 14:01:54
Oh ok. I was worried I was just really unlucky since I hadn't really heard anything about it. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 22:16:50
Seconded, I've heard too many horror stories of people selling their bitcoins elsewhere and getting screwed over when the payment was reversed even after escrow and yet the bitcoin transaction is irreversible.

A good start are these:

Small thought, this will drastically increase your bandwidth usage as well as introduce quite a bit of latency when it has to request and verify the block from the other server.

BTCTattoo^R , get your seed tattooed on you:

[Bitcoin vs. The NSA’s Quantum Computer] (
TL,DR: [ECDSA]( which is used for signing transactions would fall to quantum computers but the protocol allows for easily switching to something else new.

Yes, move your bitcoin out of Electrum immediately. Changetip it all to me and I'll keep it safe for you until after earthquake hits again.
@_date: 2014-07-20 19:45:02
What is a good client that accepts multi-sig wallets? I use electrum and haven't seen any of the new features I keep hearing about. 
Electrum is extremely light on features in retrospect.
@_date: 2014-07-16 22:24:15
Wow, thanks, I have now forever labeled you appropriately.
Now that I've lost it, I must find a way to whore myself for more Changetip.

Can someone please ELI12 this?

Because bitcoin like any other currency (usd, eur, gbp, jpy, etc...) are only of any value because they are accepted in exchange for services or debts (hence that little part about being legal tender for all debts public and private), otherwise they're merely commodities to which people ascribe some value or worst case scenario worthless sheets of paper or wasted bits on someone's hard drive. The subject of are bitcoins a commodity or currency at the moment is actually an interesting topic IMO. 
Now granted bitcoin lacks the advantage of being backed backed by a government like the aforementioned currencies. Having said backing automatically serve as a huge bonus the big reasons being you can only pay your taxes in your respective currency and the government is the single largest employer in most countries. That doesn't even begin to cover all the transfer payments governments handle from subsidies to fines to loans, etc...
The day you can say go and buy your gas or pay your cable bill with bitcoin (silly examples but still) would be a great halfway point and while I read the stories "why Iceland should use btc as their currency" with a grain of cautious curiousity, I'm not convinced it'll never happen. 
It's much like the resting definition of inertia, an object at rest stays at rest unless acted upon by a net force. Aka people will keep using their same old currencies and payment methods for countless reasons unless we (the net force) push gently in the right direction. 
TL:DR: Without more adoption and payment acceptance, bitcoin risks being relegated to commodity status (perhaps as it is now) rather than a currency.
