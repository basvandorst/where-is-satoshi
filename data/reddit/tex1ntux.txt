Thanks for that ad-hominem straw man. So rare to see the combo.
My point is that you should be building wealth and not saving money. Every major currency is deflationary by design, because HODLing money produces no value. You should want to take money and convert it to assets by investing in real estate, a business, stocks, etc.

Money shouldn’t be used to store value, assets are for storing value. Money is for transacting. If money retains its value, or increases in value, people are less likely to spend it and the economy suffers. There’s a reason why billionaires have portfolios and not giant vaults holding cash.

it's only profit if you sell

Ok bud. How about tonight you sit on your hoard and count it and I’ll take an Uber to go out to eat and have a drink with some friends. Which of our evenings will have a greater impact on the economy?
Earning and spending drives the economy. Saving means spending money to acquire assets, like bitcoin, stocks, bonds, etc. Money by itself is just an intermediary.

Get outta here with your “facts” and “logic”!
What, did you read a book or somethin?

Who is going to accept bitcoin for food or rent if it is illegal to do so? How will the network operate if a country blocks all bitcoin related traffic? If you can’t broadcast transactions or get the latest block, the system crumbles.

What makes you think governments couldn't stop bitcoin? First they could shut down agencies that allowed you to exchange fiat for bitcoin, choking the liquidity supply and making it impossible to cash out. Second, they could make it illegal for businesses to accept bitcoin as payment. Third, they could go nuclear and block internet traffic related to bitcoin.
Bitcoin is not "anti-fragile". It just hasn't pissed anyone off enough yet.

Obviously that was the Illuminati. They had a meeting at the Bohemian Grove and decided to announce Cambridge Analytica as a false flag to distract people from the real privacy abuse threat - blockchain drone cameras gathering surveillance for the Deep State.

It’s a super expensive (starting at $22.5K/year per person) data feed and trading platform. Early access to info like this is half the reason to pay for it.

Bloomberg’s motto is “Before it’s here, it’s on the Terminal”. The article probably hit Terminal and led some people to sell - that’s why people pay $20k/year for Terminal access.

They both apply. The sale transaction is when the loss is realized. You then recognize the loss/gain for tax purposes.

Realizing losses can save you a lot of money on your taxes.
@_date: 2018-06-25 23:16:26
You have an unrealized loss (aka 'paper loss') until you sell. You can hold off on selling to wait for an advantageous time to realize those losses, for instance, if you were to have a large amount of capital gains from a separate investment and wanted to offset them. A good example is Rupert Murdoch selling his $125mm stake in Theranos for $1 ([link]( He could have held onto his shares longer, maybe have seen them liquidated for a million dollars, but he wanted to realize the loss to reduce the tax bill on returns from his other investments.

Posts like this make me sad because they reflect how little people care about the fundamental values of Bitcoin and how it is essentially just a lottery ticket. There is a lot of greed in this sub, to the point it drowns our rational criticisms and concerns, but it is the people like this who put their hopes in something they don’t even understand who will ultimately be wiped out when Bitcoin crashes again.

Money should lose value. The point of money is to use it to exchange goods and services - not to hoard it. Inflation encourages spending and investing. Gold does not have the potential to grow over time like a business, and will never produce interest or dividends. It just retains its value very well.

Of course they can. Here's how:
* Make it illegal to accept or trade bitcoin (bye Bitpay, Coinbase, Localbitcoin, etc)
* Make it illegal to run or advertise a node (good luck finding/connecting to peers on the network)
* Make it illegal to mine bitcoin (and seize hardware from illegal operations)
* Use deep packet inspection to block or slow bitcoin traffic
RIP Bitcoin.
