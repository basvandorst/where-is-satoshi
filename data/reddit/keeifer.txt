I don't think Bitcoin will get rid of banks.  People still need loans and contrary to a lot of opinion here, people want banks to store their wealth.  There's a reason most people don't store all of their wealth in physical cash in their house.  It's a security concern as it's much easier to rob you and it's also not insured.
The banks would still exist and just deal in Bitcoin, instead of fiat.  So you're just adding Bitcoin's energy consumption on top of the banking system's consumption.

This is the reason why I got out of this market.  Say what you will about Bitcoin but the market for it is dangerous and I don't think it's going to end well when governments start cracking down.

I don't think fiat is the main cause of warfare.  Elected officials are signing off on the printing of those dollars.  
That's like saying guns kill people.

I guess, personally, I just don't see the point in putting in so much effort when I haven't had any problems trusting traditional payment methods and banks.

Do you just mean that once the transaction is sent there's no parties involved?  Because I still don't see how there's no parties involved if you're having to use software developed by other parties.

Bitcoin doesn't change tax policies.  That's a legislative issue.

Exactly.  So what am I misinformed about here when saying our monetary and war policies are decided by elected officials?
I don't see Bitcoin solving the issues of campaign funding and social influence.  It's pseudo-anonymous which could make it worse.  And if Bitcoin is successful, untraceable cryptocurrencies like monero will be successful as well, which I'm sure would make political corruption more proliferate.    
On the topic of super PACs, I'm reading they are required to report their funding sources every few months.  They are also a new phenomenon that have only been illegal for 8 years that could, and hopefully will be, outlawed with legislation.    
I think our political issues go much deeper than just our means of exchange.  For example, the US has averaged a 50-60% voter turn out in that last few national elections and ~40% for midterms.   I think better education of government and focusing on, and encouraging, the importance of political involvement is more important.  
We still live in a democracy.  All of the action and legislation regarding marijuana laws in the last decade proves people can enable any policies if they really care enough.  Sadly, a large portion of the population just doesn't and I don't think Bitcoin solves that.

I'll admit I'm not very informed on this topic but I don't see what I'm missing.  In the US at least, elected officials are signing off on declarations of war and military budgets.  As well as appointing individuals to govern the federal reserve and monetary policy.

Sounds like a utopian fantasy.  Bitcoin won't stop greed.  Even the creator kept 5% of the entire supply to himself and is already in the top 100 most wealthy list.

I do understand it's open source and anyone can look at the code.  But I don't know enough to verify that it's secure and I would imagine it would take years of education and experience to gain such knowledge.  Which isn't reasonable.
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:00:01
I see.  I don't see how this changes anything though.  You need to interact with a client to use Bitcoin and unless you're knowledgeable and have the time to go through the code yourself, you have to trust that client.
edit:  I understand the clients/wallets are open source but I'd imagine you need a high level of education and expertise to verify their security yourself.

I've not looked into hardware wallets yet but that seems like an even higher level of trust required.
