here is a step by step guide for using Coinbase to buy Bitcoin: 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:07:59
you're right. Coinbase USD balances have FDIC insurance because customer funds are stored in their bank accounts which are protected by FDIC. Doesn't apply to stock exchanges.

Great technology, but there is a large discrepancy of those who understand it vs those who invest in it

unfortunately this is overestimating the majority of cryptocurrency investors. notice I said most and not all.
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:56:02
yeah this is a good strategy. this video is just more of a warning towards keeping everything on an exchange
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:25:15
yup that's the best. Use GDAX like the guide says and you'll pay no fees for transferring to your wallet
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:19:00
if you're a day trader, you have no choice but to trust the exchange you use since you need the funds on demand for trading, so this advice doesn't apply to day traders. Just always be cautious regardless of which exchange you use
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:11:20
It depends what kind of wallet you want to get. I would suggest a hardware wallet, either the Trezor or Ledger. They list on their websites which currencies they support. Once you get that you'll be able to transfer all your crypto there and keep your currencies very secure

the most popular desktop wallet is Electrum, and they just discovered a critical security vulnerability in it. I would encourage you to go for a hardware wallet, you won't regret it. Trezor makes a great hardware wallet

It takes forever to get verified. You'll find people who hate every exchange. Coinbase is the easiest one to start with so I'd recommend that. Here is a step by step guide for using it : 
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:26:40
It emphasizes the point that exchanges have full control of your crypto and there is no insurance on it 
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:27:18
Not sure if those concepts are essential to understanding that exchanges control your crypto when you leave it on an exchange 
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:55:05
yup, for any currency, you have to send a transaction through the currencies network so you'll pay the fee for that. then the currency will be on the exchange and you can sell from there
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:47:31
don't you have to transfer USD into your Gemini account before trading?
@_date: 2018-01-05 02:40:25
Most people who diversify are investing for short term gains and don't understand/don't care about the technology they are investing in
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:45:44
Coinbase. Add a credit card and you can get instant crypto: 
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:09:50
they do, but they have FDIC insurance for money on the exchange and a ton more federal regulation which crypto exchanges don't have
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:17:06
you will have to pay a transaction fee, since that is a transaction that goes through the bitcoin network to transfer your coins from your wallet to Coinbase/GDAX's wallet
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:40:06
here is a guide for using coinbase, which is the best entry point for beginners: 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:13:00
its the easiest way to start for beginners. here is a guide for using coinbase and storing your coin in a hardware wallet: 
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:35:57
correct. Moving from GDAX to cold storage is free. GDAX -&gt; Coinbase and Coinbase -&gt; GDAX are always free. Converting to alt coins will incur a trading fee as a trade would have to be executed.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:45:33
Coinbase is the best entry point for beginners. Here is a step by step guide on using it and transferring via GDAX to avoid fees:  Also, it's better not to advertise how much you have invested in crypto
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:38:39
Coinbase is still the easiest platform to use, its easy to set up recurring buys. If you transfer to GDAX then transfer to your wallet from there, you will not pay any transfer fees. If you plan investing $100 month into Bitcoin, I think it's a no brainer to get a hardware wallet and call it a day. They're extremely secure and easy to use. You won't regret it. Here is a guide showing you how to do all the things I mentioned above: 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:56:18
buy whenever and never sell. You can use any service but don't think about day trading crypto unless you want to lose money
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:57:02
Limit orders are great, but in order to use them, you need have a USD/fiat balance in your account and then place your order. For a beginner, I’d rather them get their coin instantly for a fee than potentially failing to deposit money, or having their funds lost or stolen, which has happened at other exchanges. My opinion is crypto and the currency should be held in the exchange for as little time as possible.

@_date: 2017-12-24 23:18:32
you can transfer to GDAX and transfer from GDAX to any wallet you have for free. here's a guide if you need some help:  I would recommend the Trezor hardware wallet.

Here is a guide on using Coinbase and storing your Bitcoin securely: 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:14:21
hardware wallets are extremely secure, they aren't vulnerable to software viruses so you could even use them on an infected computer. If you buy Bitcoin on Coinbase, they still own your Bitcoin, so moving your Bitcoin to a hardware wallet puts you in control of your bitcoin. even if you lose your hardware wallet, most have PIN numbers you need to enter so no one can do anything with it, and you can regenerate the wallet using a 24 word seed that you write down when you initialize the wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:05:36
Idk, the user tried to make a transaction on the Bitcoin Cash network, which resulted in the issue. I don't think that points to a security flaw of the HW wallet
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:19:42
I haven't tried it but I've heard bad things about people losing money on it and its CEO has even said there are better exchanges out there. I'd say Coinbase is a good starting point and then you can try out another exchange later.
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:11:52
no fees for transferring crypto from GDAX

@_date: 2017-12-25 01:27:49
nice! you definitely won't regret it
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:19:20
You should be fine leaving it on the exchange until your Trezor ships.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:49:29
Yup, that’s the one I recommend, it’s so easy to use and fully featured
