Ah, maybe that's the confusion I struggle with... 
I did find a users list online but I don't know when it was leaked. I know I was on the 2011 list, though.

I'll try to remember that while having a 357 Magnum in my mouth.

Almost only bought. 
I did make some (failed) attempts at selling high and buying high. But the reason I think I haven't yet made a profit in the meaning of the law, is I have only withdrawn bitcoins from MtGox, not fiat.

Yes, my mail address was in the 2011 leak. 
I'm very interested to know if that data can be linked to the recent trading data leak. I haven't looked at the trading leak so I can't tell.

Ok, thanks. 
What if the traded "thing" is a GoxCoin, an off-blockchain digit in the Gox database, that I never traded into fiat? 
In the case of the collectors' couch, what if I just kept it without selling it. Isn't that the same thing as keeping the coins without trading them to fiat?

Thank you, mr door knocker.

Good point. 
However, since the data is globally accessible, the overlap may be non-ignorable.

Thanks for commenting. 
I'm not worried about the IRS, since I haven't yet sold any of my BTC and made a legal profit.  
I do worry about someone coming to my door and "persuading" me to give up my private keys.

Thanks for commenting. 
So the data from the leaked username list and the leaked trading system data cannot be linked to each other in any way?
The hackers do have access to my personal data indirectly, since my mail address is linkable to my identity.
