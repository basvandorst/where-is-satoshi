No she won’t but that’s fine. Not enough room, plus one side is totally dark. We’ll need our tans
@_date: 2019-07-25 18:00:30
Pretty smart my friend. Silicon mugs will be. Upvote for you
@_date: 2019-07-30 21:11:54
Well framed and spot on. Upvote for you my friend
@_date: 2019-07-25 13:24:20
Exactly my thought
@_date: 2019-07-30 21:17:12
Or is this just fantasy?
@_date: 2019-07-27 00:34:25
Lol. Seriously?  Upvote for you cuz I also like turtles
@_date: 2019-07-25 18:03:50
Ya. Exactly. That way I get more of a warm fuzzy feeling
@_date: 2019-07-25 16:50:32
It doesn’t unless you can prove it
@_date: 2019-07-27 04:46:09
Lol. Not even
@_date: 2019-07-18 06:30:59
Well, this is confusing as hell for a Bitcoin newbie like me. Believe on the dinosaur? Mmhh
@_date: 2019-07-27 02:26:40
Gotta hate it when that happens
@_date: 2019-07-31 01:42:05
@_date: 2019-07-27 02:26:49
Lol. Gotta hate it when that happens
@_date: 2019-07-25 17:30:26
I was thinking about the same but for my Mac. But then again I might become too obsessed over it and start breaking coffee mugs when price drops so maybe I’ll just skip it... or maybe I’ll go buy used coffee mugs at a thrift store
@_date: 2019-07-30 04:00:55
Lol! Buddy almost missed his turn
@_date: 2019-07-29 23:40:19
Ya. Just make sure you sell before the next drop or your boss is going to have a fun time with you

If you have unlimited “almost fee” electricity, then you should consider starting with a good computer, somewhere around $750. But say, you live with your parents and their electricity bill jumps by $200/mo this might be an issue.
@_date: 2019-08-16 12:55:29
I like
@_date: 2019-08-08 05:27:49
Yup, Coinbase is a good way to get started and grow and learn from there.
@_date: 2019-08-30 04:56:36
Lol. I’ll pass but thanks
@_date: 2019-08-09 23:10:34
Patience my friend, patience
@_date: 2019-08-28 00:48:58
And Upvoted
@_date: 2019-08-09 05:20:58
Oh man! ��
@_date: 2019-08-24 03:50:30
Yup. This is some scary stuff.
@_date: 2019-08-09 03:13:58
@_date: 2019-08-27 03:32:11
Dude you’re too tense. Better hang out with us by the beach
@_date: 2019-08-07 20:59:13
Good. Scumbags like these give BTC a bad vibe. We need to weed them out
@_date: 2019-08-10 04:57:46
Yeah, good point. Maybe because thy seemed eternal to us?
@_date: 2019-08-08 03:06:56
Yup. To the point
@_date: 2019-08-14 00:56:53
Cool. Thanks. Missed that one
@_date: 2019-08-14 01:49:04
I had $688,554. Darn close

@_date: 2019-08-09 20:49:04
Here’s the skinny. To profit from mining you need to invest in real rigs (specific computers). Based on current prices a single good machine runs for about $2.5K. You need to know how much you pay per kWh of electricity. If you pay more than 15 cents US most likely you won’t make much or probably none. A phone, laptop, general computer or even a gaming computer (strong video card) is no longer powerful enough to mine due to the complexity of the mathematical problems that they need to solve. 
Plenty of resources out there that can even break down revenue per rig and ROI. 
Anyhow, as long as BTC prices keep on going on there’s money to be made in mining, but not as much as before. Especially with all these mega-mining operations worldwide.
@_date: 2019-08-06 01:14:12
It might just make it on its own if it continues this way. The whales should give it another kick in the butt to push it a bit more. By Friday it should be at 12k or down below 10k. But that’s just me thinking out loud
@_date: 2019-08-29 03:09:51
So why post his crap here?  Better to just ignore him and for his followers to follow him outside of this sub.
@_date: 2019-08-31 22:36:36
Spot on and simply explained. I’m on the same boat. Making small sacrifices here and there in order to turn that fiat into Sats. I guess there are also different levels of greed... Just keep on buying ��
@_date: 2019-08-31 22:38:07
On the other hand BTC helped you when in need, so that’s a plus. I think the market still young and as long as we think long-term we’ll be fine
@_date: 2019-08-25 21:07:52
Lol. Yeah. I was at 21MM,  but made me some more after this post.
@_date: 2019-08-09 23:13:20
Lol. Actually, squid and octopus are very smart. I first thought you typed squirrel. Now, those aren’t that smart.
@_date: 2019-08-28 00:48:41
Thanks for the detailed info. We need to call out all these scams when they pop up. After following this sub for a few months now I’m amazed on how many new to BTC ppl are always arriving with basically zero knowledge about it and eager to get in the game. That’s just perfect fuel for scammers. I’ve gotten who knows how many PMs and although I ignore them or tell them to Foff after they mention about a Bitcoin opp I should’ve probably follow along and then expose them here.
@_date: 2019-08-06 06:51:49
Up we go!!!!!
@_date: 2019-08-31 05:27:35
Lol. This was different. Got me going there for a few lines
@_date: 2019-08-09 03:47:04
Super. Thanks. I’ll check it out and best of luck. Hope we’ll hit $20K by early 20
@_date: 2019-08-27 05:46:10
Man, that made me laugh then cry. I feel your pain.
@_date: 2019-08-29 03:31:03
2FA. All the way
@_date: 2019-08-06 06:54:13
Haha. It could get messy
@_date: 2019-08-06 10:07:50
Packed up my depends just in case
@_date: 2019-08-21 22:42:02
We’re all Satoshis
@_date: 2019-08-26 02:04:29
Lol. For real
@_date: 2019-08-08 05:10:47
That also caught my attention. There’s gotta be more to the tale making BTC even more attractive to OP.
@_date: 2019-08-03 21:56:42
Most common is people masked as businesses asking you to send them your BTC so that they can give you a better return. That in all shapes and forms. Since greed is so powerful and there are so many people new to BTC many often fall for these scams. Stick around this sub-reddit and you’ll see them often. These posts are taken down all the time.
@_date: 2019-08-08 21:42:41
Damn scammers... Also make sure to cover your webcam with electrical tape when in need
@_date: 2019-08-28 02:09:30
Ya. What an infestation of so called “experts”. I guess we’ll be seeing many more as BTC gains popularity.
@_date: 2019-08-29 03:44:11
Yup. Good ole theft.
@_date: 2019-08-06 06:48:14
Ya. Pretty nutty last 24. I guess it’s a mixed of both.
@_date: 2019-08-10 02:44:56
You should look at it as a long term investment instead
@_date: 2019-08-10 02:46:31
Always try to buy more. Higher purchases to lower the cost of  transaction fees
@_date: 2019-08-14 00:58:13
Yup. It will be interesting to see where we’re at by the weekend. and same here sitting on mine for a long long time
@_date: 2019-08-08 05:22:31
It needs to evolve fast to a common and popular payment/transaction gateway. People need to hoard a bit less and spend a bit more out there to fuel the BTC-ecosystem. I’m spending a bit more when possible regardless of the recent spikes and drops... in for a Satoshi, in for a BTC...
@_date: 2019-08-31 12:08:54
Lol. No thank you
@_date: 2019-08-07 01:16:45
But as long as it doesn’t enter Uranus.
@_date: 2019-08-08 03:08:00
Shhhh is right!
@_date: 2019-08-07 01:15:32
Pm me as well. I just got some free DAI from them.
@_date: 2019-08-06 05:22:39
That was a good read. Thanks
@_date: 2019-08-31 21:41:31
Lol. Yeah. Plenty of those so-called experts floating around. I probably block 3 to 5 every day but they keep on popping up
@_date: 2019-08-28 02:26:36
Ya. And you’re such an enlightenment too.
@_date: 2019-08-31 22:08:04
That’s interesting and different.  ���� wins
@_date: 2019-08-25 23:19:43
It depends. Where would you be going?
@_date: 2019-08-26 02:07:31
I conquered
@_date: 2019-08-26 02:02:30
Buddy finally shows up. About time!
@_date: 2019-08-03 21:51:29
Congrats and best of luck. Getting started is the difficult part. But you’re past that. Now just watch out for scammers as they’re everywhere
@_date: 2019-08-09 02:37:47
And say it proud!
@_date: 2019-08-29 03:01:15
Ya. I can imagine. This being a small dip compared to back then. Still, in for the long haul here.
@_date: 2019-08-08 05:05:33
Lol. Ack indeed
@_date: 2019-08-21 04:51:27
Man that’s some good shit you’re on. Bravo! ��
@_date: 2019-08-10 02:41:51
Yup. FOMO can be a real MOFO
@_date: 2019-08-08 01:15:53
Nope. All good here.
@_date: 2019-08-25 20:57:42
Yes it is. The most expensive part is the electricity. Knocking this cost down should be giving you a profit.  Not that hard to figure out especially since you already cleared the air that you’re the boss so can’t get caught and since your server room is temp controlled. So yeah, go for it.
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:10:53
Lol. Upvote for ya!
@_date: 2019-08-19 21:32:07
Haha! There you go!
@_date: 2019-08-08 23:47:07
Nice. What do expect you can get out of with current rates? I’m about to get me a couple and plan solar long term
@_date: 2019-08-06 05:46:44
Haha. Seriously
@_date: 2019-08-28 00:27:22
Check back tomorrow
@_date: 2019-08-28 02:54:22
WTF are you on about? Like really and such
@_date: 2019-08-31 22:42:08
Now this is excellent and just the right way to disseminate knowledge about it. Well done and have fun while educating the intellectual ones... Much much better than all of those hideous YouTube videos and crappy sites popping here all the time.
@_date: 2019-08-19 21:34:13
Yup. He better call Saul
@_date: 2019-08-12 03:41:04
They’re super safe. You can rest assured. Smoke a joint if need be. Sweet BTC dreams
@_date: 2019-08-27 04:12:06
You’re not alone bud
@_date: 2019-08-23 05:52:54
We’re all Satoshi
@_date: 2019-08-09 23:16:49
It is very scary for sure. And I think we’ll see more scams as BTC attracts new people hooked on greed
@_date: 2019-08-13 01:49:39
It better be or we’ll kick his ass
@_date: 2019-08-25 20:45:23
Haha. True.
@_date: 2019-08-05 05:49:22
so yet another one
@_date: 2019-08-08 23:50:54
Lol. Indeed. I guess we’ve seen plenty of those around
@_date: 2019-10-01 04:08:41
@_date: 2019-08-09 02:40:21
It has ponzy and pyramid written all over. Most likely your friend will end up screwed. Walk away
@_date: 2019-12-07 01:39:42
Hook, line and sinker. Well played
@_date: 2019-12-05 08:39:52
Before when?
@_date: 2019-09-04 04:23:41
Yup. You read my thoughts. Back then was hit or miss. Today it’s pretty spot on due to technology. BTC experts are more 50/50 at best.
@_date: 2019-09-04 04:37:37
Indeed. Then we also have all these bloggers and third class websites spamming with their so-called expertise when they mainly repost what’s out there. Just for the ad revenue, which already sucks as it is. 
 I’m all for fomenting BTC and help make it more popular by educating people on how it works with factual info and I wonder how damaging all these hideous, misleading and childish videos and sites are.
@_date: 2019-09-12 07:28:23
You’re not
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:32:09
Wheeeee! Indeed. Buckle up y’all!
@_date: 2019-09-13 00:48:50
I used to be like that. Now I check the price once a month. I’m in for the long haul anyhow, so as long as BTC doesn’t crash and burn overnight I’m not stressing myself no more
@_date: 2019-09-14 00:10:40
For real. It’s not even Forbes, they have so many “guest” writers that turned  that magazine into a joke
@_date: 2019-09-13 00:39:23
Yup. I made a bundle then. What’s your next recommendation?
@_date: 2019-09-27 23:10:10
That’s sad
@_date: 2019-09-27 23:10:18
That’s even sadder
@_date: 2019-09-01 01:00:08
Don’t believe the hype. Bitcoin will take a while before it becomes established. Nobody is going to the moon just yet
@_date: 2019-09-14 04:12:10
