Thank you for that and the article. Explains it perfectly and now I understand how ridiculous the lack of replay protection is!

"We don't want the type of people DOGE would attract." That's where I hopped in on the conversation. So ye I started when you began insulting people

Thanks for the boost of confidence. I've looked into it. Unfortunately I have a HTC one and it seems like it's pretty difficult to mount the sd card to a computer (especially on a Mac) well off to r/android I go!!

yep that's exactly the reply I was expecting cheers for staying obvious

Oh you mean bitcoin is only kept for the intelligent people and shouldn't be used by everyone? Sorry I didn't realise that I'll keep away so.

I sincerely hope it is a fad

Great thank you for the reply. However it seems that my SD card with the backup file was also wiped.. Therefore I'm only left with wallet address which I'm fairly certain there's nothing I can do now am I right? Well I guess it's a lesson anyway!

How about you stop being an asshole and knocking people down due to the fact they're actively enjoying participating in cryptocurrencies  one of the reasons they use doge coin is because there are so many asshole like you out on @_date: 2013-12-09 09:29:50
