I think in some cases you are correct. But in many other cases you are wrong. 
I truly believe in decentralized technology and I think it's going to be a huge part of the future. I was depressed for a long time untill I came over the crypto space and the dreams they represent. Dreams that are for the people. Not dreams disguised to be for the people whilst really being for a couple lucky, some hard working and some innovative few. 
But, Your showerthoughts are as shower thoughts often are, completely on point��

Up to us to spread and create the message that crypto deserves! Its soon something everyone knows of. And the more people invest the more people as a whole learn and understand.
But we have to be patient and work, learn and help grow the community - help create real life value for the cryptocurrencies. 
Ethos I feel, has the potential to be the gamechanger in many ways to help with this push/leap.
The more Crypto innovates. The more people understand that it's just like the internet but a new internet with it.
That not only grows digitally. But also physically changes the environment around them in a positive way.

Only reason Bill Harris CEO of PayPal says BTC is a scam is because UTRUST \(amongst others probably\) will replace old tech like PayPal..

That's what I've heard. Maybe not as active users, but as a grand total of investors maybe? But maybe I'm way off that's what I thought McAfee said. Mightve interpreted it wrong..

Uranus told me to invest in Bitcoin bruh
@_date: 2018-05-06 11:18:40
Yea not really since it did effect the price.
But it isnt a fair comparison to a true market crash in any sense ya

 Ive always thought of it in the way that.. Not one voice is stronger than the other \- no matter holding size. In determining the future of Bitcoin for people. It's not a currency controlling other assets/currencies to do something a certain way like Gold in a bank which turned into a blackmagicmoneymachine.
Bitcoin is fueling a free market in a true capitalist sense. But allowing for that Capital ecosystem to act as everyones right to live in a world where your currency wants mankind to prosper and heal with this planet. It wants to help the guy labouring off at the bottom. Not profit off of him as a primary goal. But instead valuing what he, as a building\-block in a business represents. And rather, help him into his true form and potential to make it extra profitable.. A market that wants that. Well no such market has ever existed. A market that on many fronts promotes unity and a sense of community Rather than just making money off of Bitcoin. Or making a parallel of todays capitalist system \- Maximizing profits at any costs for as long as you can until BOOM market crash \- and then profit off of the bloodbath you created. Sucking in the blood of the people taking care of their families \- Providing and feeding into the very system that is killing him. Or to put it lightly. Living in a instant gratification, ineffective, financially and environmentally non\-sustainable system that is collapsing as we know it. Because Hulk need substance to guide life not shallowness. grumph.
So if there is a poor distribution of the wealth in Bitcoin \- which there is. The answer in my mind is \- Only holding Bitcoin will not make you the richest anyway. But this/these individuals, only holding a huge amount of Digital Gold Money certainly have a large responsibility in creating a good future and not a bad one. One that I myself have investment opportunities for in the future. And id say they are smart because Bitcoin is probably the safest asset to invest in today. But that's jsut me. Bitcoin is the grandaddy that everyone wants there and loves tbh. And I don't even have one yet. But I will soon enough.
But in the grand scheme of things in any sense. Who is to say that Digital Gold \- is like physical gold?In the end. Digital Gold is just one BigPapaApp amongst a vast, dare I say, creatively infinite amount of resources in the universe for this market to capitalize and sustainabalize on. Legalize it.
However.. Without a sustainable revolution we are not going to Mars though. I can tell you that much.
BITCOIN MOON. ETHOS PLUTO. WOOH.

Utilize an existing token it is! Thanks for the input������
@_date: 2018-05-03 10:45:16
Well there are Dapps being created as solutions for lending.
Infrastructure would be tokens (much like apps in an appstore as Brock Pierce so eloquently puts it) and entrepreneurs that innovate via  Blockchain Technology.
EOS i.e. Is creating a really cool bit called a Leasing Ability which would allow tokenholders to literally lease/invest their own tokens to invest in businesses of which they believe in.
Everything is evolving and much is yet to be done. But it's on it's way and I aint going/rooting for the banks ever again which makes me very happy.
@_date: 2018-05-03 01:06:37
Imagine Gold that can travel as quickly as an email and is valued by you/us instead of a bank/government and then in turn us. And then imagine that this is a new sort of bank that nobody except we as a community own. Rather than a central authority that can wage wars and fund both sides of it in silence whilst millions are affected negatively. A currency that works for you and not against you in short.
@_date: 2018-05-11 03:00:23
Downvote. Cuz I want one☹️ 
@_date: 2018-05-07 11:52:36
Because they do not want to see it succeed. They don't want a viable alternative to the monetary system to exist?
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:40:54
Well you asked how it would be possible to lend/borrow if there are no banks or middlemen and people answered! :\) But personally, through Crypto, I hope and believe I wont ever have to take a loan that puts me in the shackles of illusion. Plus if anything is to be true the concept of crowdfunding and then ICO's has shown to be extremely effective whereby the future loans for businesses etc won't be necessary as long as you can build and propose a strong business proposal and proof of value. As long as there is a good platform and infrastructure for investing and all projects get a voice in the decentralized network so to speak. Maybe, in the future, the platforms for finding investors for your ideas won't depend on having contacts and in turn investors but rather desirability, sustainability and functionality rules. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 17:32:34
Oohh me too, I'm more left wing but with a passion for capitalism and it's potential. I dream of them both making a baby through a third party like crypto to take us into Space. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 11:12:16
I feel itd go up. There are other currencies that would survive. Ao I believe Bitcoin would then turn into a very safe place to store your money outside the monetary system. But as mentioned above - increased volatility.
@_date: 2018-05-06 10:24:22
I don't know if I agree.
With Greece as a small example - BTC rose exponentially during it's crash.
BTC has become a sort of safe haven from the normal/soon to be outdated system and it's crashes.
@_date: 2018-05-12 08:40:57
50 million people don't just all of a sudden stop using crypto. Grow a sack and get that stomach right. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 14:17:33
I still believe however that the price of Bitcoin would surge given a crash. But it's always speculative ofcourse

For a guy like me, that doesn’t like Coinbase. What alternative is there to buying BTC or Alts - without an intermediary such as C-base?

Not that I'm not pro medicinal and general legalization.
Don't tell people they're free - whilst forbidding nature!����
@_date: 2019-01-07 00:37:52
Next bullrun will prolly have Dapps that might just solve most of those issues. However - The barriers of entry is also that there is not enough incentive for people to join in the first place.
It’s no harder than registering a card at coinbase, (even though I don’t like Coinbase all that much) and that isn’t very hard.
@_date: 2019-01-07 00:51:35
It’s obviously not harder than that - it’s just people are to lazy to take a pic of their ID etc and get their account up and running. 
I do agree with you though. I wonder how one can simplify the barriers of entry. I’m just not sure how much easier one can make it - there are prob rules and regulations around it.

What should make you suspicious is why it isn’t catching on faster.
I would say, hyperbolic statements like these are ceertainly part of evolutions of tech and money.
The hype of going from CD to mp3 was ridiculous  and hyperbolic lol. Apple i.e. IS hyperbolic, it’s it’s friggin premise.
This is the first time in history where a currency and store of value is people powered. It’s fkn mind boggling and beautiful and takes time getting used to. 
The posts you are looking for are out there as well. Reddit/internet is about skimming through the bullshit and hype :p

Mh, that’s so friggin true. Thanks for pointing it out. I should’ve said. The first people powered currency in our digital era. But maybe this is incorrect as well!?
@_date: 2018-02-28 09:16:38
That's not true though. Every transaction, when it comes to Bitcoin, is transparent. It's easier to find crooks through Bitcoin, than it is through banks.
