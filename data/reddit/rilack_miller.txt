Since my Uni internet is crap, I can't quite watch it yet, but how would one do a "sweep"? Do you show a QR or key for sending the coins during the video? Or if someone throws a casual glance at my wallets home page they can sweep it. (Pretty sure this is not true, but better save than sorry)

Black and yellow, I hope it would work. Get that Deus Ex vibe.

Brigading is fun. People disagree so theu downvote. So it snowballs. 
While I disagree with you and want it to be widespread, but I am more than curious about your opinion.
If what you say about popular downvotings (and I do see a lot of rude and pessimistic and simply jackassish comments) that further reduces the chamce that a potential new user will join.

Ah that would make sense actually. I am under the imoression that deepweb stuff lives on btc. Can I still get amazon giftcards for btc? Are the online retailers in the sticky reliable. Guess I can do some research myself, just really tight on mobile data. 
I still love the idea of a cryptocurrency as day to day currency. 
How is linux? :D

Oh that was unexpected but welcome. And on point.

I do not believe it to be a faliure. But giving the power back to us would require it to have widespread use and acceptance, no?
For it to put a dent in government controlled currency it should become at least somewhat "mainstream" no? 
For it to be a "better alternative" more people need to use it, no?

Yes but then it would lull again? The few places that started accepting bitcoin in Budapest like 220Volt seem to have stopped. Damn shame. But maybe I can still get a cab for bitcoin...

Ah. Urbandictionary it is. Thanks.

Expecting it to click is not enough in my opinion. There is enough reason to stifle bitcoin, but pretty sure that without some coherent plan it will never go mainstream. 
I'll need to look into the debit card thing, that sounds like half a solution already!

Right, so the main screen is the public one. And the private is kept save.

Maybe I am unclear on the objective of bitcoin. What does it hope to accomplish?
@_date: 2016-09-11 04:20:51
But is that simpler than going through banks in the first place?
Bitcoin needs to see more use.
@_date: 2016-09-21 07:15:49
Then what is it? This is the one thing I can't figure out.
If it's no good for retail, what incentive is there to use it for anything else.
@_date: 2016-09-16 19:27:52
Which people? And how?
I still believe in grand plans to embetter humanity. This could be such a thing.
