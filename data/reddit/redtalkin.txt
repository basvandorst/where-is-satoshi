For users that may have this issue in the future, I have my BTC back. They replied about 24 hours after I submitted my support request. This is kind of a nice feature, so I am pleased with how it turned out. Here is their answer copied from the reply:
  
*Thank you for contacting Coinbase Support. I'd be happy to explain what has happened here.*  
 
*If an error occurs during a send,* ***funds end up in your Coinbase account*** *as a failsafe* ***to ensure funds aren't lost****. The amount for this attempted send was received into your Coinbase.com balance.*  
 
***To transfer these funds from Coinbase back to your Pro account:*** 
* *Visit the trading view at* [*pro.coinbase.com*]( 
* *Under* ***Wallet Balance****,      select* ***Deposit****.*
* *Under* ***Currency Type****,      select the digital asset you wish to transfer back into Pro.*
* *Select the* ***Coinbase Wallet*** *tab,      and then complete the transfer.* 
Following the above instructions, I had my funds back in my PRO account nearly instantaneously. Now, if they would just increase my deposit limit (I know that takes time).

Hmmm, got anything more on this? I had a problem with a transfer at CBP that didn't work (trying to send it to my Ledger, an error message said it failed and I need to do it manually). I found my funds in standard CB. I can explain more if you can explain your issue further.
