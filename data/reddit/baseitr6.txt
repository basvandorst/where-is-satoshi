Where’s the guy who said the last push was going to 10k?
I want to laugh at him.

“Those in the know”
It’s complete speculation.

...Um. No.
That’s not how this works.

I always love reading comments from pseudo investors who probably move less than $1k and act like they’re financial gurus.

Where in the flying fuck do you get that number?

This needs to be spread everywhere. 
I love reading people’s comments on their speculative bullshit on all things crypto. 
In reality, they have no idea what they’re talking about. Yes, some people got lucky, bought super cheap and sold at that ridiculous high point. Good for them, and tbh I’m jealous. But don’t act like you figured out a mega secret.
Chinese regulation (of which most people have no true knowledge of) can wreck people’s dreams in a secret. Or any random geopolitical input for that matter.

You literally just said this was your first BTC purchase. You are a noob.
“Everyone here saying I’m a noob to the NBA when I’ve been watching it for 15 years.”
“Everyone here saying I’m a noob to the stock market when I’ve been reading the Wall Street journal for 2 months.’
“Everyone here saying I’m a noob to women when I’ve been beatin it to PH for 22 years.”

They need another booth for so called bitcoin experts. ‘Reality of BTC utility and why the average person doesn’t care’
