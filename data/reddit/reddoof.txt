If you want to consume goods or services, you will pay tariffs and excise taxes. If you want to live completely off the grid with no external reliance, then sure, you can feasibly avoid a lot of this--but there's not really such a thing as a freeholder anymore, so you'll still be taxed on your property. 
If you think cryptocurrency is a way to reduce or escape your future tax burden, I think you ought to be prepared for great disappointment.

It should go without saying, but all too often it's somehow not obvious enough. Never put all your eggs in one basket.

ELI5: What is the "meaning" of currency?
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:27:57
Came here in the past week after being idle in the world of Bitcoin for the past couple years. I wish this had been the first post I'd seen, because a lot of the nonsense would have made a lot more sense right off the bat.

He's not saying it's dependent on paper money, he's saying its buying power fluctuates because we're in an economy that is built around USD. He's arguing semantics of the word *currency*, because BTC isn't the basis for the economy we live in.
It *is* a good point, but it has nothing to do with the outlook on BTC's value.

Governments have always found a way to tax the people. The type of currency has never been a hindrance.

I've had funds in and out of Coinbase for over three years with literally zero problems. How exactly have they defrauded me?

If they're slow to respond, that would be all the more reason to reach out to them sooner rather than later. Maybe the transaction will be confirmed by the time they respond. :)
While you're waiting, here's a good bit of info:

What is this "value expression system" you speak of? Did I miss that day in economics class where they talked about value expression systems?

From just skimming this sub, I get the feeling that there are quite a large number of people out there who don't have much in the way of disposable income yet have put whatever they have in to BTC. Those are the people, I expect, who are quicker to spend the BTC they have.

I'd prefer to help promote Bitcoin with legitimate and ethical business. I earn a living ethically, by helping other people be more efficient and productive. I sleep peacefully every night knowing I have no need to try and cheat people out of their time or money.

The idea that the past so simply predicts the future has been played out for centuries. Previous spins on a roulette wheel don't influence the odds of the next spin. Neither does trading history of an asset directly influence the next trade.

So if you get 100 satoshi every 5 minutes, and keep going for a solid hour you'll have 1200 satoshi (worth about 6.8 cents). Go at it for a solid 8 hour day and you'll bank a little over 50 cents' worth of BTC.
...why not do productive work instead? Work minimum wage for one hour and buy BTC with it... you'll have 1,260,564 satoshi more than you will rotting your brain in front of a lame faucet.

Why are they being compared in USD? How about show BTC to BTC.

Yeah I remember the typo origin. If you leave out "especially a cryptocurrency", then you just described long term holding of any asset. Maybe it will stick. I just hope it starts looking more...mature.

I'm just an average Joe, so all I can go by is what my financial advisers say. They all just use one word: "hold". Stocks, bonds, funds, and real estate... the word is "hold". Maybe there's another word, but that one has worked well for me for the past 15 years--and for many other people for much, much longer. 
Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with people choosing something silly for the sake of silliness. At the same time, I'm looking forward to more people like me--average Joes with most of our investments elsewhere--to take Bitcoin more seriously for long term investment. 
Outsiders say Bitcoin is a fraud... a pretend currency... And when the Bitcoin community uses fake and pretend words to express excitement about it, those outsiders are going to keep saying, "look at those cute kids who think they're on to something." I'd rather have them invested--it would be good for all of us.
OK, time to step off my pretend soapbox... :)

First two words: "Bitcoin tanked" ...and CNBC wonders why they don't have an audience.

It was meant as a rhetorical question. While you're right about the economic cost, the transaction fees aren't paid in USD--they're paid in BTC. It wouldn't make sense to devalue transactions based on a currency that isn't the currency being exchanged.

Why did you leave out mention of the finance department, human resources department, and most importantly the department department?
I mean, the way this is written, they're clearly all the same one person. But still...

There are other economic lessons here, also. Like never buy food or drink at CVS unless the convenience is worth overpaying. My neighborhood grocery store has 1.25 liter sodas for $1 right now.
Also, product placement. When the grocery store had 20 oz sodas by the register for $.99, all you had to do was walk to the soda aisle to get a 2-liter of the same product for $.69. (Sorry, I'm using old prices, I have been ~~poison-free~~ soda-free since Dec 2009!)

Came to mine when it was a hair over $100. Fell into the Butterfly Labs crap and sold off most of my btc at a hair over $200. Came back around $3K to HOLD for the long term. (I can't bring myself to misspell that on purpose and pretend holding is a new thing.)

If you earn $1 today and $1 tomorrow, does it matter which one you spend first? No. They both have serial numbers on them, but that has no bearing on the value of the bill. Same goes for Bitcoin. Which wallet you spend from has no bearing on how you report your cost basis.
