4. They don’t do their own research
5. They don’t do their own research
You get the point
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:41:19
While I agree with most of what you said the rest of the world depends on us regardless of what the brainwashed citizens think. My point is the US thinks the world revolves around them because it does. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 10:11:21
If your gonna be dumb, you gotta be tough.
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:41:40
Asking people to change is not expressing a view. Bub
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:04:12
Its ugly right now but I just can’t see this being the end of crypto. considering almost all of this fud is based on mostly spun media and lies means that once the gmen regulate it the media will then embrace it and up up and away. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:10:29
So they can get in cheap.
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:20:37
Guess i should have read the article. Hahaha. So tired of fud articles at this point.

@_date: 2018-02-11 01:43:56
Absolutely! You should retain an attorney and lead the charge for the rest of us!!! I hope you don’t run out of money first though.
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:59:36
That makes it even better.
Lol “This doesn’t include me and i didn’t even make it myself. Enjoy!” What a sideways market we live in. Been what 2 days sideways?
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:31:06
Another TravonJames wanna be. I hope nobody takes any advice from this clown.

If you buy usd with coinbase there is no fee then transfer it to gdax again, free then buy bitcoin and only pay the exchange fee. This has seriously lowered my fees.
@_date: 2017-05-16 14:30:54
Lol amid Trump.

My advice would be to up his purchase to about 10,000usd.
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:38:20
Scam alert!
@_date: 2017-06-02 21:35:52
Sucks when you show up late to the party. Patience is your friend while getting into crypto at this juncture.
Edit: i load Usd on coinbase and then transfer to gdax to buy btc/eth/ltc so this circumnavigates most of the fees
