And to thank you for the lengthy answer, have a beer on me. @_date: 2014-05-13 17:18:04
You can help me. Shouldn't it really be 'La Maison de Bitcoin' and not 'La Maison du Bitcoin'. I'm not a native French speaker, but the grammar sounds unusual to me. Can you please confirm whether my suspicions are correct?

Thanks for the really comprehensive reply. Makes sense on all levels.

Why can I buy gold online using my debit card (like [here]( but not bitcoin? Don't gold vendors face the same chargeback problems?

From the FAQ:




This seems a bit silly to me. If they are trying to promote the usage and acceptance of bitcoin, putting a fake signature certificate with their product seems backward, no?

Good luck to them, I'll be sure to check it out. Does anyone know which exchange they are pegging their pricing to?

Maybe my question was poorly phrased. To rephrase: Why can't I buy bitcoin with my debit card?
I'd asked this somewhere else, and was told it was because of chargeback on the debit card payment: an unscrupulous buyer could buy bitcoin, then ask for chargeback on his card, and walk away with free bitcoin. But the gold vendors appear to have solved this somehow, and I was wondering if their solution could work for bitcoin instead of gold.

Please would you consider also releasing on windows phone? Almost all their handsets have nfc compatibility, but I'm still awaiting the breakthrough app which would mean users actually use it. This would be it.

I'd be curious to know what BTC-GBP conversion rate you use for the VAT return. Given the volatility of BTC it could make a huge difference to the tax payable. I'm pretty certain HMRC wouldn't have the means to dispute whichever rate you use...
