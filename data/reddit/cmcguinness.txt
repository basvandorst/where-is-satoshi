He was a funny guy, and like all funny guys his humor has enough truth in it to make you laugh. That's all it's worth.

Sure, happens all the time!  Although it usually involves lengthy civil war, the death of the Tsar and his family, and the quick realization that "the people" really aren't any better off. But 50 years later the movie about it will win a ton of Academy Awards.
