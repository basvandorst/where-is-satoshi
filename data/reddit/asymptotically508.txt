Samourai Wallet supports SegWit, but not native/bech32 addresses.
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:25:36


Great stuff, we can all go home now.
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:24:04
Sending to a Bech32 address makes a smaller transaction, and is just generally nicer (error checking, no visually similar characters).
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:35:55
Layer 2 solutions keep transactions out of the blockchain. Have a read through [lightning.network]( :)

I just tried it myself and I couldn't get the Ledger to work at all on Android :(
Sorry I thought it would be the same as desktop.

@_date: 2018-01-30 10:01:12
~~Electrum supports both.~~
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:41:52
It just has a JSONRPC API on top of HTTP so you can just use plain old XMLHttpRequests.
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:19:33
What do you think the OP links to? (Hint: we're looking at a transaction on this open ledger where somebody has moved $400M worth of coin)
Compare this with something like Monero where [(somebody) has sent (some amount) to (somebody)]( and it's nearly impossible to find out those values.
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:31:16
Bitcoin Cash has replay protection so you can just sweep your coins into a new Bitcoin address, then do the same to a new Bitcoin Cash address.
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:59:28
bech32 has error correction and is easier to read than the old base 58 addresses. Also I think that they result in slightly smaller transactions than if you used P2SH-P2WSH addresses.
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:34:12


It's quite the opposite. Bitcoin has an open and transparent blockchain that anybody can view. Companies like ChainAnalysis are getting pretty good at tracking your coins even when they go through a mixer.
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:39:32
Electrum works with segwit addresses and the Ledger.
When you press create a new wallet from hardware device, use the derivation path `m/49'/0'/0'` and it automagically figures it out.
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:22:56
When creating a new wallet, Electrum asks which kind you want.
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:49:41
Electrum with a Ledger Nano S.
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:43:29
Addresses that start with a 3 are P2SH addresses. They might be multisig addresses, some kind of smart contract or a wrapper for a segwit address.

Because it's [an easy, open protocol]( I don't think there's any reason to hate Electrum for having a JSONRPC API, but it definitely needs authentication.

Electrum isn't always used from the same host though. The API can be used by merchants/faucets/whoever in their sites.
Don't forget that [Bitcoin Core itself has a JSONRPC API]( as does [Monero]( and pretty much everything else.
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:48:08
It depends on the CORS headers on the remote host.
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:09:35


Wow, much private.
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:38:13
I think they'd still be able to read your transaction history.
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:44:45
I'm using a Ledger Nano S and Electrum, and to set it up I just changed the BIP32 derivation path to m/84'/0'/0'
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:43:48

It depends. You'd never see anything if you tried to mine Bitcoin with a graphics card today, but some other coins have different proof of work algorithms that don't lend themselves to ASICs.

I suppose that there are [more things to worry about]( but you need to draw the line somewhere.


You're right, everything is hackable. You just need to think about your threat model and design a system that meets your needs.

I think we're misunderstanding each other. [Devs could write some code to censor valid transactions]( but ultimately it's up to the miners to choose which transactions they want to put into a block.

@_date: 2017-06-16 13:10:38
afaik miners in a pool don't really work together.
when you mine in a pool, you still try to find blocks on your own. it's just that you show the pool the work you've done to find a block and you get remunerated for it even if you don't find a block.
the time between you finding a block mining on a pool and solo mining is the same.
