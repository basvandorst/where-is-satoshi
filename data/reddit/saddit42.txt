there are some people I can always count on to have reasonable opininions on things that matter... erik voorhees is one of them.
@_date: 2015-12-08 17:01:16
wow.. i guess 80% of that went to tiffany.. nice :D
@_date: 2015-06-02 18:39:22
i know.. but i'm concerned about the focus.
i like payment channels for cases like streamium.io but i would like the normal single payment case to stay a conventional one payment one blockchain entry thing. so without the need to have an online connection to someone specific but just to the network
@_date: 2015-06-03 08:34:10
yea.. and the nsa
@_date: 2015-06-18 12:13:22

@_date: 2015-06-24 12:59:20
actually quite interesting right now
@_date: 2015-06-24 01:04:59
Ok, now think what changetip is doing.. enabling bitcoin transfers WITHOUT using the blockchain.. and its centralized..
so they don't like gavins proposal.. that makes me like gavins proposal even more.. 
does noone notice how all the guys that profit from a not scalable core function of bitcoin are against gavins proposal?? like blockstream and now changetip??
Still I'm pretty disappointed by changetip
@_date: 2015-06-02 09:13:36
if you dont move it you will not lose it, even if bitcoin splits
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:37:49
you make a lot of tips.. make sure your account gets not hacked :D
@_date: 2015-06-02 18:49:13
as long it is not on the blockchain it is coupled to SOME IP..
either to some providers ip that hosts your "lighning-account" (centralization) or your own server that has a smtp like receiving functionality
PS: ok something bitmessage seems like a good way to avoid that
stays the need to a cupling to a pseudonym which seems to be more efford to change than a bitcoin adress (also pseudonym but easy to create)
@_date: 2015-06-03 18:14:20
tell them that hiding these 12 words is more crucial than hiding money because someone finding money at their houses would have to take it. someone finding these 12 words would only have to take a picture/write them down/remember (smaller psycological barrier).
Best would be a closed envelope
@_date: 2015-06-01 13:34:16
no it wouldn't
@_date: 2015-06-29 10:23:17
you can try to get paid in bitcoin somehow.. but as long as 99% of the population uses fiat currency you need to somehow exchange your fiat to bitcoin
@_date: 2015-06-02 00:14:36
i see.. now we have the reason why camp maxwell is against increasing.. because max has shitty internet and couldn't run a full node.. so i would say fuck our plans of bringing bitcoin to the world.. to everyone.. max has shitty internet (podcast 35:00)
@_date: 2015-06-24 21:20:42
yea of course.. at some point in time when everything crashes
@_date: 2015-06-23 18:51:43
probably he bought in for $1000 and sold for $400 and now hates it or something like that.. keep your head up..
next time
@_date: 2015-06-16 21:47:18
well.. actually i wasn't aware of this and i'm thankful that i am now
@_date: 2015-06-02 18:57:29
yea but still someone owns the server and can do with it what he wants.. so probably one guy will own a server with thousands of users (centralization)
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:19:03
with gavins proposal miners can still cap the size max size if they want but none of them is forced to.. thats democarcy..!
@_date: 2015-06-02 15:10:18
lol.. but you LOG IN.. so what should that be good for? they know who you are anyway..
they just want to make people feel they're concerned about your privacy while they give every single peace of information the nsa wants to them
@_date: 2015-06-12 20:43:48
fuck.. i wanted to implement this.. :D
@_date: 2015-06-13 20:39:26
@_date: 2015-06-15 17:48:27
i think many problems are solvable with this &gt;one chain&lt;..
e.g. verification times.. there are techniques to give high confirmation probabilities without a single confirmation.. 
mycellium is doing that with local trader.. when you have not heared of any double spend in the network the probablity is high that it didnt happen or was too slow.. of course a big miner could cheat but he also can cheat 1 confirmation.. 
so i guess the pure bitcoin, as we have it now, is very scalable.. payment channels, confirmation heuristics.. all stuff we have working NOW.. a block size increase is the only true scale as it doesnt add more complexity but lets us work with what we have
@_date: 2015-06-23 13:28:46
@_date: 2015-06-13 15:15:54
i think this whole investigation is a bit ridiculous for the following reasons:
1. I think its totally comprehensible that most of the people want an increase as most of the people want their coins to gain value which needs a bigger user base. so why shouldnt the perception that an increase is favoured just be true?
2. even when there were fake votes, why should it only be on one side of the debate? are you saying that e.g. the pro 1mb group are more honest people? So if both groups are doing it and have about the same amount of honesty it would even out. (doesn't mean that i support this kind of manipulation)
3. you were just choosing &gt;some&lt; metrics which will be interpreted now.. whether these metrics are appropriated.. who knows? e.g i seem to stand pretty far on top on your metrics what ever that means.. i didnt manipulate anything but am just very clearly and openly pro 20mb increase.
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:30:54


that's excactly what could destroy the whole field of cryptocurrencies.. 
when there's always a new cryptocurrency hat will lead the marked..! think of billions of people that can't even trust in bitcoin right now because they don't understand it.. if there comes a new cryptocurrency along every some years this will screw it up for all of us!! why should anyone trust in them in general?
a one way peg IS a new currency as probably the possiblity to one way peg isnt forever but just for a start phase.. 
you're sidechains won't protect a currency from ever being in need to ever do a hard fork again or other cryptos having nicer properties which cant be realized on a side chain.. 
you're so used to be the smart guy that you just don't realize when you're WRONG..! maybe its also blockstream what motivates you here
@_date: 2015-06-03 14:11:39
probably he went to blockchain.info to look up where his bitcoins were transferred to. then he has the bitcoin address of the hacker.. googling bitcoin addresses can sometimes lead somewhere
@_date: 2015-06-24 19:28:22
You nailled it.. see Gregory Maxwells comment on planning to release an altcoin just some hours ago:
@_date: 2015-06-18 09:04:25

very unprofessional post here: i dont like this garzik.. dont know why :P
@_date: 2015-06-16 16:16:07
the thing is in many countries (like germany) the download is not considered the illegal act but the upload. that means that at least users paying to download torrents with this wouldn't need to be behind tor.. 
i think once there are enough users willing to pay some cents for download bandwidth there will be offered torrents from countries that don't have problems with the upload of it
@_date: 2015-06-12 22:01:41
actually coming from that side i just came to that conclusion!
the best implementation will make it and that side (still in beta to be fair) seems highly improvable.. the design is ok though
@_date: 2015-06-12 19:41:53
is really noone seing it that it might be good to have hard forks every 18 month?
bitcoin will keep the ability to adapt and protect itself to be replaced by some other crypto currency... 
seriously.. noone seeing that point?
why shouldn't bitcoin be replaced by some other crypto currency with nicer features? because this will hurt scarcity and noone will give a shit about crypto currencies anymore in some years.. because there's always some nice new idea...
make it fixed to 8mb, 20mb or whatever...!
@_date: 2015-06-10 11:29:40
actually this reads like attention whoring with an opinion thats trying ridiculusly hard to be not mainstream..
yeess.. there are other areas we have to put work in but increasing to 20mb is relatively low in complexity and can therefor be addressed BEFORE
@_date: 2015-06-11 14:20:28
very nice!
@_date: 2015-06-12 23:04:52
you're right.. and my masterthesis right now
@_date: 2015-06-10 11:25:03
yea of course.. and we have to solve them one after the other.. -.-
no, seriously.. increasing the blocksize to 20mb and addressing these other concerns is not mutually exclusive..
@_date: 2015-06-16 21:24:14
well good starting point is actually choosing a not bruteforcable pw and not loggin on on every abitrary internet cafe pc

@_date: 2015-06-04 11:02:50
so bitcoin will never be able to handle bursts? bad idea..
make it a fixed cap.. we, the community are the automatism
@_date: 2015-06-16 16:07:11
very nice work!
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:35:15
yea that was a bit my feeling
@_date: 2015-06-10 21:59:36
very suspicious how he still tries to stay kind of neutral ;)
@_date: 2015-06-23 18:44:47
i guess its also bullshit for the deep web and only true if you consider every file on a computer connected to the internet as part of the deep web  (because somehow physically accessible just not easy because not searchable and permissions are missing)
so when you consider every file on every computer somehow connected to a network thats connected to the internet as part of the deep web then yea.. probably you'll get even bigger numbers as that and these numbers will mean nothing
@_date: 2015-06-01 13:34:02
Yess andreas.. you never disappoint!
@_date: 2015-06-13 08:36:36
tell us how it went when you're done
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:54:58
no its not just a channel like the internet. 
it can lock you out. in the internet information can flow around routers that won't let you through. isps cant keep you out of the internet in general (you'll just use someone's wlan or an internet cafe). a full node that doesn't serve you wont be able to make it impossible for you to access the blockchain.. 
but the guy who owns the server is in that case the bottleneck of communication..
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:32:37
yea.. because so many miners want to fuck up bitcoin and make it split.. -.-
@_date: 2015-06-24 21:16:54
how do you want to be able to mine on a side chain..?
coins created on a side chain are possible to move back on the original one? that can't really work.. so a side chain is not really a full alternative to an alternative cryptocurrency in my understanding..
also all these 51% attack scenarios on a side chain add more uncertainty.. to the complexity side chains already added..
go for it.. do it.. but don't force a max size of 1mb to get that through..
@_date: 2015-06-17 14:54:48
sounds very interesting! and the good part.. we basically already have all the tools..!
@_date: 2015-06-10 22:21:17
is offline?
@_date: 2015-06-03 11:55:14
So what's that about localbitcoins in germany? Why isnt it possible to use it here? Is it illegal? So why is mycellium local trader allowed?
And: do you plan to be available again in germany soon?
@_date: 2015-06-03 16:25:10
thx! actually that's a much better answer than the one max gave.
@_date: 2015-06-02 20:41:04

I tell you what I'll do.. if these miners in china really don't get that maxwells, todds and adam blacks opinions do not reflect the user majority and are actually not really reflecting the original vision of bitcoin (which is satoshi's whether you like it or not) then I'll pump my money into litecoin..
its really sad if that would be necessary because i would like bitcoin to be and stay the  cryptocurrency but if chinese miners make that stupid decision we the user have the power to show them that they need us.. pumping litecoin and leaving bitcoin will reduce the price, their mining earnings and since litecoin uses scrypt they cannot just switch with their hardware to mine litecoin!

can't you all just sit at a table and talk like normal grown ups?
@_date: 2015-06-02 18:34:41
ok, in that case we need some kind of addressing beyond the bitcoin address identifying the host, so something coupled to the actual ip.
so how can all the "cyberpunks" like that? its totally far away from being pseudonymous or decentralized
@_date: 2015-06-24 00:52:34
lol you can trade cryptocurrencies on every exchange or shapeshift.io..

used mycellium.
broadcasted in the middle of berlin.. i guess it was broadcasted around the whole globe pretty instant as my counterpart saw the transaction coming and it was directly on blockchain.info
@_date: 2015-06-23 13:30:26
yea like comp21 said. use mycellium and write down the 12 backup words. hide them somewhere in your flat (maybe obscure them).
with these words someone could steal all the bitcoins on your device without touching your device.. but on the other hand you can always recover your bitcoins with them even if you lost your phone
@_date: 2015-06-10 21:53:21
seriousl.. i think it just makes sense that a majority wants an increase.. because.. well.. leaving it at 1 mb and thinking just higher fee's and some more upcoming magic ideas will solve it is just f**ki*g stupid... sorry

Is it that comlicated that you cannot have the advantages of decentralization the blockchain brings without having a token of value..?
@_date: 2015-05-23 23:45:44
no website as a wallet.. use mycellium.. or electrum
@_date: 2015-05-20 20:00:49
which is also ok i guess
@_date: 2015-05-27 09:29:11
or the guy just hacked the website and replaced the address
@_date: 2015-05-30 23:26:56
haha this is so stupid.. i wish i had the time to translate this: 
@_date: 2015-05-21 21:42:57
no what they had is the possiblity to buy token with bitcoins.. i see a huge potential in direct tipping with bitcoins so the eliminated need to really register at the page.
the thing is i stopped at that point where i had to actually pay to see something.. there's too much concurrency for that nowadays.. make it free to view and optional to tip directly in bitcoin.. i guess it would be success
@_date: 2015-05-17 08:48:28

well.. for me right now this whole gbtc thing seems a bit like a scam..
@_date: 2015-05-22 08:09:53

So if everyone has each others xPubkey to not reuse addresses.. now everyone knows all the addresses the other person will use in future.. this is like address reuse again..
i think you miss the point of why address reuse is bad. if you have a friend and you two trust each others i guess it would be ok to create one adress for each other and reuse it just for transfering just between you two.

@_date: 2015-05-30 19:11:35


first: you miss that we're sitting in the same boat.. miners are not playing against us but with us
second: "tricking" wouldnt work as it would still simply be a risk of betting on the wrong fork.. no matter if their vote was faked.. the dont have complete overview about what everyone else will do
@_date: 2015-05-26 10:56:20
dont really get abra. whats the difference to mycellium local trader?
@_date: 2015-05-27 16:44:49


but hey.. to cool thing with bitcoin is that you don't have to.. do it right and don't trust other central authorities
@_date: 2015-05-27 20:44:23

@_date: 2017-02-13 18:28:40
One does not go without the other.
@_date: 2015-05-18 11:19:28
i know but in this case.. its pro bitcoin but also really clearly an investment topic. also without tricking around
@_date: 2015-05-20 19:13:06
if it would be like that and decisions made on the block chain could easily reverted and manipulated by some central authority by just giving some other bitcoins the meaning of that colored coint then why the heck would you use coloured coin and the block chain in the first place?
@_date: 2015-05-20 19:40:54

don't you realize that you're wrong? I really hope that you're not a miner.. that deep missunderstanding shocks me.

thx, almost.
So what you're saying is that the only reason why there were so high fees in Patrick5000's case is that his card was probably not denominated in €?
@_date: 2015-05-30 23:32:16
its not "risk-free".. if the fork succeeds then mining the old chain was the wrong decision

Tell your boss that that's not the kind of transparency that'll lead to success in the bitcoin space
@_date: 2015-05-27 19:48:59
thats just stupid..

and people who bought in at 1000$ and were expecting to get instant millionaires
@_date: 2015-05-31 11:36:00
you are increasing division..
@_date: 2015-05-31 01:55:53
ok, so either i'm indeed getting something wrong or.. 
so if the changing to the new fork gets a success, how is the old fork surviving..?
@_date: 2015-05-03 13:40:22
really nice part by amir
@_date: 2015-05-30 07:49:21
gosh.. again i'm like.. why the f**k wouldn't you post a damn bitcoin address i can donate to on your site..
@_date: 2015-05-27 14:38:30
i think the "bitcoin the new gold standard" talk of their ceo was amazing but besides that i dont know.. the debit cards seems to have too many fees
@_date: 2017-02-19 20:28:11
Don't you understand that it's not about having them but miners actually running them? What part of the hashrate is running Bcoin?
@_date: 2015-05-21 21:53:54
and why can't you change it? i think its best to eliminate all artificial borders and barriers and let the free market decide. to be more concrete: make every option possible for the models.. they can decide if they want to make it obligatory to pay per minute or not. even more flexible to make it possible to switch a pay per minute option on and off. 
but i would guess as most will come through tipping they wouldn't actually do that pay per minute stuff very much as they benefit from a big audience.. 2000 people with some tipping from time to time is better than 3 people watching and paying.
to ensure that you'll get your cut you can be in control of the bitcoin adresses tipped to and transfer it to the models bitcoin adress after taking your cut. 
to ensure that you're not bypassed you can filter bitcoin adresses fromt the chat so that the models cannot simple write their owns. also the site features (like counting the amounts that were tipped and by who'm) would just work with the officially shown bitcoin adress.
to know who tipped you could provide every user a unique bitcoin adress per model to tip to.
just some thoughts
@_date: 2015-05-30 16:26:00
so you're saying there's no way a voting mechanism or possiblity to post a message somewhere for a miner that just solved a block could not help building consenus or at least having an impression about what the people think? 
@_date: 2015-05-11 07:46:15
why is it so absurd? if i'd get that toaster for free, i'd be ok with it..
@_date: 2017-02-13 20:07:55
We don't have to care about decentralization. Giving people the power to chose the money they like is the power that will prevent centralization where it causes harm.
@_date: 2016-01-11 18:47:58




Many miners store the whole blockchain and they have to store the UTXO set in memory.. so they can't just be stupid and don't care how big the blockchain and UTXO set gets..
Also orphan rate is an important point.. so there WILL be network security.. no crippling of bitcoins early phase needed...
@_date: 2015-05-30 10:08:29
cold bitch
@_date: 2015-05-04 15:56:16
at what time?
@_date: 2015-05-30 21:43:20
first of all.. voting would be a slow process, as every 10 minutes one vote would be made that everyone could see.
then there are no miners with such big amounts of hashing power (25%).. you assume that mining pool operators could change the votes over a long time without anyone noticing.
but fine.. lets assume it
STILL it is not a valid attack tactic.. i know the prisoners dilemma.. the difference here is that there is no guranteed medium good outcome in cheating.
lets say you own 25% of the hashing power.. you vote wrong and we have 70% voting for fork 2 while you're working on fork 1. how do you know that no other miner was voting for fork 1 and will actually support fork 2? in that case you would be really screwed.. its actually a bigger risk than a potential gain as it is about getting some percent more vs. getting 100% less...
@_date: 2015-05-25 08:56:54
yep, if you wanna grap a beer at berlins bitcoinbar  i'm in.. i feel like we should do some bitcoin subreddit beer tours anyway

@_date: 2015-05-25 23:34:48
what dickheads.. sadly they don't operate in germany so that i could stop ordering from them :P
@_date: 2015-05-04 09:00:29
cant miners still decides to not put a zero tx fee transaction into a block..? even though there would be space in that block..
i think at a point in time where miners rely on tx fees they would do that, regardless of what the blocksize is
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:07:35
The point to stick to a specific PoW is the asumption that Satoshi consensus actually works and is not broken by some people you don't really have much sympathy for controlling the most hashing power. 
Most people here in think this is not the case. I think it is. Interests with bitcoins PoW are not reacting to the coins interests as fast as e.g. PoS but eventually they will.
Satoshi was right, bitcoin works how it is designed and time will show that.
@_date: 2015-01-29 13:38:33
good one :) 1$ @_date: 2017-02-19 18:43:48
So this would be an argument for having only one mainstream client. Don't you understand that the whole network gets more resilient when several different clients are running? 
@_date: 2017-02-13 20:50:31
The strength of bitcoin is that there's no formal barrier to participate in mining just an economic one. This will keep bitcoin decentralized enough. In times of choice economic actors have to care about what people (users) want.
Also, I use bitcoin and there's nothing you can do about it. It's not on you to define whether I need bitcoin or not.
@_date: 2015-01-31 13:20:12
Very interesting. Thanks for the efford! 6000 bits Maybe you could publish a paper about that?
@_date: 2016-03-22 15:34:20
I would say a system that implies acting for the good of the system to increase profits mid to long term is pretty awesome.
One does not simply acquire 51% of the worlds hashing power and then say "fuck bitcoin, burn them farms down".
@_date: 2016-03-05 11:36:09
please.. just stfu. i wouldn't even agree to argue against this..
just one point: where's your data-driven analysis that your segwit + 2mb in 2017 roadmap will not cause major damage..
@_date: 2015-01-22 17:51:03
inflation costs everyone who owns bitcoins money. so in principal there's no difference how it is payed, via transaction fees or via inflation. just that transaction fees make more sense because the act that causes work (sending money) costs money, not just possessing it
@_date: 2015-05-29 11:04:46
how can they base the seed ONLY on the stuff they get from random.org -.-

@_date: 2015-05-27 09:49:55
i don't think developers consenus is the problem here.. i guess the miners are more on the skeptical side here
@_date: 2016-03-22 20:22:48
hahaha.. nice move
@_date: 2015-01-22 20:01:01
yea actually that's why i suggested giving bitcoin to random people on the internet..
@_date: 2017-02-02 10:20:53
We cannot enforce consensus when it is simply not there. The question is whether it's better to stay in a deadlock or split if no consensus is possible.
@_date: 2015-05-27 23:51:09
my point is.. i think its crucial that miners are people interested in the technology and able to take part in the discussion and have an informed opinion whether or not to update to a new version that causes a hard fork.. 
if everyone mines (which the mine with your toaster and light bulb attempt implies) then that could shift..
@_date: 2016-03-19 19:55:55
well first of all she's not reading from but from 
secondly its not really conspiracy as it is a known fact that blockstream pays core devs.. luke jr. even stated publicly that he's not getting payed by bitcoins users.. but his customer is who pays him.. now guess who that might be... -.-
@_date: 2016-01-25 22:38:49
:D ok, think that
@_date: 2015-01-28 15:10:05
you're right.. that's the point i was missing.. even though the developers might implement some changes, miners wouldn't have to upgrade to that new version
@_date: 2015-05-30 20:45:13
ok, lets say you're right and miners are absolutely not able to see the bigger picture and that having no consensus will harm themselves.
i still don't see how a false vote will benefit them.
the situation you described is not making sense. lets say i as miner vote for fork 2 but mine fork 1. fork 2 has 70% of the votes so i'll still just lose all the work of mining fork 1 because probably fork 2 will still win even without me.
what you describe could only be done by miners having several percent of the mining power. And we're not talking about mining pools here..! being in a pool miners could still vote individually.. 
so if there was really a single miner with about 5% of the hashing power to have an impact with his false vote than he's that big and dependend on bitcoin that he would likely see the bigger picture and that such bullshit would fuck up the value of his bitcoins.. the other thing is that he'd likely be identified after doing this and get a good amount of shitstorm.. maybe the network will ignore him..
@_date: 2016-03-24 12:46:59
lol.. so basically they removed satoshi nakamoto and gavin adresen.. 2 persons they don't agree with

@_date: 2015-05-30 17:30:42
no.. the incentive for miners is consenus and not damaging the reputation (and in this way also price) of bitcoin(s). that would be the case if 2 versions keep running for a long time
@_date: 2015-05-04 15:58:04
yep, she totally fucked up.. 
she could have had said it's just cryptic addresses on the blockchain but she used names xD
@_date: 2016-03-05 11:31:31
please tell me there's an /s missing..
@_date: 2015-05-03 18:47:43
what am i missing here? thought with max 7 transaction per second the max is at 4200 transaction all 10 mins (block). so we already are kind of at the maximum?
@_date: 2015-05-30 15:42:51
in the end they have that power anyway.. they'll install the version or not.. the voting mechanism would just improve the communication.. right now noone really knows if we would be able to do it or not
@_date: 2016-01-30 20:06:16
gosh.. can they make this even more boring? this voice... -.-
@_date: 2016-03-22 10:01:15
tomtomtom7 is spot on.. we cannot talk about selfish miners and then ignore the negative effect on the bitcoin price a totally selfish miner pushing everyone else out of business would have
@_date: 2015-05-13 14:02:42
well, your answer/question sounds funny but is still bullshit. a bad comparision.
the monkey will cost me additional money. using a toaster that consumes engergy anyway will not.
and yea maybe the toaster isn't the best example because it doesn't need energy constantly.. maybe something like a water boilder would be better here

finally a bitcoin webcam side.. nice BUT.. some things:
- its a nice functionality bitcoin has i know but actually for webcam girls i think tipping is better than a constant bitcoin flow per minute. Make it possible to tip bitcoin without the need to pay to view.
- show actual images from the live video chat in the overview
- its still too expensive but i guess that will change when more people use it..
take a look at  its an example for a really well realized system. just without bitcoin.. your chance here..
@_date: 2015-05-21 21:43:54
haha :D
@_date: 2015-05-28 10:49:55
Thats why i view the upcoming 20 mb hard fork as crucial for bitcoin.. if i succeess it kind of teaches less caring engaged miners to keep an eye on whats happening!
@_date: 2015-05-27 09:35:43
i think it's important that you don't cleanup your phone but make it possible to further investigate what happened to it and how

@_date: 2016-01-26 15:20:58
yes, that's what i was saying. if you're not informed enough i think you're doing right in assuming that something is a scam.. but as you are not informed enough you shouldn't be that verbal about it.
paul sztorc will only say bad things about augur as he hates them and that they took his idea, didnt follow exactly everything he said and will now not continue to play with him. if you investigate a bit further you will discover his troll-like behavior. augurs beta will launche in 1 or 2 month so we can discuss this as much as we want.. we will see in 1 or 2 month anyway... 
and well.. i can understand that one uninformed opinion (influenced by paul sztorc) might think that augur is a scam.. but ethereum too..? please.. i can't take you serious about that
@_date: 2016-01-23 13:26:55
i think you just didn't get it
@_date: 2015-05-27 16:39:51
ok monthly fees are covered.. thats nice! but to spend money they list a fee of 3%.. so is it completely payed by the seller? or will i have some fees (maybe hidden in exchange rates)

@_date: 2016-01-10 13:58:33
His argument that without a blocksize limit the fees will be at zero and miners will eventually go away is very short sighted. For the fee to be at 0 a majority of miners would have to accept zero fee transactions.. why should they? miners can still chose whether they include transactions or not. Its much more desireable to let miners learn the fact that they have to make reasonable decisions about what transactions to include and then let the market decide as to let someone dictate an artificial limit..!﻿

@_date: 2017-03-06 12:36:08
we also have that in bitcoin.. both fundamental differences in views are blocking each other. 
It's force layer 2 solutions and use bitcoin as settlement layer vs. let both layers freely compete against each other. I think the benefit of trying both paths at the same time would outweight the drawback of initial confusion about 2 coins.
@_date: 2016-01-10 22:11:49
it has cpu costs, bandwith costs and storage costs.. additionally it increases the orphan rate.. if including transactions would be for free than fine.. lets have free transactions.. since this is not the case it will never happen..
@_date: 2017-03-11 12:19:58

It will be a compromise at least. I consider myself and I would prefer BU but if a segwit hard fork with 2mb base block size would be released I'd be happy if it activates.
@_date: 2017-08-30 09:11:24
Me this month
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:13:04
It doesn't.. stop your annoying propaganda.
It makes more data fit into 1 MB block such that compared to current data format it is comparable with 2MB. But that's a difference to 2MB blocks. 
Demanding a 2MB hard fork is a clear statement against a messy soft fork policies that try to somehow trick clients just to avoid a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-08-29 11:26:00
We have segwit now.. so.. go for it.
@_date: 2016-11-12 14:46:59

of course bitcoin is dominating.. but this domination is less then it was and goes on fading.. this is not a contradiction.
@_date: 2016-12-25 21:57:11
I'm doing a lot of things with bitcoin but even if you're just holding.. it's a start. 
The more people hold the more people have already set up a wallet, know how to receive bitcoin and perceive it as something with value. Just the willingness of people to accept bitcoin as something with value is very important. The more of them there are the easier it is for two of these people to meet. When two people who perceive bitcoin as something with value want to transact then they can do it directly in Bitcoin.

But that's the point where i don't agree! You cannot compare Bitcoin XT to ethereum..! Do you really believe that its the correct way to give a bunch of core devs total control? If the majority thinks that they're abusing their control / are wrong or whatever and that we should do a hardfork by running XT then who are you to say that shouldn't be discussed openly? Even when you claimed control over this subreddit here first we should be able to discuss it here.. because XT is NOT an altcoin..!

sorry, but seriously google up some information before you trust someone with your bitcoins.. i did that a long time ago and wouldnt trust igot
@_date: 2015-08-11 23:49:09
damn! that was helpful.. these bots get more an more useful
@_date: 2015-08-11 14:07:21
For now i don't know a single altcoin that didn't intend to be an altcoin.. XT doesn't want to split bitcoin but fix it.. 
so people adopting it doesn't want to split bitcoin but evolve it.. so.. it is about intention. not just the intention of the developers but also the intention of everyone using/mining it.
if you want to doom people for having this intention than you give full control to the bitcoin core devs and centralize bitcoin this way..!
@_date: 2015-08-11 23:23:46
pretty misleading.. i looked it up, its even 2 bolivar notes.. thus 3500 of these would make 7000.. on the picture are way more than 3500 notes..
also.. what did you calculate? 1 Bolivar is displayed as 0,000422€ right now so 7000 would actually be even less BTC (0,012)
edit: well ok 500 notes per package could be right.. still 7000 vef is less than 0,13 btc
@_date: 2015-08-12 23:03:41
damn.. :/ but common.. 100btc in a hot wallet..??
@_date: 2015-08-11 12:58:42
apart from all his savings are hold physical in his safe..
i think it would be good to save a fraction of these bitcoins on a usb stick (at more than 1 location) but encrypted so you cannot be victim to physical theft
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:45:13
its not a conspiracy.. he just pointed out that there is that incentive.. maybe for some of the guys from blockstream this point is not important, maybe for some its more important, but thats not what he speculated about.. he just pointed out that there is an incentive.. how is that not true / a conspiracy?

I wouldn't say its the only way. take part in the discussion and be a thoughtful member of the community. when it comes to a hard forks its also the users deciding which will be the future bitcoin main chain in chosing e.g. exchanges that support the right fork
@_date: 2015-08-07 19:59:26
Here's another one from myself: ALMOST every ablsolute statement is wrong.
@_date: 2015-08-05 19:42:53
I think even that
@_date: 2015-08-11 23:17:30
but thats more than 7000 vef on the picture, right? i mean.. its way more than 7000 bills...

@_date: 2015-08-07 11:01:19
bullshit argumentation, bullshit conclusion..
one implementation gives centralized control over bitcoin to whoever is in charge of that repository (even if its 20-30 people thats not good)
concerning security it is also a very bad idea to only have one implementation. no software is bulletproof against security holes and the reason why noone can take the whole internet down with e.g. a worm is not that there's any part in it that's not hackable.. no, its heterogeneity. We need heterogeneity in the software nodes and miners and all the other network participants run to make bitcoin unhackable..!
Think of it as the needed diversity in biological live to prevent whole populations to be wiped out by some virus or other illnesses..
@_date: 2015-08-16 22:25:01
One fork is an altcoin, yes. But who are you to decide which fork? The majority has to decide. 
Saying that in every case that bitcoin core is forked the other fork is an altcoin and bitcoin core's fork is the 'real bitcoin' would give centralized control to the guys with commit access to bitcoin core. A central point of failure. The special thing with bitcoin is, that we don't need central points of failure anymore and even more, we should avoid them..! no group of 10-20 people should be totally in charge of bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-11-18 10:07:52
come on.. dont be that context-blind. pointing fingers on bugs in response to someone bragging about the high quality of his own project and insulting the other project as buggy, untested bad quality code..? seems legit
@_date: 2015-07-15 16:30:16
I experienced it a lot that waiting 10 minutes would have been totally fine (selling bitcoin for cash) but 30-40 minutes was just really annoying. Some people want that 1 confirmation. So having intervals of e.g. 2.5 minutes would make waiting times like 30-40 mins way more unlikely than now. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 11:09:12
exactly what i thought :D
@_date: 2015-07-07 09:46:58
and I call bullshit on this.. ultimately we NEED the situation that there are many many transactions with fees as the block solving reward has to be completely replaced by tx fees eventually.. 
its just stupid and short sighted to see valid transacitons with fees as a thread
@_date: 2015-07-28 12:58:48
He is the filmmaker of "Bitcoin: The end of money as we know it". I personally thought the trailer was &gt;a bit over the top&lt; but in this interview he seems like a thoughtful person and I trust him with making a good documentary. I didn't see it until now but I'll buy it for bitcoin today later. My feeling is, that this documentary could be a good one (better and more differenciated than the trailer might suggest)
@_date: 2015-07-14 11:40:37
but maybe telling people about it there now will help for the next crisis

@_date: 2015-07-21 11:45:08
I'm more for this than for BIP 100.. even though i would prefer even bigger blocks
@_date: 2015-08-12 23:17:10
i think there are thousands of bitcoin experts out there.. not tens of thousands, but thousands.. so please stop assuming that people writing on the bitcoin dev. list are THE set of expert existing and we have to take them as THE source of wisdom.
Let the wisdom of the crowd decide! And i think the bitcoin crowd is one of the most intelligent ones..
@_date: 2015-08-12 09:59:11
XT will not destroy us all.. and I'm ok with the doubling every 2 years too but for the sake of unity i would be ok to just go to 8mb now first.
XT is what we desperately need in the bitcoin community.. another implementation.. we need even more than just XT and core.. we have to diversify. If everyone is running core than 1 single security bug could destroy the whole bitcoin network!
@_date: 2015-08-11 13:02:45
no it doesn't.. because its an unbelievable stupid idea to call XT an altcoin.. sad that some people like you are buying this shit
@_date: 2015-08-04 10:21:34
THANK YOU..! very nice! 1000 bits (sent some more directly to your address)
@_date: 2015-07-15 11:56:25
we should all donate a bit to mycellium from time to time, as i do not really see how they make revenue..
also i think they should include a sponsors button (not a donate button, i know this caused problems) in the app where they show some ad banners to people who click it
@_date: 2015-07-20 16:42:12
its a free world.. that means he can suggest whatever he wants on his bitcoin domain.. and i will/can/do not want to stop him from doing so. he could also take money for just suggesting some sponsored stuff... but at the same time i can state that i think what he does sucks.. also part of being in a free world..
and his "private property" fulfills the function of displaying information to the PUBLIC... so why wouldn't the pulbic be allowed to talk about it? whats your problem?
@_date: 2015-07-08 08:39:47
so, is it you? 
@_date: 2015-07-13 16:22:53
actually it would just require a server with some software to make a file look like a stream to streamium.io
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:49:35
you missed the words 'to scale' I'm sure it was not on purpose ;)
@_date: 2015-07-14 08:49:13
NYC? not a good idea..
especially to support buying bitcoins used on backpage..
@_date: 2015-07-18 08:03:25
soo.. like bitcoin.de
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:43:55
You're right 300000 bits would be more. what he meant was 3000 bits (21000000/7000000000)
so the point here is, that you don't need to invest that much to be "on the boat" buy your 10$ btc per week and i guess when you continue that for a bout 1 year you will at least have 1 btc.. that makes you one in a million with 7 billion people we have
@_date: 2015-07-31 11:44:33
why a link.. but yea sure.. would be possible.. you could encode e.g. the 12 words of an electrum or mycellium seed as an url parameter (would kind of look like a session id)
but why a link.. a simple message with 12 words would be enough
@_date: 2015-07-07 08:40:35
thats actually bullshit.. it couldn't harm bitcoin as miners getting 20mbs of fees every 10 minutes would just be happy about it.. it would just cause 0 fee transactions to be not processed anymore 
@_date: 2015-07-28 03:02:41
40000 or 90000?
@_date: 2015-07-21 01:28:10
just because it doesn't contain the word "bitcoin" it isn't off-topic..
vulnerabilities like that are important to know for people who save btc on their machines
@_date: 2015-07-13 13:31:46
So who are they selling it to?
@_date: 2015-07-07 08:34:56
so did the same yesterday with the same fee (2 inputs 2 outputs) and it took about 2 hours
@_date: 2015-07-19 12:41:51
So when i read Bitcoin_Error_Log's announcement I immediately thought that the results of someone doing these researches can only be biased... so Bitcoin_Error_Log, you asked for it, you got it, i think you should pay your 5 BTC.
@_date: 2015-07-01 14:15:28
no it comes down to what direction bitcoin should go to create the biggest and most benificial social impact. you will not get that far with hard facts there because when it comes to society you're facing a complex and chaotic system.
@_date: 2015-07-29 19:32:27
nice, but to be clear.. you made it with photoshop, right?
@_date: 2015-07-30 00:16:53
sad thing is.. they're kind of right with it.. bitcoin has the network effect advantage.. it must really screw up for an altcoin to overtake it
so actually thats good but not when maxwell &amp; co go on crippling bitcoin
@_date: 2015-07-15 20:15:23
dude.. stop talking.. 
its not mutal exclusive.. having shorter confirmation times isn't decreasing security...
of course halfing conf times will make a confirmation half as secure but for the same amount of security you would just wait twice as many confirmations.. its about more granularity as in many cases 0 confs is not enough and 1 conf is way more than we need..
@_date: 2015-07-30 00:29:19
and I am not a robot ;)
@_date: 2015-07-24 15:15:14
I would say give some away and challenge them to get either money or other stuff for it as close at the actual value of the btcs you gave away as possible
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:19:34
it still makes sense. having this opinion already before and being now also biased by another financial motive is not mutually exclusive
@_date: 2015-07-12 10:18:47
haha, the message changed a bit ;)
its less aggressive now and they say its because of regulations.. but still. they should do the right move and simply move away from a city with such (bitcoin crippling) regulations.. (NY)
@_date: 2015-08-04 22:57:52
@_date: 2015-07-20 13:56:35
so why is he having this website where he is always suggesting 1 wallet (ninki wallet for windows?) not not even showing the others?? obviosly he got paid for that.. and these donation addresses... its kind of scamming
@_date: 2015-07-07 08:28:45
thanks you're right.. that makes more sense
@_date: 2015-07-13 16:26:45
so how do you read articles there right now? you make a free account? why shouldn't that work while charging 25 cent from people that don't want to create an account?
@_date: 2015-07-03 10:00:22
wasn't that known for quite a long time now?
@_date: 2015-07-18 08:03:30
like bitcoin.de
@_date: 2015-07-15 16:21:52
maybe we really should think about decreasing confirmation times (e.g. 2.5 minutes like ltc or dash)

good advice man.. next time i redo my computer i'll also make an offline linux partition! currently i have 1 windows and 1 ubuntu.. then i'll have 1 windows and 2 with ubuntu (1 online &amp; 1 offline).

I use it to encrypt my files, i know its open source but actually i just downloaded the binary and i think it not built deterministically

some minutes (i think 3) maybe longer but i closed the window.
@_date: 2015-07-29 18:46:03
Aaand again, maxwell steps in..
Gregory Maxwell:


It now starts to be about who has more right to be an autority on bitcoin. Maxwell tells us about how he imagines bitcoin will/should be. 
The truth is, why do we care? I have the feeling that the majority of bitcoin users is for an increase and that's what counts. Lets just make it happen and then lets see who will still mine on the 1 mb chain. Maybe Todd, Maxwell &amp; Co will finally have their 1 mb fork without all the other stupid people on it.. that fork it will hurt bitcoin but it will survive because the majority will be on the &gt;8 mb chain anyway...
@_date: 2015-07-27 18:06:22

'It's obvious' is a bad argument.

@_date: 2015-07-14 11:52:30

yea but you're still vulnerable to the theft of your trezor, right?
@_date: 2015-07-21 11:41:20
I'm against it because it represents the misleading view that miners are the only ones to vote about this. It should be made clear that miners are only one part of the bitcoin steakholders. They have all the hashing power, yes but the choice users and exchanges make also plays a major role.
This BIP is sending a false signal

whatever is more secure.. noone "deserves to get robbed"..
@_date: 2015-07-21 14:47:19
the question is if miners are already smart enough about this.. 
listening to all this "we need smaller blocks to increase fees"-shit makes me think they might be not smart enough about this.. 
maybe they will in some decades..

no i mean YOU..
you read 20 articles a day that actually require a subscription via reddit posts?!
come on, are you acting like this on purpose as if you won't get the point?
if the articles you read right now are all free then why should that change because of bitcoin.. their model is commercials or something else.. but if a model is direct money from the reader, like apparently wall street journals business model than adding a bitcoin option for people who just want a single article from time to time won't hurt..!
@_date: 2015-07-08 20:21:29

@_date: 2015-07-01 07:38:58
I'm working at a university, am in contact with many very clever minds and my impression is that even though the core devs you named are clearly experts with a lot a knowledge this question comes down to intuition. And I have seen many great scientists with bad intuition.
With the block size debate we shouldn't underestimate the "wisdom of the crowd" (which became quite popular through augur now).
So yea.. adam, todd and co. are clever guys and did a lot for bitcoin but i would say in this case they have either bad intuition or (more or less) hidden motives..! And in my opinion its ok for people to be concerned about that (but yes.. we shouldn't get personal)
@_date: 2015-07-20 12:16:37
what is it with this roger ver.. it's strange.. the first time I saw him I didn't like him.. even though he's into bitcoin (which means a lot for me ;) ) and he's a scammer..  is it visible in his face, that he is?
@_date: 2016-02-24 20:49:07
We shouldn't have to give a flying f*ck about who has git access in a scenario where everything is opensource and everyone choses freely which code he runs.. We should try to get there with bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-08-24 18:41:11
I'd prefer to stay with bitcoin

@_date: 2015-07-01 16:25:14
no in my opinion it doesn't make sense to stick with bitcoin then. 
bitcoins only real advantage over all other altcoins is not technical rather than that it has the best distribution so far. Its the network effect that will make bitcoin successful and mass adoption IS the best way to have the biggest positiv impact with it all the benefits a cryptocurrency can bring to society. If you like other features like anonymity or absolute decentralization that do not depend on mass adoption then why stick with bitcoin? services like shapeshift already provide on the fly conversion right now.

this is kind of an argument for my position.. What happened to make it possible for you to watch HD videos online? Did someone fine tune some compression, made tcp work way smarter and more efficient? Partly maybe, yes, but mainly just the bandwidth got increased

thats exactly the mental fail i get so frustrated about the last weeks..
The bitcoin network with its current hashing rate will NEVER be completely financeable by the amount of transactions we have right now. With our current transaction numbers fees would have to be that high, that we criple a big aspect of additional value bitcoin brings so people will just stop using it..!
Our digital gold CAN be send around the world very cheap and easy.. lets not destroy that..!
@_date: 2016-02-23 21:19:18
come on.. i was there when downloading an mp3 took about an hour over napster.. it was mp3 compression the same we have today...
of course video formats compression improved but also the bandwidth increased drastically.. its pointless to fight what improved more with respect to the other.. the thing is.. both factors improved without artificially constrainting one of them

In one sense a paper wallet is less secure than cash. For the paper wallet its enough to see it to steal the money. Cash must be really stolen to be stolen.
If you safe it on a paper wallet make sure noone can ever see it.
@_date: 2016-02-23 19:16:10
I'm not saying its bad.. I published that in my personal opinion (also as a geek and computer science master absolvent): It will not happen.

"You cannot build something decentralized on top of something centralized" - gregory maxwell
me: uhm.. what about the internet itself? its driven by big companies and datacenters.. so its just kind of semi-decentralized as you dont want bitcoin to be.. so following your own logic we cannot build a perfectly decentralized bitcoin on top of it anyway.. i would argue having big datacenters mining bitcoin will always be sufficiently decentralized.
@_date: 2015-07-28 19:18:33
is Bitcoin Direct  ?
@_date: 2015-07-28 20:27:48
yep thats good. important to keep your software up to date as security holes like that will always be possible.
but unfortunately even though google fixed it, e.g. users of samsung galaxy phones etc will have to wait until samsung rolls that update out.. 
rooting your phone wouldn't be an alternative for me as i would have to trust a custom made android and root access for programs is possible
@_date: 2016-02-24 21:18:26
no but in an envrionment where thousands of people are watching its enough when every release one of these thousands of people does
@_date: 2016-02-24 23:13:13
its not trusting random third parties.. you can chose trusted nodes.
And nodes don't have to be miners
@_date: 2015-07-24 15:12:52
yep.. deserve the pride
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:06:00
Right now price is rising alot so don't be disappointed if it goes doewn a bit again the next weeks.. see it as a long term investment with money you dont need the next years!
@_date: 2015-07-13 18:39:24
that sounds pretty awesome
@_date: 2016-02-23 23:44:23
its not even released yet..
@_date: 2016-02-01 16:45:30
well, actually your homepage tells everything i need to know :D will keep you in mind! :) 
@_date: 2016-02-01 12:45:47
He underestimates the power of choice bitcoin introduces. We can now chose our currency and are not forced to use a certain single one. Because of that miners would never blacklist as people would turn their back on bitcoin, move to other cryptocurrencies and miners would devalue their own income..!
@_date: 2016-02-12 18:20:48
e.g. the reward halving is only a problem for miners when the bitcoin price does not doule every two years. I think it can.
But lets say it does not.. then only half the number of miners left.. still bitcoin would be fine with that
@_date: 2015-07-13 07:45:26
damn.. didn't really know her but already dislike her
@_date: 2016-09-14 23:08:10
yes but my concerns are how hard it would be for the producers of that device to guess a private key generated by that device.. so if they could somehow predict the random outcome of the device they themself fabricated it would only be the entropy of the files left.
that sounds like a lot but its still not the best entropy i can think of.. so the crucial part is how the hardware generated nonce works in detail
@_date: 2016-09-08 15:21:08
So the only thing that tells us it that random-ize.org has a really bad word list (if they have in the first place) and shouldn't be used to form an opinion on how hard to guess a password is.
Firefox is definitely a bad and easy to guess password.
@_date: 2016-09-14 22:42:06
so basically for the creators it's just the entropy of all existing files to guess the average user has on his desktop which is way less then any possible 160 random bits
@_date: 2016-02-24 08:47:41
sorry but.. i understand the lightning network. 
Doesn't mean i will implement it in the application for bitcoin I'm building right now
@_date: 2016-09-14 16:30:34
are the files the only source of entropy? so if i enter the same files twice will it be the same address?
@_date: 2016-09-13 20:43:21
still a video about Craig Wright there...
shame on you washingtonpost.. shame on you

@_date: 2015-04-08 00:44:56
@_date: 2015-04-13 15:43:28
so who safes it and broadcasts it once its valid?
@_date: 2015-04-10 09:59:33
so yea.. just make a read only paper wallet to safe bitcoins long term.. you have to write down on paper something anyway (also for trezor)
@_date: 2015-04-12 22:44:25
if you need someone repackaging it from germany just write me a mesage
@_date: 2015-04-12 22:14:24
you can combine that with multi sig 
@_date: 2015-04-15 00:46:32
@_date: 2015-04-15 00:48:57
actually bitcoins inflation rate would also decrease if the reward wouldn't halve every 4 years as a constant reward is each time a little less compared to the amount of existing coins
@_date: 2015-04-12 22:13:27
why so complicated.. just get a safe with a paper wallet and tell them its in there..
@_date: 2015-04-20 08:01:24
so do you have fees to prevent faking reputation? or how will you do that?
@_date: 2015-04-12 22:26:50
really thought of buying some.. but the shipping price of 16$ kind of destroyed that plan.. :/
@_date: 2015-04-10 00:22:08
don't forget that a thieve would actually have to steal your trezor hardware from you first and then would need some time..
@_date: 2015-04-15 20:18:50
well.. to be fair.. the world IS that way that for now real technical improvements always made their way on the top

whats your website?
@_date: 2015-04-04 12:21:18
I wish you all the best :) 
you seem like a curious and smart person, thats a good combination.
maybe once you digged all your way through this in the beginnig a bit complex looking field you can help others you know and tell them about it :)
Just one thing to add: 
i know.. i'm a very suspicious person, that's why i always would place such a second backup in an envelope and at least obsured it a bit like i mentioned. even if i hand it to my parents. the reason is not because i think my parents would steal it but that they could underestimate the importance of it being seen by noone. if you would give them money someone would have to take it. but if you give them the 12 words then someone would just have to see them. seeing them (or e.g. taking a quick picture) equals taking them from you (or at least being able to at any time). 
a bit of word swapping doesn't hurt ;) not because you dont trust the person you hand it over to 
@_date: 2015-04-13 15:34:23
thats what i was pointing to with "you can combine that with multi sig" e.g. when you have 3 relatives you could do the following:
give all your relatives a key, make it a 4 of 5 multisig, put 2 keys into the safe.
@_date: 2015-09-02 10:44:34
I see so many people here falling for that propaganda.. its sad..
@_date: 2015-09-21 21:17:26
ok now move your eyes even a bit higher and read that one comment above the comment you linked so kindly. 
  &gt; I can't imagine there's not prior art in the bitcoin space regarding this with all the talk of remittances. Wonder if we can dig some up?
he: it doesn't matter
me: it does.. because there's now 18 month time until they'll get it
that was all it was about

"truly safe" in the sense of putting big amounts of btc to an online hot wallet..
@_date: 2015-09-30 22:10:30
? 
what're you talking about?
@_date: 2015-09-11 10:30:12
its about the centralizesd pressure and power to propagate an opinion one core dev circle has..
the core protocol must be able to change if the majority wants it to change..!
@_date: 2015-04-04 11:53:48
great! but be sure you can trust the person you give the second paper backup. With that 12 words on the paper they can take all the bitcoins. I would recommend to obscure it a bit, e.g. you could swap the first and last word or something like that.
and put it in a sealed envelope.
PS: encryption is actually not that hard to use. its just choosing a (strong) passwort and protecting a file with it. e.g.  a programm to archive files in a zip file offers an option (right click -&gt; add to archive) to choose a password for the archive. If you choose a password of length &gt;= 10 with numbers, big and small letters and some special sign which dont follow the easiest rules of substituting some letters with num83rs ;) than it would be really safe. not even the nsa could crack it. you could give that file with your bitcoin seed written in it (like a simple txt file) to anyone without them being able to see what written inside.
@_date: 2015-04-13 15:41:23
yep i guess i would
@_date: 2015-09-08 17:45:04
i don't think so
@_date: 2015-09-07 09:12:44
not really
@_date: 2015-04-12 22:16:24
so if everyone did this we'd have a lot of garbage broadcasted around, spamming the network?
@_date: 2015-09-25 20:09:09
"the release of virtual currency"? so what does that mean? selling? creating? accepting? giving away for free?
@_date: 2015-09-21 21:31:14
seriously.. i read your comment..
try to see your linked comment in the context of the comment that linked comment is answering to....
he is clearly implying that it doesn't matter if there is prior art available because its too expensive to go to court and make that point.. my point was.. right now and the next 18 month its not expensive...
ps: what's wrong with you?
@_date: 2015-09-03 21:14:16
nice idea
@_date: 2015-09-16 16:01:11
This will never be the case as since altcoins exist we have a multi dimensional competing free market. A single central miner will lead to an extreme devaluation of bitcoin making it not profitable at all to be that single profitable miner compared to being one of many mining something that actually has value.
@_date: 2015-04-07 15:30:01
still quite a lot for it being 3% (12$) to transfer from here to ghana or kenya
@_date: 2015-09-08 12:14:08
I'm in :) 
@_date: 2015-04-18 13:15:17
its actually wrong.. noone understood it that way
@_date: 2015-09-16 20:06:10
i see this as a way more fluid process, less as a point in time everyone will notice that bitcoin is now centralized and go to an altcoin. more and more centralization would lead to stronger and stronger getting altcoins. In a world where bitcoin took over and a wide range of people adopted it masses would suddenly be way more flexible.. Its a huge efford to move (masses) away from fiat to bitcoin but once we are in the world of cryptocurrencies switching gets way easier.. see e.g. shapeshift and how it enables everyone who accepts bitcoin by simply using their api to accept all kinds of crypto currencies which get on the fly converted to the currency of choice. and i think this is just the beginning. I always was only pro bitcoin for quite some time but since some month i really see a big value in having alternatives.. even if its just to keep some pressure on bitcoin
@_date: 2015-09-30 22:22:12
It's not only forced when some authority comes and says it has to be that way.. when the underlying principles and dynamics determine that outcome pretty certain its also kind of forced
@_date: 2015-09-22 00:59:52
yea.. assuming the block size gets not increased..
@_date: 2015-09-08 17:47:34
I think there should be a hard fork.. yes..
it will not kill bitcoin.. maybe weaken it for some month/weeks.. thats the real power of decentralization.. let it fork and then we'll see which side gets picked on the long run.. competition is good..!
@_date: 2015-09-23 19:33:45
if the price goes up probably also the hashrate goes up
@_date: 2015-09-30 11:56:42
cointorrent.. what a lame boring name
@_date: 2015-09-02 10:51:41
My impression is that maxwell formulated a total general letter, that just did not really have any message and sounds positive to get as many others to sign it. This way he wants to make it look like they're all standing behind him which i cannot believe. that would be fairly disappointing and i would wonder how so many people like that could happen to bitcoin. 
this letter is propaganda and i can't wait for the day bitcoin gets rid of people like maxwell, todd, luke &amp; co
@_date: 2015-09-21 18:17:22
i dont know what these fees mean.. 
what i can say is that it is important to distinguish between a patent and a patent application.. and it takes minimum 18 month from the time of registration to become a patent
@_date: 2015-09-22 18:58:36
good job. congratz

so use the BIB101 only xt version..
@_date: 2015-09-21 17:45:37
well it does matter. the way patents work makes them invalid if it was already out there before it was registered
@_date: 2015-09-17 11:58:59
Ok, now think and imagine the situation in year 2140 when there's no block reward anymore.
Do you honestly think it wouldn't work anymore? Yes for every tx you add you increase your income but in the end you still have to get this block accepted by the majority of the other miners. a giant block which gets not accepted is worth nothing
@_date: 2015-09-16 19:29:48
so how about sharing your knowledge a bit your highness
@_date: 2015-09-29 10:09:59
alright cowboy, sorry that i was speaking bad about your muricah
@_date: 2015-09-03 14:44:32
yes.. and bitcoin as a settlement network for large players WILL be a centralized less valuable bitcoin.. 
i think we're on the same side here..
lightning will bring centralization.. just a few but very expensive onchain transaction being possible will bring centralization.. having blocks of 8mb or even 8gb in 32 years will NOT bring centralization...
of course a maximal decentralized ideal version would be nice but it is about trade offs.. if that in theory perfect, maximal decentralized bitcoin can only be used by a handful of people it will change nothing.. a failed experiment... mainstream adoption is crucial for bitcoin to have its biggest impact on society.. 
ones it is adopted people are on the crypto currency train and will always easily be able to hop on another one (less centralized altcoin) if bitcoin really would end up being centralized.. but i'm pretty sure that wouldnt happen because of BIP101.. maybe because we didn't increase and went on to lightning..
@_date: 2015-09-18 17:41:11
actually its different.. but yea.. smart contracts
@_date: 2015-09-26 13:54:02
Don't you understand that exacltly THIS is one revolutionarry aspect of cryptocurrencies, that they can be all these things..? In near future we will have few big cryptocurrencies (network effect) and it will be those that have all of these properties.
@_date: 2015-09-25 08:57:42
thats good.. be efficient.
@_date: 2015-09-07 08:44:34
you're statements are always the same "person a (pro blocksize increase) claimes something ridiculous and should be honored that I even answer", "person b (blockstream employee or someone else contra blocksize increase) is right"
@_date: 2015-09-03 16:05:05


i dont know if thats preferable.. i think miners should have an incentive to take part at discussions and think themselves whats best for bitcoin..
@_date: 2015-09-25 06:32:41
patent applications are always public
@_date: 2015-09-20 09:44:46
well.. firstly for being wrong. (formulating it in an absolute sentence like that makes him definitely being wrong)
secondly for being blockstreams ceo
@_date: 2015-09-08 18:21:43
you're right.. its sadly not enough. 
@_date: 2015-09-07 09:08:58
i think this "your debate is toxic"-narrative is one blockstream created.. 
how can a debate be toxic? how else do you want to solve the situation that there are opposing ideas and opposing thoughts? debating.. right.. its not always fun and maybe also exhausting but just telling the people who are going through it that this is toxic and putting your head back into the sand.. well done..
@_date: 2015-04-04 00:54:42
but the thing you shouldn't forget is that once you leave your private key at home (e.g. as a qr code or 12 written words on a paper) this is the only option to send bitcoins from your address. if you lose that paper all the bitcoins are gone! no person on earth could ever find them and give them back to you. So if for example your flat burnes down and the paper with the qr code also burnes all bitcoins are gone (if you had a watch-only wallet without the private key).
As as long as you dont have huge amounts of bitcoin on that address it's proably okay to just take that risk. but if there are several thousand dollars worth in bitcoin i would place a second backup somewhere else (your parents house in a sealed envelope?). It doesnt have to be a physical place. you could also safe it strongly encrypted (offline) somewhere in the internet (your gmail address) and write down the password you encrypted the private key with on paper and e.g. give it to a friend (he cant use it because he's got no access to your mail account).
but yea thats all considreations to be perfectly safe and make huge amounts of money safe.. if you stay in an area of a couple thousand dollars in bitcoin having them on your phone and on a paper at home would proably be appropriately safe
PS: i would actually prefer backing up a 12 word seed instead of a qr code because that qr code stands for 1 address but from the 12 word seed you can recover as many addresses as you want/used
@_date: 2015-04-07 14:02:13
well yea.. of course.
I'm looking for the most userfriendly service here
@_date: 2015-09-03 18:54:51
and then thats alright.. they would have made their mind about it and thought that the status quo is good..
taking a missing vote as status quo would just make it hard to get out of the status quo because of people that do not care and thereby always favouring the status quo.. why should we favour the status quo? (
@_date: 2015-09-03 12:50:20
Then you really missed a lot of what was going on recently.
Its basically one of the proposals of how bitcoin should be scaled in the near future to make it possible to handle more than 7 tx/sec. there are also some others like BIP100, BIP102, BIP103 (i guess) and so on. gavin actually proposed to set the block size to 20mb at the beginning of next year but then compromised to go to 8mb. so BIP 101 is 8mb which doubles every 2 years (in a continuos fashion) there are many developers that are fare more konservative.. some want to stay at 1 mb.. there's actually a big fight going on right now and in my opinion gavin has (in contrast to many other devs) always stayed reasonable, calm and diplomatic. and he wants for bitcoin what most others want.. bring it to the mainstream.. let it take over the world...
@_date: 2015-09-28 22:54:07
Finally i stumbled accross what you were refering to... it was SYMBOLIC.. don't be an asshole.. is america full of people like you?
@_date: 2015-09-26 16:57:48
ok ok, didn't want to be too negative. you're probably right.
@_date: 2015-04-29 20:02:43
what event is this?
@_date: 2015-09-20 10:55:39
so whats the 17.3% wallet!?
@_date: 2015-09-30 20:55:14
Cryptocurrencies are inherently wealth distributing. It's because they are currencies people can choose. If 99% of all bitcoins are held by just 10 people than society can say fuck bitcoin, lets use litecoin and these 10 people would own 99% of nothing.
Its different because we are not forced to use any specific crypto currency unlike we are forced to use euros or dollas depending on where we live.
@_date: 2015-09-14 17:36:29
Great part by Jeff Garzik!
At which time do they talk about Bitcoin-NG? I think its an awesome idea. It solves so many problems both sides of the debate bring up. Give these 10sec blocks another PoW (like e.g. the one ethereum uses with a memory intense DAG used) and there you go.. you have your nice decentralization properties again..
But sadly I think big, slow, unflexible bitcoin will not be able to adopt such a major change
@_date: 2015-04-07 15:02:40
he told me that he pays about 40$ for a 390$ money transfer.. something bitcoin-powered should be able to beat that..
thanks for the coinbase tip
@_date: 2015-09-03 14:38:45
well yep, he did. you must be either maxwells sockpuppet or extremely stu**d
@_date: 2015-09-20 01:16:15
haha sorry.. i find that somehow funny
@_date: 2015-09-20 22:18:04
they sell them in germany too.. i want one! ;)
@_date: 2015-09-21 18:36:30
well of course.. when they have the patent they can sue you for making use if it. in that case stating the patent is invalid would be a defense strategy (in the court case that is happening anyway)
@_date: 2015-09-20 01:28:26
attempting to destroy bitcoin by prohibiting healthy discussions is
@_date: 2015-09-17 12:06:48
ok fair enough.. i do not really have much evidence to support my claims..
so just think and imagine.. bitcoin is now mass adopted but centralized by just a few big miners. what would YOU do?
you are now able to use xyzerocash-whatevercoin, hold your money in it and pay with it. whoever only accepts bitcoin.. use your wallet that will pretty certain be able to convert your xyzerocash coins on the fly to bitcoin by using some decentralized exchange.
bitcoin is our trojan horse.. it doesnt really matter if exactly bitcoin will be our perfect currency in the future.. once any cruptocurrency got mainstream, we won..!
And this is kind of a worst case.. i honestly think bitcoin has very good chances to stay pretty decentralized.
Its about adoption now! Bring bitcoin to the people before banks finally inovate and make borderless (small and big) payments cheap and easy!
@_date: 2015-04-29 20:01:13
so what can we do?
@_date: 2015-09-26 13:44:02
we're not even all agreeing that this is the bitcoin symbol..
@_date: 2015-09-11 10:52:13
yes.. "just fork the code".. thats why i think OP is right that alternative solutions are needed.. not just previos versions
@_date: 2015-09-20 12:38:35
so i would pay for the damn shipping.. i want that drone! ^^
@_date: 2015-09-29 09:49:43
how was i generalizing, i wasn't stating something but asking.. 
and i think people in germany (at least in the west part) wouldn't massively pick on a boy that was clearly treated discustingly and not get upset when he receives &gt;symbolic&lt; gestures of compensation.. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 15:30:15
alright.. co-founder, not ceo..
still.. "Bandwidth is not what affects block propagation time." is a very general sentence and thereby a very powerful claim..!
Thats irritating people. What you mean is probably it does under the given conditions not really affect the block propagation time right now.

why do people get so upset about that? I'll never get americans

Some people tend to discard the obvious. Of course the obvious is not always correct. But the obvious is also not always not correct. 
Bitcoins users are bitcoins customers. Do we want a world in which cryptocurrencies are used by as many people as possible and thereby end governmental dictatorship and restrictions of our freedom? Then we should aim for average Joe being bitcoins customer. Of course average Joe is not bitcoins customer right now. But that's the whole point of the video. We should increase bitcoins utility and usability so that average Joe WILL be bitcoins customer.

and it will always be.. simply truths like people being not able to buy drugs or other "bad" stuff online with Gov or BankCoins will show them that bitcoin or other free crypto currencies are way more punk rock and exciting
edit: the only real thread in a GovCoin or BankCoin I see is in a by banks or goverments created their own access restricted and controlled blockchain.. but them using the bitcoin blockchain is actually them letting our trojan horse in.. but its not a big thread.. i don't think some bankcoin would really be attractive

as far as i remember after the patent was registered there is some time (i think it was 18 month) to protest that patent in written form (doesn't cost anything)..
and even after these 18 month have passed you can always go to court and when you can proove that the content of that patent was common knowledge at the time of registration it will get deleted. prooving something like that is fairly simple in the internet age.. also if they made some improvments from the common knowledge at that time but these improvements were trivial it is not a patent (keywords: Inventive step and non-obviousness)

What can the average bitcoin user do to contribute to bitcoins success? A list of things would be nice.
Some first entries:
- offer people at your location to buy/sell bitcoins from/to you
- get new people involved by giving bitcoin away as e.g. a birthday present (did it 2 times with big success)
- ... ?
@_date: 2015-09-21 17:47:21
yes that's the right thing to do.. don't get tired of asking.. at some point every business owner will have at least heared of it.
@_date: 2015-04-04 00:44:18
and how confirm that the payment was received? yea.. go to blockchain.info look it up there.. but its not that simple anymore see?
i think downloading an app (like mycelium) and writing down 12 words is actually very simple
@_date: 2016-10-27 18:53:25
There's not only this war there's also the war of innovation. 
Banks are more and more forced to innovate facing cryptocurrencies and have to remove friction to stay in the game. If we give them another couple of years they might succeed and by giving the average person a nice to use seemlessly working international currency then the average person will never adopt really free currencies like bitcoin. 
Also I think the war you describe would be won by bitcon even though it would require large servers to run. We don't have this one world government yet so competition among states will ensure that not all datacenters in the world can be shut down by anyone at the same time.

finally! i think this was a small step forward

well.. not that hard.. everybody actually just asked for a link
@_date: 2015-10-26 16:37:19
You didn't get the point of *discussing*.
It doesn't matter how many "experts" have an other opinion than him.. that doesn't mean he has to swith his opinion just because of that.

Ever heard of "agreeing to disaggree"?
If noone else shares his opinion it becomes irrelevant, if no other core devs share it it becomes less relevant. But let him be the voice of people who share his opinion - and there are a few..
If people support him with his ideas then he's not doing an ego thing but something important for those people.. if noone supports him than he's just alone with his opinion and will be no thread to the others with another opinion.. So where the *heck* is the problem here?
@_date: 2015-10-26 18:14:41

Most secure solution: Toss a coin 160 times, convert that offline to a private key. Write it down on 2 papers. put it into 2 safes at 2 different locations. You can also obfuscate the two written down keys in a way only you know.
@_date: 2016-05-18 14:54:13
well i googled and my impression was that its not a competitor but something that could more easily enable wide spread bitcoin payments..
@_date: 2015-02-16 22:53:26
well yea.. you're kind of right i guess

checked out the site.. nice.. exept: i have to sign in to vote for the video i just paid for? thats just stupid..
@_date: 2015-10-10 22:04:20
well.. actually the pure reddit mechanics are already pretty self moderating.. only puzzle piece missing is somehow preventing sybil attacks with mass account spamming.. could maybe be done by attaching a bitcoin pledge to give accounts the possibility to up/down vote in a certain sub reddit.. 
subreddits should be some kind of so there are many sub reddits and if someone invests many bitcoins to have thousnds of accounts just voting crap up in one sub reddit people could go to another one and the investment would be for nothing and lost
@_date: 2015-10-24 06:06:35
yea and it is because of the nature of bitcoins PoW not because of 1mb blocks..

actually, yes.. because there will be no specific person for the jury to judge
@_date: 2015-02-23 20:44:30
well not completely true..
probably most sidechains will be 1:1 exchanges but they dont have to.
the only requirement is that there is a &gt;deterministic&lt; way of exchanging them

I think it's hard to argue against that bitcoin is the  crypto currency because of its first mover advantage.. People think that scarcity is an important property and we should thereby agree on 1-2 coins and I'm one of them. 
But still.. I think bitcoin is less fragile than you might expect.. its still not too late to screw up and learn from it.. We should use our early phase to get as diverse as possible.. especially in how we view the process of developing Bitcoin. What we have right now, 1 group of core developers and 1 client 95% all players have installed and 1 small circle of people making decicions is not just a social, and political.. its mainly a computer security desaster! 
The hole ecosystem running the same software means 1 security hole to screw up the hole network.. There is no other known weapon against security holes than having some software diversity.
The real thread for bitcoin is not a hard fork but a hack.. This would ultimativly screw up people's trust, especially when bitcoin got big at that time
@_date: 2015-02-01 12:47:39
so maybe team up with them
@_date: 2015-02-05 11:43:18
the time will come when some administrator of some coinbase like site will just say "fuck it", takes all the bitcoins and goes out of the country.. this is much easier with bitcoins than with money.. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 17:15:08
guys.. you have my attention.. looks like a nice piece of software.. 1000 bits
@_date: 2015-02-06 15:09:33

@_date: 2015-02-14 14:43:55
thx 1000 bits
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:19:12
and then have more than one wallet.. you should have at least a reeally save one for big amounts where you almost never enter the passwort to send money out of it (to be robust against keyloggers for the case your pc gets compromised) then a middle secure one and a fun one with just tiny amounts of bitcoins
@_date: 2015-02-15 12:43:31
what about bitcoin.org? they compare different wallets..: 
well send me an url and let me compare it :)
@_date: 2015-02-06 23:44:18


so then the fed would have to make several legid drug selling transactions to establish trust in the system. An effort which is usually not made to bust a consumer customer. To catch a seller they could would have to corrupt the whole tor network (what by the way did not happen for the silkroad case).
There wont be any real "big players" as noone is needet for a role as ulbrich had by providing a plattform.
@_date: 2015-10-26 18:50:02
Yes.. that's what I'm saying. In the end because of that little thing called network effect we'll have 1-2 versions with the most support. 
What're you afraid of? Longer lasting volatility? At least no group will be in charge in such a scenario and the 'winning' version would be determined not by its name but by what it stands for..!

@_date: 2015-02-11 12:28:02
for electrum walled for example all you need are 12 words.. no other data. you can calculate your wallet and all you're addresses from these 12 words.
So write them down and put them somewhere where you're children would have access. (e.g. a safe in your house or in a bank in an envelope)

Don't get me wrong.. it's good to already think about all of this. But to be honest.. i think when it is really needed a hard fork with a block size increase will be implemented very fast

@_date: 2015-02-05 11:42:08
Nice, its win win. you make some money and help bitcoin develop at the same time by spreading the word. Please tell people not to use online coine stores like coinbase but to set up their own wallets. Like andreas antonopoulos said: "not your wallet, not your bitcoins"
@_date: 2015-02-06 20:17:26
see what i already wrote:




the difference to the silkroad case will be that ulbricht could clearly be considered as a central actor and organisator of the whole thing and therefor made responsible for all the drug trading.
on the other hand at openbazaar they can just see that you're using a peer to peer connection (which is encrypted).
the problem with silkroad was that servers still had to be central machines with people responsible for it.. this is what openbazaar changes
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:17:18
go to 
they have a nice wallet overview there. I think electrum is a nice wallet (electrum.org). it reduces the risk of making false backups by having some addresses not included in the backup by being deterministic. all you have to backup is 12 words..!
@_date: 2016-07-18 12:32:44
Well it's not stupid to be a bitcoin maximalist.. I also was one. It is weakening one of the most important properties a currency should have namely the scarcity of the supply to have an endless amount of new cryptocurrencies used every year.
But I changed my mind. Allowing/hoping only one cryptocurrency, bitcoin, to be used assumes an ideal world where the sufficient decentralization of that one cryptocurrency is and will always be ensured. I feel that this is not guaranteed and so I think it is better to have 2 or 3 major cryptocurrencies and thereby add a new additional layer of decentralization and competition.
