I informed them of this before I made any payments and they were ok with this. Obviously like in most scam companies, things change when you hand over the money. Also I have email proof of this but it contains personal information that is more delicate to share. I also have a contract with a US production company which I offer to show but as I told you, they said It was ok before any money.

Thank you for your help. English is not my first language and sometimes I have some grammar issues.

I am working on a 3 month video project in Colombia. But I live in the US, pay taxes, have my accounts, even have the shitty obama care and gave them all my residential proof, including phone bill.

I am very new to bitcoin and still learning but I already had several experiences good and bad I would like to share. 
One of my first experience and with no idea how to purchase or where, I found this website called Circle.com. I saw how easy it was to acquire Bitcoins there so I decided to purchase $100 usd. The purchase experience was ok, a little long but I guess since I was a first time user. I finally received my bitcoins on the 4th business day and got on email telling me to please cash them out.
I was a little confused since I just recently purchased them. On the whole Idea that I wanted to have my first Bitcoins, not to lose money stupidly by doing what they we're obligated me to do.
I wrote to them and received information that they wanted to verify my account. 
To me this is becoming suspicious! They sell bitcoins but they also make you unwilling sell your bitcoins. I guess they can be called the first Bitcoin Dictatorship!
Since I am completely against this I decided to just leave my bitcoins and wait a little so I can get my money's worth back and leave far far away from this company. At the moment I was loosing 11% already do to bitcoin devaluation.
After a couple of days I received and email saying my account has been closed, and go wonder..... I can't obtain my bitcoins.
Please be aware of this company and there narcissism! Do not let your money get stolen here.
I will be posting email proof and spreading word on other media.

Thats my hole point! They wanted me to sell immediately but I wanted to keep my bitcoins. Check out the emails on the images. After I said I wanted to keep my bitcoins they stop contact and some days after they closed my account with no prior notice.
