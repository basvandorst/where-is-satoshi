Love YTcracker. I listen to him all the time. He has a TON of awesome "nerdcore rap" stuff like this. With lyrics like "I hit the volcano once then I move through a series of tubes just like I was captain draino" I just can't get enough. Here's more!

I just thought it was a shit article trying to capitalize on the "mt. gox down, bitcoin bad" tend going on in the niche lately. It's trying to bash bitcoin and the value of it based on a non-functioning exchange. I agree with Harbinger's summary of the article.

Oh hell yeah, sign me up as a publisher. Payments every week? Fantastic. Soooo much better than getting paid once a month, the month after you've earned it. If you want to really rake in the publishers pay them as the cpm (and hopefully cpc soon) gets verified. i.e. if I hit the cpm target and it gets verified I immediately get paid. I would love you forever..
btw, I'll be testing this out on my crypto site. This is a fantastic way to get relevant ads. Adsense is shit at relevant ads in the crypto space. Advertisers, please load him up with your ads so I can push them!
As a full time web-marketeer making laughable amounts from adsense.. Thank you for this. Seriously.. you're my new best friend.
Edit* Once you've collected some data, do your publishers a favor and tell us which ad sizes are the most popular and receive the most revenue / ads from advertisers. You've got a large listing of ad sizes and since you're new it's safe to assume most may not have image banners yet. (Text ads don't perform very well). It would help a lot. Also on that note I'd love it if I could choose to only display text ads if no image banners are available. Having worked with advertising networks for years I could give you advice all day on this project. Let me know if you want more feedback I'll be happy to help!

Makes sense, that backs up my feeling on it a bit too. Bitcoin = HODL, Altcoin = Quick &amp; High Risk High Reward
Thanks for your input, it's appreciated :)

People in second life pay in Linden. I would think it would be extremely hard to get any customers to pay you in BTC, let alone the majority of them. Especially when it was so little known.


Why would this matter when you're the one getting paid? It costs real money to obtain LL just like it does BTC.
I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm just genuinely curious how you were able to rip BTC out of a game where it's not really heard of. I'd love to be able to pull out BTC over LL.
Can you post any of your builds? Maybe marketplace links? I genuinely want to see them. I made a good bit of money in SL with free commission based financial scripts. In my time there I became a fan of high quality builds. Everything in that game is so shit tier that anything half decent was a serious breath of fresh air, especially quality avatars. I'd love to see your work. PM me if you'd rather keep it private. :)
@_date: 2014-11-13 23:51:18
Did you convert linden to btc, or get paid in BTC? I have a hard time believing you could fine a lot of BTC buyers back when it would make sense to be earning that many btc. Can you post some pictures / SLURL's of your work?
@_date: 2014-02-22 18:44:43

I keep seeing posts saying that Mt. Gox is dead. While they may be very close to it, we need to remember the cease in trading is supposedly "temporary". They could spring back to bite us again, or whatever, i'm not a fortune teller.

It's basically a hub where you can browse what all the big pump n dump accounts are saying. There's no kind of early detection. I'll be trying to re-tweet active pumps but I can't promise I'll catch them all. Basically made so you can scroll through all the feeds on one page from largest to smallest following, and by looking at the time stamps of the most recent tweets see what's currently happening.

Nice rig, are you just holding them all or selling some to cover expenses?

tldr; China is causing discount Bitcoin prices, if I'm not mistaken. Or something, I'm probably wrong.
@_date: 2014-05-13 17:50:44
Excellent advice, thanks for the tips! Do you feel this is the same for altcoins though? It seems like the buy and hold strategy doesn't work nearly as often there because coins often die. Do you have any more tips specifically for altcoin? Would love to hear more of an experienced opinion on the matter.
@_date: 2014-03-06 04:37:27
Brilliant, thanks!

Hey man web developers need to eat too. If you don't want to support their hours upon hours worth of development and content creation all meant to satisfy your eyeballs that's what adblock is for.. Though the second you turn that puppy on you're taking food off the owners plate of the websites you oh so love to browse. (Kind people white list sites they enjoy!)
"Isn't bitcoin all about subverting the establishment?" "Literally contribute nothing to society" geez man.. you couldn't be more wrong..

Thanks for the feedback! I've got an embarrassingly small wallet to trade with, but currently I'm holding from pretty low. The downtrend the past couple days was brutal but cinni has taken the  volume spot on mintpal and appears to be rising again. Last time this happened we went from ~12k to ~38k. The downtrend seemed forced by a lot of traders I talked to, which makes me think the whales finally got their full. Price appears to be rising this morning.
Please make your own opinions though.. I prefer not to give straightforward trading advice because some people will follow anything and come back mad if they take a loss..
Here's a better chart, it's lacking long term history but it's so nice on the eyes :D
@_date: 2014-02-17 03:38:10
Bit of a personal question but I'll put it to you this way. If you have any sort of paying job I likely have less in bitcoin than you make in a couple days max. I'm a supporter of it, not an investor. I also specialize in niche marketing and can read the intention of the post like a book.. The primary goal's not to educate people on bitcoin, it's to drive traffic from a popular trend.
@_date: 2014-03-01 16:50:27
Probably the best bitcoin talk I've seen yet. Very informative.
@_date: 2014-05-13 17:38:37
Yeah altcoins are definitely easier to manipulate. There's always a bigger whale though..
@_date: 2014-01-27 00:26:06
Seems fair, makes sense. Go Coinbase!
@_date: 2014-05-13 17:45:18
I'm just trying to give people informative information, and an in to the good trading advice I've been getting in IRC. IRC is the only place I've gotten solid tips, and if the website is to succeed I need to give actual advice..
But skepticism is good in the world of crypto, so good job looking for all angles I suppose :)
Also.. I don't follow what you mean by "[shrill]( bank".... Sounds like something would draw haha.
@_date: 2014-05-13 17:32:40
Personally I think it's relevant for all crypto.. look how many times "China has banned bitcoin!".

It's just market manipulation that favors the holders. You are correct.

So it's a decentralized exchange reliant on centralized services and it doesn't work in the US where Bitcoin is the most popular.
Seems legit.
