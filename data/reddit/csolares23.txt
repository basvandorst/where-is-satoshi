Will do. I have something in mind so that you could see the different exchange rates at a glance!

Yeah you're right, at the moment it gets it from btc-e. Definitely not what I want in the future but it was a starting point. In the near future I want to get from the top exchanges and have more data to show people. That is first priority before I get the Android version out.

Well it was orginally oging to be "CoinWatchDog" but the name was too long on iOS devices. But I plan on building out the API so that I can use it to display just as much information on coinwatchdog.com (domain that I own).

That's a really good idea. And then I was thinking in the detailed view to have all of them separate.

Yeah [CSolares23]( I don't have this code there but I have a couple other small things.
@_date: 2013-06-20 20:55:54
What exchange sites would you personally like on it?
@_date: 2013-07-09 18:43:39
It's currently in review for iOS App Store, and sometime this week will be submitted into Google Play

Android is coming along slowly but it is; I'm thinking I'll have it out on Android in a month or so. I need to first get the API that gathers all the information more refined (and from different sources) before I get Android out.

Would having a simple Android app very similar to the current iOS app be more important then making the current app better overall?
@_date: 2013-06-21 13:25:34
Definitely what everyone is asking me and I will. :)
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:47:19
Well that's because it's brand spanking new, I just released it on Droid.
If you want to see the iOS app check it out:

Also redesigned by a fellow Redditor :)
@_date: 2013-06-20 20:14:48
All suggestions are welcome FYI, I definitely will develop it if it's something people want!
@_date: 2013-06-20 20:13:53
Yeah at the moment it get all it's info from btc-e and I plan on getting market information from the main currency markets soon (mtgox, etc). Alerts are definitely something I want to add too.

Thank you everyone for making this small little app into hopefully so much more. I've been getting a lot of great suggestions and I working on them! Let me know if anyone knows any knows any DBAs or API guru's. It's not my forte, but that doesn't mean I won't be hashing it out (no pun intended)!
@_date: 2013-06-20 20:59:14
That's really cool! I like the news aggregator a lot.
@_date: 2013-07-09 18:42:56
I just want to let everyone know, I've been working on this! I don't have the server ability to do push notifications BUT I did implement RSS feeds, and way more coins from WAY more exchanges
