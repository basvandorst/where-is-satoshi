No, it doesn't give you ownership of it forever.  No one lives forever.  There are criteria which common law has taken hundreds of years to work out with regards to how much work, how much physical presence, and how much time you own something you homestead, before it reverts back to a state of nature and becomes unowned again.   The actual ownership of "land" is a strange concept... its more that you own the right to use the resources within an *area*.
This is not a flaw in libertarian thought, its a strength.  In modern statist society, you do not own your land either... your government claims ownership of it.  This is provable in that as soon as you stop paying taxes on it, your privileges to that land are revoked.  Is this the world you think is better than libertarian philosophy?  Where does the state base its claim on the land within the borders that it has defined?  Certainly not on any moral grounds, because its claim is based on force (keeping the land from other states and also away from its own citizens).


No, your labor is traded for whatever payment you've worked out. You own your body, your labor, and can trade it for any goods that someone else agrees to give you.

A lot of things have been proposed, but I've been down that road discussing this before.  If you require an expansive, complete description of how a truly free society would handle these things before deciding whether its a good idea to go that route, then you'll be disappointed. No one has all the answers, that's why government fails at central planning.  You can rest assured though that -some- solutions will be there... crimes you describe are universally abhorrent, and so will be universally solved... but the details aren't something that be rationally discussed.  If I, for example, give you a solution, and you see a flaw in it, you may dismiss the premise of the main problem of state coercion entirely.
I'd rather discuss any questions you have about seeing the present state is an immoral construct.  Only when and if you can see the force and coercion the present system is built upon, then you can start looking for how the world will (and in many ways already does) handle disputes *sans* government.

The Khmer Rouge in Cambodia thought like you do.  They literally put everyone out on the same field (except the leaders of course)... emptying the cities and putting everyone to work in those fields in an attempt to make everyone equal.  That wasn't good enough though. You see, a lot of the city-dwellers had no clue how to work manual labor and had a rough time bringing in the high quota that were set.  Intellectuals argued this all was impossible, and after all, someone who was an intellectual was certainly not equal to the average uneducated peasant. And so they were put to death.  All told, 2 million people of a population of 5 million died from brutal murder or as a result of the inevitable famine that resulted.
You see, the only way to make any two people more equal is to cripple (or you know, kill) the one with ability.  So yes, I do see the inherent flaw in trying to make people equal.

Only individuals exists, they are overwhelmingly good or but sometimes bad.  Government is a concept, and so cannot be well-intentioned or ill-intentioned.   Bad people will always seek more power, which is what makes government frightening, since bad people will flood into government and turn it to thier own self-interest.   Any good that government does is because those bad people need to convince you that they are going to use the power for good.  Until, they no longer do. Its an inevitable course towards destruction.

Fiat inflation is the creation of additional base units of currency (ie more dollars created) which then reduces the buying power of each unit.
In the case of Bitcoin, the base unit of currency is always the lowest non-subdividable unit, because that is the lowest practical limit allowable by virtue of the transaction cost mechanism. Subdividing Bitcoin by one decimal place would create 10 times additional base units, meaning in essence there is ten times more currency out there. This inflation would cause buying value to be reduced of each unit to be reduced over time, something that no one that holds a lot of BTC would ever want to happen.

Yes, if someone owns a resource or product, they have moral claim on it and potentially anything derived from it, in whole or in part.  But there are also *unowned* resources out there available to be homesteaded by whoever can use them to a productive end.  Homesteading is an act where your body (physical labor) mixes with unowned resources, resulting something new that no one else can stake a moral claim on.

Are there any laws that exist today that you morally disagree with?
If I broke that law, would you support the government charging me with that crime?
Would you support them coming to my home and arresting me?
Would you support their decision to use force to prevent me from escaping or resisting that arrest?
Would you support them using deadly force if I defend myself from that arrest?
Do you remember that I asked you to name a crime you disagree with?  Do you realize that you support me being put to death for breaking a law that you personally think should not be a crime?
Are you moral for believing that I should be put to death for breaking a law that you agree should not exist?

I oppose the use of coercive force at all levels, great and small.  You won't convince me that subscribing to the belief in a great big forceful entity known as "government" (even one put in power by the equally imaginary "democratic will of the people") is the solution to all the small localized forceful situations.  You also won't convince me that those localized forceful situations that will pop up after government is gone are reasonable either.  No one can "do whatever the hell they want" in a stateless society, they must still adhere to the non-aggression principle, or the victims and their defenders are perfectly justified in doing whatever it takes to end that force.

There will never be consensus to subdivide further.  While there is a limit of 21 million full bitcoins, the *real* limit is the number of satoshi because it cannot be currently subdivided any lower than that. Doing so, let's say adding just one more decimal place is exactly the same as inflating the money supply by 10 times, and thereby reducing the buying power of it by 1/10th.
While it is technically possible to subdivide, there will never be consensus in the future to do so exactly because people will realize that their money will lose so much buying power. If a subdivide is ever going to happen, it has to happen before all the 21 million full coins are generated.

A libertarian is someone who simply believes that *you own your life*. You own your body (because no one else can morally claim to).  You own the productive results of *using* your body (you own anything you create and earn, because no one else can morally claim to).  Libertarians recognize that force and coercion are immoral infringements on your self-ownership, which leads to the principle of non-aggression (no one may *initiate* the use of force or coercion against another).
We all understand this on a basic level. The lessons of early childhood reflect this ("Don't hit. Don't steal. Don't lie."), but over time those simple, easily-grasped lessons get tainted by the desire of other people to break those rules to own some portion of your life... government being the worst expression of this.

If your childhood was forced, I do sympathize, as mine was often also.  But it doesn't *need* to be forced - we just had bad parents.

Your definition of violence is skewed.  In no way am I committing violence against anyone by breaking a law just by virtue of it being on the books.  Violence is an action between two people... I simply cannot be violent when no one else is involved.
Its understandable that you would try to turn my peaceful actions into something you can call "violence" because if you accept the truth that they are not violent, then you have to realize that you are resorting to a violent solution to a non-violent act.

What you do in your time, with your own body, with your own resources, is completely your decision... even if the majority thinks its a bad idea.
For this to be a *rational* discussion, then there cannot be a gun on the table. You support the state, you support your taxes going to fund the police, and you support their decision to arrest me if I were doing something that merely goes against what some majority thinks, yet harms none of them.

No it assumes the vast majority (not "everyone") make rational decisions, that everyone can claim only the resources they can directly homestead to assert ownership on, and that the vast majority is nice, cooperative, and compromising. I think that's true.
What government does is give that small percentage of overtly greedy, manipulative, and power-hungry an avenue to take advantage of a great many people in order to get what they desire.
I understand how foreign the idea is that people are generally good, but you've got to keep in mind that you've been evangelized your whole life by people that kneel at the altar of statism.  Your teachers, your "news" sources, your entertainment, most philosophers... all these sources of information for you have an amazingly powerful investment in the continued existence of government.  They all draw special privileges from the consolidation of coercive force represented in the government, and so of course they will continue to find ways of presenting the institution as "absolutely necessary".
Before the scientific revolution, churches did the same thing.  Now, that power is waning... and someday there will be a cultural revolution.  Just as we've seen nature acts predictably by simple natural laws, not gods... people will see that society is ordered by simple moral laws, not government.
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:36:22


Yes, and the only fair way to decide is to let the person who first makes a homestead claim try there hand as using the resources in that area.  They will either do well (and continue to use those resources to provide things that the market desires), or they will fail (and will give up their rights the resources they homesteaded so that someone else can).

In the "real world", new money creation is often funneled to those that are already rich, who have the benefit of spending that money at present value before it circulates and causes prices to rise.  In the Bitcoin realm, this is the same as the stock split, so, while current holders see no immediate difference, the miners would potentially start earning less and less per transaction, since now their fees can be reduced toward the new lower limit. As a result, the miners, who are the ones that need to adhere to consensus on a split, would avoid it.

The federal government doesn't have "funds" itself. There are only 3 ways a government can get that money, all immoral:
* Tax it - money is gotten from peaceful individuals by ever-increasing threats of violence.
* Print it - more currency is infused into the economy, which reduces the value of the pre-existing currency.
* Borrow it - government borrows the money, leaving a debt which must be repaid by future, unborn generations (the grossest example of taxation without representation).
Bitcoin is beautiful because it doesn't inherently support any of these, once all the coins are mined.

By its very nature, Bitcoin early on has only attracting investors that lack trust in strength of real world money.  Lately though, the newer investors don't really care about long-term prospects, but instead see its sudden growth and are jumping on the bandwagon for quick profits.   These are people that aren't really serious about staying in Bitcoins, nor adding to the actual market (such as selling services or trading bitcoins for products).   This current uptick is far more a result of those investors than any of the previous surges, and the minute they sense that its hit a peak, they are going to bail out - a lot - and get back into their normal real world investments.   Watch for it to hit 25, briefly to 30, then crash  - this pattern is what happened in June 2011, and its what people are looking at now.

That's a bit inaccurate.  Its not really possible for him to sell all those coins for the current going price.

It may become that, in time, which is the idea fueling the speculation right now. But its better to think of bitcoin as buying raw silver which may one day become silver coins in circulation as a currency.  Of course, there is no guarantee it will be used like that.

Since they can't withdraw the USD that fast, they convert to the max they *can* withdraw, and let the market keep going up.

Without all those early *real* transactions, bitcoin would not be in the place it is now, and it's people like you that began the process of showing that this can be a viable currency.  You are still very much an "early adopter" just by knowing about it today, so its never too late to be involved!

OK, reading this officially started to turn my stomach. Its the same sales pitch as *every* Ponzi scheme ever.  Bitcoin was a good idea for a currency, its a terrible idea as a commodity that relies on ever-increasing monetary inputs from more and more new people putting in more and more money.
If people reading this are more concerned about getting new money into the system in order to pump up the value of *your* investment, then you are part of the scheme.  I'm starting to see this too much now, and I'm gonna drop out.

It goes to those that cash out first.   I'm guessing the big holders are mostly waiting to see who flinches first by making a big grab.   The first ones out will score the most.
Of course, the exchanges have daily/monthly withdrawal limits that could limit this.

The honest truth is that even if I explained what I watch for, you should not trust any advice given here.  There are 20,000 readers of this reddit all looking to do the exact same thing as you.
* Some will tell the truth and know what they are talking about.
* Some will lie to get you to play into their position.
* Most have no clue and are just guessing or wishful thinking.

Any pullback is simply limited to the rate at which the big holders can withdraw USD from the exchanges.  Right now, slightly more speculative money is coming in than going out. Once it peaks though it'll go down only about as fast as it went up, probably won't be sudden (since sellers wouldn't want to shake the speculators out too soon).

This.  Does anyone really believe the bankers will let themselves be caught behind the curve on a new currency?  Hell no.  Very likely, they will prepare their own version of bitcoin and position their fortunes in it before introducing it to the world.  The power elite will all adopt it because they know what's good for them.  And then we little people will be invited.
