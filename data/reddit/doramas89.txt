Im not trying anything, you are trying to keep a closed mind. End the topic here.
I recommend to you and to everyone not just to buy what you hear around, but to look for information and think for yourself

That coin swallows 8mb blocks with no problem. Our Bitcoin has stuck transactions and has trouble processing 1mb blocks. What you said makes no sense
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:06:50
Paying half of Bangladesh's monthly income for a transaction that can be stuck three days is indeed promising for the currency

If it is adopted glovally, every business, every merchant will be a node. Not every smartphone needs to be a node, if there are 10 million nodes in the world that is enough, there is your decentralization. You are falsely asuming only 4 mining companies will do the mining.
Core solutions are centralization. But im off, no point arguing with who is stubborn

Another answer totally unrelated. Focus on the point, please. Analize what he says, not his eating or drug habits. I don't care if he has sex with goats or does drugs - the fact that here are tens of people banned here every day speaks much about core's decentralization x)

Do not be mistaken, that's exactly what bch is intending to do and for a good reason. It's intending to recover the name that the kidnappers inherited on August 1, who now control mainstream opinion and are looking to implement second layer, centralized solutions that will end up with users paying in order to move their money through offchain, KYC/AML regulated parties.
Do not be mistaken.

It would be stupid to assume we (me, and you) know more than him

I agree. This video is not investment advice, it's an explanation of the situation. I'm not bullish on anything
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:12:02
Ok, let's be quiet and not raise our concerns against possible fraud.
Error 404

Can you guys explain me why the hate? Im posting an article I didnt write. I'm not propaganding anyone to use one coin or another. I'm opening a discussion that can affect bitcoin. Why can't we talk?
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:53:58
Well, some of us have the opinion that btc has parted ways from the original goal of bitcoin since its inception, and that is a fact. The website is no longer advertising it as an electronic cash system with low fees and fast speed. People who didnt agree with the current direction forked away, while those who really parted ways from satoshi's goal for bitcoin have retained the name. Downvote me to hell, i posted the video in the hopes that some would open their mind slightly and think for themselves about the direction blockstream (with bankers behind) is taking Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:09:51
Sorry but you dont know what bitcoin is, only what they have implanted in your mind that you now eco. Read the whitepaper
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:49:44
Then you have no fucing idea of the point of bitcoin in the first place.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:20:28
Escrow? loans? managed by something OFF the blockchain (decentralization protocol)
I'm out of here. I can only wish you luck in the times to come
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:48:09
and you agree with this forum banning objective criticism? that's an evolution of bitcoin.org , facts ; narrative changed because it can no longer be used as a p2p electronic cash system due to high fees and confirmation times - publicly and admitely imposed by the only company in charge of btc's development.
Yes, I will be banned. Or post will get shadowremoved, as allways
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:57:30
When Bitcoin goes global, every other decent-size business will be running a node because they want to GET PAID. With tens of thousands of nodes in the world, I say that's truly decentralization. 
When was the last time tens of thousands plotted together a maneuver? Never.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:10:58
Legit argument, we can close the thread now
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:14:46
As a business owner you would be charged $0.03 for moving $15k if you didn't use this particular one
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:58:38
Curious about the downvotes. It's an explanation for you to draw your own conclusions, you don't need to agree with the guy's investment practices.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:44:07
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:34:54
You dont even get the point of a peer to peer decebtralized electronic cash system.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:12:26
Off-chain second layer solutions are trustless. The blockchain protocol is what allows not to trust an intermediary, if you move outside of it you ARE using a PayPal 2.0
Please provide arguments to your point because it is made up.
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:23:26
LTC is a copy of BCH. Those solutions already exist in the non segwit bitcoin, open the image. You may find uncensored discussion of everything bitcoin related in r/btc . The proof is I will be banned from tjis subforum and this thread will be deleted soon 
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:10:15
The video focuses on one, but the points are legit. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:40:13
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:46:37
he's talking about the banning of users and topics here. You cannot discuss the future of bitcoin in this forum, period. Go ahead and try to post something other than fanboyism to core
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:54:55
I have a question for you: what makes bitcoin so magical that you don't want it to happen?
Segwit's Bitcoin proposes off chain solutions. Solutions OFF the blockchain lose the decentralization aspect, which is the goal of a digital global currency in the first place.
Why defend the indefendible? Do some research, dont accept opinions spoon fed to you by others.
