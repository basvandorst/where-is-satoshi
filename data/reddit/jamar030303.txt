And what's so absurd about it? What makes it so different from me opening, say, a savings account at a small Chinese bank with no business presence in the US (which I've done twice already)?

Question: If a credit card doesn't verify instantly, how long does it normally take? I just signed up, tried adding two of my cards, and neither worked instantly. I was hoping it would be like QuickBT- verify phone number, checkout, and done.

Unless, of course, you're non-resident. Then all bets are off. This is the case for me- if TD and BMO weren't OK with accepting my proof of student status from the States I'd have to pay to maintain a Canadian chequing account. The funny thing is, the bank I have a credit card with from China has a full-service banking operation in Canada as well and they're perfectly fine with giving me a free *savings* account with unlimited transactions. They just won't give me a chequing account, and when asked they said something about "Canadians only".

Yep, pity it took so long to start becoming a thing here. Six years on it still hasn't gotten old for me, the "omg this is cool" feeling that comes from arriving at the airport, skipping the lines at the "international" ATMs and train ticket counter backed up with tourists, and just tapping in with my phone.

How much could it possibly cost? In China my cousin sent me money by domestic bank transfer and it took 3 hours and cost about 20p (using a rough 10CNY:1GBP conversion rate).
@_date: 2014-11-06 03:40:04
The problem being that once the money's signed away to the merchant, that's it. With a CC I have a good long while to dispute any transaction that goes pear-shaped. 
Example: on TripAdvisor there's multiple complaints of certain online travel agents asking the airline to refund them the money for the customer's plane ticket in the middle of their trip for no apparent reason, leaving the traveler stranded when attempting to return. Attempts to ask the TA to pass the refund back to them have not been successful. 
Say this traveler paid in BTC. If the buyer and seller sign the BTC away at the time the ticket was issued, there's no recourse in such a scenario. Even waiting until the outbound is flown could mean waiting months for the TA to get their money from the customer when the airline wants it from them right when the ticket is issued. Waiting until the return is successfully flown to release funds would be unacceptably long for any travel agent, even the reputable ones. 
@_date: 2014-10-26 17:09:46
With no recourse? Not childish at all.

Might take a while since those are issued from Japan and Apple is only working with US issuers right now. Won't be long, though, contactless payment has been a thing in Japan for far longer and they'll be eager to get in on the action.

Chinese ATMs do. Type in the other person's debit card number, type in the amount to send, confirm the name matches, and poof, it's done.
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:58:28
And for me it's even worse since I don't even have a verified account to show for it anymore. How long has it been since they said they'd work on allowing Americans to trade again?

Usually the types of jurisdictions that accept non-residents impose limits.  For example, a Japanese non-resident bank account won't so much as even let you have a debit card, or send/receive electronic transfers. Hong Kong is more reasonable, though there are still certain things you can't get without being resident (Citi imposes a minimum balance requirement on non-residents, though other banks impose it on *everyone*). Taiwan is hit or miss- a simple paper application to the local immigration office lets anyone there legally (even tourists) get an ID number to apply for such things, but banks may or may not accept it. 
Estonia looks different, as it seems that most banks over there don't seem to charge all that much in the way of fees, nor do they seem to require a minimum balance. Better than the usual jurisdictions that let non-residents open bank accounts without setting foot on their shores. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 21:15:58
On the other hand, we in the States don't have anything like QuickBT- instant debit purchase of BTC.

No, because I don't work in Canada. If there's a way to get a temporary SIN as someone coming and going on a visitor visa waiver/NEXUS card I'd love to hear it, because Tangerine sounds awesome.
Two reasons I have a Canadian bank account:
* I need to be able to send and receive e-transfers every now and then. My sister's studying in Canada, she's an authorized user on some of my credit cards (my American ones, not my Chinese one because UnionPay merchant acceptance is just this side of nonexistent in Canada) and that's how she pays me for what she uses (she gets the occasional funny look or extra scrutiny because they're Chip+Sign, not Chip+PIN, but that's a story for another day). 
As for why she needs multiple credit cards? Partly to earn extra points, partly for things like purchase protection and travel benefits. Baggage delay/loss compensation is a must when flying AC. 
* This one won't be helped by Tangerine so much. Having an actual Chip+PIN Visa (debit) card saved me quite a bit of headache in Europe this summer. Saved us waiting for a staffed ticket counter when getting tickets for quite a few tourist attractions in Paris, for instance (line for staffed ticket counter at Versailles- I lost count at 150 people with three cashiers, line for machines- none with 12 machines open, but they only took Chip+PIN cards. My American Chip+Sign card wouldn't authorize and the bank said they saw nothing), and my American Chip+Sign card crashed some self-checkouts in the UK.
The first one will only be an issue for as long as my sister lives in Canada, the second will be an issue until American banks get their heads out of their behinds and start issuing actual Chip+PIN cards. Schwab issued me a chipped debit card already- and it's Chip+Sign. If I lose it and someone picks it up, they can still go to town on it.

Well, it's a way to buy BTC online without having to sign up for something is what I'm getting at.

@_date: 2014-10-27 07:32:36
Except when it doesn't. For example, it looks like I have to pay about 20% extra to top up my Chinese number.
@_date: 2014-10-02 09:04:47
Nope, Mainland China is similar (none of the domestically-held banks charge you for a basic account- sign up under the wrong terms and you might end up paying like US$1.50/year for your debit card, but that's it), and they're a big chunk of the world. 
Odd thing, though- when I was living in Shanghai I watched as every credit union in the city combined into a bank, which was then partially purchased by ANZ. Still have no idea why it happened but it's not like there was any shortage of financial institutions.
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:51:07
There are limitations, however. For example, I'm an American who visits Canada often due to family. BMO happily gave me a student account and SPC with just my American passport and student card. None of the other banks even considered giving me a student account and quite a few wouldn't even consider giving me an account at all (ING Direct in Canada straight-up told me "no SIN, no account" and ICBK said "no residency, no checking account"- granted, ICBK's savings account works just fine for most purposes, but not for preauthorized debit). 
@_date: 2014-02-20 11:10:17
This entirely depends on your banking situation. For example, one of the banks I use (Schwab) has a list of receiving accounts specifically for foreign currencies and foreign wires. I can receive CAD, AUD, Euro, GBP, HKD, and a couple of other currencies. I provide the sender with Schwab's receiving account in the relevant country (their Euro receiving account is based in Germany), they send the money with "for further credit to: (my name) (my account number)" in the memo line, and it hits my US-based account in hours with an exchange rate not too far from mid-market. The downside is it's only good for receiving; all outbound transfers originate in the US.

My point is, if there's only been one new retail banking license issued in the last 150 years, and it wasn't Icesave, how were they operating in the UK and what prevents others from doing the same? Hopefully without collapsing.
@_date: 2014-04-10 21:06:08
Well, any foreigner working in the US would have a SSN, so they're only really excluding non-residents and exchange students. That and BBVA being the multi-national they are, hopefully they introduce Simple elsewhere soon
@_date: 2014-04-19 16:46:30
Chinese debit cards are not like American ones. In person, it's no PIN, no transaction. Online purchases require your online banking login and either a one-time code generated on a physical device, a one-time code sent to your phone, or a USB security dongle connected to your computer while the transaction is performed. For smaller transactions it's sometimes possible to do it with just card number and PIN, but never can you do any sort of debit transaction with information shown on the card alone.
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:44:05
Yeah, that's what they ended up doing- they needed my SSN during the opening process. Makes sense if you put it that way- every account in Canada I have in conjunction with a relationship with a subsidiary or head office elsewhere (ICBK used my credit card I had with them in China to identify/check me instead of asking for an SSN, and granted, if I didn't need pre-authorized debit/direct deposit I'd just use their free savings account with unlimited transactions and call it a day). 
In which case it seems like direct banks in Canada are a lot like those in the US- Capital One 360 (our former ING Direct already changed its name) requires a SSN to open an account, which kept me from recommending them to my exchange student friends, even though the $150 cash bonus they offered for new accounts on Black Friday (and $50 referral bonus for me) would've been nice to have, and my sister up in Vancouver still needs her Canadian roommate to co-sign for a lot of things.
@_date: 2014-03-24 04:26:59


Except people keep repeating over and over that an exchange isn't a bank, so that doesn't quite make an analogy.
@_date: 2014-03-22 15:39:22
Well, they don't do debit cards as of yet is the reason I didn't.
@_date: 2014-07-29 19:22:03
And are these going to be limited to Canadians only like your exchange?
@_date: 2014-02-08 03:22:49
Share price is one thing, its customers may or may not be protected depending on the country. In the US we have the FDIC/NCUA, in Canada there's the CDIC and provinces individually backing up credit unions, and most EU countries have similar bodies agreeing to protect customers in the event of a bank default.
The issue: Nothing similar exists for Bitcoin, and certainly not for anything held with MtGox.
@_date: 2014-08-03 08:09:29
Unfortunately, down here in the States ING Direct became Capital One 360. It's free like Tangerine up north, but when there are direct banks here that refund ATM operator surcharges, and they don't, why would I use them?

@_date: 2014-10-05 20:40:44
No, that's because they don't understand that Discover is treated the same as a local credit/debit card on the backend.
@_date: 2014-03-25 06:24:12
I thought that one was "here for good"? Still works.
@_date: 2014-10-15 23:28:29
On the other hand, Icesave came and went without a UK banking license. Remember how badly that went down?
@_date: 2014-10-06 01:31:21


No they don't. I say this as someone with a Chinese credit card and three Chinese debit cards. I was asked when applying for my credit card whether I wanted a PIN on it, and if so, if I wanted to set a PIN waiver for purchases below a certain amount. They swipe the card, you push "enter" when it asks you for a PIN, done. With my debit cards, you can set aside a certain amount to be used for PIN-less transactions as well, but only if it's a chip card. 


I changed my mind about that after the third fake bill. When I'm there I try to go cash-less as much as I possibly can, and if I must carry it, to do so in small denominations wherever possible. 
And frankly, given how little paperwork (show them your passport, fill in the one-page account opening form, give them your foreign currency to exchange to local currency, they hand you a debit card with your exchanged money in it there and then) and fees (the big banks don't charge *any* maintenance fee no matter how little you've got in there) involved in getting a Chinese bank account I recommend anyone bringing large amounts of money to get one.
@_date: 2014-10-18 06:29:49
And the way it's implemented in Japan, this isn't an issue. I tap my phone and that's it, the security being that balances on your mobile payment apps there are segregated from your actual bank account/credit card. You have to manually add more money to your phone as needed.
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:29:09


In which case there must be a few banks doing something different to accommodate non-residents, and I'm guessing whatever they're doing is beyond the reach of smaller banks and credit unions. 


Well, it's still no-fee checking, which (like ING Direct in Canada) is more than can be said of the big banks in America. The initial account opening bonus was nice (10 debit transactions and poof, $150- who am I to complain), but yeah, I've moved my business elsewhere after meeting the requirements. 
For actual checks I have my free first box of checks from my student accounts with Citi and BMO-Harris, and for other things I have an account with my local credit union here (which charges me to use my card internationally, charges me for checks, etc) or Schwab (really great international support, doesn't charge for things my credit union does charge for, and they have offices in the bigger cities that can take check deposits, if not cash).
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:03:46
Hong Kong is still very much an independent entity, financially speaking.

@_date: 2015-03-23 14:54:00
what I mean is that here in the US I can get bank cards that charge me *absolutely nothing* when I use them abroad. They even reimburse ATM owner fees. This is less common outside the US.

And this is why I just used Schwab when I was in a similar situation. They have intermediary accounts in most of the major financial centers of the world, so I just wired money to their intermediary account in Hong Kong, specified my brokerage account number in the memo field, and the money showed up in my Schwab account in ~4 hours. Automatic, free overdraft from brokerage meant I didn't have to manually move the money to checking. Pricey? Kind of. No paperwork beyond the usual wire form, though.
@_date: 2015-02-21 22:03:28
Dunno what kind of backwards bank you're using. Mine calls me after the fact to ask if it was me who actually swiped the card.

Unless it's Square. They only charge 2.75% on everything (yes, even AmEx) for merchants in North America and 3.25% for merchants in Japan. Do you not have anything like that where you are? Most small merchants I talk to around here love it because it's so cheap to use. I have a close friend who runs a small business and is mostly able to take credit cards because Square takes so little.
EDIT: You must be European. The only other person I've ever talked to who complained about having to pay up to 8% on international card transactions was a merchant based in the UK. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 07:18:03


There's Square for that.


Visa, at least, publishes their base interchange rates [here]( International cards as a whole actually cost LESS to accept than the equivalent rewards card in the US. A Visa Infinite card costs less than 2% to process, and that's the highest level of rewards card in most of the world.
Visa Signature Preferred cards issued in the US are the only personal cards to have a base interchange rate higher than 2% across the board, and I have yet to see anyone issue one. Visa Signature cards go above 2% only at certain categories of merchant (dining and travel). 
TL;DR- Merchant processors would have to be charging pretty high markups to make any cards cost "way more than 3%" to process. If Square can bring it down to a flat 2.75% for everything I don't see how other merchant processors could get away with charging over 3% for anything.
Corporate cards are a whole different story, but getting companies to give their employees expense accounts denominated in BTC is going to be an uphill battle at best.
@_date: 2015-02-09 04:15:38

I've seen exactly one online merchant ever that didn't require at least name on top of expiry and CVC, and that was a cellphone provider in Hong Kong (actually, they didn't even require the CVC, but then again, they have a phone they can go after if a chargeback occurs). Buying Wii Points on the console (man, that was a long time ago) required only name/expiry/CVC on top of the card number. 
All other places I've shopped have at least required the billing address as well, and those are going to take a lot more work to brute force.
