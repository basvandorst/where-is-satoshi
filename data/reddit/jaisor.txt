Pi, case, SD card, wifi=$60, Erupters=$120 (ashamed to admin I got them for $40 a pop), Small parts=$20 (fan, cables), the rest I had. Total cost $200. 
Consuming 14W, power will cost about $1.5/mo. At the current difficulty, it will mine about 0.0183 BTC per month. With price about $760, this is roughly $11.75 (after electricity costs) per month.
Originally I was hoping to average $25/mo and pay for the rig in 8-9 months, but the difficulty shot up. Even if I keep it at my desk at work as a conversation piece and save on power, it will be 2 years before it pays the equipment. At least the RPi is salvageable for other projects.
TLDR; Not quite sideways 8 but very close to it for practical purposes.

Here is an album with the stills 
If I had better reddit smarts I should have taken photos while putting it together, oh well.
The 3 Erupters fit perfectly on the back of that old CPU heat sink I had. Had to drill shallow holes for the nubs of the Erupters' plastic screws. A handier person should tap holes with the same thread and screw the ASICs directly to the metal. I copped out using a wire to secure them, zip tie probably would work better. I also used a layer of [Arctic Silver thermal paste]( which sealed any gaps very nicely and helped solidify the mount.
Initially I did not have a fan and was very surprised what difference it made. Without it, the aluminum chunk got as hot as the Erupters alone. With it, its cold to the touch.
The fan is [a cheap 5v]( and is a bit loud but its powered directly from the Raspi GPIO with a quick pin rearrangement of its connector.

Yes, 3x ASICMiner Block Erupter 333MH/s. Averages 1 GH/s.

Wow, very close :) Was my first try at this type of gif. I tried to shoot from the same angle, rotating the rig by hand after each shot. The goal was for the rig to remain centered, didn't give a crap about the table. Slight movements of the hand caused small changes in angle which afterwards resulted in morphing.

Amazon has a good variety of USB cables, sizes and types

At-least few months to break even, but I wasn't chasing profit. Wanted to get familiar with the crypto currencies and put together an energy efficient rig. The entire setup draws about 14W which can be solar supplied.
