Right, it could be.  Doesn't appear so, but you never know.  I was mostly curious why someone would want bitcoin over cash when they could easily buy double the bitcoin with the potential extra cash they get for something like this.  I'm assuming just laziness.

Good idea,  I should probably inquire directly with him why it's such a good deal.

 Definitely hope this is the case!

I don't associate it with shady activity by any means,  I just know it has more potential for me to get screwed than cash considering I don't 100% know what I'm doing.  
And yeah i know its outdated,  but my current xbox keeps getting the rrod,  I've tried all the options for fixing it and I'm kind of sick of dealing with it.

Haha craigslist with escrow, I think not.  They wouldn't be shipping it, it's craigslist, I'd be meeting them. 
I'm relatively new to bitcoin, figured I would ask before I do something stupid.  No matter how much I read up about it, of course there will be something unforeseen.

Its not.  They openly stated in the post that they know how good of a deal it is.

Where are you looking? For the slim,  I find that hard to believe someone is selling a brand new one for $100

I have yet to actually do it,  but I know I have plenty of resources at my disposal to figure it out.  It just seemed too good to be true since the seller could get potentially twice the profit if he took cash instead of bitcoin.  I was curious if there's anything in particular I need to watch out for,  as I haven't done a bitcoin transaction before.

Thanks for looking! That's pretty standard for the elite it seems like though sadly.  I was specifically looking for the slim version as its less prone to the red ring,  which goes for a bit more typically.
