In the West you still can make profit! Not that fast as they do in China but it is possible ;) 
But you are right, they really are in a good position.

1 cent per kWh I heard
@_date: 2015-06-28 10:59:32
but aswell the older miners go offline I think, so question is how far the diff will rise
@_date: 2015-06-28 11:45:17
oh, that sounds hard. When will it be? Every 3 months or?
@_date: 2015-06-28 10:25:11
Is there a fixed rate where you can say how much this will affect mining? and how high do you think it will rise?
@_date: 2015-06-16 19:34:56
But what is it? :) Multiple investors who finally see the potential? 
@_date: 2015-06-11 07:39:46
That's the first time I post this! Also it is a win-win ;)

Alibaba is from China. Bitcoin won`t be a payment possibility
@_date: 2014-10-12 12:08:30

@_date: 2014-10-25 12:10:02
write about Blockchain 2.0, Internet of things, the Sidechain etc. 6 pages should be easy to write. 
If you need help contact me. I am a writer for cointelegraph, cryptocoinsnews and two german blogs :)
@_date: 2014-08-26 09:27:25
finally something is going on there :)
@_date: 2014-08-25 09:15:57
eine mögliche Regulierung bringt Rechtssicherheit mit sich. Das heißt, Händler können sich eher auf Bitcoin einlassen, weil sie wissen, was sie zu versteuern haben. Eine weite Verbreitung hängt meiner Meinung davon ab.

:D falsch formuliert. "SPD spricht über Bitcoin"
@_date: 2015-05-03 11:24:41

@_date: 2016-01-20 17:59:52
you ordered?
@_date: 2016-01-20 13:05:06
yes, def looks like a scam. but would be great to find some people who ordered although I hope there are only a few of them. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 05:57:40
yes, that is my opinion, too. I had a lot of issues where I needed support and after I contacted them I never heard a word although I offered them a good sum of BTC...

Apple produces things everyone wants to have. (or better: everyone thinks he need to have those things)
Bitcoin needs to get into that too to achieve such a market cap.

700 000 000 000 000 / 15 000 000= 46,6 mios

don't speculate on a higher price if you can't afford it. college goes first. Bitcoin is highly speculativ. Probably it is worth 0 in a year....
Nah, just kiddin. It will be worth thousands. I understand your dilemma
