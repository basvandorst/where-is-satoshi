This is r/bitcoin, don't expect anybody to have any facts
@_date: 2013-09-19 04:15:17
Well I've been informed that bit coin can only process 60,000 transactions per day, which makes it useless for the purpose of micro payments (as it currently stands)
If that wasnt a problem perhaps this would actually be an area bitcoin could flourish

Steam saves all your details, buying a game is a quick and easy process. Much easier than trying to a secure a "bit coin"

Fine, it is a combination of its extraordinary properties, incredible beauty AND its scarcity. But that goes back to my original point. If it was scarce, ugly and useless it wouldn't be worth anything. Scarcity alone is not a measure of value. It is idiotic to say that bitcoins are valuable because they are "scarce." And that was what I was pointing out with my original comment.

How is it not applicable? "Sorry I can't pay my 50k deposit today, bitcoin dropped 16% and I lost 8k. I'll pay another day when hopefully it goes back up"

The average person doesn't give a crap about almost instant (not instant!!!) International transfers. When was the last time you did one?

You really use those on your phone?? Seems gimmicky to me. The iPhone does have superior audio quality to the S3 (at least)
@_date: 2013-09-17 04:29:35
Cool way to break your phone brah
@_date: 2013-09-16 01:02:18
LOL why would you want to convert your BTC into filthy, inflationary fiat. You don't get point of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-09-17 04:46:26
Its a popular idiom, not really related to beerfest. Yeah I see it all too much on this sub. Nobody can take criticism of bitcoin and immediately blame the poster. If you want BTC to grow you need to listen to these people.

Buy some bitcoins, that way mine will be worth even more.
@_date: 2013-09-10 03:41:57
Excuse my ignorance, but how is this related to a free society? Couldnt this just as easily be done through fiat? 
@_date: 2013-09-19 00:41:46
You should keep grounded in reality rather than fantasising about jizzworthy scenarios that will never eventuate. OMG imagine if you had to pay .01 btc for each YouTube view *fapfapfap*

How many CEOs or PHDs have you asked that to?
@_date: 2013-09-21 06:36:28
People have been downvoting other submissions of this because it doesn't discuss bitcoin with the pants-wetting enthusiasm shown in this sub. I think its a good piece and it is huge publicity for bitcoin
@_date: 2013-09-24 06:21:42
You sound like someone who drank the kool aid and is just regurgitating stuff you've read elsewhere. If you read my post, I asked for what comprises the bulk of the bitcoin economy? Not "OMG what can I buy with bitcoin in a hypothetical world." I want to know what they're being spent on right now. And its drugs and gambling as far as I can tell. (Notice I'm not bringing up illegal porn and weapons cause I think they're overstated and disingenuous arguments)
@_date: 2013-09-18 00:02:38
wait is this true? I have never heard that mentioned before. That is laughably bad
@_date: 2013-09-17 03:15:16
This is a retarded attitude to have if you want BTC to become popular.
@_date: 2013-09-15 01:50:43
@_date: 2013-09-23 02:52:13
Sounds like a scam... Get a bunch of investors and then a user with a Japanese sounding name (surprised it wasn't Satoshi) wins all their bets and cleans out all the investors cash. 
Given the track record of the BTC community, an outright scam is not an outrageous explanation.

This comes to mind - 
@_date: 2013-09-24 06:22:47
You'll never be a captain of industry with that attitude, my friend. You could argue that stating gold has no value other than scarcity, for the sake of peddling your internet coins, is just as puerile. It shows 0 understanding of the real world. Who really thinks gold has no value other than scarcity? A wikipedia page, or a high school science education, would correct that view quite easily.
@_date: 2013-09-19 01:40:59
This might eventuate... With adblock used by a large % of users, content providers will need to find a new way to monetise their content.
I could see bitcoin being used here, but I'm skeptical of what advantage it would really offer over $? There's also the option that users will simply decide they don't want to pay for "Awesome Vines 2013 XD" and would rather stop viewing the content
@_date: 2013-09-24 08:03:40
 Thanks for your response. Unfortunately yes it is impossible to get real figures. When you say transactions, do you mean trades on mtgox etc ie bitcoin being traded and not really spent? The mining thing is interesting, its like the majority of bitcoin are being spent on other bitcoins or just traded for cash.
@_date: 2013-09-19 04:48:28
I don't completely understand that link but I'll take your word for it. The bit coin community should be able to figure a way around this. Bit coin needs to be easier to use before it gets bigger
@_date: 2013-09-18 00:13:53
I'm 13 and I agree with this
@_date: 2013-09-24 06:59:43
" Of all the minerals mined from the Earth, none is more useful than gold. Its usefulness is derived from a diversity of special properties. Gold conducts electricity, does not tarnish, is very easy to work, can be drawn into wire, can be hammered into thin sheets, alloys with many other metals, can be melted and cast into highly detailed shapes, has a wonderful color and a brilliant luster." - Hobart M. King, Ph.D in Geology 
Thats from the first result I got. There's so many results... Would you like me to post more? Is a government source good enough? How about you just read the  wikipedia page? Fucking hell, are you really this ignorant or just brainwashed by bitcoiners who hate gold and fiat?
Ohhh you've been an adult for over 30 (wow!) years so you know everything. Please enlighten us to your wisdom, Methuselah.

@_date: 2013-09-23 23:43:58
Well, what else is bitcoin used for? and don't tell me you're buying pizzas and children's books online, I'm talking about bulk of the economy

You still haven't figured out you were scammed? Jesus Christ. In other news, I have an ASIC miner here for pre-order, are you interested?
@_date: 2013-09-19 03:12:41
10 million? Jesus hope he paid tax on that. Or are you referring to the assumed value of bit coins? I'd like to see him get $10 million out of mtgox. Genuinely curious on this BTW!

Uh isn't that exactly what happened with bitcoin? Very early adopters mining thousands of coins quickly, spruiking their awesome new currency and convincing people to buy it, then they sell off and get rich. The second wave of people do the same thing etc.
@_date: 2013-09-17 02:58:00
OK, but how hard is it to get the BTC in the first place and convert it back to use able currency at the other end?
