Well, if you think about it... Intergalactically, in the future, the only universal value store that could be used for fluid exchange between space faring civilizations will pretty much, exclusively be energy, or currency representative of the energy used to generate it.

Bitcoin's market cap is approaching Lehman Brother's
Once Bitcoin passes that mark, if Bitcoin is still a "bubble" "scam" or "pyramid scheme" it will be the most successful one ever, in history.
Any financial sector expert saying bunk bunk bunk, only bunk on Bitcoin, is an idiot, and needs to learn when to hold their hand and make calls, rather than bets or folds.

Gold was a currency once.
If I put currency in one hand, and gold in the other, which would you take from me?

If you are swayed by this type of garbage media, we don't want you to be a long term holder anyway.
Bitcoin must be immune to panic. In order for that to be the case, those who panic sell, need to be made to panic in small increments, rather than one giant exodus.
(They are thinking of letting Yellowstone have small eruptions, to relieve pressure so that a big one doesn't happen.)

I have a specific method. Kinda secret, though. Honestly I can't remember if I'm allowed to use this for a civilian operation or not... It probably doesn't matter as long as I don't tell anyone what I am actually using to locate it, so I guess no special skills that I am able to talk about freely.

I have a personal psychological barrier soon.
$680 Billion is VERY important
Once Bitcoin passes 680B I will feel much better about it.
(Lehman Brothers had a cap of 680B, when outed as a scam/subprime practices.)
If Bitcoin can eclipse that, then any idiot with their fingers in their ears screaming "nananananana I can't hear you, Bitcoin is a scam."
Will inadvertently be having to argue that Bitcoin is the largest scam ever in history.
At that point it's either:
1. You believe Bitcoin is really the future of finance and money.
2. You want to keep buying magazines and newspapers after the year 2000, because news on the internet isn't "real news" and the internet is a scam.

Honestly, Bcrash shouldn't exist.

I thought you might actually be replying seriously, right up until the very last word.
Once you actually hinted at considering monero, I knew for sure, you must be trolling. haha

I'm more interested in seeing John McAfee eat his own dick. (He said he would if Bitcoin isn't 1 mil each, by 2020)

You appear to be supporting this attack on the Bitcoin network.
I'm not saying that you are a paid shill or someone involved with the Seg2x decision, but I would say if something looked like chocolate milk, smelled like chocolate milk, and tasted like chocolate milk, then it is probably chocolate milk.

Um, we are having a discussion about why grass is green, and you are telling me about brown fences. 
The fact: A group of dbags decided to change Bitcoin behind closed doors, in a non streamed and non broadcasted event.
-----&gt;If they wanted my trust, all it would have taken is a webcam.&lt;-----
Seriously. The fact that this is the issue, is the issue. That was EASY everyone carries a portable internet streaming device in their freaking pocket these days.
They explicitly chose NOT to make this meeting part of the public eye of scrutiny.
If they want my support, postpone the fork, host an open hearing. Redo the fork. If the fork is really that important, this is a completely reasonable request.
However, if their intentions are questionable and sketchy, they will try to force this through as quickly as they can, without gaining open consensus, which appears to be their current MO.
So pardon me for being a little...
I'm open to converting to full Seg2x support, are they open to giving me their side of this push? The fact that there is a lack of transparency trouble me, much more than the fact that we are forking. I've been in Bitcoin since 2010, I have never seen a hard fork happen without crystal clear transparency, until NOW.
