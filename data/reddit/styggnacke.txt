Yeah fees will surely go up again before we have stable LN and Schnorr. That's why I took this opportunity and moved the coins today.
Some people might be waiting for bech32 support, or for p2sh-p2wpkh support in their favorite wallet - but I still think it's a good idea to start today (using Electrum for example) and then maybe transfer to bech32 later. Transfer from p2sh-p2wpkh will be relatively cheap at that point.

If an exchange does not support bech32, then they cannot *send* to a bech32 address.

I'm using wallets created by Electrum 2.9 (non-segwit addresses). I want to start using SegWit but I'm hesitating because I don't fully grasp all aspects of it. I would like to know:
1. Using Electrum 3, would it be better to create bech32 addresses or P2SH-P2WPKH?
2. Would either of these formats prevent me from *recieving* BTC from any kind of BTC wallet, such as Coinbase?
3. Would either of these formats prevent me from *sending* BTC to any kind of BTC wallet?
4. What is the recommended strategy of moving BTC funds to the new segwit supported wallet (with as low fees as possible, even if it takes a few days)?

Yeah I like that these old people find it interesting to talk about even though most of their understanding is inaccurate. It seems like many laypersons are focused on the mining, they seem to think that's how you get coins. Nowadays it's futile to start mining on a home computer. I wish they were discussing the deflationary aspects of it, how it's borderless, how it compares to gold/silver assets etc.

Actually it is. When you use crypto to buy goods or services, the value you are using in the transaction must be converted to the official currency of your tax home to calculate the tax. It's called [Barter Trade](
