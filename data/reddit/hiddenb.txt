Apart from that there aren't/haven't been any other wallet apps.
[Edit]: [Here's the reason]( it's no longer available:
@_date: 2014-01-18 23:32:44
Because they don't have enough capital to produce unlimited miners. If they sell the then they can produce as many as the market will demand.
@_date: 2014-04-26 12:25:13
China + MtGox, that can't be good for the price.
@_date: 2014-02-21 13:05:41
You can't withdraw BITCOIN from MtGox, therefore you CAN'T sell on Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-06-19 04:48:24
My basic argument is that if you are going to have regulation, regulate access to the infastructrue, and let the free market do the rest.
Some people may want a provider who advertises themselves as "net neutral", and others may opt for one that offers higher speeds to a limited number of sites. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 23:07:23


And how exactly do they do that? I'm sure the only people who are interested in this already know about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-26 09:38:30
People will get at least a portion back. MtGox have announced they have 200,000 Bitcoins, so those will probably be given back (although costs may use up some).

Risky, you could sell half of them now at bitcoinbuilder.com to get the 30k back and hold the rest risk free.

What? Isn't it the responsibility of the merchant to collect sales taxes. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 09:35:03
People will most likely get something back, but not all. It could be as low as 10 cents in the dollar, depends on how many more coins they "find".
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:29:04
It may do or it may not. It just depends on supply and demand.

I'm not quite sure what this means, but I suspect it's one of two things.

I see it this way. Bitcoin has a scalability problem (7tps). So while you may be able to transfer Bitcoin on the Blockchain for a low cost right now, you won't when we need over 7tps. Third parties are going to be necessary to conduct off chain transactions (of course someone could come up with a decentralized system for this), why would Visa and MasterCard not leverage their dominant position in payments to be come the dominant Bitcoin processor?

That won't crush Bitcoin, just drop the price a little, Bitstamp often trades more than 30,000 a day. The price might move down by $100 or so (some other people would join in, so they could buy back after a potential panic), but BTC would be back up within a week.

The further north you go the more people there are. 
The South Island (which is about 30% larger than the North) has most of the National Parks, as it is more mountainous. The total population of the South Island is about 1,050,000 and about 380,000 of those live in Christchurch.
The North Island has a larger population of 3,422,000 and about 1,530,000 of those live in NZ's largest city Auckland.

That's one way to put it. John Banks who was the Act Party's sole MP has just been forced to resign over a conviction relating to 'anonymous' donations from Kim Dotcom.

It apparently adds 8x more to the blockchain than Bitcoin. The Bitcoin blockchain is ~21GB, if Bitcoin used ring signatures it would already be 168GB. I think with a blockcahin this size the main problem would be bandwidth, rather than storage.

Darkcoin has something like this. Master Nodes (nodes used to make sending anonymous) require the owner of the node to have 1000DRK in their wallet. In return for processing the transactions, and locking up 1000DRK (it still belongs to the owner of the node, just can't be used while the node is active), the owners will receive 10% of the mining reward, sent to a random Master Node each block.

NO. You trade Gox BTC for Real BTC. Currently 1 Gox BTC = .4 Real BTC. This is just an easy way for people to buy Gox BTC (it's hard to get money into Gox), and a way for people who already own Gox BTC to get their BTC out (at a loss, currently of 60%).
Of course if you have $ in Gox already (or can get them in) you can buy Gox BTC for around $150 and then sell them to Bitcoin Builder for about $230.

From a quick look it seems they didn't really pay the debt down. Debt did decrease as a percentage of GDP, but mainly due to high growth in GDP.
The problem now though is there hasn't really been any growth for the last 6 years, and no sign of any major change to that. 
They could handle the debt, but it will require some drastic changes tot eh US economy. Government revenue needs to increase a lot, either due to growth or higher taxes, and spending needs big decreases.

I have no problem with that, companies should be free to operate whatever business model works best, if that means charging service providers so be it. I believe however if there is enough competition in the market this will not happen. There is clearly high support for net neutrality, so in a competitive market a company could advertise itself as being net neutral, and I'm sure it would win a lot of customers.
The problem of net neutrality is one of competition. If you want the FCC to do anything it should be to lower the barriers of entry. 
There are plenty of [countries where there are no net neutrality rules]( and the sky hasn't fallen in.

It's similar, there's just more far more coins and there are less people mining so less people to compete with.

* No ID requirement or even requirements to use your real name.
* Only .5% commission.
* No NZD deposit or withdraw fees.
* No Bitcoin deposit fees.
* Cash deposits (they don't take online deposits) of NZD show up the next business day.
* When one of my deposits had the wrong reference number, they replied to my email on the morning of the next business day and immediately added it to my account. 
I'm going to be spending a lot of next year in Australia, but I think I will just arrange to have people deposit here for me.

That is idealism, you somehow expect to change human nature itself. Anarcho-capitalism however makes allowances for human nature, rather than trying to change it.


Fine, how is anarcho-communism formed by nature.


I would argue the opposite (no surprise).
@_date: 2013-12-30 13:10:08
People want to sell their goods/services for as high price as possible. The price will be driven higher by more demand (more people on your site). Therefore you need the maximum number of people to use your site. As Bitcoin is only used by a small section of the population a lot of people will not bother with your site when there are other options that they see as less risky/easier.
Include Bitcoin as a payment option, but do not limit your site to only Bitcoin. If part of your goal is to introduce people to Bitcoin make your site as mainstream as possible.

* Again it can all be private
* Why should the government subsidize farmers?
* Private roads are entirely possible, many even exist today (although most are in some sort of government partnership).
* Space is going increasingly private, SpaceX has billions in private launches lined up (one scheduled for 3 Jan).
* Why should the government have anything to do with trade.
* Emergency Management would be a lot cheaper than the other things listed. There are also ways to have it

I'm no expert on mining but I can answer most of your questions. 
First, it's not worth it. To make money mining Bitcoin you will end specialized hardware, not a "Radeon AMD graphics card". Using that the cost of your electricity will be far higher than the value of the Bitcoin you mine.
* No you don't need a mobile device.
* You don't need any mobile apps.
* I don't know much about what is the best software to use.
* You will need a Bitcoin wallet, this can a downloadable wallet on your PC or a web wallet (e.g. Blockchain.info).
