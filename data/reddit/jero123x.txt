But that would just be an assumption on your part right. This guy has been an invited speaker at several crypto events I believe. So he has to be more knowledgeable then most right?

There is no indication of that.

Not sure where you are from. US banks aren't playing either! Chase bank nor Citi will allow crypto businesses to have a merchant account. Now the part that got me is he doesn't have a direct crypto business he is simply selling educational courses about crypto. Not sure who stripes "banking partner" is. My first thought was I wonder if it's "Chase".

You make good point. I can't speak on his motives but two things I thought about. As a business owner wouldn't you go where the customers are? If the customers are in Fiat then that would make sense. This whole thing will not work until the customers decided it's better for them to be in crypto instead of fiat? Second point, in the video he specifically explains that his course are about taking newbies and teaching them about crypto. So if that is his audience doesn't it make sense to expect them to pay with fiat since they are still in the introductory phase of crypto?

That is exactly what it's looking like the past hour with this big pull back suddenly.

Nothing is misrepresented in anyway? Where is the scam?

You are right about spending more time and electricity. In the first video, I talked about my purpose in doing this. I believe crypto has a very strong use case in countries that don't have the strong banking systems that we have. I think for the most part they would be the only population that would even attempt this with any consistency. I hope to just bring more awareness to crypto.
