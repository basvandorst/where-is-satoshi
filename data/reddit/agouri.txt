Oh, thankfully it was back when it was around ~150$ per BTC.
But MY deciBTC were bought at ~1000$ per, should *I* be worried?
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:38:36
tl;dr: OP lost some money because he treated BTC like shares, got mad and posted this.
A seller that isn't interested in storing BTC in his wallet and just wants fiat currency can instantly convert it to USD/EUR on the time of purchase, thereby retaining all the positives of Bitcoin even if he's going to convert back to fiat anyway.
Stop treating BTC like shares. You're not here to get rich. You're here to be part of the future of monetary units.

btc-e, from a programmer's point of view. Its architecture is built around customer security on a very big part.
And I'm absolutely sure that if you explain your case as fluently as you did here, they'll understand.
You must know that you're a high-risk customer for them.
All the best from me, though, man.

HEY GUYS, JUST GOT HOME.
Yeah, apologies to all of you for not reasoning as to why the code is bad.
In this python script, the most agonizing faults are the following:
• while(true): This is pain. Pure pain. This is literally cancer for your computer. It's an infinite, non-breakpoint loop that essentially "burns" cycles of your CPU doing the exact same thing over and over again. And this "same thing" is quite big.
• The programmer of the script kind of saw this and wanted to work around the issue with time.sleep(). While sleep() avoids running the ~20 lines of code in the loop, it still burns through CPU cycles. Sleep() doesn't reroute to another thread if not built around that idea. The while(true) waste is retained.
• Apart from that, the whole usage of while(true) without breaks (not that it'd be better with them) is very goto-esque and every young coder-ling is taught to avoid it like the plague, for the reasons listed above.
It is a needless perma-running process for something that could easily be built with semaphores or other signalling architecture and works the same way but utilising 1% of the resources.
I do NOT want to insult the coder. His script is fun and a beautiful novel idea. But I twitched when I saw the program.

You know, I don't really see it as second fiddle.
You can't take risks when you're a country, a nation of highly educated and productive people. It's better to wait and see how things go (is 1-2 years of delay that much, when we're talking country scale?) instead of rushing ahead and potentially damaging some government structure.
Speaking of results, Sweden is, at least for a CompSci BSc Greek, paradise. Quality of life, size of job-reward, everything.
I'd say one of the strongest socialist countries in the EU know what they're doing.

Hey 
I've got access to two 100/100mbps machines running off the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki network, in Greece.
Until you find a more permanent solution I'll be happy to act as a mirror so you can distribute the book.
The web service of one of my servers can currently be found at: 
The second machine isn't reachable by web yet and I can set it up for you if you'd like. Do you own a domain name?
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:30:00
I'm sorry if it's a bit irrelevant, but do you have any kits designed to be fitted on a motorcycle?
I've been a motorcyclist for one year and I've already witnessed a car crash. It was horrible being unable to do anything because I couldn't have an emergency kit on the bike.
Girl turned out okay, though.
@_date: 2013-12-01 10:30:54
Friend, I know how it is to have experienced a "hit" like that.
It was good of you to get it out of your chest. Now start working on salvaging because it looks like your life also got a big hit, what with the appartment and job loss.

Tough situation indeed.
You got a driving license? Any university or other government-issued ID? Those HAVE to be bound to a street adress, don't they?
Also, if there are no street addresses, how do you find stuff?
"Turn left at the 19th street"? Even Malawi has street adresses, despite the poverty. I should know, I visit it often.

Checkmate atheists.

Same situation there too, I suppose. Is this a purely American thing?
@_date: 2013-12-04 23:02:20
EDIT: I mean, come on, basic fucking if-else clause. If he's got access to &gt;12000 accounts, active ones, probably with buttcoins or at least accounts that take part in transactions, why would he not be getting the BTC from them, silently?

Being a greek, this kinda hurts.
@_date: 2013-12-01 11:23:45
Then it's probably just a problem of the balkans being behind things, as always.
@_date: 2013-12-02 07:20:45
Because they are no longer needed as the median. The transaction can take place between two clients without transfer costs, instantly, and is completely anonymous (and to a degree untrackable, if you make arrangements).
You're damn right they'll be afraid of BTC. It's literally their death.
Bit of a strong word there, death.
But yeah.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:34:35
Please, keep us posted and ask me if you need help with anything.
I checked their Facebook wall and it's a bit suspicious that they turned wall-posts off. There's some comment-replies on their posts complaining about log-in problems, although there are other saying "nvm, I can log back in now".
As  said, it's been a weird week for Americans. Thanksgiving, Black Friday, the weekend. Stop stressing yourself and keep in mind that you can try again tomorrow ;)

Are you, by any chance, a "high level programmer"?
You have no idea of the function of a proc on the machine. 
Does sleep() run on fairy dust?
In this context it's essentially a while(true) loop. It always is, but at least if you implement multithreading the cpu burn becomes less noticeable.
@_date: 2013-12-02 07:56:57
96k is more than enough to spark a drop. Did sheepmarketplace really pull a runner?
Not that I wouldn't expect it from an exchange with a name like that, but seriously?

Can I have a buttcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:45:35
* Maybe if you were taught programming in a barn. While(true) is humongous unnecessary workload for problems that can solved with signalling 99% of the time.
* Where do you see multithreading handlers in the program? Sleep does nothing in this script.
* Where do you see handling for non-console executions of the script? Is this reason enough not to add breakpoints into an already terrible loop structure?
