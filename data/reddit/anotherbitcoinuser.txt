Honestly mate, this looks like clear fraud and there is every chance because of your employment it's you who are the fraudster.
Do you really wish to make a living from theft?
Can you find gainful employment elsewhere which doesn't involve such unethical behaviour?
Would your life be improved by not having to lie to people (and yourself) all day long?

It's something about Digital ID, you can signup for some kind of lowest-tender insecure ID system to KYC yourself without selfies.


It's bullshit.

"close", but not decentralised. Developer is the arbitrator.


When? Been Soon™ for a good while now. Don't see any links to any announcements or code in this article. No source on this claim?


*"It's harder to code correctly, so we'll be more secure for sure!"* huh?

Forget NSA, assume compromised by anyone.


You wanted to secure it *physically* in another off-site location. Then why did you transmit it *digitally* over an open channel as an unencrypted voice signal?
Time was on your side, you had plenty to prepare some more thoughtful way of transmitting a secret.
You don't transmit secrets over open channels. You just don't.
The key is to be assumed compromised, it's position in your fathers *"safe"* is irrelevant. Could be that it's emptied after you spend a few decades using it. Make a new set of keys and keep them safe this time.
You could have exchanged PGP public keys with your father over an open channel and then encrypted it at the very least. Though you'd still probably end up typing it into a internet connected device at some point and thus compromising it.

No. You're doing it wrong. You're setting people up to lose all their change the first time they spend anything. It will be sent to an address they do not have a private key for.
    So-called paper wallets are an obsolete and unsafe method of storing bitcoin 
    which should not be recommended to beginners. They simply store a single 
    private/public keypair on paper. They promote address reuse and require 
    unwieldy and complicated live OS system boots to be safe, they risk theft 
    by printers, and typically rely on Javascript cryptography.
    Paper wallets also do not provide any method of displaying to the user when 
    money has arrived. There's no practical way to use a full node wallet, users 
    are typically driven to use third-party blockchain explorers which can lie 
    to them and spy on them.
    A much better way accomplish what paper wallets do is to use seed phrases instead.
Honestly, a deterministic seed phrase is infinitely better. There is no reason to be recording single public/private key pairs like the dark ages. This article is entirely bad advice.
Yes you can use Bitcoin in this way, though if you don't have a very detailed understanding of the protocol you may well fail catastrophically with a simple and easy to make error.

Miners reward amount which comes with finding a new block.
Which changes the inflation picture and has an effect of increasing the value of coins over time.

Nothing in the standard methods which says they must have anything to restrict anyone.
There is an `approve` method which gives others permission to transfer some number of your coins and a `transfer` function to do that exchange. edit: Well technically you use `transferFrom` to utilise that "approved" balance.
The `transfer` function could have extra logic added to it. Balances may be stored in more than one variable with adjustments possible or whatever. You can do anything you like with the code to implement your own version of a token with it's own specific behaviour.

Chicken and egg. Think the way it's going to go is off-chain on-ramping with Eltoo or some channel factory mechanism.
Small vendor becomes the on-ramp rather than needing a large exchange. They can then offer giving you your change from cash on LN instead of in fiat. 
Now the next time you come past that vendor your transaction is done in half the time, then you notice another vendor and network effect takes off.
If this was doable today I'd probably setup a store at the local markets (or many markets) selling trinkets and on-ramping people with as few legal obstacles as possible. Like ATM business but less overhead or risk.

Nothing quite as entertaining as opening a fully functional bash console in a public space on a device with wireless capabilities. ;)

Of course. The US government would require it.

Just to hit this again, you never see people talking about it. Not on the radar but going to be a huge deal.
Currently you can't really buy Bitcoin without some KYC or exposure to the risk of it through a 3rd party dispute mediation process. 
Offering it for sale on services where this is near possible (BISQ, HodlHodl, LocalBitcoins) includes a lot of risk as you are exposed to traditional banking chargebacks and the like.
Yet when you're holding someones cash in your hand and giving them a few bucks change on a channel after that fact, nearly all the risk evaporates. The whole transaction becomes mundane and lackadaisical rather than some complex task involving multiple 3rd parties, registrations and legal checks.

They're not interested in making money on coin sales volume. They make money on transactions people then make with those coins. It's a long game to build their market.
The smaller their margin on the spread the more effective their progress towards actual goals.
Peanuts today or peanut trees tomorrow.

They are a fresh payment processing company.
They need to set themselves up for the future or they are simply Paypal and another one which will in time fail to innovate and be lost to history.
Lightning Network to them sounds both cheap and gives them a way out of being controlled by monopolies above their pay grade. It is a no-brainer to begin work in that direction if it costs very little while providing an "out" for the company in future.
They gain very little attention from Bitcoin, what they gain is potential future pathways which see them remain relevant where everyone else fades into history.

Man your article is pretty poor. I'm rather deep into it and all I hear so far is *"He big company, me no trust big company people!!"*

Did we just switch subjects from your claims of their Bitcoin adoption being about generating app downloads, to the topic of not being able to sell?
I maintain that your article doesn't justify it's claims, although it does spend a lot of time repeating your *opinion*.
@_date: 2018-11-11 23:53:18


I don't believe that is something you're capable of.

Because Bitcoin = freedom and if you don't buy a Purism laptop you hate freedom?


So they sell expensive hardware via crowdfunding? Neato. Good for them.
PureOS? So debian?
Will be good to see a return of open source debian phones. (Like the N900) Though not believing it will really happen.
