"Should you wish to re-create the ISO image written to disk, I have provided all of the necessary documentation to do so" I don't see this documentation on the site. Is it in the download?

Can you provide link to your real life identity? LinkIn profile etc? Why should we trust you? You provide source code, sure. But when download includes whole linux disco, there's no way to exclude possibility of backdoors. You are saying this is "verifiably secure" but you don't provide a procedure to verify the security.

let me try... say you own a wallet with 1 BTC. since you own it, you have the private key. what happens when you make a transaction from a regular BitCoin client? You enter a transaction into the client (e.g. transfer 0.3 BTC to address A and other 0.7 BTC to address B). BitCoin client will create a little packet describing the transaction, and signs it with your private key for the wallet. that signature is what proves that true owner of the wallet made the transaction. the transaction, with the signature is then broadcast to other BicCoin clients. At one point, miner will receive your transaction, verify the signature, verify it wasn't double-spent, and include it in the blockchain.
now, imagine physical coin is manufactured. when it's manufactured, a key pair is generated and private key is stored inside the coin. we assume manufacture is honest enough to destroy the private key, so the private key is only in the coin. nobody knows it, even the owner of the physical coin. how do you make a transaction with a coin like this? you enter your transaction on your bitcoin client (running on your phone). bitcoin client doesn't have a private key, so it can't sign transaction on it's own. it has to send the transaction to the coin. coin signs it with it's private key, and sends signed transaction back to bitcoin client (through NFC or some other means). bitcoin client then broadcasts the transaction. basically, the flow is the same as if bitcoin client has your private key, except with physical coin the transaction is routed through the physical coin for signing.
Hope my explanation is good:-)

that wouldn't be an upper limit if you consider people who keep their BTC in web-based wallets.

sorry, i guess my explanation wasn't good enough! the private key remains in the coin, it never leaves the coin. coin signs the transaction with private key, and the only thing which leaves the coin is the signature, not the key. key is never transmitted.
you cannot "see the key with the phone". again, key never leaves the coin.

damn this looks good

sorry, i don't know  the details, but it should be possible to make physical coin like that which doesn't reveal private key. enter transaction on your phone, send it to the coin, coin signs it and sends signed transaction back through NFC. don't see anything impossible here.

don't keep all your eggs in one basket. nobody should be putting all their savings in BTC.

Using Schiff's argument, you could argue that fiat money have an intrinsic value. You can write a phone number on a dollar bill. You can use dollar bill as a bookmark. You can use dollar bill instead of toilet paper.

i recommend you read up how digital signatures work:
you can check that you have bitcoins in your wallet using your public key. e.g.
you don't need private key to check balance.
BitCoins are not stored in the wallet. BitCoins are stored in the blockchain, which is public.
