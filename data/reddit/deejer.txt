I get what you're saying, and agree to some extent, but Schiff is saying that gold's value extends beyond it's use in exchange...because we desire it for itself. We will only ever desire BTC as a medium, never for itself.
My question (legitimately trying to understand) is how important is this feature of gold, truly?

I agree with you here. I believe we value mediums for their ex-changeability and general acceptance rather than their intrinsic value.

Sort of off topic, but I see what you're saying.

Ad hominem. Anything to say about his argument?

Good link, thanks. even lists "gold outside it's industrial use."
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:40:19
I agree. Schiff thinks this + makes gold better than BTC. We say fuck him.

I really should have made it more clear. My thoughts are fresh and cloudy, I apologize.

Ahh excellent point. These are the arguments i'm looking for, thank you.
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:12:15
And I hope it does! Because that is exactly what the debate comes down to.

 hopefully won't be an issue...but I wouldn't be too surprised.  is real, although the money it takes to secure gold is a dissuading factor whereas w/ btc it's secure unless the whole software comes down. No cost to the individual, only a slight risk.  is at the heart of what Schiff says. Does our confidence in a currency DEPEND on intrinsic value??

worth the whole thing.

Indeed that is a favorable feature of BTC, but not **intrinsic** **value.**  If there were a collapse in BTC and no one wanted them anymore, what could you do with them? If you can answer that, there's intrinsic value.

I shouldn't have thought the ad hominem was to cover up ignorance! Good points, thank you.
