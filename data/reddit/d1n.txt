yes. I tried to do my best (token, linux machine), but weak part was password and wallet backup in my mail.
I bough those BTC under 100$ and my whole fiat investment to BTC is already back, so those were just "money", which I can effort to loose. I never saw them or earn them by my daily job. Just numbers..
sadly, I'm not to first one or last one, who was hacked..
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:54:30
hmm, just check my mail acc again and it seems you are right with backups and bypass the 2FA
Successful authorization. (this is from BTC-E)
Login: XXXX
IP: 185.17.1.209
Date and time: 03.01.14 21:11
and this is not my IP. using hotmail and it seems, that there is not any IP history. Otherwise, backup of my wallet was stored here..
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:15:37
yes, on android (nexus 5, nonrooted) - latest application installed was widget for checking doge (
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:06:47
I'm little scared, that this will be issue for crypto in the future. Majority of people (me included), are not able 100% secure online accs. Because there is no authority, nobody can help you in any issue..not sure, if "be own bank" statement is advantage from any point of view..
@_date: 2014-01-04 03:05:54
it was just my stupidity, because I used the mail for couple various web services, not just for blockchain wallet.
point is, that my mail acc was hacked and there was still backup of blockchain wallet..in this case is linux laptop and token totally useless. now I know it..
@_date: 2014-01-03 22:47:59
thanks for link mate.
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:44:33
chars changed, but the format and amount of various symbols is same.
@_date: 2014-01-04 00:10:48
wihout 2FA, 8 char long password..yes, this was mistake, now I know.
@_date: 2014-01-04 04:00:19
love this crypto paradox. bitcoin is online currency, requires internet for any kind of operations but must be saved offline to make sure, that nobody hack it somehow..
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:16:00
nope, just one password and yubikey (I know, trying to answer every question)
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:24:50
first: just post this, I don't want to create own thread: 
second: indeed, just sent them a mail
@_date: 2014-01-03 20:19:26
btw this is from blockchain wallet IP access log:
Today 18:09:48	viewed login page	185.17.1.209	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0
now going to change passwords to the accs. mail from blockchain was months old (I clicked on emailing backup during wallet creation) and I forgot about it..
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:21:13
honestly, I don't care. I just want to warn others to prevent use of online storage, even you are using 2FA..nothing else.
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:36:45
no, I didn't receive any confirmation, just mail, that somebody initiated the transaction and notification to android app.
for me is hard to understand, how somebody could login to wallet, if is 2FA secured with hard token..
@_date: 2014-01-03 22:13:07
yes, it was word and numbers were instead of letters (3 - E, 1 - I, 0 - O)
now I know that it was stupid, but want to share it for help other guys prevent this situation. is hard to explain feeling, once somebody hack your accs and steal all BTC and you can't do anything..
@_date: 2014-01-04 00:08:05
thanks for beer.) now I'm quite fine (after couple of hours and beers), but initial feeling is really shitty..
@_date: 2014-05-21 14:57:39
what about squid?;)
@_date: 2014-01-03 20:44:06
ok, done
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:00:11
uhh yes, now I know..
I think, that hotmail is not supporting 2FA (GA, token), time to move to gmail.
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:38:49
it was unique set of 12 chars (numbers, special chars etc).
hmm, I expect, that token generate new set of symbols for every login..
@_date: 2014-02-26 08:23:10
can't downvote more.(
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:50:25
I know, that is hard to believe and understand to somebody, who is new to any crypto related community. I'm also very sceptical to noobs on bitcointalk..now I'm on other side here. 
thanks for your words. as I mentioned before, I start this post as a warning to others and share, what is possible in this sometimes great and sometimes cruel crypto world. this is not QQ topic or dogecoin propagation. Is so sad, that somebody think in this way..
@_date: 2014-01-04 00:17:35
and you bought back and you are now in again?
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:12:36
I didn't use GA but ubikey..(hard token)
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:08:18
huh thanks.) have got great GF and cool job, this is just another event in my life..
@_date: 2014-01-04 04:15:08
uhh really?.( post TX here..
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:10:41


yes. I come to reddit, because of dogecoin, but interested about cryptos from April (bitcointalk username: Xialla) otherwise, it is true, believe me or not..
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:03:21
I don't have any second password for blockchain wallet. just ID, password and line for ubikey token
@_date: 2014-01-03 20:29:57
nope, somebody (185.17.1.209) hacked my mail acc on hotmail and recovered wallet from blockchain backup..
@_date: 2014-02-26 08:26:00
some shitty web we for buying and selling currencies in online games with crypto. anyway, it is pointed for product, which is not exist.)
