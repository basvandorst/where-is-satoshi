May I ask how much you've taken out? Has it been for debts/expenses or have you HODL'd it all
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:19:39
I'll remember this moment, let's go!
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:11:39
Thank youu! I try to explain this all the time ����
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:11:28
Never count bitcoin out ����
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:22:04
Grand Exchange, in Cryptocurrency terms GDAX

All I'm saying is, the only loss you have is not investing in it. If you believe in it going to the moon, investing now shouldn't be considered a loss,
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:55:05
And to the people that purchased under $20k CAD yesterday in the "dip"! Let's fly high !
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:49:51
Always keep your head high!
@_date: 2017-02-24 04:25:44
Awesome, thank you!
@_date: 2017-02-24 04:23:20
Is there a planned time we should know that?
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:59:08
Yeah I am right now, thank you sir! I appreciate it!
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:05:54
Ahaha! Okay, I hope to figure that out, wanna diversify my portfolio����
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:53:15
Wow, that's crazy! The price would be locked in to when I decided to transfer though right?
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:45:31
I've found that I do not meet the minimum requirement to buy as well as I do not have the required ID, I'm pretty young
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:46:38
So, if I put them into a wallet, I now "control the keys"?
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:55:18
Oh that is great! 
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:46:54
Would you say a couple days? I'm transferring from my exchange to my wallet
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:40:43
Hmmmm, it's just very hard to get a grasp through how such a big corporation could go down like that
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:58:13
Well there's some places where I do not have to use ID, so at this point is where I'm trying to collectively bring together all of those to help out the younger audience, as we do not wanna wait 2-3 years when bitcoin is at 25k or so
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:56:11
If anyone can confirm this before I check it out it would be greatly appreciated // yeah man I don't think there is fees but I also feel like to make up for that they raise the price a lot
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:49:59
Alright, you've swung me into electrum, now just trying to get an estimate on how long it'll take to make my transaction
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:53:36
People tell me this but I live in a small town and there are no ATMS close to me, is there actual online purchases there?
@_date: 2017-08-31 06:48:21
16 y/o here as well man! We see the opportunities and we try to capitalize! Good luck to you! 
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:57:08
So if BTC was a certain amount and I decide to transfer over to my wallet. And let's say it takes 15 days to do, would the fees that I'm paying stay the same as when I transferred?
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:43:05
What do you mean by that?
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:49:47
Are the odds pretty strong that an exchange like this could fold? 
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:41:30
Oh okay, that makes so much sense, so then could I ask you the question on how much time should it take for a transaction to be completed? Does this depend on the fee I give and or the amount I need sent?
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:01:55
No this is all good! I just feel like when you purchase, they take a fee, when you sell, they take a fee, when you transfer from wallets they take a fee, in just trying to minimize the amount they take and do not know where to go! 
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:01:40
Awesome, thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:36:00
I will take 0.1, I'm not greedy at all ☺️
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:49:09
May you explain to me the bit about Trezor or Nano Ledger? Thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-30 05:06:08
Yeah honestly, that's the way I think I should go, if I go with gdax there is not one fee I pay
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:02:55
So is Electrum only a Bitcoin wallet? What would I use for other cryptocurrencies?
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:13:26
I'm pretty sure they are taking a percentage when I'm transferring from coinbase to electrum
@_date: 2017-09-03 05:18:25
We all feel the same way OP, but it's okay, you've learned what you know now and now you can make the decisions to succeed with the future in crypto! This is only the beginning!
@_date: 2017-09-06 22:50:13
So was this a seminar? I am creating a seminar for my high school class and I'm going to be talking about how cryptocurrency is changing the world. What kind of activities did you engage everyone in, if any? Thank you!
