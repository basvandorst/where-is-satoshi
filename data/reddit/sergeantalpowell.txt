1) Don't worry, we'll be just fine without you.
2) What if he had said 'enforce' instead of 'dictate', what difference do you imagine that would have made? 
In this context, the words are synonyms. And even if you don't understand how policing works, police are there to enforce the laws

It sounds like **you're** the one who's not familiar with the case. He was **live streaming** during a publication ban, risking a mistrial. If he actually cared about getting justice, more than grandstanding, he'd have shut up until the publication ban was lifted.

Weird how the prosecutor, the judge, and yaxley-lennon all acknowledged there was a risk of a mistrial then?
Do tell us more about how you're more educated on the matter than all the above.

When there's not a good reason, then no. When there's a good reason... like not causing a mistrial of alleged child rapists, then yes.
But you know, thats just me... Actually bothering to understand the issue. You do you.

Where did you get that all the cases were resolved?
You know, you could have done some actual reading on the issue, and not just from some "reporters" that you agree with, and found that **not all the cases were resolved**. That's why the publication ban was still in effect:

Would you go so far as to say, ["This means we'll never see prices below $6K for a very long time, if ever."](
(I'm joking (mostly), just making the point that future predictions are questionable)

Except owning a gun isn't keeping you safe, it's making you and your family less safe due to the far likelier event of an accidental discharge.

Every time you've bought something online you've benefited from fraud protection.
There is a herd immunity aspect. People wanting to sell online and not treat customers fairly will very quickly change or be forced out because of fraud protection. So everyone gets better service.
The free market *may* have a similar effect, but not as dramatic. (if a retailer sold a product cheaply, but screwed over a fairly minor percentage of customers, they might well succeed)

Why not? Court tells your employer to give x BTC to the person you owe money to instead of to you? What about BTC is different? 


Just because you get paid in cash and hide it, doesn't mean you're immune from the courts. You still have an employer/wages that can be garnished and/or physical assets that can be sold off.

Ah ok, thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:15:59
Oh that's true, sorry I missed that.

You didn't really answer his question. What was it you could do yourself that the bots couldn't do?

Why would contract law cease to function? Right now, if we sign a contract saying I am giving you 10 George Foreman grills (or dollars, but lets say grills) today, and a year from now you will give me 11 George Foreman grills, I can bring you to court if you don't give me the grills. 
Why would that not be the case with bitcoin? Why would the same enforcement of debt not apply? Right now (afaik) there are no organisations lending BTC, but with identity verification and signed contracts, why do you think there couldn't be?
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:25:40
Yeah, that's fair. I guess I would compare it to borrowing cash, and hiding is somewhere you know 100% nobody would ever find it/steal it. It doesn't mean you can get away with repaying, the lender could take your physical assets, or garnish wages. I don't see how BTC/other crypto would mean we would no longer have borrowing/lending.

Or you could just take a crowbar to the machine and take the notes? 
If you're going to defraud the company, why stop half way?

Not transfer crypto. To convert fiat.
You won't be able to buy $USD 100 or 200 worth of btc (... Say on localbitcoins) in one country, and sell it in another country without the two endpoints taking at least as much combined as western union would on the same transaction.
@_date: 2018-12-19 15:29:05
Think pipe dream.
In 40 years time, when we’re all still using fiat, I am sure Western Union will be happy they took the advice on here and got out of the lucrative fiat transfer business.
