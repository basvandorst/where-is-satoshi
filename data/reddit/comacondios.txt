Every shipment that goes through the postal service get's a stamp containing the date and post office where it was dispatched.
LE can place or intercept some orders, find out which post offices were used and look at camera footage to find the peep who dropped packages at those times, and talk with the clerks if they remember who dropped the packages.
Then they can try to stake out the post offices and drop boxes and wait for a similar looking peep. Or looking at archive footages of CCTV cameras in the city, they can follow the peep to his home or vehicle to get an address or a license plate.
If the vendor used a lot of drop points, multiple post offices and drop boxes, and used multiple disguises or associates to drop packages - so it would take a lot of manpower to stake out all those places - and it's not possible to pinpoint or profile the person who dropped the packages for some reason, then they can check which mobile phones were near the drop boxes at the time of dispatches and work with that. Or check every drop box at the end of the day to find the packages and use a dog to find the dispatcher. 
Or look for fingerprints or DNA on the inside of the packages.
 
If none of these help, they keep ordering and sooner or later a pattern will emerge that will make it possible to pinpoint someone who dropped the package, follow him to his home then to the drug lab or whatever.
It all comes down to LEO and how hard they are trying to get you.  
But it's still safer than dealing IRL.
