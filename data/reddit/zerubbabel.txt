I need clearification on 1 thing , the address that you need to give bitbuider to get the purcased gox btc is a mt gox address? when you withdraw?
Or can my blockchain address get the gox btc ?

i think he id buying all the cheap coins and selling on other sites, why would he fix the withdraw issue. He could be making way more money this way then fees on the exchange
