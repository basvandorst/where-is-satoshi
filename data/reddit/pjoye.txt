As he said as well, you can buy bitcoin at the ticket machines, but you can't buy tickets with it.

According to the page I've linked – they look very ambitious...  
They seem to be planning to organise several types of events and projects. Also, they offer to inform and help companies or merchants utilise Bitcoin.
Also I've noticed the prices mentioned in the article differ from the ones on their site.

Good job, will look into ordering. Nice pictures too - one of you is a photog right? (I mentioned you [here]( if you don't mind).
Just wondering about sizing, I doubt that it is a one-size-fits-all...

Thank you, and nice shots ;). Yesterday I placed my order for two pair and paid with Bitcoin. That went smooth. Hope that everything goes well and they will fit.

This is so awesome, only if shipping to Europe was possible.

That's the artists personal signature, a seal. It's not only used in art.

So... How much is it?

From [their site]( note the last sentance.


That means they accept bitcoin payments, and even encourage it.

Yes, I've used them a couple of times actually. Their primary language actually is Dutch, and that's the language in which I also view their site. I haven't noticed any errors.
The first time I've used them was back in 2014, and have since expanded their portfolio of coins. You do pay a small premium, and the delivery is not instant, but they have always delivered fairly quick. Even for larger amounts.
There's actually some more errors I've noticed in your image.
