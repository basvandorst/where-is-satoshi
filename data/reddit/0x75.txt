Just so you know, shorting is an art. 
You need to guess two times:
1- You need to be right in your assumption. You need to guess the direction.
2- More important, you need to guess WHEN. If you do not guess the right timing you are making the same mistake as if you were wrong assuming an asset will increase or decrease its value.
So, there is no point in shorting btc *right now* regardless of what you think. Or else, you may be making a mistake even if it actually drops to $1 next month.
Unless you have A LOT of money to stand your ground with many margin calls and you end up being correct in your assumption.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:45:43
You have to send all your personal details to exchanges, and the only people that truly makes uses of such "I don´t care about the government capabilities" are criminals or people doing money laundering.
Cut that shit.
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:17:02
that´s a classic "you don´t understand Bitcoin". Not like anyone needs to be a Doctor in economics to purchase stuff and use the dollar, or Paypal.
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:40:09
So if Bitcoin needs so much propaganda maybe it means the technology it uses *as a currency* is not that great? not to behave like the "world currency" not as a "store of value" as it can be forked forever.
They use the blockchain and they are based in the Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash is a name like any other. Plus no one owns the brand Bitcoin.
(well except for its creator of course)
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:26:45
no one ?

40K Bitcoin, xD I am sure he is into bitcoin for the freedom,etc. 
Early miner I guess.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:02:41
Oh, really ? news at 11.
It has been inflated via a) false volume, fabricated b) propaganda and marketing (no complains though) c) scams d) hype
Otherwise you would not have dozens of other crypto currencies also pumped.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:20:48
then HODL. Ah, it is stupid to just HODL while others ride the wave anyway.
Also your point 1 is clearly underestimating the consequences. Was not all this about trust ?
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:36:27
For how long ? also, I can see this read in this sub as *"in Japan salaries are paid with Bitcoin, it is everywhere"* which it is far from reality.
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:55:16
No. Not the same dude. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:11:03
except all your personal information, etc.
@_date: 2018-01-26 11:51:55
Yeah, promises like SpaceX... 
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:59:18
RISC-V, but anyway, who is going to do that ? and how are you going to pay that people ? 
It is not the same doing a wallet or some segwit compared to a CPU architecture. Plus, most people here is only for the profit from trading or mining.
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:00:26
So as you can see... that would not be enough. And I am sorry of reading that actually happened.
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:36:23
Maybe, I just posted it for the debate nothing more nothing less.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:03:38
to the OP, so, what can you use your Bitcoin for other than trading it  ? realistically speaking.
(Drug dealers and criminals, people that do money laundry do not reply)
@_date: 2018-01-28 03:45:12
or paypal, contactless payments, etc. And cut that shit, what they do provides them lot of money already.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:09:49
Compared to wait hours or days for sure it is fast. Welcome to 20 years ago.
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:03:55
sure nothing is an argument if it does not fit your confirmation bias.
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:34:17
Translation: "my blockchain is better" sort of argument, even though they are pretty much clones.
The same with many altcoins. So are cryptocurrencies good or just the one you own ?
@_date: 2018-01-25 22:03:43
So you don't care paying 5000k for a coffee. Sorry, meant 200€, I mean 10€.
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:20:55
Same shit.
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:46:09
well from like 700 to 7000 in months... it is not bad. From a trading perspective.
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:02:25






@_date: 2018-01-04 04:37:06
How about no ?
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:05:29
Much WOW, still you can´t do anything with Bitcoin, and even with LN I do not know what you expect, like people burning their wallets and getting into Bitcoin ?
No, people already have PayPal, bank transfers and stable currencies (to a point) and they do not care as much about the banksters... people is more worried about the next iPhone than Bitcoin.
That is people that has money, most people just do not earn that much to be worried about crypto trading.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:41:11
This is advertisement or what ?
"got rich with bitcoin, get yours now!"
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:12:48
Except this news are bullshit, it is only two companies **not** countries and probably they did not even use Bitcoin. But the link is not in english...
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:57:07
Yeah, and what about personal information, etc.
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:56:44
Well, the HODLERS wanna sell but at higher price, the traders that win the market on the volatility are making loads of money on weak hands but also HODLERS.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:53:03
Sorry, looking for confirmation bias? Maybe personal attacks?
If you read me, I am not against nor in favour of Bitcoin or any other altcoin. Blockchain is cool, Bitcoin is a very good idea... but it is far from the revolution and 'freedom' everyone claims it is.
Of course, with a lambo Bitcoin is all fine.
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:33:06
Amazing, but still, first thoughts were to exchange for USD. 
Not sure that makes sense with all the propaganda re: "In Japan everyone uses Bitcoin"
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:14:15
Those plans with caps are an aberration,  I do not know how people can tolerate such a scam.
Internet should be unlimited data always, 21st Century onwards.
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:35:03
MT GOX.
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:54:54
"the rest of the world", no one gives a fuck. They are more interested in the new iPhone and how much it costs in Dollars.
The only reason people knows bitcoins is cause, "that thing increased value by a lot, you can be rich fast".
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:16:41
*Will Zero-Fee Crypto Trading be the norm?*
No. People wants to make profit, and for that reason you have also miners. Then there is propaganda about freedom and what not.
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:35:18
It is, but still, no one else other than companies and some people uses it. To be fair.
Still has a lot of potential for general users, but maybe other systems and not Linux will take over.
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:03:51
Price Manipulation in the Bitcoin Ecosystem
Most people is in Bitcoin for profit. Not saying Bitcoin is bad or anything but at the moment - as a currency - it is useless.
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:11:43
So Bitcoin is anonymous or not ? like WTF.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:23:12
Came to write exactly that in quotes. You are way too fast.
edit: even though you posted like 9h ago.
@_date: 2018-01-25 22:05:11
No,that is not how it works. And trading crypto is not like holding nasdaq or qqqq or something like that.
By no means. Don't compare Intel, Tesla or whatever with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:21:30
Sure, but are you purchasing goods with Bitcoin or just worrying about its price (in dollars), so you end up posting in reddit ?
Not sure you realize yourself of the flaw.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:55:17
And... highly exaggerated. At most, companies traded, NOT COUNTRIES.
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:18:18
Every day another post about  LN and how many nodes no one uses are out there.
@_date: 2018-01-28 04:12:05
I thought Bitcoin was meant to be a replacement for regular fiat money, so a CURRENCY for every day, just like fiat but using the blockchain.
Not like gold, it *cannot* simply be both, gold and your money to pay coffee. So, basically, if everyone agrees your "gold" from any video game could have the very same value as bitcoin, using or not the blockchain, does not even matter.
@_date: 2018-01-25 01:16:47
HODL, let traders get the money from arbitrage and volatility.
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:55:06
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:37:10
But it should increase now that everyone is using Bitcoin to pay everything specially in Japan no ?
I mean, lightning network is so fast and fees are near 0, so... one should be paying everything in Bitcoin now.
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:37:15
Maybe, I just posted it for the debate nothing more nothing less.
@_date: 2018-01-05 08:38:58
So what? the CDO, mortgages  and amount of Houses Sold in 2000-2008 also increased.
As you may know by now, also those investments "could not be undone". 
@_date: 2018-01-25 01:18:09
700$ would be proper warning, and maybe a purchase opportunity. But it can reach 1.000.000$ it depends on how much propaganda and bullshit about bitcoin one can release to the media.
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:13:04
Asking to pay with something that is meant to act like gold "by the face".
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:24:08
It is more profit, and information is power.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:03:27
Except Trump won in the US.
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:00:30
The propaganda is here! Keep pumping!
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:46:58
Except it is a bit more complicated than that, because some people entered the market TOO LATE, others do not want to pay taxes or they do not know how to avoid paying taxes, etc.
Of course, others think it will end up increasing its value so they hold.
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:41:23
You do care, you know Bitcoin Cash is a fork, so there is nothing more to it. You should not care.
@_date: 2018-01-26 11:50:55
Do not underestimate fear.
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:41:54
And so Etherum did, and most certainly Bitcoin in its early stages.
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:42:07
But no one uses them because everyone is HODLING.
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:35:12
Are you all spending your bitcoins like if there is no tomorrow finally ?
@_date: 2018-01-28 03:21:01
Yeah, when you are rich you normally get more money. The regular people... well, the mine.
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:33:02
Well, you can actually duplicate the technology. And you also have alt-coins.
Also, you can shit in a pot, and that shit is pretty much unique. 
Even Magic Cards with a serial number cannot be duplicated as long as you verify the serial online and some crypto if you want.
Meh, sounds like propaganda to me. Regardless of the fact that Blockchain is a very cool concept.
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:34:14
It is unless a dystopia scenario in which case bitcoin will not matter either. You have proof of payments, transfers, etc.
And you can access it, your bitcoin can be also seized by military force. You may hide your coins for a while at most.
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:39:43
there is no need. For the "currency of the world" that´s a low number, plus, no one actually uses them on live to pay anything.
people is still trading and making GPUs cost 2x.
(which does not mean it cannot be 10x in few weeks or that the effort the developers put is futile, but still, not amazing)
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:41:38

@_date: 2018-01-24 21:11:44
As always, Bitcoin marketing and propaganda.
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:35:27
like how many bitcoin millionaires exactly ?
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:33:28
"nobody controls it", however, you can see in constant fights re: segwit, people implementing LN, etc.
So for no one controlling it we have a lot of "influencers" doing marketing and developers implementing stuff, forks when someone disagrees, etc.
Not like the average people will ever be worried about those things so yes, there is SOMEONE controlling cryptocurrencies directly or indirectly.
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:38:02
or 10K or 200K depending on when.
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:55:03
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:31:33
So then, do we use Bitcoins or do we HODL them like gold?
And do not say "both" that´s non-sense. Unless you want to take profit over other people.
@_date: 2018-01-28 04:04:25
There is also the fact many people will not pay taxes from bitcoin gains, which if later on have to paid can be a risk (indirect) for the bank.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:08:49
Is not Bitcoin the money that NO BANK or Government can manipulate ? I do not understand the complains now.
Bitcoin make you free, rich too. So, if it belongs to no one I do not know what regulations you think it should have.
Exchanges... they do have legal responsibilities and manage personal information so they HAVE TO be regulated, but cryptocurrencies... that trade 24x7...
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:47:06
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:34:53
I do not know, maybe Monero is better cause it is more anonymous or maybe Etherum can take over despite being a freaking scam thanks to its smart contracts.
Maybe a new coin appears and it is better than Bitcoin, should be possible for a new coin to appear learning from the mistakes of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:37:57
cool, that is what I wanted to confirm.
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:35:27
No, so if you say that you respect forks and that you do not care then do not go rampage against BCash and other altcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:25:35
Sure now explain that to someone that the only thing wants to do is going to buy some bread and return to whatever that person does.
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:44:50

I guess they want the commission, for them is another business they don´t care how the money flows in. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:10:27
Or not.
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:55:08
Sure if EVERYONE puts a little of money there is going to GROW exponentially. For a while, when people cashes in.
Some will win the trading, someone elses will lose it.
@_date: 2018-01-28 04:06:43
Sure cause everyone is paying using bitcoins and crypto and not saying "HODL", if you hold your money then what do you use ?*
*DOLLARS, EURO, ETC.
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:52:29
I am sure you would be holding if it was worth it 1 btc 1€ now.
Look, I am not trying to indoctrinate anyone, but other 'digital gold' exists. And you can clone Bitcoin when there is none.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:56:39
I think the OP meant, "you can´t a afford a Whole Bitcoin now" but the ones who mine or early adopted... NEED YOU, for pumping the coin !
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:06:57
True !
@_date: 2018-01-26 11:53:20
No, we have crypto because of an experiment arou nd a nice idea, the blockchain.

@_date: 2018-01-24 14:02:58
Well, this "caps" things are something in UK and US in many eu countries it would be an insult.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:57:28
**and you paid in dollars**
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:54:43
Anyway, I got your point. But this is exaggerated news regardless.
Like "Japan legalizes bitcoin" or "People pay houses with bitcoin" associated to "bitcoin is now everywhere and no one uses traditional fiat anymore GET IN NOW"
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:39:15


Sure. If the article was saying "Japan uses Bitcoin" it would not be clickbait.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:42:46

I am not sure what you think it is needed to setup a node dude, it is like creating your website or contracting a hosting and deploying a service there. Not much complicated if you have technical skills.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:28:23
It was not a disagreement, but saying the volume is what it is for several reasons.
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:54:16
Bitcoin is to purchase stuff, the blockchain can be whatever.
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:05:47
cause your knowledge of security is so awesome that your computer and your wallet was protected against malware, Spectre, Meltdown and other vulns you do not know nothing about.
However, those guys that MUST enforce security, still got hacked. 
What do you think the average person using a vulnerable android device or Windows can do against threats like that ?
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:54:43
jaja unlike people no ?
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:04:42
(no need to say it is an opinion, and I am personally not against nor in favour)
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:52:18
Did you ask the same about Bitcoin ? is it the new gold ? does everyone want it ? maybe, maybe not.
What people wants from Bitcoin is to cash in or hold in hope it increases its price by a 400%.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:32:00


? then you create the Bitcoin Extension chain which has more blockspace, so you can give more blocks of the Block Chain.
Same like when you have two currencies, dollar and canadian dollars I guess. And problem solved, now the supply can grow without limits. Or you can use any of the other alt-coins.
Remember: Bitcoins is *still* not gold.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:36:36
doing what ? buying stuff on Steam with Litecoin or Dash ? 
No one is doing anything with cryptocurrencies, just trading and getting fiat in exchange for the (successful) gamble.

@_date: 2017-12-06 14:37:32
Yeah you will need a lot of them when bread costs you 10 BTC cause "you can pay".
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:36:10
*is like arguing the US Treasury is unsecure because your credit card info can be stolen.*
No it is not. I call bullshit.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:52:34
It worked for Google though. However, your example is stupid, has 0 analogy in this case.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:28:37
HAHAHAHAH "to make money" I thought it was about freedom,etc.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:46:19
HAHAHAHAHHAHA sure sure mate.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:06:42
You know bitcoin and the blockchain is like your bank, that people is stealing you all the time. Is not the consensus argument about this matter? ( + "you dont understand bitcoin" + "it makes you free from the banks". )
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:26:57
More marketing ? so this makes it closer to paypal, wire transfers or what ? xD
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:14:17
Plenty of kids starting mining Bitcoins where it was worth shit (well, this is still arguable) and hoarded hundreds.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:23:03
You mean indoctrinate to make sure tbis is pumped while everyone HODLS hoarding their bitcoins?
Mining and keeping the bitcoins when their price was a few dollars (he trusts in thia no?) was enough to have hundreds pf bitcoins today.
So... He is rich thanks to people, which ia good but cannot buy shit unless he cashes in the old fashion fiat.
But I find despicable laughing at someone for not being rich so happy about that.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:49:14
You are bitcoin rich and you wish you could pay everything in dollars prices but using Bitcoin instead directly ? Are you tired of high taxes on your Bitcoins ? 
You wanna avoid paying taxes exchanging your bitcoins but you cannot use them in the real world ? 
Invest in Bitcoin marketing and keep pumping it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:37:24
2 makes no sense if you all accrue BTC to HODL. 1, is rather stupid and irrational... and 3... I thought bitcoin was about freedom and what not... you seem all focused about making money, profits and do what the banksters do.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:02:09
It is not EXACTLY the same argument you gave?
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:30:17


Sure, and infinite resources for you to use all your bitcoins. And it will only keep growing same as the world economies, dollar and the like... cause yeah, the Blockchains is magic.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:34:09
Yeah, so use them.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:56:02
I know it is by design, what I am telling you *dumbass* is that that "scarcity" limit is not as strong in a world where dollar and euro are no more. When people are looking and fighting for something hard to get, then we will see about your fucking consensus.
- The quantity of a rare metal or gold is limited, creating more if possible at all is very expensive. Or impossible if a meteor full of gold does not hit Earth.
- The Blockspace in the Blockchain as an asset (aka Bitcoin) is limited but you can create as many as you want. If fact, when you fork a coin that "money" exists in both chains and you created money... sure it will later drop value or whatever but works enough for the example.
You can create other alt-coins, you can clone bitcoin. You can have more blockspace, unlike, gold or a physical asset that you cannot clone or replicate.
And please there is no need to insult those not confirming your bias, I am not in favour nor against bitcoin or any other alt-coin and I do think the Blockchain as a technology is very good.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:41:51
Who cares if it is "user friendly" in the future?  Have you seen someone rejecting a bill note cause it is not user friendly? or having issues paying by card or getting money from an ATM ? Or paying Steam games with Paypal ?
It has to have A BENEFIT over another currency, today, is the massive speculation and the "fun" of trading something that for now goes up all the time. People is thrilled getting money (dollars, euros) with no effort via Bitcoin. But no one needs to use Bitcoin other than drug dealers or those who want to avoid paying taxes, it is cool, but not a must have.
As per today, Bitcoin is just useless and complicated to use, plus easier to stole in big quantities via malware, hacks, or scams.
Blockchain is cool, though. But as a general concept is not even like re-using rockets (SpaceX).
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:11:40
Back then Bitcoin was not worth it 17k, stop the non-sense examples.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:35:07
Another advice: do not spend your bitcoin in cocaine.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:04:21
Like when a crypto exchange gets money stolen or they steal the money and go away ? just that you cannot anything because it is not regulated.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:50:42


And that is bullshit.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:31:43
First is "how to invest to get rich fast" then there is "lambos" and "avoid paying taxes in exchange"
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:50:31
and in that moment, you realize that the goods you use to purchase had a massive inflation and now what it used to cost you 10$ costs you 400$.
Welcome to the same shit you are used to, but anonymous, and less controlled (hopefully) by third parties. Ideal for money laundry, drugs and crime scene in general, though (and sadly that is a fact).
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:42:46
So Bitcoin is cause "no banks control nothing" but seems we are all having the same issues xD
Except sure, "no govt". So govt will not be able to do much.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:34:48
By "fix" you mean pump the coin ?
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:20:47
Which was exactly my point. Re-read my comment.
You tried to apply a past example into a current scenario. Like if circumstances were similar.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:51:53
Was it better to say they were broke and cause panic ? more, I mean.
It was up to everyone figure out if the hipster exchange is reliable or not. Same with Kraken or whatever.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:30:04
I call bullshit, what people want is to get rich. FAST.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:34:54
DO NOT PANIC, make sure others hoarding bitcoins can get out and be rich with less risk. Remember all this is a about indoctrinating others to buy and use their bitcoins - so confidence grows - while you HODL your bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:21:11
"How **marketing** is used to Manipulate Cryptocurrency Markets" 
Keep pumping.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:53:47
Bullshit, you only want the money from either bcash or bitcoin, and you want to cash in in dollars probably. And, without paying taxes when possible.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:20:35
sorry about that, reddit was mis-behaving... the reply was not appearing so I was not sure it was posted or what. I even deleted once, because it appeared twice...

Nor he gives a damn fuck, he is already rich and needs no money for a house or a student loan.
What it is pathetic, is that "investing" in Bitcoin yields more in a week than Google, Testa and SpaceX together in years.

Sure sure, that is why you spend your bitcoins today right ? cause you do not care if it goes up correct ?
 (unless you already got a x10 in your balance... then you sell to make sure you materialize the gains).

Bitcoin is trading and speculation, it is code. And code, often, gets obsolete and forgotten in most cases. Of course, new versions will appear.
And yes, the blockchain is cool, etc. But let's not overreact.

@_date: 2017-12-21 16:50:08
In top of that, you got scammed, cause spending with a currency that that goes from 700$ to 17.000$ *in few months* is not a good purchase.

this is a correction

Blockchain is a nice concept, same as p2p. However call it "this beautiful thing" like if it is doing anything for society at all other than consuming electricity and allow some people to get rich fast in dollars or euros...
SpaceX does more, Tesla as well and Microsoft even. Bitcoin... does NOTHING, and it has clones, which are other altcoins.
Bitcoin is trading and speculation.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:28:29
Until it does not, then what ?
(Can you not say the same for any other cryptocurrency at the moment ?)
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:54:00
Exactly, that is people HODL. Not paying taxes, and keep pumping so Bitcoin get mainstream and they can use it like if they were dollars just withouy an exchange.
But I see no reason for keeping prices to their match in USD.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:16:11
something does not add up there.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:33:13
Did you pay taxes ?
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:36:04
I was looking into this at like few dollars, then later at like 700$ xD
But then you look at Dash, Etherum and so on... 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:04:32
I got your point before, just had to make the critic comment.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:59:55
Aaaaannnnddd .... this is propaganda. People can do what they want. If Bitcoin can be attacked then that is a concern, however, anyone can attack any coin.
If this is a problem to rise, then, Bitcoin has issues. Otherwise you should be able to ignore attacks that are not meant to succeed because the blockchain is awesome,etc.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:02:30
It is all about marketing with Bitcoin, to keep pumping.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:38:14
What for ? to make it look like it is more like your regular stock ? Maybe a reverse-split then.
Is it for fooling people on how inflated the value is at the moment compared to a month ago ?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:55:02
Of course not, people is trying that others "pump dollars" into it and that all the other curriencies converge into Bitcoin. You can always buy (or mine) in the magic world of Bitcoin where it can only grow in value.
Funny thing we always complain about the system and the fiat current and the modern banking system but at the first chance.... we come back to "basic economics". Fuck that shit.
Bitcoins wants to a) replace gold b) be the common fiat currency that everyone uses and making society free and what not. However, if there are no other currencies whatsoever then what would be the value of 1 Bitcoin ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:32:22
Or a lambo.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:45:02
Tell me, how Bitcoin will be stablished if you can´t do shit with it and everyone who gets Bitcoins or any other cryptocurrency is hoarding them.
If you cannot use Bitcoin only that for trading it will never be stablished and used by the masses because no one is that stupid to pay with something that will x10 x20 its value in few weeks.
Also hard for trading when volality is so high, and it does not even work as a Paypal replacement (for now) because of high transaction fees.
The bullshit news about "Japan makes Bitcoin official" "This other country now embraces bitcoin" and that shit... is just plain MARKETING, I will not say is a lie but...


You cannot even use it in steam, and also wants to be a replacement for gold, I doubt it can be both things at the same time.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:25:07
It was mostly  a game back then, but after some marketing and drug money, etc. It increased in value, and then everyone jumped in speculating.
Then yeah, at that point it is an investment vehicle mixed with gambling.
There was **NO RISK** early. Because you could mine with virtually no effort. Not sure what the fuck are you talking about.
Even some people just mine it while they pay cheap electricity, they buy hardware, that they can even sell later on. Not like they risk their money investing in a company or venture capital.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:28:50
*NEVER PANIC* there is other people that needs to get out first.
Remember everyone uses bitcoin, specially in Japan,etc. Even if you can´t do shit with Bitcoin in the real world the currency is backed up but the drug dealers, etc. So it is all fine.
Also there is this thing... the Lightning Bullshit, that will bring more bullshit faster than ever and Bitcoin will look more that your regular bank just you will need to buy a book to understand how to use your money.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:28:29
Bitcoin can't replace shit today.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:50:05
He should just 'count lambos'.
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:04:05
Well, they show that there is not scarcity in the "blockspace" asset world. Aka, blockchains are not scarce, so to succeed you must use them and people has to trust it.
But, with Bitcoin you cannot do shit, nowadays. Other than speculating of course. Fortunately, some people has donated Bitcoins for good causes which is at least... something important.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:46:02
LOL and then you guys talk about the Banks and Goverment manipulation, etc.
Bitcoin is Freedom and Love.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:43:22
You paid in bitcoins or did you enslaved yourself paying by the impure old traditional fiat money named dollar ?
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:49:49
As long as this keeps going up everyone will accept Bitcoins. Of course, if you can get 10x the value in few months ?!
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:18:27
holding is not always good, not if what you purchased are tulips.
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:47:24
Well, sure if you are rich already that does not bother you as much, but still "since you can pay" you will be forced to pay more.
But that is not the discussion here, we are not talking about particular individuals.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:20:10
They are Bitcoins. Not tulips, many are gambling here... I´d say.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:36:34
Is not that simple, but if that gives you confidence... I suggest you to take care with your investments.

Good for the overall crime scene. Also, it looks more like a traditional bank too.
I thought Bitcoin would make you free and ALL was reflected on the mighty Blockchain, super transparent, and already anonymous.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:13:47
I know I know, I get it... you are overthinking it, I know all that you are saying. Yes.
What I am presenting you is another point of view / example / reasoning.
There is no reason why that consensus is broken in the future, anytime, in favour of the alt-coin that you hate the most or the ugliest bitcoin clone they release in the future. With or without crypto protecting Bitcoin. It is a matter of choice, in the end... if that is not the case then Bitcoin is doomed (because yeah, dollars).
But again, what I was talking was about the blockspace blocks as an asset compared to gold, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:32:03


Aka, "some propaganda" and free marketing.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:33:31
Yeah cause Bitcoin has no internal absurdities, ... since the Blockchain is perfect. 
Bitcoin unlike the other coins and alt-coins will keep rising in value forever, everyone can be reach given enough time.
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:07:14
process namespace isolation, resource control, self-builds. So you do no need to know how to setup it, just run it.

But there is no blood yet.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:29:04
When you hodl, you are speculating. In case you doubt, is not like your money is used to build rockets by SpaceX or anything.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:55:13
Yeah maybe the people that has not money to "invest" cannot invest.
But now you could apply the same to the FOREX or to the regular stock market. Mostly no one invests, except for some people who either have money or know what they are doing compared to most people who does not care and see investing in stock a "scam".
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:15:46
And random propaganda in Reddit for free.
You got a pack of rice worth it somr satoshis, now a week or two of HODL later it cost you 200times more.
You could have paid that rice pack for 1$, no shit in between, and you can buy 10 packs from home using Paypal with no transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:21:27
Let me rephrase so it is more clear. Those transactions would never happen if you knew it would grow 1700%.
Let alone the fees.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:43:51
A drop to 16.5 when months ago it was at 700$ is NOTHING.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:30:36
I thought millennials were more about being against the 1%,etc. More than being rich fast.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:03:38


Well, yes, you are right. I meant to start a new chain from scratch using the same technology as Bitcoin which is not exactly the same as cloning Bitcoin.
I give you this point.


Well, I hope that line of code is not written in Perl, but sounds interesting. Did not hear about that.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:51:37
*If Bitcoin was not an open source*
But it is, stop complaining about forks, you may like it or not but do not talk about freedom and liberating societies with Bitcoin and then bother about someone forking code.
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:44:18
No, because people has ownership of companies, also not everyone trusts bitcoin. Also, other altcoins exist, etc.
And because, as per today, you barely can do anything with Bitcoins-other than exchanging it for dollars or euros with benefit (if you traded well).
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:07:32
Remember guys, this is the way to do things in life, no effort, just gamble and bet to get millionaire quick.
Work, research... that is for losers. Just mine a bit get super rich and be super happy investing in things that are worth it sponsoring Bitcoin to ensure more propaganda and keep your wealth growing with the cryptocurrencies.
For your kids, make them ask what currencies their professors buy.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:26:31

@_date: 2017-12-20 00:37:41

a) bullshit b) Sure, but they do not increase the price of your AMD GPU.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:06:18
There are  simple reasons:
The value of Bitcoin is based on trust, pretty much. Assuming the underlying technology is sound, of course.
Therefore, marketing helps Bitcoin but also affects Bitcoin, this time, marketing played a role against.
That and the fact that there are other players manipulating the market of *all* cryptocurrencies one way or another.
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:01:14


And that is why you post in reddit, looking for confirmation bias.
Dude, you are trading, it is fine. So far in one year people has been pumping it like in madness, what can go wrong ?
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:35:19
So keep up with your propaganda.

docker sucks in reality. And the technology for Linux containers was enabled in the Linux Kernel.
Google has been using containers since long before Docker.


No. The main functionality are the below, which provides all the security and encapsulation benefits:
* cgroups
* namespaces
* overlay fs (UnionFS)
You need kernel 3.10 or above to be able to use Docker.
Then Docker itself puts a layer in top of that, to be able to generate and maintain containers in a better way, it is by no means a "dependency control" system.

I did **not upload** anything and as far as I remember, I forcefully closed my account, in hope my scanned doc would be eliminated or not kept much longer.
MONTHS LATER, they email me when Bitcoin was rushing up saying that "congratulations" your account has been verified and fully activated.
The rest, you can think by yourself.

As long as you can do marketing those will have no problems.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:50:20
the new meta is "bitcoin is a safe haven" "store of value" not to buy cheap stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:52:02
Except for Bitcoin, it does. If there was actually 1 coin, its value would be higher for sure but at what cost ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:46:51
Nothing, it is how easy for some people is to make it and what you do with it that matters.
In short, equality and *how* do you make yourself rich compared to other people.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:43:41
yeap, the problem is that everyone is comparing this against dollar all the time. And checking their wealth in dollars based on the BTC the have.
And if BTC is so good that it will never disappear nor stop growing, I do not see any reason for other alt-coins to disappear since they use the very same magic underlying technology (blockchain).
Most people is into bitcoins to INVEST, speculate and HODL, but at the end of the day... everyone has its own ledger in a small notebook where it has the amount of awesome dollars they gained.
And then, they know what they can purchase with those dollars, because with Bitcoin, as per today, you can't do shit.
In the future though, who knows.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:46:33
Which you paid in *US DOLLARS.*
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:31:08
"He's worried that Bitcoin will become so valuable that it will render his USD retirement fund obsolete."
Sure cause there are not alt-coins, or gold or other stuff out there, it is everything Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is now about indoctrinating others to pump money in while "hodling" Bitcoins. But everyone keeps a notepad where they count their gains in dollar / euros.
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:49:47
Something that is STORE OF VALUE *cannot* behave like the regular fiat money that EVERYONE uses. It is just not compatible, unless I am mistaken and someone can argue otherwise.
Gold cannot be used today as a currency and still be gold as store of value. Also normally this "store of value" is for inflationary scenarios where money loses value but your assets retain it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:45:12
Of course, Bitcoin is about business.
You do not trust your banks with all regulations but you trust all your private data to random hipster companies that take a week to reply to an email. I am not sure what people expect.
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:44:22
Of course not, but definitively not with a "public all purpose" gambling either.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:32:56


I may overall agree or not, but ... that analogy is just wrong, sorry. It does not compute.

Bitcoin is for porn?
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:26:56

@_date: 2017-12-11 10:32:54
Many people purchased Bitcoins and altcoins on margin in random exchanges, but it is easy to do that when it always goes up.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:04:23
I hope they preserve it in some optical storage because otherwise first EMP or solar flare and it is gone.
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:06:09
Yeah but other issues appear. Docker is not a way to solve dependencies.
Nor will resolve team dependency issues if everyone uses docker alone.
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:21:38
So in a world in chaos, where euro and dollar are worth nothing and just a few selected superior people have Bitcoin... how are you going to use your Bitcoin to purchase goods ? Next time you go to the supermarket you will see "Bread, 20 BTC", problem solved.
That, or... "The1%Coin" for those that could not buy Bitcoin back in the day "join the crowd", if more people believes in a different "alternative coin" that would rise and Bitcoin would drop in value.
Either way, you are still evaluating your Bitcoin gains in dollars not in "things I can buy" with Bitcoins we cause still the real world use of Bitcoins is marginal.
In fact, you are still saying "invest" rather than "buy" like... get on board, this will never stop.

So now when a different cryptocurrency blockchain-based is preferred or when an altcoin rises in value versus Bitcoin is "an attack".
I thought Bitcoin was opensource, and not imposed by anyone. Nor necessarily has to be the "correct" cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:20:07
Yeah cause you know, "you do not understand bitcoin" but if you do, it also comes with a master in all economics, so if you know bitcoin you know everything about trading, synthetic assets, basic economics, and so on.

It would be possible, if everyone wanted. And we removed the need to buy things to live.

In a world like this one today, it is fairly impossible
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:54:34


I mostly disagree, the line where *it has to be* within A COIN is arguable. We can literally clone Bitcoin, no another altcoin, just another chain and agree that both are the same coin just... two chains.
But I got your point, and it is a fair one. However, the scarcity of Bitcoin blocks is not exactly the same as Gold, Silver or any other metal. Sure thing a meteor can impact Earth full of diamonds and change the supply so prices drop but...
In fact, you could make it so "the valid agreed" chains are hidden in a layer and it is transparent to users. Some random thoughts I know.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:42:12
Ein? I do not think there is time for a currency to be right or wrong. A currency has to serve a purpose, nothing else. And it has to be clear.

I agree with you, just not completely. And whereas any of us is saying anything incorrect... I cannot really tell.
Let's say I was making an observation.
And this is another comment now:


The "asset" here is a block within a Blockchain. But that is not truly scarce since you can clone Bitcoin (or create another altcoin) and then you have more blocks available. The blockspace asset is not limited.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:55:10

So now that we are all about saying the first stupid thing ... what happens when there is no fucking oil to buy and sell?
Can you not foresee any problem by the fact you cannot "print" more Bitcoins ? what about gold ? what about the fact that you can create more blockchain blocks by issuing a new cryptocurrency based on Bitcoin ? (but you can't simply create infinite gold or alternative gold ).
I get the point re: supply and demand sure, but for now everyone is HODL, cause yeah... why pay with something that will be worth it millions.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:04:35
If I shit in a box, for that piece there is limited supply. Unless of course, you decide to create an altshit.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:51:26
You can do futures of shit, if you wanted.

Yeah, but I was trying to infer other properties to it, which are agreed by the users themselves. So I was not referring to a fork, however, from the technical point of view... yes it is a fork.

Sure, do not complain next time there is an increase in rent price or house market in general.
Something that goes from 700$ to 17.000$ in few months, that has no real use in real world (not yet)... we call it "price discovery" now.

That is cool, but stupid. It is easy to do when it has no value but at 10k no fucking way he would do that lighty.

So who cares about the rest ? Bitcoin is to make you rich, sorry, free.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:42:46

Same as Steam. As long as it goes up EVERYONE wants bitcoins.
Howe many people here would buy stuff using Bitcoin today when they can use their "old" Dollars ? no one. If it costs more than 10€ worth of bitcoin everyone HODLS or sells for "the other" fiat currency.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:24:08
Sure, that is why everyone is paying cars and houses in bitcoins... too free people... And minining is to stop the climate change.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:40:54
Paypal or any similar service without Blockchain could do that, as long as it could protect identities, then it would be better.
Also what is the obession with "devs" and "blockstream" is not meant to be the money of everyone that no one controls and that no one has anything to say about more than any other ? Opensource, so you can use it and that is all. 
It turns out there are lot of miners, fees, developers and exchanges taking control. Let alone complexities around using it.

@_date: 2017-12-20 16:13:54
I said that because everyone shares this message about Bitcoin not being about getting money fast and speculation, complaining about banks, talking about freedom, etc.
but they are as well...:
- Trading. Often, with leverage.
- Sending all their data to hipster exchanges. Some even hacked.
- Not using the coins at all just HODLing them.
- Calculating their value using "old" fiat money like the dollar or the euro.
- Complaining when others do not follow the general line or those against Bitcoin because "they do not know bitcoin" or any other ad-hominem. As well as saying that altcoins are trash.
- Everyone posts memes about "lambos".
In relation to the rest of your questions, no, I do not get paid and I am not against or in favour of any particular cryptocurrency. And the reason for my previous message was just to highlight the irony.

Sure, just keep repeating that to yourself until you believe it.
Meanwhile, you have a notebook with your gains in dollars and several exchange tabs with EUR-BTC and BTC-USD prices in a 24h chart.

No, it does. It does matter and it is not fine dude.
"What matters is that anyone in the world can get some bitcoin and buy that book"

Do you even know people has been trading on the stock market FOR YEARS, there are BOOKS written about it.

I call **bullshit**, most likely they allow some employee to be paid in Bitcoins if they want, but first, exchanging the amount they normally earn into Bitcoins... not being paid the same amount of Bitcoins per month. Which is not the same.
Also, this is just more marketing I am sure, that makes no sense with an insane volatility. Unless they got LOADS of Bitcoins when they were worth it &lt; 100$.

I don't get people calling an asset that is equal or better than a bitcoin (from tech pov) "altcoin". It is like calling anything is notba dollarvan "alt coin" just makes less sense than with the fiat example.
Its value depends on trust and marketing, people buys bitcoin now because they can trade for profit. When that stops... Who knows.

Well many people talking here has no fucking idea either. But you are right (including yourself, most likely), I am not yet informed on the underlying technology past the blockchain concept.
And I still think you are misunderstanding here, I am only talking from a socioeconomic standpoint.
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:50:54
Certainly looked nothing. I only said *like in 2008*, bubble everyone denied. And it was as well an investment regardless who you asked, until the whole problem unleashed, then it was not an investment anymore but toxic assets bla bla bla. Money wasted in gambling that others had to cover.
In that case, however, physical assets were involved but in this particular case not even that. Thus, this trading has less of an actual investment that houses in Detroit back in 2008. 
Who knows what will happen in the future, though. But as for now people do not trust bitcoin, they like the volatility that allows them to make actual "real profits" (as per some of reditors words) in fiat money.
If tomorrow your 1000$ valued bitcoin would be valued at 0 because an altcoin takes over, then, I am sure you will see the difference between proper investment, gamgling and speculation.
So inferred a lot of wrong things I did not say on those few words, instead of going a bit deeper in thought. Just because your think everyone else is dumb or know nothing about finance/investing. FYI in 2008 I was making aggressive purchases with my fiat money.
There are to many people buying crypto currencies with leverage, even teenagers, not a good sign.
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:25:47
yeah, but I do know they do not increase its price that way daily. And I know as well that most people is not investing in the Forex, whereas they do here in several websites. Plus, the whole point about bitcoin is the trust on it to replace fiat not to sell it for dollars.
@_date: 2017-03-24 22:38:38
when they accept to be paid their salary in bitcoins, then that means they trust the currency and they are not just speculating.

Whatever, the quoted phrase sounds wrong to me when applied to a currency that says wants to take over fiat money and the dollar, and also act like gold as an asset to store value and... All things I have read here so far.
I think this BU is putting everyone too defensive and overreacting.
@_date: 2017-03-24 22:40:18
that is a separate problem, greediness. You could have dollars and something like PayPal in your bank for free.
In fact, ING Direct allows transfers from ING accounts to ING accounts for free. So it could be the same for everything.
Bitcoins, IMHO, are not meant to solve that particular problem.

@_date: 2017-03-28 18:06:54
totally, the marketing effort was put on Bitcoin(R) not on CloneBitcoin. But if an "altcoin" appears as superior, sooner or later should take over *if* people trusts it.
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:30:36
I thought this was a currency people trust, to actually use instead of fiat money, not an investment / trading / speculation vehicle.

what do you mean ? he trusts in the currency, you did not read ? 
He has all the money he need in bitcoin why sell money ? he should purchase things he wants and needs using it no ? ah, no sorry, this is like gold a chunk of metal to speculate with but "in the cloud".

I think bitcoin goes rampage because no one knows to short it, to many kids playing to be investors/traders/radicals.
But everyone is counting how much they win in dollars, thus, their trust on the crypto asset is closest to 0. Its true value long term if this continues this way.
They day the teenager out there learns how to short this... -20% daily until this stays in a more reasonable price.

@_date: 2017-03-26 18:33:06
that is cool, it will keep growing like the houses in 2008, they never stop!
Now, think why is it that even your neighbor is purchasing bitcoins with leverage. Is it trust ? investment ? or something more like gambling in a bubble situation?
May or may not be a bubble, but... since there are dozens of cryptocurrencies why one has to take over and be the most investing despite not being technologically superior ?
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:51:10
Disagree? what the f*k you mean I disagree? I just said that it sounds strange, that I like the benefits from the LN and the concept but it does not feels right once you expressed it in terms of banks with reserves, fractional systems, etc.
And I said, in that case, you already have the bloody fiat currency that everyone trusts, and PayPal, etc. And gold for the rest.
Which does not mean I disagree on Bitcoin Core or BU if that is all you have now in your head.
Nevermind, you are just a teenager with too much testosterone to burn.

well if he "created" a virtual asset, with trust that is equivalent to 2$ he should be happy. Also, he would have the coins on the other chain as well isn´t it ?
however, why people using cryptocurrencies never stop referencing the dollar ? does not seem like bitcoin can replace any fiat current at the moment or in the near future.
@_date: 2017-03-27 16:59:04
If tomorrow 1 Bitcoin was worth it 100K and then later on a +10% daily, suddenly. And everyone in the world wanted bitcoins that they need to pay using fiat money... that would not be good I think... I mean, I can foresee lot of problems with that premise.
As it happens with gold, is more an insurance than any other think, you will not be able to pay with chunk of metal really. Like if you were a pirate or something.

Risk reward profile, risk aversion, those are the words you are looking for. And as I said, ultimately you are right in your wording. We cannot just compare investing in a lottery ticket, tesla stock, cryptocurrencies, bonds, etc.
But as you say, you seek for value. The value of a currency with this mad volatility... is not that obvious, again, if it turns out it takes over the world then you won your gamble. But any altcoin could.
Also, there is more actual value in spacex or tesla than in currencies, fiat or otherwise. But there is a social component here, separate of the financial value we are talking.
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:47:29
yeah and you get your salary in bitcoins as well, and you pay in the supermarket in bitcoins as well, ah no, you use amazon for that. Sure yeah, your pokemon coins are paid with fiat, most likely.
No offense,  but sounds again like a plain lie. You cannot replace fiat money completely, not today. Unless you live with your parents and they pay you the electricity for mining.
@_date: 2017-03-26 12:28:15
Not true, invest means also funding for it to be able to grow and meet daily cash requirements, research, etx. You only play with price fluctuations. But ultimately you are right, just...again, it is not the same the Tesla stock speculation than currency trading, euribor manipulation, etc.
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:32:37


Do you read yourself ?
I like the idea of LN, but that sounds like madness in a virtual currency world. For that, you have fiat already, which unlike Bitcoin people actually trust instead of purchasing it - not for using it everyday - but in hope it will be valued many dollars in the future.
I don't know, something feels wrong there.
@_date: 2017-03-28 01:05:01

When you talk about trust you mean global trust. If people decided not to take Dollars anymore then Dollars are worth 0. Except, military force and laws can apply.
With Bitcoins, it is not possible to enforce anything as such (in theory) but still its value depends in trust of its participants and there was a point where someone made a transaction in which a price discovery was set (in Dollars equivalent, or goods) but from that... I can see a lot of speculation.
@_date: 2017-04-02 19:08:16

Goldman Sachs was a reputable organization in 2008 as well. And Leman Brothers.
It can impact national currencies indeed, but so far by very little to justifify the massive increase in its price, there are not millions of people using it compared to a year ago. Nor you can use it properly because of high fees, slow confirmation, speculative value: why pay coffee with gold?
Also, extreme volatility. Not everyone is capable of keeping bitcoins secure, use them,etc. Nor that people will be willing to accept Bitcoins most certainly.

That is a way to do it... trading risk (since it could also go up you lose that potential profit).
@_date: 2017-04-10 10:10:01
Well, I think people is overreacting a bit. And bitcoin is closer to something like Gold than a national currency like the Dollar.
Bitcoin is a system where you pay fees for any transaction which at the moment takes a lot of time to be confirmed, and in top of that it is not as simple the average individual to use. So, unlikely it will be going  to replace the Dollar/Euro anytime soon but who knows.
However, implying "we are so bullish" because of that is non-sense. The value of a Bitcoin depends entirely on the trust from people on it, it could be valued at 0 and at some point it was valued at 0.
The only reason people is bullish is because many managed to mine cheap coins (using "free" electricity or when coins where easy to mine)  , that and pure speculation. Leaving aside, black markets, etc.
There are dozens of altcoins nowadays, based on the same technology.

There is something I do not understand, would you pay your coffee with gold ?
My question is, Bitcoin is considered a safe haven currency or a replacement for fiat money for everyday use that will compete with the dollar ?
@_date: 2017-04-06 22:59:47
Even if they use ASICBOOST, so what ? it was super easy to mine early days vs now as well plus it is how the protocol was done. 
Everyone could do it.
@_date: 2017-04-04 20:38:19
So, everything around cryptocurrencies moves around the miners. Makes sense I guess, for those that want to mine Bitcoins expecting the price go higher and for those trading and speculating.
Also seems Bitcoin is a bit unfair for late participants in the marke, not willing to mine.
@_date: 2017-04-03 13:19:00
I would not call that fundamental factors, I agree with the first and last point on the list. But... Re: volatility? Lol
As I said, why pay coffee "with gold" when you can use cheap dollars ? Saving the Bitcoins for the future when they are more valuable.
The isue with that reasoning is that for everyone to use bitcoins for everything (or one of them) they should stop focusing on pretty much using it for speculative trading, buy and hold or safe haven. 
Trust is the base of any currency, but... Is not enough.
Edit: at the end of the day, who knows, blockchain is a great technology. Everything could happen, even though we have seen some issues in terms of scalability and insane speculation (which may well pay off as a gamble like the people early mining)
@_date: 2017-04-12 11:26:11

Good while people pump the exchange rate, but once merchants note that within 1 week the bitcoin they received costs 25% less Yen(s)... I wonder if they will be willing to accept this awesome mechanism of payment.
You can pay with gold as well, after all.
@_date: 2017-04-06 23:29:09
Of course, good reason to just keep going up... nevermind virtually no one else actually uses it in real economy, but only to speculate and hold.
Some people just mined/mines and the rest try to convince this volatility is all normal, so they bring dollars into it for the traders to   make profit.

*Gold Supply Rises With Large Mine Discovery, Bitcoin is Better Safe Haven Asset*
That is just a plain lie. Hardcore manipulation; There are also dozens of "altcoins" and more coming so with a marginal cost of 0 for creating a new altcoin how bitcoin is affected then?
Gold is a physical asset, with properties, can be used in real world as a material and for purchasing goods and services (at least, in theory) whereas the only property of bitcoin to maintain its value other than forced scarcity is trust and marketing.
@_date: 2017-04-02 20:20:24
No, that is not the reason why gold is noy used today. And no, gold was never fiat currency... So it was never money as we understand it today.
Plus, silver was used as well,etc.

@_date: 2017-04-02 19:17:09
Bitcoin born already cheating like the fiat money, by those mining early, or with electricity not paid by them or in countries where it is cheaper for complicated reasons.
Then pumping the coin, mining, and getting more by trading their current profit with leverage.
Sorry, just talking on loud.
Just few selected will be able to use the super-class asset named Bitcoin. The altcoins are nothing compared, nevermind they are created the same way with less marketing.
@_date: 2017-04-05 21:21:32
Yeah man, the people that are actually not using their fiat money to buy the coins need people spending actual real world money on it.
So their mining makes sense and the trading continues.
@_date: 2017-04-02 23:24:59
So you agree in that Bitcoin is safe haven like gold and fiat like dollar? 
You can write all hahha gtfo you want. You still put 0 argument.

*"Koreas Positive Regulation"* who cares anyway, just 2 country of many. What about China ? Also, it does not mean anything implicit so its value skyrockets just because of it.
*Japanese Companies Integrating Bitcoin payment systems* 
Yet still, no one in Japan actually uses Bitcoin other than on anecdotal cases, this is cool but pure propaganda. Nevertheless.
*Transaction Fees Down* No comments on that, it may surely be dropping but not because LN is everywhere now.
*Transaction Speeds Are Up* more marketing, not a lie but far from the actual reality.
*Robinhood With 1 Million plus waitlist, Square Adds Bitcoin, Revolut Above 100k Users* 
ok so what ? there are also dozens of altcoins and exchanges.
*Great Tech Coming in 2018* whatever, probably paid in Dollars.
Pure marketing and guesses.

I can not disagree more with that. Nevertheless, you based your point of view on past performance and cycles of selloffs. It does not make much sense, and I am more than happy to hear about those **fundamentals** that you are talking about and so we are on the same page: 
And no - it is not likely to happen again - it can or cannot. For the same reason one could argue that since we had bubbles in the past *it is likely that it will happen again* by quoting your phrase.
Truth is no one actually knows, but there are thousands of other cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:38:57
I was too tired, when I said "The money on your bank account does not earn you money by just sitting there"
I meant the value of the currency itself, not your balance on the account. Not the interest earned.


Perhaps, but you also have Paypal and plenty of other stuff, plus Gold and Silver, etc. At the moment, Bitcoin is not solving anything... in the future, another currency can take over maybe a better technology than Blockchain and LN.

Everything looks easy in the graph, years later.

People looking for confirmation bias, when they cannot find it, they outrage to others. Apparently.
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:39:17


For general public to adopt it and invest. It is not the same investing 1000$ when BTC is valued at 20K than 1000$ when BTC is valued at 700$, or when your coins come from mining with your computer CPU dozens of coins per week. Also, there are dozens of cryptocurrencies and new and better technology can appear *anytime*.
Why buy a 20K asset when I can do exactly the same with Etherum, Litecoin or whatever currency clones Bitcoin and costs 1/10th of it ? The only thing you have to do is hold an indoctrinate others until the coin goes up.


I meant Safe Haven if I was not clear, and no. Those are opposite things it *cannot* be like gold and a fiat currency such as the Dollar. (Also, you would not normally pay coffee with actual gold nowadays nor it can sustain the current economy).


No, the US Dollar is not meant to be hold as a store of value like Gold. The USD is stable because of many reasons (and not sure about the FED bit nowadays, but yes).


So what ? it is still fiat money, same as Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a technological component, but so it does the US Dollar as you can see.


Which is crucial to understand debt and economy. That said, you should also pay tax from your Bitcoins or else how are public services going to run ? Do not answer this.


Sure, just like happens today with ICO scams, exchanges being hacked, ponzi schemes as well as people inflating the value of Bitcoin (...and GPU cards and the Earth temperature) just because of trading. Also people had something to do about it, was not just the banks. A lot of people took the free money thinking they could get more money later.


I agree with the fact our system is not great, but I disagree with the "by a long shot" part. In fairness, the better system would be one where we do not even need money.
And yeah... Bitcoin, really is just like points, just with some crypto added to make sure it cannot be forged but it is as unfair to late adopters (and the society) as Gold and current fiat were in the past, I do not see such improvement and liberation... just marketing and people trading.
Bitcoin is dropping because people is realizing gains into US Dollars, Euros, Pounds, etc. And because of some tether printing USDT.
About the rest I am not going to comment really, you seem convinced and I doubt anyone can make you change your mind on the matter.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:16:27
Ok with me.

For some reason people trading stocks are associated to thieves but those trading cryptocurrencies are "pioners" and "investors".

@_date: 2018-02-03 02:07:42
What is the difference of a "nocoiner" vs a "hodler" in terms of actual trust in Bitcoin to be used as a currency and not as a trading instrument?
- Bitcoin is not good store of value, 
- Bitcoin is not working as a currency at the moment, 
- It uses lot of electricity and resources which makes no sense (even though the blockchain is a brilliant concept)
- Can be tracked, so it is not that anonymous even (compared to say Monero)
- No working smart contracts or lightning network (this can be inaccurate, though, ignore this line if you feel I just lied on this).
The only use for Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies at the moment, in general) is pure gambling. Some even are a total scam.
Basically, hodlers want to get rich by not using the currency and waiting for it to go up, so they get more value *in dollars*. While indoctrinating everyone to actually use Bitcoin so a) trust increases, thus value b) it actually can be used as a currency.
So basically everyone complains here about "fud" but the only thing most of the people invested in Bitcoin are spreading is propaganda and marketing (by the exchanges) who also make money.
The only reason this volatility is good for Bitcoin it is because it can be used to trade and profit from it. Nothing more, nothing else.
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:10:40
Probably it was paid with bitcoin converted into fiat. But who cares, it helps to confirmation bias.

Bitcoin, such a friendly coin, it will free everyone from the banksters.
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:05:15
I doubt so, if you hold the money you are not using it. 
If you are not using the money because you want to earn a modest % then... LN does not matter because you are not using it as fiat currency. The money on your bank account does not earn you interest by just sitting there, banks move it and it gets invested in companies which do research, sell, etc.


Why then I will use Bitcoin when I can use USD or Euro, or any other cheaper crypto that does not go up year over year ?
So well, not sure of anything you just said but I doubt Bitcoin can replace USD under those premises. In fact, it seems to me that needs the USD so that can actually be the case.
In other words, I do not think Bitcoin can *replace* other fiat currency such as the US Dollar and Banks. At most, if everyone agrees, it could replace Gold.
But Gold is physical, cannot be cloned. Bitcoin is not. Can be cloned and crypto does not even matter.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:59:12
So we have some guy saying it will reach $1.000.000 (or else will do something atrocious), then others saying it should be worth it $20.

No. They also get it when you buy at max price aka overvalued.
Of course, in years or months from now who knows.

I´d say they should be giving example and show how they USE their bitcoin and spend it - without converting it to 'traditional' fiat first - to pay for services, like coffee, clothes, salaries, etc.
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:51:22

There is also code in pokemon and points in any videogame and in banks and databases. And in the torrent protocol.
Blockchain uses crypto, to forge immutable transactions and a distributed database simplifying the concept a lot. That is all, pretty much.
If you put serial numbers in papers and only print 1000, as long as you commit not to create more papers and people trust you... should be minimal difference. Leaving aside obvious things paper cannot do.

I would not be surprised if he is shorting Bitcoin, but he may well be right. After all, Bitcoin only has value because of trust and agreement nothing else.

@_date: 2018-02-02 01:48:08
It is very easy to make mistakes like that so do not be harsh on yourself, even with stock, happens all the time to those that do not trade professionally.
Look at this stock,
 put the chart to max. You will be surprised.
So people thought they could buy cheap in hope it would recover, but reverse-splits and dilution continued (several) and well, many got into it as a lottery.
Also, no one really knows if Bitcoin will recover, if it will reach 50K or if it will drop to 700$ or less. It may go to 1K and eventually back to 20K after some years (/days).
I suppose, you have to see the overall cryptoscene to get an idea of the future that the blockchain can bring to currencies. No need to say, it is EXTREMELY risky and exposure should be minimized or - in most cases - avoided.
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:55:56

@_date: 2018-02-03 03:54:51


it does not have to. There is nothing to censor. Mobiles phones do not need to be all water resistant either. I do not think this point adds value to our conversation.


Plenty of people does it. Actually.
Will you not accept 1000 Google shares?


Emmm... well there are ETFs of a lot of things including Bitcoin and also... everyone compares Bitcoin against the USD no ?  I do not think this matters in this discussion.


I trust more Intel, AMD, PayPal, Tesla, Samsung, Google and plenty of other companies that actually add value to the world than Bitcoin, and sure thing Google can disappear but it is not really a concern. Long term, Bitcoin can disappear as well before the company that makes ASIC to mine it.


Points in a game with some crypto could be the same. Means nothing. And if it is "more like gold" but you can clone it... then such scarcity is non-existant. It can only have real value if people trust it and can use it for either trade it for other fiat or use it as a currency. But as you say, it is "more like gold" so less like "money".


Not really, just volatility is much more higher but ok, I do not fully disagree. Open this,  and set timeframe in the graphic to "max".
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:13:24
Such confirmation bias.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:41:11
There are several reasons to hold. I understand that, however, you should realize it should drop much more in price, stop volatility, be usable before that happens.
But seems everyone agrees now that Bitcoin is "store of value" but it cannot be both. Bitcoin cannot be accumulating value via hodlers and people investing and be a currency that is used to pay coffee on a daily basis and buying stuff in the supermarket... not even with Lightning Network (let alone is complex to the average *user*).
Also there is speed and fees issues as well which honestly... why on Earth one would be paying those fees now when you could use a regular transfer or Paypal. 
If you purchased at 20K and with this sudden drop, obviously you will hodl. Unless you are a cold trader and cut your loses early.
