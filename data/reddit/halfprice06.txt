I get your point but I don't think the law would work like that.
@_date: 2019-07-21 02:41:02
There isn't much legal precedent for this situation, but its possible that she would have a right to sue him to get it back,  depending on state property law, because he did donate the bitcoin to her.  very interesting situation.  
i think the analysis would depend very much on state law and could be different everywhere.
@_date: 2019-07-21 03:58:45
That's not likely how the court would value it in my opinion.  But without looking at specific state law can't be certain. 
Consider a different scenario. 
I give you a car with a key.  A few years later, you lose the key to the car.  I secretly kept a spare key when I gave you the car. 
Can I claim ownership of the car now just because I kept a copy of the key this whole time?

I currently have an extremely basic programming knowledge, but I want to learn more.  Are there are suggestions are resources for someone wanting to do bitcoin and programming as a hobby?
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:00:06
100% taxable
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:54:23
I once traded like 4-5 bitcoins for a Korg synthesizer worth, at the time, like $70.  
That's a big oof for me in retrospect.
@_date: 2019-12-18 22:01:17
I'm confused.   When you push your PC, your CPU usage seems low, and that to you, indicates someone might be using your PC to mine bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-12-19 02:02:50
Good point
@_date: 2019-12-18 21:50:23
What makes you think that?
@_date: 2019-12-11 02:26:14
Don't forget to pay your capital gains tax
@_date: 2019-12-18 23:34:09
You would need like 100 million PC's infected for this to work. 
30% of 1000 CPUs isnt going to mine any Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-18 22:26:49
Gotcha.  In my opinion, if they were mining your pc would become noticeably slower/unstable.  Mining on a CPU is also a waste of time for just about everyone so I doubt that is what is going on.
@_date: 2012-09-11 00:45:19
ohhh gotcha. ok. yeah, i'm trying to get verified with mt gox right now and i've already been denied once. we'll see how long it takes. 
@_date: 2012-08-17 22:29:31
well put titty-fucker

normally the term "two edged sword" or more commonly "double edged should" describe something with one side good and one side bad.
I was confused reading your title because it sounded as if you meant those were both good. 
just an fyi

What are aml policies? sorry excuse my un-knowledge
@_date: 2012-08-17 19:58:26
like, um how early?
@_date: 2012-08-18 01:16:39
bubble's pop!
@_date: 2011-06-16 06:06:46
at the current difficulty, 40,000 khash will only get you four one hundredths of a bitcoin each day. The cost of electricity makes it not worth it. You can do it for fun maybe, but a better idea might be to just  buy a few coins via sites like Tradehill.com or mtgox 
@_date: 2011-06-16 15:04:18
mt gox is in japan, you think they would pressure the japanese government to try and shut it down? i don't...
@_date: 2011-07-03 05:01:14
im a musician and I actually plan on doing this if I do release an album in the next year. 
i will only accept bitcoin as payment
@_date: 2011-06-17 14:03:35
Any sales yet?
@_date: 2011-06-17 14:06:31
don't be mad at me bro. im not affiliated with mtgox
have you tried the mtgox subreddit? 
try posting there, i believe it was created by mtgox themselves
@_date: 2011-07-03 04:56:35
um, kinda creepy
@_date: 2011-08-15 22:25:43
i think you accidentally the link...
@_date: 2011-05-30 05:26:17
yeah, probably not worth it. invest in some bitcoin maybe. but don't spend your life savings.
@_date: 2011-06-16 06:13:17
MT gox isn't even based out of the us. Also the thing with the senators has been reposted here several times from several different blogs. The senators are worried about silk road not bitcoin.

@_date: 2011-06-16 06:00:42
False alarm. 
@_date: 2011-06-15 03:10:38
i think you accidentally the link
@_date: 2011-06-16 18:26:41
Fear mongering 
@_date: 2011-06-16 18:28:31
You'd have to be pretty thick to upload your wallet to a site like that. But good looking out for the less tech savvy out there. 
@_date: 2011-06-13 01:56:18
Not many people will go for a 5% fee to pay in bitcoins whenever they could just use dollars. Unless they got those coins for cheap, or mining. 
@_date: 2011-06-21 03:42:08
i think if you send less then one bitcoin, the .01 fee is required. i transferred 3 bitcoins with no fee yesterday. 
then again im probably completely wrong so someone hopefully will correct me. 
@_date: 2011-06-17 13:51:06
wait it out, you'll probably be alright
@_date: 2011-06-17 15:16:44
honestly I think that we should have more vendors that accept exclusively in bitcoin. it gives incentive for people to buy/mine bitcoins, and actually spend them as bitcoins. 
i mean, of course, they need to have a decent product people will actually want. 
@_date: 2011-06-17 15:15:09
i did a mtgox transfer and it seemed to take forever. i waited and it eventually went through. 
it was my advice.
@_date: 2011-06-08 20:42:19
Snooze you lose
@_date: 2011-06-17 18:55:42
yeah, click your link, it brings you back to this page...
@_date: 2011-05-27 00:45:01
there's a guy i saw in the bitcoin forums with over 300,000
@_date: 2011-06-11 07:32:01
Where can you buy the 5850
@_date: 2011-06-16 06:07:47
@_date: 2011-06-15 19:48:15
care to elaborate, im not hip on trading
@_date: 2011-06-16 05:40:50
Yes the total number of Bitcoins would be irreversiblely reduced. However a single bitcoin can be split into one hundred million parts. So the economy wouldn't be destroyed. People could simply start trading with smaller bitcoin chunks. Instead of 1 bitcoin for 20 usd, maybe one hundredth of a bitcoin for 20 usd. 
@_date: 2011-06-21 16:44:00
my dwolla to tradehill took about 3 days...
@_date: 2011-07-03 04:54:55
anyone else actually stomach it long enough to laugh at the fact that he is trying to prove that bitcoin is decentralized?
he keeps saying, "here's another point why bitcoin isn't centralized"
this dude kills me dead
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:03:29
yeah I get your point. I just don't think it is a good way for anyone right now to store wealth...
it's an experiment. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:11:23
Actually you know, I bet there are some people deep into Bitcoin who don't really care if it ever goes "mainstream."
@_date: 2013-07-27 22:27:12
Odd. 
@_date: 2013-08-19 15:48:52
People are paying stupid amounts on ebay for these things..... Sell it
@_date: 2013-08-10 19:17:38
can you elaborate? 
I think it's a very cool idea.
Are you saying you don't think it's a good idea because the software isn't built yet?
@_date: 2013-10-26 01:20:52
It was sarcasm..... 
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:16:55
The price rising isn't the issue. It's people selling bitcoins that causes the issues.  
@_date: 2013-07-27 04:20:06
Wat.  There's a sign that says they accept it....? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:04:15
I agree. But that won't happen until people start *using* bitcoins and not just buying and selling them. 
If you buy them and never spend them as bitcoins, then why did you even buy them?
The only answer is greed. 
@_date: 2013-08-14 02:00:13
i use coinbase
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:57:13
I don't understand how he can claim caused the crash.
That makes no sense at all...
@_date: 2013-09-17 05:52:08
Yeah but when bitcoin reaches $100000 per coin we'll have donated the most of all!  
@_date: 2013-07-30 13:48:33
Why does your grandma or your father have to understand or use bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-08-13 14:18:03
or the price of bitcoin could go up...
@_date: 2013-05-11 07:52:30
not sure you understand what a pyramid scheme is...
@_date: 2013-08-13 20:58:31
Definitely not the first bitcoin charity
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:13:02
why should anyone store wealth in bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-04-24 00:19:17
I purchased one of these. It's pretty neat. 
@_date: 2013-09-06 12:40:17
Hey if you are still doing this and are sincere I'd love a chance to get some Btc! 
@_date: 2013-05-05 17:49:16
My critique would be its value doesn't only change according to how many USD gets pumped into. You'd be forgetting how many euros, yen, etc.  If bitcoin takes off big time I china or india then you could see more money from there going into bitcoin then USD alone
@_date: 2013-08-11 13:52:13
Yeah but did you ever get your money out of mtgox..... 
@_date: 2013-10-18 16:16:40
contact customer service. I had an issue similar and they resolved it pretty quickly. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 01:07:16
don't know why you are  being downvoted, that's solid advice
@_date: 2013-08-13 16:30:47
I mean it makes them both more profitable. Lol but I agree, right now unless you have serious money to invest, people should be buying bitcoin rather than paying so much for mining equipment. I just sold a butterfly labs jalapeño on ebay for 1.3k. I pre-ordered it for 150 bucks. So I'm happy with that. I could have mined with it for a year and made maybe 10-15 bitcoin but instead I can use the money now about buy 13 btc with it if I want.
@_date: 2013-07-30 03:26:13
couldn't even finish reading the article.  the best thing is to just ignore people like that lol.
it's cool, bitcoins not for you.  who cares if amazon.com doesn't want to do bitcoin... like really who cares...
