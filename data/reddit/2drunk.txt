This is what needs to happen for Bitcoin.  
Seriously, while I love the idea of Bitcoin ATMs and hope they continue to sprout up everywhere, this is a less costly and more user friendly solution to get Bitcoin in every store.
I'm surprised this hasn't gained more traction. Imagine Bitcoin (or branded Coinbase) cards sitting right next to visa gift cards. I know you can.

I watched the whole thing. Very well done Mr Antonopoulos.
The guy sitting directly across from Andreas seemed very positive towards bitcoin. I wouldn't be surprised if he is on r/bitcoin reading this thread right now .
 The older french speaking guy on the left seemed perplexed and angry at the idea. Hard to tell if he was joking.
 The third guy on the left seemed confused but amazed.
The other guy on the left Douglas Black seemed like he wanted to figure out how they could get regulation right so jobs are created in Canada. Which is positive. Also, I think making the distinction between blockchain and off chain transactions helped. Along with personal use/banking vs multi-million dollar financial services use.
The women seemed neutral, but supporting.
The two guys on the right didn't get it but were open to it and tried hard as hell to make Andreas crack a smile.
I think the detractors and people sitting on the sidelines just need to use it to understand it.

Depends on what you want to do
You have high level languages and low level (close to the metal) languages. Then in between you have different types 
You will quickly learn when it comes to CPU intensive tasks, Javascript has limitations. Don't get me wrong, it's a good language for web related and front end stuff. There are work arounds of course, but it can get pretty messy. Callback hell for example.
I agree with Go (Golang). It's a new language, but is easy to learn, cross platform, growing fast, clean, compiled like C and C++ and similar syntax, concurrent  and will introduce you to all the basics like pointers, structs and maps. Comes with garbage collection. It is comparable to C in performance and you can use C code with Go. You can't go wrong with Go.  Take the tour  and never look back.
But if your goal is to contribute to the main bitcoin project itself you will have to learn C++.

For me, there can only be one. I will only use BTC. 
0.00156250 feels right. Shifting decimal places might make you feel like you hold more, but it also makes you feel like you are spending more. If i had a store I would definitely list products in BTC. Makes customers actually look into bitcoin when they see something listed in what looks like cents.
that, and I think it confuses the shit out of people. People don't like math.

If users are rewarded they will produce more content, maybe even better quality content.
I think it's perfect for youtube, open source projects, indie games, and question and answer sites like stack overflow.
It would be less intrusive than ads and asking for donations everytime producers/creators need a fix. 
@_date: 2014-08-30 21:47:59
If it's not broke, don't fix it. Bitcoin has been growing steadily without it. 
i personally think the price is a selling point not the other way around. Changing the default unit will probably have the opposite effect long term. Less media coverage of huge price swings and less people interested in finding out why people are spending huge sums of money on Bitcoin. It might be like changing the UI on your favorite site.   
I don't see why individual apps/exchanges can't test the water out. It doesn't have to be all or nothing. If it takes off then other apps will follow.

2050 a single corporation runs everything,  pays very litttle because there is no competition and no other places to work. The story centers around one person who introduces a new system and amasses a following of believers. The corporation does not like it and using it resources, tries to manipulate the public to turn on them and each other.
Another idea is to make it a sci fi comedy. There are not too many good sci fi comedies lately. Comedy always keeps people interested.

His background fits and he's about the age I thought he would be.  It's obvious he prefers privacy over fame, but I think he was proud of his work and that is why at first he used his real name as his pseudonym. He wanted recognition but didn't want to be the face of something so big. I don't think he had any idea it would take off and decided to leave the project because it did.
I hope people respect his privacy and don't continue to try and interview him. He's just an old school programmer that wants to be left alone.

You just add another address to your wallet. Each key pair is its own wallet. 
You can import them in bitcoin-qt if that is what you mean and store them together.
@_date: 2014-06-15 02:06:05
Think of your wallet as your email address. Nobody knows your email address unless you give it to them. Sure they could guess it (that would take a very long time) and send you email (bitcoin). To access it and do what they want with your email account they would need your password (private key) and that would take even longer if you picked a long random password.
Also, Keys are generated on the fly, theoretically someone could generate the same key pair as you. Which is known as a collision. That is why cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generation is important.

Here's an idea. Full nodes could be saving accounts. Make it optional. You collect interest on what you hold when full node is running.  Put a min and max cap on the interest you can recieve.
Users running full nodes with less than a certain amount of BTC receive nothing. Users need to reach a certain amount of processed transactions to recieve interest.
Maybe even implement some type of captcha (I have no idea how this could work, just tossing it out there) that pops up randomly and needs to be entered within a given time frame to collect interest.
Like proof of stake with a twist and without losses.

I ran litecoin qt on the sucker before. So it should handle it until the blockchain becomes too big for your 32gb sd card.  You could use a usb external hd when the time comes.
It took a long time for it to start up though. You will probably want to lower the checkblocks in your bitcoin.conf so it loads faster. Once it loads and is running smoothly with very little resources it should work fine.
I wouldn't use it to make transactions, import keys or anything that you would use a normal wallet for. Never know when the sd card will become corrupt.

 It doesn't need to be like bitcoins blockchain or work the same way. It would work more like a database. It could automatically get rid of data after a set amount of time or if it meets some criteria. But someone needs to provide the data and that data needs to be checked by peers.

Yep, I think this provision is in case bitcoin goes belly up like the housing market. They don't want a future bitcoin Lehman Brothers.

@_date: 2014-07-02 09:47:01
While I agree it's arbitaray. It has become the de facto standard. It's what most people use and what the exchanges use as default. It's what the news mentions when discussing the price of bitcoin.  
Until everything is priced in bits and bloomberg mentions bits instead of btc it wont change. To make a impact, exchanges would need to force bits on users.
Right now it's just adding another layer of complexity into an already complex ecosystem.

Good points.  Each one of those could have sub systems that are connected and give an overall score.  
For instance, Reputation gained over time from users with high seniority compared to other users to prevent false reputation being gained.  Besides from that the system could have rep rating agencies for added protection.
Maybe the system could even hold its own reserves from fees collected and programmatically reward the good actors by lower fees or free services based on past behavior. Give them financial incentive to remain good.

it's not their fault they don't know about bitcoin or know bitcoin has reputable payment processors now that take all the hard work out of it. Maybe they thought you still had to set up your own node and hold it. Maybe they still think its too complicated.
most of the places that accept bitcoin were built around bitcoin and probably read r/bitcoin daily. which is fine and nice but some don't have products or deals i want.
I don't know about you but I imagine a day i don't have to search for services that accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-21 05:01:41
not really, that is why most merchant sites and businesses accept credit cards, paypal and use things like amazon payments  instead of run their own payment processor.
