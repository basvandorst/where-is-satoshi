Stable? Where were you in December?
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:19:04
Will do! Thnx!
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:36:21
I'm interested in this as well! Bit of a n00b.

Yeah.. We have all these luxuries at the cost of people from the other side of the world. Capitalism is destroying the earth (just as btc does with its power consumption).
There are more systems out there than monarchies or communism. Please read up on them.

I've got a couple of reasons. Feel free to correct them if they're bullshit. I feel like this 3rd party is like putting my cash in a bank account.
I'll be on the road for the coming time. No fixed address. So carrying them around with me seems even riskier. Just like carrying a bulk if cash is.
Also I'd like to play with the coins a bit. See if I can turn a bit of a profit. Wirex to me seems like an easy and fast way to switch between euros and bitcoin. Though I haven't really read a lot about the trading part yet.
Another reason is I'd actually like to use bitcoin as a means of paying. Being abroad a lot would make it an ideal currency.

I think we're both talking about an equally utopian world.
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:05:34
I think I have some more reading to do haha. I'll probably store them in a private wallet for now. Till I understand it all a bit better. 
Thnx! I'll make sure to check it out!

Rather a Bernie-bro than a Trumpet.. Go read some more about the difference between communism and socialism. Come back after you've formed an educated opinion.

Capitalism is about making profit. Profit has to come from somewhere. So it is always going to create inequality.
Money flows up.
@_date: 2018-06-26 11:08:16
But still the issue of profit remains. Where does the extra money come from? Someone has to pay for that.
In my view the only equaliser is heavy regulation. But not with the current "democracies"
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:22:16
Same here haha.. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:19:54
Socialism is not communism.. And it usually doesn't involve killing as far as I know. Stalin was not the best example.. No offence but you must be from the states.
@_date: 2018-06-26 11:12:22
No.. No system in use now will work. We're too corruptible as humans. 
Socialism does have its advantages. The times it has failed was because of corruption and power hungry people again. But somehow it got a really bad rep in the US. I don't get that.

I don't think they have that much of an influence really. But who knows.. As long as money is involved, nothing and nobody is to be trusted.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:20:03
Possibly. 
I probably have the same financial background as you. I would think it would be harder though. Because the market-cap would be way bigger and there are a lot more people involved. Wouldn't that help stability?
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:12:48
I actually do think we're breaking into the mainstream realm. I see the same kind of signs all around me. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:17:47
What would that do for CME?
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:09:48
I disagree.. Sure it got back up, but because of massive intervention and the market came really really close to collapsing. If anything 08 was a big big warning of what's to come. Because hardly anything significant has changed since.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:08:56
pocket chain.. I like it haha
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:14:33
We'll see. That all is a bridge too far for me. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 11:48:05
I doubt it very much haha
@_date: 2017-09-26 12:29:23
Couldn't resist.
