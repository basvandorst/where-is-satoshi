Not an expert here, but I would guess they'd trade with themselves (diff accts of course).  The right hand sells at below market, the left hand buys and drives the price down.  Then the weak hands follow pushing the price down further.  They can only push it down so far.  Asia would buy them up pretty fast.

I had a Coinbase account for a few years and hadn't used it for a while until recently.  When I tried logging in, my password had expired and needed to have them reset it via email.  My email account (33mail) went out of business so i had no access to it.  When I explained to them I needed my history for tax purposes they said I'd have to open a new account (go through all the KYC form uploads again) and then ask them to link the 2 accounts. All fine and dandy but now they ignore my emails asking to link the accounts.  After 5x+ attempted contacts I've given up.

Dollar cost averaging is a good way to invest.  Put the same amount every week or every other week, whenever you get paid and don't worry what the price of a bitcoin is.  You'll end up buying more when the price is less and less when the price is high. It takes the guesswork out on when to buy.
