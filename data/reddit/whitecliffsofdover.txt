I've been trying since around 4PM est and it kept saying server maintenance. (can upload proof of account creation time)

Coinjar is probably the best option, with only a 2% fee, which is even better than some traders on LocalBitcoins.

I noticed that too but I haven't found any announcements or anything like that. 
I didn't bother using it anyway due to the very high fees (around 20% IIRC).

Or in the worst case scenario, people just go to the competitors' who don't use bitcoins. You'd risk alienating those who would most likely contribute the most towards your profit (the general public). 
I'm all for widespread bitcoin adoption, but until the general public has a better understanding of bitcoin, I don't really think using bitcoin as the sole payment option will be viable. 
Yes, bitcoin should certainly be an option and should be encouraged with discounts etc,, but as a sole method for mainstream retail, probably not yet.

YMMV, but whenever I used Tor it was ridiculously slow.

Seems like they act as a middleman by paying the pizza shop to send it to you.

I could see such a site used widely, and it could help adoption, but there is still a risk of isolated incidents going unsolved, corrupt reputation sites, sites going rogue after large transactions etc. 
Browsing through the Bitcoin Wiki or even I see many sites going rogue and disappearing with their bitcoin, or sites still operating with the occasional user not receiving their product etc. Most sites seemed to have a decent reputation before becoming a scam. 
Even if it does work out, the problem of being SOL if you're a victim of fraud or getting hacked still is a very, very big barrier. 
Most people aren't exactly technologically savvy and probably use Paypal or credit cards etc., and the moment they know they aren't protected from hackers and unauthorized transactions, a large amount of people would probably be discouraged and turned off it. 
It is an inherent feature of Bitcoin, and there really isn't any way to protect fully against it, so unfortunately, I think there are still a lot of challenges before we get widespread adoption.

Why would anyone trust someone who has no proof of what they're doing and someone who just created their account an hour ago with anything at all?

I always hear about stories from the merchant losing out (i've been screwed over myself a few times too) but not much from the consumers point of view. 
Consumers don't really have the benefit of having the ability to do a chargeback in case their item doesn't get delivered, funds get stolen, seller goes rogue etc. when using Bitcoin. Sure, customers might get cheaper prices from stores if there's no fraudulent chargebacks, but putting all the power into the merchant and allowing them to determine whether the customer gets a refund just doesn't make sense from the customers point of view. 
I had my credit card stolen and fraudulent purchases were made. I had no choice but to file a claim and get my money back. 
With bitcoin's system of 'tough luck, your money is gone', my money would have been lost forever, and it'll be hard to get widespread consumer adoption if this happens. 
To be honest, as a consumer, I'd rather pay a bit extra for CC/Paypal services for peace of mind that I won't get burned if fraud does occur, and as an occasional EBay seller, I think I'd just have to bear the chargeback costs myself and just cut my losses.
