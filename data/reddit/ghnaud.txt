Bitcoin has already been hacked to create over 21 milj coins (  ).

Yes, you can. I think you are not really aware what idling means in context of cars ( or CPU's ( ). You can put miner as an CPU's idle process to consume all CPU. Sure its not efficient, you shouldn't use CPU's to mine bitcoin as its inefficient, you should use ASIC. 
SETI at home is an example of processing done using idling resources:

neither mining bitcoin is solving sudokus. Its an analogy.
@_date: 2018-08-17 10:41:00
The analogy wasn't about energy/fuel consumption. It was about doing something "meaningless" to produces something you can trade for heroin.

I think you should check reply. The analogy is not perfect, but it works. Analogies are never perfect.

That's worse analogy. Idling consumes gas as well as you need to keep motor running. Driving continuously would provide additional utility which mining does not really do. Idling keeps motor running like mining keeps block chain running :).

It was a hack. Hacks are often based on bugs.
@_date: 2018-10-09 11:14:44
Yeah, hacks are generally based on to the software implementation :). How can you even hack "a definition of Bitcoin"?
It depends when its noticed and how fast a patch is implemented. If it takes one week to make a patch and get everyone to upgrade, you would need to roll back the chain one week.

Do you know of a hack that is not based on a bug?

Yep, one satoshi is worth more than a gold atom.

he is speaking about unprofitable mining rigs and not crypto.

Bitcoin is not deflatonary. It has an inflation.

They can last forever as long as they are getting more btc in than out. The lost BTC is just costs to them to run their business.
