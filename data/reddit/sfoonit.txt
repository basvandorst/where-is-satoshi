To be honest, the network needs scaling. If there is no proper scaling introduced soon (Lightning looks promising, but probably will not be enough) then I don't think it's a given that Bitcoin will hold its  place in market cap. But we'll have to wait and see. I'm hopeful, but also a realist. There are other projects with a better roadmap when it comes to scaling.

Reasonably safe? That depends on if the interest rates are low enough. From 2009-2010 up until today, if you bought the S&amp;P on margin (50-50 equity-debt), you would have done extremely well. 
Personally I think it makes sense to use (a lot) of margin after a healthy correction. Say the stock market index drops 30 or 40% tomorrow. Then you double down and BTFD. Just make sure the equity buffer is sufficient so you don't suffer a margin call. And make sure you have an extra buffer for a further decline. This should be relatively easy with portfolio margin.
I borrowed some extra money from my brokerage to invest in crypto, at 1.5% per annum. Mainly because I didn't want to sell my stocks (because some of my holdings generate a 2% dividend) + generate good capital gains. Given I can't be crypto margin called on that, and I have plenty of equity in my brokerage account (won't be margin called there either), I'm pretty comfortable with doing that. Of course my crypto investment could go in the red or to zero, but that's a risk I'm willing to take.
I also think my example is a reasonable approach to taking on debt, as opposed to people investing in crypto on a credit card at a 10 or 15% interest rate.

Using some leverage in a portfolio might not be bad. Just don't use margin debt for your crypto investments, where prices can move 10-20-30% in a day.
If you want to use debt, get a loan that at least can't automatically be liquidated.

Party on me if Bitcoin goes 20x from the previous ATH, however, I very much doubt that. Things don't grow indefinitely and while I can see the crypto market grow as large (if not larger) than the .com bubble, I don't think that will be immediately during in the next cycle.
But what do I know? Maybe the mania will lose their minds again, just like they did in 2017.
