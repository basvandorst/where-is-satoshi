I'd say that is less harmful but opinions may vary

Learn about \[whatever you want to invest in\] before considering that question.  
The price/buying time is the opposite you should be asking.   
Questions like what can bring it down, why does it/does not work, how does it work and who works on it are all valid questions to which you can find answers here and other places.

Listened to it the same day it was uploaded, but not on Youtube.  
I'd say almost everyone who knows about it did that.

It's polarizing that's a sure thing. Not everyone would taste the joke and perhaps others would not think it's a good thing to have when you're building up again trust. We'll see how it goes.

What's this, peterepeat68?

Is 5 days all it takes to flip flop?

That's 90% of my portfolio.Fully agree with OP's "in a nutshell" story.
I've already been called crazy for straying out of indexing.  
Give it 5 years.

Please expand a bit. I'm trying to learn, no hate.

As it is, TSLA + BTC, we should still have 1-3 months expenses saved up.  
Unless you don't need to pay for your living.  
Call me old-fashioned but it's not fun for something unexpected to happen and not have a little bit of money to cover it.

Man, fact check and stop spreading the Russia story. It's not valid.

Is Coinbase using anything like a fractionary reserve system?  
I understand no BTC can created outside of mining but can they allocate their hot/cold storage in larger quantity than they have into custodial wallets? It's known that ppl transact only a fraction of their holdings, hence the system works in fiat.

Thanks for the answer! I've started using a hot wallet and all my holdings (small) are there now. I control the keys, I can confirm the tx, it's all good.  
Regarding  *high risk of hacks, confiscations, capital controls and even exit scams* \- How is this possible if they control their own keys to the hot storage and most of it is cold storage? Capital controls, I can see govts doing that on them so I understand. Exit scams, ofc, it's non zero chance but.. Coinbase?  
Thanks again.
