Litecoin is an altcoin. This topic is abougt how stupid altcoins are.

You pay per byte, so it all depends on how many inputs and outputs there are tied to a address. It really boggles my mind how in this sub most people just type stuff that is technically completely incorrect. 
What you said was technically correct for Ethereum but not for Bitcoin.

Nothing, hashpower follows price. If BCH and BTC have the same price the hashpower will be 50/50 
I was talking about signaling, which is not the same as mining on both chains.

You think a blockchain is just a secure database?  How do you convince millions of people to run a blockchain without giving them a financial reward?

The good thing about bitcoin is that the coins never really lose value, you can keep transferring them around and you never loose out. Best money in the world. Well except for like very high fees everytime Roger Ver spams the network.

It you don't believe that Bitcoin can scale on chain then you believe Bitcoin was build wrong. If you do believe that Bitcoin can scale then you are with Bitcoin-BCH. Bitcoin-BTC is what blockstream wanted, Bitcoin-BCH is what the community wants and even the miners signalled 80% support for Bitcoin with a blocksize higher then 1 MB. Blockstream hijcaked the project and now everybody and their mother are developing for Bitcoin-BCH. The market sees his and once the market price flips Bitcoin-BTC will be detroned and Bitcoin will become free again. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 07:16:14
BCH removed replace by fee and without blocks being full 0 conf is still safer then Visa and payment cards.

This it not true at all.

You think Bitmain is going to attack BCH? 
@_date: 2018-06-07 05:17:45
What about transactions fees and wait times going up so much in 2017 because core devs refused to increase the blocksize to prevent congestion? Does that not change the economics of the system when the cost of using the currency can rapidly go up and is unpredictable because it depends on how much the network is used? 94% of the network is running core software, should that not be decentralised?

Does this wallet FINALLY allows us to also receive payments? 
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:17:48
Alpha or beta? Why not launch on mainnet? Can you  receive payments with your wallets? Merchants need a wallet they can receive payments with!!!! 
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:07:29
That would explain why nobody on the BTC chain has attacked BCH yet, because Bitmain controls both chains. We need a POW change and we needed it yesterday. Jihan controls everything right now. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 04:35:37
To expensive for most people. Not everybody has that much Bitcoin. It's better to Hodl and wait for the LN network to become adopted, then tx will always be free. That would be nice, Bitcoin has never had free tx. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 05:27:16
BTC.com has 25,7% hashrate on the Bitcoin network.
Antpool has 15,9%
ViaBTC has 8.9%
BTC.TOP has 8.9%
That's total hashrate of 59.4%](
These mining pools are all under control of Jihan [as you can see here]( because they all mine Bcash. 
[is right to be concerned about a 51% attack on BTC by criminal Jihan. 
Now that Bcash is such a failure (even LN is used more then Bcash) you can be sure that Jihan is going to attack Bitcoin, because he hates it. Even if that means he will be the end of his mining and ASIC business.
All this talk about LN is a distraction, right now Bitcoin's biggest threat is that 60% hashrate that Jihan controls on the Bitcoin chain.

This was one of Satoshi's big mistakes, to make Bitcoin open source. Now anybody can steal the Bitcoin brand which damages an entire industry.

You are 5 years in the past man, you should explain here how to run a Lightning Node. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:07:14
Tell them to buy Bitcoin because mathematically speaking it will go to 1000 0000 0000 000 CAD per Bitcoin. Tell them they are retards if they don't do it and never to  trust evil chinese miners. Then will be very proud and might even open a LN channel with you if we can figure out how to do that. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:41:23
Well yeah just look at the damage Roger Ver is doing with btrash. All because of Satoshi making these dumb mistakes. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:42:04
If Bitcoin can be abused that easy then it's not really decentralised and will fail. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 06:42:05
Yeah I was going to invest in bcash but this sounds like a better deal. Sign me up. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 00:08:17
Nobody really care about the Lightning Network, it's a nice coding puzzles for devs but there is hardly any demand for it right now. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:55:25
- Removing the soft block size limit completely (the one that was added in 2010 and changed to 8 MB in august 2017). The max block size will now be the original 32 MB that's in the P2P protocol. Higher is possible but required the P2P protocol to be rewritten (which has already been done a long time ago but won't be needed in the next 10 years)
- OP_RETURN data carrier size has been increased to 220 bytes allowing for more non transaction related data per transaction
- Old OP_Codes that bitcoin-qt team disabled will be re-enable giving bcash some of the functionality that originally was going to be implemented on bitcoin, like simple smart contracts. 
But it does not really matter what happens, there is like 20 people running Bitcoin Cash nodes and nobody in the world is using it. So who cares. Here at work my boss is working hard on supporting LN so I can get paid over LN. It's not working yet, but we are making progress. The demand for LN is insane. Everybody wants LN because LN has the best devs, everybody knows that. It might take a couple of years to complete the tech but then LN will be able to do billions of tx a day which will mean the end of paypal and visa and fiat money. Finaly the dream will come true. Bitcoin prices will go to million dollars per coin and I am going to never have to work for the rest of my life.

I don't really need TOR but just out of principle I am going to buy a subscription of of them and pay using the Lightning Network.  Can I just download Eclair Walled and I am good to go? 
@_date: 2018-04-05 00:38:55
No, when LN runs out of capacity after hitting the 1 mb block limit again we can create a second one. The number of LN you can create is infinite, that's why it is called Lightning Network. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 00:16:43
I know right! It feels like we are back in 2011, the excitement is coming backing, this is so great! Now we work forward again! 
@_date: 2018-04-05 00:49:30
Good, I feel like I want to spend more of my Bitcoin now that prices are going down.

On storage being a possible problem for onchain scaling Satoshi said


And also: 






On bandwidth he said: 


for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.


would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. 
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.


sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal. 
On latency he said: 




new blocks and transactions it has. The neighbours request the
items they don't have yet. If the item never comes through after a
timeout, they request it from another neighbour that had it. Since
all or most of the neighbours should eventually have each item,
even if the coms get fumbled up with one, they can get it from any
of the others, trying one at a time.


it ultimately helps speed more by keeping extra data blocks off the
transmit queues and conserving bandwidth.
So now you show me the quotes about Satoshi being in favor of off-chain scaling proposals because he believed that the 1 mb limit was for any other reason then the protect the network from flooding in its early days. 
Because a 100 GB of bandwidth per day translates to about blocks of 350 MB big and was pretty clear the the limit would go up when needed, but that never happened even when it was needed. 
Cause your argument right now is similar to not building a car that can do a 100 km/h because a 1000 km/h would be impossible and so they end up with a car that does 10 km/h. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 18:59:44
Satoshi came up with the name Bitcoin and he was the one wanting to scale on chain, so I would say that Bitcoin Cash deserves to be called Bitcoin since all the fork did was restore the original way of scaling on chain.

That is a lie. It was never a secret 
It was put in place to prevent network abuse when the first 4 years 10 million coins where mined at low enegery costs and when Bitcoin hardly had any value. To prevent trolls from making the blockchain grow to fast in the beginning.
Now this can't be done anymore without burning through a shitload of money or all your valuable bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 19:34:29
You can't know if there is consensus or not in a community that was centered around bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.org when all of those places are heavenly censored. So you remove everything and everybody in support of the original Satoshi idea and then it looks like there is a majority that wants to go in the other direction.
