What do you feel is missing?
@_date: 2018-01-01 09:29:24
The thresholds in scalability are (currently) not storage space, they are a matter of bandwidth and more specifically upload speeds and latency. 
Yes buying a 2TB hard drive would keep you personally going for a while, but on-chain scaling at such a pace would effectively cut out a large amount of the nodes that help to keep the network decentralised and censorship resistant.
You also misunderstand what Bitcoin Core developers are trying to achieve here (and somehow assume they're not aware of high fees?). Developers are not as interested in achieving "price goals" and you should be VERY happy about that. If the goal is only to get the price as high as possible, then they will always cut corners and overhype everything.
Bitcoin Core developers want to build sound technology that will change the world in the long term. Scaling through quick-wins on-chain each time people flood the memory pool with transactions will not hold out. We need permanent scalable solutions and the Lightning Network will begin to help us in that direction.
@_date: 2018-01-02 07:39:23
That would get very subjective and it would probably not be possible to still cover all aspects of the ecosystem.
If there’s enough demand I can do it.
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:47:18
My pleasure, you too!
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:48:12
It’s a win-win situation, those who are interested get a summary and I stay on top of my game.
@_date: 2018-01-01 09:56:49
It will require fees, so recently there was a new breakthrough posted of having Lightning upon Lightning layer, which would eliminate most of this. Granted it will take time to build.
Yes people will leave, because the tech can’t keep up with the pace of adoption. The primary goal of Bitcoin is censorship resistance though, it should not try to cater to many of the new people who onboarded and insist on all having instant near free on-chain transactions. That’s a losing battle which compromises everything else we’ve built up.
The developers are definitely interested in UX, within the realm of what is possible to achieve for them. By switching to 16MB blocks or whatever, you embark on a permanent path you can’t turn back from. A bad call will permanently screw you in the future. One of the aspects of that step is cutting out all Tor nodes, providing full transparency on where all nodes are hosted.
What do you think will begin to happen to Bitcoin when its market cap is in the trillions, it is challenging central banking and there are only a few hundred nodes left, most of which controlled by for-profit companies under government pressure?
Show me the data that proves it would cut out almost nobody. It sounds to me like you haven’t ran a node and you’re just assuming everyone is in the privileged position you are.
If you’re upset Bitcoin doesn’t make you enough money, by all means go to another cryptocurrency with bold claims that will run into the same scalability challenges. If it was as simple as changing one parameter, it would’ve been done long ago. Have a little faith in the people that brought us this far, they are working tirelessly.

Having privacy is difficult, if the average user has to constantly think of extra steps to achieve it, many won’t bother, and in return reduce the privacy others have.
Andreas is not necessarily advocating to only go with the solutions we know of today. He’s advocating for work to be done to include privacy into the base layer, which may include technology that has not been invented yet.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:17:36
The story is that they wanted to start an ASIC-resistant Bitcoin to fight miner centralisation.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:32:41
Correct, I believe work on Schnorr and MAST were even held off to wait on whether SegWit would go through.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:31:34
Not that I know of.
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:00:56
Hi quick, it’s a good question and a realistic threat. That would work under the assumption that only they would ever include their own transactions, which isn’t what happens in reality. It would make the attack cheaper for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:41:06
No, because there is more demand than supply for honest users. There would be more of them using Schnorr to try to get in on blocks and spammers wouldn’t have that advantage.
So for the same average fee you would previously have e.g. 1000 honest transactions and 1000 spam transactions in a block, and with Schnorr 1250 honest tx vs 750 spam. If the spammer wants to get back to 1k, he’ll need to overpay on those 250 transactions while the user doesn’t need to do that.

For those curious when we will see this in Bitcoin, Pieter Wuille posted he expects a BIP and Implementation in 2018 
@_date: 2019-07-02 17:26:36
Happy to hear that ��
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:20:47
You’re right, messed up my time machine settings 
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:33:15
Mostly correct, but if your transaction was previously 1kb and now 0.5, you could still pay as if it were 0.6 and outprice the spammer per byte, who is now forced to pay up to the 1.2 level to compete, while you still save money. 
It is a subtle difference, but adds up long term, as well as making it obvious what the spammer not using Schnorr is doing.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:24:32
The numbers are dates, as listed in the beginning these items are per day.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:50:23
Not as far as I know, I thought the 2 are unrelated.
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:23:58
Pay a higher price referred to more transactions required to claim blockspace.
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:09:06
I believe Pieter Wuille said there would be a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal this year, not sure when though. Edit: next year 
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:47:41
Me neither, which is why wallets would need to be smart enough about it and do it for the user. They would still pay a lower fee than without it.
It’s not at the top of the fun engineering list, but we’ll eventually need every measure available to combat spam as it will occur at any blocksize.
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:34:37
True, it’s a double whammy
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:22:15
Because they would take up less space and ultimately pay a higher price.

@_date: 2017-12-29 14:10:59
I know you didn’t mean to, but at the same time understood this may not be clear to others, hence the extra explanation! 
Thanks, you can count on it ��
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:31:04
I haven’t discovered any personally. You could argue that because it is opt-in like SegWit transactions, it may not save us as much space as we’d like.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:29:16
Increasing them by x% would be guaranteed more expensive, as the only way to do that would be to overpay on others. In the long term the more opt-in optimisations we have for honest actors, the more it will cost for malicious actors.
The analogy with SegWit is correct, and many people have been paying lower fees by using it. 
The article states “helps solve” and not “solves” though. It’s not a permanent solution and doesn’t do the full job, but any help is welcome imo. If people are consistently sending transactions with loads of signatures, it will also become much more apparent in the long term that they are spam attacks, as any sane person would use Schnorr + SegWit.
Spam attacks would also be an issue at larger blocksizes so we need anything we can have to combat it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:40:28
Bored out of my mind tbh.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:34:19
Probably the same replies I got when I initially posted the article, along the lines of: “a 25% optimisation is a joke, we need x times the blocksize today, stop wasting time on this”

It is easy to make an analogy based on cherrypicked characteristics. Don’t forget that religion is responsible for many of the wars throughout history. I think you’ll find Bitcoin rather peaceful.

Yes I know what the site says and the failure rates, but I also wrote: Yeah I said "if", but we also have to realize that the internet of money is here to stay, in one form or another.

Unless you think paint is design level, I'm not a designer. :P I do agree that these things make people think that way. It was intended as more of a way to make people understand this is not just a currency and we're not just about money. So to me it wasn't about marketing, but about understanding.
@_date: 2018-05-01 15:07:42
My vote would be no. The whole point of this post is to not look at the price for a second and consider all of the other awesome things that happened in Bitcoin, whereas the daily discussions are usually mostly about price.
@_date: 2018-05-28 08:42:10
You mean the cure is spreading.

Lol if it was the second. :P
@_date: 2014-04-02 20:27:39
I'll have to disagree there. Apple hardly advertises their products because they don't need to. Their focus is on providing products the way consumers want them to be and they do that so well, that people do their marketing for them as they believe in this ideology.
In that sense, Bitcoin can be similar.
@_date: 2014-04-02 21:58:37
Like me for example. I bought a macbook pro over 4 years ago, it still runs perfectly fine and I've never had a single issue with it in 4 years. No security issues, no programs acting up, no blue screens, nothing.
All this time it has been completely intuitive, very easy to handle in every way and I've enjoyed every day with my laptop. I paid more, not for the brand, but for trouble free computer usage, something I know I will never get with a Windows (coming from someone who used Windows for over a decade, for the record).
I'm 100% convinced I could not have had this same experience if I spent the same money on any other laptop.
I also have no doubt that this same laptop could easily go on for a few more years at this rate.
Same story with the iPhone 4 I bought 4 years ago btw.
@_date: 2014-02-03 19:22:05
I appreciate your feedback Andy, though it seems like your story is much bigger than the one chapter I have to write about Bitcoin. Have you considered writing your own book?

If greed drives the world, why would greedy people get in on Bitcoin right now? It is uncertain whether it will make them rich any time soon, if at all. Bitcoin is also rather complex to most people right now, which means a lot of people simply won't get in on it.
@_date: 2014-04-02 20:20:33
Glad to hear it meant something to more people than just me. :)
@_date: 2014-04-11 12:47:06
Sheep being fed by the media I guess. I'm at a 30% loss or so, which would probably have worried me badly in anything but Bitcoin. I never questioned my investment and I'm just a student still.
@_date: 2014-02-03 19:20:15
Thanks a lot for your feedback. :)
It is indeed difficult. I wanted to keep it simple for any reader in the post, because in the end it's not super important for them to know if it's a key or an actual bitcoin on their computer.
As for the book, that's a good question indeed. Since the book is about Digital Transformation and how businesses are getting disrupted by digital, I want to include parts about how Bitcoin can be disruptive for other companies. I want to avoid too much stuff that gets outdated quickly (though that's probably easier said than done) and focus more on the opportunities it presents and the problems that it solves.
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:36:11
I can send you the article from any site ( but it would not have mattered because 99%+ of the people in this Reddit cannot read it. It is one that passed by one Facebook because a friend commented on it, that is all.

@_date: 2014-02-18 22:20:06
Yeah so the puppets thing I was referring to.. I was hoping there would be some other explanation as this one is just saddening. Thanks for sharing your thoughts.
@_date: 2014-04-02 20:24:42
That's great to hear, it's definitely more difficult as an early adopter since you did infact make money, people who bought above the current level usually didn't so they at least have that on their side. (although one might argue they're just saying that to save their ass in that case..)
@_date: 2014-05-01 15:04:12
Because companies have a management which can communicate to people as the company. Bitcoin does not have this. We altogether, are the only communication department and thus the voice of Bitcoin. In this age, everyone is reading online for reviews and comments about everything, the online image is actually vital to convince people of the worth of a product or software.
@_date: 2014-04-02 20:56:20
Their communication is pretty poor indeed and I agree that "it is a company that tells people what to want" is a better way to word it. At the same time, what they do provide is still better in many peoples eyes than what their competitors offer, who do communicate more with their customers. So they both fail and succeed at doing this in the end.
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:21:18
I never said that I think they give a shit about Bitcoin, I asked why they are so against it when it could benefit them a lot.

@_date: 2014-02-18 21:54:11
I just edited the post to add this: 
It's another solution, in case fees would ever be a problem.
Bitcoin is also still a far better way to do micro-transactions than anything out there as far as I'm aware.
@_date: 2014-05-01 15:10:55
I know it is effIcient, I use it myself. There is indeed more interest, but the world is not ready for Bitcoin and Bitcoin is not ready for the world yet. The Bitcoin community taking a hostile stance against other payment methods is not going to help it to become better, focusing on Bitcoin itself will.
@_date: 2014-05-05 21:32:59
I always liked it because it has more than one meaning, except for the fact that most of the world simply doesn't know Latin.
@_date: 2014-04-03 10:55:54
Personally I prefer freedom. It's not necessarily a democracy and we do have power, but that isn't the idea behind Bitcoin. We want to be free and have things in our own hands again, we don't want to be powerful and overthrow things necessarily.
Freedom is also something every human being wants, it is in our nature, while not everyone desires power.
@_date: 2014-04-03 10:52:50
Yeah it's great and that is indeed what it is about.
@_date: 2017-02-01 19:14:27
Still looking, preferably something related to education.
@_date: 2015-05-18 23:14:18
I'm all for Bitcoin innovation, but I'm completely missing the point here. What exact problem are these chips solving for people? We've seen stuff like Segways, Google Glass, etc. fail, because they may be neat and useful, but they're not actually solving a problem or fulfilling a need of the people.
* The best argument for people I saw in here was cheaper devices for the poor. That's going to happen without these chips too. It is only a matter of time for phones to cost less than 0.04236 btc ($10).
* Mining is something the average person doesn't even know and if they did, they wouldn't care for it.
* The average person doesn't need to write to a globally accessible database, they don't care.
* Buying software or subscriptions is already incredibly easy, these chips are not solving that either.
* Getting access to internet is also not a problem these chips will solve. Google, Facebook or SpaceX will do this with their balloons/drones/satellites, in exchange for your data and to keep you in their 'ecosystem'.
Feel free to point out what I'm missing here, I'd love to understand how this company will appeal to the masses in the slightest way.

@_date: 2017-02-02 06:08:54
I was thinking of doing this initially, but the subreddit rules clearly state to not include too many links. The way I have it now already got the topic removed for that reason, after which a mod kindly reinstated it just minutes after contacting them.
I'll probably do this part in the archive thing I'll add to my site instead, or I'll have to message the mods each month to reinstate the post.
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:43:20
Of course it has bad news and I'm not saying they should no longer write about that, but they hardly ever write about any of the good and when they do write about the bad, it is very often misinformation that wasn't properly researched.

I've been checking every day for the last 2 years. Imagine the slap I gave myself when I only thought of doing this a month ago.
@_date: 2017-02-01 17:25:25
It didn't reach near the top of the posts at any point hence why it wasn't included (along with a lot of other things that were semi-interesting).
I also didn't include frequent updates on the % of nodes signalling for SegWit for example, because there was only one day (the 1st) on which people found that interesting.
I'd also like to avoid using this to recreate a lousy form of graphs (like adding the price each day, the amount of nodes,...). This introduces the question of when it is ok to add a % change and when it is not. Do you do it every 2%? 5? 10?
@_date: 2017-02-01 17:37:45






@_date: 2017-02-25 17:12:38
It is if you're a speaker about it, I've had so many interested questions just over the laptop alone. The chances of those devices getting stolen are high enough to begin with if you let people, the cover doesn't change that.

Nothing is up yet, I'll let you know when it is. (some time this week, maybe today still)
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:53:17
I'm sure the graph can be improved, I just made it up and heard a lot of feedback today. 
5 years ago some people already realized that there was a physical limit to keep adding transactions on-chain. Today with more users, this has become more apparent. Bitcoin couldn't have gone mainstream and handled billions of users then. Perhaps in the minds of users, but not in the technical reality.?
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:51:21
I don't agree with the approach of blocking and making demands like I said above, but that's where we are right now. Bluntly telling them they can't do this won't help us progress, which is why I want to at least open the conversation.
On an unrelated note, what is your favourite memory about mining if you feel like sharing it?
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:47:49

Late welcome! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.
@_date: 2017-02-23 11:39:54
If that was the reason, then we'd have an even bigger backlog at the start of 2017 when it went over $1k, yet we didn't. 
There's literally proof out there someone is sending the same transactions to themselves over and over again. That's not organic demand, it's manipulation. 
You know better than this Olivier.

I don't see how it is the opposite. Not kicking the can down the road means scaling now and dealing with the consequences of that later.
@_date: 2017-02-01 17:29:31
I'm glad you ask, thoughtfan (appropriate name).
I find the scalability challenges extremely interesting, but I think they were heavily discussed on literally every day of the month (I'll add a note about that in the post). My goal was to create an overview of news that happened throughout the month for those who missed things and nostalgia reasons, not to get people to argue on here too.
I'll correct the mistake, thanks!

Hi ferz, I read about it in [this topic](
Which linked to this website (volumes below the graph): 
There's a lot of zero-fee trading there as well, so it's possible that the US is now  and Japan or China  I guess it's not verified enough to include in the list, it was simply a popular topic of discussion that day.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:54:12
Awesome to see this get so much attention. To clarify: the goal of this scale isn't to point out who is right or wrong, it is to help create understanding. Not everyone on the other "side" is evil, so never resort to generalising them, like we see at the extreme ends. Remain patient and respectful, I have hope we can come to a solution that way.
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:29:01
It was explained to me that they weren't Jihan's words, but something he quoted.
I'm not drawing a false parellel + dichotomy. The post has nothing to do with the short term. Some miners are concerned with 2nd layer scalability happening eventually and are not in support of SegWit for that reason, not because they don't like SegWit itself or think it is bad for the short-term.
In the post I talk about the long term future, where exclusively scaling on-chain will not get us to global adoption. I'm sure I could've worded/visualized it better in hindsight, but I don't get this kind of feedback until it is out there.

I've seen dozens of comments bringing it up as an alternative solution to SegWit in BU, but perhaps they were all poorly informed and thus I am too. I'll have to find the needle in the haystack of a developer mentioning it, unless my memory is failing me.
@_date: 2017-03-04 00:01:08
I never said all of them, you're the one generalizing.
If the free market had the technological knowhow to make the best decisions that maximize the value of Bitcoin for everyone, I would trust it too. Unfortunately reality has proven that most people don't understand Bitcoin well enough to truly understand what gives it value and how that safeguard it. The market is divided because everyone is educated about it in a different way.
@_date: 2017-03-04 08:49:19
I want to trust miners, but not to have additional control over the rules in the form of BU. I'm also not saying Bitcoin Core should decide alone. Miners, developers, exchanges, nodes and users all need to have a say. 
If I really had to pick one group it would indeed be the 100+ developers, because they have proven over and over that they fundamentally understand what gives bitcoin value and how to safeguard those principles. I prefer collaboration though.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:21:32
Thanks, I was hoping so. We need to create more understanding for each other and less fights. It didn't get as much attention from people on the right axis as I had hoped (I posted it [there]( too), but I'm sure many will see it here.

I know they do, but they'll have to manage expectations. If your slice of the cake is too large, one innovation or the other will eventually cut piece by piece of it away. It's an appeal to think long-term.

Alongside SegWit there will be other on-chain scalability improvements (Schnorr signatures is one example that can reportedly save another 20-30% of space). As our global Internet infrastructure scales though, the baseline of the network will increase and even the most conservative developers will be willing to follow that. In my eyes there is a zero % chance that developers will stop making Bitcoin scale once LN is live and payment channels become outrageously expensive due to adoption. On-chain scaling is inevitable, but when it impacts the decentralisation of the network, it should be avoided if there are better alternatives.
The problem with BU is that it gives too much power to the miners, who (as you explained) primarily want to maximise their profits. Their interests will largely align with users, but in some ways they won't. An example of this is not adopting SegWit so we can't scale off-chain for cheaper and faster transactions (as explained in my top post). This would mean that miners would ALSO block Flexible Transactions, even if BU became the dominant client, because those would enable the Lightning Network too.
It is in their best interest of miners game the system and centralise it. Giving them that power is irresponsible and risky. We want a super stable base layer, not one that can shift frequently based on votes.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:46:19
The problem a lot of people on the right axis have is that SegWit ≠ Lightning. SegWit is a step towards Lightning, which does't mean Lightning is ready to launch today, while they want a solution today.

I never said bitcoin doesn't need to scale right now, no clue where you're getting that from. 
It's easy to compare Bitcoin to a company in some ways, but companies have (alongside a board/CEO) departments and clearly defined roles, ownerships, processes, targets, no competing implementations,... while in Bitcoin all of these are loosely defined. It puts us exponentially behind in terms of co-operative efficiency. That's your answer to the initial question of "why aren't we doing better".
My problem with your post is that you see "the market" as one big group, which it is not. You assume that everyone in "the market" will equally evaluate all options in the market, which they won't, because time, interests, expertise, etc. There are a lot of people that only trade stocks, because that's what they know and are good at, while others exclusively seed fund startups as they know how those work, while never looking at investing in gold or oil, even if those seem more profitable.

Transitioning to a different PoW should be a plan, no matter what. Obviously, their attitude increases the urgency of doing it. But anyway it doesn't seem like hashing will spontaneously re-decentralise and it will become even a larger problem.
I think it's fine to have a different PoW as an extreme last resort, as long as it is communicated clearly that this would only ever be used in the event of a minority chain attack.
I think it would help if we had more manufacturing decentralization and perhaps if this keeps being a problem, someone may jump in and fill that gap.


Thanks for the smile back :)

So if miners mine non-full blocks with a lot of transactions waiting in the mempool, that's in the best interest of users and makes them trustworthy enough to be the *only* ones with a say in the rules?

I'm sure it's a bit inaccurate, it's not exact science, just a scale I made up. 
Bitcoin isn't the same thing to everyone, and developers have indicated they want to see Bitcoin as P2P digital cash as intended by Satoshi, without risking the decentralisation of the network. It is possible for Bitcoin to be both, so we should try and make it there to make a real difference in the world, rather than "saving" those who found out about it in time.
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:32:58
Well I'm working on that. I've been creating monthly recaps of whatever interesting stuff is happening in Bitcoin. You can read the recaps for [January]( and [February](
I'm working on a site for it and want to go back in time too, but haven't had time to do that yet.
As for SegWit, it is an upgrade that fixes a longstanding bug in Bitcoin, which has several side benefits, such as creating more space for transactions in blocks and enabling a host of future improvements. One of these may be a permanent solution to the scalability challenges we have (The Lightning Network). People are going crazy over SegWit because it is the only thing that is ready to help us scale today, but it needs more miners to adopt it. Users and businesses have already shown they really want it, but there is a group with a different view of how we should move forward. They want to allow miners to take the lead in the scalability of the network, which many people do not want to see. As a result, we've come to a stalemate for a while now, which is escalating the situation. We all think we know what is best for Bitcoin but have different views of how to move forward. (the scale somewhat shows this)
It's fine to be *that* lost. The EU said they don't want any anonymous cryptocurrencies (like Monero), but Bitcoin in its current form is ok-ish to them as they regulate the exchanges and map as much of the ecosystem as possible.
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:27:31
I cannot give it any more credit than my common sense and all the things I have read from the developers over the years. They are coding for Bitcoin every day and understand the technical limitations very well. 
Core developers are not against blocksize increases, or they would have never agreed on SegWit, which is a blocksize increase too. They are just very conservative about it, to protect the network.
Perhaps it would help if you spoke to a core developer directly about this? I know that Eric Lombrozo is very [accessible on Twitter]( Maybe he can give you more answers.
Thanks for your time and trying to bring us together :)
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:27:20
It wasn't my intention to make it sound stupid (and I still don't think it sounds stupid, I think it sounds responsible). Preserving decentralization is in my eyes dealing with the consequences of scaling up.

We all decided that Bitcoin is a currency, despite the majority of the money in the world saying it can't be. That's because money doesn't give you the rights to a word or concept in a decentralized world.

Big blockers aren't, but miners clearly are. Even if BU went through, miners would block Flexible Transactions according to this, so users are now actually united around something if they all want LN.

With consequences I mean the centralization/decentralization of the network. If we scale right now through BU, we may harm the long term decentralization of the network as it will largely be out of our hands and more in those of the miners.

Not necessarily, there are solutions to creating full privacy in Bitcoin, they just need to be developed. The developers are fully aware of this and consider it the most important problem alongside scalability.
Thanks! I'm not really up for giving financial advice, but if you want to buy it to hold it then consider it a long term investment (years). In that case you likely believe Bitcoin will succeed and it doesn't matter *that* much at what price you buy in. If you're not too sure if Bitcoin will succeed, then it's best to keep your hands off. Either way, don't invest anything you can't afford to lose.

The miners also broke their part of the agreement. If we keep dwelling on the past we won't get anywhere now. I hope it's a lesson for people to communicate better in the future and not have a handful of people on each side decide on the spot.
Edit: Some of the miners involved
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:52:35

This has nothing to do with programmers and your misconceptions about the interests of a group of 100+ independent developers. It is entirely about whether we can fully trust miners to be in control, regardless of who the other stakeholders and their intentions are. If you have to trust one of many potential evils, that's not particularly a trustless system is it?

Getting Bitcoin "to the moon" is hopeful thinking as a whole. If people assume that we can't risk scaling off-chain because we may never truly scale, then Bitcoin as P2P cash will remain a very niche thing. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:55:46
I disagree. Mining is a fine idea, as long as miners hold an "equal"  place (this is heavily debatable I know) in the ecosystem alongside users, exchanges, nodes, developers. If we can all keep each other in check we'll have slow change, but good change. If we give too much power to any group, then we get problems. That's why some people don't want BU, because it increases the power of miners in a way that is in their best interest.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:01:09
You would also see a lot of other miners punished for it. I wouldn't get too excited about it.

Interesting to hear, what made you think this one was worth upvoting?
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:59:29
The visual is about the logic, not exact numbers. I made up the percentages to prove a point, which is that scaling for a global market has more benefits for miners than keeping it "local". On-chain we simply cannot scale for billions of users, unless a bunch of other miracles happen. Exclusively relying on those is not a good path forward. We need both on-chain and off-chain scaling in the long term to make this a success, and this post addresses Jihan's (and other miners) concern about ANY off-chain scaling.
@_date: 2017-03-29 11:47:02
Thank you for sharing your insights from Weibo &amp; Twitter.
I agree we need a plan B, but I don't think blocking plan A is a great way to motivate people. 
The sooner we can get Plan A through, the sooner we can find out how good it is and the sooner we can start increasing work on alternatives if it turns out we need to.
We already know today that the Lightning Network at 1MB blocks won't be enough to cover mainstream demand, so we will definitely need to do on-chain scaling. ALL developers realise this. However, the longer we can hold off blocksize increases while letting the global infrastructure catch up, the healthier that will be for Bitcoin in the long term. 
A plan to increase the block size can be made very quickly, but since developers don't know what the impact of the Lightning Network will be until it is live, making any promises or setting anything in stone about blocksize increases right now isn't practical. Anything that gets proposed as an idea now will be twisted into a promise and held against people later on, so people don't want to make those kinds of proposals.
I understand that miners want to guarantees because some have lost trust in the developers, but this is the practical side of it. I think miners should trust that developers won't run Bitcoin into the ground if Plan A doesn't work. Developers are devoting their time to Bitcoin freely, they want to see it succeed too.

This is a great example of why we shouldn't blindly trust that the best interests of miners are *fully* aligned with users. 
The primary interest of miners is (logically) with their business. Where possible, they will make decisions to first and foremost benefit their business (such as being first to mine a block even if that means leaving transactions in the mempool), even if users aren't entirely happy with those decisions. 
It's not like we're going to take action against mining pools that are leaving out transactions, or against a bunch of them centralizing nodes through bigger blocks, and they know it.
These seemingly small strategic plays are the precise reason  why I do not want BU to happen. The interests of miners and users will largely align, but it's this small space where they won't that I'm deeply worried about.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:32:38
I'm sure, yes. It's just that if we have to temporarily give up for it to be as effective as cash, to eventually make it cash in the best possible way, that pain may be worth it over the alternative of it not working out in the long term.
@_date: 2019-03-06 20:57:44
Happy to hear it BitcoinFan!
@_date: 2017-03-18 19:10:18
BU would allow miners to gradually push through the blocksizes they prefer. This in turn would push the network towards centralization as less and less nodes are able to deal with larger blocks. In the long term that would make us end up with a more centralized Bitcoin than we want to have and miners would become more powerful, which isn't needed for anything in my eyes.
@_date: 2017-03-04 00:15:03
What you're saying is, "we should trust the lesser of two 'evils'", instead of finding another solution. To me that's not a feasible option, hence the whole argument.
I'm also unsure why you speak of eggheads, considering my last remark. It is nice to hear you're an expert on CVC though.
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:59:18
Yes their mining strategy is to ensure the blocks first, transactions if possible. This will get ironed out eventually by optimizations such as Fiber by Matt Corallo. Miners know this too, so they expect to always have transactions in their blocks in the future, no matter how fast they mine them.
@_date: 2017-03-19 07:52:19
The right extreme isn't exclusively people who oppose censorship, but those who blame it on the core developers and the investors in the company of some of them. I agree with you.

@_date: 2017-03-29 12:12:32
I agree there are many misunderstandings. Thanks a lot for trying to be a bridge and sorry for the negative replies and downvotes you're getting from some people.
By the way, you can quote people on reddit by putting &gt; and then copy paste their message. Like this:


I understand that they feel like this is the last chance, but I don't think it is. Like I said, core developers understand that 1MB blocks will never be enough if we want Bitcoin to go mainstream. It would only allow a small amount of payment channels on the Lightning Network. They all know we need to increase the blocksize through hardforks one day, but they would rather do it once the Internet is much faster across the globe so that we don't lose nodes on the network.
Of course my thoughts are not enough to convince anyone, but maybe you could write a letter to the developers, together with the miners you know in person? In there you could clearly outline the concerns you have, so that we can open a civilized conversation. At minimum the miners would understand that (most) developers don't want to stay at 1MB forever, because they understand the limitations of that too. I think that would help.
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:20:41
And your topic here is very constructive I think. 


That's a good question, hence why I posted above "Of course my thoughts are not enough to convince anyone". 
I think if you would directly address the developers, you will find out soon enough if they think like I do. Some won't, which is why you need replies from as many as possible. Don't let 1 or 2 fanatic developers make you believe all of them want to stay at 1MB forever.
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:44:12
I agree that the picture will give people strange prejudices, but we all communicate in different ways. Give it a shot and read his conversation with me, it makes it easy to understand the miners' point of view, even if you think they are wrong. They simply want some more guarantees because they have hardware investments in this, I can't blame them for looking for that and not blindly trusting people across a language barrier.
@_date: 2017-03-21 08:18:07
I agree that it's totally self-regulating, which is something miners should understand given the juggling they have to do with their operations based on the bitcoin price, energy prices, mining difficulty, competition,...


They will be able to provide much more liquidity than many others, so should technically benefit a lot from this indeed.

Bitcoin is not a startup, it doesn't make much sense to compare the two, no matter how compelling it seems.
Snapchat built something on an existing platform (smartphones and their already heavily used cameras), for a young audience that switches and adopts more easily. 
Bitcoin addresses many concerns of generations that are partially towards the less digital savvy side and slower to adoption. 
It's about developing a protocol in a decentralized way, versus developing an app and business in a centralized way. Huge difference.

I don't agree, if I follow your suggestion then I make the whole right side look like conspiracy theorists to a lot of people and it wouldn't look neutral at all.
I also don't think it is what the rectangle would say, because it is the point of view of both sides. The left things hardforking now is shooting ourselves in the foot just as much as the right thinks not doing it is.
Ensuring there is a future first = dealing with consequences later.

They have "control" as the setups are permissioned and they are the ones issuing access. If the technology is capable there is (as far as I see) indeed no point in anything privately controlled, because they would want the neutrality and security of an open blockchain, as well as the development power involved.

I don't know what banking problems they were, so I'm not going to assume or judge there.

The Lightning Network is a separate transaction layer built on top of Bitcoin (the first layer). The goal is to achieve much higher transactions per second at much cheaper rates.
MAST is an improvement to smart contracts which will increase possibilities for them.
SegWit is a malleability solution, or did you have specific other things in mind?
The question I usually ask is, should non-techies have to understand what all these terms are, or should they understand what they represent? With that in mind I made this presentation a while back to help non-techies understand how developers are trying to improve Bitcoin. Maybe it helps out a bit: 
@_date: 2016-11-04 13:18:31
Ok, well I'm not one of those people. 
I did not say anywhere that it is a good idea to create a private blockchain. I only stated that I get why they are doing it, because (surprisingly) even that is better than what they're messing around with today. They don't even have one centralized database across any supply chain today to begin with, all data is in silos. Even an incredibly inefficient private setup may be better than that.
The only useful/logical application of the blockchain I believe in today is indeed P2P currency, everything else is a big question mark to me.
@_date: 2016-12-19 18:41:07
You're basically contradicting yourself in the above. If you assume all bitcoin miners are good with computers as that's their business, then you should also assume they are good at thinking long term, as their investments are made for and pay off in the long term. 
If that's true, then miners understand the long term advantages of on-chain scaling, which includes both SegWit and 2MB or more. To me that is a clear sign that not all of them oppose SegWit by itself and that their interest isn't in short term earnings, but in helping Bitcoin as a whole grow. 
Some of the miners appear to think the best way forward for that is a hardfork to 2MB or more, which has nothing to do with overcharging, as it decreases income in the short term. It has to do with the long term possibilities to scale on-chain, the fear that we'll stay at 1MB forever and only scale off-chain for the rest. 
Some of the miners seem to want to see proof that on-chain scaling beyond SegWit is not off the table here, which makes complete sense from their business perspective. A certain limit to on-chain scaling would peg their potential income to the amount of people still willing to do on-chain transactions, instead of it being pegged to the growth of Bitcoin as a whole.
My point on the alignment of interests was about priorities. The first priority of a pool operator is to keep mining operational, something that could be challenged in a lot of unexpected ways. (broken hardware, shortage in experienced staffing, external inspections, power issues, maintenance,...). The first priorities of users are having their money secure and being able to send it quickly and cheaply.

Yeah it's mostly the competition thing. 
I think the main reason why they bother trying to build their own is to have it exactly the way they want it, but a lot of them do build on top of existing solutions, I didn't word that very well.
I don't agree with their approach (I agree with you), but the post isn't really about that, it's about their attitude towards using an open blockchain in the future.

As others mentioned, I wouldn't really go in detail about it at a family dinner, but if they insist to understand and you don't want your family to think you're delusional for the rest of your life ;) here's some ideas:
1. **They can't get over the idea they can't hold/touch it**: A large amount of our money is already digital, right now it's simply being held on the computers of banks. With Bitcoin, you hold the money on your own computer, so you don't have to completely trust a for-profit corporation with your money and to decide reasonable rules. Right now cash is being phased out across the world, our payments are being increasingly done digitally, plastic cards will disappear over time too. Even without Bitcoin, they eventually won't be able to hold/touch it. It's a logical evolution, change is just difficult for people.
2. **sending of money to long user- unfriendly addresses to be a bit overwhelming**: **SHOW THEM**. Pull our your smartphone, scan one of their QR codes and let them to see the money transfer in real-time. That blows any arguments out of the water. Additionally you can show them a simple address book in one of the wallets, or something simple like a Coinbase wallet link.
3. **the fact that no one can understand the open source Bitcoin code makes them not trust it.**: Your family probably **uses the Internet every single day**, without fundamentally understanding how it technically works. Still, **they trust it** with their personal information, sending of money, pictures, private conversations,... **ask them why**. If they can't give you a decent answer, you can explain to them that nobody is in control of the Internet. The rules are created and developed by smart people from all over the world and then made publicly available for people to review and challenge. Changing those rules is very hard, as it requires a large democratic vote to change them. This is still hard for people to trust, but you need to give them time to let it sink in. With the Internet the threshold was low, if your information gets stolen, it sucks but most people care less. However if your money is lost or stolen, that's a much bigger deal to people and they will be far more reluctant.
Hopefully that helps a bit.

You can have consumer protection, or full ownership of your money, not both. According to your logic, consumer protection will be the bigger issue in the future, I disagree.
I'd argue it's generally the unexperienced shoppers who get scammed. They don't understand how to (quickly) check the reputation of a shop and these likely won't be people using bitcoin for their (first) online orders.
In e-commerce we've already seen a large evolution where the trustworthy stores have far more to lose by 1 complaining customer on social media, than by issuing a refund. We live in a world of increased transparency and legit businesses understand this risk and social pressure.
Yes there will still be fraudulent purchases, but that's less than 1% of the cases I think (no data to back this up), whereas far more than 1% is going to have issues with not truly owning their own money in the future.
@_date: 2016-12-18 14:06:57
The primary focus of the topic is understanding, which can potentially lead to adoption, but doesn't need to. OP wanted his family to not think he is delusional, for which you don't need your family to use Bitcoin. They only need to understand it is useful in certain circumstances, some of which may apply to them. If explained well, you put the choice whether it is useful for someone else in their hands, instead of telling them what they should do.
@_date: 2016-12-18 09:31:21
If you explain to people that have no clue about Bitcoin that it's biggest problem is the blocksize and it can't handle more transactions, that's counter productive and way over their head. It's like explaining to someone who has never heard of VR that you may get motion sickness from it, irrelevant information at that point in time which only makes them more reluctant to learn anything about it or try it out.

I think posts like these are a result of the average Bitcoin user not being aware what the stance and progress of a lot of miners is on SegWit. If miners are testing and upgrading to SegWit, I would imagine it is in their best interest to communicate this well with the broader community. I've seen some pools (like Slush) do this, but for the most part I've seen nothing (could also be me).
Do miners communicate well with Bitcoin developers what their current progress on upgrading is? If not, do you think they should? Do they ask Bitcoin developers for help in upgrading?

I know, I simply think explaining things like cold storage and paper wallets upon on introduction overcomplicates things.

He's now at the point where he did state it and thus if he doesn't want his family to think he's delusional, the alternative is making them understand. 
When someone brings up that they are having a financial problem and you may know a way to help them solve it, I don't think that's being obtrusive. Your situation was different, your obsession didn't solve a problem someone brought up to you at those family dinners. ����

I understand your reasoning. For me it is not much more work to make the judgement call each time, because that's how I do it. I've never had fraud issues when purchasing anything online, hence why I've never seen the need for using a Credit Card for purchases. The key however is to not assume everyone is like us, so I'll leave that argument aside.
I still think the amount of people affected by not owning their own money is vastly larger than the amount of people that may get scammed because they can't charge back. I used to think about it the way you do, but if you look at the evolution in transparency we've gone through and will continue to go through, I expect fraud to be less of an issue over time.
I have no doubt that people will continue to build and develop escrow services for Bitcoin, with indeed a cost attached, though I don't expect this to ever be a standard feature. Therefore people are given the choice to use it or not. Nobody is forced to use Bitcoin, it is an alternative for those that prefer autonomy over insurance.

I've thought about the things you wrote in your post a lot as well, as someone who creates his own "marketing" through slidedecks and presentations. I think when people search for it, the content absolutely needs to be there. However, until we get to the point where Bitcoin can scale and have privacy, I don't think it's a good idea to try to advertise it to the masses. Perhaps only to those people that need it the most, like the Venezuelans you mentioned.
I do think it is a good idea to create a strategy on how we could reach people as soon as we do have scalability and privacy. I think a lot of people expect this kind of stuff to be sorted by sites like Bitcoin.com though. 
I'm up for talking more about it if you're looking for people willing to help.

I do realise that, but like I said, there are plenty of cases where there isn't even a centralised database to begin with. The blockchain seems to be a way for them to open the discussion and start doing things, like social media, smartphones and the first wave of tech startups created ripples that initiated conversations across all industries to work differently.

Edit: pointed out my mistake below, thanks!
Since transaction fees have been rising a lot over the past year, I decided to look into it because I didn’t feel like we’re doing *that many more* transactions than a year ago (18% more on average). There are almost 5 times as many transactions in the mempool on average and yet we somehow pay 11x more in fees. How is this possible?
My only conclusion is that wallets auto-bidding up on each other means that we will always be paying heavily inflated fees from now on. It's not just about there being more demand, but about the fee estimation systems being flawed. Is there anything wrong with my logic? **Please correct me if I’m wrong.**
I pulled data from the past year from blockchain.info, calculated my own average fee per transaction (because they somehow don’t have this graph?) and plotted it out against the total transactions per day and average transactions in the mempool. If you want to look at the data, you can do so in [this Google Sheet](
@_date: 2017-04-17 13:48:25
Right, so if everyone thinks "hey, let's pay up", then soon we'll start paying above that. My point is that if we could in theory all sit around the table and say "we're all overpaying, let's continue $0.01-$0.50 lower", it would hardly affect the mempool. If nothing gets done, we'll all end up paying exponentially increasing fees even though there isn't much more demand.

I don't think the average user is going to understand that, we'll need to do better.
@_date: 2017-04-29 20:48:25


The general opinion seems to be that if we can avoid them and scale on-chain through softforks, that is preferred over backwards-incompatible hardforks. In the long term everyone understands that doesn't hold though, and we will eventually need on-chain scaling through hardforks. (unless other solutions come up)


I do think it will cause those problems, it simply won't be noticeable until we're already far down that path and can't return from it. BU allows very strategic minds with their own agendas to game the system. I absolutely never want to see emergent consensus happen. It trades long-term security and health to address short-term demand for an infeasible situation: $0.05 on-chain fees for everyone until the end of time. It's a startuppy/business approach in my eyes, not a global network of value approach.


Any actual code written for a future increase will only result in more people stalling and demanding that gets activated now, to Core being held to promises they don't want to make because they don't believe they lead to a healthy situation for the network. That's why premature agreements will unlikely work out.


Ask any Core developer if they think SegWit + LN will be enough until the end of time to reach global adoption, they will all tell you it is not, even Luke Jr. They understand the technical limitations of the network better than anyone, including how SegWit as a max size will never help us scale globally.

Whenever people tell me something about Bitcoin is too complicated, I ask them if they understand how the Internet works at a technical level, and why they trust it with their personal information, communication and money. Works 100% of the time so far.
As for OP's question, how will people use LN? Perhaps their wallet will give 2 options:
**Fast &amp; Cheap Transaction** (Lightning)
Instant transactions up to X | Low fee (estimate) | Good security 
**Slow &amp; Secure Transaction** (Normal Bitcoin transaction)
Slower transactions starting from X | Higher fee (estimate) | Maximum security
It doesn't take any degree to understand that, as all the technical stuff like transaction routing happens behind the scenes.
@_date: 2017-04-17 14:04:53


Call it what you want, does "unconfirmed transactions" slow down your heartbeat?


The amount of unconfirmed transactions around a specific fee is a decent indication of demand at that fee. I don't see how that is unrelated to the average fee people pay. Why do you think they are unrelated?


I left it out because there is still space to do more transactions per day. It's meant to help you relate to the other numbers.


I hope they will get better, do you know of any work on improvements?


I just worked with the data I could find, which is what is happening on the network. If more people combine transactions, that will show in the data, but I can't base it on some optimal situation which isn't actually happening.


Well the hashrate has trippled over the past year, the node count hasn't changed that much. It seems unlikely that we're paying 11x more for 3x better security, when the numbers show that we can actually pay less.

Well I took it because it is what happens on the network in the end. 
If I start to ignore special cases (no idea how I'd technically do it anyway), then the transactions in the mempool wouldn't have half of those spikes either, with all the weird chained transactions that happened at those times.

@_date: 2017-04-29 18:28:53
I don't think it's the best choice to base it on fee averages until we have an idea of how much pain LN can alleviate. Once we have more data we can make better assessments of what kind of correlation could work.

Where does it say/who says the idea behind bitcoin is to scale according to popularity? Of course everyone would like it to, just like we’d all like car transportation to scale so well that we never have traffic jams. Studies have shown that infinitely adding lanes isn’t the solution and would go at the cost of many other things.
In the infographic (assuming you read it) the Lightning Network is specifically listed as “part of the solution”, not a “saviour of bitcoin”.
Best of luck with that project, bitcoin will continue to do its own thing.

Hi Mauser, right now miners also earn the fees of all of the transactions in the block they added to the blockchain. In the future more transactions will happen. They will likely have higher fees as the blockchain itself becomes a settlement layer for many transactions at once. We already see this today with the batching of transactions and the setup of lightning network channels, which can handle many transactions before settling them once on the blockchain.
So it is expected and by design that in the future as the block reward decreases, transaction fees will pay for more than enough security to incentivize miners to keep adding transactions to the blockchain.

Without technological improvements, it's unlikely people would have taken as much supply off the market over the past years. SegWit is a stepping stone, not only one that enables future innovation, but also one that proved users are in control, which restored a lot of faith in Bitcoin for a part of the community.
Perhaps in a few years, a lot more people will know what the Lightning Network is, which could draw in new investors and hopefully, more people eager to use the technology for payments.
I'm not "supporting any price" by the way, just sharing my thoughts.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:30:59
Price comes and goes, but technology improvements stay. This price was partially made possible by tech improvements set in motion years ago. Right now the Lightning Network among other improvements are helping to bake in how the next few years may play out. Depending on the timeline you take, it can also keep getting better.
^ That's all fun talk when you're in the red, but if you want to change things yourself, the best way is by helping to build and improve Bitcoin. Otherwise if you still believe in Bitcoin's potential to change the world but are unhappy about the price dropping, it's best to be patient.

It really doesn't help to generalise the entire Chinese Bitcoin community because of a few bad actors. Just like people don't like it when Core gets generalised to a handful of developers that supposedly decide on the whole protocol, the Chinese Bitcoin community doesn't like to be generalised.

Thanks for the elaborate response (and your awesome work on Lightning!). I agree these kinds of smart contracts need some link to reputation to be usable for the average person.
Solving disputes does sound like a pain, in the early days the markets will sort themselves out by calling out scammers and fake reports (like today when people spread FUD), but it may hold back adoption as that grows out of control.
That particular edge case does not help there, sounds like a lot of risk for the potential reward at this stage if you have to forfeit immediate recovery for a bet. :/

What bothers me most is that people who use "Satoshi's Original Vision" to make a point, do so selectively.

@_date: 2017-05-21 12:23:02
"The markets prefer" means a majority, which would make miners stick with the more valuable coin due to slow difficulty retargeting. 
In the case of a hardfork, you can have the majority of miners support it, but if a minority disagrees and enough users stick with that minority, you will have a chain split, like we saw with ETC.
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:08:46
Agreed, but I don't think we should follow immediate user demand when it comes to scaling backwards-incompatibly. I would rather see us go through pain until we have an idea of what LN can do, than hardforking prematurely to keep a handful happy today that will be displeased again in a few months.

I don't think the post is bad, because I'm indeed talking about on average. 
If the top 10% can technically run nodes, great, but in reality you have to overlay the amount of people that use bitcoin, with above required Internet speeds, with the willingness to pay $800 per year in upkeep. That means you're left with a very small amount of people able to run nodes.

I'm sure I like it. 21 is shifting the money from platforms to users. 
Today if you want to reach people in a hyper-targeted way, you have to pay platforms like Facebook and then rely on people's goodwill to spend their time. 
With 21, companies pay people for their time directly, which is how it should be. This may end up being super attractive for younger generations that are generally hard to reach for brands, but don't have a way of earning an income yet.
This is huge and people are going to vastly underestimate the impact.

I do, though you can edit any of it. 
Either way, we don't have substantially more full nodes at 1MB today. If we were to go to 8MB as some people have been suggesting, I'm pretty sure we would go well below that 4000. 
I've seen some people argue that more users means more nodes, but historically we haven't really seen much evidence of that. I've mostly seen node count rising for BU and UASF, which is for idealistic reasoning. 
If the cost to run a full node goes x8 and we're hardforking to drop fees so less wealthy people can use Bitcoin too, I'm highly skeptical those same people will start making up for the lost nodes.

I'm also not asking for people who earn $2 per day to be able to run full nodes. I'm asking not to kick too many people off the network prematurely if we can first get data on how much LN will alleviate congestion, so we can scale on-chain more responsibly.

I didn't really want to turn the post into a guide on how to spam the mempool in cost-efficient ways.
I agree a very easy way would be to flood the network with transactions that won't get confirmed any time soon. Even the appearance of a bigger backlog makes people more inclined to pay more fees.
A new signature scheme doesn't eliminate it, I didn't say it does. It simply helps a bit.

What do you mean "that's just how it is" lol, don't flip on me now.
@_date: 2017-07-04 15:36:53
The supply is limited in bytes yes, but the bytes together form a transaction. Bitcoin does not split up massive transactions in different parts, either your entire transaction goes through or nothing.
So if you pay a high fee for your massive transaction, you instantly overtake many others. If you cannot make massive transactions, you cannot take out many others in one go and have to compete on a much more granular level, which is harder by definition.

As far as I understand they wouldn't be optional. The idea is to replace the current ECDSA signatures with Schnorr.
I think it is related because SegWit separates the witness data, which allows Schnorr to be implemented through a soft-fork. 
I'm not familiair with the OP_NOP redefinition upgrade mechanism, I'll have to look into that.

@_date: 2017-07-04 15:50:55
Hi logical, nothing stops them from using ECDSA, but those using Schnorr will have less bytes to pay for, driving up the cost of an attack.
I think if miners will block Schnorr for unclear reasons like they have with SegWit, it may show whether they were involved in the spam attacks at all.

Sounds like a fun idea, make sure you can buy alpaca socks in it. You can also turn the "Income tax" tile into Mt Gox.

The fact that it is an estimate is literally in the title "~"
Transfers to users themselves are still transfers over the blockchain and that is what this graph is about.

I wasn't aware it would impact time-locked transactions, thanks for pointing that out. Do you have any source to read more about that?
If it can't be mandatory it won't affect spam that much indeed. It does make it cheaper for regular users to send transactions due to having less bytes, so in that sense it does increase the costs for a spam attack.
I was under the impression the current Schnorr proposal specifically relied on script versioning or it would need to be changed up. Makes sense though, thanks.

This is a good question, which I should have covered in the post. 
Let's take the block I included in the post as an example, it had 78 transactions. In this case, in order to fill blocks with spam, you only need to out-pay the competition on a handful of transactions (in the case of this block, 16 of them), whereas if each transaction uses just one signature, you need to out-pay the competition on thousands of them to fill up a block. That is much harder to do and other transactions will more easily get included by paying a higher fee, which forces the attacker to keep bumping up their fees.
So in simple terms: You are competing with people that want to send transactions, not bytes. The more transactions you have to send to spam, the easier it is for others to beat some of your transactions.

Thanks for taking the time to explain tom, have a great day!

I should have included this in the post, you're right. It does make it difficult to keep things simple though.
As I replied to zwoelfenbein above:

It would be too much on the verge of an accusation and it wasn't my intention to make that the most discussed part of the article.
@_date: 2017-05-07 07:40:42
Here not so much, but in other places people post ignorant shit like "if it's layer 2 it's not bitcoin and I don't want it"

No problem, it helps me to stay on top of my game so it's a nice win-win :)

Thanks logical, I'm glad you like the posts.
@_date: 2017-07-04 15:34:33
The spammer can do that, but the other people now have reduced transaction sizes and have less bytes to try to get into blocks, thus raising the price of an attack.

Just trying to help out as a non-developer, thanks.

You are reading correctly, that is the "scalability" part of the post.
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:06:24
If you're into that boring conspiracy, how does them showing you their bitcoin holdings change anything about them potentially getting paid x times that in fiat?
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:12:07
All 3 can be a measure of the amount of politics.
@_date: 2017-06-05 06:32:04
Both are things on my to do list since I started these posts. I have some other projects and priorities I want to deal with first.
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:47:16
In my opinion, Bitcoin should not be scaled based on which mouth has the most money, but on what is the most sound technological solution given all the trade-offs.
The entire problem of the traditional financial world is that decisions are primarily monetary based, instead of what is the best thing to do.
If working on an open-source project forces you to disclose your holdings, it will only disincentivize the developers we badly need.
Either way, it's safe to say many of them have substantial holdings considering they found out about it before the masses.

Username checks out.
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:20:55
That's how it works for Blockstream employees. 
But they shouldn't have to do anything. Developers do not owe us anything, they are free to propose improvements to Bitcoin like any other developer, which the nodes will adopt or ignore.

Fixed it, thanks!
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:58:58
And your theory is that they spent thousands of hours to increase the value of their investment, to now completely ruin that work and legacy, for what exactly?
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:14:08
There is a link, but if you're on mobile then Reddit doesn't show it.
