Just placed an order!  FYI, I had to take the "ss" off of the mailing list coupon code to get it to work.  Looking forward to receiving the sampler pack!

Thanks!  Indeed, we got the idea from just yesterday and moved as quickly as we could to produce a sample we were happy with and get the shop up and running.
We absolutely accept BTC as payment (through Bitpay).  Our only restriction right now is that we're sticking to domestic US shipments for the first few days to make sure everything is running well before we add the extra complexity of shipping internationally.

He actually seemed relieved that we saved him the effort of making them for other people - and I never meant to imply that it was our original idea in the first place.
We saw something cool that people said they were willing to pay for, so we tried to make something people would want to buy.  The market for these is small enough that if were to sell them himself, we would probably end up differentiating the product further or not selling at all.

Thanks!  I just did.

Thanks to the OP for the inspiration - we ran a few prototypes between yesterday and today to perfect the process and are ready to manufacture and ship on demand.
Available for $89 (or BTC equivalent), with a black anodized finish on all surfaces but the polished face.

I can guarantee that the guy who polishes the front side pays much better attention to detail than I do.
Thanks for the catch  :-D

I don't see why not!  Anything that can get QR coded (with the exception of some of those really high-detail image overlays) should be possible.
