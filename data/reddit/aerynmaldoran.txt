What information does LibertyX actually require? The FAQ mentions name, address and dob.
When you use LocalBitcoins, do the banks ask for ID when depositing cash into people's accounts?

Abandoning, already uninstalled it from my phone.
What I loved about it was that unlike exchanges I could keep a USD balance and either send to a wallet (through a mixer) for storage or send out payments as needed. I know that gives up some privacy, but that way there's zero chance of capital gains.

I've been using BitMixer. Haven't had any issues with it and I can spread it out to different wallets with different fees and time delays.
I supposed I have to go back to using IRSbase, so I think I'll try doing shapeshift-&gt;Monero then use xmr.to to go back to btc when needed.

I've been wondering this myself. I loved Circle since I could just keep a USD balance, send some BTC to storage every paycheck and make payments directly converting USD-&gt;BTC so there's no capital gains. I didn't want to go back to IRSbase.
I gave LibertyX a try recently and was happy with it. Price was slightly higher than Coinbase and I had to pay $3 + 1% when purchasing the PIN, but it was easy. I only had to confirm my number through text. $200 limit / day. Also what's nice when you redeem it you give an address and it sends it there, I used ShapeShift to get some Monero.
Another option, which I'm going to try soon, are ATMs. There are three within a two hour drive, though it looks like two of them have an 18% markup (fuck that). I have to actually go to the other one to see it's fees.
There's also Mycellium local trading. I'm going to do that soon. Meet up with someone in person and exchange cash for BTC.
There's also Localbitcoins but that tends to have a high markup, but you can just deposit cash into someone's bank account and get BTC. I've considered trying that but I'm worried the bank might scan my ID like they do when I put cash (rolls of coins, mostly pennies) into my own bank account.
Paxful looks interesting, but has a really high markup.
