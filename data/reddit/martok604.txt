I did look at Greenaddress but found several issues here and correct me if I am wrong. For my private key, I cannot generate that on an airgap machine, never to be connected to the net. I at some point am asked to enter the pneumonic into the greenaddress app/interface which is connected to their server. So I don't know that isn't being sent with a transaction. Further, though it might well not be sent, a future code change could send that key. My private key wants to be generated offline on a machine that never sees the internet in its life. Next issue with greenaddress is the nlocktime. In order to get a nlocktime, I have to send the address coin and trust that GA is going to create a release TX. There is a gap between my sending the TX and receiving an email with the unlock data and as the service is 2of2 rather than 2of3, it is not appropriate for serious amounts.
Bitgo is 2of3 which is good but it holds two of the keys, bad. It might as well be 1of1 at that point. The closest service I've found is trustedcoin but that uses a delay rather than a 2FA confirm. But delays aren't secure either, compramized key while on vacation well that's that.

This is a reasonable question, the answer to which is almost certainly that Coinbase or whatever exchange would simply go bust leaving depositers out of luck. I'm guessing Coinbase investors have bondholder status in the corporation so would get paid out after employee salaries. Do depositers even have legal rights in the case of an exchange collapse? I'm thinking not.
One solution I would like to see is the major exchange getting together and forming a corporation into which funds are pooled and from that depositers are insured against the solvancy of member exchanges. Coinbase, any chance?

Unless I am misunderstanding 2of3 multisig, the three private keys need not be shared. That is, bitgo for example only needs 1 key and not the 2 it has and likewise for greenaddress. If I am wrong here then what does multisig offer if you have to trust the wallet provider with your private keys?

How possible would it be to import an electrum seed for deterministic key generation or an MPK for a watch wallet?

Do you support multisig transactions where seller and buyer and potentially yourself would sign off on a transaction? I don't really like storing my coins in startup web wallets where security is not yet proven.

this. It doesn't look like I can generate the two user keys with say pycoin offline and upload the bip39 encrypted key to coinbase. If they enable this, I will be using it. Until then, there is a risk that my browser is compremized when generating the key.

I would not trust Breadwallet for larger sums on a device that can connect to the net. There is no way to know that the software doesn't transmit the private keys when the phone is connected. Breadwallet is open-source and that is a definite plus but there is no way to know that the version on github matches the version in the app store unless you compile it yourself The only way to securely store large amounts is to generate your keys offline and have those private keys never touch an online connected computer.

According to the post, their website was encrypted so the attacker was unable to do anything with root.
Unless they were running a hardened system say using SeLinux and doing it properly which is not an easy thing, there is probably a breach here. Root may not have direct access to encrypted files but he does have access to server memory, communications between server and backend etc. I would be very surprised if theft doesn't happen if it hasn't already.

I've been trying to add the sx utility to my offline bitcoin USB stick and am nearly there. Does anyone know whether sx will be able to sign the CoinKite transactions? It looks as though it can generate the keys without much trouble. Any other console options? I don't trust the browser.

I wonder if we'll be able to short this ETF. IE buy bitcoin from an exchange and short the ETF to hedge the price risk of owning BTC.

My problem with this is Bitstamp's transparency. What exactly are the civil forfeiture laws at play here. Afaik, the US is the only first world nation where assets can be seized without a court conviction. Questions for Bitstamp I have yet to see answered:
To what authorities will the funds be submitted? Is this for unpayed taxes, a civil settlement, what exactly?
Law supporting such seizure?
Bitstamp should not be showing BTC from unverified accounts on its own books as assets. They are custodial accounts held for the benefit of a third party.

Thanks for this. I didn't realize two signatures were required here. I will hopefully be able to put some scripts together for this. It would be helpful if the scripts to be signed could be queried with the CoinKite API but no matter.

Here's some. According to their email headers: localbitcoins.com real IP (the one behind cloudflare) is 144.76.120.56. That melongs to yourserver.de (de = germany). In otherwords, their server is located in Germany.

Couple notes here but take this with a grain of sault as I tend to be more paranoid than most.
If you are using a 2/n setup, coinkite should only have one key. Never enough to create a transaction on its own. The fact that they don't store the password is irrelavent to you the end user. Their internal security measures are essentially a black box to the outside and need to be treated with care. From what I've discovered so far, CK have given every indication that their service is trustworthy and on the up and up. However, could a rogue employee inject code into the backend to steal the passwords and keys as they go over the wire? Absolutely. So coinkite should have only one key.
Second: generate your bip32 keys using a service other than Coinkite's generator. Again, this isn't about Coinkite's trustworthiness, it's about risk mitigation.
Here's a good read on planning for disaster when it comes to Bitcoin storage:
The ideas don't cover things like Multisig but the principle of distributing your key or keys through Shamir's Shared Secrets is a good one and prevents the social engineering attacks mensioned in this thread elsewhere.
Coinkite has built a great service here. Quite possibly the best web wallet around. However we need to use it with caution and be sure we are not exposing too much information to the site.

I've seen multisig done on several other services now. In each case, the keys were either generated in browser, stored encrypted on the service where they "say" they don't keep the password or have some other flaw where it would be possible for the service to obtain the key. This is the first I have encountered where I can do key generation completely offline, no browsers, no javascript and the service never sees the private key. Very well done!

There are plenty of accessible bitcoin clients. Electrum from the console works just fine, as does bitcoind using commands as someone else pointed out. IOS bitcoin apps are quite accessible, I have personally tried greenaddress and breadwallet and they are accessible if not very secure.
Alas, where we could use some accessibility is with the treasor and like devices. Very cool tech but alas one needs to see the codes coming up on the displays.

Right so how do we get on this list of preferred fee users? Right now it is much cheaper for me to wire to Bitfinex, BTCE and bitstamp even from Canada.
@_date: 2014-07-30 00:06:27
Does it have a console mode? I would be using this over electrum if I could script around it.

Probably because the site owners are based in Germany. They would actually be forced to follow German and EU AML regs if doing business in their own nation.

blockchain is really no better than any of the others. If your machine is infected with malware, it would be trivial for the malware to scoop the private key along with the passphrase when it is entered. Once yu have the private key, you don't need to worry about 2auth. That is assuming the private key is stored on your computer and not on blockchain servers. It has to be stored somewhere.

Will Trezor ever be able to be used by a blind person? It seems the interface on hardware wallets is very visual right now with pin maps etc. I get that you can't just pass the transaction details back to software as the software could be compramized. So an audio output port (headphone jack) would seem to be the only way. Is such a thing just too expensive to contemplate at this point? Are there likely to be any hardware wallets usable to someone without vision?

Just discovered this wallet and definitely the best I've found yet. Couple things I wanted to ask:
Can I display the master public key to create a watch-only wallet on the PC via electrum? Their BIP032 support is 13 words but that is just a 0x01 prepend I believe. Is BreadWallet electrum compatible?
Any chance you would permit an offline mode where the iPhone would act as a signer. I could do electrum mktxx, put that in a qr code and BW could scan that code and output the signed transaction which I would send to the network myself.
Currently, I am using electrum in offline mode from an USB stick in combinttion with an online watch-only wallet and hoping BR could replace the offline portion of that scheme.

So we can generate the keys with pycoin:
ku create
ku -s 1 xpub...
to get the keys at whatever level we want.
That's good because I looked at the OkCoin JS generator code and can't say I would trust the math. All of the encryption stuff appears to be obfuscated, though the code using it toward the bottom is readable enough.
Signing appears more tricky mainly because the file coming out of Coinkite is basically html inside json. I think I'll just wait for an API as that will make getting and submitting signature data much simpler.

It is somewhat concerning that in order to have a security issue addressed on Coinbase, the reporter needs to post to Reddit and not the appropriate Coinbase forum. It's clear from other posts here that Coinbase was aware of this problem but it's ultimately a popularity contest that determines whether it will be fixed. Shame on you Coinbase.

So reserves will be fully audited? Will they be audited by a major accounting firm? Will funds be held in a trust account inaccessible to all employees save for tether redemptions? Will that trust account be administered by a reputable law firm? If not, I think I'll take a pass.
