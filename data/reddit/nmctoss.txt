Do not send this "company" your Bitcoin, they will most likely never ship anything.
I paid for a single order on May 22nd of 2013 and have yet to receive a single item.

Well tell him to hurry the fuck up with the shipments then...
I am waiting on an order that I paid for May 22nd of 2013!

Me too.
This company is the BFL of the online food supplement world.
I paid $65 back on May 22nd 2013 and have yet to receive any of it.
They keep responding to emails with gems like this:


That was sent to me 2 weeks ago...
In other words... "We have so much product being produced right now that we don't have the time to ship it to you... even though it's over 1 year late, soz!"
Edit: 1 year late, not 1 week late :/

Hah, I ordered in May of LAST YEAR and have yet to receive anything from the soylent company.

Because their product is now vanished and no longer exists.
I am waiting on my order since May 22nd of 2013 and have yet to receive it.
