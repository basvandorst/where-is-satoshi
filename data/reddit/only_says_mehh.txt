Great idea. But the point that many are missing is that the puzzles that are solved computationally while mining is what actually helps keeps the transactions' integrity across the blockchain. So it's not just superfluous mining as I understand it and is functional. A more valid comparison would be comparing it to the entire work that operating a bank takes with the systems that enable cryptos to work. End of the day I don't know what to think of cryptos either.

Whats the transfer fees like these days? Let's say for transferring BTC worth $100 can someone recommend an approximate fees based on speed of transfer?

What's the fee like if Im willing to wait for a day for the transfer to happen?

Oh okay. Thanks!

Lol just noticed that..he may be incorruptible.

Ah okay. I was checking out the transaction which got me the btc in the first place. Yes, there were plenty of confirmations. Very interesting stuff! Was actually reading about how the mining happens. :D Will check out the block explorer.
So is it enough if I store the multibit private key offline or do I need to keep the wallet files backed up as well? Of course, I'd back it up just wondering what would happen if I lost the wallet files but have the key safe. 
Anyway, thank you for the responses! One last question if you know, what's the recommended fee to set? The fee seems to be quite high so I'm wondering if setting a smaller fee and being willing to wait for a few hours for the confirmations will work?

I'm using version 3.0.0 
Btw, I dont remember having any seed words created during multibit classic wallet creation, just the private key to the wallet. Is the seed word idea implemented relatively recently?
And I just managed to successfully open a wallet in Electrum using the above method. I did it by opting for the "Import private keys/bitcoin address" option instead of "Standard wallet." How do I check if the btc is correctly imported? The balance showing is correct.

Nice but you really don't lose much if you sell 1/99th of what you have right? You'll at least get back your initial amount. What are you thoughts on that?

Hmm. Looks like I made the same mistake too. Well, the private key I have is 58 bit encoded. So you're saying only if I decrypt it would I have the actual private key. Anyway I think this is the correct one since the multibit wallet has the option to export the unencoded private key and also, the exported file carries the warning that anyone who can read the key can spend the btc as well. So that's clear enough. 
Whew, the amount of detail thats gone into this system is incredible. Really wondering if Satoshi is a single person atm lol.
