Definitely forming a base around this [level]( See my [previous post]( about significance of this level (magenta and cyan lines).

There's a interesting scenario for long position right now. Lower cyan and magenta lines plotted from daily to 1 minute chart. Large support here.

They work as support because last time the price was there it refused to go lower, hence "price was supported there". Same way straight lines work as resistance near the highs. More info [here](

Not to say GOX doesn't skim, but my guess is that what happened to you is known as slippage in "traditional" trading (stocks, futures, FX, etc.). Meaning that the liquidity at the market is not succifient enough to provide executions at the exact price that your order was set. This often happens in a case when there is a rapid move (i.e. large buy/sell order) and/or event/news driven volatility which causes large number of executions in short period of time.

Interestingly there has been quite low volume for the past ~40 days. I dropped around 22th of Dec and picked up again yesterday. See [here]( and [here (only difference is no mask)](
