You mean to tell me that is too busy victim shaming to care about the higher ups? 
Sounds like a normal capitalist fueled society to me.

Wikipedia is pretty cool. Thank Jimbo.
Also love the photos you put out for every fundraiser, gives us all great times. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 16:18:35
I just downvoted you because you are a fucking moron who has added nothing to the conversation but empty lies and a base for an eventual witchhunt. 
Who decides what is "thoughtfully critical"? Who decides what is a "negative post"? Are you the police now? 
Nah, you're just some high-horse child. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:15:11


you havin' a giggle m8? TARP/ The Fed are not related to the FDIC by that much. Of course, I'm under the assumption by saying "bailouts" you are both implying throwing money into a broken company to save them because of their importance, but also that covering ONLY depositors up to 100K (and for a time 250k) is also a bailout. 
I mean, can you at least make some coherent post that shows you have an idea of what you are talking about instead of sprouting digits like you're a nuclear scientist.

Back in my day, success was making money, not a market crashing and then saying that made it successful.

Take this to r/fiction, there is no need for your religious statements here. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:08:37
Banks paying premiums?
I mean, you can argue that "hurr banks get it from overcharging fees to consumers" and shit like that, but it's from banks. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 14:40:10
Welp, here comes the crash. Time to use r/bitcoin tactics and buy high and sell when it crashes!

This adds absolutely nothing of value and is only "le epik upboat :DDDDDDD " because fedora wearers love to hate on the government. The title is itself a blatant delusional statement.  
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:34:16
And of course the white people on get instantly butthurt and try to justify their ability to get bitcoins. 
Just because you're blind doesn't mean you have a privilege, then again this place is filled with morons who buy high, sell low, so it's not like there is much knowledge in here anyway.

@_date: 2014-03-26 18:29:13
If you get income, you get taxed for it. I am not sure how fucking difficult it is for r/bitcoin certified economists to understand. I guess certification has to be toughened. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 16:21:53
People get extremely defensive, and it's pretty funny to see the wail around like a beached whale fanboy protecting the white knight of bitcoin while trying to attack those who see issues with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:28:11
God damn, r/bitcoin commentators are super anal today. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 00:27:46
TO THE MOON. 
And people were making fun of speculators yesterday, but this guy is a positive towards bitcoin, so he's obviously right!. :^)
@_date: 2014-12-23 17:58:50
of course bitcoin.com doesn't work, the coin it's based on doesn't even work after losing half it values LOL

And yet, if it was the opposite, i'd be fully ok with letting my own money be taken so you would not lose your money (to a certain extent of course.)
WAIT A MINUTE, isn't FDIC paid by the banks through insurance premiums? Oh yes it is, so technically I guess you really wouldn't lose your money.

Perhaps he can use this bitcoin to buy better writers for his shitty jokes

Nice damage control, marketer. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 16:35:47
I remember when r/bitcoin would get mad at capitalists getting involved. Now they all see it as some sort of right of passage for bitcoin, haha.

Oh, and r/bitcoin has a hardon for seeing all people suffering, so there's that as well.

lol keep telling youself that. At the end of the day I'd rather have my money back thanks to the FDIC than this "muh bitcoin free market" bullshit that you are telling yourself. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 16:33:36
You mean to tell me a company is trying anything they can to mine as many bitcoins as possible before it comes cost-prohibitive?

There's a reason people are paid big money to come up with statistics and analyze them for trends. 
Of course, you can always go the route this website took and just pull shit out of your ass and come up with some retarded headline/conclusion that adds absolutely nothing to the conversation at hand, and hope some poor sap from r/bitcoin will link to it and give free pageviews.
