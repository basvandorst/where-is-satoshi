Wouldn't it be easy to check the blockchain for all transactions that have a timelock on them and output them? If there are any large transactions with timelocks, it should be easy to get a list.
However, I see here: 
"Starting around 2013 time-locked transactions were made non standard and no longer enter the memory pool, thus cannot be broadcast before the timelock expires."
So is this even possible?
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:45:19
There are several solutions here:
1) You keep arguing the case about a different response to whoever loads the URL, yet that is so easy to detect it's laughable to even consider. And, they could just post a hash of the file to the blockchain or some other secure location after it's published, so that everyone can verify it wasn't tampered with
2) 1 BTC quantization? And 1 million accounts with coins in them? Let's be real, it's common sense that most accounts out of that 1 million had no BTC balance, and 1BTC quantization is extremely low.
3) Even if it was 64MB of data uncompressed, third party services would be able to verify for you. (Blockchain.info?) Just supply a list of hashes that belong to you and ask the third party service for the total balance, easy. If it doesn't match what you know you have, then that's a red flag.
Most users rely and trust third party services anyway. There are no ways to explore the blockchain *locally* at this point for the general user. This would be the least of worries, I hope we can agree to that.
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:40:32
I don't understand why you keep saying that they can give different people different lists. That makes no sense.
They would publish the lists once every night let's assume, AT A PUBLIC URL. You would not need to authenticate to see it, and it can be downloaded and stored on third party servers to check for any coverups.
Where is the log? I've only seen  
EDIT: You keep defending your solution, yet you failed to say why the tree approach is any better. They could serve different data there as well, in addition to the other flaws it has. I'm willing to apologize for wasting anyone's time if that was truly the case here.
EDIT2: Ok, found the log.

This doesn't publish individual account balances, please reread.
Users don't receive different data, the same data is published for everyone and is available as a static file that you download. A sha256 hash of the balance snapshot file can be published to the blockchain for tamper verification purposes.


This doesn't matter, you're only interested in verifying whether the total associated with your hashes is correct.
For verification of the entire balance book, you'd just download the entire file straight from the source and verify its signature, you would not use a third party service.

Perhaps they never existed in the first place. Easy enough for them to make an account with 20 million dollars in it and start buying to push the price up, get media exposure, etc, then try to make it back from fees.
Perhaps some of that BTC never existed either, because of the same reasons.
Always struck me as odd that back in 2011 when they were hacked, the hacker could make an account with an arbitrary amount on BTC in it from their backend and then dump it all. 
Why would there even be such functionality coded in the backend?

Greg, please be rational and try to keep an open mind, this comment above shows you're replying instinctually without giving things much thought:
Various solutions here:
a) If balances are listed sequentially in the file, you only need to query for the first hash that belongs to you, say "satoshi1" in the example. The 3rd party API would return 100 rows from that starting position, and the client side verification code would take the shard # parameter to figure out how much you have. *Without* disclosing much information other than one particular hash, which anyone would have access to anyway just by looking at the file.
b) The site could tell you a rough starting position in the file where your hashes are located, with a random +/- variance for obfuscation. You can ask a third party service to show you the balances in that range (start=1200&amp;limit=100) and check yours. Simple paging.
This isn't even about negative balance, it never was. It was about simplifying this solution tremendously and making it harder to fake. You'd be able to check your balance in an exchange at any historical point in time, just by retrieving copies of this file from any of the mirrors surely keeping copies of it.
**It would provide a verifiable, historically recorded, proof of funds even if the exchange disappears.**
**OR** The two solutions could coexist, the tree for fast client side checking, and the public list for in depth analysis and record keeping.

Not necessarily, it could be their BTC fees being exchanged into fiat.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:14:15
That was just one way to game this method, [but there's also this one](
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:30:36
I haven't checked the code, but what stops them from adding fake users with negative balances? 
I'm assuming this algorithm doesn't somehow magically disallow negative balances, so if they wanted to erase 100k, they can just add a fake/hidden user with -100k balance. Even if you'd disallow that in your particular implementation, the algorithm itself is probably susceptible and can be modified to do that. After all, you're only publishing the root hash.
I might be wrong, but has this been taken into account?

Edit this into your post, higher chances of it being upvoted.
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:45:44
From what I understand from here:  it says the exchange doesn't have to publish the tree, just a hash. Publishing the tree reveals the # of accounts, as it was asked at the very end, but gmaxwell said that's not the case.
Edit: I reread it, and it does say something about publishing data about all intermediary nodes between the user and the root, but it's easy to put the negative balance user at the very end of the tree, so that it is not between any actual real user and the root.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:11:26
Yeah that doesn't make any sense.
I summed the balances of all the addresses given and it's actually 4083 BTC. [See here.](
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:05:06
I understand what you mean. Yes, it would be caught by certain users at the very end of the tree. 
However, a malicious website could use an adapting system which would put known inactive users next to these negative balances at the very end of trees. And, if they unexpectedly log in again, recalculate the entire tree and move their negative balances near other inactive users. No? It would be a lot of gymnastics to get right, but I think that if there's a need, there is a way.
@_date: 2014-03-12 12:17:48
In theory these could be their BTC commissions that they were exchanging into fiat. They were making thousands of BTC per month, so it makes sense to not keep all of it in BTC.

@_date: 2014-02-26 22:27:46
You're correct, it wouldn't matter if you add a negative node or just modify the balance of a known inactive node. There may be a way to detect if balances have been tampered with however.
Would it make sense to publish balances *for everyone* on the site in a file that concatenates the hashes of the account id with the balance of every user on the site?
It could be a long list of hash(accountid+balance+salt), published every day, so that everyone can check whether their hash appears in the file. 
Doing this would make it risky for them to alter balances even for inactive accounts. 
The only problem I see here is: I'm not sure if there's a way to correlate this file with the hash of the root of the tree, so that it can be verified that it was generated from the same data.
However, this would only verify that they don't tamper with people's balances, negative balances of fake users would still be untreaceable.

I really think the only real solution here is to publish the whole tree publicly... There are potential weaknesses to every other approach.

Technically they're addresses, but the usual terminology has been hot wallet/cold wallet when talking about internal addresses of exchanges.
A person/entity can have more than one wallet. I doubt those two cold addresses are linked together in a single wallet, so they're technically still separate cold "wallets", even if they're just a single-address wallet each.

Well, the fake user with the negative value could be outside of the private tree of any customer, at the very end of the tree, in a separate branch. It can easily be hidden somewhere without being noticeable, especially when thousands of users are involved.

The purpose of an exchange is to facilitate trades between its users. It wouldn't be ethical for the exchange to trade, because they have information about the balances and trading habits of everyone and they could use that for insider trading. 
They can theoretically also inject trades right before massive selloffs, if they wanted to - which can be well hidden by the massive lag these they were always experiencing at those times.
Unfortunately, there are many ways an exchange can benefit from unfair practices.
However, selling off some of the BTC they're making from fees would be acceptable...
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:53:23

There is not a lot of volume right now, orderbook is pretty thin, so it's still extremely easy to push the price into much higher highs. It only takes a 600 btc buy at current market prices to double the price at the moment... Which is not a lot considering the amounts being traded on exchanges, so I believe that once big fish figure this out, they're going to see a good opportunity.
A different company (ASICMINER) which traded on stock exchanges reached 2 million BTC market cap at one time. Here's a reddit post about how a $6k investment turned into $1.2m at one point:  . They went as high as 5BTC per share afterwards if I remember correctly, probably even higher.

@_date: 2014-02-26 23:05:55
I'm going to post this here since I think it's a better solution and far less complicated than this approach:
Instead of a tree, why not simply publish the balance of every account in one big list with some steps to obfuscate the number of accounts and how much each person holds.
Say "satoshi" has 1000 btc, you just split those 1000 btc into a random amount of entries, say:
hash("satoshi1" + salt), 100
hash("satoshi2" + salt), 150
hash("satoshi3" + salt), 150
hash("satoshi4" + salt), 600
That would make guessing the number of accounts impossible, and the site just needs to show you your account name, salt, and how many shards you have, so you can calculate the total sum.
It would also be public, static, and without any need to be separately generated for every single user.
It has many benefits over the tree approach, and is not susceptible to the flaw of fake accounts with negative balances, or known inactive accounts being zeroed out to hide fractionality.
Is there anything I'm missing that would make this approach unusable?
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:13:51
If those people are insiders/co-conspirators which keep quiet, or other fake accounts, then this approach doesn't really work...
Say a conspirator has 1000 BTC in his account, he's put at the very end of the tree with a fake -999 btc user, the parent sees 1 BTC to his left and thinks everything is ok. This system can still easily be gamed.

Your point one is off because gold is not a limited supply and is inflationist as well. 
There are around 2500 tonnes of gold mined each year. Adding around 1.5% to the global pool of gold every year, hence inflating at that rate.

By the word truly I meant that it's an artificial number just thrown around for fun and doesn't really mean anything. It takes just $4.7 million to demolish the economy back to $1, should someone have 311k bitcoins to insta-sell. 
Not arguing here if that would be a smart thing to do, it wouldn't, but if say, a government already had millions of coins on hand from the early days, they could do it just to wreak some havoc.

This. +1
I hope that Bitcoin can still be fixed if it gets mainstream, a rate of 1.5% inflation per year would be on par with world population growth and be around the same as the inflation of Gold. (2500 new gold mined every year, 170000ish tonnes in world vaults). We just need to educate the community about basic economics and agree to remove the hard cap. Hopefully it's not too late, people are pretty brainwashed by deflation being a good thing and not really thinking about the whole picture. 
Luckily, we still have until around 2024 before the inflation goes down to under 1.5% per year, so there's still time to fix it.

It's simple really, most people are thinking inflation is so evil because it has been abused by governments, but deflation can be a lot worse.
**Consider this:**
In a limited money supply of just 21 million coins, as population grows, and education improves there's more competition over the currency pool, so eventually everyone will be making less and less coins over time as their wage. Example: 7 billion people compete over 21 million coins today, but 20 billion people will compete over the same 21 million coins in the future, etc
That doesn't necessarily mean that their purchasing power drops because prices will drop at the same rate.
What it does mean however is that you can know for sure that prices will drop all the time, so instead of buying a house or car now, you can wait a couple of years and buy a better car by doing absolutely nothing productive yourself. 
This will harm production even if only 10% do it, resulting in a collapse of the economy and lots of people ending up jobless. With a deflationary currency, growth stops eventually. Hoarding, to some extent will happen. Even saving a tiny bit each month **will** make you rich later in life...
Nothing in our world is limited, even gold inflates as new gold is mined every single day in Earth's goldmines. If that happened to run completely out at some point, I'm sure we can find enough gold in other places in the Universe that we can go after.
Ideally there should be a **TINY** amount of inflation in Bitcoin for hoarding to **not** be beneficial and be at most neutral. 
Inflation is simply natural as long as humans still have the capacity to reproduce and are not immortal. Deflation would only work out in the long term in a dying civilization.
That being said, I believe that Bitcoin can still succeed, it just needs minor tweaks to its economics.
@_date: 2013-03-11 17:31:19
Note that inflation isn't just for lending. It's for supporting new people entering the work force having access to equal pay as everyone else.
Even Gold inflates at a rate of 1.5% per year, people seem to think it's somehow limited, but it grows at about the same rate as the world population growth rate.
Nothing in this world or in nature is limited at a hard cap. Inflation is natural in a healthy economy(1), the only question is **HOW MUCH** of it. Certainly a lot less than what current governments are doing.
(1) see here as to why:
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:41:45
Even with the recent bubble pop and correction, there are guarantees that a deflationary currency will continue to increase in value, as long as it is used in an economy (other than for speculation).
Since the supply is limited, and such a subsidy would generate a lot of interest and people would compete over a limited quantity of coins, that alone would generate a price increase. It would probably even make sense to create an altcoin entirely for this purpose and it would potentially succeed.
