I'm sorry for your loss (and your family's loss). While I haven't gotten near to that point, I have faced bouts of depression over losing out on "being rich" from all the coins I had stolen in the past. And now that I'm unemployed and we need to buy a new car, getting rid of my final bitcoin to pay for it is proving to be pretty difficult. 
But in the end, I may not be monetarily rich, but I do have an awesome wife and some awesome little girls who make life incredible. It's unfortunate your brother won't have a chance at that, but hopefully your story can help prevent anyone else from losing perspective on what's most important in life.

Your guess is as good as anyone's. It could drop down more, it could shoot up more. 
The best bet long-term is to just place a buy order at a set period regardless of current price. You'll buy at the ATHs, but you'll also buy during every dip, so it works out.

As someone who also lost what would now be a good chunk of money due to theft, things will get better, and no amount of money would be more important than having your child grow up with a father. 
One thing I would suggest is look into whether or not you can itemize the theft/loss on your taxes. I'm not a CPA or a tax attorney specializing in cryptocurrency, but I do know that when my coins were stolen back in the last big spurt (when it topped 1000 for the first time!) being able to deduct from taxes helped lessen the sting.

If you think the price will go back down, there's nothing wrong with selling some to make a bit of profit. If it does go back down, you can use that profit to buy more. If it doesn't, you've still got coins.

The last time it hit an ATH and began to crash back down happened the same weekend as this, oddly enough. 
I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't hit 17k again until later next year, but I also wouldn't be surprised if it hits 17k again tonight. At this point who knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:05:43
That was my first goal when the price started going up the last week or so. I wanted to at least cash out my initial investment (which I made at the previous ATH-prior-to-crash) and anything after that is staying for the ride. 
That way, even if it does tank or go all the way down at least it's still a much bigger success than picking a bad fund where I'd lose it all.

I'm just having fun watching the buy/sell order walls fight. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:32:17
If it drops down to 10-12k I could see the people who bought into the hype the last few weeks panic selling and driving it down to ~5k or so. But I'm just making stuff up out of my ass.

Lots of people probably selling off before Sunday with the unknowns of the futures market coming.

Clap your hands if you believe, tophernator!

It probably sent bitcoins straight to Al-Qaeda!
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:00:39
A little over 2 BTC. Obviously it's no where near the amount others have lost, but since it was roughly 2/3 of all I've made mining the last few months it definitely stings to see all that time wasted.

How many of those are accurate, though? I live in Portland and tried contacting a few of the ones listed there for a story I'm working on, and they had no idea what I was talking about. A lot of smaller businesses/places seem to be stating they'll accept bitcoin as a PR move, and then a week later forget it exists. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:10:44
Exactly this. Hell, I remember having conversations with co-workers earlier this year. "Oh, Bitcoins are worth THAT much now? Wow, I hope everyone is selling while they can!" 
Oh, slightly-younger-me!

+this. 
I've sold digital things in the past on eBay using only their message system. A month later you get a reversal claiming their credit card/paypal was stolen.
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:05:51
I wouldn't be surprised if he holds a substantial amount of bitcoins himself. With paypal, it was never a matter of IF it would be replaced by something better, but WHEN. He likely has a ton invested into bitcoin, so he'd rather see something that isn't quite the same thing as paypal take off so he'll also make a bit, while he still won't lose being the only online payment method that is linked to a credit card.

Most people I know got it for Litecoin and the smaller scrypt coins.

Owns a rocket AND is making vehicles that run off of electricity. It's like he's trying to be a crazy Bond villain at this point.

I'd probably use it for a bit to mine up some of the alt sha currencies.

But if you get one BEFORE then and you win the "first person to lose a hand to an exploding phone" prize, you could possibly get them to settle out of court for btc!

Can you copy what she wrote?
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:27:08
Like quirk said, pretty much your only option. And you'll have to pay a bit above market price. That's also assuming people near you will be selling right now and not holding. 
If you're hoping to get in quickly while there's the crash going on, and you don't use localbitcoins, it's going to take until mid next week at the earliest.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:11:20
It's being hammed by so many people right now trying to buy and sell, it'll be working eventually. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:42:21
Yup. Same thing here. lots of people are having issues with the site right now.
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:40:22
I'm so sorry.

And like a gold rush, people selling the mining equipment are making out far better than (most) people buying it!
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:19:19
Nope! Very few currencies are mined with CPU only right now. The big ones are primecoin, quark, securecoin, yacoin. The others fall into either sha or scrypt currencies; you can find a list of them all online somewhere. You should be able to use a bitcoin asic to also mine any other sha-256 coins. Some are already pretty big (peercoin/namecoin), but there are plenty that are newer or still not worth a lot that you can try to grab up in hopes that they get more popular.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:01:50
If you've tried talking to them, have heard from them and still have no results, your best bet is to just contact some of the bitcoin bloggers/sites. Bloggers love writing about situations where companies/sites/whatever aren't giving money to people it belongs to. Drama = traffic = $$. And if they've ignored you up to now, once they start seeing any kind of press about it you can bet someone will get in touch.

With the attitude he gives off, I bet his mom tells him he's a great economist.
