Well, I have (had) a 30TH account with them so do not feel so bad over your reasonably $mall loss. Although annoying, their actions do confirm that after my eight months of testing them and a few others, virtually all cloud services are either SCAM's or money-holes that will never realize a ROI within an average person's lifetime. Best thing to do at this stage is simply spread the word and let others know these virtual ventures are simply not worth it.

You should be more informed before posting. It is the only respectable thing to do if you want to challenge anything I say. Sheesh...

GAW/Zen is a sinking ship and should be avoided like the plague. They make things up as they go and the best thing to combat their theft of consumer money is to report them to the SEC and FTC (

Wow... that is an educated reply. If we were face to face, I would buy you a beer and advise you relax while I attempt to teach you economics 101.

Attention ALL US Citizens Affected by GAW Miners, LLC, et al.
As of today, November 10th, 2014, GAW/Zen has reportedly sought the assistance of a Los Angeles based law firm to issue cease and desist communications to members of THIS and other public forums, not theirs, in what appears to be an attempt to censor those who have legitimate and factual claims against the alleged less-than ethical business processes and moral standing of GAW/Zen, its "CEO", and the various BDA’s they use. 
Irrespective of numerous peoples’ opinions published here and elsewhere on the Internet regarding GAW/Zen continually proving their fundamental M.O. is that of an elaborate SCAM in every sense of the word, this law firm has apparently taken it upon itself to either ignore the harm/losses dozens if not hundreds of previous GAW/Zen customers have been forced to endure or feel it is more appropriate to threaten legal action against those exercising their Constitutional rights rather than facilitating a thorough due-diligence investigation of their own client. 
Although I too have received a communication simply titled “Cease and Desist Letter” with a .pdf attachment from this law firm to one of my business email addresses, I refuse to open any such attachments or speculate on what the .pdf specifically says, if anything, as I do not know firsthand who the sender is or if the attachment contains anything potentially damaging to my system or network. Regardless, I would like to invite anyone else who is a US citizen and has also received any communication directly from GAW/Zen, any of their DBA’s, or this (or any other) law firm to contact my Mining Advocates Organization with their story at legal in preparation of the potential establishment of our own legal offensive to ensure this type of conduct by what can be seen as a questionable business, its "CEO", and/or a retained yet misguided law firm is not allowed to overtake the protections guaranteed to us by the United States Constitution and its amended Bill of Rights in addition to Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).
Thank you,
Scott Booth

Cryptocurrency is cryptocurrency. None is better than any other unless you look at its actual *use-value* and not its perceived (manufactured) value. I am not an "elitist" nor am I a Wal-Mart customer. However, I can recognize the fact that relative value is defined by each inner-dependent segment within a free market environment. In other words, the value of anything generated by the actions of the *masses* is the true foundation of any resulting outcome that enables elitism...and not the other way around. In the end, acceptance and popularity will always define the success of the payment medium - regardless of name, hype, or personal opinion. Doge has the numbers - like it or not.

To the "Haters"- Say what you will, but there is REAL money in Ð regardless of the visual eccentricities... Many of you will realize this at some point. If not, oh well... IMHO, Dogecoin is more about the spirit of ethically growing crypto-wealth and sharing it; not hoarding it (like 60%+ of all Bitcoins found to date) to create a false sense of longevity and value. True economists are now including Ð in their [positive] forecasts and note things are progressing MUCH faster when compared to Bitcoin and Litecoin at their same stages after release. Soon, it will be easier to buy a coffee for Ð500 from a national chain than figuring out and paying 0.00182260 Bitcoins for the same coffee. At any rate, to each their own. Now.. I will spread some wealth and put my Ð where my mouth is. Take care ;)

Mr. GAW does not have the customer base, resources or intellect to do anything regarding the value of BTC, which is global and magnitudes above his clone-coin enterprise...Period™

You need to account for alternative energy production (such as solar/wind/hydro) that offsets some of the power costs in at least 15% of the mining farms worldwide.

More double talk and side stepping trying to seek acceptance, forgiveness, or something else. Too little - too late. Anyone who believes anything you say should take a step back and simply review your past actions, which speak volumes. Now, please stop wasting peoples' time and bandwidth. Go back to your faithful followers on HashTalk and preach your wish for forgiveness to them. Your time here has expired™.

Well, I would bet if anyone does that, Mt. GAW will issue a baseless legal threat to them as Mr. HashTitan has been known to do in the past. You see, if Mr. HashTitan says something, it is the final truth. Question that or call him out in public, and you WILL hear from his single attorney. Trust me... I know first hand. ;-)
