If you didn't enable RBF when you created the transaction (vers .15 or higher i think), you can use child pays for parent as follows, it has worked for me in the past.  Consider this an intro guide, make sure you fully understand what you're doing before just accepting these steps as an algorithm:
1. Turn on "enable coin control features" and "spend unconfirmed change" in wallet options, 
2.  figure out the change address from your stuck transaction using blockchain.info with your transaction id (this is your money, it just isn't confirmed yet, the address on the right which the amount doesn't match your sending amount).  It has to be the stuck transaction's change address that you are going to send from so that you are creating a dependency for the next transaction you'll make.
3. create a receiving address (advanced users could consider creating a segwit address in console at this time but that's another guide.)
4. send a transaction to yourself from the change address (using the coin control features) to your new receiving address. This time use a fee high enough to raise the average of both transactions in satoshi's per byte to the level you want.  You need to pay more than the current acceptable fee because you are also adding to your previous transactions fee, effectively raising it.  If your change isn't enough to do this, you can add another input address to raise the amount, but this really hits the byte size of the transaction so hopefully not necessary.
Miner will see that processing your new transaction requires processing the previous transaction as well, and will confirm both so they can get the total amount which is profitable.
By the way, doing these steps sending from the other address on the right is how you would do a doublespend, which is why confirmations are so important before accepting that a transaction is complete.

Have you tried turning on "coin control features" and/or "spend unconfirmed change" under settings &gt; options &gt; wallet?  You may see your balance as it stands.  Plan for those transactions to confirm in the next couple of weeks.  Slushpool and the like are awesome for processing transactions as they get older.

My thinking is that unless OP is running one of the top ten pools (6 blocks per hour so 48 blocks in 8 hours, chances are you actually have to be one of the top 3 or 4 max to expect a block every 8 hours)  ) he or she can't promise to process transactions within 8 hours.  Unless OP just knows someone in those groups and is owed some kind of favour?
Happy to be corrected, always looking to learn something new :)  Sorry OP if you have info that can correct me I'd love to hear it.

You're saying that previous inputs to an address affect TXin size for an outgoing payment after confirmations?  Asking because I recently consolidated my balance to a segwit address, wondering if that was a waste.

I did a consolidation transaction (750bytes) like this to a segwit address on the day after Christmas for 40 sat/byte that confirmed on Jan 7th.  
How many sat/byte or BTC/kB are we talking when you say $150?  How long are you willing to wait?  
50kb transaction?  so about 270 addresses?  Total fee of .01 BTC ($150USD) to consolidate 270 x .001 = .270BTC = $3776 USD?  That's about a 2.7% fee.  However my quick math shows that's only a 20 sat/byte fee, so that's pretty low, better times that by ten to hope to get it through today, maybe times it by 5 to get it through in a week?  Not looking quite as reasonable.  Probably best to wait a few months and see what the landscape is like.  (I made a lot of assumptions there, I know, but I'm heading out to work so I won't be around for a while to see responses)
However, maybe your best option is consider using a paid accelerator service, they probably have a minumum fee level so make sure you're meeting that requirement when you send the consolidation transaction, and keep enough BTC back in your wallet out of this transaction to send the accelerator fee *with a strong mining fee for quick payment of the service from your wallet.  Just a quick check of a current 3Kb transaction from the mempool with about 20 inputs was going to take .0004 BTC, if that scales linearly (no idea if it does) you'd need almost .005, so still cheaper than doing it all without them.
I've had good luck with conifrmTX as a free service but I haven't used their paid service.  It's bit of a dice roll.  Maybe try consolidating 5 or 10 as a test?  Then 50-100 twice?
Good luck!  Nothing wrong with just HODL too remember.  who knows, each one of those .001 payments might be a month's rent or mortgage payment someday.

You've said the magic word "investing".  Giving advice on investment is a very regulated area in most countries, so maybe you could word it differently and get more response.  That said, 100 dollars is more of a "nominal" amount so I'd say buy 25 dollars worth of bitcoin every week over the next 4 weeks on an exchange like coinbase or whatever works for you in your country, and see how the fees work (you'd lose about 8 percent of your 100 doing this to fees but you may or may not gain that back by not buying it all at a 10% price hike).  Don't expect to cash it out, look into merchants that will accept bitcoin as payment and try using it.  Realize that taxes are a thing, if you make gains.  Some merchants won't let you send directly from an exchange so try sending some to bitcoin core on your computer or one of the reputable iOS wallets (not sure which, I don't use them), send some to your friends if you owe them a beer if that's your thing.  Think of the 100 dollars as already gone, it's your Bitcoin 101 tuition.
Good luck and good job asking questions.

Nodes compare the blockchain they are seeing with the known protocol and rules, and reject blocks that were mined that don't follow the rules.
Mining is trying to find a winning seed number from a nonce that resolves to a solution that begins with a number of zeroes that is determined by difficulty.  If they find one, they get to build a block of transactions from the mempool that provide them with the transaction fees and the block reward.
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:17:50
deposits and withdrawals are loose terms here, could mean exchanging dollars for bitcoin, or it could mean moving bitcoin from a wallet to an exchange.  I haven't watched the video, but currently yes, there are fees being collected by miners to process transactions.  There are however "second layer" options which allow no fee instant transfer, for example sending bitcoin between coinbase users.  These are called second layer because no transaction is actually taking place on the bitcoin network, it's more like an IOU spreadsheet being maintained by a third party.
Hope that helps.
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:59:16
If you want to know what Low/Economy/Normal/Priority fees are, [this page]( on mycelium's support seems to say that the estimate comes from  where low is the 20 block estimate, economy is the 10 block, normal is 3, and priority is next block.
The 20 block estimate is currently huge at 300 sat/byte so yeah, definitely wouldn't be using those settings myself either.
I wouldn't be surprised if your Ledger could import your Mycelium seed words, have you looked into that?
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:35:22
Transaction fee is based on how much data is required to explain your transaction.  If your wallet needs to take tiny balances from many addresses to total up the amount you're sending, that's going to cause a big transaction byte-wise.  The block can only hold 1MB or so of transactions (simplified) so if you're taking up more space in the block, you have to pay as much or more per byte as the other transactions being selected as your transaction's neighbors.
Sometimes miners have other priorities besides collecting the biggest fee possible.  These could be self serving reasons such as inserting accelerated transactions that they are collecting money on the side to process, or it could be benevolent reasons such as slushpool's awesome service of processing older transactions that are sitting in the mempool taking up space.  If you're into tin foil hats, it could also be that miners are not accepting transactions below their own personal threshold of where they think fees should be. (When I say miners here I mean whoever is in control of the pool overall.)
There's only one block every 10 minutes on average, and so it can be pretty difficult to predict how long it will take for a transaction to be processed.
But unless you were sending from some kind of dust wallet, a ~$15 transaction fee should usually be processed pretty quickly so this does seem a bit unusual to me.

Ahh ok I misunderstood what you meant when you said "received to the address many times"  thinking you meant if you had done that previously then were sending from the address it would cause a larger transaction, glad to see that you didn't mean that.
I don't think it's totally pointless to keep sending your change to a single address, it's still going to keep your fees lower in the future by minimizing inputs.  But of course, it's warned against everywhere for maintaining privacy.

I wish I could just type it out, but I am not quite at that level.
It's all about what a transaction actually is:  your coin is still in the address it was sent from until confirmation.  If you can send a new transaction that gets confirmed first, even to yourself, then the coins are spent and the nodes will reject the old one.  
There's some luck involved because you need to reach a node that has not got your old transaction in it's mempool.  That's the tricky part.  
I've never done it myself, you're probably better off trying child pays for parent.
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:13:50
I actually didn't realize you already had a balance on your Nano S.  In that case hopefully you can hold two different BTC wallets at one time on it, then you wouldn't require any transaction at all, both balances would be held there for when you want to spend them.
If it can't hold 2 wallets at once, you would have to send it like you originally planned from a different wallet that can import your mycellium balance.  I wouldn't try doing it how you described by switching the nano back and forth unless you were very sure you had your backups straight.

I don't think anonymity is a major draw of second layer, is it?  Developers of Lightning have always been pretty upfront that it requires more centralization than bitcoin alone.  I'm sure the selection of onion routing was for performance and security.
I'm pretty sure that you're wrong that you can determine if n+1 or n-1 is origin or destination anyway, because from what I understand there is a fake n+2 step at r-1 for exactly this reason. 
 I can see how a person might think they have determined if the transaction came from origin at n+1 if there is only one channel open at origin and it's to you though, sure that seems pretty self evident if you open a channel and send a transaction somewhere else other than who you opened that channel to, I would say that you should assume your going to be somewhat revealed to that node.  Nothing stopping the routing protocol from putting in a ping pong pattern to reach the number of steps required while the network is nascent though.  
That said I did note that you said "high confidence" which isn't the same as saying you know for sure.

That's a fair question which makes me think a little more about it.  I don't believe MITM can interfere in end to end HTTPS any easier than payment protocol, I'm not even sure there is really a difference in that sense.  If the MITM is successful on a secure session in browser I'm sure they can find their way into the Bitpay URI (I'm thinking of ad injection and service provider info examples, and of course the recent reporter tracking in Eastern Africa as evidence that malware can be injected)
At the very least I do believe that copy and paste risk is mitigated as well as a couple of common user errors, and I believe that bogus SSL certificates could be more easily detected since the wallet will not in theory connect to any domain other than the one provided in the payment link in order to retrieve the payment address.
Generally, Bitpay can do what they want within reason and they are within the protocol, and they did announce this change was coming, but the cacophony was at about an 8 at the time.  I just think it's good to see that some of the more obscure BIPs are being utilized and revisited.  I had no idea until Bitpay did this.  Guess I need to read every adopted BIP this weekend.

A bit of searching leads me to believe that the normal node's 300MB mempool cap has probably already been 'exceeded', since it looks like the local usage of 300MB is only about [110 MB of transaction data](  (See the top comment from Johoe) The node just evicts the lowest fee unconfirmed transactions, accelerating the returning of coin to user's wallets who didn't have a high enough fee.  Could be a good thing?

You can compile it yourself from the source code, which can be read line by line, or you can download the precompiled and compare the checksums.  It's a numbers game of course, at a certain point being too careful makes you a shut-in, chances are if you wait for a release from a reputable download site like github someone else will be the victim before you. :)  
I'm not saying the space is unworkable, just that there is a way to maximize security and minimize risk.  TBQH the average user is probably just as secure leaving his coins on an exchange where many staff's livelihood depends on the security of the system until they can afford a hardware wallet (same issues still exist) or has enough knowledge to create a paperwallet with an ubuntu stick.  Nobody is saying anywhere that there is no risk in Bitcoin :)

Wallets that are trustable are open source.  Every line of code is readable and compiled exactly as written as proven by a checksum hash.  The hope is that the code has been scrutinized like peer review over time to a degree that non coders can be assured that if there were a problem it would be revealed.  
If the wallet is not open source, there is really no way to know for sure.

If it's in cold storage during a fork and you send your regular btc out to an exchange later, you should still have the forked coin in the wallet with whatever balance you had at the time of the fork.  It might be a good idea to create a wallet backup file at the time of the fork in case the future iterations of wallet upgrades diverge too far to be able to be imported later.  Transactions after that point on the main chain are not being replicated on the fork.  I would not personally recommend importing your wallet or keys to an exchange after the fork as a method of being credited the alt (although from what I understand there are services that do this, it's giving keys to your BTC wallet to the exchange as well so generally it's best to empty your wallet to a new wallet elsewhere before doing anything like this, in that case it's ok). 
 Just know you're putting your trust in the exchange to credit you the forked coin.  Your better off using a separate OS or computer with the forked coin's opensource core lookalike wallet installed to restore a backup of your wallet or import your keys.  Once that's done you can send the alt coins to the exchange, which was definitely the whole point since there's no point claiming your forked coins unless you plan to sell them since they are hodling just fine in your original wallet anyways.
In fact, now that I think about it, I would not import a wallet with any real BTC in it to any forked coin software either.  At least not any newly created unvetted software anyways.  Empty the wallet then import no matter what I guess.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:49:53
You can use a payment accelerator service, or if you look into "child pays for parent" and "replace by fee": you may have the ability to get your transaction mined by increasing your fee after you sent the payment, depending on your wallet.
However, the mempool is currently decreasing and I suspect it will continue to do so.  You may even get confirmed before you know it :)

That’s what I would do as a miner, just have a field that set the bottom line, and if I stopped collecting enough fees at that level I would start to consider lowering it.  If the block reward is still enough to keep them going there’s not much reason to include lower fee transactions that set off a chain of algorithms to lower their suggested fees.

I would guess it's a market sell order of a significant amount as opposed to a limit order.  Someone sold to all the limit buy orders down to a certain level, but this leaves the next buyer still at the lowest available sell order, which puts the price at which the most recent transaction executes right back up at the average price.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:21:56
There's a few considerations.  Mining/Transaction fees are sometimes avoidable on coinbase, security of a wallet on a windows machine is doable but you're never really sure; not everyone wants to jump into a $100 trezor or ledger right away, and creating a paper wallet on a Ubuntu stick is beyond about 85% of bitcoin owners (pulled that number out of thin air).  Moving buy and sell orders on and off the exchange can add up quickly.
Don't get me wrong, I moved every 50 dollar coinbase purchase to my own wallet everytime, no regrets, but now that our investor friends see that the heat is down to a simmer they are going to start looking at 10% returns as a nice exit point again.  You can't sell what isn't on the exchange right?  
Same old problems.  Hope coinbase isn't fractional, but if it is, let's hope they are topping up soon.

They don’t have to spend anything to create a transaction while they are putting together the mined block that pays both the fee and change to themselves.  Just electricity, and they miss out on whatever the next highest real fee that was displaced  from the mempool.  ‘Tis a silly place.  Look for transactions in the blockchain with 1 input and 1 output, most likely spam, but they could just as easily fake making change so maybe that’s not reliable. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:17:56
Oh I don’t know about that, I don’t see any evidence of any specific pool or wallet or exchange having a disproportionate amount of influence in fees being processed.  I mean it’s possible that there’s simply no desire to get down into the 70 sat/byte stripe until some kind of critical mass is reached, but here’s hoping.  Miners can take or leave whatever transactions they want.  I just hope they confirm my 100 sat/byte child pays for parent sometime soon before it climbs again.
Parent is only 20 sat/byte though so I’m starting to lose faith :P

BIP 70 (payment protocol) is a core development.  Satoshi built in pay to IP (as well as wallet address) expecting that this would be the more common method in use.  He thought paying to a wallet address would only happen if the other party were not online at the time of the transaction.
Bitpay is trying to prevent man in the middle attacks which swap out the intended payment address for a nefarious theif's address (one of the main security problems IMHO).  They are simply forcing the payment address to travel through a secure SSL (edit: oops secure secure socket layer lol) connection.  But they expected net neutrality,  I think it's possible that Bitpay is exposing the sheer nakedness of our online commerce with this move.  It should work, but it doesn't.  What does that tell us?

After checking this gatehub site you spoke of, is it possible that by transferring out BTC you were actually creating a market order for 2.022 BTC worth of Ripple to be sold and lost a little to market buy orders, and then paying a .02 percent Ripple fee?  They seem pretty clear that their system is very custodial.

It was interesting to me that said paypal was the only option.  My original message really should have said "Why is bitcoin, credit card and cash, cheque or money order not an option?"  That would have been a better crafted question to get the answer I was looking for.  I wasn't insinuating that bitcoin would replace paypal today, just wondering what customer base have paypal as the only option.

Bitcoin's fraud protection seems sufficient to me, as long as we are protecting our private keys no one is going to be spending our coins.  Blackmail or extortion are obviously still vectors of attack but it's not like there is a database of customer private keys on servers like there are credit card details everywhere.

@_date: 2017-08-31 04:24:54
localbitcoins has some good deals in my country if you keep an eye out, and seems more reasonable on their transfer out fees than coinbase.  It can be a bit sketchy though when the seller needs your full photo id and such, but that's not always necessary.  Got a scam phone call shortly after a purchase one time, possibly unrelated.
@_date: 2017-08-31 04:48:26
Ok, a feature that I would like: if the payment interface provided a conversion to your local fiat as a kind of double check that the amount seems correct.  Whenever I make a payment, i use a google conversion to double check that I'm sending the correct amount.
Best of luck!

I suppose that makes sense since if you want to pay 11,000 per coin you have access to all the 10,000 coins as well, but I never really realized they did it that way, seems kind of counter intuitive.  I would have thought if it says 2 coins for 10,000 and 3 for 11,000 you can buy 5 coins at an average of 10,600, and the rising slope just means there are always more people willing to sell at the higher price at this level of participation.

To my understanding Coinbase seems to be providing Its own "lightning network" by not charging fees for transfers to other coinbase wallets.  With over ten million users that must be a fairly significant portion of the community.  I don't see a whole lot of difference between storing on an exchange and storing off chain with segwit.  Perhaps we will see the big wallets coordinating fee free transfers between their customers in order to grow their business and ease of adoptability.  Furthermore maybe there is space for a third party like interac or switch to provide a second layer with monthly settlements to merchants and wallets.  Or maybe bitcoin just doesn't need to be as convenient as cash.

It seems like you missed OP's point.  In his original post someone is selling yes, but no one is buying actual bitcoins.  The price of bitcoin overall wouldn't be affected by fractional reserve selling, (yet).
IMO it's pretty much a given that this happens on almost any front street cash to BTC business, otherwise internal transactions would be a part of the blockchain.  It's an easy way to short bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:00:40

[What Is A Full Node?:](
A full node is a program that fully validates transactions and blocks. Almost all full nodes also help the network by accepting transactions and blocks from other full nodes, validating those transactions and blocks, and then relaying them to further full nodes. /end quote
2x is a hard fork (I like to think of it as a copy paste of the blockchain that adds some extra code (from that point on) that provides someone somewhere some benefit, maybe the average user, maybe the miner, maybe the government who knows for sure, I don't because I'm a bit of a loyalist and haven't really looked at 2x whitepaper or whatever, but hey, free second coins, sure why not.  I have seen some pretty decent trasaction fees and confirmation times since Segwit activated.  Is 2x free from patents and black boxes? 
So there would again be two chains i.e. two coins.  Bitcoin core will only validate transactions on the BTC network (biased guess at which fork will retain the BTC symbol).  Using the Bitcoin Core wallet and running the node increases the strength of the network and decreases ability to double spend.  Miners are free to select whatever coin they want to mine.  If they all decide to mine 2x coins, I'll probably start running a 2SHA rig on my desktop.  the old coin will always have value as long as crypto currency is a thing.
Final thought: not really sure why setting a flag to no2x is even a thing in Bitcoin Core .15.  Running core is already a vote for no in my books.  All this does is expose your IP as the opposing side to the big boys of the NYA...  correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-09-08 04:23:45
 I see that coinbase is able to run a fractional reserve, not saying they are but it seems likely at least in a daily or weekly settlement way, it just makes sense not to pay extra transaction fees,
and I think I understand that Segwit is a separation of transaction header from transaction body allowing a second layer to pass signed transactions quickly without full coin history, right?   Is it the same private key, same wallet?
Can you help me understand 1, where segwit peer to peer confirmation is going to be happening and how a double spend can be avoided and 2, how much of the coin history is going to be recorded as the lightning transactions are settled on the block chain?
I realize I could just keep educating myself but dialogue helps, TIA.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:22:52
This makes sense, the 'physical' bitcoins are in a pool on the sell side.  Small sell orders would make for some pretty convoluted transactions in the ledger.

@_date: 2017-10-20 22:51:29
I'll probably get flak for this but I use coinbase to buy then empty it to safer storage whenever the balance builds up a little.  It's just so easy.  I tried using their underlying exchange GDAX but there is some problem  last time I tried in Canada to create an account.  Note you can't sell your coins on coinbase here in Canada yet.  Turning BTC into cash is where you'll find the most resistance.  I just spend them on goods and services then replace them, haven't ever sold them.
  I've also used localbitcoins to buy with no issues but sending your ID to randos can be a bit unnerving, and the price is usually a fair bit higher than coinbase here.  It's not for everyone.
Good luck!
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:41:17
Thanks for your reply.  
So basically effective hashing power of the real mempool is reduced creating scarcity and delays in user transactions being processed.
Seems like a waste of energy.  Why not just shut down half of your equipment (if the purpotrators control that much hashing power) to have the same effect, and turn them back on when the fees are high enough to be profitable again?  They want their actions obfuscated that much?
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:07:09
You bet!  I didn't think you were.  Hope I'm not coming across as an expert I'm just a guy with an opinion.
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:02:11
Canadian Banks don't seem to like exchanges.  Read up carefully, they have been known to freeze your bank account when the cash flows into your account.  Doesn't seem to be an issue with buying coins though.
I'd recommend going with localbitcoins, might be a bit of a part time job since you'll need to be available to respond to buy requests, but if you were to put up a more competetive price than the +20% I usually see there, I'm sure you'd have all kinds of action.
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:13:17
I would say, just look at what level of fee is generally being scooped into but not completely emptied, and go one level higher.
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:31:29


Don't the miners run the risk of competitors snatching the transactions from the mempool and taking their fees?  Or is there a way for them to write in their transactions and transmit to the network as the first time seen without even entering the mempool?  This seems like an avenue towards a solution if so.

I can see where you're going.  I don't think volunteering to raise only node transaction fees would make a difference, perhaps doing so with all on chain transactions would delay miners switching over, but miners choosing to hard fork are trying to 'roll a hard seven' so to speak in the first place so I doubt it would change too much.

Well, keep in mind that there are ways to use altcoins to move your bitcoin that doesn’t necessarily mean you will be “investing heavily” i.e. you are only splitting your balance into wallets off the btc blockchain then exchanging back in the manner you choose.  As long as the exchange has sufficient trade volume in the alt you aren’t really risking volitility for the short term that you hold the alt.  It’s certainly risky, yes, but would you lose the amount that you’d pay in fees on the blockchain?  These are the calculations someone doing this would need to do.

When a bankruptcy is imminent they don’t spread the word, that would be illegal as you would be causing harm to the shareholders.  In fact, even with healthy publicly held companies, I’m sure you’re aware that very very little information is released to the public prior to quarterly earnings reports.  Every employee in the world of a public company (as far as I’m aware) has a legal contract to not release information that would affect share price.  The same goes for privately held companies except that the motivation is not so much legal as it is self preservation.

Here's a few reasons I think this happens:
-Market buy orders vs. limit orders: somebody decides to invest/convert a fixed amount of money which gobbles up all the sell orders.  This would only happen on one exchange at a time, but arbitrage opportunities are probably botted up to the max which spreads the price around evenly on the other exchanges.
-Some piece of news moves the price creating buy opportunities (*cough *couch ~~JPM~~)
-The true value and acceptance of Bitcoin is not yet fully known in a widespread way, some new investor or group of investors have just received enlightenment.
-An exchange running a fractional reserve needs to cover their fraction and has no choice but to pay premium prices (see also sold short cover)
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:18:31
Well, I am sorry for misconstruing your post as a realistic expectation.  I thought you were saying that when you call a company that is going bankrupt, you expect them to tell you so as a customer.  That’s why I thought you were being naive.  It seems clearer now that what you are saying is that when calling customer service, you don’t expect to be lied to.  I’d agree that that is reasonable and proper.  But Mr Karpeles is saying above that customer service didn’t know that the company was in trouble when they were telling customers everything is fine.   I believe that, it seems very realistic to me.  So I don’t really think we are in much disagreement here.  
Sorry again for being condescending.  Fully admit I was.

It probably will get mined, if you ask me.  When something similar happened to me, I sent a transfer before my wallet had fully syncronized, so it had old data.  I contacted the vendor that I was sending to, and about 30 mins later the transaction was confirmed... maybe he had some other accelerator contact or some kind of miner contact, who knows.
