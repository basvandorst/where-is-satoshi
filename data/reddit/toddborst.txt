Thanks for the correction.  You are right. I misread the fee costs.  20 cents is easier to swallow.  Still will be a problem if bitcoin's value continue to rise.  Many of the items in the game do cost less than 1USD.

Why thank you. I haven't done much research into altcoins besides litcoin.  But I'll check it out.

As a merchant in Second Life, I beg a differ.  Linden Labs do have full control of Linden Dollars and charges a fee to convert into USD dollar for withdraw as well as imposes withdraw limits.  Not to mention they can create more of it at their leisure.
And finally, coverting to USD aside, I would rather get paid Bitcoins than Linden Dollars (which is only useful in Second Life).

Thank you. That was most informative.  Looks like I'll need to table the implementation until 0.9 is widely adopted.

This is a real bummer.  How the heck will we ever be able to spend satoshis if the fee value remains the same?

I've actually looked into that.  It appears that this service allows you to buy Linden Dollars (Second Life currency) with bitcoin.  It works indirectly just like how one can sell bitcoin for USD then spend it in regular stores.
The ideal scenario, for me anyways, is to be able to use bitcoin directly without changing it into any other intermediate currency.

Come on now.  If you're going with that argument, the USD is accepted pretty much world wide.  Why not use that?
