What does your age have to do with anything
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:06:13
Do you have any suggestions on how we can make this process more secure? I believe we do a very good job but obviously I'm missing something according to your expert analysis.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:17:02
Sure we can engrave whatever you send! The best place to get more info is at our website. You can upload your public key and any background photo you want!
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:48:54
No worries, and thanks again for the kind words!
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:28:06
That's why we prefer customers passphrase encrypt their private key so no one except the customer can access the coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:30:58
Oh, OK I've put the real link up. Thanks for the heads up!
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:19:10
It's anodized aluminum, not paint. It's scratch-proof, corrosion resistant, water-proof, and fire resistant up to ~1200°F (650°C) degrees, won't fade, deteriorate or flake off.

BIP 38 keys require both the key and passphrase, not just the passphrase... So covering up the key still serves a purpose UNLESS you decide to write the key down somewhere. Otherwise, you're not likely to memorize the private key, just the passphrase. When it comes time to withdraw the coin, scratch to reveal the private key and hopefully remember your passphrase... lol 
Hope this helps clear up the usability :) It's very viable

It's a scratch off sticker 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:55:43
Will do! The card in the pic is just an example 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:03:40
The magic of Adobe Illustrator and a high tech industry leading laser engraver! Thanks for the nice comment
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:15:47
Not sure I'm following 100% what you're asking, but if you're asking how do we secure the keys if WE generate them, the answer is that we go through an entire process to ensure the keys are never put online. Here's the snippet from our site: 


The only problem with this method is that the buyer has to put their trust in us that we will never use or share their keys (we don't, but still there's a level of trust there that needs to be established) 
This is why we encourage people to send us their keys with their private key passphrase encrypted with their own passphrase, so that we can guarantee no one will be able to access the coin except for them. 
Hopefully that answers the question?  :)  Thanks for the kind words!
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:56:05
Totally understand, however the encryption is still a much more secure way of doing this. Bottom line, we don't keep, store, maintain, photograph, memorize, or do anything else with the key, passphrase encrypted or not. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:54:14
Hm... still empty.... XD
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:33:54
Thanks for the advice, I'll do that! 
Heres a link to the store page: 
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:22:17
Definitely intentional! You found the hidden easter egg!
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:31:24
It's not irresponsible, we're not doing anything wrong or unethical. We take this very seriously. The only other person who could brute force it in this scenario would be... us. And we have no clue how to do that nor do we have any interest in doing so. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:57:05
Yeah technically this is true, there's no need to cover a passphrase encrypted key. But it's just an extra layer of security to prevent tampering. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:23:03
I'm generating the key because I'm creating the card
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:09:06
LOL I guess they're auto-hidden?
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:17:56
I'm printing them 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:47:06
lol, feel free to put something on it!
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:33:14
My engraver was $12,000 with the roller attachment and air assist
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:27:22
Are you asking how do you transfer money off of the card? You would use the private key with whatever wallet you wanted to transfer the money to.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:09:02
I completely understand the risks. Did you read my store page and read through the process I go through to engrave these? And I do outline the risks right smack dab on the store page. 
It's stated very clearly on my website that the risk is on the consumer and we make no intention of hiding that. 
We're offering an engraving service, and whether or not a customer takes us up on the offer is up to them. The risks are explained very clearly. 
I'm a bit insulted that you would assume so much about me and my service when you don't know anything about me, my knowledge of cryptocurrency, and the risks involved. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:40:05
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:53:45
I'd argue that this is more durable than any other cold storage solution out there, but yeah you have to definitely make sure the card doesn't get lost!
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:54:45
*blush* Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:44:24
Thanks for the extra info! Yep, these cards are rock solid
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:02:12
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:54:00
I do! You can checkout and pay with BTC using BitPay
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:21:24
I'd be happy to apply that scent for you. It should be pretty easy to do!  XD
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:00:43
Go for it!
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:35:56
Here's our website! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:31:23
Sure! 
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:44:15
**Edit: Not sure why the mods closed the giveaway... did I do something wrong?** 
**Edit 2: OK Thanks all for entering (while you could.. again, not exactly sure why the post was locked by mods. I guess they weren't in the Christmas spirit!)**
The winners are: 
I will send messages to you folks later, or you can message me!
I do sell these if anyone else is interested. The link for the cards is: 
Thanks again folks and I hope you all had a Merry Christmas!
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:24:28
With a scratch off sticker :D  You can buy them online
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:11:03
I'm very conscious of the security of this process. That doesn't mean I'm automatically capable of cracking passwords. Your logic is flawed.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:08:19
The card is engraved using a laser engraver, it's not printed, it's etched :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:44:35
I'm the company etching it. We don't typically create and send off our own generated keys. Customers send us passphrase encrypted keys so that no one except for the passphrase holder can access the coin. But on top of that we go through a shit ton of extra security measures to ensure these are as safe as possible. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:32:40
Here's a link to the store page if you want to check them out: 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:51:17
Of course, it's simply an added security measure. The same could be said about a paper wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:29:30
Yep, here you go! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:01:29
The only kind of diarrhea I appreciate
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:31:00
I'd be happy to sell you the blanks if you'd like. Do you want the cards printed with the background design? Or just a blank black card?
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:37:20
That is correct, this is just the public key. 
We do offer the card with a private key however we require the key be passphrase encrypted. Even then, we still want to make sure customers understand the risk involved in doing this. Here's the link for more info.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:17:59
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:13:40
Yes if you have your own design you want to upload, I provide this service on some of my other listings. 
This listing would be the best to upload to: 
You can upload your design using the upload feature right above "add to cart"
Make sure to upload a high quality image! The better the quality, the better the results.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:31:02
Yep that is the risk with any type of cold storage. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:52:41
I'd love to do that however my engraver does not etch into metal, it's only capable of etching a coating of material off of metal, to expose the metal underneath (just like the card pictured). I'd love to be able to engrave with a deep etch but... that's gonna be awhile until we can invest another 30 or 40 grand into a capable high quality machine! Sweet idea!
