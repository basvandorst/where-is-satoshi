This post is borderline, or @_date: 2014-09-05 05:52:01
I'm trying to, but with the difficulty increases it just looks gloomy. If you have a miner or mining strategy that's profitable i'd love to hear it :)

Public perception of bitcoin is changing, soon people will acknowledge it's beauty and simplicity, along with safeguards against inflation, bitcoin is a superior currency is it not?

Alright, i have proof it will for you :)

Well said. I'm just a humble newbie trying to get into mining with an AntMiner S3+ or RockMiner R3, i'm wondering if it's worth it anymore.

Mining with the BitMinter Mining Pool 24/7 makes $0.46 usd or 0.001 btc a month PER 1 Gigahash/s, this miner is 453 Gigahash a second, i plan to overclock to 500 Gigahash/s, so it will make 230 usd or 0.4804 btc a month according to my math. Meaning it makes 1.201 btc per 2.5 months i believe.

bluelightzero, i'm just being extra cautious because i want to. Not because i really doubt them.

You're probably right honestly, i'm going to look into altcoin mining and trading for profitability.

Ah, that's one thing i haven't considered, i don't understand how the difficulty increases work, would anyone link me a page or such about it?
@_date: 2014-09-04 13:12:04
Thank you, The Reddit Community seems very nice, i think i'm gonna stay here for a while :)

I'm thinking the value of bitcoin is going to go down soon, ASICs will always have value as they generate bitcoin, the Silk Road Auction is dumping more supply onto the market and demand is staying steady, and what happens then? Value decrease.

Also, if anyone could recommend a good miner for $500-600 usd that would be amazing. I'll have 1.2 btc or so.
