but you will have .000000008 bitcoin and .000000008 B2X - so that much of each coin. (i didn't do the math to get to .000000008, just an example)

I saw that! Looks like BTC will hopefully take it all back now over the next few hours. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:32:34
that is not a lot of bitcoin at all..... heavy fee for just $10 worth.

bought back in at 5760 - so far your advice looks good :)

I see this too! and sometimes i feel like they do it $5 apart. 250 coins at 6000 and 250 at 5995 - they trade themselves and stall it out.... Have you seen that too?

Seems like there is a slated upgrade to adjust the difficulty of BCH tomorrow? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:11:45
i just got woke up over this by a great friend.... What is going on?!?!?! is Bcash taking over? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:05:18
2.33X more profitable to mine BTC now! :) 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:51:58
I am wondering the same.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:46:51
i looked on the BCH website and it seems they are planning a hard fork tomorrow. I'm not sure how this affects things. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:05:01
Difficulty just increased! Its now 2.33 more times profitable to mine BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:44:02
unfortunately.

What is this?   
looks like miners came through and cleaned up the backlog of Bitcoin Cash. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:56:17
No clue lol
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:19:13
I just can't - pulled back into ETH - I'll set buy's for just slightly higher than 6050. I just can't loose it all! so many unconfirmed transactions that this is crazy. Looks like very bad. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:27:26
I sold, doubt its going to just shoot right up to $8,000 so I'll pick it back up on the way up.
