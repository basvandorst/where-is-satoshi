Please excuse my ignorance of this topic but I'd really like to know a couple of things and you sound like the man to help me.
I know I can use my PC to work on math problems for a week for a small piece of a bitcoiin but really don't understand anything about them other than that.
Please could you tell me:- 
1 - why I would bother to do this (due to the tiny rewards relative to time spent on it) 
2- if I see something for sale online for $1000 why would I pay with bitcoin and not my plastic. 
Sorry of these sound dumb as shit but I really struggle to understand why I might buy a coin for $1000 and get up in the morning and find it's only worth $600, why would I take that risk as I can already use my plastic on the net (debit or credit) as well as google pay/paypal etc. 
Is it purely a speculative thing where I hope for an increase in value (if this is the case then I've clearly missed the boat!!)
Thanks in advance for helping an older redditor who is always one step behind.

Man this is so helpful, thanks for taking the time, it really did help. I particularly like the idea of a truly global currency, my wife and I have moved around the world for about 8 years now and every time we do we have banking issues (we've both said many times that there should be a global currency) I hope more and more places start accepting bitcoins as payment...man that would be useful to us.
Thanks again Brains, I may just pay you a visit in the future and grab me some coins.

WTF is this supposed to mean exactly, besides advertising for some lambo place in Newport Beach?
