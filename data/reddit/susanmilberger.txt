Very interesting.  Can you share some quick info on what kind of equipment you would use, and how the math adds up, buying electricity vs buying gas and generating electricity?

Right, but fiat could easily work just like it has for the last hundred years, for another hundred years.  Nobody knows.  All in is just plain crazy, but I admire your spirit!

5,000 x 1 dollar is a fuckload less than 20 x 5 thousand dollars.  Not impossible, but not exactly probable either.

I agree, but there is still an element of panic selling affecting the price, its pretty undeniable.  
Will be interesting to see how big of a dent the pornography is embedded/btc is illegal everywhere fud makes in the price.  Should be telling. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 11:38:05
The price is fragile atm.  Bitcoin itself is resilient af

You make a convincing argument, no doubt.  I looked at the table again and still don't hate it though, everyone processes information differently I guess.
