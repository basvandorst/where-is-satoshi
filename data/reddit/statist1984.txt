Intronsine, basically he mined for 5 days and at the 6th he rested... 
yes he mined longer to have a higher difficulty genesis block, to prevent other people to create a  paralel ~~universe~~ bitcoin with more blocks...

i think all this sidechains is nonsense, what is the reward for mining the sidechain? fees? look it will be uneconomical then. I think we already have a sidechain for data it's called namecoin and it was the first alt-chain.
What you are talking about is called *scrow* and it's possible with multisignature.

there are other services for this, they cannot spend resources on this i guess.
Anyone can sign up for free but they have to review the site, etc etc.

yes, but he can possibly had travelled and had an account in a Eurozone country.

Is there any chinese exchange accepting CNY direct deposits or transfers from within china? or do they still run the voucher scheme?
@_date: 2015-03-16 17:17:55

an invoice from btcguild? it would have been more believable  if it was from blockchain.info, the hackers a graceful today ...
@_date: 2015-03-14 00:37:35
they have something called accounting, just like a private ledger that they can manipulate at will but it has to follow the accounting rules. when sending to other countries they have to go to swift. they follow some rules, but yes, they can create money out of thin air with loans or if they are stolen money they can cover it, but only in their native currency.

i wonder what they would say if the pension fund were to put the money onto bitcoin instead. safes have a maintenance cost.
@_date: 2015-03-14 21:02:39
socialists? for that they will need dogecoin. nothing to see here, moving on.
@_date: 2015-03-16 20:23:15
you can use namecoin-qt too i wonder why there's no apps for this, oh wait it's right there on the wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-05 23:45:39
Can we add this to bitcoin obituries?
@_date: 2015-03-15 18:46:37
it's really a bad time to buy USD now as is very expensive now, you should try localbitcoins and mycelium trader to buy bitcoin in person in your own currency.
@_date: 2015-03-16 20:21:38
yes if it's the same version. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 23:46:54
Fun fact, it will be worse than the bastard kid between ppcoin and dogecoin. It will be a 100% premined, distributed to banks and have 2% proof of stake inflation, banks private keys will be whitelisted for processing transactions and everyone with over 1$ will receive interest. That will encourage people to move to digital currency where they can track all their movements, since all exchanges will only accept transfers from kyc compliant bank accounts. It will trade 1-1 only on selected US banks, in other parts of the world will trade at a premium or a discount depending on the demand. 
It will be popular for move money fast around the world and as an onramp on btc exchanges. As there is no way for users or market makers to make money from this the ecosystem will never fully develop and it will die a slow death.

well, seems like everyone is going insane nowadays, heck, even it wouldn't surprise me if it turns out that Satoshi is that Craig guy that has gone insane after losing the private keys to his coins.
