You still do not understand what a digital settlement layer is. MySQL stored information can never be a digital settlement layer, the settlement need to be either on the physical level like cash, gold, or at an authority level like government central bank, and that can never work globally. Because every system has their own infrastructure which is an isolated system. Bitcoin solves this problem and **Bitcoin is the first digital settlement layer.** Regardless of nation, or location. Only internet connection is needed. Once you got the transaction IT IS SETTLED, you don't owe anyone anything, and you don't need to cash in or out in physical form to complete the settlement.

Most people are just like you, they don't really understand what is going on. Funny that you think I am a scammer by reading my post, it is incredible how lucky I am being born with this intelligence, it is a true privilege. Thank you for reminding me that I have so much to be grateful for ;)

It is normal for good form of money to be hoarded, and bad form of money to be spent. Throughout history coins that were 100% gold or silver were saved, and less pure coins were used in the market and those were in circulation. Bad money drives out good money from the market.

It baffles me how someone like you could be pro Bitcoin with so little understanding and while being so close minded and only out for picking up fights and up to no good.

Because I don't normally post on reddit, and for that reason this became my main account and I will use this account to post here from now on.

I must admit I am quite surprised. People like you are almost unbelievable. I should post more often on reddit to be reminded of the fact that there are a lot of people like you out there. Kind of like flat earthers. It is easy for me to live in my own bubble and assume that most people have enough intelligence to think with common sense. Thank you for the wake up call ;)

Search for "lagarde central bank digital currency" on Google. Digital currency, or digital money, has not existed before Bitcoin. You clearly do not understand the difference between digital currency/money, and information about money being stored digitally. Most people do not understand the difference between those two, and so most people do not see the point in Bitcoin because they usually say: "Why do we need Bitcoin when we have Venmo, and Visa, And PayPal, and I can send money over internet so whats the point with Bitcoin." You can Google it the terms as I said and realize that there is no digital euro, but that the European Central Bank (ECB) is considering making a digital form of money (EURO) to keep up with the demand of the digital world, so no, there is no digital euro. Again I repeat. Just because information about EURO and USD is stored digitally, does not make it digital money, it is still fiat. And this is my last response to you, because if you still do not understand, there is no way I can explain it to you. I don't have time. Do your own research.

Read my post again, because you don't understand ;) This is what most people think, (that we have had digital money for years because of internet and websites). Money is not digital just because information about it is being stored digitally. It is still fiat money. Big difference. Most people do not understand this, my post was a way to try to explain this. You need some technical background and preferable programming background to understand how digital bank systems work (bank websites and how they store information), it does not work like cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Most people do not understand this, most people think money is already digital so they see no point with Bitcoin, which is basically lack of understanding.  **Bitcoin is the first digital settlement layer.**

I don't understand how you can come with a comment like this, if you have read my example. I genuinely regret using so much of my time, trying to explain things to people that have no means of understanding what I am trying to explain. The joke is on me at the end. You are just doing your best, it is not your fault. Bye
