Volatility can't be bad in bitcoins case, whats bad is being stuck at a downward spiral like todays momentary system aka fiats.

Guess, when no one is in charge and can reverse transactions and/or find the buggers, no one can help us but Toshiba in that case.

You kill the guy who takes the money?
@_date: 2014-02-02 00:18:47
Yes! Or he can save enough regular coins for a big pool.

I was very tempted to order, but could not find the shop in 30 seconds so i exited your site.
@_date: 2014-02-13 08:54:37
maybe outlawed and regulated perhaps, but there is plenty of things currently that is flourishing massively even due to that and they are not even digital numbers, but rather smelly substances with complicated delivery methods. my point: outlawing this will just take this one more step to complete system failure from within the matrix.

So it's easier to convince him to buy a "lottery ticket" (mining rig) than some real investment in technology?
@_date: 2014-02-13 08:31:22
Or what if a "bad" country threats the world with nukes if they are not payed x million in anonymous coin they simply nuke some huge city or something. Even worse scenario. Now let your nightmares free.
@_date: 2014-02-02 00:07:34
Yes! And now finally he can store his wealth in bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-02-07 11:39:52
Nice! But one beer on 8 guys? Guess its not the drug of choice xD

Pure Genius
@_date: 2014-02-13 11:02:52
So we need bitcoin foundation or someone else to pay a team that constantly test everything the like a secret shopper that gives ratings and writes banlists? Jesus

"On the seller side, it’s business as usual. Revenue is earned and withdrawn in US dollars. The option to withdraw revenue in Bitcoin is currently not available on Fiverr."
@_date: 2014-02-02 00:16:57
No No No! Im happy to take your tip, but you had a point in the line so the bot wont verify it. I don't have any dogecoins yet.
@_date: 2014-02-13 08:47:36
Why not tell him to buy coins simply? Most people buying mining rigs will never pay off the cost from them.

Good metaphors. Another one would be:
Yes it's a conducted act and it's beautifully played music with hundred thousands of voices and different instruments. And soon the conductor will go from low tune instrumental music, and start up the choir again.

Sadly, the guys who hypothetically threaten with nukes or kidnaps would not risk getting caught with cashing out I believe. I'm not a tech savvy but how exactly do you mean they get caught, isn't there a fool proof way of making bitcoins into physical money or valuables without traces? 
@_date: 2014-02-13 08:05:30
this is the only true way to convert the grey masses!
@_date: 2014-02-13 08:43:43
Also BTC price would rise -.-
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:46:05
because: win-win
@_date: 2014-02-02 02:24:47
I just wanna create a debate
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:34:46
Yes, the likeness of bitcoin going to the moon is not so bad.
We have not yet left the atmosphere... not even past the Satellites [:
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:30:23
Me! But just one btc
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:08:49
people like that buy and sell bitcoins for each other if they are smart.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:36:35
or atleast head of defence
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:12:30
Are you one of these people who thinks its a xbox game or what?
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:38:13
you mean a global EMP attack or how else can you get the power out at the whole planet at the same time??
I suppose what happens to bitcoins is just waiting time, if nobody mines there be no new blocks, and all stays as it is.. When power is back, the new blocks generates and everything back to as it was.. But I guess an attacker could maybe create false blocks from the moon or some very deep and emp safe isolated bunker getting all the coins to one of his wallets!! Then we talk about a major hacker!
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:09:56
Thats true, but getting what if you can get your houselord to accept bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:22:41
No you are just drunk sometimes! Good choice bitcoin is like paypal but faster ;)
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:02:30
if oil be valued from the same theory it would be pretty pretty cheap

The economic communities are screwed up:

Very cool graphics and information seems to be right.

@_date: 2013-12-10 21:20:28
The reason why I came up with the question is I'm watching the Noble Prize Ceremony, and it was the economy part they talked about the economic world being split in two halves with irrational and rational thinking of the world economics science. So I thought bitcoin is just like that, people being irrational buying bitcoins and selling it or buying stuff for it directly and missing out the long term investment. Irrational behavior.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:15:51
YES EVERYBODY TAKE ON BITCOIN OUT AND BUY IT BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!! CRASH IT AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:33:27
