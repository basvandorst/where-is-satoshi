I own a business selling product on Amazon.com. A recent purchase of ~$4.4k in inventory cost me ~$150 in Paypal fees. That's 3.4%. With Bitcoin I think that could be 1-1.3% or less, I need to find a better exchange in the US to buy BTC for a lower exchange rate fee. Anyone know of a good alternative in the US to Coinbase at an exchange rate fee of 1%?
I can't wait for the day distributors accept this payment method. On these products in particular I compete against Amazon themselves on price. If I can get this distributor to eventually accept BTC, and they were open to the idea (at the time were hesitant due to Mt. Gox media attention), then Amazon will be no longer unable to compete with me unless they find a better way to transact money.

I just wrote a C# client for this API.
It was easy seeing as there are only two endpoints.
I'll be keeping this client up to date if there are any changes with the API.
Instead of asking people to let you know their user agent you should set up an auth token that you can get for free by filling in an email address and subsequently emailing them the auth token. This would be much easier to maintain, in a database table with:
EmailAddress, AuthToken
example 12jklsj2k3l
I assume you want to monitor requests or rate limit. This too would be easier with an auth token.

I just paid using BTC on playerauctions about two weeks ago, the process was super smooth.

I wrote this C# MtGox Client that utilizes the HTTP V2 API.  No credentials are stored.  However, not all routes are implemented.
If anyone wants to contribute, I'll merge pull requests after review.
