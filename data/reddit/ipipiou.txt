Log scale make sense on high volatility chart. You want the difference between 100 and 200 dollar to be comparable to the difference between 1000 and 2000 dollar.
Situation 1 : invest 100 dollar when btc is worth 100 dollar. When btc is worth 200 dollar you "won 100 dollar" (if you sell of course).
Situation 2 : invest 100 dollar when btc is worth 1000 dollar, when btc is 2000 dollar you "won 100 dollar" (if you sell of course).
Both situation are the same, so you want your graph to show you that.
A 100 dollar move in 2013 is crazy, now it's irrelevant, a log scale will show you that.

Not this kind, the kind of crypto rich when it's hard to sleep at night because you don't know if your coins are safe.

Some people want it, not everyone is ready to be totally in charge. If I was ultra rich, I would search for a way to store some in a trusted tiers, digital security is a job and not everyone is good at it.
