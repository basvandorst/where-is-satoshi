And how does the community police itself better?  
@_date: 2014-06-01 14:25:43
That's because people didn't have the blockchain.  Now that they have a blockchain, it's better for them and they can control their own future!  Company stores were only evil because people couldn't get out of debt, but if they had a block chain, they could get their own coins and start their own company.

Also forgot to add - credit cards give me extended warranties for free, insurance on my rental cars, discounts on gifts cards through points, etc.
As for concerns, two of my cards were compromised in the target data breach.  In both cases, the replacement cards were over-nighted to me and I lost no money to fraudulent charges.  Please tell me again what concerns I'm supposed to have with my credit cards?

Buy a gift card from Gyft and sell it to a pawn shop for 80% value.
@_date: 2014-05-14 12:28:04
Let's say they hit 45%, and then redirect 5% off to another pool.  Now they show 40% but have 5% hidden.  Again, they creep up to 45% and again, they move it to a different pool.  Now they really have 50% of the power, all they need is 1% more.  So now when they hit 42%, they switch back that 10% and bam.
Of course, no one on the internet would ever do anything greedy or dishonest.  Especially with bitcoins are involved.
@_date: 2014-05-15 14:18:18
But, again, how do they police it?  What authority will they have to do anything?
@_date: 2014-05-14 14:49:04
Never said it doesn't happen to anyone.  Never said it doesn't happen to innocent people.  In fact I went back to clarify that.
I doubt that the average large transaction 10-50k would set off homeland security without another red flag (large cash deposits with no matching tax, or people not on the account making cash deposits for example).  Even less so if it is a singular occurrence, and even more less so if there was an asset gain (home purchase) recorded nearby.

That's a huge hurdle though - people want a service that handles things for them.  They don't want to worry about conversion rates or properly securing data.  
They want to know they walk into a convenience store and can buy a sandwich and soda.  They don't want to walk in to find out there was a 40% price drop and now they don't have enough money in the wallet because of conversions.  They don't want to keep multiple copies of wallets or even learn how to properly secure a password.  
People, in the end, really want banks.

USD, bitcoins, turquoise beads, or pinecoins - the debt won't go away.   You will still be enslaved to the things you want.  Just you will pay for them in a different way.

So what happens when you're holding facebook coins, and the CEO knows something bad is about to happen.  He, and the entire board of directors decides to get out and flood the market with cheap facebook coins.  Now you're left holding facebook coins that now have a significant lower value than they had before.  More importantly, what can you do to prevent that from happening?

Even better - I got free coins from somewhere (Coinbase, I think) and that's what has funded my CEX GHS.  Each day, I convert the NMC into GHS and each week I convert the BTC in GHS.  Add in a bit of multi-pool mining and I'm doing alright.   Even better is GHS goes up.  
If BTC got super cheap, I'd put some money in it but not at ~500 USD.

So votes can happen at any time?   What prevents people from simply just trolling the system by constantly electing and de-electing someone grinding everything to a halt?

No one's saying to ignore, but very simply past performance is no guarantee of future results.  Obviously, if a company has a history of underperforming there is a greater risk of failure but there's always the risk regardless.  For the longest time, RIM/BB was the leader in cell phones for businesses. 
The past should be used as one factor when considering where to invest, but it is no indication of what the future brings.

Yes, I can google it and find people who were "innocent" victims.  Everyone's always innocent.  It tends to take a bit more than just one large withdraw to have the gubberment beating down your door.

Exactly - there is no benefit to bitcoin here.  Nothing bitcoin does has changed the transaction except added a risk of volatility.

Short answer, no.  Long answer, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

TPB supports decentralized sharing of files.  When it begins to pave my roads, provide police (and other assistance) and provides a system of laws let me know.

Words just fail me - this is truly a case of cutting off your nose to spite for your face, or ... well, I guess removing the tooth to spite the dentist.  
I promise you what happened after you left is the dentist said, "This guy couldn't afford the replacement, but wanted me to take some other weird currency."  You didn't help "the cause".  All you did was seem like a shyster trying to screw him.

He uses this bank as a explanation of why he likes bitcoins.  If it's not his bank and he's not suffered with these hours, why would it have any bearing on how he feels about bitcoin?   Nothing about the RBS or its hours affect my daily life or my decision to invest in bitcoin,

Woah, watch it with your fancy fiat economics.  This is bitcoin - you can do anything.

Underachievers.  I actually talk to the delivery drivers.  Nothing says, "I've got your attention" like blocking their truck with your car and telling them about the teachings of Bitcoin.  
I even had a driver say, "I'll consider reading about bitcoin if you just let me make my next delivery."  EPIC WIN!

Please explain to me the difficulty of shopping at other places on the web.  I wish to hear the burden that Amazon makes you suffer.

Maybe they'll use the $275k to invest in Just-Dice - turn that $275k into a cool $0!

I own shares of companies, having digital voting rights, and in theory I could run for a board seat if I really wanted to try.

Try living in a rural development with 30 homeowners.  Much different experience when you're a single entity with a neat limitless supply of resources.

I may be part of the lucky few, but in 18 years of banking I've never had an issue that couldn't be resolved with a quick phone call but yes, the hours suck for most people who have to deal with problems.  There are some banks that are starting to have later hours and are even open 7-days.  Is it the norm?  No, but if you really need that feature it might be best to switch to that bank.
