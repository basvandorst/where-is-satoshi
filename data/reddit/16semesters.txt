There are people still without debit/credit cards. 100% of people will not be involved in Bitcoin in 7 years.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:25:46
Your first graph is just straight up conjecture. 
You're out of your mind if you think 100% of people will be using bitcoin by 2025.

Showed them the graph of its price in July of $2,000 ("Ridiculously expensive! It will crash!"). End of the smirking.
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:55:39


But OPs graph claims **100%** of people will use it by 2025 and there's plenty of people that will never use Bitcoin that will live another 10 years. 
That's what I'm refuting. It's a terrible graph with no sources and you're defending it by saying "well eventually" but the graph has a finite date for 100% usage; 2025.

So the 72 year old retiree that's not gonna kick the bucket for another 15 years and still balances their check book by hand is going to jump right into crypto in the next 7 years?
Come on, that's not reasonable.

OP this ad is showing that because they lost money on bitcoin they need a new job.
Not sure if that's your intention or not, but it's making fun of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:56:33


Yes really.
If the bitcoin was not actually purchased by fiat backed tether and instead purchased by "created out of thin air tether" then it's nothing more than blatant market manipulation.
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:39:39
If the tethers were not truly backed by fiat like many people believe, then the creators of the tethers created a worthless token out of thin air to artificially inflate the price of bitcoin.

Naw, more likely she brought the check to work, and cashed it at a place nearby maybe on a break or maybe before her shift. 
Tons of check cashing places around dollar stores.

Wait. 
You're calling out Allied Wallet for allowing users to deposit money to pokerstars?
... Isn't that massively hypocritical on a bitcoin sub?
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:40:53


That's not what they are saying.
Exchange of currency is good for economies on literally every scale. 
Holding onto money means that companies can't grow, loans won't be made and everything stagnates. Businesses close, people lose their jobs and economies suffer until the currency starts flowing again. 
This happens with literally every financial crisis.

Completely different.
Pets.com and the ilk never had sales. It was people putting money into a belief instead of a functional business. Pets.com literally just had .com after their name so people thought it was valuable. Very similar to the cryptocurrency bubble.
Amazon, while famously not being *profitable* because of their huge R&amp;D and expansion budgets has always had good revenue. They grossed 1.6 *billion* dollars in 1999. In that same year, Pets.com grossed 600k!
Companies that had legit revenue streams weathered the dot com era fine. It was really basic fundamentals.

Winning streaks when discussing stocks and other assets simply means that over multiple days in a row it closes higher than it opens. It does not infer anything about the underlying health of an asset. I can understand in assets like bitcoin where there is no market open and close that this poster may not be aware of the lexicon, but that's the standard definition.

SpaceX is a completely separate company from Tesla. SpaceX is private while Tesla is public. Investors in Tesla do not get any equity in SpaceX.

I have 0 skin in the game. All my investments are in traditional vehicles. I've researched bitcoin and don't believe it has a "bullish" (the original statement) projection. 
It's hilarious you call me a gambler, when you're speculating on a wildly volatile asset.

You mean OFAC? Well it was founded in 1950 but its predecessors have done the same function since the War of 1812.
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:48:50
Which makes it even sillier for OP to deride them saying "they were busted for money laundering" because they were simply payment processing for an online gambling site.
You know, like people do with bitcoin every single day.

You think that anyone that disagrees with you on bitcoin's pricing future is uninformed, or has not done their research? Because that's what this guy is saying. It's the classic "you're dumb if you disagree with me" garbage.

Have you really not been paying attention? Newspapers will print literally any shady ad that pays them. Tons of financial papers have ads selling peoples investment "strategy" books or other schemes. This has been happening since before you were born.

You just said it again.
Anyone that disagrees with you doesn't understand the system. Who exactly made you the arbiter of economics?
