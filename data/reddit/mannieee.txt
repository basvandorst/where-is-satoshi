"Where you use bitcoin to purchase goods or services for personal use or consumption, any capital gain or loss from disposal of the bitcoin will be disregarded (as a personal use asset) provided the cost of the bitcoin is $10,000 or less."
Does that mean if your purchase cost of BTC in a tax year is less than $10k, CGT doesn't apply?

I've seen some start ups but not anything like COMEX for bitcoin. What exchange are you talking about? I don't want to get into a big thing about gold futures but there is a lot of conjecture about the flood of paper gold contracts on COMEX and the ability to honour delivery. There is a lot of physical gold heading east, for sure, but a lot of the contracts are for eligible, not registered, holdings, as far as I'm aware.

From the article:
In particular, from a capital gains tax (CGT) perspective, it could have been argued that bitcoins should be treated as proprietary property and thus a CGT assets (for those holding them on capital account). This may have resulted in a CGT reflex on the disposal of bitcoins. Based on the comments above, this view is now potentially in doubt. Interestingly, what this view may signal is that the ATO is leaning towards a more 'radical' tax treatment of bitcoin - for example that it could be more akin to 'money'. Which would obviously be an outcome many in the bitcoin community would welcome.

maybe its the last chance to buy up big before the hedge funds dip in and take this up

Found this in the draft TD 2014/D12. Still a lot of WTF.
"18. This Draft Tax Determination is not intended to define the circumstances in which Bitcoin would be a personal use asset. Bitcoin is not kept or used for personal enjoyment. Bitcoin that is kept or used mainly for the purpose of profit-making or investment, or to facilitate purchases or sales in the course of carrying on business is not used or kept mainly for personal use. Bitcoin that is kept or used mainly to make purchases of items for personal use or consumption ordinarily will be kept or used mainly for personal use. Other categories of use conceivably could exist; taxpayers in these cases should seek private rulings."

The beauty is, even if he is wrong a year, two years down the track, he can always say that he will be vindicated sometime in the future. It's like the face-off between gold bulls and bears, but I don't see gold dropping to $10 any time soon.

my guess is - the quiet sideways trading for a couple of weeks meant one of the big mining operations couldn't move coins OTC so they dumped some on market to pay some bills.

Def some selling to drive the price down in order to get a cheap market price from the Feds and in anticipation of more supply. This on the day Expedia announce they'll accept Bitcoin. This is certainly a crazy development. I know the Feds have to announce an auction but the result is kinda reminiscent of when Gordon Brown announced he would be selling off Bank of England gold reserves and the price tanked.

bitcoin doesn't have a futures market. a selloff of a thousand or so bitcoin is hardly the same as some banks manipulating gold on COMEX.
