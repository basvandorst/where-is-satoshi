It's cool man. Not everyone understands the utility of diversification but to each their own. I guess you are one of the "all eggs in one basket" types so I wish you the best of luck.

Ehh the IRS generally doesn't care where you got your money as long as you pay taxes on it. The issue is that banks have to report large transfers (&gt;= $10,000) for anti-money laundering purposes which will usually trigger a freeze and investigation.

US banks are definitely required to report transactions &gt;= $10,000 to the IRS. That is a strict AML law. Structuring is more so at the discretion of the bank to detect and report. However due to the fact that crypto is still used often for illegal activities, large crypto transfers are bound to raise some flags.

There is a right time for everything. Bonds are meant to be long term, low risk investments. The rate of return is greater when interest rates are high which is why now is not the best time to buy. They are still a great investment tool though.

You are comparing a fiat currency to a commodity. Using bitcoin as an asset storage device is a terrible idea. Literally everyday could be another 2008 for you and there is far less of a guarantee of it ever recovering.

It really is not. In fact, I would argue that the energy consumption is one of the better arguments against crypto. As it stands now, bitcoin alone uses somewhere between 2.6GW and 7.7GW [0]. That is not an insignificant amount of power and it expensive economically and environmentally. It is also a problem for the expansion of the network because at some point the cost of energy will be prohibitively expensive to add new mining resources.

You appear to be attacking a straw man. Nowhere did I say that we should stop experimenting. However, the energy consumption of crypto as it exists today is a very clear flaw. And you are also sort of proving my point. 70 billion kWh = 70 TWh. Bitcoin alone used ~32 TWh last year. That is outrageous. One cryptocurrency used only by a small percentage of the population managed to use almost half of the energy required to power the entire internet.

\&gt; 3 million.
There are a lot of cool things about crypto, but it does not scale when it comes to energy. At least not in it's existing form.

I don't know, maybe I am lame, but I don't get excited about the possibility of losing a lot of money. Go look at some mutual funds. They are stable and will make you money. That's where you should invest the most. Yeah, sure, invest in crypto. Play around and have fun but don't put anything in you aren't willing to lose.

That's absolutely false. There is no minimum dollar requirement to open a brokerage account.
