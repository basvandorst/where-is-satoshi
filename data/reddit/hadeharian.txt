Have more options than predecessors, you mean.
Edit: There are a lot of stupid people that are not millennials. I get that. However, making a blanket statement saying ALL Millennials are more informed than ALL other generations living is at least equally incorrect.

Prior to becoming accusatory, you should define your terms. The FBI is a legal entity formed by the U.S. Government for the purpose of law enforcement. Unless you happen to disagree with any of this, then all you're stating is that you don't like them taking things from criminals. Ethics is rooted primarily in authority.
As far as the IRS is concerned, after millions of returns being processed, one would think they'd be pretty good at spotting someone cheating them.
If you don't like these authorities, you certainly have reasonable legal options available.

How did the FBI seize Bitcoin that wasn't theirs?

"Ethics being rooted in authority is a highly contestable claim!"
Most societies I am familiar with have elders of some kind whether they be appointed or elected members of leadership or mere medicine men. Those elders possess some form of authority. If not, people would not look up to them for any reason - they would not form a base from which society continues.
You're right in saying that theft is criminal re-appropriation, but wrong in claiming that legal re-appropriation is criminal.
Clearly, not all government (especially this one) has a monopoly on legislature. I can call a legislator up and suggest a bill and they can bring it to call. I can petition the government for change. I can get enough signature and influence leaders to make things into law. You are confusing the USA (someplace you can suggest law and complain about) with North Korea (someplace you'd already be dead for making such commentary).

It's not though. Some third party needs to trade your native currency for bit coin, unless you're paid in Bitcoin already.
edit: obviously can't type
@_date: 2015-01-11 17:20:14
Did they mine the bitcoins themselves or did they use an exchange. Let's assume no mining for the time being. So they used an exchange then. How did they exchange? Through a third party.

I'm feeling the same. I'm actually very disappointed. And the funny thing is, as the technology matures, it looks like more and more 3rd parties will be needed for bitcoin banking, bitcoin transfers, and other bitcoin type of things. If bitcoin is ever internationally recognized, there will specialty ebanks that will ensure your bitcoin deposit and other similar services.
Overall, I feel like ending the grip of the Federal Reserve is a good thing, but you don't replace that authority with nothing. It's generally a lack of authority and protection that breeds the kind of crime you don't want, like theft. Maybe you don't like drug enforcement and that's fine. Maybe you don't like the government's stance on things or use of money...fine. But who will lead and protect the currency? 
Currently, this is the type of currency that some rogue figure can plan a vulnerability attack weeks in advance and do a distributed scale theft of massive amounts of money. Credit cards systems have mechanisms and checks already built into them. Who the hell is going to care when hacker X uses a zero day exploit on the bitcoin software (or even operating system) that you use and sucks out all your money?
The answer is no one. People will see what happened. They'll document it, and maybe patch it but replacing that hard earned currency...you're on your own pal.
I don't know. Maybe it's not that scary. Maybe you have 1000 wallets and you only use one in any given month and do full wipes of previous data. Losing 1/100th or maybe even 1/10th of what you have doesn't sound that bad...as long as it only happens once.
Tell me why I'm wrong. Be my guest. Just back it up with facts.
@_date: 2015-01-11 18:23:51
And this same thing applies to any currency minus the speed. What you don't get (but maybe you claim) is total anonymity until your network and your vendors and your software is also secure. 
Edit: Spelling. 
Also, I'd like to point out that I can take any currency and hide it. I also can take any currency (think reasonable amounts) and pay for almost any product today. Yes, if I wanted nuclear weapons or anything able to aggressively kill populations, probably the amount of money would be a little hard to move around. I'm not certain why this is a bad thing.
I guess if I was a druggie of some type which the government did not fully approve of (think Schedule 1...go ahead), then maybe there are some processes built into bitcoin that ease transactions. I don't see finding new ways to disregard laws in general as being a solution. There are many systems in need of overhaul, and bitcoin is going to save the world?
I think it might save the richest 1%, because moving large amounts of money around seems like something they would benefit most from. Possibly they have some nice people to help market all of this. I'm sure it also has great ability to help people get rich performing immoral activities. So, if I needed a hitman, I guess bitcoin would be the perfect operative payment system. Maybe I needed to finance some terrorist activities....say against a satire magazine in France. Bitcoin sounds like the opportune mechanism for that.  Imagine I wanted to pay off the Russian military so they'd shoot down a plane? Bitcoin comes to the rescue.
It really is a wonderful tool. I can see how you would be so glad to get rid of all those third parties.

As much as I dislike the Federal Reserve in the US, I also believe that monetary policy has helped things somewhat. Remember he historical times before monetary policy when there were major slumps and skyrocketing economic periods? It would seem that Bitcoin is trying to return us to those times. Bitcoin has no interest rates to encourage economic activity. It does nothing special if the values plummet unexpectedly. If people should ever discover means of circumnavigating algorithm, which government or agency will prosecute?
How would you ever end taxes unless you earn via Bitcoin? How would you ever revolution if government has records of exchange transactions? 
Lastly, demonstrate please for me with REAL examples of how Bitcoin does any of the things you mentioned. Please assume that for these examples no one has income through Bitcoin. In other words, ignore business owners for now.

Alright. Be my guest and kill everyone. You have your consent, and according to you, that's all you need. That's not democracy and neither is what you are talking about. Apparently laws don't apply to you because you never voted on any of them in any formal way. 
Even if you wanted something polycentric, which you think is introducing something new and glamorous, there is still the process of agreement. It always will be a choice by group until such time as a single individual possesses intellect sufficient to entirely trump the masses. 
Even in polycentric, there will be people like you...probably more people like you complaining that it's not fair because the law is distributed unevenly.
I can't wait to hear all the complaining then.
@_date: 2015-05-02 23:04:42
You're thoughtless for:
1) Believing that things aren't your way and then deciding you're being governed illegitimately for it. Just like a spoiled rotten child.
2) Deciding that comparisons aren't worth your analysis, and that name calling is in fact a better solution
3) Calling everything unjust that isn't yours. I'm sure your shit tastes great to you though.
4) Competing legal systems? Let the ol' mongols system compete for a while...won't you? See if you don't like having your women raped and your house burned to the ground. There's no practical way to decide on legal systems dynamically. Every person or group will always want more advantage, and those that are unable to use their voice will be completely alienated again and again.
5) "If individuals could choose they'd still rely on experts to build law" - If you knew fact one about the US, you would know this already happened and more than once.
@_date: 2015-05-02 21:32:42
So why is it illegitimate? Because you were born under the US flag and then decided with some degree of angst that life isn't fair? Is that your legal argument? You decided you didn't like how things were being run. If there was never a dislike for government, nor would there ever be a need for it. Besides that, your hurt feels aren't enough to invalidate anything but individual choices. Government is not an individual choice.
