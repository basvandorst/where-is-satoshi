I'm a seller on LBC. I received these emails since I post my email ID publicly on the ads. The first one was just a blatantly obvious attempt to steal BTC, and the link in the latest one forwards to "localebitcoins.com"
  Gmail did not mark either of these as phishing mails or spam. Just making sure people don't fall for these kind of phishing scams :)

since when is BTC-E located in Tokyo... or anywhere near Japan for that matter... scammers these days just ain't trying hard enough
@_date: 2014-02-04 09:12:43
That is why there is the Mobile/NetBanking method, most Indians end up using this since it works a lot better and is instant. Would be nice if BTC was implemented but very doubtful of this happening in India since the govt does not see it as a currency.

For US people, bank transfer is toxic. It takes 3 days to transfer to different bank and very likely to be coming from hacked account which would result in reversal and/or investigations. If OP is in US, it is best to deal with cash or cash deposits. If Asia/Europe some other place, then bank transfer is good.
@_date: 2014-02-17 06:24:09
either OP is troll or shouldn't be investing
@_date: 2014-02-20 04:44:43
and.. can you guide us where is this trail?
@_date: 2014-04-17 20:53:33
don4of4 is OP.. check his username.. he was the advertiser/seller in this case
@_date: 2014-01-15 04:56:42
This is old news.... It's pretty bad. It's not even based in India and is essentially just a copy of LocalBitcoins but you can't even remove your ad without paying a fee. We need a real exchange in India soon, not this crap. And to make it worse their support staff keeps spamming both the US and Indian sites here...
@_date: 2014-03-04 08:15:25
AFAIK people have had trouble getting money onto BTC-e... so it's like the reverse of the reason why MtGox was consistently higher before....
@_date: 2014-02-19 23:41:40
[LocalBitcoins]( often has traders offering to buy BTC with Amazon Gift Codes in the "sell bitcoins" section. Remember to buy from reputable traders, though :)
@_date: 2014-05-27 21:46:17
Not really, Unocoin is still operating legally since they are paying taxes, as are many of the LocalBitcoins sellers
@_date: 2014-05-28 01:47:50
ohh you use btcxindia? how is that site? I was thinking to sign up for it and go through KYC process but have not really heard much about it
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:01:40
LocalBitcoins hi sahi hai :)
  Unoco.in is also there but it is very new, charges more fees, and takes a while to receive BTC... best to go with a reputed seller on LocalBitcoins
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:58:52
From what I know there were talks about some exchange opening by March. Although with the government procedures in India it is hard to say how long it will all actually take... in the mean time I am making my profits on LocalBitcoins ;P
  Right now it seems that bitcoin entrepreneurs can rake in good profits with the fees and premiums, but once there is more supply, price would naturally go down, they would not be able to charge such high fees anymore. I think realistic time would be in a year, or even more, for all this to happen.
@_date: 2013-11-16 08:48:56
"what company is that? how can it have so much profit? it must be a scam"
@_date: 2013-12-16 11:05:10
They are still charging a premium, and on top of that a 3% transaction fee, just like all of the other BTC purchase/sell websites in India... but hopefully this will let BTC become a bit more mainstream
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:29:30
biryani :D
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:29:20
I've heard about this method but never tried it myself. Seems like there will be way too many fees/exchange rate involved. Cos PayPal gives a horrible USD/INR rate and VirWox you will have to buy Linden Dollars or something first, to get BTC
@_date: 2013-12-09 06:11:42
Problem is that there are still no major exchanges in India, and the few exchanges that are there charge fees of 3% or more. There are people looking to get into it and trade, but are disappointed when they see the large fees.
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:00:46
Right now there are not so many options for us Indians due to not having any proper BTC exchange in the country. If you want to purchase, you can check LocalBitcoins, there are a lot of good sellers who will gladly help you through the process. Most of them accept NEFT/IMPS/RTGS transfer as well as cash deposit options, and would release BTC to you once the transfers are complete. Check sellers' feedbacks and how recently they have been online, and you can figure out who to trust.
  The rate on LocalBitcoins may be a bit high than the rates on the major international exchanges, but it is all a part of the growing pains of BTC in India right now. It will pay off in the future, for sure :)
@_date: 2013-11-24 09:54:20
buysellbitco.in is legit... I am verified with them and made a couple transactions, but I usually stick with coinbase since I have US account too and pricing is better on coinbase
@_date: 2013-12-27 15:02:57
Keep in mind, in a country like India, the poor people don't want to use Bitcoin even if they have the option to. Cash rules everything in India. The very poor who have barely any savings aren't going to be able to earn in BTC and buy their everyday meals with BTC; it's too much of a hassle for them as compared to getting a crisp cash note. BTC is more of a speculative thing for middle-class to rich people only.

Would love a bottle opener so I can spread the word over a few beers :)
  Thank You!

Doesn't work if nobody wants to sell it at that rate, though :P
@_date: 2013-11-11 08:57:49
It should be working, I had used my debit card, and Greendot is supposed to function just as a debit card would.
  I would probably try their online shopping greendot card, I have successfully used it in other websites for verification purposes before
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:20:16
Two factors to note:
  BTCchina had been around since 2011. They only "took over" the markets when they eliminated fees in Sep 2013, and after the news got really big.
  India still has no proper BTC exchanges with low fees... all of the places to buy/sell BTC charge about 3% fee per transfer and not really allow for active trading. The news is getting big about BTC but most people still have no idea how to trade it.
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:32:47
why does this even have upvotes...? this whole sub is such a circlejerk sometimes...

You have to go to the "edit profile" or something, it was pretty tricky but once I uploaded they called me back in a few hours
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:49:24
Bitcoin is not really viewed in India to be a payment method, unfortunately. Even the idea of credit/debit card is fairly young. People go to ATM's and pull out cash for everyday needs, and generally prefer dealing in cash. Even for online shopping, paying via bank transfer (extremely minimal fees involved to the seller, usually just a few cents in USD) or Cash on Delivery is most popular. Bitcoin is more of an investment to most people so far, but maybe it can be changed in the future
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:18:49
Knowing the way things work in India, probably longer than that :( but we can hope to jump on this train soon as possible

according to [RBI rules]( outward remittance for foreign exchange purpose is prohibited... the government would likely reject on this basis
@_date: 2013-12-26 18:20:04
Capital controls... RBI forbids any outward remittance for a variety of purposes, including foreign exchange purpose, and "if we say so" purpose
@_date: 2013-12-09 12:54:31
Of course not. I am not quite foolish enough to release the escrow until I see the money in my account, which is pretty irreversible in India
@_date: 2013-12-21 19:54:50
this is not an exchange, just another version of [buysellbitco.in]( / "indian coinbase" :)
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:59:17
What some people don't realize is that the banking system is quite different in India. Each account has a "home" branch and there are high fees involved in doing banking outside of the home branch or home city. Usually, cash deposits are free in the home branch, but not in the other branches.
  The system in India does allow for very easy transfer between accounts. Online transfer within the bank is usually free. And NEFT transfer between banks takes place every hour and incurs a minimal fee (₹2.50, about 1 cent USD)
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:31:40
Bitcoin: take smartphone which you paid ₹5000 for over to a local food vendor. Food vendor does not own a smartphone, neither accepts bitcoin/mobile payment nor knows what to do with it. You get yelled at for trying to make a fool out of him, and stay hungry from no way to convert that bitcoin into cash.
  Bank account: go to SBI branch which is pretty much everywhere, withdraw money from account (which usually has ₹0 minimum balance for the rural customers), use it to pay for food. Still a hassle, but not that bad. Further, Indian banks give up to 9% interest on FDs and 4% in savings accounts, so banking system is really not that bad.
  What most poor people actually do: stuff a bunch of cash under their mattress and take it out when they need it. For people who are living hand to mouth, this is easiest option.
  I'm certainly not against BTC and I really hope it can be big. But as of now, it is really not appealing in countries like India where cash rules and even credit/debit card usage is low even among upper class. It is merely speculative right now in such countries, among the technical crowd who want to invest for monetary gains

There are capital restictions in India, the government doesn't like INR going out of the country. One has to provide proof/reasons for sending, especially if it is a large amount, and even then there are limits to how much one person can send per year
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:46:54
Though it's possible that it was stolen, chances are that it just got caught in the sorting machines that USPS uses.
  I used to sell a lot of cell phone batteries on eBay and my first mistakes were to send them the way I would send letters, resulting in empty envelopes arriving just the way you described. I later realized you have to pay an extra 20 cents as 'non-sortable' fee
  good on you for encrypting though :)
@_date: 2013-12-21 23:54:48
i have used this site already... yes I know they are partnering with Buttercoin soon... but it is not an exchange.. just able to buy and sell at their rates just like coinbase
@_date: 2013-11-24 10:00:29
If you are in India I recommend to use buysellbitco.in ... pretty easy NEFT transfer once you verify PAN card.. cos none of the major exchanges allow withdrawal to INR very easily so that and inrbtc.com are the only easy ways to go in India
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:46:39
I believe BTCChina was around since way before the recent rise. But it was eliminating the fees in September, that made sudden massive increases in volume (someone can correct me if I am wrong).
  India needs something like this to happen, in order to cause a similar growth.
@_date: 2013-12-27 14:58:38
1) Money laundering is a major issue in India; govt thinks BTC can assist in this
  2) People in China were getting past capital controls by going CNY -&gt; BTC -&gt; USD/other forex. Similar capital controls essentially make outward forex illegal in India, so the govt doesn't want Indians to do what the Chinese were doing
  Indian government has always been aggressive in these matters

You can purchase BTC through Coinbase if you are in US. Then once you have BTC on hand, "send" to the public address on the paper wallet.
  Once you are ready to withdraw, you can import the wallet, for example in Coinbase you would go to account settings -&gt; integrations -&gt; import paper wallet and import using the private key.
  Do note that after importing paper wallet, it is advised to toss the wallet and never use it again -- treat paper wallet like a piggy bank

They are trades for 1e-8 and 8e-8 bitcoins; eg. 0.00000001 and 0.00000008 BTC respectively

The number 4 is unlucky in Chinese culture. Thus the selloff before it reached to 4000 yuan

This website has been around for a while but it is always "out of stock" or "will resume trading later" when there is even a slightly more increased volume than usual. You have to have your own BTC wallet already (which some new adopters may not be familiar how to use). And unfortunately, there is still the 3% fee + premiums on price.
  I do admit it is really easy to buy from here when they have stock, and I had been verified and received my BTC within few hours :)
@_date: 2013-12-22 19:54:23
It is not a scam... I have bought from these guys and they do deliver.. but it does take a while. They are still in limited order stage though so that may be why
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:40:05
Well, BTC is only gaining popularity with the city people, who basically ALL have bank accounts already. The banking system in India is actually fairly efficient, but government regulations and restrictions are sometimes a pain. The government could very well put those restrictions on BTC as well.
  Those who don't have bank accounts in India are usually older people who believe in keeping their money under mattresses, or rural people who don't have much money to begin with. They won't have much faith in any system other than paper money that they can actually spend.

@_date: 2013-12-15 08:32:47
ITT: Ignorant people who know nothing about India, talking about how Indians have no access to anything.
  I don't agree that it is gaining significant popularity in India since there are no major exchanges and it is still very hard to get hands on BTC without paying a premium. And, much like China, India still has a lot of capital controls too.
  But I am an Indian now living in US, and due to it being easier to obtain BTC here, I have been selling BTC to Indians for the past 10 days or so on LocalBitcoins... and within the range of just 10 days I have already sold an equivalent of USD $9000 worth of BTC.
  There are a lot of people genuinely interested in BTC as an investment, much like gold or silver, and there is certainly some potential for it to be a big thing in India-- just not until it is easier to purchase.
@_date: 2013-12-23 04:41:25
Limited to 0.1BTC per day only. Its pretty good pricing but if you want more then buysellbitco.in is still better at this point, and they only ask for PAN card
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:37:50
legally you should be fine. RBI hasn't outlawed BTC itself... they are just trying to find people who are partaking in money laundering operations. people with high qty BTC / people who police can squeeze more money out of would possibly be in risk
@_date: 2013-11-15 10:43:29
Coinbase isn't a scam. It would be the best way to get started with BTC in the US since it is easier than other methods... just the only drawback is their automated "high risk" monitoring system. It never affected me, and I even qualified for the instant buy thing after a week, since I verified my info with them. But someone from Coinbase had posted here that they will whitelist you if you simply email them :) good luck
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:34:34
India is not adopting it very much yet. Clearly it is still not easy to buy at a good rate with low fees, which discourages a lot of people from adopting.
  There has recently been more hype about it, but it is still in very early growth stages in India.... I sell on LocalBitcoins via Indian bank transfers and I get a lot of questions from people just wanting to know more about it since it is so new in India. There are people who end up buying for long-term investment purposes but there is not much more use for it in India at this stage.
@_date: 2013-11-13 00:39:11
It's not Coinbase, it is the public record thing we have in US. Many times the banks ask me these same questions.
  I got denied for 24 hours since I answered to be associated with my address for 5+ years (which is true), but due to my age (21) the "right answer" was 3-4 years... stupid verification system
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:27:38
There are still limits of 0.1 BTC purchase per day :( and the government could very well pressure them to shut down too
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:03:10
I heard Coinbase bases price on Bitstamp. They are always just a bit higher (right now about $20 higher)
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:02:18
You must had NRE account. I have both NRE and NRO accounts and my NRE account has those same limitations due to RBI rules.
  As per RBI rules I can receive deposits into my NRO account but I can't send them back to USA. I have been selling on LocalBitcoins for a while and accepted a lot of deposits through NEFT and cash deposit, but only to my NRO account... it bounces back to the sender if they try to NEFT transfer to my NRE account.
  Do you still have that account with HDFC? If you have an NRE account it's even easier, you can send a transfer to either NRE or NRO and since it's HDFC I would receive it instantly. Feel free to PM me. I am from Mumbai also, but currently staying in USA
