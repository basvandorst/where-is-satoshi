In the Netherlands there is so much anti bitcoin propaganda going on. Incredible. Newspaper says: "Bitcoin is done already".. If it keeps growing.. they say it is a bubble, if it is falling a bit, they say its done. Either way, its always bad.

Even when you can pay with BTC in a restaurant, the owner of that restaurant is going to cash out those bitcoins in fiat immediately. So yeah.. not sure if that's the adoption we want because then BTC is becoming worth less.

@_date: 2019-11-25 18:59:12
It's only 5 months away. First wave up took 6 months. Now only 5 months left for the second wave. Time is running out.
@_date: 2019-08-14 09:12:46
$10.350 is a 61.8 fib retracement level. Besides that, the 4H 200EMA sits there and is only been tested once after a prior 50EMA golden cross over it. This pattern has been going on for over 10 years and never got it wrong. In other words: This means, BOTTOM. Now, of course, nothing is 100%. But I call this the bottom. (yes we can have wicks to 10k, if you want to  trade that, but I think that's risky)

It's just a joke to watch sentiment do a 180° turn after a miniscule daily red candle. First people talk about 14k, 30k, 48k, 100k. Now they only see bears and call for 8.5k, 5k, 3k.. 
Let's see what happens when the opposite is going to happen (again) and the charts write 11.7k again. I bet that they all do moon talks again.
The sentiment is behaving like an emotional house wife that's all over the place. ��

That's the thing about trading. The emotions. First everyone is mooning. Then after a, minor red candle on the daily, doom fud and fear spread like wildfire. Some people even call for 3k again. This market is so immature. The switch from 95% bullish to 95% bearish sentiment in 15 minutes. Incredible.
We could trace back to 10.4k. But we also could do an inverted Bart Simpson pattern. Just watch what happens when we do that. People are changing their bias so fast.
@_date: 2019-08-14 09:15:06
Why would you sell at the bottom of the channel, at a 61.8% fib retrace from the top *and* at the 200EMA which always, in a ten year long cycle, acted as the reversal point after a 50EMA golden cross? :) I think 'whales' already played.

Stupid panic started when we weren't able to break 12k. It starts with a hand full of people and then people parrot their fud and fear. It's a perfect reflection of the society nowadays.
One man says "yo this place is the bomb! ��" at a city square full of people and suddenly all hell breaks loose because a paranoid emotional housewife heard the word bomb.
Just look at reddit, how fast bias changes from bull to bear overnight. One day $100k is predicted before end of year, and like now, one day later they scream like little pigs in a fire: we will fall to $2k.
I got to say, these swings.. They get worse. this is one of the biggest flaws of humans. Copy machines.

Miners selling? Meh, i don't think it's in their benefit to crash the market lower. If you mine, you know that the halving is coming up.
Only entities that can't wait, dump their btc. And i can only think of one kind of group that would be in such hurry... scammers

@_date: 2019-08-21 10:10:47
Its the ones that use the exchanges. Doesn't matter where the exchanges are. I'm European and use USA exchanges as well. And the Asians were awake while the rest was sleeping or late night, like the last 3 massive dumps in the past weeks. It happens constantly  during Asian work hours. Straight consecutive red candles. No retrace. Until work hours are over.
That tells me something.

Working on a historical 16th 4H red candle in a row, we fall $100 per coin per hour on average. Keeping this insane rate means bitcoin will be  worth $0 within in 4 days. Just to give an perspective of how fast we're actually dropping.
Stop panic selling. (or are those  Chinese scammers still dumping their 45k of stolen bitcoin on binance and bitfinex?)

You probably refer to ASIC mining. But not all coins can be mined with ASIC. And on top of that, ASIC are specificly designed. I don't think there are enough chips to mine all crypto with ASIC chips. GPU mining is here to stay, and the manufactures should respond to that.
@_date: 2018-02-27 08:14:18
Maybe they should crank up production? I think GPU mining is here to stay. Of course this will take time. But it really isn't miner's fault :). You can't blame the customers of a supermarket if after months .. the racks are still empty. Something is going wrong with the production to adjust to  demand.
These companies made a lot of money over the years. I blame them for not taking a risk and produce more.

Still in play. Don't laugh too hard yet ��

This post (end following daily discussion) should be pinned to stick at the top.
@_date: 2019-09-25 08:02:50
Well, good time to buy now then ��
@_date: 2019-09-30 17:08:04
This is getting weird
@_date: 2019-09-13 11:48:43
I don't think so. But guess what he's doing right now. Fud talk to buy in cheap
@_date: 2019-09-25 08:02:09
Hopium: if we stay above 8k, strong hidden bullish divergence forming on 1h and 4h chart.

You can't say that it is a bad timing if you bought in at a recovery point around $15k because $15k was after a 'crash' of 25%. You can't know the future. It kept going down. and down and even more down. If there wasn't a Mt.Gox hack, the market would've been around $30k and maybe never return. So, getting in at $15k wasn't really that bad.
I got in at $5.5k btw. So i'm not defending my own trades.

Yes. Look at October 2013. Thank me later

If we all just keep searching for doom, we will find it for sure. It becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.

Totally different.. Different RSI.. (pre-slope is up, instead of slope down). Also different entry price levels
@_date: 2019-09-26 20:39:01
It's not really  that low.
@_date: 2019-09-27 08:45:13
From the future: buy now, sell at $390k
@_date: 2018-07-16 10:47:13
I forgot we could go up too
@_date: 2019-09-25 04:52:33
It's down 40% from last macro high. If btc closes lower than this, the bull trend is over. In the past bull trends we always drop about 35% to 40% before the next rally. So that's where the hopium is right now. :)

In a year you will be glad you bought it there

Impatient btc traders decided to trade alts instead of btc. That's my explanation for the current alt rally. I'm not falling for it. 
Just wait and see those alt gains flow into btc once btc breaks out of this pattern. Nobody dares to trade btc at the moment.

Debt to who exactly? To those who print money from thin air? Fuck them.
@_date: 2019-09-25 08:29:50
"this is a suckers rally"
Wait and see. 100% gain within 4 weeks

I do not have the luxery of having parents
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:27:58
YES .. this was what I was thinking about today when I heard another nono housewife shitting on crypto.
@_date: 2019-09-27 08:14:14
Everything below the daily 200ma is a steal
@_date: 2018-12-03 19:28:12
A spike to $100k is also *possible*
@_date: 2019-05-29 19:14:22
Buy high sell low is your way? We're up so hard. 2 weekly candles closed completely above Bollinger Bands. Something that only happened 1 time before in 2014.
I sold some of my btc to buy in a little lower again. It's okay if you call me stupid. I've learned from my greed in Dec. 2017.
@_date: 2018-12-04 10:00:50
I posted my comment because everything is speculation. Price could drop to $10 and rise to $100k.. When? Not sure.. but all the speculation is not worth the effort :D
