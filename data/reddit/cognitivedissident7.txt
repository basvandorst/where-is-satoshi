Don't say they were for SR. Do you even opsec bro? 
@_date: 2018-09-17 12:55:54
Speculative investment, interest in the tech, whatever you can think of that's not a felony
@_date: 2018-09-17 16:11:55
It wouldn't necessarily I guess but the majority of things for sale on SR would be felonies. 
@_date: 2018-09-18 16:29:07
Depending on what steps you took to obscure what you were doing it may be possible but I wouldn't worry about it. If anyone says anything just say you were buying ebooks and hacked porn accounts or something. You definitely won't get in trouble at this point.

I've heard you can get 25+% if you're willing to wait a little.

Poor Ross.

United States. One glaring example of the failure of democracy to keep the government in check would be the war on drugs. Or basically every war the US has ever fought in
@_date: 2017-02-26 22:30:28
It doesn't seem to be doing a good job.
@_date: 2017-02-26 17:52:08
I don't agree with that. Rejection of government is a rejection of coercion. If groups of people are making good decisions then they won't have to enforce their ideas at gunpoint. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 16:38:15
Why is it wrong? 
@_date: 2017-02-26 17:49:34
Governments already do all of those things.

Fiat is government money

You won't.

Didn't his father go to prison for tax protesting? Pretty honorable thing to go to prison for imo.
@_date: 2017-01-07 18:21:28
My point was that while your claim that Irwin Schiff is a "lying cheating scumbag" might be accurate, that what he went to prison for speaks highly of his character. 
All the Jews I know are nice and generous people.

Yeah I know I was just saying that because posts like this never seem to pan out. Also I was hoping you would prove me wrong. Based on the number of upvotes you have now, the tx fee will be the most expensive part of your plan.

Actually I bet books have killed at least as many people as drugs - mien kamph, the communist manifesto, the bible and the quran come to mind.

If you take a bad idea and put it on a blockchain that doesn't make it a good idea. 
@_date: 2016-11-08 16:19:48
If you can't get people to pay for something without pointing guns at them then maybe it isn't such a good thing. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:47:51


That would stop plenty of people. 
@_date: 2016-11-08 15:01:50
Maybe governments in general are a bad idea. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:20:38
It would deter people just by making it more complicated. If you couldn't just make an account on coinbase and have bitcoin relatively simply plenty of people just wouldn't bother. 
@_date: 2016-11-07 21:31:46
well at least if trump wins I'll be able to take consolation in my .001 btc

Carlos Slim isn't the wealthiest person anymore.

Also the bitcoin won't necessarily be tied to your identity.

I can't wait until they are on sale (:

 Those comments are hard to read. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 03:29:43
I'm not even reading other people's comments. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:25:46
Honestly it's been going up so fast it's unnerving. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 20:22:07
 Is there another kind of politician? 
@_date: 2017-04-03 03:20:00
If the government demands tribute from you try paying them in something besides usd.
@_date: 2017-04-03 02:06:59
You couldn't really have fiat money without centralized power. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 02:30:15
It says right on the note "legal tender for all debts public and private"
@_date: 2017-04-25 14:46:54
 How convenient. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 02:39:46
Fiat is an order or decree, fiat money is money by decree not because it has good monetary properties. I don't know how to put it more simply. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 02:23:18
You need a centralized power structure to force people to use fiat money. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:36:23
SR circumvented drug cartels. The government enables cartels by keeping drugs illegal, thus creating a high profit margin for anyone willing to break the law and provide people with the drugs they want to buy. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:03:45
Nope. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:53:29
I wish the government would forcefully give me money. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:58:18
If the gov bailed me out they'd never see me again.

It's more like 10 million a year. Still terrible but you're an order of magnitude off.
