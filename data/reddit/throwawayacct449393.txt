Basically south korean exchanges are being used to buy BCH. The reason is because Chinese government "banned" bitcoin so the chinese are moving their money into BCH because it isn't banned. Strange logic but that is what is happening.

It survived but the problem is that BCH is still up big time. It was $500 at the beginning of Nov and now it is at $1,200 so BCH still managed to get a major inflow of capital. That 20 billion of market cap should be in bitcoin! not BCH!
IMO, the problem is everyone is not fully committed to bitcoin. We still have a lot of people who play both sides of the fence. If you still have your forked BCH coins, you need to get rid of them. You are only hurting BTC by holding them! More attacks will come as BCH's market cap grows bigger! We need to defeat them quickly by driving the price down to zero! Sell your BCH if you have it!!!

I went to bch when it was 600 something  . I like bch because of the p2p cash aspect of it. Btc seems to be mutating into something like gold. I might buy back in if the network gets upgraded to handle more capacity.

Free market capitalism should be the hand that decides the fate of coins.

The only reason they survive is because the overall market cap of all coins is increasing. A rising tide lifts all boats. What clears them out is when there is a major sell offs. The big coins will all survive but the smaller coins will just see an exodus until they die off completely.
