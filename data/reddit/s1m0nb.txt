Actually there are multiple implementations of LN. You got one from Lightning Labs, LND which is to my understanding commercial and not open source. And there is a team of MIT working on LIT and partially open source. But correct if I'm wrong

It usually does the exact opposite of what I think, but my guess is we will see another low in August. Would suggest slowly (re-) enter the market and stay focused on the projects you think are worth it...
