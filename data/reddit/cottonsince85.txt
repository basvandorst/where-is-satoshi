you know what is annoying is they are saying that btc has pulled off its high of $20k down to $15k, if you look at cryptocurrency total market it is still currently at its all time high. people are just changing their coin holdings and diversifying. BTC is actually posed for another run up as is sheds a little marketshare. people need to get in now before the crypto market doubles again and btc is the safest bet there is.

This is actually a great argument. Someone who is 50-60 years old putting in 2-5% might be putting in years of what it would take them to make back(a higher % of the rest of their life). You are in at 90% but would only take 6 months(low % of the rest of yours).
90% might still be too risky, especially because it is just an assumption that you will have work available for the next 6 months and won't need that money for something else should you lose most of it because you aren't diversified managing risk.
All in all though it demonstrates that different % of net worth makes a big difference as far as risk based on other circumstances of the individuals life (age and assumed income).

crypto market is at an all time high. people are still putting in money just diversifying into different coins

You should join r/financialIndependence subreddit it will help you in the long run when you find good content there. I recommend adding it to your feed and seeing what pops up. Let it soak in over time, no need to read a bunch right away and then never look at it again. Just let some of the top posts pop up on your feed every now and again. It'll mean more at different stages in your life so it's important to see it over a long period of time.

I didn't make any price predictions at all. My point was the notion that 20% is too much is ridiculous based on the number of people who are already holding well over that. Unless you are recommending a major selloff of people who's investment has already grown to major highs. Crypto might go down it might go up, I'd recommend putting in at least 5-20% right now if it goes down I'd rebuy back to 5-20% level, if it went up I'd evaluation at that time whether I wanted to sell off. Personally I'd start to get uncomfortable if my crypto holdings tripled and my 20% became over 50%. Whether crypto goes up or down people should have 5-20% in that asset class. 
Edit. Also i said diversified crypto not btc, but a majority of it should be in btc being that it is the crypto with largest marketcap and its price will effect all cryptos.
Edit. Also crypto might go down and all my other investments might lose even more, at that point i might want to reevaluate and divest a little from crypto, but as a starting point getting in I still recommend 5-20%.

If you started this year with 2% of your money in BTC and 90% in the sp500 you would now have almost 20% of your holdings in BTC. And this is while BTC is -30% off its high of $20,000 USD.
That is just this year. If everyone hodling sold to 20% their net worth there would be a major pull back and possibly a panic selloff to follow.

I said 5-20% in diversified cryptos put in over a period of time, not btc. There is no guarantee that the dollar or other fiat currencies won't crash. Having 80%+ in American sp500 and American Bonds or US Currency is harmful advise. People need to have some money in S&amp;P Global 1200, Precious metals(gold, silver, platinum), and some(5-20% imo) in crypto. Anyone who is not invested in Crypto should the global economy collapse as it very well could won't have anything. The sooner everyone(or almost everyone) switches a healthy amount of their wealth into crypto the better off the global economy will be. 
edit. also diminishing btc to an extremely volatile speculative asset is very short sighted, although you're not wrong.

I might try and argue bch undeniably came into my ownership at the time of the fork then, on 8/1/17, as I had every right to those bch at that point even if they weren't yet accessable. But probably better safe then sorry and wait the extra 4 months.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:41:36
This is pretty funny cause I think bitcoins appeals to both extremes Libertarian and Socialists.
Libertarian because they don't trust the Fed and Government.
Socialists because they don't trust banks(fed) and Capitalism(gov).
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:01:49
Yes they should, anyone who wants to hedge against fiat should. At minimum everyone should have 5-20% of their net worth in diversified crypto, and a majority of that in BTC for now.

Oh i see you were replying to the 20% figure. Yeah I completely agree 20% is not irresponsible at all, especially if you are prepared to see it swing up and down. If anything not having a some in crypto is irresponsible, imo.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:51:53
Hmm and if I were to download my bch I can't claim it? It is registered to a coinbase address? 
In that case I guess I agree with you completely, until Coinbase or your exchange gift them to you, under those terms ownership wouldn't start until they support them.
Does that apply to even btc you hold on their exchange? If I hold coin on their account do long term gains not start until after I pull them off the exchange into my wallet and would I need to pay any short term gains when I do that for any increase in value?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:26:53
How exactly did the bch fork work? If I were to pull my btc off into my personal wallet could I have claimed the bch? If not I might say I was the legal owner and if needed I could have sued for my exchange to transfer ownership and they would have been obligated anytime, as it was I opted not to and allowed the exchange to hold it until they functionally allowed me to access the property.

I was fomo @ $5400usd:1BTC. Glad I got in. Looking forward to buying this dip in the next day or so.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:56:16
On my taxes i would think of a fork as a stock split and long term gains as the equivalent of 1 year from the time I purchased the bitcoin that forked. 
Not sure if this is anyway accurate.

If you are in top 1%, invest 5% Of-Net-Worth
If you are in top 15%, invest 10% ONW
If you are in top 50%, invest 15-20% ONW
Everyone else, 15-20%+ ONW
The more $$ you have in fiat the better that system works for you, if you are losing in fiat you should have a higher stake in crypto.
Stick with the top 20 coins with a majority in the top 1(BTC), buy in over time not all at once, have a bit of money available to buy the dip.
If your crypto goes up rebalance your investment overtime(ideally sell on a high not a dip). Have a small percentage in metal(gold silver) and hard assets(realestate), and then a comfortable split between equity and bonds with the rest.
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:32:59
let say for example someone is worth $100k. the high end of what i proposed is $20k in crypto, if you take btc/cryptos-market-cap about 33% of that in btc, lets say 40% to skew investment towards btc. That is $6,000 invest in BTC, bought in over a period of time(lets say 6-12 months which is aggressive). 
divesting $500-1000 a month over the next 12 months into bitcoin from equities/bonds/cash/real estate is not malicious or harmful. It's actually very sound advice.

If I'm buying artwork on an online auction, do I own the item as soon as my transaction is confirmed and I won the auction or do I need to wait until the piece of art physically shows up on my doorstep?

Yup, just before in explodes to $40k

Risk tolerance doesn't make it responsible. I might be ok with losing my home in the event of a crypto crash, but it's not responsible to move back in with my parents for gambling(investing).
