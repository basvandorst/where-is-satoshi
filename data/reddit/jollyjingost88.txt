I hardly knew sh*t. But stakes are high now so if someone demonstrates an absolutely astronomical level of ignorance I encourage them to stay on the sidelines until they do their due diligence, both for their own good and for bitcoin's good as well (viz., so ignorant people losing their money or some such don't do reputational damage to bitcoin).

However, at least according to some tax experts, each fork is taxable. So if there are 40 forks next year you could be on the hook for them even if you haven't sold yet.

Additionally, long term hodling in conjunction with dollar cost averaging is greatly advantageous from a tax perspective; you're liable to have more wealth vs. trying to time the market, selling on FUD, etc.

Arguably, there is no such thing as intrinsic value, and value is always a function of people's minds. What value is there in a shiny hunk of metal? That it happens to have certain uses for us at present? One might say it is us *deciding* that since it has certain uses that therefore it is valuable, rather than that value being a necessary (inherent, intrinsic) property of the metal itself.

Media coverage is beginning to become more balanced, as evinced by Mike Novogratz, Tom Lee, the Winklevii, etc. getting more air time and the increased curiosity in the media as to whether this might be an emerging asset class that isn't going away.
Of course, we already know it is, but they're at least wondering now.

I think there are plenty of altcoins with at least the *potential* to use blockchain technology to contribute to global commerce in various ways that Bitcoin plausibly won't, and they should continue to develop going forward -- many have mainnet releases next year, for example.
I don't want to give specifics so that I'm not labeled a shill.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:18:27
I don't rule out the possibility of some altcoin usurping BTC. But I think the obsession with upgrading it NOW, RIGHT AWAY OMG is driven by short-termism that will harm rather than help the project rather than the deliberate, long-term focus of current development.

I'm a bit concerned by this subcommunity's quasi-religious obsession with lightning. 
Is it exciting? Sure. But do we really know how much of an impact it will have and if it is indeed a magical tonic to certain of the BTC network's limitations? That remains to be seen. See, e.g., the low segwit adoption rates for the risks of heralding the "next coming" and putting all our hope on one scaling approach.

Every single sale of BTC or conversion from BTC to another coin (and back!) is a taxable event at income tax rates, which is: 1) a nightmare to keep track of, and 2) far worse than the capital gains rates which would be applied to long term hodlings (e.g., if your income falls under the first two tax brackets -- 10% and 15% -- capitals gains tax = 0%).
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:50:09
They can be related if one's valuation model of BTC is something like Metcalfe's Law (the value of a network is the square of the number of participants). 
Intuitively, this doesn't seem unreasonable; BTC and the internet are both networks, just one happens to have an easily discerned value attached.
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:09:26
I don't believe I ever indicated as such. I hope as many people as possible test lightning and that it is a tremendous success. 
I'd say I'm making a meta-comment on the steady stream of lightning commentary on this reddit as if it is a sure thing, putting all our scaling eggs in one basket for what is an entirely unproven, proprietary solution.
One motivation for taking a more cautious approach to analyzing this potential scaling solution (and others) is that if the hivemind overhypes it, reputational damage to BTC may occur if it fails to meet perhaps unrealistic expectations.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:51:05
I don't know that you can quantify such subjective, qualitative properties of the asset. For example, some of the properties may have 0 value for some people and rather a lot for others.

The BTC network is extremely valuable even if it never gets a single upgrade going forward, in my estimation. The most secure financial network ever built functioning as digital gold? I mean, that's not so bad. 
Perhaps short-term thinking and obsession with USD (and other fiat) profits is blinding people to this reality.

Energy utilization needs to be constrained in some fashion because of the huge negative externality it produces which all too often isn't taken account of -- pollution. 
So it's a more a case of "live and let kill everyone" rather than "live and let live" if we are to take your thinking on its face.

The last few years I've been payed less than the minimum wage in many states when all the hours I work are considered (military), yet have budgeted, saved, invested, and hodled for years and reaped epic benefits.
So I'm not sure I agree that the crypto world is for those who already have wealth. Is it easier for them? Sure, just like everything else in a capitalist system. But smart members of other economic classes can partake in the revolution as well.

He is 100% correct.  The Satoshi team didn't just magically start protocol development at the advent of the crisis; BTC was the culmination of a quest for digital money with a lengthy history behind it.
That it was completed when it was is very poignant, however.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:45:11

Sure, and I have no idea whether the valuation model is more or less correct or not. But it's at least some sort of rational justification for the common internet analogy, in conjunction with other shared properties (e.g., both are disruptive tech protocols).
We'll see I guess.
@_date: 2018-09-19 19:44:23
I already use less than I would due to the very sort of policy I mentioned as necessary, e.g., gas tax. As do you.
Look up the concept of negative externality to get something of the problem of unrestrained energy use (assuming it's mostly non-renewable, which is indeed the case now).
Finally, I have an electric car and am transitioning (very slowly) to solar utilization for my propertty; so it's fair to say I'm at least trying.

Couldn't one just write some poetry then? Personal and profound.  Yet I think we should do more than personally edifying activities which is why I'm tying to understand the benefit of each additional node to the network. Admittedly I'm asking rather than doing indepth research...
@_date: 2018-08-17 14:39:51
Yes, that makes sense.
Is there some cost associated with increased node count? Don't all nodes need to confirm transactions and consequently if there were, say, 1 million nodes, a transaction would take longer to propagate the network? Aren't there costs associated with nodes trying to connect to an ever larger body of fellow nodes?

Personal finance and investing should be taught in schools, to be sure. It seems obvious to me that basic public education ought to produce citizens who know how to pay taxes, let alone build wealth.
On the other hand, plenty of people (including me) weren't taught a thing about it but still found our way, so clearly there is a sense in which the onus is on individuals to learn.
@_date: 2018-08-18 15:55:58
That was my understanding. And risking transition to a deflationary system seems less logical than tweaking the system we have now, e.g., getting real incomes up and getting more of the populace to invest in capital assets so they can be exposed to the wealth creation typically reserved for the wealthy.

BTC is unusable as a currency at present. A lack of scaling in conjunction with unfavorable tax treatment (as far as being a currency goes) means that shoving BTC into the limelight when it isn't ready yet could be very counterproductive when millions attempt to use it and fail.  
That being said, I'm excited for BTC's future.  I'm just voicing what I think are rational concerns about this news.

If you had them in a multisig vault, you can use a tool to get them out and to a BCH-accepting exchange them dump them. PM me or more info, I just did his myself yesterday (after assuming I had missed my chance to dump at a good price after the post-fork drop).
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:12:23
Great question. I've been mulling over the issue myself lately.
1. The increased volume at the derivatives level plus traders taking advantage of arbitrage (as described by the other comment) should have a significant impact on price, in whatever direction trader sentiment is pointing.
2. Additionally, because futures enable you to hedge, there will be less risk in buying the underlying asset. With huge amounts of volume driving the cost of "insuring" BTC purchases down (by shorting futures, which makes you money if it goes down), more people are liable to buy.
3. What I haven't seen addressed is the risk of large players manipulating the price via perpetual shorting as, so some think, occurs with gold. Can banks now simply issue huge amounts of shorts and drive down the BTC price in perpetuity?
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:45:59

Old school finance types might not understand the paradigm shift that BTC and crypto could represent, but:
1. That doesn't mean BTC and crypto will be paradigm shifts. For example, BTC utilization rates and actual utility remain wanting. After a decade BTC still does not scale in the slightest and any attempt at widespread utilization will grind to a halt.
2. Old school finance types might still have insight into whether an ETF will be approved, because that is an old school finance process being implemented by their old school finance type friends/associates.

1. The percentage of people who are millionaires in the US is not equivalent to any given individual's chance of *becoming* a millionaire. 
2. Even if one considers the 3% as a sort of baseline probability, any individual can greatly bump up their chances above baseline by having a high savings rate, investing properly, and generally being smart with money. I'd say the chances are much higher (almost guaranteed) for an individual who saves and invests through their working life.
3. That's not to say chance and circumstance don't play a role in all this.

Isn't the incentive structure set up such that economic actors ought to "be" on both chains? E.g., an exchange doesn't know which chain will prevail and thus enables buying/selling tokens from either chain until the preponderance of hash power sides with one chain.
If that's true then the this is still a MASF in the sense that the economic actors are going to stay neutral (by maintaining a presence on both chains) while the miners decide which chain survives.
Oh, and do we have any sort of metrics whatever for measuring what the 'economic majority' is leaning toward? Obviously, node count isn't demonstrative. It seems like we're just rushing into a permanent chain split without definitive data to guide us.

Your opinion is more nuanced than what one might read from your initial post; I agree that seeking external input is important and would add that that's what we are all doing to some degree (for me, it's taking more tech-savvy peoples' word on certain matters).
