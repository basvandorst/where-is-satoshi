I disagree. The guy has had his car "listed for sale" for NINE FUCKING MONTHS on Open Bazaar, and just now he found out that the listing isn't even showing. In my opinion "Duh, why muh car not sellin? Duh?" summed it up perfectly. 


I am trying to let him know that he is doing something that is obviously stupid and quite likely dangerous. You are letting him proceed. I am comfortable with my decision and methodology.

I can not discern what point you are trying to make with this word salad. Could you please try to explain this more clearly?


So there is no point to differentiate.

This is a FACT.

Question A is Non Sequitor, which I have already stated. 
My answer to question B is of course. However, most of what can be gathered, if being done without a warrant would not be admissible in court. This is why intentionally signing your name on the Tor warrant is, in my opinion, not very smart, as it makes pretty much everything that can be gathered about you in any way admissible in court, AND puts you on a "PLEASE look at me" list.
Again, if you are not scared by such trivial things, go right ahead and pretend that Tor is hiding your activities.

When admitting something in a discussion, it is customary to actually do that. Seriously. 
To move this discussion along, I am going to assume that you are attempting to admit that Gold is actually a Metal and not a Pyramid Scheme, as you had claimed, and proceed to attempt to offer  an answer to this:


Gold and Fiat Currencies are not the same thing, and are not interchangeable, therefore I can not replace Gold with Fiat. 


Ponzi Schemes and Pyramid Schemes are not the same thing. I never even mentioned Ponzi Schemes at all.
 Seeing as you seem to have drifted off to Satoshi's Comet and lost your bearings, I will kindly re-post what you were attempting to defend, for your convenience.


 Again, I will assume that you have conceded that metals are not Pyramid Schemes, and that you are now only trying to prove that Bitcoin is not any more of a Pyramid Scheme than "any countries' fiat currency". Please proceed.

This appears to a an accumulator address after some manual shuffling. From here they are being sent to a variety of sites, including the [Ponzi site btc2x]( for some final scrubbing. I suspect that some of the destinations from this address may also be exchanges. After bouncing them in and out of some gambling/ponzi sites they will effectively be spendable. If some of the outputs from this address can be linked to someone via an exchange account or such, it might very well be the connection needed to identify the hacker(s).

The thread title is about "differences between bitcoin and onecoin".

Incorrect. 30 BTC are confirmed so far to have gone to OKcoin. Another ~450 have gone to other unidentified Exchanges/Gambling sites. There is at minimum 876 BTC from the Bitfinex hack heading to the market as I type this. When that is cashed out they will  likely start moving another ~1,000 or so at a time until all 120,000 Bitcoins have been dumped into the market.


My boat potentially has 6,000 Bitcoins in it from the 5%/120,000 BTC bounty offered by Bitfinex for these coins that I am tracking. Probably nothing compared to your fat stash, but I think it is worthy of pursuit, unlike you who doesn't care about such trivial matters. 
I have discovered something else that I have not yet proven conclusively, but if it pans out, it may very well be the link to the hacker. Stay tuned.

If the idea is to get more people who do not understand Bitcoin -and keep them that way, to invest money in Bitcoin, your suggestions about dumbing down all of the terminology used for Bitcoin are perfectly valid ideas. 


Wrong. It isn't the same thing at all. All you have when you purchase Bitcoin is proof of access. The Bitcoin is on the Blockchain, I thought we already discussed this. There is also no guarantee that someone else does not have it as well, AND, he may have an equal or superior claim to that access.
If 2 people have the key to some Bitcoins, whose are they? Has fraud occurred? If one person paid for that key and the other did not, what then? What if they both paid? What if the same person paid for the same key twice? What if neither paid, but just randomly typed in the code ? It goes on and on. 
 Money on ledger, and hence Credit Cards, is associated with a person's identity.  I thought this was common knowledge to Bitcoiners? The Idealists, anyways. Someone other than the registered account holder(s) accessing the account =fraud in the form of impersonating an account holder, and then  any theft or fraud they may do after that are crimes as well.
You want to think that the laws and underlying moral structure are the same between Banking and Bitcoin, and it simply is not the case. I have actually been under the impression that this was one of the main ideas for Bitcoin.

Bitfinex issued a 5% reward bounty for any coins recovered from the hack. Anyone who can correctly identify the hacker and link him to the coins might contact the hacker and negotiate a higher offer to stay quiet.  I personally suspect that this was an inside job, which is why they offered only 5%, which is a ridiculously low bounty.

Your list is the one I have been using, thank you for providing it. I even linked to it a couple of times so that others can confirm my findings. Every address I have checked from it so far HAS moved, and has moved to this address: 14We1bbHqPhT1iFrJAoEw772GraB8XKN9D .  
I implore every person reading this to check for themselves. I will demonstrate the path of the coins from the first address (1D38A8TJHAQfEGdoirE1WpXPEh7NMNHT5L) from your list as an example. Here goes:
[Here is the first address listed by Chris]( It is now empty. This means the coins have moved. 
[Second shuffle address]( Many groups were moved to this address and combined, then 93 BTC moved all at once.
[Third]( 93 in 93 out.
[Fourth]( 15 more were added, this group is now 108 BTC. From here they are divided, I will follow the largest group, which is 42 BTC
[Fifth]( Here they are divided again, from here I am following the largest group- 16 BTC
[Sixth]( 16 in 16 out,with a small amount shaved off.
[Seventh]( 15.7 in 15.7 out.
[Eighth]( again, all in , all out, with 1.8 shaved off and sent to another shuffle address.
[Ninth]( 13.9 in, 13.9 out, with .4 being returned to the shuffle and 13.5 continuing onward.
[Tenth]( All in, all out with  11.6 continuing onward, the rest returned to the shuffle.
[Eleventh](  11.6 arrive, 11 sent forward, .6 returned to the shuffle.
[Twelfth]( 11 in, 10.8 sent forward
[Thirteenth]( 10.8 in, 8.3 sent forward, 2.5 returned to the shuffle
[Fourteenth]( 8.3 in, 8.2 sent forward
[Fifteenth]( 8.2 in. These are divided. I will follow the larger group of 4.6
[We are now at the accumulator address 14We1bbHqPhT1iFrJAoEw772GraB8XKN9D](
The coins HAVE moved, and every one I have traced ends up here, where they are then sent to a variety of sites which all appear to be Gambling /Ponzi sites and at least one Exchange, OKcoin.
Edit to add: I will kindly accept the reward from you fine folks at Bitfinex right now. No other thanks for doing your fucking job is necessary.

Since then I have been away from the Crypto scene for the most part, so I am open to advice on the best tracing tools available now.

You would need to know the address of the altcoin withdrawal to keep track of it at that point. This is something that only the criminal and exchange would know for sure. If the altcoin used was Dash/Monero/Zcash or similar the trail would be basically impossible to follow. The key would be getting exchanges to actually give a shit and stop this dumping before this is done, but I doubt we are going to see that. We shall see.

You are all over the place here, my good man. Never mind the fact that Bitcoin's record for security is an absolute fucking joke, if that was what we were discussing, which we are not. 


What does this have to do with whether Bitcoin is useful to those who wish to implement a Cashless Society? You are just tossing out random items with no proof that may or may not be true, but  regardless, have no bearing on what you were attempting to prove.


Again, Bitcoin is not decentralized, you admitted this in this very same post.

@_date: 2017-02-19 13:29:53
I understand governance quite well. I also understand that The Powers That Be are indeed pushing for a cashless society- but they need exceptions and ways around this for a variety of reasons. 
Traditional Governments derive power primarily through oppression. Without something to oppress, they can not be the oppressors, and therefore lose their "right to rule". Therefore it is essential to their power base that something exist that they can oppress. This is especially important in a "free" society, where they must not force the oppression upon the population, but rather entice them to ask for it. This is done by creating the problem for which the solution the Powers That Be desires is asked for.
Let's look at one big "problem" for which people demand to be oppressed in response of : Illicit Drugs. And, for simplicity, I am going to frame this in the context of the United States, but this same idea translates to any "free" country. In a cashless society how would the Illicit Drug trade function? Put simply, it wouldn't. That would pretty much be over, on a large scale, anyways. Point of sale transactions would all be tracked and therefore not feasible for illegal activities, and transferring the Profits back to the source would be out of the question as well. Kaput. No More Drug War. No more mass oppression, no more huge profits for the Drug War Machine. All Gone. 
Well, how can you have people demand that the Powers That Be throw the Constitution out the window and literally wage war with military hardware and tactics against the population if there is no Drug Problem to wage war against? You can't. But, this is something that is essential to their power base. Therefore, they need a way for the Drug Problem to keep functioning after they have put in a cashless system. What is required for this to work is a method of payment outside of the Cashless Monetary System. Bitcoin (or something similar with better functionality) fits the bill perfectly. Drugs can be purchased on the QT with this system (Although  the PTB can trace it if they really want to), and profits can be transferred back to whomever is doing the importing and distributing- whether that be separate entities or dark government programs does not matter. Drug Problem assured to keep functioning exactly as they need.
Again, if the Powers That Be did not invent Bitcoin, they must be laughing until they piss their fucking pants that someone did it for them.

"Not being centrally controlled" does not negate any of the purposes for Bitcoin in implementing a Cashless Society. It fits myriad purposes perfectly for their agenda. The idea was to prove that it was a weapon against the Powers That Be in implementing a Cashless Society and it's accompanying Tyrrany, not that it is a good Tool for them to pull it off. 
Not that it affects the usefulness of Bitcoin to serve those implementing a Cashless Society, but I would also like to point out that Bitcoin actually is centrally controlled. Right now you have two very small groups of people publicly vying for their version of Bitcoin to be the one chosen by the actual central controllers: The Miners. At best there is a quasi-representative governance of Bitcoin, at worst it is a Dictatorship. What it isn't is  de-centralized.
@_date: 2017-02-22 20:59:56
As far as I know, nothing- short of the coins being "blacklisted" by exchanges, which does not seem to be the case. I presume that is what will happen to a lot of these (being exchanged for alts). Most exchanges allow for BTC&gt;alt accounts with no identity verification at all. The way he will get identified is if some of these coins get transferred to an account that is BTC&gt;$. You would think he is smarter than that, but who knows?

Please explain how painstaking Blockchain analysis conclusively proving that 120,000 stolen Bitcoins have begun heading to exchanges is "Fake News". 
What I am doing is what every person who has a stake in Bitcoin should be doing. Instead most seem to be content with buying Magic Beans that will somehow make them rich without lifting a finger and could care less about the actual dynamics at play, even when they could kill their Magic Beanstalks.

Yesterday I posted [news that the 876 Bitcoins of 120,000 Bitcoins stolen from Bitfinex that started moving last month]( were currently being shuffled around and accumulating at address  [14We1bbHqPhT1iFrJAoEw772GraB8XKN9D]( , after which they were being moved to various sites, one of which I identified as being the [Ponzi site btc2x]( , and what appeared to be other Ponzi/gambling sites and exchanges.
 For those unacquainted with Bitcoin Blockchain tracing, simply copy any of the [confirmed addresses from the hack]( that started moving last month and paste them into an explorer. I find the [bitinfocharts explorer]( to work well for this, although it lacks some details (such as identifying named outputs like exchanges), but any explorer should work to trace the path of these coins. Once you paste the address in, just start following the outputs forward. In some cases the criminal has been cleaving off portions of each group at some addresses (later recombined with the rest), in which case I followed the larger group. I tried maybe ten groups of 4 btc from the hack, and ALL of them ended up in address 14We1bbHqPhT1iFrJAoEw772GraB8XKN9D after 12-15 in/out shuffles. I think that there is at least one more address being used to accumulate the coins after the initial shuffle. 
u/fmlnoidea420 identified the wallet that the aforementioned accumulator address was associated with, and was able to see on a different explorer than I was using that one of the outputs was in [fact 10.9 BTC to OKcoin.]( Wallet Explorer seems to only list confirmed transactions, however. This morning I was trying the BTC.com explorer to poke around and saw that there is another [20 BTC from the Bitfinex Hack accumulator wallet awaiting confirmation at OKcoin](
I have not checked to see if any coins other than the 876/120,000 Bitfinex hack coins that began moving last month are on the move. 876 of BTC being dumped into the market = &gt;$1,000,000 of value taken forom the Bitcoin Market and put into the pocket of the hacker(s). What will wiping $130,000,000 worth of Buy Orders off of the books do? Something to consider during this price spike euphoria, gentlemen.

If there were ever any large adoption of Bitcoin as a unit of retail sales, the continuous downward pressure of retailers dumping Bitcoin they bring in every day would destroy the whole idea of it being a store of value.

There are people a lot better versed in the nuts and bolts of the Bitcoin Code who can answer exactly how the issue of prohibited material embedded on the blockchain can be fixed better than myself. I have read that the ability to embed information was increased at one point, so it can certainly be limited. I think. Someone else will know the answer to this for sure.


I don't think it would be a "private blockchain", just a new one. Users, exchanges, nodes, and miners, will choose to follow the new blockchain or the original one.If all follow the revised blockchain, there will remain one Bitcoin. If some choose to not follow the revised one, there will be two Bitcoins. If you are concerned about a small group of people having control over Bitcoin you are seriously lost, because it has been that way for a long time. The entire block debate centered around waiting for approval from the miners says that with a giant blaring bullhorn.

I disagree completely with your bank account analogy, by the way. Accessing a bank account requires proof of identity, and what you are accessing can be physically taken with you, if you so choose. Accessing Bitcoins only requires proof of access, which is comprised of alphanumeric codes which can be stored in a variety of ways, and the Bitcoin stays on the BLockchain which is the only place it exists.

If a country or court within a country deem something illegal, then it is.

I never said buying Fentanyl with Bitcoin was "worse than buying with Cash".  The Fentanyl products people are buying on the street with Cash are being imported with Bitcoin.

I think the CP you are referring to was just links. I don't know if they were valid to begin with, but they were quickly defunct (so people say), so the theory was that this was not an issue. I do not know exactly how the laws read, so the theory on the links may or may not be correct. Posting actual CP images on the blockchain is a different matter entirely, and to my knowledge no CP creep has done this. To be clear: I am not in any way advocating something despicable and universally destructive like putting CP images on the Bitcoin Blockchain. Seriously.

China: Tell the Truth About Tiananmen on Anniversary
Repression of Rights at Post-1989 Peak Under President Xi
(New York) – The Chinese government should cease its denial about the state’s role in the massacre of unarmed pro-democracy protesters and citizens around June 4, 1989, and acknowledge the government’s responsibility for the killings, detentions, and persecution associated with suppression of the protests, Human Rights Watch said today.
Tiananmen Square, Beijing in June 1989. 
Beijing should demonstrate that commitment by immediately ceasing its detention and harassment of individuals marking the occasion, meeting with survivors and their family members, and releasing Yu Shiwen, an activist held since July 2014 for commemorating the massacre.
“Chinese authorities owe a debt of justice and accountability to survivors of the massacre and their family members,” said Sophie Richardson, China director. “Political repression since 1989 has not eliminated yearnings for basic freedoms and an accountable government – instead it has only compounded the Party’s lack of legitimacy.”
As in previous years, authorities have been on high alert ahead of the anniversary to preempt commemorations of the massacre:
In Chengdu on May 28, 2016, authorities detained Fu Hailu on subversion charges; he is suspected of posting on social media images of liquor bottles with labels related to the crackdown.
At least four others – poet Ma Qing in Chengdu, and activists Xu Caihong, Zhao Changqing, and Zhang Baocheng in Beijing – are believed to be in police custody for commemorating the occasion, according to the nongovernmental organization Chinese Human Rights Defenders.
Authorities have also put under house arrest or restricted the movement of a number of activists, including Ding Zilin, a founding member of the Tiananmen Mothers, and retired Shandong professor Sun Wenguang.
Prominent journalist Gao Yu, who in November 2015 was released from prison on medical parole to serve out her five year sentence at home, and former top official Bao Tong, who remains under effective house arrest, have been required to leave Beijing for enforced “vacations.”
Since 1989, the Chinese government has kept tight control over basic human rights – particularly freedoms of expression, assembly, and association, and the right to political participation – despite its obligations under domestic and international human rights law. Intolerance toward dissent, however, has reached a new peak since President Xi Jinping came to power in March 2013. The government has drafted or promulgated new state security laws that put in place more restrictive controls over civil society; further curtailed expression on the Internet and media; detained and imprisoned hundreds of activists in successive waves of arrests; targeted for prosecution public opinion leaders and liberal thinkers; and aggressively promoted the “correct ideology” of Party supremacy.
While the last individual known to be imprisoned for his involvement in the 1989 protests will be released in October 2016, many who were involved in the demonstrations and who continued their activism after their release have been re-incarcerated. Yu Shiwen, who spent 18 months in prison for his 1989 work organizing pro-democracy efforts in Guangzhou, has been detained since 2014 for commemorating the massacre that year. Other veteran activists, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo, Sichuan activists Liu Xianbin and Chen Wei, and Guangdong activist Guo Feixiong are either serving long prison sentences or have been detained on political charges.
Chinese authorities owe a debt of justice and accountability to survivors of the massacre and their family members. 
Authorities have also prevented discussions about the massacre by blocking organizers of, or participants in, the 1989 protests from returning from other countries where they sought refuge in the aftermath of the massacre. Former student leaders Wuer Kaixi and Xiong Yan, for example, have been unable to re-enter China. Their repeated attempts to return in 2013 and 2014 were rejected by Hong Kong authorities.
The Chinese government’s continued denial of the massacre of protesters and hostility toward peaceful political participation contrast sharply with developments elsewhere. In her May 2016 inaugural address, Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan’s new president, vowed to “face the past” by setting up a new Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate “mistakes” of “the era” – which likely refers to the period of political repression known as the White Terror. After five decades of military dictatorship, Burma has begun a transition to electoral democracy.
Background: Bloodshed in 1989
The Tiananmen massacre was precipitated by the peaceful gatherings of students, workers, and others in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square and other cities in April 1989 calling for freedom of expression, accountability, and an end to corruption. The government responded to the intensifying protests in late May 1989 by declaring martial law.
On June 3 and 4, the military opened fire and killed untold numbers of peaceful protesters and bystanders. In Beijing, some citizens attacked army convoys and burned vehicles in response to the military’s violence. Following the killings, the government implemented a national crackdown and arrested thousands of people for “counter-revolution” and other criminal charges, including disrupting social order and arson.
The government has never accepted responsibility for the massacre or held any perpetrators legally accountable for the killings. It has refused to conduct an investigation into the events or release data on those who were killed, injured, disappeared, or imprisoned. The nongovernmental organization Tiananmen Mothers, consisting mostly of family members of those killed, has established the details of 202 people who were killed during the suppression of the movement in Beijing and other cities. Twenty-seven years on, many members of the Tiananmen Mothers are ailing and some have died without seeing justice or knowing precisely what has happened to their family members.
Human Rights Watch called on the Chinese government to use the opportunity of the 27th anniversary of June 4, 1989, to reverse its current position on the event. Specifically, it should:
Respect the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly and cease the harassment and arbitrary detention of individuals who challenge the official account of June 4;
Meet with and apologize to members of the Tiananmen Mothers;
Permit an independent public inquiry into June 4, and promptly release its findings and conclusions to the public;
Allow the unimpeded return of Chinese citizens exiled due to their connections to the events of 1989; and
Investigate all government and military officials who planned or ordered the unlawful use of lethal force against peaceful demonstrators, and publish the names of all those who died.
“Instead of advancing, China has stagnated, and even regressed, in terms of political reforms since 1989,” Richardson said. “Beijing can only move forward by facing up to its painful past, as others have had the confidence to do, and as people across China clearly want.”
This is a clear victory for Freedom of Speech and Human Rights for sure, and is proof of the concept of the Bitcoin Blockchain being a useful tool to fight governmental tyranny. What response this will induce from the Chinese Government is now the question.

You are confusing whether something can be stopped with whether it can be declared illegal. I am certain that there is a line where the Bitcoin Blockchain can be declared illegal to possess and/or distribute, and that governments would take whatever action they deem necessary to deal with the issue. Child Porn being distributed via the Bitcoin Blockchain is the obvious line that any rational person can grasp as being something that pretty much every government in the world would take action on. Saying that governments are powerless to deal with the Bitcoin Blockchain if they see fit is absolute and total naivety in the extreme.

@_date: 2017-03-01 13:19:58
876 Bitcoins from the Bitfinex heist are currently being laundered and sold. I suspect that the thieves understand that there is a limit to how many they can launder at a time (Mixing clogs blocks), and this was a test to see how fast they can move them to exchanges and of course, whether Bitcoiners would notice or care that they are doing so. You obviously do not care that these thieves are clowning Bicoiners for $130,000,000 , so march over to the nearest exchange and give them some money.

@_date: 2017-03-10 22:38:23
Nothing stopped.Just a pause. They are still laundering money. [Here is the address your "Blue Bouncing Ball" is from, 15tYFmUV6wG4e1Gbi1buxBM9zSQzcWSkiK]( If you scroll to the line of block 456544, and then click directly on the ~92BTC transaction amount (in red) the tree of inputs created to obfuscate the origin of these coins can be seen. This shows how data heavy this mixing method is. Every time they bounce it (with a utx), they are also shaving some off and sending it to accumulator addresses. [Here is a picture]( showing how they are creating a transaction made up of dozens or hundreds of tiny pieces- one added every 5 seconds or so,  which then ends up in accumulator addresses. I Included Blue dots which = the Blue Balls for those of you not grasping this. The red dots are the shavings that are sent to accumulator addresses each time the "ball bounces", creating outputs with crazy amounts of tiny inputs. These mega-input transaction accumulators then are emptied out after receiving a few inputs- heading for what I think is another round of mixing. Whoever is laundering these coins is doing a much better job than usual laundering, which of course = more block space used per Bitcoin "cleansed".

@_date: 2017-03-19 21:37:16
No, I am proposing using freedom of speech enabled by the Bitcoin Blockchain to combat tyranny. Tyranny by the Chinese government who have no regard for the will or lives of the Chinese people, and the tyranny of the Chinese Bitcoin Miners who have no regard for the will or well being of the Bitcoin user base.
Here is [some of what the Chinese government wishes to hide]( from it's citizens. Warning: What you will see on that blog regarding the brutality displayed by the Chinese government against student protestors in Tiananmen  Square on June 4, 1989 is extremely shocking. Students run over by tanks and literally ground into road pizza. It is easy to see why a government would want to conceal these horrendous crimes it committed against it's people.

@_date: 2017-03-12 15:09:51


Incorrect. You can't illegally order large quantities of Fentanyl online with cash , this is simply a fact. This is why Bitcoin is used. It is one of the few actual use cases for Bitcoin. 
 If you are aware of how to use dollars to make DNM Drug purchases without getting caught, I think you should share this information, as it would take some of the criminality off of Bitcoin use.
Edit to add: I love your assertion that pointing out an actual valid Merchant use case for Bitcoin makes me a "troll" HIlarious.
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:54:30


Duh? Again: This is why legitimate businesses use the legal currency system, and Criminals prefer Bitcoin. Tumblebit promises to vastly improve Bitcoin as a Crime Tool.  
Criminal activity enabled by Bitcoin is a major portion of it's use. Quite possibly the number one use. Saying that some neckbeards also buy coffee with Bitcoin or whatever "legitimate use" case you want to list does not change this.

Fascinating answer, really. Would you care to explain why a father would not be angry upon learning that the Fentanyl that killed his child was put in her hand via Bitcoin? I have been around the block a few times, and I happen to know exactly how people react upon finding out that drugs killed a loved one. Add to that finding out that it was ordered with a click of the mouse with Bitcoin and I am certain they would put the primary blame on Bitcoin. 
But please, enlighten us all as to why the opposite of reality is now fact.
@_date: 2017-02-19 21:20:04


That is a fascinating supposition. How do you know this to be fact? I see no attempt to even try to throw out some rational explanation for such a wild theory. Just baseless speculation without a shred of corroborating evidence. 


I never even mentioned inflation. I never mentioned taxes either. What I had asked was for an explanation of how Bitcoin does NOT serve the Powers That Be in their quest for a Cashless Society, and you did not even try to address it, but rather just tossed out a couple of straw man arguments and pretended to have actually answered the question, which you did not.
Again: Is there really no one here that can stick up for Bitcoin as being a weapon of liberation against the entrenched economic power system and explain how Bitcoin is actually NOT exactly what those in power want and need for a variety of purposes? 
 Edit to add: Also, how is the extreme inflationary model of Bitcoin now suddenly "Non-Inflationary"? Please explain how it is not possible to inflate Bitcoin even further after the currently programmed inflation ends. I happen to know that Bitcoin and Fiat currency can both be inflated by those in control of the respective systems. Please feel free to prove to me that Bitcoin code can not be changed as this entire forum debates which changes currently on the table should be implemented.

As fascinating as your suggestion about calling the Police on the Academics who are on the Government Payroll who developed Tumblebit to assist Criminals in using Bitcoin to facilitate their crimes, I think I have thought of something better. I am going to fire off some emails to every anti-drug group I can dig up and let them know about how their tax dollars are being used to help criminals get deadly drugs into the hands of their children, and let those criminals get away with it. Large, well funded groups of pissed off mothers of children killed by drugs will likely have something to say about this.
@_date: 2017-03-12 22:38:18
Incorrect, "using Bitcoin properly" does not protect you from those stealing Capital from the Bitcoin system and thus reducing the overall value of all coins. The coins from the MtGox and Bitfinex heists alone are enough to completely wipe the Buy Bids off of every exchange, repeatedly, for a long period of time. That is not even getting into what would happen when the vast mega-stashes of coins being held by early adopters are dumped. A financial system that can be clowned repeatedly by a handful of players is the opposite of security, sorry to burst your bubble.

Correct Answer: This is Bitcoin Laundering in action. Thus far, [around 20,000 Bitcoins have been washed here since December 15.](
How can people not understand that all of the massive amounts of laundering(mixing) such as this operation is what is clogging blocks?

I have presented compelling and 100% verified large scale use cases for this new Tumblebit System which will all benefit from what it promises to deliver. All of the ones I could think of happened to be completely Criminal uses of Bitcoin. If you know of a legitimate use case that will benefit from Tumblebit, I think you should present it and quit wasting verbiage reciting the "Bitcoin isn't only for Criminals" spiel. I have heard that one before, seriously.
Oh," disgusting Child Porn creeps, Narcotics pushers, Ransomware Extortionists, Tax Evaders, Terrorists, Kidnappers, Hitmen" should also include Money Laundering, which includes laundering Bitcoins stolen from exchanges and such. I am sure the Bitfinex hackers and all of the other Bitcoin thieves will be delighted that they can move those 120,000 Bitcoins onto exchanges to sell back to the people they stole them from without [people like me doggedly tracking their criminal asses]( 
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:22:46
OK, I will for now assume that you are telling the truth (I have had PMs from people claiming to have uploaded the text message and the picture). If I may ask, what was your motivation for doing so? Was it to try to force a change in the Bitcoin Mining Centralization issue? A political statement? Art? All of the above? Something else entirely?

Interesting viewpoint, however, you are completely missing the fact that those Chinese currently bypassing the Great Firewall are officially Criminals, whether they are currently being prosecuted or not. And, of course, you are also missing the fact that the Chinese Miners operate nodes INSIDE of the Great Firewall of China. Big difference. Putting material that the Chinese Government has declared illegal on the Bitcoin Blockchain would officially make it illegal material to possess and distribute within China, which is precisely what any nodes used by miners and others would be.

I actually have, but since you obviously did not grasp it earlier, I will repeat this fact: Bitcoin is used to purchase large quantities of Fentanyl. This is then made into [fake pharma pills for kids]( or [mixed with heroin which murders junkies]( take your pick, it is both. They both end up just as dead, and the poison that killed them was likely imported with Bitcoin.

I just made a post [here]( that fleshes out some of my thoughts about the state of Freedom and people's perception of what is going on regarding Bitcoin and criminal activities being conducted with it, the Internet in general, Privacy, and the way the world actually works, so I decided to share it here, Quote:
 I am appalled at the mixture of ignorance and hypocrisy, as well as the scumbag criminals. If you are against something that makes it easier for criminals to sell lethal narcotics to any geeky kid who can click a mouse, they try to paint you as if you are some sort of Ant-Freedom Pro-Tyranny fascist, when I can assure you that is the opposite of what I am. The ignorance about what they are accomplishing by "sticking it to the man" by using Bitcoin in general, and using it to engage in illegal things, in particular, is that they think this is somehow going to bring about a change in society in the favor of increased Liberty, and this is the opposite of how it really works.
If I were the Man Behind the Curtain pulling the levers in the US, and I had as part of my agenda say, to make the Internet into a government controlled, highly censored, propaganda mouthpiece that only allows "correct thinking" to be presented, how would I do it? (First I would create the internet, but that is a discussion in itself) Hmmm, can't just go smashing their precious "Information Freedom" with an iron fist and simply decreeing it, that would make the plebs upset and cause serious problems for me. Would probably completely backfire.
No, what I would do is get the plebs to not just agree to my plan, but Demand it. Allowing out of control amounts of sheer criminality to pervade the "Free internet" would be my choice of achieving my goals, as a tyrant. If something like Bitcoin did not exist to implement this wave of criminality, I would create it. As the level of criminality grew, I would now and then strike at high profile criminals using the internet and Bitcoin to do things like murder tens of thousands of people with Fentanyl, thus paying lip service to my position as Protector of Plebs, and building up mass awareness of the growing shitball of criminality creeping into every corner of the country and murdering their children and friends via the internet and Bitcoin.
As anger grew and answers to this problem were sought, I would respond by saying "We are doing everything we can, but, shucks, we are Constitutionally restricted from dealing with this matter effectively". Then, let the kettle boil until some high profile catastrophic events occurred which would take over the news cycle and grip the nation. A decent sized group of nice white suburbanite kids dropping dead at their prom from some bad fake pills made with Fentanyl purchased with Bitcoin by the geeky kid with mad DarkNet haxxor skills to impress his friends would fill the bill.
At that point, you would have the people marching in the streets demanding that you toss any archaic Constitutional protections out the fucking window and crack down on the source of the problem. "Ohh, that silly Freedom idea is too much for you ignorant plebs? And you want to give me total and absolute control over what information you can receive? , Well, it is a big job, but with the proper funding we can git'r done" Mission Accomplished
Oh, and at the same time I were enacting the plan to crack down on Information Freedom, I would also be bolstering the belief of the plebs in the solidity and sanctity of the criminal banking system I use to run society and enrich my minions by showing them how private currencies are even worse. And employ Military hardware on the streets of America for an all out War on Drugs? Well, if you plebs insist. But we will have to raise Taxes again to fund it... Yuk, Yuk.

Right, Bitcoin is simply a tool which helps criminals commit crimes and get away with it- at least for a while. Also, many of these crimes being facilitated with Bitcoin are simply not practical on a large scale without Bitcoin- such as Ransomware and Child Porn sales.
@_date: 2017-03-12 22:17:27
I am well aware of how Bitcoin works, but thank you for sharing your vast knowledge on the matter. The fact is that most Bitcoin users use exchanges. Also, you can not seem to comprehend that each theft removes capital from the Bitcoin system, which makes your stash worth that much less. In the case of the 120,000 Bitcoin from the Bitfinex heist, it is taking ~$140,000,000 from the system and putting it in the pockets of the criminals. 876/120,000 have already been laundered and moved to exchanges and such, so now with Tumblebit , they can skip that long block clogging laundering process and just move them directly to exchanges to sell them back to the people who they were stolen from, along with other fresh "Bitcoin investors". 
By the way: [During my tracing of the Bitfinex heist coins being laundered right now]( I managed to make a pretty solid connection to someone who bought a large block of them. The posters here in this forum would LOVE to know where this points, trust me on this. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 20:18:51
I do not know how the Chinese miners will deal with this issue if forced by the CCP for them to do so. A rollback seems like the most likely solution. Jihan Wu (Bitmain) has just recently implied that he personally can conduct a 51% attack, which is essentially what a blockchain rollback to remove transactions would be. If and when that occurs, there would be a moment of decision where people would have to choose the new cleansed blockchain or the original one. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:44:10


That is not my intent. You can find plenty of regular posters on this very sub who do want to do exactly that, though.


It was designed to be used as a medium for the storage and distribution of ideas as well as storing the information about units of exchange of value (Bitcoins). To stop it being used for exactly what Satoshi envisioned it should be used for would be a fundamental change in what Bitcoin is.

By all means, please proceed.

The fable of mass adoption by merchants, that is a good one.

Bitcoin is relevant because we are talking about crimes that are either only possible using it, or makes them easier to implement on a mass scale- and get away with it.


Ahh, the lovely odor of "Harm Reduction". As someone who was once one of those crazy kids , I can say with 100% certainty that I am glad that myself and the cats I ran with back in the day did not have easy access to a cornucopia of deadly narcotics via Bitcoin and a few clicks of the mouse. You want to pretend that some geek behind a keyboard buying deadly narcotics to impress his friends means that if he could not do that with a mouse in his suburban bedroom then he would be walking the streets of the Ghetto buying Heroin off of scary street dealers- and that these street wise criminals would be stupid enough actually sell to him. Get real. It simply is not the case. 
Enabling children to purchase deadly narcotics with a mouse is completely and horribly fucked up and criminal, and defending it makes you the same.

I researched the information listed in this Blockchain message, and it appears to be grounded in fact- as far as I can tell.

What happens if derogatory/libelous accusations are embedded in the Blockchain? If a court rules that some accusations embedded on the Bitcoin Blockchain are libelous, then what? Does posting something on the Blockchain really make it outside the reach of Courts? What if false accusations of serious crimes like murder, etc, are placed upon someone via the Blockchain? Does that person have the right to seek a court order to have them removed? There are a lot of unanswered questions regarding the possibilities regarding information stored and distributed with the Bitcoin Blockchain.

They control the coin code, but they rely on the next wave of monetary input from adopters for their profit. Forking extra rewards into the code at this point would drive away their source of income, YOU, the folks who seem to honestly believe that there is a 21 Million Bitcoin Limit and pour money into bitcoin. When they have no other option, they will then try it, as they have nothing to lose at that point.

If what you are saying was true there would be no block size debate. The fact is that both teams are waiting for the miners who have all of the decision making power to choose one or the other. It is clear that they currently see no need to implement either one.

It is clear that you do not understand what you are talking about. The SW/BU "debate" illustrates what I am pointing out very clearly. Two proposed changes are waiting for the MINERS to adopt one or the other. Thus far they have voted for "None of the above". It is THEY who will decide if and when any change to block size is implemented, regardless of what everyone else wants to pretend.  This is simply a fact that random ad hominem insults and foot stamping is not going to change.
@_date: 2017-01-26 16:06:36
The miners are aware that the increased block size limit of SW isn't enough to meet the demands of the Mixers that are flooding the blocks with tiny transactions, so they don't feel compelled to implement a risky and ineffective Band Aid that will need to be replaced the day after it is put on.

If by some odd chance they actually don't have 51% already, all they would need is a single ally. And that's today. When the inescapable negative mining return crisis approaches, the minor miners will drop away very quickly, and they will undoubtedly have complete dominance over the network to implement any changes they want to try.

Yet here all the lemmings sit and squabble about when the miners will adopt block size solution A or B. The miners don't care what a handful of rubes on a couple of forums think. If one of the solutions suits them if and when they think it is necessary they *might* choose one of these free options prepared for them. If not, they will produce their own. As far as the "big risk to their income", you failed to comprehend what I wrote. When the miners face negative returns, they have to do something or go bankrupt. It is that simple. I happen to know that a Billion dollar corporation will do something. They will diversify into other fields as this approaches, and then as it gets close they will divest themselves of all coins they hold, then implement a fork to restore their profit margin. If it fails they simply walk away from the wreckage and focus on the other income streams they set in place as the crisis approached. If you think that Bitmain did not already have a contingency plan in place at the recent halving with a similar fork solution already prepared you do not understand how corporations function.

 I never said larger blocks had anything to do with miner profit, so your comment is completely non sequitur. The fact is miners don't fucking care about block size, as evidenced by them taking no action on the matter. All they care about is PROFIT.

If that changes, and they think the matter needs to be addressed THEN they will take action.

If that were true you would be doing what I am doing instead of trying to put band-aids on your precious Magic Bean Stalk which is enabling this mass wave of death to roll across America, creeping into every backwoods corner where parents think their children are safe from the scurge of narcotics.
As far as losing Freedoms as a result of what Bitcoin enables, I have no doubt that is going to happen. The idea that Bitcoin is going to enable increased Freedom in the face of increasing Tyranny is absurd. I have even conjectured that creating a Problem to which the public Reaction will be to demand a crackdown on Privacy and the Internet (The Solution that is desired by the Powers That Be) is one of the true purposes of why Bitcoin was created.

I'm one of those conservative Christians who has never done drugs, hardly ever drunk any alcohol, and believes the whole "war on drugs" is a pathetic failure.
A single night out with me and the guys I ran with back in the day would likely wisen you up a bit about why making hardcore narcotics easily available to *anyone* is a bad idea.

Anyone that thinks a deadly poison like Fentanyl should be legal to openly distribute is either: A. Criminally insane, or B: Mentally incapable of understanding that there are bad things.

I hear they are working on adding OneCoin mining as well....

LOL, I have gone round and round trying to explain to people here on r/bitcoin that Tor is a government created and funded tool, and most simply will not believe it. FYI: Anyone who uses Tor is now subject to the FBI's blanket warrant, and they can actually trace anybody they want. It's basically a honeypot. I am also well aware that there are bad players  in the US government, but this does not change the fact that they make the rules here.

You're in luck, they sell them is batches of five for $19,000 per, including a fancy glass rack like a stereo cabinet.

Well, look what popped up today: 
These Zurich based researchers say that it is a simple matter for an ISP to attack the Bitcoin network and cause it to fork, effectively wrecking Bitcoin- and get this- WITHOUT BREAKING THE ENCRYPTION! Huh, just like I said was possible, imagine that. Do you think states have the power to order ISPs to conform to court orders? I happen to know for sure that they do, as it happens all the time.

Sorry, fail. Bitcoin is NOT a "true free market" at all. It is controlled by a handful of people who only have their own personal interests in mind.

This is a myth. Simply declaring Bitcoin illegal would stop the vast majority of users overnight, and this is going to happen. To shut Bitcoin down completely would likely require a crackdown on Privacy and the Internet. In case you are not aware, The Powers That Be REALLY want to do this, and some mass murder event enabled by Bitcoin would be just the thing they need to do so. 


You are naive, and your rationalizations of Bitcoin making it simple for any kid in America to buy shit like this are absurd.
 Edit: Well, well, well. What do we have here on this mornings Bitcoin Crime news? 
You had better call the Belgian Minister of Justice and let him know he can't do his job. After that you might want to start calling US officials to let them know they are powerless as well. Perhaps you should start with Florida's Attorney General Bondi, who was recently appointed to Trump's Opioid and Drug Abuse Commission. She seems to make the same connection between Bitcoin and Fentanyl that I do, so you had better call her up and let her know she is completely wrong, and of course powerless even if she is right.

On r/Bitcoin? Hilarious. Oh, man, my sides. Whoooh, that's a good one... Got any others? I am always up for a good laugh.
@_date: 2017-04-14 20:01:31


I'll take a guess as to what you are referring to: A crackdown on privacy and the free flow of information via the Internet because Bitcoin is shitting in the Freedom Pool? Amiright? 
@_date: 2017-04-15 06:08:00
Wrong. Hardcore drugs were hard to get when I was a pup, and even so the toll was heavy. If you honestly think that Bitcoin enabling kids to buy deadly drugs with ease is OK, I reply:
"May the flatulent vulture of your innate hypocrisy come home to roost in your tree and shit on your fucking head".

But they are being touted by no other than Crypto Coins News, a rock solid [pillar of integrity in the Bitcoinosphere.](
@_date: 2017-04-23 20:22:51
So, the founder of the preferred super secure Bitcoin hardware wallet, Trezor, gets the 3 month old news that fake Trezors with Trojans loaded on them are being given away to people at Bitcoin events from an r/Buttcoin poster who came over here into hostile territory and filled you in....
Surely this will get me a promotion and a fat raise. Maybe even a corner office in the ButtCoinagon. Darest I dream of being awarded the coveted [Chocolate Donut with Bacon medal]( for actions above and beyond the call of duty?
@_date: 2017-04-15 20:11:05


It's the latter.


You do not understand anything at all. I am not against Bitcoin, I am against it being openly promoted as a vehicle for criminal activities.


Bullshit. Bitcoin is designed to enable crime, and the people running things are openly endorsing these criminal activities and trying to make Bitcoin better for criminals, instead of trying to clean it up and make it legitimate. This is what the whole block issue is about, the blocks are clogged because of the massive amounts of "mixing" to cleanse coins which have a criminal trail, which is most of them in existence. 
Here is a recent discussion I had here about Tor: 
I presented facts and was accused of being a "conspiracy theorist" for simply speaking the truth about what Tor is.
@_date: 2017-04-14 23:41:15
Incorrect. Drugs are a problem, and making it easy for any kid to get his hands on lethal narcotics is definitely a problem.
@_date: 2017-04-15 14:54:31
Bitcoin enables any kid in America to easily obtain deadly narcotics, including insanely deadly shit like Carfentanil. Making it literally child's play to obtain poisons that could easily kill an entire school full of children is wrong, and your lame attempts at rationalizing this will not change this fact.

The Heroin/Fentanyl that killed William Doerhoff , the subject of this FOX piece, was purchased with Bitcoin. 




While my methods may be crude, they are in fact effective, regardless of what you want to believe.


No, it isn't. By the way, I am only gruff with people when posting in this shithole full of toxic amoral fucks like you. 
Also: All of you assholes selling deadly narcotics for Bitcoin are now officially looking at potentially being charged with murder when someone dies from the poison you sell them. There isn't any statute of limitations for murder, and there is a permanent record of the transactions, so you can be identified and directly linked to deaths and charged with murder at any time in the future. This of course includes whoever sold Will Doerhoff the shit that killed him.

Is that supposed to be clever? Fail. 
@_date: 2017-04-15 16:19:50
It is quite possible that Bitcoin was created, and let get completely out of control, enabling ridiculous amounts of sheer criminality to ensue, for the precise reason of creating a Problem for which the masses will React and Demand a Solution(A crackdown on Privacy and Internet freedom), which is exactly what the Powers That Be want. If The Powers That Be did not create Bitcoin, they must be laughing until they piss their fucking pants that someone did it for them.

Wut? Did you figure out that you have no idea what you are talking about and are running away?

A downvote and no reply? Care to explain why you think making it literally child's play for any kid in Amercia to get any fucking drug imaginable, up to quantities that could easily be used for mass murder/terrorism, is not absurd and completely fucking criminal??

Very good. You have described the actions taken by the user of the  mixer. They accept your dirty coins and give you ones that have been cleansed, and of course charge you a fee. 
Now explain what the mixer does to make the dirty coins you gave them lose their dirtiness so they can then be spent without fear of them being attached to something undesirable and thus cleansed so they can be given to the next customer. 
Hint: It involves shuffling the coins around to obfuscate the trail.
