Exactly. The hubris is astounding, stood on their crumbling hill and still calling everything else shitcoins. Perhaps if dev and pundits weren't so smug on their laurels and sorted their scaling issues out things would be different. But they ain't. Next up a big price fall for btc

Well hodl'd. One thing to come out of all this is that BCH is definitely the new BTC short. Just take a look at the inverse correlations. Expect it to make another run when bitcoin takes a big dump prior to futures trading starting in a few weeks. Any hedge fund manager is going to take one look at an asset with a monthly RSI of 91 and short the bollocks off it.

It's gonna be so cool if it comes out Elon is Satoshi. Think about it...A coder, smart enough to come up with such a big idea in the first place, a guy who thinks about what is best for humanity, famous for disruptive business models, already did internet money with paypal, Elon kinda fits the bill... Plus you know, a good reason for Satoshi to be anonymous is bitcoin might not have had the same success with a famous face behind it. Elon is gonna climb on that big fucking rocket to Mars and just before they close the doors say oh by the way, I'm Satoshi Nakamoto

No but perhaps if It was an Elon Musk project it would be seen that way

Point taken but this is a guy who started a tunneling/ urban transportation company as a side project

Well it has to be someone...and Whoever Satoshi is he sure doesn't need the money, hasn't touched his wallet has he/she/they

I see bitcoin being like gold as a store of value and not going away soon but agree it's not the blockchain tech that will change the mainstream financial system. Which is why I am all in XRP bitches

I don't even hold bitcoin but am watching my xrp sink with you guys. Let ppl run for the exits, that's all this is. Buy more if you can, average down. Once the uncertainty has lifted, business as usual.
