He doesn't have to do shit. If you can't handle a world with both negative and positive news, then that's your problem. I'd say posting senseless "HODL" statements is way more dangerous as a financial advice than this link here.

OMG, have we missed something really important here? Theres not enough monies for the people! Thats what has been wrong all along!
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:51:22
wrong. if you think this is about technology, vision, usefulness or whatever the other fuck fundamental thing, then unfortunately its you who is in the wrong place. this has been pure speculation for a while now, lets be honest here.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:49:12
ah I see you have invented better tools than the people who have done it for a century. but instead of sharing those, why not post a cryptic "Thats something for you to think about", because thats even MORE cooler!
@_date: 2018-01-31 10:46:54
Excellent analysis. This is good for bitcoin. The lower it goes, the higher the price will be. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:44:20
Desperately wanting? I don't think BTC price changes my life too much either way, but it's true I wouldnt mind buying a whole bitcoin if the price drops considerably. But you.. do sound desperate. Bad trade today? Maybe don't put in more than you can afford to lose?
But the bottom line is that yes, I do think bitcoin is way overpriced at this time, considering it's current adoption rate, use cases and technology.
And the fact that a lot of people here are so much affected by bitcoin's price shows there's still too much speculation and treasure hunters left. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:05:54
You are mostly correct I guess. But I'm wondering how much of this congestion is artificial? Like, seeing the bots trading on exchanges, does this mean every transaction a bot does congests the network even more? Did Satoshi foresee this in his design?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:00:42
well said, cant agree with you more.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:20:45
In addition to the tech, Bitcoin is shaped by market forces. At this time, the speculation is at it's highest; as OP mentioned, no-one foresaw this much "adoption" (quotes intentional). However, market tends to sort itself out, and transaction fees are designed to take this into consideration. When the price eventually corrects (as it is doing now), it will hopefully shake out parties that are not really interested in using bitcoin for its intended purpose; transactions go down and we stabilize at a new, healthier price/popularity/transaction amount level.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:22:50
this is no place for your sober thoughts and wise caution! this is a place where only rise is tolerated! :)
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:49:43
completely disagree. big part of the bitcoin hype today is the fact that just ONE bitcoin costs 18000 USD.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:04:02
you do realise you can be right 10 times with this, but eventually you will be wrong and then you still lose everything? you can win 100% many times, lose 100% only once.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:56:53
What a meaningless post this is.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:58:30
exactly my thoughts. its actually super easy to sell and sit one out, you are not actually losing anything. you are just stable.
but i guess if some expects to gain 50% every month, then thats a different play. greedy, but might work.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:43:07
Very emotional post, but kinda pointless really. You, me, and your dog know that most people are innit just for the speculation, quick buck. Thats why they watch the charts. And thats why if it dips hard, there's gonna be a lot of sellers.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:34:37
Buying other coin next to Bitcoin is NOT diversifying. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:46:21
the answer is that nobody knows. many people are probably betting on the weekend futures market opening and that being a positive thing, but really, it could go any which way. we can for sure say that the price today is fueled by speculation and get rich mentality, but how long until it crashes.. nobody knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:48:24
how about not buying at all? have you considered that an option? or are you a psychic and can guarantee that the price actually goes up at all?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:37:45
you're welcome :) well done  deep into green then.
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:08:46
apparently you can see into the future? what will the price be then, by your estimation?
i'd say that guy was correct, only thing is we dont know if it will crash "soon" or go up multiple times before coming down some.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:15:30
waiting to see what happens tonight. why risk it? they are already up 1000%, they can afford to miss out on a 30% gain.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:43:38
Excellent! Although I would have liked to hear more about the actual use cases and true value of Bitcoin. What forms of usefulness can we predict today for it? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:21:19


you must be a psychic?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:02:18
sounds like you are getting a bit desperate. why care about others so much? better see that your own money is well managed.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:12:11
if thats the case.. then the bad news is we still got 24-36 hours to go, and thats quite the drop. I managed to sell mine  , lets see if i cry or laugh tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:04:38
Seems to me a lot of us want to sit in FIAT until the CBOE thing starts to show clear signs. So until that time, there will still be sell pressure, while not a lot of buyers risk going out there to buy. Who knows what happens come Monday, but until then, it kinda makes sense the price will drop? And while it does, how much strength does the market really have, to resist dropping too much? Thats the big worry, the market seems pretty thin at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:17:28
so.. thats pumping you describe. people aimlessly buying altcoins to make more profit.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:07:30
You are not missing much. It's probably a group thinking effect, with the underlying sentiment of fear and denial from a lot of people who have not been rich before, now are, and are scared of losing it all again - rightly so.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:09:54
well that statement really has little to do with what is happening with bitcoin these days.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:47:08
this post should be deleted as misleading. doesn't probably need explaining that cryptocurrency is not the same as blockchain.

Why do you think its satire? Most of it is a pretty accurate description of current events, although the part about the future is quite over the top. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:57:13
If you made similar statements there, no wonder you got banned. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:26:17
It's an excellent summary and a good description of the positive future we all do hope for.
Today, me (and most people) still trust the € (or $) more and therefore keep our assets in €. The question is what would it take to change that?
I dont think its the Venezuela scenario for €, because if € goes, the shit that hits the fan is too gigantic and Bitcoin could get seriously hurt too.
So it has to be a positive event instead of a negative, perhaps.
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:50:44
So you are saying that for a financial instrument to rise 30x in a short period of time is NOT actually that easy??
This sub has mostly lost its touch with reality.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:55:44
You don't make any sense. First you compare credit swaps to Bitcoin, therefore saying that bitcoin's future is dark? And then suddenly say that (because of that??) fiat is in trouble? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:49:38
nobody wants to store wealth in something that fluctuates 10% or more daily. the new gold theory is interesting as a concept, but that is not the case at all today. just go look at the price graph for a second. you'd have to be mad to store all your excess reserves in bitcoin right now.
bitcoin's main use case was and still is to be a currency. but that is kinda on hold today for technical reasons. i personally really hope we figure this out, because that still remains the one use case which actually makes sense, long term.
so whats left? speculation. and no matter how long its gonna go up, this is NOT a good future for bitcoin, because by definition speculation holds a danger of a sudden collapse and selloff. many posts here describe that in more detail.
i'd say this price hike has forced bitcoin to really figure out its purpose.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:53:52
If the economy of the western world will continue to be in a good spot like it is today, people will still be looking for a place where to out their spare money for at least some sort of gain, compared to the flat interest rates of conventional markets.
In that scenario, growth like this year would continue for bitcoin.
If general economy goes to shit, bitcoin will be hit harder than more stable conventional assets, losing most of its value. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:12:21
Ok, I understand what you are saying. I guess we disagree about this - the way I see it, real world use cases give bitcoin it's value. And real world cares little for some incremental, obscure tech advantages that other coins might bring. Thing is, if Bitcoin lost its traction in the real world, I'd say the value of 99% altcoins would be absolute zero.
Ofc there could be other scenarios, ie. Bitcoin having a fundamental tech issue that some other coin totally does not have. But the chance of that has really diminished by now. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:56:15
yeah.. between coinbase still not showing my FIAT deposit and any bitcoin movement pretty much frozen, i've been trying to get on the buyboat for two days now without any success. lesson learned: if you want to move quickly, be prepared.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:55:10
I've never understood this. Forgot about what the price is.. But what are these alt coins FOR? I'd argue that at this time, we have exactly one use case - to have a crypto currency based on blockchain. That use case is fulfilled by Bitcoin. What would the use be for rest of them? OK, Eth has its dubious ICO system, but the rest?
I'm genuinely curious, always had this question when somebody talks about "investing into altcoins". 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:59:23
If it's all your money, I'd strongly advise against putting it all in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:07:40
Sure, but each level of growth brings a different set of challenges. Or would you say that 100K is possible without significant increase in adoption and use cases?
Example: bitcoin userbase grows 1000x, which happily also means much more demand and higher price. But let's say that now a large amount of salaries are being paid out in bitcoin. Bypassing taxes. This of course creates inequality, which in turn creates demand for regulations. Regulations take time, Bitcoin price stalls. 
There can be many other examples like this. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:10:32
No savings, but bought 20K$ worth of bitcoin in 2013, when very few believed in bitcoin at all? Sounds fishy. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:58:58
Why would you say something like that? This is not good advice to someone who is all-in, and could cause that person to take huge losses he can't afford. Will you take responsibility then? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:42:25
thats a really stupid answer to a very relevant proposal. instead starting 10 "hodl" threads and 10x as many "we are under attack!" threads per day, it would not actually be a bad idea to invest some of the free money we all got back into the project we supposedly love. put together a fund that supports existing devs or attracts new ones, add some good PR to that.. seems that this, at the very least, is something worth discussing?? 
go through 100 threads in this forum, and you find one that actually proposes or discusses anything useful, and then it gets shouted down. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:20:02
Have to agree with u/MuliBoy here. Holders are creating an artificial scarcity, which might drive up the short term price because of decreased supply and increased demand. But it does next to nothing in terms of adding value to Bitcoin. Whereas actual use cases is the strongest argument Bitcoin has against something like Bcash, which has zero real world traction. 
I understand the holders sentiment in this community, but by definition, holding only is not the correct use of money (currency? Not English native, sorry). 
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:58:46
You are saying this based on what?
The current momentum is good, but getting to 100K is not about "good momentum". It needs an explosion, a couple of paradigm shifts maybe, new fuel to feed this crazy upwards trend. I completely disagree its "nothing", otherwise it would all be done by now. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:39:01
I think the price is a bit inflated now, and 100K would mean mayor changes in the world outside bitcoin - legislation, taxes, markets. Kinda hard to imagine all that happening in a few years, if you really think about it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:32:21
maybe he is not an investor, maybe he is a trader. hence his worry about daily price movements.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:47:51
The usual advice would be to diversify your portfolio based on risk. Bitcoin is a high risk asset.
But anyway, depends on what you are after. Investing? Speculating? What's your time frame? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:05:15
good point. I'd add that today is a good day to show this graph as accurate, but ie. at the beginning of 2017 this would not have been very accurate at all.

terrible advice. don't listen to him and just hold because this subbreddit is obsessed with holding. base your decisions on your own needs and tolerance to losing money.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:33:31
Well, is the bitcoin ready for the real world or not? If Bitcoin really wants to be worth 500000USD someday, there's a ton of tests like this it has to pass. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:06:50
Yeah I hear you. But think about this - if people did sell more, or spend more, and the price would fall, what would that mean for the Bitcoin VALUE? Value as in usefulness, ease of handling, sustainability.
I'd argue that it doesn't hurt value at all. And if the price did fall, then that means the price did not match the actual fundamental value of bitcoin - which indicates a bubble or at least speculative nature.
So. I'd say if the aim is to cling to the current price, or maybe protect one's investment, then group holding kinda works. But speaking long term and big picture, I cannot see how holding is a sustainable strategy. You have to accept normal market rules and circulation at some point, otherwise it's just not healthy and the wider audience would lose their interest.
Or I guess you could make an agreement amongst a limited group of people to hold indefinitely and thus keep the price on an artificial level, but I'm not sure any of us idealist see that as the correct path to fixing the world :) 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:59:37
Thing is, there's a ton of people out there who dont know what the shit to do with their money. Stocks are up for 8 years already, real estate is expensive, savings account interest is too low, too much of the portfolio is already in crowdfunding.. A lot of money out there looking for something to do. Bitcoin? Why not give it a try.. They know nothing about it, just like you said.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:06:04
Well that's the thing. Maybe tomorrow there will be a second Mt Gox and OP here will be worth 100K instead of 1M in a heartbeat. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:58:09
The market knows this, as we can all see. And it is the truth. Now the question is, what level of price will correspond to this truth - same as early 2017? Or higher this time, because there is a ton of new stuff in the crypto space? Or lower this time, because the dissappointment after yet another false start / specualtion is so much higher?
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:49:01
based on this comment alone, seems like BTC still has some dropping to do before the recovery. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 12:33:08
not when there's only whales left. reason for professionals to trade bitcoin is to take the money of the normies. if its too quiet, the professionals will leave too.

@_date: 2018-02-05 14:54:15
Well, you can still do something with it. It is still useful for some people, I guess? But yes, its usefulness is probably not worth 20K USD per bitcoin right now, nor 10K or maybe even 3K.
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:45:50
Actually - you are somewhat right and I did get a bit confused there. 20000 volume has been going on only for a few days if I remember correctly, before that futures volume was truly insignificant. Anyhow, you can check that yourself. There's been quite a lot of talk about it on r/BitcoinMarkets.
Professional traders benefitting is another story completely and totally true - I mean, that's their job? But blaming bitcoin's fall as their fault is simply not true. They might earn from it, they might accelerate a fall or rise here and there, but I don't think they'd  have the power to single handedly bring it down from 20000usd to 6000. That's just market sentiment, and I totally agree with it. Bitcoin has yet to prove itself as something  truly useful and groundbreaking.
Anyhow I'll try to be back with more facts once I have not had a few gin and tonics. Cheers. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:36:43
lol, trying to find someone to blame? BTC costs 10000USD today - thats a lot of money! people are not sure if its actually any more useful than the price reflects. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:26:25
So enlighten us. What is the current use case for Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, that should make me use it instead of, lets say, the euro? Or if not instead of the euro, then beside it, but for actual reasons that would make my life easier/better/cheaper/faster?
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:49:07
Exactly what I meant. And you are most likely wrong again. Check the futures volume, it's insignificant, something like 20000 coins per day at its peak . Hardly a major factor for the price.
20k was a craziness, major FOMO and hype. Now let's see what BTC is actually worth. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:59:31
Well, you are not wrong. So it should not be a problem that the price per bitcoin falls to lets say 1000-3000 USD. I'd personally say that this price level would reflect Bitcoin's current true value much more accurately than whatever the price is right now. But for some reason the price drop is a problem and a tragedy for a lot of folks both here and elsewhere.
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:47:54
and a lot of shorts liquidated at once
@_date: 2018-02-24 12:07:20
the volume and interest we had massed for dec 2017 has not returned, and not sure if it will. the mass hype is usually a one time thing, press does not sell same news twice etc. would be interesting to see the number of active online users on different exchanges - im pretty sure its declining, and much lower than dec 2017. 
but the good news is that the buyers and holders this time are here for more serious reasons. 
i kinda want to make the prediction that BTC tries to find its stable price for a longer period now, and it might just be around 10000$, but then again its BTC and we might see +-50% in just a few months.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:06:24
stockmarket fell after dissappointing corporate results etc. some are suspecting the fall will continue into the new week and could be a sign of the endless climb finally flatting out and turning into a fall.  
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:11:07


No fundamental reason, same as for all this rise past 3-4 months. The price will stabilize when the crowd "feels like" thats the fair price. Which probably means it will fall through reasonable levels at first, because the disappointment needs a cooldown period. Then maybe stabilize at some level that at least kinda reflects the actual usefulness of bitcoin? who knows.  
@_date: 2017-10-06 09:53:50
How can anything increase on its own terms? Or do you mean the quantity, ie. you plan to buy a thousand times more dogecoin? 
@_date: 2018-02-24 12:22:08
who will be the buyers? what would be the reason that will attract lets say twice as much people to buy bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-04-01 17:35:26
you will have plenty of opportunities during 2018 to "buy the dip" or whatever you call it. this is most likely not the bottom, and if you are waiting for parabolic rise again, its probably either years away, or will never happen again for bitcoin. maybe some other coin tho.
