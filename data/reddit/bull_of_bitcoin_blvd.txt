Crypto currencies are not commodities. They are currencies. It’s right in the term. Some are commodity currencies, but most are not, including BTC. 
This is a totally unprecedented situation, market, etc. and to compare it to commodities throughout history would be unwise. 
However I do agree with the notion that people are being idiots with financial speculation. But all of this is speculation. None of us **know** what’s going to happen with the crypto currencies market. 
I can’t do it. I’m diversified. In an untested industry like this I did not put anything more into it than I could afford to lose. But with that being said, it’s the people who are willing to risk everything who walk away with lambos in 3 years, if that’s what you care about.

They haven’t “fixed” that. It has to do with state regulations regarding financial services businesses. 
Each state has its own requirements, and of course, they’re actively trying to meet those requirements. 
But one by one, as they meet the requirements for one state, another they were previously approved in passes new legislation restricting their services. They’re playing whack a mole at this point

They’re not. Or they are?
But that’s really the definition of a decentralized currency. I think they happen to just overlap. If it’s not fungible it’s not truly decentralized. So I guess the only way to decentralize it is to make it a commodity by the definition of commodity. 
But we also know that the intent of this is a currency, so maybe just redefine commodity? Or call it both. I really don’t care. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:14:29
Correct. That is a non-fungible blockchain commodity. That is not a crypto currency. 
You understand what fungible means right? My only point, was that if a currency was not fungible, that by definition makes it centralized. 
So of course, with cryptocurrencies being decentralized, they HAVE to be fungible. With fungibility being the only definition of commodities, any decentralized currency, crypto or not, is a commodity. There is an overlap there. 
You correctly pointed out they are by definition commodities, my point is that it is soley because of decentralization. 
The only other currency that has ever been also directly considered a commodity, were precious metals which have other utility. Some places (like google) define commodity as: 


Although it has never been defined, in the past, there was some inherent value to every other commodity.

I mean, considering you have to buy BTC to get into most altcoin trading pairs, BTC will be just fine.  People coming into crypto won’t have a choice but to hold bitcoin at a certain point. Even if it’s a temporary move to a permanent altcoin hold. That’s still money going into BTC.

Yeah if Coinbase wants me to actually set up recurring payments, the way to do that would be eliminate the Tx fee if it’s a recurring payment. Seems like a small price to pay as Coinbase to get people to start treating their account like direct deposit.

I knew it was when I was typing it. 
I feel it’s ignorant to even consider the alternative. There simply aren’t enough places to spend it yet. Do some people spend it? Absolutely. Most people don’t. There’s also no way to legitimately find people’s intentions on the blockchain. All we see is a transfer. Unless it’s a known merchant address receiving the coin, and even then we still don’t know who’s sending it most of the time. There’s just no way to track what % of people spend it. 
But I’m in these threads. I talk to people. I know what people want out of bitcoin. It’s not to go to the store and buy milk with it, 80%+ of the time.

Had a conversation with my wife’s grandfather yesterday. 
He’s a major doubter of Cryptocurrencies. Which I cannot get across to him the idea that there are more things beside bitcoin. Doesn’t matter the statistics I bring in front of him, to him it’s the equivalent of going down to the Casino and dropping $1000 on the roulette table. 
He told me yesterday, “Bitcoin lost 30% this week, I don’t know how anyone can see that as anything other than a gamble.” 
Yeah, sure, if you bought a week ago you lost 30%. If you bought a month ago you made 91%. If you bought a year ago you made 1600%. And, I’m barely even in fucking bitcoin. I didn’t lose 30% this week. Despite the entire market crashing I wasn’t even down, I was up 3% yesterday. And today I’m sitting pretty. 
His major argument is, “My Merrill Lynch financial advisor strongly advises against Bitcoin, and he has never steered me wrong in the past”. 
Dude, OF COURSE HE DOESNT WANT YOU IN BITCOIN. If your money is in Bitcoin, how does he make commissions on that money? 
I really don’t know how to make him see that it’s at least a semi-reasonable investment. Understanding that it’s risky but it’s completely revolutionary technology and the idea of a global decentralized currency is in my eyes inevitable.

This leads me to believe
A) you’re lying, or
B) you’re bad at this
in the last year BTC hasn’t done shit compared to the other major coins. So unless your idea of diversification is blowing money in ICOs with a low chance of success, you should be really heavy in ETH and LTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:48:03
When discussing “diversification” on a crypto currency sub, it is assumed you’re meaning within the space. 
And it is also the assumption when referencing Bitcoin you are talking about BTC, rather than cryptocurrencies as a whole. 
Now that I see what you’re saying, okay that’s fine. But a word of advice if you haven’t heard it already, diversify within cryptocurrencies as well as your overall portfolio.

100% depends on the jurisdiction. Each state, county, and city has entirely different rules. 
California has very squatter-friendly laws. It can take as long as a year to get someone evicted. 
A place like New York State is amazing, where NYC itself has different laws from upstate despite being state mandated. In upstate, there are different laws in some of the cities. Syracuse and Albany have their own city codes regarding the matter. 
But once about 5 years ago, I hadn’t payed rent by the time the leasing office had closed at 5pm. At 5:30 when I got home (I was stuck at work) there was a notice of eviction saying I had 24 hours to pay rent, plus a $100 fee, or they would then refuse any future payment and I would have to be out in 10 days. So it can be that quick. I looked into the laws, and sure enough, after that 24 hour period, they could refuse payment and get a court order. At the end of that 10 day period they could show up with a sheriff and throw my shit to the curb.

I don’t know how patent law works at all. Does prior art only apply to people who had these exchanges beforehand? So if JP Morgan tried to create an exchange, they could be successfully sued by BoA because they didn’t have the prior art, right? Sure BoA couldn’t successfully sue Coinbase, but maybe they’re not trying. Maybe they’re doing it to ensure the other banks can’t get their hands in the crypto space. If this is the case, Coinbase would have to use its own money and go out of its way to sue and stop a patent that isn’t being used to come after them.

But regardless of when you got in before, or how much you got on for, it doesn’t matter. Someone can come in today and be at the exact same point or greater. The past only matters to a certain extent. 
We’re talking about the future. From today on. My 10k vs yours. If you’ve already made enough then sure, get out tomorrow. But we’re talking about the speculative bubble and when and how or if people will lose money.

It’s more the other way around. Because I put $1000 into it a bit ago he thinks our financial future has come to an end. Every time bitcoin goes down even a little bit he’ll text me some ridiculous article about how this is the end of crypto. 
Edit: I guess I should qualify all of this and say that although he is biologically her grandfather, he is more or less her father. We talk a few times a week, 90% of the time having nothing to do with crypto. This is just an ongoing thing of his doubt and my relentless bullishness. And the picture made me think of him, thinking... how can I get him to be memegrandpa?

I’m not sitting in fiat. I agree it is lucrative right now. And I’m enjoying it. I’m also not putting my house on another mortgage for it. 
Only dumb people think this will continue forever. And only dumb people **know** they’re going to be able to get out at the right time. Because none of us know when that time is. 
I believe in the future of crypto. Wholeheartedly. That doesn’t change the fact that the landscape of the industry will look entirely different than it does now, in 2, 5, and 10 years from now. And in the process of that landscape transformation, some people are going to get burned. Plain and simple. 
I love the industry. I believe I see the future of it. But the reality is, we aren’t producing anything tangible. And the only way for someone to make money, is for others to lose it. Moving forward, ALOT of money will be made. Which also means a lot of money will be lost.

The unfortunate reality of marriage is when you marry someone you **don’t** just marry that person. You don’t necessarily marry their family if they don’t talk to them, but you marry their entire lives. Their friends, their family, their job. 
My wife cares what he thinks. So I care. It’s really that simple. We talk and talk often. About politics and technology and a billion things. I’m being hyperbolic in the notion that he thinks I’m an anti-government futuristic loon, and our disagreement on the subject is much bigger of a deal on this thread than it in our real lives.

Don’t do any single one. That’s how people get fucked. 
Diversify on trusted exchanges. It’s more time consuming, and takes a lot more thought and evaluation. 
On those exchanges, diversify your holdings in trusted coins. Don’t just buy XLM on binance. If you’ve decided you’re trading XLM, own it on Binance, Bitrex, Polo... etc. 
Say you’re on 5 exchanges with your money evenly distributed. Now, when there’s a hack, AT MOST 20% of your holdings are exposed. If you’re diversified within that exchange, that number continues to drop.
