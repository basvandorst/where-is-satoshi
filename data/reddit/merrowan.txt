[I guess he does HODL...](
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:05:12
true yup, although this one has only ever seen 2 outgoing tx's and none incoming. I actually just think he forgot about it / lost the keys or became otherwise uninterested in the pennies he got for his post :P

$1.25 :P - but hey, he didn’t lie

Haha, I'd like to assume that the 2 tx's that went into that wallet were just little tips from his original hodl post... I hope haha

Not entirely sure I understand your question...   
I'm assuming you're new here?   
There are many ways to hold and send your bitcoin:   
Use a hardware wallet like Ledger/Trezor  
Use a software wallet such as Samurai / Exodus / Jaxx  
These solutions allow you to keep your private keys. Which options you choose depends on how much money you want to hold in a wallet as well as how much risk you're willing to take. As a rule of thumb cold wallets (like a ledger) are safer than a hot wallet like Exodus for example.

Man, I think people are so distracted by things that are so unimportant and ignoring the red flashing lights!

I do like your point about making it difficult to criminalize it and spread the usual drug related claims! 
Agreed that they do use tax money to pay for things, my main point there was that if they’re smart they’d likely use fiat first, and since none of these governments have disclosed what they do with the bitcoin, and certainly haven’t said they’d pay their vendors with bitcoin, it seems like they might not be spending it. 
Best case scenario they liquidate it immediately.
Also an interesting point there, and I’m sure you will have been careful to separate links between your cold wallet(s) and any wallets you use regularly, many people won’t do this, or even know that they should, which is a bit of a privacy concern.
I just think that there’s a lot of work to be done before we hand real money to the organizations that destroyed the last real money we had.

We all have different thresholds of how much money we consider “enough” or “a lot” so there isn’t really a right or wrong answer in terms of when do you buy a HW.
What your intentions are also matter, so do you want to save the bitcoins, will you trade, or will you spend it? 
If you’re going to spend it, just get a mobile wallet app and store A backup of your keys someplace safe. Goes without saying you should secure your phone as best you can.
If you’re trading it, then you’d hold it (or some of it) on an exchange. 
As I’m sure others have said and will say, the private keys to your wallet on an exchange will never be yours, so it’s at your own risk. It’s important to think of exchanges like banks, because that’s what they are. Banks are great and everyone loves them until they aren’t great anymore, and they suspend withdrawals (many many cases of banks and exchanges doing this) or block you for some arbitrary reason and want you to jump through loopholes. I don’t ever recommend storing your money on an exchange if all you plan on doing is storing it. 
I know it’s a pain to have to look after your private keys, or a HW and it’s seed phrase, it can even be stressful - it should be, it’s your money, for the first time ever in our lifetimes we can truly own our own money, and that’s one hell of a responsibility, and also totally worth it.
If you plan on saving it, and possibly adding more over time, then get a HW, if this is the case it’s never too early to secure your money. If you’re concerned about the cost of a nano because for example, you don’t have a whole lot of bitcoin yet, create a paper wallet and send more to that address whenever you can until you’re ready to purchase a HW.
We all have our own goals and ideas about how we want to use (or not use) our coins, so that should be the main factor behind how you store your coin.

And by tax you mean the government of Australia can’t steal from her to fund policies that could undermine her privacy like they did just days ago? 
Also, she is publicly advertising her address, so it would not be difficult for a government to tax (read: steal from) her by just looking at the address.
