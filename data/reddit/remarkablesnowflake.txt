Yes, and make sure it's Bitcoincash or Bitcoin Cash. It's currently 11x cheaper than it's off-chain conglomerate controlled brother "Bitcoin" or Bitcoin Core we call it now.

Hmm wonder why they wouldn't have sold more BCH than the other way around.. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:50:13
Fair enough. Thank you for the sole sensible answer out of 5 crossposts.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:12:26
LOL I just noticed the face.. that's the Gox guy I remember. My god.. the rage the Goxxers must have. I couldn't have handled it. Glad I just mined and didn't fuck around with any of that!

In year 2063: "We just can't expect to have a stable price at 100M USD if people have 5,000 BITCOINS in one WALLET! Are you fucking KIDDING ME, that's like BLUE WHALE meets BRONTOSAURUS"
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:29:53
New insight!
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:24:56
But to the main point of this lad's thread..... "the most bullish news we've ever encountered" is complete nonsense
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:27:12
If I were a multi billionaire I'd stick my dick out on all the exchanges with an elaborate batcave tradestation with teams of koreans working for me, buying up everyone's bitcoin and making sure no shitcoins anywhere ever receive any gains (so that the scammers eventually realize they've been pumping their own dicks and they're running in circles)
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:30:37
And? I have unlimited email addresses, IP's? Why not just let people speak? It would save all of us (mostly them) a lot of time!
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:04:39
Sure I understand all of that. But I don't understand why we need different tokens. I see companies having shares, that have certain bitcoin values attached to them, which one could invest in if they believe that company is going to strive. But all of the things you are talking about could be handled with regular software I feel. I mean do you really need a p2p network to verify your farm's humidity? Why not a redundant system. Plus why would the integrity matter so severely. I don't know, just seems like it would be unneeded for a lot of things you mention. Why wouldn't the worker want to receive a single token type that everything else uses. To verify your worker is completing his task, there would be other means that could be accomplished without blockchain integrity and assurance.

Yes, there will loads more sell pressure. And the number of shitcoins will go from 10,000 to 100,000, as they try and scam everyone entering crypto by offering them pointless tokens and icos. The forecast of BTC's price looks dimmer and dimmer in the long run (since people are just so fucking stupid)
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:23:39
Yep, we're at 3 comments now. Where did the respondent go? I would like some insight please. Thanks
@_date: 2018-03-07 23:24:15
Yes. Every hour there will be a news breaking story now that BTC is crashing, it's the end of the world, check out my ico, blah blah blah. The exchanges don't have any liquidity to pay out anyone, or fulfill withdrawals. If all that fails for the exchanges there's always tether to print off!
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:22:48
It says I have 1 comment, but I do not see 1 comment here.
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:53:36
Great, another pointless Biance` post so that they can get their shitty tether exchange in the title. It's all FAKE NEWSSSS
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:50:27
Excuse me, 9x cheaper. Better hurry
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:35:51
You forgot the last part. Where you think you've made it and then decide to take some profits. The exchange locks up and offline. Agents watch and wait until you can't stay awake any longer and then immediately go back online and dump it.
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:49:13
Good, sell your 150k+ coins, pussy! Bet you won't, you ugly Asian bastards! I've been wanting to scoop up some more $500 BTC for a long time.
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:09:40
that's like... 2 tether deposits for a big exchange. Nothingburger
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:23:58
Good points, I did not know any of this. Hopefully it's all true.
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:32:05
Unforunately, I have to lower myself to this form (name calling) of argument in order to get any attention. Since the Core coin has no valid arguments outside of "btrash", "Roger is traitor?", etc
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:10:00
Much more than 25,000. They've identified the (likely) deposits, which were in batches of 6k and 8k. It was something like 60,000.
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:35:41
buttchain gold, they will call it?
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:18:47
Nailed it. Only thing you can do is buy BCH and do not use any exchange outside of Coinbase and Gemini. Maybe a few other exchanges these days I am missing, but CB is legit and is actually a good guy despite all the fud
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:23:39
It was 36,000 BTC and 34,000 BCH. With a approximate value of say, .125BCH/BTC value (which is extremely lenient but I'm took lazy to analyze the real data - probably more like ~1.4-1.5 during that time period). This is equivalent to well over 40m. So I was around 10% closer in my ballpark approximation than the 25k guess. I guess I win, unless this is the Price is Right, maybe?
EDIT: With an* approximate.. remember guys, use an before vowels!
EDIT  too* not took
@_date: 2018-03-09 00:46:53
Great I would like to see the report, you can send me the link on here. If it was an official report we would know the exact number. This makes things easy!
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:05:15
Nah.. with the amount of corruption, lies, fake news, scams, and everything else you can think of that we'll have - which scales exponentially as it becomes more and more popular and mainstream - will destroy it before it becomes anything truly ubiquitous (free, integrated into everything seamlessly). 
I do see it as some type of common protocol (which is already is, just very underused and in a unique p2p fashion we call blockchain) that network/service providers use in order to facilitate transactions - like for example, you have a bitcoin address (similar to email address) which the provider gives you a custom vanity address, cell phone app, wallet, etc, in exchange for your spending habit data/transaction fees/market liquidity (which we already have e.g. BitPay). Basically this article is already true and it's being portrayed as if it's in some distant future this will happen.
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:34:00
I understand it's cheaper and easier to use, probably has many loopholes as well. I just don't see why they are so heavily invested in USD and why it's integrated into the trade system so heavily. Seems like they would use their own currency for this, unless of course they had a large number of USD customers, which obviously they do not since they're not allowed.
@_date: 2018-03-09 00:45:17
This sounds like a perfect utopia. Except I would get rid of all the tokens, and instead everything would be transacted on one scalable and transparent chain. With eventual evolution into one overarching centralized foundation which governs everything, however, said organization and members would be publicly monitored in a method that would seem outrageous today, but nonetheless effective at keeping all sides happy about transparency.
And finally a fully integrated global blockchain voting system, in which we can finally fucking get rid of politicians.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:43:27
It's not a bug. It gives full transparency. Which, as uncomfortable as it may be, is really the only way it's possible in our reality. FULL transparency for everyone
