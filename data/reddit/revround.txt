Which is really funny since Mars One is the real scam here.  You may not be able to hold a bitcoin but its more real than a magical mission to Mars

The crazy thing is that Kanye isnt really that old, if he wasnt so stuck in his own egotistical bubble he could understand the ways of the internet.  Instead Kanyes default response to everything seems to be to fly off the handle

So that is the reason Mars One is now accepting bitcoin

The mods were trying in vain to make the sub decent once again.  The reason why became so bad is because the LCD was in full effect.  The more people who come into a sub, the lower the quality of posts got because the lowest common denominator between everyone goes down which means that more low quality/effort posts get upvoted.  When the original members experience this they start to grumble but the now majority of shit posters shout them down because they like their shitty posts.  When the mods tried to do something about it the children that now ruled the roost got angry mumbling about freedom and whatever other nonsense and could not realize the cesspit that they created and now wallow in proudly. 
That is exactly why it got taken off of default, there was no hope for the children that had taken over and it only served to make both reddit and atheists look bad by reinforcing negative stereotypes.  
This is also the reason why most smaller subs tend to be a lot better than larger subs

was a complete shithole as a default sub.  The mods tried to clean up the sub to make it more tolerable and all the children started screaming because they loved their shitty memes and obsessive jerking.  was a lost cause at that point and that is why its default status was taken away

Them trying to stop bitcoin on their devices is just one in quite a list of reasons why I dont buy apple products.  A company that sells absurdly overpriced products does not deserve respect

Back when I was ah..... broadening my horizons Erowid was a go to resource to know what you are getting into before you try something.  Great site

Its going to be a turbulent road for a bit here now that Silkroad got shut down.  Hopefully I can buy some near the bottom and hope it rebounds

I think the problem is that typically in other markets a pre-order is a guarantee that you will get a certain product on the release day (or if otherwise stated).  There is an expectation that you will receive what you paid for without any fuss.  Unlike other markets though, the companies who sell bitcoin miners seem to take the idea of a pre-order fast and loose with promises and nebulous release windows that wont commit to a dates who are more than happy to take your money upfront while making refunds as arduous as possible or just flat out refusing.  
This is a bad thing for the community as a whole because it taints the image of those who are selling miners and the bitcoin community in general as full of scammers trying to make a quick buck with pretty little lies and thus detracts from bitcoin in general as a legitimate currency.  Fraudulent people exist everywhere, but there seems to be a very high percentage of shady dealings when it comes to those who promise ASICminers. 
Whether one should pre-order anything at all is a different argument, but in any market we need to have a certain amount of trust in the businesses involved.  You can be upset that a pre-order may not have turned out as great as you thought it would, but in that case at least they delivered on what was promised.  When it comes to bitcoin miners you have to wonder if a product will even ship at all

In other news, its nice that you laid out all those bitcoin related sites to take a fancy picture for karma

When it crashed from 270 it dropped off like a cliff.  This seems more like a market correction than a burst, I mean its still around $600 which is a massive gain over the last bubble burst and overall for the year.  The suicide hotline thread is pure short sighted sensationalism and that is all it is

It kinda depends on the context.  If they are street dealers then no, they probably arnt and you should be avoiding those type anyways.  If its some guy you actually drop by to get some stuff usually they are chill dudes and you hang out for a bit.  Also it can depend on the drug, weed is obviously the most laid back since many people dont even think it should be illegal in the first place so its more like a cool dude who just happens to sell weed on the side too.  There are plenty of nice guys who sell all sorts of things, but things can get a bit more dicey when you get to folks selling hard drugs 
Of course buying online is a different ballgame since you dont actually have to meet face to face and since they are running an online operation and using bitcoins, they are probably pretty on the ball

They can wait until their older......
Everything seems for more important and consequential when you are young and becoming an adult seems so far away.  The truth is that its not that long before you are "legally" an adult so really just wait they will have all the things their teenage mind desires if they just have patience, its part of growing up

Not only that, but there are so many online retailers that offer paypal as a payment option that it will open the door to so many possibilities.  So far it has been a slow rise in individual business that will accept bitcoins, but if paypal starts accepting bitcoins then it shortcuts the individual decision and makes them applicable by default for all sorts of places

Youtube and Yahoo comments are pretty much the shit tier of comments sections on the internet.  Only read them if you have a high tolerance for stupidity and unrestrained hate

It just comes off as blogspam that is made to create interest in bitcoins.

OP is a saint.  This absolutely worked and I got my money back in about 12 hours.  Its a no nonsense way to get a refund without trying to deal with those fraudulent chucklefucks at BFL.

Considering that torrent sites have to find other countries to base their servers in just to avoid getting shut down, it shocked me that something that seems even more illicit would try to run it from the US.  You would have thought they would have known this would happen eventually

I honestly have never seen a sub fall so hard to the LCD effect in such a short time period as Over the last couple weeks there have been threads that were seriously posted by children. I remember a post several weeks ago was a 14 year old giving advice "logic bombs" on how other 14 year old kids could convince their parents to let them invest in bitcoins.  They dont seem to grasp what bitcoin is, its purpose for existing, and that it is incredibly unstable this early in its life, they act as if its fun money that will shoot them to the moon.  The suicide hotline thread is just symbol of how completely absurd this sub has become.  I think has replaced for the most high intensity nonsense and circlerjerking on reddit

My head is spinning from the absurdity of this thread.  The LCD effect has taken a firm hold on this sub and its sliding fast.  Seriously reading all these comments that are basically ansgsty teenagers bashing their parents and talking about how enlightened and intellectual they are at their age and how their parents just cant *understand*.  You know, just like the phase most teenagers go through.

Actually the whole point to scams like the Nigerian ones are not that they think most people are idiots and will buy into it, in fact most people know they are bullshit and those are the people they dont even want to waste their time on so they actually work as a gullibility check.   Once they do find someone gullible enough respond they know they are the right sort of person to milk and then string out that person for all they can get.  All they need is one idiot every so many hundreds of emails to keep the operation going
