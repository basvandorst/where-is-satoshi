This is good! Who do you do business with is not my concern. Choosing a local company over BitPay is actually a plus in my opinion. I will pay in bitcoin for my next purchase on F64, provided I can pay without needing to sign up with btcxchange. Thanks for the answers! Cheers!

No problem, your or any others input is very much appreciated. This is something I can't solve on my own that is why I asked. Maybe someone has a better way.
@_date: 2014-12-18 08:15:40
In my opinion, the only thing you are right about is that r/bitcoin is infested with tippers/beggars/fakers. This looks like a witch-hunt. Blame the tools for the poor job.
@_date: 2014-12-09 15:58:57
Actually there was the blockchain.info problem plus the PBMining potential scam.

It is a very good idea. How do you plan to handle security risks? Viruses could make browsers pay for unwanted web traffic. Leaks would be very hard to discover if they were rare enough.

F64 declared their intent to support bitcoin payments back in October but i cannot find any official statement they are doing it now. Do you have any link confirming it? The photo contest is on their blog so that is very much confirmed: 
@_date: 2014-12-08 16:27:10
This is exactly why I said it is hard to do and why I cannot recommend it to my friends with a clean conscience. There is no straight forward way of doing it easy and secure at the same time. Bitcoin is missing one piece before becoming what we all wish it would be, isn't it?

Where is it located? (City/Country)

If I knew I would have asked here a few more questions. Just received an answer to my email. I will post more in the evening. Thanks for your answers.
@_date: 2014-12-12 09:24:38
The answer I got from F64 is that the payment will be processed by a third party private bitcoin exchange, btcxchange.ro, which is not what I had hopes for, especially because, from what I understand, I have to create and log into an account of btcxchange to authorize the payment (which translates into F64 is not accepting Bitcoin, btcxchange does and then sends fiat to F64). Is this correct?
@_date: 2014-12-11 08:48:40
 Are you in any way affiliated with F64?
@_date: 2014-12-08 11:08:24
Indeed, there is the bitcoin option but only for paying when you pick-up the product. It is not available for delivery. Also the option is well hidden. It seems more and more companies say they support bitcoin but fail to advertise it. This is not a coincidence. Meanwhile, there is still no reply to my email to F64.
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:10:57
You could be right but while BC.I problem was handled the pbmining problem can be perceived as an alarm signal for all the other cloud mining companies. I read all sort of complaints on reddit lately. Not necessarily true but overall the vibe is not very positive. The NY news seemed to be the only good news as I see it.
@_date: 2014-12-16 20:41:41
The first paragraph seems like propaganda. The second offers some insight. The third is just what bitcoin is and my favorite one. Congrats! What you wrote is a nice incentive.

It would be nice to check them for us. You should include deposit fees for each country.

I just wanted to buy something with bitcoin from them and I have found absolutely NO way of doing that online. 
There is no bitcoin on their payment methods list.
I have just sent them an email asking for an explanation.
@_date: 2014-12-08 13:22:17
Yes, you are right, I see it now. I believe it might have been a javascript error on their website because I am quite sure the delivery option did not contain any payment method (not even the other ones) when i tried it. I contacted them using the form in the suggestion and complaints section.
@_date: 2014-12-08 15:20:02
Using bitcoins is easy and convenient for transactions but making sure your funds are secure is the hardest thing I have ever tried to accomplish, financially speaking. At this moment I can't pitch blockchain technology to an average person because I cannot assure him/her of the security of their assets. Is there a way for anyone to follow as best+easy practice to secure your bitcoins?

The payment method "Bitcoin" is missing from the advertised list:

Is this ATM used both for cash withdrawal and deposit (buy + sell)? 
If a fee applies to both then the profit should be constant and risk of loss minimized. Volatility should be less risky this way and you could lower the fee.

Generate a new BC address. Encrypt the private key with a password. Write both public address and encrypted key on a piece of paper. You can make multiple copies. You can deposit anytime, spend only once. You can use Mycelium to import this I think. Makes sense?

How come people unable to handle basic math get to have 8000$?

Please make the results public. 
At least show partial results privately at the end of the survey like any other decent surveyor. 


@_date: 2015-01-30 04:49:10
Because of its nature BC has an advantage for long distance transactions. I think one could buy shares in a company easier with BC. Also digital content/property is best suited. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 00:21:33
Checked! It's still there.

I tried combinations of different characters first, then moved on to repeating 2 or 3 combinations like A122. I figured if the 4th was an unicode figure I wouldn't stand a chance. Your inspiration prooved me wrong. Anyway, i learned some C# programming in the proccess, tried 3 multithreading techniques and had some fun with this puzzle.

It also depends on the method used to format the drive as far as I know. Quick format only erases the file records, while full format also overwrites the existing data.
Edit: I keep copies of my seed in multiple places so that if I loose one I still have backups.

I tried to spend 0.001 without fees a few weeks ago just to experiment (had it as leftover in old blockchain.info account). Never confirmed. 10 days after, I waited until it expired then spent the same amount successfully by including a fee.

Imagine if the time-lock could be included in the protocol as an option at key/address creation. You could get alerts if one would try to steal from you.

Fees are optional and affect only priority. When block rewards won't be an incentive to mining, it is expected that fees will.

What's with the conspiracy theory? It is a public note that got scrambled due to encoding (my guess). I am curious what the note says. If it says what you wrote, doesn't have much sense, does it?

I wasn't aware this was an English community. I wasn't trying to 'lie' or 'twist', that's why I linked the article. I was just sharing some information and offering my opinion on it. 
In the last but one paragraph the author states that the bad part about Bitcoin is that nobody oversees the volume of BTC issued, unlike any other central bank in the world. I can't read it otherwise.

Just an idea: I might be wrong because I don't really know everything about Bitcoin insides but I think the cap is about miner fees. If the network can handle more transactions per second, people would be spending less on transaction fees as you can make more 0 fee transactions in a timely manner.
