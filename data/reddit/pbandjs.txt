Doesn't feel right, but I still decided to jump in more at $315. I think we'll see $400 before it's over

This is a point I actually hadn't considered that may be an issue.

This is what I came to learn about. Not only will your bitcoins be linked to your gmail address, but more than likely also linked to your phone, other cc's and your purchases. 
One part of me thinks this is awesome, a very easy way to spend money not tied to a government influenced currency. The other side says that this could potentially make secure anonymous transfers in bitcoin's future more of a challenge. 
Whatever it may be, if Google did present interest in this, it will only further give bitcoin legitimacy, and that's exciting.

If I grasp what you are saying, Google can't restrict you from having a secondary wallet (etc) account not linked to a cc or name? Probably not. 
Having any service with Google decreases any chance of anonymity. They monitor *everything* you do. 
Regardless, I don't think they will allow an anonymous wallet anyway. Of course I would hope otherwise.

Currently there is no such thing as Google Bucks. Google Wallet uses your credit card, or even paypal irc, which ties to your gmail account.

Tell that to Wallstreet and the people who run the government

Interesting I guess.
I don't really know why blockchain.info has these posted anyway. Literally, I don't see the significant value for anyone. 
Exploit the wallet? Maybe. Any positive purpose... to show how many unique users they have?
Maybe I'm missing something here.
