They are fine. They updated OpenSSL and aren't vulnerable anymore.
Most sites are safe now, but you can check [here]( if you aren't sure

right, wasn't thinking all the way through. its not enough to just stop people from doing heartbleed again.
would CAs revoke and issue new certificates for free in this situation?

Yes, on my desktop; however, my desktop is connected to a television with lower resolution than a standard computer monitor. Things on my screen tend to be zoomed a little more so I have a slightly different experience from others on most web pages.

He was never charged with anything, his case was either dismissed or settled. It's all allegations as of now

AdBlock is like putting a "no soliciting" sign on your door. If a website really needs to, they can require they whitelist their website or just block AdBlock users entirely. 
What's even worse than some ads being obtrusive, is that the ad provider can track you individually and what sites you visit as the ads are loaded from the advertiser's servers (typically). 
What a lot of people seem to miss is that AdBlock is also a way of preventing third parties from tracking and datamining you

megamultipool.com is a good pool that mines multiple currencies, switching to the most profitable coin based on coinwarz.com ratings.
There is a scrypt and sha-256 auto-switching pool.
You can turn on Auto-trade and it will automatically convert the altcoins into LTC and BTC for you

The top sponsored ad on a search for firefox seems like a place to download firefox but actually serves malware. It was reported as early as February! And it was up as of last week, there was a big thread about it on /g/ and many people were saying that malware in Google ads is much more common than most would think.
It's really a shame. It's even worse though with people getting malicious bitcoin wallets, because new users may get a bad image about bitcoins and Bitcoin in general
Edit: the firefox one was taken down, I guess the flood of people from the thread on /g/ finally did it. But still, it was reported four months prior and was just recently removed. Imagine all the people who could have been affected.

Just watched this episode less than a week ago.
For those who don't know, George was actually eating mango slices and when he says "it moved", he is referring to his bowels after a long spout with constipation. He then grabs two handfuls of mango slices, and heads off to the can, shouting "I'm back baby!", referring to the return of his regular bowel movements.
EDIT: Sorry, I'm getting episodes mixed up :/ substitute constipation for erectile dysfunction and bowels for penis in my text above and the story fixes itself up

Exactly, they aren't going to hunt anyone down to give them their coins. Take responsibility and file a claim

They were seizing assets from an illegal operation, what should they have done differently? 
They couldn't just leave them there, and they couldn't call or mail a letter to every user. I don't see what's wrong with how it was handled.

Seems like a great site that functions as it needs to. Although in my opinion the "sign up" section being at the top and taking up nearly the entire screen initially is a little obtrusive. Maybe a small bar across the top with a link to a separate sing up page? Trivial detail, but just how I feel.
I would rather have the section below that (that describes what Onarbor is about) be the first thing I see.

Do you know what the fees are?
