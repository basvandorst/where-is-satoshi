Use  a floating price ad. Solves this problem.

Just wanted to say, that I learned a lot from Bitcoin Magazine. These guys did a fantastic job.

Maybe bitcoin isn`t that male-dominated afterall. I think that 14 attendees is pretty damn good for an exclusively female BTC meetup!

I have just withdrawn from my account with JS enabled and I had NO PROBLEMS.

What is the domain of the phishing site? It helps to report it at google: 
I have seen localebitcoins and localbiitcoins before. Has this one a different domain?

Cool, I will definitely check out the participating shops once it has started. I am a bit sceptical that they will manage to get 30 merchants on board (Berlin has a bit less than that despite having six times the population and a very lively bitcoin scene) but I would be delighted to be wrong with that prediction!

Spot the odd ones out in their list of vendors who accept bitcoin.

Can somebody explain to me what is the difference between SSH and bitAuth?

The bump in Germany is probably due to bitcoin being featured on a very popular sciency TV-show called Galileo. It was a very positive about BTC

Imho the paper wallet makes a nice (physical) wedding souvenir. Also I don't know if you can see it on the photo but it was only one item in a small paper box containing also a handmade candle, a seeshell and a miniature plant. They put some thought into it.

They have Cake 3.0! I heard it tastes much better than Cake 2.0.

The internet replaced (and is replacing) lots of things: snail mail, encyclopidias, catalogs, the list goes on and on and on. And bitcoin has novel applications as well like smart contracts and multi signature

We should all click on it repeatedly until they run out of budget for the ad.
@_date: 2014-08-08 14:32:37
They said that they didn`t. I guess if Aunt Beatrice isn`t going to look in her wallet, this will increase the value of the wallets of the rest of us.
@_date: 2014-02-08 15:32:19
I think in 5 years many people will be able to use bitcoin only and never touch fiat again.
@_date: 2014-05-28 18:03:00
No, then it is a regular ad. You have to check the floating ad check box. It will take 10% more into escrow to account for price fluctuations.

:D Love it. Only: "I need to give you my wallet address" should have been "I need to give you my private key"

I had the same experience with a restaurant called Indian Gate in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. I read on this subreddit that they accept BTC and I asked the waiter twice before ordering anything. After we finished our meal they said: sorry, we didn't set it up yet.
 Another place that only accepts bitcoin when the owner is around personally is Devils kitchen in Berlin. Also you better have NFC on your phone or it won't work. The personnel there didn't get any training how to accept it and thus cannot explain how this NFC setup works.

Awesome! I will definitely try it when I go to London in November :)

If you live in Berlin and want to purchase it with bitcoin, you can buy it at Otherland bookstore. They will have it!
@_date: 2014-08-24 09:10:09
+1 for the transaction export. I have tagged all my past transactions and I would love to keep it.
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:26:57
If you want to own bitcoin and get involved, I have an idea for you: go to some brink and mortar merchant (somebody you know already) and offer them to buy their bitcoins, if they make revenue in bitcoin. Become the "Bitcoin godfather" of a shop, so to say. It helps everyone involved.

I am super happy that my favourite coffee place in Berlin-Friedrichshain is now accepting bitcoin. They have set up a proper wallet themselves and are not going the Bitpay/Coinbase route. If you live in Berlin or plan to visit, make sure to drop by in Boxhagener Str. 74 (near Ostkreuz). The coffee is superb!
Would you be interested in ordering coffee from their website (  )? Right now bitcoin is not implemented into their online-shop, but if there is demand they might do it. Please comment and I will let them know.

In Berlin most of the bars/cafes simply use Andreas Schildbach`s Bitcoin Wallet on a tablet and go with 0 confirmations. Room 77 (which has the highest volume in bitcoin transactions) hasn`t had a double spend ever. 
If you would try a double spend, you would go for items with higher value and not for a bar bill.

Can somebody send me some coins on testnet so I can test the app?
@_date: 2014-06-13 11:09:34
Bitcoin meetups in Berlin have between 5 and 50 attendees.
@_date: 2014-08-08 14:33:58
something between 5 and 10 bucks
@_date: 2014-05-29 14:18:50
make sure to post it to coinmap.org, so I will remember when I visit Vienna.
@_date: 2014-08-24 13:13:58
Thanks a lot for the link, Mike!
@_date: 2014-08-08 14:33:02
yes, approximatley.

That's right but there are some spammy entries among them. Bitcoinkiez.de is the better curated site regarding Berlin. If you remove all the chaff there are not more than30.

We have recently implemented bitcoin-acceptance in our onlineshop. So if there are any bitcoin-loving Reggae-Vinyl-heads out there, check out our shop! Currently we are using the bitpay-API. But we will move to a different hosting provider next month. Then we will have the means to run bitcoin directly on our own server and I might implement "real" bitcoin acceptance without bitpay.

I think I guessed even lower. Never been happier to be proven wrong!
@_date: 2013-05-09 09:06:23
We might do that, it depends on the LPs. You could send a list of what you want to sell to info(at)buyreggae.com. Then we can tell you, if we are interested in buying your LPs. Cheers!
@_date: 2013-12-04 08:27:17
Awesome! Will print some...

You can buy it with bitcoin at 
They are a bookshop specialised on Science Fiction and accepting BTC. They do mailorder, too.
