So you think that people will not choose a wallet the NSA has it's hands on? I disagree considering the strong likelihood that Bitcoin itself is an NSA/Darpa/IMF creation. The overwhelming majority are already completely devoted to an oppressive financial system. They love it. They want to be chipped out of "convenience".

which is why the hardware wallet that wins will come from a large trusted company that wouldn't bother trying to steal people's bitcoins with that kind of exploit.

but the government is powerless against math. These people have digitized themselves onto the blockchain where they can live in peace and where no evil governments can travel. Incredible times.

"Most" as in the majority of Chinese citizens own multiple homes? Who knew. I was under the impression that the majority of Chinese citizens didn't own 1 home.

Too bad China didn't have more bitcoin exchanges to help the Chinese flee their collapsing stock markets.

from the article:
"Some inquisitive traders on Bitcointalk.org posted a video link "
Really? Let's see the post on bitcointalk with the link. Let's check the date and the info.
Did you watch the video? Any mention of litecoin? The linked address? hahaha awesome. Kudos for whomever put together this fake reveal. 
This is ALL a setup for an actual pump and dump for dashcoin.. whatever the fuck that is.
The attack on coblee and bobby lee makes it seem all so real doesn't it?

Two wheeled stand up gyro vehicles are more popular than the year segway was introduced. If you include all the knock offs and legitimate competition it's likely a billion dollar industry that started from zero.

I said proof.. Like evidence. The post you linked is from yesterday and is part of this story being promoted. In the thread we see someone post "34Ae29qWAhGGTw3cSNkPygiwsgKbbCatou" and simply imply it's owned by the chinese person in the video that is promoting the ltc ponzi. It's all true because some people said so on the internet? Wait a second..this just in! Here's a picture of the ponzi scheme mastermind's house:

People love it even when it sucks.

What proof do you have? It's ALL heresay. I'm not saying there isn't a pump bubble happening right now with LTC. Proof is in the volume and price. But the accusations and story presented here is sophomoric and appears to be completely fabricated for a Dash pump.. whatever the fuck dash is. Just because some people wrote some crap on a chinese forum and showed an address with a bunch of ltc in it doesn't mean anything.

At this rate his calloused wiener will never be removed through punching alone.
@_date: 2015-07-10 12:03:48
Ok so let's see the proof linking the ltc address to the actual pumpers. Let's see the undeniable proof of their control of the private keys to the address.
@_date: 2015-07-10 14:34:57
where's the proof of ownership of that address? Someone's infographic posted yesterday? Come on.

attack bitcoin and pump litecoin. Dump litecoin and stop the attack on btc.

Excuse me, did i subscribe to by mistake?
@_date: 2015-07-10 14:26:06
So some chinese forum hosts a thread of some people presenting a story and an address with a bunch of ltc in it and it's all true because?? And the story is inexplicably tied to an obvious failed dash pump? Why do you want this to be true so badly?
@_date: 2015-07-10 11:59:28
This whole thing is such a sloppy BS story i can't believe anyone would actually fall for this. Did you watch the video? How is this ltc address been tied to this secret pump scheme? Ohhh and btw some inside scoop! they are doing it with DASH next! Thanks haxors for exposing the P&amp;D for us all.

I guess buying bitcoin to buy dogecoin is easy.
@_date: 2015-04-28 19:53:04
We'll never know....Stay in school.
@_date: 2015-04-24 14:50:58
You still have to buy them to "play around with the concept". So what is it about Dogecoin that makes it a better way to learn about crypto than bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-04-27 16:42:37
The problem transactions are the one's that are happening on the street without a referral. Street corners. Something like Silk Road wouldn't work if no one was buying from strangers.

Look at my username.. and I am seriously asking: Is still a thing? People, it's the SEC. They know what a ponzi scheme is. This guy's comment is juvenile and sophomoric. It's a "penny stock". Ok. It's a streetcar!
