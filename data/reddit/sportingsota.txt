I flipped after reading the white paper and doing my own research.

This is absolutely baseless. Other coins transact more than BTC daily.
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:45:25
The only thing you are correct on is that you're not an expert.

Thanks! I am a libertarian that loves the idea of Bitcoin as a decentralized currency for spending and holding money. I also did not invest more than I'm willing to lose. I also made tons of money because I don't try to day trade. But over time.... i buy low, liquidate some (not all) assets when they are high, and buy back when it's low again. This is not Warren Buffet trade secrets, it's common sense.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:35:38
Hoow many do you have? I'll buy them
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:06:57
This will be received well.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:53:33
These same people who buy back in will sell as soon as the value reaches X amount in their head or panic sell again at the next dip. Either way, it's not helping the market long-term.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:46:48
Not at all. I'm doing them a favor. The people who are stressing every minute because they are worried they are going to lose their money are not cut out for bitcoins and stocks. Also, chances are they invested too much.

@_date: 2017-12-10 19:33:37
I'm very sorry that you bought high and sold low.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:58:09
I see what you did there.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:10:44
Well, I hope you didn't lose too much.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:42:52
Good luck
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:56:20
Lol everyone so confident when y'all have no clue.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:47:48
I did not mean to come across as a meany. I'm trying to help people who can't handle it. It's not for everyone. That's what I was trying to get across.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:50:27
I'd rather have people who believe in the product buy in as opposed to FOMOs buying in because those are the people, in mass quantities, that will cause problems in the market.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:59:52
But it jumped 2k from last night. ARE they smart?
@_date: 2018-11-27 12:10:09
I work in SEO/SEM. You are incorrect. This search term within the search console includes all strings and search phrases that include Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:30:11
Gold went up because because the need for precious metals, consumer goods, and use in electronics went up. BTC has no practical use with high fees and long wait times on transactions. So, what is missing here in this gold-BTC comparison is the demand for BTC. Where is the demand? If BTC was an actual decentralized currency that works, there may be something to talk about.

Spoke too soon. Lol

Your lack of understanding of free speech concerns me. Free speech isn't objective to people's opinions of the topic. It is seeking, receiving, and imparting information or ideas, regardless of the medium used.
If it is a fraud, have that open discussion to prove or disprove it. If it's shit, present your facts. Don't just censor because you believe what you believe. That's just totalitarianism.
@_date: 2018-04-19 23:47:27
I am laughing so damn hard right now. Oh the irony...
@_date: 2018-04-21 15:43:58
Angry much?
@_date: 2018-04-19 23:50:50
Nope it's still up.
@_date: 2018-04-19 23:58:13
Yeah, truth tends to make people deflect their anger at others.
@_date: 2018-04-19 23:03:07
You won't get an honest, logical answer, because mods would just censor and delete them. So why even bother asking?
@_date: 2018-04-19 23:43:34
Wow. Oh my. You really don't understand.
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:42:36
Credit card? About 10 seconds. Bitcoin transfer? Couple hours?
@_date: 2018-12-15 19:02:29
I mean, it's possible. He mines BTC still.
@_date: 2018-12-15 18:51:30
Roger said he dumped BTC for BCH.
