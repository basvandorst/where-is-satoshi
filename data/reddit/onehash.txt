Hi! thanks for using OneHash! It is not about computational power. Problem is in the speed of transactions in bitcoins network :)

@_date: 2016-04-06 07:51:29
Our goal is to keep it that way, thanks! 
@_date: 2016-04-07 11:41:48
We'll look into that, sounds like a good idea. Thanks! 
@_date: 2016-04-07 09:04:04
Why is it important? 
@_date: 2016-04-29 12:06:29
bet appears on the list of bets taken into account after 2 confimations , then the whole bet is recalculated with the participation of the new bet
@_date: 2017-02-22 12:30:44
 It's on :)
@_date: 2017-02-22 12:44:28
thank you! Always trust your instinct :) 
@_date: 2017-02-22 12:31:05
Good luck!

That's quite shortsighted of them. There will be another article in r/Bitcoin about M$ reinstating bitcoin support in a few months or so. I know it. 
@_date: 2016-03-29 14:39:34
Not a very comprehensive list. It should get updated after further research. 
@_date: 2016-03-16 09:06:14
100 on this bundle. 100 on another. And one after that. Sounds important enough? ;)
@_date: 2016-03-11 14:49:19
I bet someone who made this is also an user here at r/bitcoin cheers! 
@_date: 2016-03-15 09:56:04
Told ya! 
@_date: 2016-03-15 15:12:41
It probably won't fail but if it did it's that more important to spread the word and get as many adopters and crypto enthusiasts as possible. 
@_date: 2016-03-16 14:42:09
Awesome that forbes decided to investigate the OpenBazaar. Finally there's credibility not so frequent users didn't have. 
@_date: 2016-03-10 14:49:30
Great to see the ecosystem getting more appealing to non-technical and non-ideological folks. Let's keep it going everyone! 
@_date: 2017-02-23 11:12:05
Everything works fine. Do you still have this problem ?
@_date: 2016-03-16 14:53:13
never had this problem but I will keep that in mind 
@_date: 2016-03-11 09:47:27
Good to be on the good side of the fence for this. 60 billion market cap sounds like something finally shutting up the sceptics

Have to agree here. It's like the primary rule in economics. 
@_date: 2016-03-11 10:02:26
Don't you think it's going back a step or two? Why not stick to the advantages of virtual money and make it appaling to people that are not yet convinced?

We have checked the matter and at the time when the game was verified we had the correct result. Later the match officials decided to change the result that caused new result update. Here is an article about this case, please take a look:

First of all, where do you get your estimates about the purchases? Your personal feelings on something that is measureable are worthless here. 
Second, 1% today, can be 10% tomorrow. If everyone thought like you and always chose to dismiss smaller revenue streams most businesses would fall. There's a thing called "long tail" that can be used as a great example. Read about it and maybe it will revise some of your opinions.

On our platform you do not bet regular time score. Just general winner (penalties included). 
@_date: 2016-06-30 08:46:13
Our betting system is different. You do not bet against us, just against other users. So odds often get bigger than on regular betting sites. Scroll down and press "show archive" and you will see what I mean:

Dear simon1828,
First and foremost, we're really sorry that some of your recent bets were rejected. Tough you didn’t win anything, it should be stated that **you didn’t lose even a half of satoshi** by placing these bets either.
The cases you provided here are actually very specific. E-sports games rule its own rights, they are often postponed, cancelled, the data providers have problems with identifying them etc. And that’s basically your case.
Chiefs Esports Club vs Paradox game has been accidentally doubled by our data provider  We’ve had two games between those two teams in our offer, the one that actually happened and the one that was cancelled immediately because - as we mentioned above - it didn’t exist in real life. Unluckily you’ve place a bet on the wrong, non-existent one. Even in your screens you can see that you wanted to place a bet on game in which Paradox were a hosts and Chief Esports Club were guests, while in proper game it was exactly the opposite. Furthermore, you got an info about this event being canceled and automatic return of your input in our customer support service messenger. 
We’re really sorry for this inconvenience, it was a technical problem on which our IT team works so it won't happen again.
And at the end: our five percent margin is not that high comparing to other sportbooks. Check market standards by yourself in separate Bitcointalk thread or at any other websites.
We hope that we explained you what was the issue and that we're not scammers. We understand that you may have some doubts, but remember that we’re 100 % provably fair, full secured platform with great, 5-years reputability. You can make sure by reading OneHash’s reviews of couple independent websites:

Don't hesitate to reach us anywhere, if you guys have some more questions. We’re here to explain every misunderstanding, every problem and to simply help anyone that need help.
