Good job. Where did you find the python script you modified?

are tomatoes and mushrooms competitors? No they work together to make awesome pizza. Same for ltc and btc.

you can't add all the features in one crypto. Do you remember Namecoin? You want btc to store DNS? Do you know Siacoin? it's a crypto for cloud storage. BTC can't do it all, the code would be a mess. And some of others crypto are experimental.

I am a software developer and yes BTC is more complex than you can imagine. When you are building a house with 3 rooms, a toilet and a kitchen, if you want to add another room, you have three solutions : splitting a room in two, creating a room in the garden, or destroying the house and building it again from scratch with more space. It's (almost) the same when you are coding.

i didn't say btc is more complex than windows, i told you btc is more complex than you can imagine. Just look at the issues 
There is more than 400 contributors, all coming from different countries, background etc. Do you know how difficult is it to work in team? Even more when you are working far away from each others. And line count doesn't matter in coding

ethereum is not a threat, it's another kind of blockchain, a blockchain where you can add smart contract. You can use it for everything : storing data etc. BTC and LTC are used as digital currencies. BTC has a lot of fee, it doesn't matter if you buy a house or a car, but if you buy a cheeseburger, the fees are more than the burger itself, so you should use LTC. If your vision of cryptocurrencies does not go farther than trading : yes they are competitors. But if you believe crypto is a lot more than that : no they are not competitors. LTC was the first to implement segwit. If BTC didn't follow they would be two very different blockchain. Today the 2 blockchains are almost the same but what about tomorrow? diversity matters

If you have one crypto for all attributes and the crypto is used by everyone, you can except the block to be always full and a lot of scalability problem. Just look at ethereum and all the shitty ICO inside it

did you use a framework for your website ? If yes which one ?
