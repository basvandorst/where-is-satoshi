Apparently he meant people who lost all their money on bitcoin...

How could you possibly know what I understand or how much research I’ve done to form my opinion? Your rationale is that I don’t agree with you therefore I don’t understand. That’s not sound reasoning.

You started buying at $19k? sorry man, but you missed the party. at best you're a 2-3x with MASSIVE downside risk. most people here have crushed it already. good luck, though.

Putting aside the philosophical anti govt / anti bank rationale, it’s still an asset bubble just like MBS was. I believe you guys will be short term “right”, but I think bitcoin is a house of cards and eventually it’s going to be worth a lot less. There are a number of reasons this could happen, which I’m not going to run through here.
It’s funny you reference the Big Short. Being able to short MBS is what finally crashed the MBS market, and as a result, the housing market. A WSJ reporter was on CNBC this morning reporting that hedge funds are looking for better ways to short bitcoin - better than futures. 
Bitcoin IS the new big short brew... when they get access, and they will, it’s over. And when it crashes I promise there won’t be a bailout for the folks who are leveraging their house to buy fantasy coins. Hope I’m proven wrong because I don’t want anyone to experience misfortune, but I fear I’m right. And as I originally commented - when it happens it’s going to be ugly.
Memo: BTC is currently $16k.

Wait until bitcoin collapses.... will be very ugly

Is there anyway to know if it’s an individual or some sort of exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:40:24
or bitcoin

Your first paragraph is factually inaccurate. If your knowledge of what happened is based on a Hollywood movie, I’m not sure how you can argue in good faith.
I do not understand how you can definitively say “bitcoin is not going to go down” or “bitcoin is going up because”. You have no idea so it’s foolish to make such claims.
I also fundamentally disagree with the statement that an open sourced software platform has inherent value or utility since anyone can and is currently creating competing coins. It’s just wrong.

You should read the article before having a bot remind me in one month. Remind me of what?
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:05:11
I never said any of the things you claim I said. Ever.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:27:50
Ok you I do hope lose all your money. But not the nice people on here. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:20:58
Sorry - see if this works.
 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:23:37

@_date: 2017-11-04 01:31:44
No it’s not Malware clown
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:16:06

Sorry - see if this works.

i'm thinking it's more like a mr. robot type doomsday scenario, where they are assuming an event that disrupts the banking system. i'm not sure what could happen that would result in "the internet is gone", but i probably shouldn't ask...
