I have a dream that people will work for bitcoin rather than buy and sell for gains in fiat. Think long term.

LN node will be different from the main nodes? Assume I decide to run a LN node, I won't have to download the whole blockchain? I'm new to this so im a little confused.

They already had segwit and batching. 
Any reduction in fees or is it the same shit brokerage as before

Export import taxes , commodity taxes, and fractional reserve banking which is now crumbling due to NPAs. 
We live in a ill managed economy and will probably be so for years to come. Bitcoin or not. Shit won’t change. Not being pessimistic, just real.

The main factor in me adopting bitcoin was freedom from the very institutions that screwed and still screw us and many more.
This technology is capable to give each person with a smartphone a bank in their pocket. It's still in it's infancy and I hope the dream of money for the people, by the people truly comes true.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:16:55
thanks for clearing that up. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:10:51
Thats too is too huge a number. Remember only 2.1% pay income tax in our country and zebpay, unocoin and other exchanges combined only have 1.8 Million people are signed up on, that makes roughly 0.01% of INDIANS adopting BITCOIN LEGALLY with a bank account! 
Things look good in terms of adoption jn the future.

I see you’re Indian. Me too! 
Here are some tips: 
1.Keep a mobile wallet like bread for around Rs5,000-Rs.10,000.
2.Anything more than that keep it in a cold pc that is only connected to the internet for transacting cryptocurrencies.
3.Get a hardware wallet if you have above 1 lacs worth of btc!!! 
Its worth it. Btc will pay for itself in 2 weeks time :)

He's right(in a way) , big companies just use the infrastructure created by big telecos and don't invest in it. 
AT&amp;T invests $18B PER YEAR just in US and companies like Google,FB just pay for the cheap services and not invest in infrastructure, thus they will now have to pay more which they will then put on the customers to pay.

Also it depends on what wallet/ exchange you are using. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:40:42
No need to say Sorry, we were all new at some point. 
First of all get this, "If you don't own your private keys, not your bitcoin". Second, get some knowledge about wallets, encryption and types of storage of bitcoins. 
That should clear up some confusions and then the market is in place for YOU to decide which wallet suits your needs(opinions) best.

Care to give an example? and please don't say IOTA.
Also, the purpose of LN is to enable micro transactions between people and businesses, whereas main chain can be directly used for larger transactions ( more than $100).


Understand that other alts are trying to solve the same problem that forks are. Scalability. LN Solves that and renders other alts pretty much useless as they won't hold much value other than trading and not so much of actual use.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:10:38

But seriously, the rule is simple; Educate first and then decide whether it's worth it or not. Don't just jump on the bandwagon cause someone said so.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:23:06
First of all, LN doesn't use blockchain. It uses a payment channel which is end to end encrypted between 2 individuals. 
Only 2 transactions are put up on the blockchain; when you open the channel and when you close it. 
While the channel is open, you can transact any no. of times ( which increases the tx. to millions/s) and thus low fees cause only have to pay while opening and closing the channel. 
Scaling is usually done so MORE PEOPLE can use it efficiently as a means of currency. 
tldr; LN reduces load on mempool with low fees tx. and makes direct blockchain tx. for bigger txs. as bitcoin's price rises.

Can i give them hashing power with my intel hd 5500, I don't even want a reward. Auto-respect after I heard about the 2013-accidental hard fork.

Now that so many people know about Bitcoin(relative to 2014), it’s no longer profitable to mine with regular CPU/GPU added with electricity costs. Enter ASIC; built specifically for solving cryptographic hash problems that PoW requires for a block to be mined. 
Read the white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto:

So? If it is illegal, people will just use external exchanges to buy it. It will be another tax haven for the people. 
Atleast right now exchanges are following KYC regulations and money can be traced. It would be pretty stupid of RBI to outright ban them.

That’s forming a bias before even knowing what he’a done. Good day to you sir. I hope you take better life decisions than this.

They say demand is higher than international markets when 70% of the population lives in villages.

And that is how it's supposed to work. 
I'm actually surprised it's this efficient in finding blocks without Segwit Adoption(on a large scale).

Why not both? Bankers will use any fud possible to keep people’s money with them.

if a miner is getting a full block reward he's not getting 1BTC he's getting 12.5BTC right now. It's unlikely a single miner can outbid or compete with mining pools of China and Ver.

Litecoin is considered a poor man's bitcoin. If you really want the brand value of bitcoin, consider bch to be another option. Sorry for using 'boi' wasn't trying to antagonize you.

Read the header of the subreddit boi, it already says 'Digital Gold' first, then p2p currency. Clearly the mission has changed and I'm fine by that. I'd rather use other cryptos for exchanging coffee.
