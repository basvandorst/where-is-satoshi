They also let you pay for years in advance.

At least the ending (for better or worse) says that "Bitcoin is the future".
Didn't watch the show, but glad the name got out there.

Maybe require the borrower to buy an item instead of actually getting ahold of the BTC.
The BTC never comes into contact with them - instead they have a balance on BorrowaBit.com. 
This would cut down theft a bit because the ~~thief's~~ customer's can only use the balance for certain things - not hoarding, stealing, etc.

"Onsite" backup isn't a backup.

Bitcoin didn't get "Famous" because of the EFF - Bitcoin didn't grow because of the EFF. So I couldn't give a rats ass if they endorse it or not. I just wish I wouldn't have donated to them. :P

Awesome news!

True. It depends on how bad the OP wants the coins though.

I'd say signup for Dwolla account or buy a moneypak card and contact BitCoin Exchange on the forums.

At least I know Google can't do anything to the Bitcoin code. It would be nice to see someone like Google push an open source project like BC.

If you're going to buy them: buy them now! They dropped a bit because one of the major exchanges changed owners + (I think) someone sold alot of their Bitcoins. I bought 10 for UNDER $10.

This is very fishy indeed - you mean to tell me, he doesn't have *any* backups? I make backups of wallets with bitcents in it, and he never made any of his worth thousands of OTHER people's coins? What gives? This isn't bad business practice, this is just plain stupid. &amp;
