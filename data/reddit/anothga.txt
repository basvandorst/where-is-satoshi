Yeah, Coinbase has had a lot of issues these last couple of weeks.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:23:20
Yes, but 20% of 1 dollar is not exactly the same as 20% of 10,000 dollars.
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:17:06
Bitcoin still has a price of about 11k dollars. I wouldn't be calling *that* any bad names.

Wait... How were people paying for the stuff they bought on eBay before PayPal?

You don't need to be over 18 to *have* it but, in light of what others have already said, you might need to be over 18 to *use* it, depending on what exactly you want to use it for.
It's like with real money - you may have some real money regardless of how old you are, but you still need to be of legal age to buy porn, alcohol, cigarettes and the like.

And we all know how that ended for Germany between the two World Wars.

I'd choose being alive and "weak" over being "strong" and dead any time.

But... But... Muh Internet points. D:

I don't know why your post has only 76% upvote rate. What you did seems more than reasonable to me.

"Hey, look. I just casually found 150 dollars in my old pants."

"Accept SegWit or else" is not a con**s**ensus, it's a threat.
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:40:30
Look at you and your fancy common sense.
@_date: 2017-03-09 12:46:15


That's how scams work.
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:51:09


Yes, and it's too bad it's *just* that. A lot of its features would be really nice in vanilla Reddit.
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:23:49
You should probably stop watching all that porn.

There's [Coinomi]( at least on [Google Play]( (App Store version is apparently still in production). They even published [an article]( on how to get your BCH in the wallet if you had some BTC in it before the split.
I have been using it myself for several months now, and I don't have a lot of things to complain about when it comes to it.
Paging who said they don't know about any mobile wallet for BCH.

Reddit without any browser plugins and other stuff like that.

They secrete wallets, just like the screenshot says.

My expectations are to receive the first confirmation within the first 15 to 20 minutes. In reality, it can sometimes take me over an hour, and sometimes several.

"I'm not accusing anyone, bro. Just sayin'."
@_date: 2017-04-17 06:16:16


There's the problem.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:45:36


Get out of here, you and your common sense.

Dear Lord, Mt. Gox really was a mess, wasn't it?

tfw can't read that without that melody playing in my head.

Well that was entertaining.

This is what I'd like to know. How does one quantify this "instrinsic value" you speak of?

For a moment, I thought your username was captainkebab and was like "wait a second..."

"Here's some pocket money, sweetheart."
"And now I'm in jail. *Thanks*, mom."
