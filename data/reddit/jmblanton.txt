People are working on that.

Ah, proof by assertion.

The chain doesn't split unless a significant fraction of the nodes and miners refuse to upgrade.  As long as (almost) everyone upgrades, the chain doesn't split.  Any holdouts simply fork themselves off the network until they upgrade.
Hard forks are quite safe unless they're contentious.  As long as the vast majority of the network agrees with the changes, the fork won't result in a chain split.

Scheduled protocol upgrade on May 15.  It has to be done via hard fork because the changes aren't backwards-compatible.  But there won't be any chain split.

None.  ~~misunderstands the nature of the upcoming protocol upgrade.~~

Oh, I see.  You were talking about *other people* expecting an airdrop.  Gotcha.

Yes.  Any miner who doesn't upgrade would risk producing an invalid block.
During the last hard fork, someone accidentally(?) mined a block on the old chain.  Then some other people picked it up and ran with it.  They called it "Bitcoin Clashic".  There's a chance the same thing will happen again this time.  But professional miners like to get paid for their work, and they're not going to risk following a minority fork with ~0% support.

Sorry, but I'm going to answer your question.
Any un-upgraded nodes will continue to follow the chain until they see a block that doesn't follow the old rules.  At that point, they will reject the block and wait for a "valid" one.  But the miners are now mining on the new "invalid" block.  Old nodes won't accept any blocks that build on the new one.  They will wait forever for a block that will never come.
