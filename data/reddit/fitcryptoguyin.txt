P:s bitcoin is neither illegal nor legal in india..there are no rules and regulations untill now so u shouldn't worry abt taxes right now.

International exchanges don't allow u to deposit funds in INR..u must creat account in an indian exchange in order to buy bitcoin.After buying bitcoin u can send them to any wallet in internation exchange like coinbase , kraken .It is best advised to keep your bitcoina in a hardware wallet like trezor or nano s where u own ur private keys.hope this help
