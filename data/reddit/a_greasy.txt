This is why it needs to be regulated...oh wait...you neck beards dont want that...
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:45:12
That's what regulation is called lol
@_date: 2018-03-08 11:44:29
Because he can. In an unregulated market, this situation will happen over and over again!
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:50:36
You know what the fucked part is? That this will keep happening as long as there is no regulation in the markets. 40% of bitcoin is owned by only 1000 people. 
Welcome to finance 101 neck beards. Market cornering/inside selling will happen in unregulated markets. You guys need regulation, yet, you say that goes against everything Bitcoin stands for. If you want your precious little tokens to satblize, then you NEED regulation.

The title to this post is so ignorant it's amazing.

you can ban people from using it for transactions, which renders it's value as 0.
Also governments can buy big lump sums and market corner it with a big sell off which would definitely impact it's value. The US is rumored to have a large supply of bitcoin.
Also they could just develop their own Crypto currency. It is supremely easy to clone or improve on bitcoin’s technology. What is not so easy is to duplicate bitcoin’s established lead in credibility and the large ecosystem of applications that have built up around it.
Essentially the only real value behind bitcoin is the blockchain. Everything else seems very pyramid scheme-ish to me.

If someone knew this guys wallet address, that would go against everything crypto stands for. No longer anonymous, you can simply hack the vlock chain by looking up historical transactions. People have already identified the guys wallet and transactions in other articles.

Govt could use anti–money laundering laws, etc., the entities that allow Bitcoin to interface with the "real" (non-Bitcoin) world. That is, USD–Bitcoin exchanges, people who have a real-world address to ship things from, stuff like that. You may not be able to attack the part of the Bitcoin system that lives entirely in the Internet, but you can cut off any appendages that reach into meatspace (to use a term that I really don't like).
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:48:50
Thing is, if govt. can't regulate it or keep track of it, they will ban it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:31:35
The market has changed for crypto currencies since those last crashes. Your argument is extremely flawed. Also never use history to predict market future. Your bitcoin will probably value correct itself around 8000. If countries decide to come out with their own crypto, it will fall even more. The more countries ban bitcoin, because they cannot track it, it will drop. The valuable part of Bitcoin is the Blockchain tech. and Blockchain tech is not Bitcoin. This is what people fail realize.

Governments will always want to know exactly what you are buying. That way they can tax you and make money so that they get paid and society actually runs somewhat smoothly. 
I think that's a fantasy remark to make. The government will always push to know where,why and how your money is being processed. That will never end. If they didn't they couldn't charge tax. If they don;t charge tax, we don't receive the societal benefits. Like garbage pick up.

No they are putting it in Bonds. Yields are at a 4 year high and are way less volatile. Crypto will suffer

Id be speculative. The fact that a minority of people hold the total amount of bitcoin is alarming. Insider trading, market cornering, and the strong crypto community is what drove the price up. Sure it ended up making people tons of money. But once more players enter the game, these trading techniques create imbalances of power and end up hurting the average trader. This fact is what will set alarm bells off in countries. The stories are already coming out of people losing everything due to the absolute crazy volatility that comes along with crypto trading and the recent price drops. Countries will have/want to stabilize this "wild west economy" to protect their populations, there is a reason these trading techniques are illegal in regular non crypto exchanges. 
Maybe to combat the issue countries will develope their own cryptos (Canada is looking into this) with blockchain technology. Maybe some countries will outright ban it because they cannot control it or record it for tax purposes and are losing out on money etc. Rumours are flying about korea russia and the uk deeming regulation necessary to prevent white collar crime. Theres just a lot more at risk now that crypto currencies are in the spotlight unlike last year. Countries are starting to notice and so is the average investor. This aint the same game as it was 2 years ago or even a year ago.

What's wrong about it?
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:55:04
It's value can go down to zero. That is not impossible. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:55:47
So if a country attaches it's own crypto coin to the blockchain, same thing?
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:00:18
They could ban coin exchanges

@_date: 2018-02-21 20:30:12
As more countries ban it (not saying they will, if they do), maybe substituting it for their own national crypto coins, what value does it have?
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:49:49
The guy should have a noose around his neck

probably so they can accept bitcoin legally as a payment.
