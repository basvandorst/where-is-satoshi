That's a good point and I agree.

1M dumped would probably reduce the exchange rate to between $10 and $50.
Do you mean a 1M dump would reduce the exchange rate to $100 - $500?
edit: wait never mind i just got it.

Hold the bitcoins for when the price goes up. Or if you don't want them, donate to a charity that takes bitcoin. Unless you were a co-signer for the account he is in debt with, you aren't liable. I assume that you weren't a co-signer since you say it's "his" debt. If you were a co-signer, than it certainly is your debt too, and so you should pay it. As for converting to fiat, coinbase.com is a good place to start.

My guess is that they would just close that person's account, or at least bar them from using a credit card again.

You could also use a reverse image search algorithm on submissions to see if a picture is already somewhere else on the web. IIRC, imgur does something like that.

You could just roll up a paper wallet.

Peer-to-peer/pool lending. [BTCjam](
As bitcoin adoption grows, so will crypto-lending. Lending on that site has already surpassed 27000 btc.

Seriously? Why the fuck would they do that?

You can lend/borrow locked into fiat or bitcoin. For example, if I want to borrow 1 BTC, I can choose a loan where I only have repay $510 worth of BTC (plus interest). Or I can choose a loan where I have to repay 1 BTC (plus interest), regardless of market price.

This might be a dumb question, but is it possible to do what you said with p2pool?

You're welcome!  Thanks for posting this. I had no idea we had a Bitcoin atm. I'll be making my way to Nu Yalk soon to get me a slice of bitcoin.

Use circle to buy some bitcoin,  then send them to your changetip wallet. Once you've bought bitcoin, open changetip and go to My Money. Select "Deposit Bitcoin directly to ChangeTip" and copy the address below the QR code. Then open Circle and go to "Send" and paste that address. Enter the amount you want to send and send it. Now your changetip wallet is filled up and you can start donating. If you want to cash out, just do the opposite and send bitcoin from changetip to circle, and then select "Withdraw" in circle to convert back to USD.
