Bitcoin crashed today. I'm worried that it might never go up again. I think I'm having a panic attack.

When bitcoin reaches $1M that 5 dollars ... it will be over $1000 !!

I think that whales will spread there vast wealth around within the bitcoin ecosystem to benefit the poor people, at least in those geographic areas where bitcoin is in control. Other areas of the world where fiat dominates will not be so lucky.

The raises are longs buying for sure. The crashes are most likely short selling or manipulation. Short sellers need to cover and manipulators will be brought to book. So the net effect will be to the moon eventually.

When one satoshi is worth 500 dollars he'll so much be sorry he did not take your advice !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm waiting for $2800. Then the shorts gonna get destroyed.

You cannot deny that the BTC price has gone up nearly 200% in last year. Tell me a stock which has done as well as that !
@_date: 2018-07-08 20:52:03
Yes OK. But you shouldn’t forget other cryptos, they might outperform Bitcoin.

No, I have another name also, from a few months ago. Somehow my ipad requested password, but I didn’t have it with my as was away from home where I have hardcopy so I decided to make another name. I think this is allowed.

Thanks. Tom gives an interesting talk. After 11min and 18min he indicates that if millennials go for blockchain, if they invest their big money in bitcoin then its value will appreciate enormously. But he is a wise man because he uses the word “if”. I’m sure that if he were in our conversation he would admit that he is hoping that he has made a good call, but it is so difficult to predict the future and he cannot be sure. Possibly millennials will take against cryptos for some reason, they may decide that they do not like what they see.  I’m waiting to see the adoption rate increase this surely is the evidence we need. I still think that it is a big problem that crypto derives value as an asset because if its perceived value as a currency but if people see it primarily as an asset it wont’ be used. This then will undermine the asset value.

According to the article this is not “most likely” in the sense that there is a high probably that Bitcoin will gain mass adoption. Rather it is that of all cryptos bitcoin is the one most likely to be mass adopted, completely different things. This probability of mass adoption could nevertheless be very very small. For mass adoption it is necessary that millions of new leeks buy more crypto and start to use it to buy breakfast cereal. When is this going to happen.
@_date: 2018-07-08 16:27:07
Is it a tool for harvesting leeks
@_date: 2018-07-08 17:44:48
I agree with your first paragraph. I do not have the full knowledge to comment on Monero. I guess some crypto enthusiasts would agree with you (Monero enthusiasts) but many would not. IMO the problem for mass adoption, as I alluded to, is that we have got to get the leeks to use crypto. But I guess they are buying it because somehow they think it is an investment that they can pass on to their children when they die. So they won’t spend the bitcoin so it won’t be adopted.

I’m thinking marijuana stocks are a better bet than cryptos actually.

Yes, how much do FUDders get paid for FuDding. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 23:34:38
Now might be a good time to buy because probably 4000 is the bottom
@_date: 2018-12-05 20:21:17
But what if they bought OTC for like 3000
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:48:29
Dead cat bounces can work in both directions !
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:44:20
Bcash is dragging bitcoin down with it, you can see them moving together
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:47:24
bitcoin is the future, once adoption takes off, BTC price will decrease because people won't buy it is a store of value any more, BTC will just circulate in the economy faster and faster and faster to fulfil people's needs.

Is it possible to write a letter to Santa Claus. Then I know that nobody can change it before Santa reads it.

I wouldn't go mad in the beginning, $5 sounds a lot, especially if you have to pay fees as well.
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:54:49
You did well if you bought it in the last 20 min. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:45:45
But if people can't afford bitcoin they can use fiat instead or Monero
