"There’s a lot of bluster around Bitcoin, because it’s such an easy way to get publicity thanks to media still in awe that real businesses take a made-up money."
There are a lot of bluster around everything nowadays. Newspapers write about everything...seems like they gone crazy. And titles are getting wild and wilder.

If we accept the fact that all the world currencies are overestimated, then we should recalculate the real price of them. After recalculation, i believe, the real value of the companies will cost much smaller.

How mining in small pools can be more profitable that in big pool??

Cmon folks - if we want bitcoin to get more exposure, we are going to have to pay these guys better.  .6 is not enough.  Please be a little more generous and send this guy a $10 at least to make it worth their while.  Then more guys will try.  Then more reporters will talk about it.  Then more people will understand bitocin.  Then your value will go up.  It is like paying yourself!!  Do it now.  Double down and send another payment to make up for your cheap ass first payment.

I tried both, mining in small and big one, but to my farm it's more profitable in big one.

Every capitalist system of economy tends to a monopoly. But with decreasing of mining sources the difficulty will decrease to, so it would be nonprofit to stop mining.
