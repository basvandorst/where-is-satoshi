You can tell how scared he is of being in that lake!

That's the catch with Robinhood, it's not actual BTC.  There is no wallet or a way to withdrawal BTC from RH.  It's essentially paper trading BTC.  You have to just sell your BTC on RH, take the cash and buy it on a real exchange like Coinbase or Cash App if you want to withdrawal the BTC to a hardware wallet.

"the bitcoin you’re “buying / selling” is likely not ever actually btc just fake numbers in a database"
You're implying they don't own the BTC just because they don't assign you a personal wallet id.  They're not trying to be in the custody business, they're in the sales business.  A company like Robinhood where you can't actually withdrawal your crypto isn't likely using real btc.  If I can withdrawal my BTC from the Cash App, it's most certainly real.

You don't get it. It's a fiat on ramp, you can absolutely send the BTC you buy on SQ's Cash App to your own private wallet.  If it was "just fake numbers in a database" you wouldn't be able to withdrawal it to your own private wallet.

Exactly, this guy saying 30-40 years sounds like the grandpa I never met and has no understanding of how fast these markets move.
@_date: 2019-11-10 23:55:30
Well don't worry man, it will certainly be there in 30-40 years lol.  More like 2 years.

With the year long domination of the bears, I'm pumped about more Bulls joining the fight.

Being in Florida, I can finally turn the A/C down in my spare room to stop my 6gpu's from overheating the space haha!

Well it only goes parabolic for a short time.  Was the 80% bear market correction that lasted a year not enough of a healthy dump in your opinion to weed out the moon boys?  For this asset to be taken seriously it need to be in the trillion dollar market cap area, not sitting at 150 billion.
@_date: 2019-03-15 23:57:51
Bull market confirmed!
@_date: 2019-11-10 16:29:05
Is this like... for real?

Jack is a believer.  I am too.
@_date: 2019-11-11 01:21:20
Are you familiar with the 4 year cycles?  Do you know the price of each bitcoin for BTC to reach a trillion dollar cap?  It's 55k, which is absolutely possible by the end of 2021.  LOL

I love BTC, but it's 2am my time and this isn't how real life transactions work.
@_date: 2019-06-29 13:40:36
I'd like to transact value with you now sir, but let's wait til it's 4am so we can transact cheaper.

Definitely have to disagree with this, Pomp spends his night and days pitching bitcoin to institutional investors.  Converting the normies essentially.
@_date: 2019-12-31 00:22:03
Well just take the 9 grand from the insurance company and buy a new car.  Why sell either?
@_date: 2019-04-14 17:05:54
Probably because he threatens to sue everyone like Craig Wright does.

Yes, Square Cash app is legit
@_date: 2018-11-30 20:10:39
You're right, it's called a market correction.  These cycles of growth and decline happen in every market.  Historically speaking, buying BTC after an 80% decline has been one of the best investments that could possibly be made.
@_date: 2018-07-31 15:16:06
Yes that would have been great, unfortunately we lost 7800 support though.  I'm thinking we head down to 7200-7400 range and that's where the bulls need to show up in a big way.
@_date: 2018-07-31 15:22:16
If you're in to TA, we just lost the daily higher low pattern and set this lower low of 7667.  I think we're more likely to set a lower high and then head towards $7200-$7400 range.

NVDA just dropped 50% and people are buying the dip.
@_date: 2018-12-28 20:35:55
Basically means Time hasn’t written about Bitcoin since like 2 years ago haha. 
@_date: 2019-05-16 14:00:28
Shocked this is being asked.  This would enable internet access to those that don't currently have it.  In places like Venezuela where their dictator can just turn off the internet on a whim, no more.
