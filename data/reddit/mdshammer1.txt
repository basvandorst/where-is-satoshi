Sounds legit
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:24:29
It will get past it... just testing the waters

I like the way you think
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:25:49
It's happening

Found this online maybe it will help? "its value is determined by perception. Instead of the trust of some government entity being evaluated to determine the value of Bitcoin, other factors (the technology, widespread acceptance, understanding of e-money, etc.) are taken into consideration. When magazines and online entities write intriguing articles about Bitcoin, people take interest in it, the demand goes up and so does its value "

They have not moved almost identical from what I've seen.

The new golden age is about to be upon us
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:24:36
12k incoming!!
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:44:38
I watched a few of his videos earlier today.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:24:29
Look at history of them.may be similar movement...but this is exact. If you overlap them it's like 95% the same
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:12:15
Why would all three coins move exactly the same way? Weird 
Edit: look at 11/29
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:17:55
Why do all three coins(btc, LTC, ethereum ) have the exact same movement on 11/29? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:45:59
11k by the end of the week
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:53:22
What you are saying makes absolutely no sense. If what you said was true, you would see over the long trend similar outcome. You do not. Furthermore you would see Bitcoin going down litecoin going up. You should do more research on how markets work. They are separate assets. When the dollar bill goes down you don't see stock prices all have the same dip that the dollar bill moved.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:22:50
Very weird!
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:25:50
That's what I'm saying. Markets don't do this. They may have a strong link to another but not exactly linked like the movement shows.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:04:29
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:54:52
Can confirm this! Just thought it would be quick to see it in my wallet it's been 2 days.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:05:27
Bitcoin never stops...it may hit walls but it climbs that shit
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:57:49
Totally got it..whew. I was trying to get my funds off coinbase so I could secure them. I'm new so I wish I would of done this earlier it cost 3 bucks to do it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:26:13
Man I made a boo boo...I sent my bitcoins from coinbase to the wrong email...lucky I could create an account with that email. Ugh I have to wait 30 days now.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:43:22
It didn't rebound. But I created a coinbase account with the email. I can't get he verification email to come through tho. So I'm safe on that end...I have to likely waait 30 days to get it back.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:01:28
If tomorrow is 11k what is the end of the week 20k?
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:31:24
Can someone please explain the sell wall countdown? Basically people set up a stop and those many transactions must go through before it can bust the 10k mark?
