Nobody wants to pay taxes. But you apparently enjoy living in the U.S., by which the quality of life is paid for by taxes, including capital gains. If you don't want to live here and pay the "rent", you can always move somewhere else that doesn't require such tax obligation, just be prepared to deal with roving gangs of warlords and periodic blackouts. The choice is yours to either move, to pay or not pay taxes; just be prepared for the consequences of your decisions.

Do you live in the real world? There are layers of consumer protection that protect my money much more reliably than anything bitcoin has. Has everyone forgotten Mt. Gox? Or are you all just so jacked up on bitcoin that you ignore the massive theft that went on? I will not hear one day that Wells Fargo lost all of my money, and I'm fucked. If someone scams me, or I don't receive the goods or services I pay for, I can stop payment. Banks have consumer protections that bitcoin doesn't.

And that's why the clever people here see your post as nothing more than flamboyant rhetoric designed to allay the fears of a panicked market. You're a speculator, and there is nothing a speculator despises more than "regulation". You believe in bitcoin to the extent it puts money in your pocket while selling the dream of a free currency to naive ideologues. 
I'm sure you're not dumb enough to believe that an unregulated currency is feasible, yet you continue to maintain that this is an "economic revolution" for the purpose of pumping the price of bitcoin for your own selfish designs. You never saw bitcoins, you saw dollar signs. You capitalized on people's false hope and greed. It doesn't take a cryptographer to decipher the fact that you're nothing more than a con-artist.

Time is not a variable in this comparison. I am comparing bitcoin to fiat **now**, at this moment. I am eliminating the time component, because for the purposes of this comparison what banks were doing 5 years after they were created (however you would get data for that, lol) is irrelevant. 
A "proper" comparison does not require time be a variable in the decision unless the comparison directly calls for it. When you have to choose between a set of tires made by different manufacturers, do you deem the comparison impossible because one tire company has been making tires since 1935 and the other since 1940? No, you make your decision based on which tire performs the duties of being a tire best. When the company was founded is irrelevant. Time is only a variable in a comparison when time is relevant. You want to use time to handicap bitcoin, your argument being it's "still growing". That may or may not be true, but in this case of which currency is easier for the public to use at this moment, the answer is clear.

The point you should be taking away from this is that bitcoin is "dead" for them, not for you. It means investor confidence has been diminished. The Bitcoin brand has lost credibility and when laymen think of bitcoin, they'll think of this incident. This is now a part of bitcoin history.

You have a very naive and conspiratorial attitude which undoubtedly stems from your ignorance. The SEC can't enforce laws that don't exist, but the laws that do exist are enforced. Ask Bernie Madoff. 
There is probably crime in the financial industry, but that doesn't mean we should get rid of the regulations. That would just make the crime legal.

You have some major problems with your list of benefits.


I'll just assume you might be correct here, but given the fact you're wrong on every other point, who really knows. I've never made a bitcoin transaction.


Which means it's unregulated, not backed by anything, and subject to tremendous fluctuation which means it could be worth much less in four hours than it was a minute ago. 


But is heavily vulnerable to deflation as a result of it being unregulated and finite, which is just as bad for the economy and the consumer. If nobody can get their hands on a bitcoin for transaction purposes because they are being hoarded due to scarcity, a population will necessarily be forced to use another method of transaction (dollars, pesos, chickens, etc.).   


Bitcoin is not accessible. Somebody here tipped me .001 bitcoins a month or two ago. I have no idea how to retrieve it, or even if I really "own" it. A farmer in zimbabwe can be given a credit card and use it in town the next day. To use bitcoin I need:
A computer
Internet access (Most of the world still does not have access to the internet.)
A bank account (go banks!)
The willingness to deal with fringe "exchanges" whose legality is still in question.
I also need the person I am making the transaction with to have access to all of the above.


And extremely deleterious to consumers making them extremely vulnerable to all manner of fraud. 


Totally secure until you lose your paper wallet, your hard drive crashes, or somebody gets %51 of a mining group, or cons you out of it.
At this point cash is just as beneficial as bitcoin. It carries the same risks with regard to security, but is much more liquid (which is why you see huge value drops in sell offs in bitcoin) and just as fungible.

The only problem is that if a person is going to accept bitcoin, if they're smart they'll want to know exactly what it is in plain english. Everytime I ask what Bitcoin is, I get some jargon about block chains or something. To understand bitcoin you basically have to sit down and research it, and it's a hassle. At that point it becomes easier to just use dollar bills, or any other established currency, especially considering that the "benefits" of bitcoin really aren't that spectacular. But you can transfer money anywhere! So what. I can do that anyway and with much less risk of being defrauded. Bitcoin is not for everyone, and that is what will stop it from taking hold. It's a novelty, and something for players like the winklevii to speculate on.

How do we know this guy even lost money? He could be lying. He could have been one of the people who dumped his BTC before the lock out and now he's trying to pump the price again by saying "it's not over, buy!" Voorhees is full of it and if you trust this guy it's your own fault for being conned. Gox is just the beginning. Every bubble collapses, every pyramid crumbles. The reason we regulate securities is to prevent things like this. 
Every argument against regulation hinges on the premise that regulation is ineffective because fraud still exists. As Mr. Voorhees stated about the nature of man in his original post, men will be evil, so there will always be fraud. But like the civil laws which govern our societies, regulations, which are only laws by another name, seek to curtail the extent of man's evil. To suggest that regulations are unnecessary is to suggest that laws are unnecessary, which only a man intent on the evils described in his post would suggest. Good men want just laws, because just laws punish the commission of "evil" acts. 
Without law we are in a state of nature where justice cannot exist. Anarchists will claim that they will all follow a natural order, but who enforces this natural order? And by what means does he enforce it? An anarchist will tell you that in a anarchist society he will venture off into the woods, claim a plot of land and farm or be productive in other ways, but if not by law how can he claim his property? What claim does he have over the means of his production other that his individual will? He has created a law unto himself, which is only as strong as the will of the individual. This inevitably leads to conflict as men attempt to assert their will and their law over others. 
To avoid this conflict, professed anarchists start establishing committees to establish property rights and laws against theft and murder. Without fail they create a government all their own and it begins to look similar to the governments that have come before. Order and law is necessary for society to advance. 
This is why anarchy is a childish notion, and ultimately why bitcoin cannot achieve what it is setting out to achieve. What anarchists really want is a level playing field. An untouched Eden with no established order, allowing them to be their own economic and societal masters. Bitcoin promised that. But as Mr. Voorhees stated, there will be evil men, and evil men have taken their share. Are you going to continue to play by these despots' rules, or will you have faith and trust in the laws of the United States, even if imperfect? At least with our government there is a democratic mechanism to promote the public good. 
Our democracy at its core is an attempt at fairness, that took millennia to get to the state it is in today. There are well-reasoned, rational explanations for all of our fundamental laws. Anarchists and Libertarians are either ignorant of or choose to ignore the history of truly brilliant thought that has shaped our society. This is why bitcoin can't succeed in it's mission, however seemingly noble. It is an old idea dressed in 21st century technology. A lawless economic frontier. Enjoy it while it lasts. Make some money if you can, but don't be left holding the bag.

So your argument is that there isn't enough regulation? We need to strengthen the SEC? Your logic contradicts itself. You apparently haven't thought this through.
@_date: 2014-10-23 18:09:22
The lack of security in apparently secure places to keep your bitcoin is the problem and why it will never replace "fiat" currency. You can never really lose fiat unless you are carrying around fiat. It's tracked, it's insured, and the fees associated with it's movement are a small price to pay for peace of mind. 
If you're worried about inflation, that's understandable. But there are other "inflation proof" investments you can make that are much less volatile and more secure than buying bitcoin. 
I've known of bitcoin since 2009. I've read the white paper. I'm pretty sure I own bitcoin through someone who bitcoin tipped me on this website. I still have pretty much no idea how to access my bitcoins, the precise way in which bitcoin works, how to store them safely, how to trade them, or spend them. The mysterious crypto-veil which surrounds bitcoin and insures it's value doesn't help consumer confidence who want transparency in the things in which they invest. 
I'm a layman. You may scoff at that, but I'm representative of the type of person you want to adopt bitcoin. There are legitimate concerns to the average person's apprehension of investment in bitcoin, much less the total adoption over fiat. Bitcoin is exciting and interesting, but it's very hard to see the fulfillment of it's mission as stated. The best I can see is it being traded as a commodity, and the most public face of bitcoin, the Winklevii, apparently conform to this opinion with the creation of the speculative [Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust]( which do not value their stock in Bitcoin, but in fiat. 
In my opinion, bitcoin is an apocalypse currency. It's championed by people who fear economic/governmental/societal collapse or crises, in which case bitcoin, like gold, will have (possibly) kept its value, assuming that the lights are still on at these bitcoin exchanges, which is a gamble in itself. 
I could be wrong, of course, but this is the way I see it. I think that not being invested in bitcoin allows me to look at it objectively rather than having to bias my opinion. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:59:30

@_date: 2015-01-12 01:09:57
The simple reason Bitcoin is falling is because the economy is doing better. The price of Bitcoin has always been a bit of a fear index, along with gold. People don't need a post-economic collapse commodity if it appears that the economic collapse isn't coming anytime soon. It also never quite took hold with the general population after the 2013 boom of interest which drove the price over $1000 USD. 
Now that "everyone" has heard of bitcoin, I think the heavy boom/bust cycle will be mellowed, and it will probably experience slow, steady growth over the years, which might actually be better for the long term goal of bitcoin as a currency instead of a speculative commodity.

There are a million problems with bitcoin right now. Any currency which requires some kind of intermediate technical knowledge to use is too advanced for the average person. Bitcoin needs to overcome these hurdles to its ease of use to become a true currency. Right now it's just a commodity that is being highly speculated on. 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it illegal to trade bitcoin due to its lack of regulation by the SEC? Trading unregulated commodities is a crime. How is bitcoin dealing with this? 
Reasonable people should know that investing in bitcoin is a tremendous risk, regardless of your pie-in-the-sky outlook on it. It is not, despite everyone on this subs conviction, a sure thing. This is shown by the fact that the global financial power players have not decided to invest heavily in it. If you think that is because they aren't "smart" enough to know bitcoin is a hit, you are seriously deluded. 
If you have bitcoin, you should probably hold them for now, buying is too risky considering we are at the highest price ever. But hey, if you do take the risk and it turns out well, good for you. But understand that this isn't printing money.

The United States government will never allow any "currency" to undermine the power of the federal reserve bank. Furthermore, bitcoin will never gain mass appeal without transparency, which is seemingly impossible due to it's mysterious nature as a crypto-currency. Who the fuck is satoshi? And do we really want to wrap up trillions of dollars; national economies based on something so obfuscated?  If you haven't identified and considered these major problems or willingly turn a blind eye to them, I have to say I don't think you're smart or mature enough to be dabbling in financial investment of any kind, much less something as volatile as bitcoin.

This whole thing just reminds me of a Ponzi scheme. Believe me, someone is going to be left holding the bag eventually.
Because it is not a officially sanctioned currency, it has no protection under the law. Therefore it can be seized or outlawed by any legitimate government, especially if it is targeted as a black market currency, 
A bitcoin will never be worth 20,000 dollars or anything near that. You think governments will allow people to hide currency in untraceable commodities? If it gets too big and endangers the powers that be, those powers will shut it down. 
If bitcoins are so profitable, why hasn't microsoft, or any other company for that matter, created a subdivision of bitcoin mining? Why haven't governments invested tax revenue into bitcoin? Believe that you are not that smart. If you just "discovered" something on reddit (lol), the secret is already out and people knew about it long before you and either have done it to the point where you are excluded, or have determined it is a scam for retards.
If you want to play around with a few thousand dollars, you might make a few thousand dollars on this scam, but the people who are going "long term investment" are going to end up with empty pockets. 
I will admit it is an interesting concept. Bitcoins are so volatile that even this post might trigger a change in the price if it leads to a buy or sell. I might buy one if I feel like gambling, but to make a real investment in these things is way too risky. 
**Okay did some research, things are getting interesting. I might be totally wrong.

Whenever I read a comment I agree with, it's always you. That's what Peter said in the interview. Some people are going to make alot of money, but most people are going to lose a lot of money. It's a bubble. It will not become an accepted global currency. That's what he said, and all of those things are likely.
I just love how a bunch of nobodies on reddit are so arrogant to call a guy who has been extremely successful in the financial industry for 30 years an "idiot" when he gives his opinion on bitcoin.

Until one day you realize that was a $300 subway sandwich. Which is exactly why this isn't a good currency. If a currency fluctuates in price 200% over three days it isn't stable enough to be used for valuating goods and services. Bitcoin is for gambling.

You say 1 bitcoin will be worth 20 grand, is it possible to sell pieces of bitcoin? At 20k a pop, its hard to make it liquid and tradable. Cashing out would be reliant on exchanging it for hard currency. I don't think you can buy a house with bitcoins.

I think it's more that nobody really knows exactly what bitcoin is. It is possible to explain fairly complex financial systems in clear and logical terms. I haven't heard a concise explanation of bitcoin yet. Maybe it's because of the added hurdle of having to understand the technology behind it. It's either overly technical in its description, meaning there is a knowledge barrier to comprehending it (which works against it as a currency), or it's so vague as to not communicate anything substantial. 
When you say:


It's vague because there are question that aren't answered. Who pays them the fee? Is the fee paid in bitcoin? It has nothing to do with being an "egghead".

The point remains that bitcoin will never be anything more than a digital commodity to gambled on, or at best a black market currency. Will the U.S. government ever allow people to pay taxes in bitcoin? Will it ever pay its employees in bitcoin? Of course not, and the reason why is the reason why bitcoin will never be more than what it is currently.

I didn't say gold wasn't used as a currency, I said gold wasn't used commonly as currency, and it wasn't - it was too valuable. Apparently you need to work on your reading comprehension. Gold has mainly been used as a way to preserve wealth as a non-perishable good. Thinking that people carried around the equivalent of $1,000 bills is pure ignorance. 




For large scale transactions. It was not common for someone to pay for their daily bread with florins.  


The only thing you're serving is ignorance. Sorry to burst your little hype bubble. Why do you think the Winklevosses are on CNBC hyping bitcoin? Because they invested 11 million dollars in it. Its the same reason this sub is filled with "good news" about bitcoin, its the same reason why you can tip people bitcoin on this sub. And its the same reason why you won't consider for a moment that bitcoin could fail: because you're invested in it, and it's a hype based commodity with zero actual value other than what people are willing to perceive it is worth. If anyone ever actually realizes that the emperor has no clothes, you better hope you've cashed out of this little social experiment. And you say I'm spreading lies? It's laughable that you would even suggest that when the entire value of bitcoin is based on pure speculation. 
If Paul Krugman is such an amateur, why don't you take his job? Why don't you work on wallstreet and start bringing home million dollar bonuses if you're such a financial wizard? Why fuck around with bitcoin when you could be raking in millions a year in the financial sector? Why? Because you're full of shit and have no idea what you're talking about. 
Get real, chump.

I think he is actually correct here:
*[...]this nonplace lures us to surrender our time on earth. A poor substitute it is, this virtual reality where frustration is legion and where–in the holy names of Education and Progress–important aspects of human interactions are relentlessly devalued.*
It is a poor substitute for real human interaction. Progress might not be devalued, but the value of education has been hacked at by wiki-scholars, internet wisemen, and IT nerds to the point that a university is now seen as little more than a overpriced trade school rather than a place of learning. Ask anyone on the internet if they think a liberal arts degree is "worth it", when the liberal arts and humanities were considered important enough to the greeks (the ones who invented philosophy, literally the love of knowledge and arguably the first step toward the acquisition of any knowledge or wisdom) for them to make it a mandatory part of a scholar's education.

It really wasn't used as currency often. Much more common throughout history was barter, or at the most copper or silver currencies. Gold was far too valuable to treated as a liquid asset. Nobody walked around with bags of gold on their way to the market. 
So, despite your snarky, condescending reply, gold was "almost never" used in commerce.

Until bitcoin is regulated, it is essentially a black market item. It can be seized at will by anyone with the authority to do so. It undercuts national currencies and devalues them. Do you really think the Federal Reserve is going to allow an unregulated currency to be transacted in the U.S.? Not to mention its problems with security.

It's nice to see someone sensible is this sub. To think that the U.S. would just relinquish their hold on global finance is a libertarian's wet dream, which makes it even less likely that it will happen. 
The more scrutiny bitcoin comes under, the more likely the bubble will burst. It just doesn't hold up to serious scrutiny. The winklevosses are gambling. The only difference is that you have 40k and they have 11 million to speculate with. It's all relative. Why did they need to go on CNBC and talk about their investment? Are they bitcoin manufacturers? Are they the CEO of bitcoin? No, they went on TV to hype up the commodity that is based on hype so they can turn their 11 million into 40 and sell. It's going to be people like the people in this sub who will be left with empty pockets as they try to stoke the embers of their dying anarchist utopia. 
It's actually a sad commentary on the state of the american economy. The Gold Rush of 2013. If this is a scam, it is brilliant. It's a perfect mix of greed and cognitive dissonance. It's the hope of the american dream reborn. All you have to do it "ACT NOW" and you too can be rich beyond your wildest dreams, just like those guys on wall street! This might end up being a really sad story.

I don't think this is true. If all value were subjective I could assert that gold is not valuable as a subjective claim, however, gold would still be valuable. Therefore the value of gold is not subjective, but tied to its objectively valuable qualities which you mentioned yourself.


Also, non-perishable. These are intrinsic qualities which provide objective utility and therefore value within an economic system. Bitcoin also has intrinsic value based upon its utility.
