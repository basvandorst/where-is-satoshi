True that. Our community is small, but it gets bigger everyday. Sure, the mainstream media is not helping the growth. But the adoption has already started to loom in the background of all this drama. And that's a huge thing!

True that. You are absolutely right.

I'd just quote Andreas' description of a part of a talk which took place on December 6th, 2016:
"Is Segregated Witness necessary for the Lightning Network? Yes. The Lightning Network can be implemented at this time but the result would be less efficient without SegWit. It is a pre-requisite for a lot of things."

Here. 
I wrote this for you! =)

Exactly! That's why I made it!
But nope... "flips the middle finger out"...
It's BITCOIN CASH!!!!

But the main "reason" for the chain split was the Segwit activation, wasn't it? Because Segwit was not the true Satoshi vision of scaling. If BCH activates Segwit after the so called "death" of BTC, it would seem like a very dick move, don't you think?

1. I agree. I'm not the most creditable source of info. But well, you got the point, which is ok.
2. Currently, as of yet, the argument really stands that way. I'm sure, however, that there are other technologies being developed (if not already) for scaling Bitcoin as a protocol. But as of yet, the solution is ether on-chain (increasing the blocksize is one of the easiest) or off-chain (Segwit+LN+whatever they come up with as we move further).


It will result in 8x the capacity. Even if we move to 64x blocks, that would be way faster. But it will hurt the decentralisation of full-nodes long term.

Ok. I agree to disagree. =)
Merry Christmas, by the way!

Unfortunately, you are wrong here.
Currently, there is only one solution and that’s why BCH is a winner (short term, that is). That is the increased size of blocks. The capacity of BCH increases, the more TXs fit in the block, yata-yata-yata. Yep. All is good. Now let’s see the volume of TXs. Currently, it’s nothing compared to BTC.
There are only two possible solutions currently to scaling:
A) to increase the block sizes even further (let’s call it BCH-way).
B) to implement the off-chain tech, like Segwit+LN (let’s call it BTC-way).
**Pros of BCH-way:**
You get the more TXs to fit in one block (short term - good, long term - not so great).
**Cons of BCH-way:**
While getting the more faster and “more reliable” coin, it gets harder and harder for people to run a full node. If we extrapolate it to the mainstream adoption like-VISA levels, it’s **not** a good solution.
**Here is why:**
Let’s compare VISA (which is scalable to 60 000 TXs per second), to BTC’s current 7 TXs/sec (1 MB block) to BCH’s 56 TXs/sec (8 MB block).
If we go to the BCH-route to reach the VISA levels we need a whopping 8517 MB per block (60000/7). That’s an eight and a half GIGS of storage being eaten out every 10 MINUTES.
Therefore, users who need to run a full node (small merchants, small miners and blockchain enthusiasts) won’t be able to do it (for the reasons not only the cost of storage, but broadband cost, because remember, you need to download **8+ GIGS every TEN muintes**). This makes it essentially impossible to run the full-node… And for doing that you have to rely on the third party (probably, **a big mining datacenter/corporation** that is capable to run a broadband connection and to be able to afford an infinite amount of storage capacity).
Therefore, BCH-way is the route to THE CENTRALIZATION not only for mining, but also for running a full node.
Is this possible? Yes. Sure. Why not? And, hell, it will happen in case of Visa-like adoption of BCH.
Why do you think Mr. Craig posted this on Twitter?
“Users did not need to run full nodes (i.e. mining) and that was never the aim. Users have SPV.”
**Now, let’s see and analyse the BTC-way.**
Segwit+LN makes a TXs go off-chain. Therefore, making it possible to transact without the need of putting every single TX on the blockchain. Therefore, by utilising this tech, we make a huge possibility to transact in very fast, very secure, very “private” fashion.
If ya’ll interested, here are good videos on the subject of LN:
Bitcoin Q&amp;A: The Lightning Network
Bitcoin's Lightning Network, Simply Explained!
We need to reach the Segwit adoption first, because it’s necessary for the LN to function.
Explained here:
Bitcoin Q&amp;A: Does Lightning need SegWit?
And LN should be put on the Main net and be stable.
Both of those **can take a LITTLE-BIG WHILE**. But in the end, we should reach the almost VISA-like scalability without affecting the block sizes (therefore, making it more decentralised in a way that anyone in the world can mine it, given that the entity has the equipment to do it, and run a full node.
Hope my explanation helps.
