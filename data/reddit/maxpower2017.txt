Legend, thanks!

LN is not being delivered by a central entity, hence no “official statement”. It’s open source. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:13:52
Yeah they are; check out Elizabeth Stark from Lightning labs on twitter

Where abouts is it in Surry Hills? Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:45:58
Thanks! I’ll check it out.

I guess when I read that question asked by others, I didn’t have a proper response to it, so I just wanted to educate myself. 
My question then becomes - why does someone knowledgeable like Erik Voorhees, keep suggesting it?
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:50:31
Cheers. Do you have any links or sources that go into detail about UTXO consolidation? Basically what is it, why it reduces fees and why exchanges don’t do this already?
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:05:10
Ok sure, but unless they are holding all their coins in an exchange, which is crazy esp for Venezuela, sending their coins to an exchange would also require a transaction. 
Also I heard that a lot of them are buying on localbitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:18:46
I don’t think that’s really a choice. We have to be realistic and understand that the vast majority of future users of the network will not be nodes. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:17:43
Yes you are absolutely correct. Segwit was a soft fork, whereas increasing the block size would need to be a hard fork. 
I guess my question is - why don’t we just hard fork it once to increase the block size, and buy us some time until proper scaling solutions are ready. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:56:57
You’re right - but what will we do once we hardfork to 8 or 10mbs and roger&amp;co just spam the network up to fill those blocks in the next few months?
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:25:25
That’s a pretty good analogy that I’ve never thought about. 
But are there any technical issues with this?
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:06:05
Never thought about this. Is this a thing? What’s to stop me from giving you my private key but having a secret backup at home?
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:00:20
Thanks! Great point. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:35:02
Yeah I absolutely agree and see that - but that really starts being an issue once you get over maybe 10-20mb blocks. 
What I’m saying is why don’t we increase the block size 1 off, reduce the tx fees and buy some time for LN.

I think that happens with any network. You can’t expect (in practice) to have every person using the network to also be a full node. 
People who send emails from their iPhone don’t have the knowledge to set up their own email server. And nor should they. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:54:06
Good idea!
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:30:27
What would be an analogous example of another system that is purely p2p?
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:07:54
Yeah the fees can vary widely depending on how you set up. Also - you may be located in the Euro time zone so when you are transacting the network is not as busy as in Asia or the US. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:37:31
Yes of course it’s not a centralized system. You were saying that any users who wanted to use bitcoin, had to also be full nodes. 
I told you that it would never happen in practice. 
You disagreed, and gave BitTorrent as an example where it happens. 
Well it doesn’t happen in BitTorrent - 80-90% of users just download a file and switch off their client, perhaps seeding about 5% of the file during the download process. 
It’s only the seeders (the full nodes in our example) that basically provide throughput to the system. 
In a similar way, full nodes will secure the system for the millions of users of bitcoin (analogous to peers in out BitTorrent example). 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:22:38
Appreciate the response. To answer your question - I do not run a node. Why? Perhaps I do not consider myself technical enough to do it.
I get everything you are saying. The way you explained it makes more and more sense than to simply say “it’s too hard”. Cheers!
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:36:31
Thanks for the reply. What’s a tab?
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:03:34
Fair point, but I’ve also heard stories of them actually using it to purchase food, medicine, etc on Amazon gift cards using bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:27:31
Thanks for the reply. But are there any technical issues with doing this? Does this open up any vulnerabilities or anything?
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:33:47
I respectfully disagree. In the best case BitTorrent is about 10-20% seeds, with about 1-5% of seeds contributing the majority of bandwidth to the network. 
It’s the usual 80/20 of any network system. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:26:43
You can just say that you don’t know...
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:19:36
Brilliant! I follow both on twitter but must have missed these. Thanks!!
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:22:05
I think you completely misunderstood me, and evidently I misunderstood you. We are actually in agreement then. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:20:18
Yeah this is probably the strongest argument, thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:52:20
Thanks for that reply! I actually agree with your every word. I guess I was just wondering why we can not take a “bandaid” approach to temporarily reduce the fees, before LN is ready. 
But other in the comments explained to me that it’s a technical nightmare to do and is rife with potential problems. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:37:52
That’s interesting, do you have any sources or articles that I can read up for more info?
