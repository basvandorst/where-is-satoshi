Its important to gatekeep. I care more about being an "earlier adopter" than seeing massive adoption. I don't care how toxic or viotriolic the bitcoin community gets so long as people know I was here before the normies.

why buy bitcoin when you can buy bitcoin mining on Genesis? 
@_date: 2015-08-22 20:48:57
Okay, I am thinking 100-200 dollars to bitcoins a month to get started. You're right though emotional buying can be bad. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 16:16:40
I hear you, but bitcoins at the moment are just barely above a two year low, now would be the time to buy. If only I had money to spend this month 
@_date: 2015-08-22 21:44:57
In 2001 Microsoft was at an all time and then dropped sharply in 2002 and 2003 is microsoft not a strong company. It's called a bubble and most industries including IT and real state have them. Pretty much any market with equity will experience highs and troughs. But bitcoin is not as volatile as many people believe it has only gone down 20 dollars in two weeks time compared to 250 thats a volatility of 12.5%.
@_date: 2015-08-22 20:56:20
I thought the price might dip around December or into next year because of panic surround bitchain limits and a possible forking. Do you thinking forking and panic around that will cause a down trend?
@_date: 2015-08-31 13:31:53
you do realize mathamatically it takes like 18 months to break even in many cases. If you made 21 dollars in 3 and a half months. 21/3.5 thats 6 dollars a month, so it would take 20 months to break even and then it is all ROI after that. So does that make it sound less shitty or are you that impatient? 
@_date: 2015-08-31 18:13:52
I am going by what they say is the daily average which is about .33 USD, so 187 dollars would be 566 days or roughly a year and a half. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 20:46:52
so you think it will stay up at 225-230 range for the next few months? 
@_date: 2015-08-22 20:55:18
I am not using HODL, I plan on buying bitcoins for cloud mining on Zeus Hash. But people keep saying that is a ponzi scheme, despite having read 4 or 5 different websites giving it solid reviews like 4 out of 5 and 4 1/2 out of 5 star ratings. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 00:11:23
If it is a scam lets say, and I had an eobot account. What are the odds of me seeing any money out of it, or am I basically fucked? Also is Genesis and Zeushash also a scam, these sites look pretty legit, and have good reviews on multiple websites, it almost seems like miners just scream "scam" "ponzi scheme" without even thinking about what the individual company is.

@_date: 2015-08-31 01:27:39
I have an eobot account and I have calculated it out to be around 18 months to break even, on a 5 year contract. Unless there is no exit strategy and it really is a scam there will be ROI. Just not till month 19 onward.

Is now a good time to cash out or should I keep holding. I am inundated with info which is really concerning meaning. And at the same time I am hearing people on youtube saying bitcoin will reach 10k in 2-5 years.

I live in New England. There is a homeless shelter in town. I can stay there up to 3 months and I can free meals three times a day ( and I have ebt). I would have everything I need except wifi. But if I get a library card which I plan on doing today I can use the librarys wifi to check email,reddit,facebook w/e. Basically I am wondering if anyone on bitcoin has had any experience with homeless shelter and what its like. Maybe there is a better subreddit to ask. I told my dad this the other day. "I feel like bitcoin is the fucking apple company in the 80s and I've bought stock in the 80s in apple and want to hold it for 20-25 years to see where it goes."

either a drug dealer from silk road or other such site or child porn peddler. Either way you are a dispicable human being, I hope the FBI tracks you down and your coin stack gets stolen. Bitcoin needs to shed the image of criminality if it is to progress as a legit currency used in every day commercial activities, drug dealers and other illegal venders may have given it rise but we no longer want your kind. Stay on the deepweb and or leave reddit, that is unless you are full of shit, in which case stop shit-posting

Good point. Bitcoin is not a necessary commodity the same way oil is. Bitcoin demand may not stay the same, it could drop. Or it could stay constant. However if it stays constant who is to say it won't rise in price.

I think you and other people commenting are missing my point. Or perhaps I did not explain myself very well. Lets assume the following. At some point 21 million bitcoins will exist, (not all of them will be on the "market", because of obvious factors). But if you can divide even a single bitcoin into an infintesimally small fraction of it, than isn't this notion that it is a "scarce commodity" sort of not true.
@_date: 2017-05-04 01:52:35
I get it you. This may sound stupid, but bitcoin gave me a reason to wake up in the morning. I enjoyed the gainz, hell I even liked the lows and the dips. I just wonder how many people have regretted selling prematurely and I also wonder what the consensus is on alt-coins. If people diversify the way you might diversify a stock portfolio

I wrote this post in a rush. Its actually more like every 5 days I receive .0017 btc. So its its 1 year and 7 months which is 83 weeks. So (83*7)/5 which is 116.2 so 116 payments which is .197 btc, which today is worth 562.99 dollars. So actually yeah I broke even a while ago. Im not sure what point I am trying to say other than that had I bought 200 worth of bitcoin instead of paying 200 for x hash rate service ad infitium or until the site crashes, the company goes belly up, w/e, . So yeah bitcoin was 390-395 ish at the current time so 200/395 would actually be .506 btc which today is worth 1,422. So yeah 1,422 now or 562.99 over time gaining 2.85$ every 5 days.

"People all over the world can buy, own, and transact in Bitcoin.  There are now 7.3 billion people on the planet, so if all 21 million Bitcoin were distributed evenly to every person on the planet, each person would have only .0028767 of one bitcoin!"

you have been smoking too much hopium. I hope you are right because I own a small amount of btc and eth, but I have my doubts

I got the same email. FUCK ETH

Yeah. You are probably right, but its really easy to play what if scenarios, especially with bitcoin. I mean I do that shit like 90% of my waking life. Its a really unhealthy obsession.
