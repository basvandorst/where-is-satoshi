Ah I see, makes sense. The people offering the contract would continuously lose out through market manipulation and would just stop offering the contracts? So, as you say, it will should even itself out.
Another question then. Why are people so worried about market manipulation due to contracts?

Ok so if a whale has gone big on bitcoin recently and the price has artificially spiked we wouldn't necessarily see a sell off until closer to 6 months when the futures contract runs out? But with everyone other than wales and some panic sellers hodling price probably wouldn't drop down to below what it was a couple of months ago?
Also, I've read that these futures are only going to be offered to a small number of clients, wouldn't it look suspicious if they all tried to short bitcoin? Wouldn't some want to go long and others short meaning again, this sort of manipulation could even itself out?

I tried to sign up for them. They took pics of my passport but still decided not to allow me to have an account. No explanation. I did the exact same thing with Coinbase and they accepted me no problems.
I've read so many shit things about sending money to etoro. you should see their trustpilot page...  haven't found a crypto exchange that doesn't have majority good reviews yet.
Who do you use?

I've read loads about them holding on to deposits and transfers etc. basically taking peoples money.
I actually opened a Fidor account to reduce SEPA fees to coinbase/gdax but didn't realise until afterwards that they dont accept incoming SEPA transfers.
Have you had any issues taking money out of revolut? Whats you experience with them?
