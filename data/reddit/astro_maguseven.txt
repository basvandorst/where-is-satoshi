What do you do when bitcoin never puts in an uptrend? What about the opportunity cost of having your cash tied up in something that is trending down? I believe in bitcoin long term but I don't want to gamble on it

Clearly the hopium in this sub is a little bit too strong for my taste. I'll stick to my trading strategy as it has shown to work over time, but thanks for your input!

From a technical perspective, I would want to see bitcoin in a clear objective uptrend before putting my money in. While I am a believer in long term bitcoin, this bear market will probably play out longer than most people are anticipating. Trying to buy the very bottom of a market cycle is risky and the opportunity cost is too high when there are many other opportunities in other markets to make money
and shorting bitcoin is a pretty risky business especially after it has moved this low, the risk:reward ratio is no longer very attractive for shorting bitcoin unless it break down into new lows. 
I'd look for bitcoin to go below 2500 with a technical Buy signal, and then follow up with a higher low, THEN I would buy bitcoin for a long term holding position. Otherwise I will continue to patiently wait 
I wanted to share this perspective because I know there are lots of people who want to make money playing bitcoin but don't have experience in markets, this is a dangerous area to long OR short bitcoin. Over time (hopefully the next year or so) it will be more clear the direction bitcoin wants to move and hopefully we can all make money together
