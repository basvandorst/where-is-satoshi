Very few advocate no inequality. Most people focused on social justice and inequality are looking for high social mobility/equality of opportunity, a society that rewards people more proportionally to their impact on humanity and society (e.g. people with large responsibilities in businesses or academia would still make more than others), but they would shrink the wage gap between the highest earners and the median (are people really proportionally more motivated by making 10 vs. 20 million a year vs. increasing the wage of 10000 low paid workers by 1k)?

No ASICs are now a reality. It's a matter of months not years before you will have a hard time making back your capital investment. That said if you have a GPU now and don't pay for electricity go for it. I've made 2 BTC in the last ~40days with a 7870 (~$20 in electricity) so I'm up $140 at the current rate. 30ish more days to pay off the capital in full if the difficulty doesn't go up too much more (I'm not confident in that).

0.237 BTC reward/yr (about $20 at the current rate)
~$33 in power draw (not to mention capital depreciation with heavy CPU load)
