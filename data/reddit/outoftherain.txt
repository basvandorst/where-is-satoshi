I'm considering localbitcoins more and more and torn between cash bank deposit or cash in person.   If you go to a branch on Saturday during opening hours, do you know if they process the deposit the same day or if you have to wait until Monday before it hits the seller's account?

Short of getting a finance degree, how does one become a professional trader?

Good to know re: Finra's 7 yr regulations for  U.S. customers.  Is there an equivalent authority for your Canadian customers and if so, what do they specify?

Thanks a lot Mike, very impressive reaction time.
re: question 4 again: how do you store the faxed docs...or do you enter the ID/utility bill info into your database and then shred them?   Sorry if I seem a little paranoid about possible breach/identity theft issues.  This is just about the only reason I'm torn between signing up for your exchange and buying from localbitcoins instead where the buyer has more control over personal info disclosure and therefore minimization of risk.
re: question 6: process and mail same day: you mean checks via regular mail?

Have you heard about delays in CDN withdrawals, or is it limited to USD?

I see, thanks for your input.

You're right, my bad.

Thanks for your detailed reply chem_death, much appreciated.
For q2, I meant is performing a cash deposit into VoS' BMO USD acct free and do you have to show ID at the bank?   
q4: How did you submit your docs..by uploading to their site or emailing encrypted version with PGP?  I assume uploading..also, do they allow you to cover or obscure sensitive info like your ID's signature or utility bill's account  
q5: How long does it take from making a bank cash deposit until the fiat is credited to your VoS account and do they offer other methods aside from WT?
q6: How long does it take to process withdrawals and which payment methods do they allow you to cash out to?

Interesting idea, I can see it working for non tech users but how about making a proper narrated instructional video with a decent camera?

Thanks for your review.  Some questions if you don't mind.
1. Why you feel cash deposits are good for "poorer" investors
2. is it free and do you have to present ID?  
3. For those of us new to PGP, besides reading the wiki about the theory, can you explain which mail client to use?
4. Did you have to send a copy of your ID and proof of address before being allowed to deposit/withdraw?

It worked for George Costanza so why not the OP?

Thanks for swinging by with an update.  If someone is verified tomorrow and makes a cash deposit during business hours, if you run out of time to credit their account by 5pm, would people have to wait until Monday (next business day)?  Edit: or would you consider having someone processing the credits after hours/on weekends?

Thanks for the warning.  Can you elaborate on "now things got serious and it's a mess"?

Nice, I noticed the founder captaincrunchhn is a user here and did a fair bit of promotion including a hacking competition, ensuring a more robust platform...though I did read one potential hacker whose username is now deleted boasting about returning to the exchange once it was live therefore wonder whether or not the company offers cold storage of traders' ID docs.
There are also a few unanswered questions on their Community page, we can see interest from Canadians is increasing too.
