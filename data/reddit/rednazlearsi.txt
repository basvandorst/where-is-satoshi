That makes sense but as you know upgrading to segwit is a fairly simple task, if large exchanges (that signed s2x) are not doing it for the money (chaper fees) why are they waiting for? to me liquidiy is a much better gain... you can sell more btc, and gain more cash by keeping users btc on the platform.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:42:41
Thank you.

Love this! i'v been looking for a quick script, ill review it and install it on one of my pi's. 
what is the OS that you used? What version so i can have the cleanest process.

**12yo?** I wish! So pure and innocent... 
Seriously tho, I actually build these kind of campaigns for companies, and they tend to work. Normally its just keeping the status quo going.
But with bitcoin doing its thing, its going to be a very hard sell indeed.

If you pay attention to what marketing campaigns are trying to sell to you and when, you can get a glimpse into the internal state of the company the doing promoting.
Timing is key, when a company is worried about its image or it wants to boost sales due to lack of interest (being forgotten/ less attractive) it starts pouring money  into advertising,  famous people are one of the ways to get attention. 
This is one of many attempts to combat the 1000% returns people are getting from bitcoin/crypto, the stock market looks and feels outdated and less attractive to the young generation, hence Kim and Kanye.

Im not spreading FUD...WTF. 
Your claims are correct but still don't explain why exchanges are not implementing Segwit.
In an ideal world your correct, yet you fail to recognize that we are in a mania so its ok to loose customers with 100k new users every day... as long as you can keep selling.
Plus in the long run exchanges are doomed so thats another reason.
For me to spread FUD there needs to be some fear,uncertainty and doubt to spread... I dont see any, for us holders and users, exchanges are paper cups. replaceable. lol

How old are the investors of the future? is there a age limit in crypto? 
Your short sighted... Wall street and fortune 500 companies are not.
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:53:58
I agree. I will never tell someone to invest, I will tell them that I did and that im excited, if they want more info and ask ill answer but never persuade them.
If they are your friend or family you will know who you need to avoid talking to about investing, since they have the wrong tendencies... (gambler, impulsive, holds a grudge, etc)
@_date: 2019-08-12 08:41:28
Well thats true, but when we want to include the rest of the world we can't rely on the current system that does not work for them. Im talking about a global system not a western centric one.   
I see countries more to a more consumption based tax system, not taxing work at all. that way when a person works online it does not matter where he makes his money but where he spends it.
another thought is the "streamable" property of bitcoin, something that will be very hard to replicate in the traditional network.
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:44:53
I act like that with strangers.
I feel like if bitcoin is the investment of the century I’d like the people I love to enjoy the friuts too. Its not fun to have money without friends and family to enjoy it with.
And if its a flop, then we all loose together.
Never force people to invest in somthing just show them why you did.
@_date: 2019-08-02 13:07:53
I own the S and its very easy to use.
It should be straightforward to move the funds off coinbase, generate a receive address using the ledger desktop or mobile app, and then use coinbase sending function.
Make sure to make a small transaction first, not thw whole sum, and double check the address you paste into coinbase.
Good luck :)

If you dont have the seed your out of luck.
If you do then you might be able to using the same wallet you had before.
@_date: 2019-08-02 13:10:34
No seed, no wallet, no bitcoin. Sorry buddy.
@_date: 2019-08-02 16:58:17
100% it was me, it was new to them, they just trust my knowledge. Bitcoin was not even close to the level of mainstream branding as it is now.
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:55:26
Obviously not black and white
@_date: 2019-08-02 16:14:44
Let them try to disprove you, lay the facts down with trusted references to back it up.
We can all probably agree that its a risk, but if your young wo children its the right time to be risky.
@_date: 2019-08-02 17:33:56
It was not my intention to convice but introduce. But i did explain to them why it is worth investigating.
@_date: 2019-08-02 13:45:07
Did it work? Did you get the tip?
@_date: 2019-08-02 15:18:28
How did you get businesses to accept bitcoin? Did you set it up for them? BTCPay server?
What was the most common question?
@_date: 2019-08-02 15:40:34
Very cool! Your a real bitcoiner in the sense that you live off it entirely. You have inspired me to start asking around, to help setup small business around my neighborhood.
I think that the first step of actually asking is the hardest, but as you said the answers are positive. Thank your for the extended reply :)

Robbing a atm is robbing, finding abandond metals carelessly discarded is hardly the same.

The beads are so tiny I had to use a broom to collect them from the cracks in the pavement, took me 2h, the people that own the gold couldn’t care less, the move was careless and haste.

This should be pinned! Used your older guide that used e-clair, lnd is much more powerful happy you switched.
I guessing you where waiting for the bitcoind lnd interface to work first... GOOD JOB!
@_date: 2019-01-06 21:52:16
you will need to know how to ssh into your node and run a list of commands. 
- run a vps on digitalocean or any other service, ssh into that server and run a few commands mainly opening firewall ports.
- add your nodes ssh id_rsa.pub key to your vps .ssh/authorized_keys file, so the node can connect to your vps freely.
- ssh into your node and edit your lnd config abit. 
- then create a .service file in systemd folder to be able to the ssh tunnel at startup.
thats most of the steps... you need to know how to run linux commands and edit files. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 22:41:04
I'm using a digitalOcean vps that has a static ip for 5$ a month. 
After exchanging ssh public keys im able to connect my node to the remote vps with autossh that way I can keep a persistent connection to my node from the outside world.
/usr/bin/autossh -o "ServerAliveInterval 10" -o "ServerAliveCountMax 3" -N -R [0.0.0.0:10009]( VPS\_USER
Your forwarding requests to port 10009 on the vps to your nodes 10009 local port.
@_date: 2019-01-05 16:47:13
Im not sure that they are compatible...
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:00:14
Here you go :)
@_date: 2019-01-05 11:47:24
Well I just opened and closed channels randomy not thinking about on chain fees :( ill be more careful.
@_date: 2019-01-06 21:52:39
Thanks man!

Thanks :)
@_date: 2019-01-09 23:48:44
Its more of an internet facing ip issue, if you have a static ip and a way to open ports to the internet you have a reachable server. using DO 5$ servers allow you to do exactly that when you cant get a static home internet ip.

If you have your keys in cold storage and don't want to expose them to an online environment. Extra paranoid i guess.
@_date: 2017-10-10 07:41:33
- laziness mainly
- I like to post with random accounts, I have another main account that's for viewing/reading and upvoting.
- well something's wrong with the way they think... I'm sorry for them ;)
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:15:28
Your smart. you can do it in 4 steps, not everyone is as smart as you so they need 48 steps :)

Keys will be stored in keychain on iOS and the Android equivalent.
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:36:58
its back up
@_date: 2017-10-10 07:43:43
I'm lazy, its a long process "unfreezing" the coins from cold storage ;)
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:21:13
Not sure you can check on their github.
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:22:02
Its not that easy and really depends on your setup,
For some it might be straightforward.
@_date: 2017-10-17 11:54:23
im here for questions
(medium post got deleted for some reason...)
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:29:03
mmm its better than doing the process on your phone or pc, turnkey linux is a common tool for security experts and bitkey is built using turnkey.
i'v gone thru the bitkey code and it looks legit, basically limits electrum, and networking is the cold offline mode. and adds a list of usefull opensource tools.
seems legit, and worked for me :)
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:44:14
Very similar, just comes with cold offline, cold online and hot online modes. the different modes keep you safe.
And bitkey has a set of open-source bitcoin tools too. 
What I like about tails is the Tor integration, but its not that important to me... 
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:56:42
Ya not going to use my orig account, iv been around for some time ;)
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:14:56
Your right about the psychological aspect, yet it can go both ways, as you set lower goals the app actually encourages the user to actually spend the bitcoin on that goal, thats in theory anyway...
@_date: 2018-07-19 14:28:23
*Sorry Buddy, you just lost your BTC or BCH.
you can't send BCH to BTC (vice versa) addresses. 
BCH is not BITCOIN.* 
@_date: 2017-10-17 11:46:38
what didn't work? it works very well actually. 
try importing to normal electrum and then export the seed, and import the seed to the electron cash wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:54:34
Bitkey for security -&gt; created a new wallet -&gt; sent funds to the new wallet .
Bitkey -&gt; installed the electron cash -&gt; imported old wallet seed -&gt; sent to shapeshift -&gt; converted to btc and sent to my new btc wallet. Voila!
@_date: 2018-12-25 09:04:27
Well in my mind we should have a venmo style bitcoin app, you puchase load money into the app (bitcoin is hidden in the back ie powered by bitcoin) 
You can send it to friends or mangage group payments etc.
The amount you have gose up and down with the bitcoin tide, this is a fun to have with a small amount ($100).
Basically you make the user feel its just normal fiat, but in fact they have bitcoin, the more advanced users will move on to Transfering bitcoin in and out of the wallet.
Lets use it as intended a protocol, hide the branding as much as possible, lets call it money.
@_date: 2018-12-26 22:03:41
Wow what a great idea! Satoshi.
