Dlok what do you think about this rally we’re having ? 
Do you think the dip is over or will it tumble again tomorrow ?

I’ve been waiting for a bank transfer for 6 days now, about to be my first real big purchase of a diversified coin portfolio. I just hope that when the money is actually available in my account on the 18th everything is still “on sale”

Hmm so it’s okay if it crashes 80% then ? So according to this Bitcoin May crash all the way down to 4-6k ? Which would be a great time to buy

Hey so if you guys could keep it like this for like 2 more days when my bank transfer to gdax becomes available that would be great. Thanks in advance !

He was being sarcastic, cause the price has always gone back up.

Yea that’s true there’s way more people talking about it and panic selling now. 
I’m not good at knowing when to buy back in, when will we know we hit a floor ? 
Or is that the million dollar question that is anybody’s guess.

Mr.Bakersfield, I trust your opinion for some reason. 
Do you think the price will tumble again tomorrow after this green rally we’re having or is that the end of the dip ? 
( side note: is Bakersfield your last name or do you live in Bakersfield lol)

Yea I’m not sure how low it will go.  A redditor posted this link:
 
 
Where he claims bitcoin won’t go past 15k again and then slowly drop down to 1k. 
So I’m not even sure if I’m 2 days it would be a good time to buy in.
