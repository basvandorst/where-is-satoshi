True, but in that Tweet Trump didn't promise any legislation to hinder Bitcoin or Crypto (probably couldn't if he wanted to).  He just says it's not real money.
His opinion, even though he's dead wrong, can't hurt me either.

You're mad you get to buy a dip on a hot commodity that MUST rise in price due to it's fixed supply and high demand?

Not really.
I support Trump, but he's dead wrong on this.
Same way I love Ron Paul and want to end the Fed, but he's dead wrong on Creationism.
Simple as that.

TDS (Trump Derangement Syndrome) is a real thing an you are proof.
He almost caused a war with NK by being [the first sitting president ever to cross over the DMZ and meet with their leader?]( lol what a warmonger.
unemployment numbers are cooked?  [I guess consumer confidence, wage growth numbers and labor participation rate numbers are also "cooked".]( Right?
How did he cause the stock market to crash with his tweets?  The only person that caused a huge drop was ABC's[Brian Ross who posted a Fake News report about Trump "contacting" the Russians.](  Which was retracted and the clown got fired.
ICYMI, the Dow Jones [hit an all time high today](  Some "crash"

I don't mean to scare people off BTC, I love the stuff, but I would be lying if I said the concern of black market funding of terror group, which  the government of Iran has done in the past.
I want the people of Iran to prosper and succeed with Crypto, but it's just as easy for a extremist government to misuse bitcoin just to dodge sanctions.

low interest rates is a mixed bag
It means lower rates on Mortgages and auto loans, but also means lower rates on savings account.
In addition it allows for more cheap speculation, which can inflate some bubbles if left unchecked (1920s stock market, 1990s-200s dotcoms,etc.)
I prefer higher rates, but that's just me.
@_date: 2019-07-23 15:04:15
You need a history lesson on the CIA
America is at fault for alot of death and desturction in it's past (and present) no doubt.
But this doesn't excuse the blatant human rights abuses happening in Iran, fueled entirely by their theocratic views.
Two wrongs don't make a right.
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:16:32
Then why does he want to appoint someone who wants to go back to[the gold standard?](
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:37:09
I guarantee you Trump gives zero shits about this.
It's one of his many Toile Twitter thoughts. It's not like the guy (McCarthy) denounce the dollar and spited Trump.  He just gave his opinion.

If he does, he will get a backlash from his base of supporter second in strength only to his Syria Missile strikes.
I don't think he knows what he's talking about here and it will fizzle.
Similar how he tweeted he would get tough on Amazon to play fair with their use of subsidizing the USPS's postage and nothing happened.
@_date: 2019-07-15 03:14:22
Yes and no.
It's a thing because people agree its a thing, but also because people TRUST IN it.
No one disagrees that Zimbabwe, Cambodia, and Venezuela have currencies, but nobody TRUSTS their denomination due to their countries' very sketchy economic past.  Whereas Fiat Euros or Swiss Francs are gladly accepted and valued because of a srtronger economic track record.

Remember that Facebook owns Instagram, which means they also have access to the millenials on the platform.

You'd have to ban internet access except through certain controlled points ( a library, work PCs,etc.) and put a cryptomining detection program to alert the government to illicit mining.
Something a Police State like China can do, but not a failed state like Iran or Venuezuela can do.

The Austrian Economics have been correct on this forever.
Fat money has and always will lose value. Period.  Putting faith in a government's creditworthiness is no different than putting faith in a god. At least god has the decency to not tax you for hardwork.
It's why I'm cautiously optimistic in Trump's new Pick for the Fed, [A gold Standard supporter](

I agree that crypto is not the cause of terror, the funding source is.
Poppy Seeds
doesn't matter, they find a away to pay for their actions.
Gov't do need to stop funding terror, but the concern of bad actors using crypto for evil acts is probably why Pompeo made this statement
Look at Iran, who despite sanctions is looking at Crypto as a way to bypass them :
All this while being the biggest state sponsor of terrorism:
TL;DR : Yes some governments sponsor terrorism and the funding can come in many ways, but the concern with crypto is it can bypass restrictions made to stop terror sponsors as in the case of Iran
@_date: 2019-10-14 15:43:38
but you still get ass blasted by other fees on the card.
I have a ternio account, but looking at [their fee page:](


















































They are on par with a traditional prepaid debit card in terms of nickel and diming you with fees.
Not to mention that ridiculous $5 fee unless you spend $750 *a month*
I'd rather leave it   a cold wallet .

It's not that easy to regulate something if it's on the black market. There are laws and process that ban these weapons obviously, but attacks still happen.
I disagree with the SoS's opinion here, but I can see the concern of terrorist laundering their payments through crypto.
@_date: 2019-08-22 17:13:00
Even though you are ignoring their state-sponsoring of terror?  Helping to destroy ISIS is moot if they are funding Hezbollah and Hamas on Terrorist activities.
These sanctions aren't illegal, in fact  most were there when they were there during the previous Administration. The JCPOA (Iran deal) had issues as it was non-binding and not signed by Iran!:
Hell, Obama let Hezbollah run cocaine into the US in his pursuit for an Iran deal:
That's my only concern with Iran using crypto to dodge sanctions; my heart breaks for the Iranian people, but their repressive government clearly has a history of terror-funding.
@_date: 2019-10-14 16:59:24
Did you see the laundry list of fees that card has?
It's not just the $5 a month one (although its crazy to spend $750 a month just to avoid it; that is approaching baby whale territory).
Youre better off using something like Coinbase and convert your crypto to  a bank account.
Or better yet, you can go with someething like the MCO Visa:
This (Ternio) card is not for the majority of Crypto users

China will NEVER allow its citizens to own crypto due to one simple fact: They (the gov't ) can't control it.
China has to either heavily censor (YouTube, facebook,etc.) or ban it and replace  it with a Chinese-Friendly version (WeChat)
