This was created by one of the blackcoin development teams. But I don't think it's warranted to call it spam, someone who only isn't necessarily interested in Blackcoin could still get a lot of enjoyment from this exchange, if you're interested in other altcoins.
Just try it, it's a really nice and smooth exchange. Such a breath of fresh air compared bittrex and cryptsy.

What do you mean short bitcoin? Shorting a currency means standardly at least to agree to a contract in which you purchase currency X with currency Y for a certain rate at a specified date.

There are a few online courses with bitcoin basics. I'd really look into those first.
As the most importat rule, you don't want anyone else holding your private keys. That means you need to secure them though against loss and theft

Explanations have already been given, but I do recommend you try to get the node running as well, there's nothing I like more than the smell of my node firing up in the morning :)

Bitcoin is an open source, revolutionary project. New technologies never work perfectly. Think of cars, the internet, etc. Stop trolling.

Download the latest version first. I thought there were a few improvements to make it go quicker.
Even then it does take a while though.
