The emotional rollercoaster is real
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:39:51
You can feel better knowing somebody out here bought your litecoin and is very happy right now

Nothing regulatory really, that's a legitimate concern. CME has mentioned they wont allow for more than a 20% or so fluctuation in the daily value so that would help. 
Similarly, there are a large number of people waiting for a dip to buy which would certainly put up a large "buy wall" at multiple levels. I would assume dipping the price below $8,000 - $7,000 would require a significant movement.

I see it as people downloading coinbase more than ever and buying the cheapest one because “I can get 5 LTC instead of 0.1 bitcoin!”. My personal opinion obviously, but I don’t necessarily think it’s going to dip just because of the nature of the rise

I tend to agree with you, but I also said the same when I sold my bitcoin at 13k haha. Best of luck, I’m hoping for a dip to buy back into LTC as well

Combination of futures coming out soon and, imo, thanksgiving dinner talks.

Change those to US $ and I'm in the same boat unfortunately.. Sold at $12,900 expecting a correction. $16,900 last I checked.
I don't think this growth is sustainable (why I sold earlier), but theres no telling when the correction starts or how low it will go. I'm scared this is also the first step in a massive pump and dump that will take effect shortly after December 10th.

It’s a great sign for the future of crypto currencies for sure, but these past few days it’s been going too high too fast. Expect a dip, but don’t wait for it .

His bank isn't shorting it so he's not seeing a crash anytime soon. At this point, yeah bitcoin is slightly overvalued in terms of actual usability. It's currently a better store of value until the technology advances, but bitcoin has a better support system than any other crypto to do just that. 
There's no way to tell what will be the crypto of the future, bitcoin just has the media following, the price tag, the market share, and overall the best chance right now. I think he's way off on that $100 valuation though, that puts the total value if every coin is mined at $2.1 billion. 
I'd be curious to read his opinion on other crypto's.

As controversial a statement as this may be in this forum, I really see Ethereum being a better long-term bet in the future. Bitcoin will almost certainly skyrocket and probably be a better investment for first half of 2018, but its the name and price jumps that are driving the price more so than daily transactions or blockchain use. 
If anyone has any opinions on that I'd love to hear them because I'm relatively new to the crypto-game as well (hold both BTC &amp; ETH). Researching this stuff has become a part time job for me haha

That was fast, what’s next? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:07:18
It’s a positive and negative though. I follow r/ethereum as well and all the topics there are on technical subjects and future potential/scalability/etc. While it’s definitely nice to read, sometime I just want exciting conversation on the current price and trends. 
My advice, don’t click on topics you don’t want to read about. There’s a ton of technical conversation here if you look for it. Happy hodling

I'm doubting it will go below the $7,000 mark. Similar to you I have no real evidence, but $1,000 marks seem to be a major psychological factor and I'm guessing there are a ton of people on the "I'll buy at 7k" train. 
That being said I'm upset I got scared off buying the dip thinking it would stay down there a bit longer.
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:11:09
I like  but honestly reddit isn't a bad place either. Combines news with public discussion 
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:57:13
That and Ethereum wouldn't be a bad bet. Little high now, but I'm buying more in the low 320's/high teens. BTC and ETH are my current investment strategies, just never put in more than you're willing to lose.

Ha I was waiting to buy closer to the fork. When I heard it was canceled and shot up I bought at a slight dip expecting the climb to continue. Nope, bought at a almost $7,700 after fees... 
CME Futures are going to be released in the next two months and ETF's should follow shortly. Theoretically this should motivate larger institutional buyers and traders to enter the market and help drive up the price. That's my hope at least, seems bitcoin doesn't agree with logic all the time haha
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:45:20
Why? Future contract shorts need matching longs and CME has stated they are controlling massive daily fluctuations. Volatility is what is keeping many people out of bitcoin, the risk is too high right now. Similarly, many investors aren't buying btc because the exchanges they use for trading aren't set up for cryptos. 
Of course there is some inherent risk to btc with these large institutional investors coming in and toying, but most of them aren't going to take the risk on betting big money shorting something with such a historically strong bull run (at least during initial futures release and just my unsupported opinion).
 The long term is hard to predict, but have some sells set high (I'll probably set mine around 15k) in case of a futures pump and dump and you should be good. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:38:38
I like the optimism. I'm seeing it hit 5 digits by January easily, I'm curious as to who thinks it will dip again before that.

I use coinbase so not just some guy dragging it down, but you're not entirely correct here. They're insured against large scale attacks if Coinbase themselves get hacked or something, your individual account can still be compromised and that is NOT insured.
