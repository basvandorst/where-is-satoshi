Is the warehouse located in Spokane? That probably means your power is going to be too expensive to attract another tenant in the crypto mining space. Unless the market improves dramatically. Need to be well under 5 cents a kilowatt to interesting. But if we hit another crazy bull run people will shoot money at you out of cannons...

Also, there isn’t a single wallet with Satoshi’s billions in it... it’s spread across, I don’t even know how many. So you’d do this bonkers amount of work, and then *only* get 50BTC.

I was turned down by them a few months back, after the “what’s the nature of your business question”. I found a local credit union that would play ball if you’re local to their ONE office.

It’s just across the river, but East Wenatchee is the next county over. That PUD is much more measured in their response...
