and the coins cost more because they are popular and in demand, dont think thats the definition of ponzi scheme

I been in Crypto since like 2010 and only hear this from people who known about it from 2016+
@_date: 2018-01-24 10:02:19
I look at intrinsic value, so no I dont think its worth 10k and when people say its dropping like its done for all I can say is i value a bitcoin at $100, so why does it matter that it drops a couple thousands... lol. Must really suck to be in at even more than 5k, but its def not a ponzi scheme, and as for bubble, it went from 20k to 10k, thats not a pop? the dow jones would go insane if it dropped 10k

It's not that it's negative, he's just wrong and definitely not stating any facts. It's like saying Antarctica has 100F weather all the time

Thats why you cash out when you have $500 million. Cause then you wont pay any tax.
@_date: 2018-09-23 20:12:13
You can't just say stuff like this because it sounds good. Whats happening in crypto and what happened in the big short are like two completely different things.
@_date: 2015-12-09 20:13:06
should be focused on what are your goals and not if you should buy or not

I'm on GDAX and it makes it easy to buy and sell coin on the fly.
@_date: 2016-06-05 01:47:42
Well hes talking about trading, I know we have the whole hold concept but there are others too you know.
@_date: 2019-11-27 04:37:51
Probably the dumbest shit I have ever heard of someone thinking about doing. Spending money to go from a toyota to another toyota.
@_date: 2016-06-05 02:36:35
Im going by the question, he said "buy and sell coin".
All Im saying is give him more relevant info to what he wants instead of what you guys recommend.

I like Bitcoin but its actually funny to me that this would get posted here as Bitcoin definitely has higher fees to send compared to almost every other crypocurrency. Still better than shitbanks.

This needs to be taught to everyone in the world at a young age.

If you sell then yeah, you pretty much are a genius and thats the premise of investing, buying something for cheaper and selling it for higher. I dont see your point on how you need to invest on multiple stock to be a 'genius' investor.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:46:37
To explain this you need to read about what a market is. More people willing to buy than sell increases price of wanted items, its as simple as that. Literally almost everything around you right now has a market.

Only time I hear bitcoin is a scam is from people dont do not understand the technology. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 18:38:15
Can't buy if you dont have any money left
@_date: 2016-09-12 11:51:45
is gdax the same as coinbase?
@_date: 2016-09-12 13:52:44
Oh ok I see, cause I use them. But as far as exchanges do you recommend it, as you said gdax is coinbase and stop using coinbase. Or just stop using coinbase site in general to buy bitcoin cause I agree 100% then.
@_date: 2018-11-30 20:52:13
As it should be.
@_date: 2015-11-03 23:17:38
Please let me know if you find anything, makes absolutely no sense to fuck people in NY.
@_date: 2017-05-18 00:32:00
Sounds like someone being a shill. Theres no reason why BTC cant be improved.
@_date: 2017-05-17 04:32:38
I wont give a shit about Bitcoin very soon if number 3 is not fixed soon enough. I just read about all the stuff about this and the ongoing problems because it was affecting me. There is no point in BTC anymore if I have to wait 12 hours to get it. If regular people start using this it will be more like 1-7 days for confirmation at this point I rather use a bank(im going to use an altcoin). Fuck this shit.

Bitcoin was great back when I first started in 2010. Now it does the same exact shit, is more expensive, I have to pay way more, and Ive been waiting on coins for a extra amount of time. This was not the vision I seen, BTC has backtracked heavily since then. Id only hold on to it cause its like gold right now. The technology is not good anymore.
@_date: 2016-10-14 04:13:56
Bitcoin is a technology, just like an iPod though.
@_date: 2017-05-17 12:53:34
There was literally no point in programming Bitcoin then if that's the case.
@_date: 2015-11-06 08:07:17
I dont even see why anyone is worried.
@_date: 2015-10-31 22:15:55
Probably both
@_date: 2015-10-31 22:16:39
Thanks for the other suggestion!
@_date: 2015-10-31 21:09:13
Hey, I made an account for okcoin but it seems that I cannot even use it as I am from America? 
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:12:25
Just sell before the bubble pops at 10k, then put in a buy order for $1000
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:01:40
I agree on that one too. They will try BTC first. BTC does have a big name, you can mention cryptocurrency, most people wont know what it is, but mention Bitcoin and they do. But what happens when they try BTC for a while and notice that there transaction is getting longer and longer? IMO the consumer will make a switch. It wont happen anytime soon though, or at all. Just my thoughts.
