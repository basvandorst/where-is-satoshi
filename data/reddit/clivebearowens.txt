Youre not crazy at all. I dont know what you hope to get from posting this here through. At best you might get some people that barely understand the underlying technology trying throw you into submission by chucking as many buzzwords as they can at you either that or HODL or some other contrived bullshit.

As long as people want to buy things they cant presently afford we will always have banks in one form or another.

1. Use some of your bitcoin to buy a stolen identity off the darkweb
2. Obfuscate your bitcoin through mixers and wash through  untraceable altcoins
3. transfer the washed crypto into accounts in the stiffs name
4. Open a used car dealership so you can slowly launder the money into your accounts
5. ???????
6. profit

All the dumb money follows bitcoin as an indicator for the entire cryptospace.

I love when people just throw buzzwords together and think they make sense.
Its even better when they formulate ideas and opinions in this manner!

You just went from tossing trashwords together to actually being forward thinking and making sense. You have to watch that on these forums its frowned upon. You aren't wrong with this second post though. Bitcoin lost sight of the future and lost its identity in the process. Most of bitcoins growing pains could have been avoided with proper foresight and the elimination of greed form the human condition.
If you want a real payment system you are better off going elsewhere. Lightning network might be the godsend everyone here is praying for but you wont see mass adoption till Q1 19 and that would be a stretch. Whether or not bitcoin will hold out as a store of value for the time being is pure speculation.
