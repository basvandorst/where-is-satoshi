Greetings, I would like to take a moment and discuss my up and coming blog and what I have planned for it.
Let me start out be saying it is a totally new blog! As in I only have the first initial posts up. I plan to add a new post each day. The posts will be about Bitcoin discussion topics or world news about Bitcoin. 
Of course right now the blog looks super bland. The next month my entire focus is to get the blog streamlined and looking good. It will have all original graphics and content. If I pull any content from anywhere else I will always give credit where it is due. All we want to do is make a site to discuss particular topics for the Bitcoin world. We have no plans what so ever to steal content and make it our own. After all we are a small team of 2 , why would we try to do something like this?
Other planned features include but are not limited too:
-Our own faucet.
-Setup guides for different types of mining equipment, all original of course.
-Contests where BTC will be given out as prizes.
-Subjects of up and coming scryptcoins that are worth mining.
-Trading tips, guides on Market Analysis and general financial advice revolving around trading btc.
-And More!
Thank you for your interest in the blog, I hope to see you there. I just added the first topic for discussion today so please take a minute out of your day and talk with us.

This will get downvoted all to hell. But I just had this gut feeling to never trust a "currency exchange" that started out trading magic the gathering... It's personal reasons behind this too. Mainly the social stigma that MTG players all have. I know I use to be one. They are nothing but assholes that do nothing but talk shit about one another and then act all friendly face to face. I'm speaking entirely on matters that involve around the game they play.
Now take that mentality and try to work it into a business situation... It doesn't work. I know this all sounds silly, but it is my personal reasons for never using MT.Gox. 
It's selfish I know, but I never trusted them and I was right not too. In stock exchanges this mentality is very common. You don't feel sorry for the people who made bad trades or lost thier money on a scam... you just don't do it. Do your research first people and decide from there if you can really just an organization. I know all the stuff I said is Biased but again... I was right to follow my gut feeling this whole time. Those feelings were all stereotypes and it proved to be accurate. It's sad but true, believe in stereotypes they do exist for a reason.
