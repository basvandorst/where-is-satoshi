Apple is massively popular and successful with consumers for the same reason McDonald's is massively popular and successful with consumers and that's because consumers are, in large part, fucking retarded morons who have no idea what the fuck they are doing.
Apple is a horrible, disgusting cancer on the throat of our society and on technology too.
You must be a fucking idiot.
