.....I'll know it is time to sell.
@_date: 2019-07-20 16:26:25


It already happened.

His tweet was a response to the FED Chair.
He was literally disagreeing with the Chair of the Federal Reserve.

I voted For DJT in 2016 and was a consistent supporter (check my comment history), but don't fuck with my money.
Trump messing with Bitcoin and/or encryption is something that would cause me so not vote for him for reelection in 2020.

The fiat dollar has enabled far more than Bitcoin, by many orders of magnitude .

Look who's talking.
I just now checked the charts, BTC is hodling steady , while everything else is getting crushed.

Who is Ron Paul?
@_date: 2018-09-27 23:39:15


Agreed. 
Breaking backwards compatibility with legacy addresses would be a mortal wound to bitcoin.

No sir, based on u/ramalamadingdongs proposal, that decision is solely the right of the sender, NOT the receiver (i. e. the merchant).  The merchant has a receiving public bitcoin address, how I get my payment to them and the miner that is used is not their prerogative.

The solution, that I can think, would be for the operators of the electrum servers, would also have the option to upgrade them to watch towers.  This would allow the electrum server operators to have another income stream.

People who say that they would like it to go lower, are usually the same who don't have the balls to put their money where their mouth is, after it goes lower.

Will go between 30k to 35k this year then do a retreat back to 9k 10ish.
 Then a month or 2 after next halving (about a year from now,) start the climb to 100k.
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:57:31


What if I told you that,
 2018, was the correction?
@_date: 2019-06-23 03:14:10
Anyone who put any serious money into bitcoin before 2013 and hodl, should have f**K all money.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:58:33


I made the same mistake in 2013-2014.
While, I am doing OK , I would be in the "Fuck You" position now, if I never sold.

If you believe in the long term fundamentals, "Dollar cost averaging" Period.
That advice goes for any investment, not just Bitcoin.
IMHO, I believe it is a long term rise until after the next halving. i. e. there will be "dips" (OMG it is crashing) between now and then.  
Oh and what happened the last 24 hours was NOT even a dip on my radar.

All of us long term HODLERS do.
And I am speaking from 2013.
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:34:57
Hodl until at least 7 months after next years halving.
AT this point, it is all about "the halving"

Nailed it. 
Was surprised to realize it was written weeks ago.
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:32:25


Let me know when you buy in,
so I can sell.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:09:43


As I read that, I can imagine a future where those words are carved onto a monument.
BTW, upvoted you.
