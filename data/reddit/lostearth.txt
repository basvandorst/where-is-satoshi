What argument do you perceive that I am making?
I do support reality and I support trends to identify risk.
Recall that risk may be defined as the product of the likelihood of an event's occurance and the significance of the event's occurance.

Plus one for you.
The analogy isn't all that far off mate.
Well perhaps it is because when the fat lady sings you won't even have a cute little plushie to hold as you cry about about all the USD you gambled away.

Oh dear.  You are too far along to save.  
If you bought BTC keep buying; someone has to support the bottom.

Stay classy

No thank you.
USDs by the way are not money... They are currency.
Ponzi schemes also go on year after year after year Until enough people squawk.
BTC is a classic pozi scheme. Read that last sentence again.  Read it again.
When you start asking for your $20,000 per BTC payout and so does the guy across your dorm hallway and do does the sorority sister across campus and so does Frank living at home with his mom... and all you guys do to you ll find that the markets don't allow you to sell and the next day you will have a penny or two of the "huge" $5k you put in before you understood the gamble you were making.  
If you have friends who have cashed out their BTC lately you give them a high five and congratulate them but for what?  Taking YOUR funds right out of your wallet man.
Get with it.

Bitcoin and housing are getting compared??!!?? The housing market crashes and I have a house that is worth less but still is a home to someone's family.  
What exactly is the value of bitcoin that remains when the show ends?  It's other people's money.  Bitcoin crashes and what do you have???  Nada;  not even an insurance payout.  There really is no tangible value whatsoever.  When you buy into BTC you are 1)providing a loan to the folks who already own BTC and are cashing out (but the guy that cashes out hands the loan note to the rest of the BTC owners) and
2)are now waiting for a lot more volume of new BTC purchases to allow you to sell out at (hopefully) a higher price.

No that is summarily not a good point. Minus one point for you.

I am open to critical ideas.
I am guessing that you believe me to be generally supporting of the USD (or any other fiat currency) over BTC; is this what you're argument is based on?
If so you are incorrect.
But I believe another argument you're making is that BTC is not a fiat "currency"/asset and that is also incorrect.
Read up on Charles Kindleberger.

I will not try to guess when. But there is no doubt the top and bottom will fall out and will make more losers than winners.
