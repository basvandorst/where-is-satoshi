Ah! That's interesting...i guess i should save up my purchases to maybe $50 to $100 or so then transfer it? Or should I just leave it in coinbase?
I've been doing the whole personal wallet for a good while now as I've heard that if something were to happen to my btc in Coinbase, i may well be SoL? Is that true?

Now question, if I transfer from gdax  to a personal wallet there will be fees included correct?

Are the miner fees lower transferring to bitcoin wallet? I did it from coinbase and my $10 transfer had a $3 fee to it. Only moving $7. I was a bit peeved with that.

Agreed! Definitely wouldn't want to plunk down anything that much. I'll definitely start it as a hobby/side project of sorts. Thank you for the tips!

Oooo..thanks for that heads up as well!

No need to be sorry. You've honestly offered plenty of advice. Thank you very much on this!

You're right, I definitely haven't been doing as much research as I should be. What I've been doing is buying $5 - $10 worth on each pay check or if I see the price drop. I've looked into mining but didn't see it was worth it, ive looked into some drip BTC but that doesn't seem worth it for any of the trouble either.
My electric bill isn't that great... but I don't see myself running a beefy machine to mine Bitcoin as that would wind up bringing my bill to $200+. I do have a small Lenovo desktop PC (m92p) that maybe I can do alt mining with?

I have a small Lenovo M92P desktop with an i5 3470 processor and an intergrated Intel HD Graphics 2500 (I know this doesn't mean much but i'm running a PS2 emulator off of it pretty smoothly surprisingly)
I have my gaming PC as well
I5-6700 processor NVidia 980GT  i believe
I have laptops as well if they would be good for mining alt coin

I never thought of alt mining before...despite Bitcoin being so high, would say it's worth it to even start altcoin mining?

Thank ya! I was wondering where I could start looking!

I truly wish my electric bill was free, at my parents place its free but i'm nowhere near them and im not about to hook up my gaming machine over there. I think i have another older video card/PC(ATI Video card forgot which) lying around but again as you said. it may not be worth the cost.

You sure you weren't mishearing that? Maybe...poopies?

At the moment I'm buying Bitcoin at $5 - $10 and I'm wondering if im doing okay in investing in this. Currently have about $75~ after starting this in...maybe December I wanna say? I'm also investing in litecoin and looking to hop into etherium soon when I can 
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:26:56
Ah that makes sense...
@_date: 2017-07-15 00:25:49
*is now shunned* what have I done!!!
