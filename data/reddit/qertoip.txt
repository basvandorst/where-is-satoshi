It's weird this analytical pro Bitcoin (Core) video got downvoted. Not a single time BCash was even referenced. Just weird.
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:47:22
It's not 100x, it's temporarily ~35x, and soon down to ~7x.

We need on-chain fungibility by yesterday.
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:53:34
Just see their own block explorer - it's fully transparent.
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:22:19
The scam part relates to privacy and anonymity claims - Verge is 100% transparent like Bitcoin. Even the built-in TOR was found not working (naked IPs): 
Stealth addresses ("wrath protocol") was delayed multiple times while being advertised as existing feature. Then, once it got live, this page claims it doesn't work: 
Finally, they forked legacy Dogecoin instead of well-maintained Bitcoin, incurring large technical debt on inception.
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:11:41
Verge is a scam with non-existing privacy features.

I believe you can't redeem BTC w/o KYC.
@_date: 2019-07-26 20:16:31
1. Indeed but this only concerns tx amount and only if the intention would be perfect hiding. There are weaker amount privacy improvements that do not endanger auditability.
2. This is fully compatible with default privacy and so not an argument against. See Monero view keys as an example.
3. The contrary! Once cryptocurrencies are banned, would you rather pay with transparent Bitcoin or Monero?
4. Indeed. This is the real obstacle.

Only **members** of the Liquid network are able to peg-out L-BTC back to BTC. Currently, there are a total of 35 Liquid members.
The end-users cannot peg-out by themselves. They need to go through one of the 35 companies.

@_date: 2019-07-26 20:04:12
You can't use Liquid this way as an end-user.

The bitcoin.com wins in google search from most IP locations :( We should improve google treating of  by following google guidelines, doing proper organic linking, etc.

As a Pole I can confirm WOŚP is the largest and most respected charity organisation in Poland. WOŚP is also organiser of the famous annual music festival "Woodstock".
Bitcoin is accepted by the local branch though. It is a bit hacky ATM.

Lopp rulez.

The king pair is XMR / BTC:
@_date: 2019-08-05 18:56:19
Yes, that would be the next 17 people ;) A proverbial 2-of-2 happy Bitcoin couples.
@_date: 2019-08-05 21:41:08


I explicitly referred to **direct ownership** and not custodial solutions or other proxies.
Yes, there might be a proverbial Bitcoin couple, co-owning the funds. Which changes nothing in terms of actual numbers. There also might be a legal entity owning some bitcoins, in which case that is a single legal person.
@_date: 2019-12-24 01:50:02
In Samourai's case that option would require running your own Dojo.

I only had excellent experience with Bitrefill.

Tied to something via its history. Anything basically. A gambling service. A theft. A darknet market. An identity of a person. Or specific company.
@_date: 2019-12-24 01:47:31
You don't really need a full block explorer. You just need a wallet to be able to present tx details w/o outsourcing the job.
@_date: 2019-12-10 10:58:18
It's API only and relies on batching to cut down on fees. May be useful in the future.
@_date: 2019-12-10 10:42:08
Thank you. Good to know if one needs to automate. Although this time I am more looking for options I could recommend for general usage.
@_date: 2019-12-10 09:13:54
Maybe an overkill for your budget but otherwise [ is the best way to go.
@_date: 2019-12-10 10:37:11
Good point. Although much broader problem than this use case. Relates to any and all received coins (except coinbase).
@_date: 2019-12-24 00:56:59
A big fan of. Wasabi is very close but even there I would welcome the switch just to make sure:
1. merging pre and post mix UTXOs is not allowed
2. my full node is enforced and no fallback of any kind will happen
3. external block explorers disabled
...and probably other details.
@_date: 2019-12-10 10:39:51
Thank you! This is basically what I was looking for. PS There is a small inconvenience related to fee deduction from the output amount (needs to be manually taken into account).
@_date: 2019-12-10 10:38:20
Thank you! Nice list there. Some of them are still online ;)
@_date: 2018-11-01 15:31:57
One can still get his ass in the **historical first 10 rounds of trustless mixing**! If only for fun!
@_date: 2018-03-06 10:12:28
They accept both with XMR rapidly growing.
@_date: 2018-03-03 21:09:30
The effort they put into Bisq development is monumental. Run the software. See the source. Read the docs.
The issue for me is not missing trust in developers (they definitely earned the trust).
The issue is that 2 human arbiters don't scale and are not resilient.
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:14:48
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:52:28
There is nobody in the middle. The arbiter is on the sidelines and never in possession of the funds. Security deposits are in a 2-of-3 multisig.
@_date: 2018-03-03 18:56:04
Bisq is very sophisticated in that regard. It only accepts **cryptographic proofs** for fiat transfers!
This means either PDF statements **signed by the bank** or the "proof of screen" by TLS Notary / PageSigner ( 
If you can't provide those, you lose the dispute.

Centralized exchanges are faster and more convenient.
People have not fully realized the drawbacks yet, including the complexity of properly calculating and paying taxes in most jurisdictions.
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:37:56
Ripple Labs, Inc. brace yourself.
@_date: 2018-03-03 17:04:12
I believe your scepticism is healthy.
My understanding is that currently Bisq founders themselves are the only arbiters to bootstrap the community (yes this aspect is 100% centralized).
"Who arbitrates the arbiters" - I don't know the answer.
@_date: 2018-03-03 21:26:00
There is no central server -&gt; everyone is the server.
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:14:33
Hypothetically, yes but nothing actionable. Poles are OK with local PLN which BTW appreciates nicely against EUR and USD.
@_date: 2019-01-04 14:39:56
How is this calculated? Any background info? Thanks!
@_date: 2018-03-03 18:45:37
Yes, including SEPA EUR transfer support.

@_date: 2018-02-19 11:09:48
Thanks! That indeed confirms the amount around $27.5K.

Plenty of time to adjust, practical QC won't suddenly appear out of nowhere, the technology progress curve is very predictable, including across paradigm shifts.
@_date: 2018-03-03 21:25:02
Can confirm.

I am from Poland. Not sure about the exact amount but I do confirm Polish Central Bank ("NBP") in cooperation with Polish Financial Authority ("KNF") paid a locally famous Youtuber to FUD cryptocurrencies. And he delivered.

It's easy to solve, i.e. limit the number of free notifications.
@_date: 2018-04-11 08:23:21
Highly recommended piece.

The news is legit, except it is not €400M. It is "just" €300M or $374M.
The exchange rate is about 4.20 PLN per EUR and 3.40 PLN per USD.
