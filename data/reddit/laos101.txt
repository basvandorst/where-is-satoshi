I think it's hard to say whether it's a "huge bluff" because we don't know the calculus of the hacker. They went to the press to get attention, tried to scrounge up 25 BTC, and everything died down very quickly. At this point it depends on whether we hear something emerge from the darknet or elsewhere.
I still stand by my opinion though that Bitcoin seems to be doing just fine despite even bigger elements of chaos at work from China and elsewhere.

Read the article. Both actually. At the very least let's build a more trusting community in ways beyond asset protection. But a good start would include at least considering underwriters for some Exchanges or wallets. It's a cost, but it adds a great amount of trust, especially to newcomers to Bitcoin.

This is also an alternative! Would take more steps and less instant, but assure there is no way your assets can be lost crypto-wise. Currency is a tad more complicated though.

They don't make top-down decisions (right now) but nonetheless they pay the bills and they collect the money. If push were to come to shove in any sense core development is where the Foundation would make its voice very loud and clear. The BF is not necessarily in charge but it's no coincidence the former lead developer is the chief scientist, etc. I'm sure they aren't backseat driving but even if there was complete autonomy the two groups I imagine work closely, and if someone on the executive board was elected and pushed a certain agenda to the development it would have some measurable influence.
Also I think the focus of the piece is less on what the developers are doing and more about what the Foundation isn't doing, which is representing Bitcoin as well as other orgs like Coinbase and BitPay, focusing on the bigger picture beyond legal lobbying and the miner &amp; exchange end of the equation.

The article isn't saying this will happen. It's saying that if Bitcoin doesn't take threats from established, wealthy financial firms seriously, that it could be simply made out-of-date by their marketing and innovative power.
