CoinAbul         NEGATIVE FEEDBACK unfortunately
I bought some silver. I chose at the check out from the list of available countries and filled in my street address.
I have paid  8.7576 BTC
I have paid extra for the most expensive delivery option - fast &amp; safe.
Therefore I got a bit upset when my order was sitting for days marked as 'pending'.
I only received reply on my third enquiry about this. Fifth day from my BTC payment. Coinabul was apologising they were not able to ship to my country.
Their failed to deliver. 100% CoinAbul's fault. Instead of immediate refund CionAbul kept using my resources. They only wrote they would refund me. Nothing happened for several days. So I started to chase them over email. No response.
Eventually I found 'coingenuitÿ́' user on bitcoin-otc. After that he started to talk to me. He made excuses and indicated a refund is coming. It took one more reminder from to make him to proceed to a refund.
Unfortunately he sent me instead of my 8.7576 BTC refund some bloody MtGox voucher.
I redeemed it at MtGox !!!immediately!!! into BTC. But was given from MtGox for this MtGox voucher only BTC 6.70607025
So now I am still missing 8.7576 - 6.70607025 = 2.05152975 BTC
During the ten days CoinAbul was misusing my BitCoins the USD/BTC market exchange rate was fluctuating up above and down below what it was at the moment of my purchase. The invoice was in BTC the deal was in BTC.
This is my experience with CoiAbul.
If the deal failed in result of a 3rd party' fault then yes. Fair enough. But not if you list Zimbabwe as a country u ship to and then u realize u made a mistake as u unable to ship to Zimbabwe. In my case it wasn't Zimbabwe but one of European Union countries. Therefore I have no doubt CoinAbul is using this pattern to make easy money. I had been requesting refund for 10 dais and they proceeded to refund me at a moment when USD/BTC rate was down. CoinAbul still has Czech Republic on the list of countries they sell to and therefore there are more Czech people to be robed of. They need to be cautioned.
