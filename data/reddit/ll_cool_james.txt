CoinSpots great for altcoin selection. Just keep in mind their fee is a bit on the higher end at 2%

It is a valid BIP 31 bitcoin URI, with a BIP 70 payment URI. Most wallet software supports this format.

Bitpay haven’t created their own protocol though. The payment protocol is described in BIPs 70-73, and is supported by most wallet software and libraries, and was authored by Gavin.

Depends on country. Here in Australia, our tax office (ATO) deems trading one crypto for another a taxable event, with CGT owing on the nominal price of the trade.

The great thing about git is that the source code and any changes - from the beginning of time - is stored immutably in the git repository history. Not unlike the blockchain, I suppose. The last commit from Vitalik can be viewed here:

HD wallet / 12 word passphrase implementation - on the iOS version at least - doesnt appear to be compatible with neither Bread Wallet nor Hive Wallet. 
By contrast, I have no issues using my passphrase in Bread Wallet and importing into Hive, and seeing correct balances and history.
Will pass for now

Very true. In fact, I believe Jamie Hynemann from Mythbusters incorrectly thought the same thing (i.e. sum the two velocities), and was proven wrong when they tested it.

Re 2) - You've simply replaced chargeback risk with double spend risk. As a merchant, I can simply accept CC and be guaranteed I will get paid once the transaction clears through my acquirer / payment processor, for a small interchange fee.

Perhaps already been considered, but sending your friend a never used before address would guarantee anything sent to it could only have come from your friend.
@_date: 2017-04-12 01:53:44
Re 1) - you're talking about the merchant. For a consumer, why would I want to go through the rigmarole of unlocking my phone, opening wallet app and scanning QR codes when I can simply tap my CC, have my payment go through in seconds, and earn reward points / cash back at the same time?

Question on usability. I notice that the "remove standard fees" toggle now has two options -- disabled (toggle is on the left) and "ask" (toggle on the right, highlighted red.) When it's highlighted red, does that mean standard fees will be removed, but will prompt? What about what it's disabled?

Vanity addresses are a thing. There used to be vanity address "miner" that would take in your target prefix and keep generating private keys until the address matches your target.

Is Bip32 support still broken?
@_date: 2015-02-21 02:52:34
Hmm, then perhaps you can help me understand something. Using my 12-word passphrase in Mycelium, I'm not able to see my transactions or balance. Both Mycelium and breadwallet claim to support bip32. Would it be accurate to say that there's a bug in one of the two implementations? 
You can test this yourself. Generate address in breadwallet and send some btc to it. Use same 12 word passphrase in Mycelium -- nothing appears.
@_date: 2015-02-21 03:04:02
Follow up question then -- when will breadwallet support bip44 :)

This is a good question, and is something I've been wondering a lot myself as well. It's hard to imagine how the price wouldn't be impacted with upcoming uncertainty around chain splits and what not, but then again the price hasn't done much even now, with current problems with stuck transactions and full blocks /shrug

Bingo. LN relies heavily upon being able to sign and exchange transactions off-chain, and subsequently build off of these signed but not broadcasted transactions. Transaction malleability prevents this being done efficiently, which is what Segwit aims to fix.
