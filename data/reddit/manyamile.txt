Do you mean like paying for electricity?

I'm at home with the flu and feel like crap. This made me laugh. Thanks for that.

Of all the fun things that have come out of bitcoin, this will always be my favorite.

Only one? Those are rookie numbers.

Remember when Saddam Hussein repriced Iraqi oil in Euro instead of the USD?

At the end of the day, we must hold ourselves accountable for our actions. While I share your opinion about loan officers making false claims and a poor regulatory environment, you can't simply sweep away the accountability of those who lied on a loan application.

Well, [it **was**]( It was shut down in July.

I don't disagree with any of that and at the end of the day, every one of those issues come down to a combination of individuals not taking personal responsibility for their actions and greed. It is indeed a big fucking joke.

Happy to help. Good luck.

You'd need to use a decentralized exchange, a smart contract that would lock up both party's funds and release them when the terms of the agreement were met, or a trusted third-party broker (i.e. someone you both trust to hold the coins and cash and release them to the two sides once the transfers were complete). Good luck finding any of those...
You may want to check out  as an option but using an exchange is going to be a lot less expensive in the long run.

Yes you need to sign up for an account. That allows you (and a seller) to build reputation similar to an eBay account. As a buyer, you'd want to be cautious buying from someone with no transactions or a bad reputation.
Once you've signed up though, you can find people who are willing to transact through a lot of means (meet in person for cash, Amazon gift card codes for BTC, PayPal transfers, bank transfers, Venmo, etc). You'll pay a higher rate than through an exchange like GDAX or Gemini but less than if you used a [bitcoin ATM](

Dude. [Don't Buy Bitcoin. It's Going To Crash!!!](

Assuming you're in the US...localbitcoins, Coinbase or Gemini once you're verified (don't expect an immediate response), a local BTC ATM.

First things first. You need to buy some new towels. Nothing beats the feeling of drying off with a thick, fluffy new towel. Once that's done, plow the remaining balance into BTC now and hold.

And make the exchange in a well-lit, well trafficked, safe location. It also doesn't hurt to bring a friend with you depending on the amount being transacted.

I'd not seen this before. Thanks for sharing.

1. Buy BTC.
2. Sell BTC for USD.
3. Transfer USD back to bank account.
4. Pay capital gains taxes. Uncle Sam will come for his share.

Not OP but they're are a lot of them across the US.
We have 3 near me - all in really shitty parts of town and the fees are astronomical.

You're absolutely right. It's definitely interesting to witness. I had to stop reading through comments on today because so many people are rationalising the behaviour of a complex financial system. Having lived through similar market situations before (Bre-X, the dot com boom, and several real estate flashes), I just have to shake my head at people who think up is the only direction.

A large number of people with little to no understanding of market forces are getting a real world lesson in [mean reversion]( I'm not sure I'd call that "fun to watch".
