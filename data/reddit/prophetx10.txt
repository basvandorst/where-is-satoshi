typically, if i recall correctly, in the academic literature "mass adoption" begins at about say 34% of the consumer population which is the "early majority" phase.  So in the USA that would be something like 100 million people.

"bitcoin-like technology" who wrote this a 5 year old?
@_date: 2014-09-21 07:41:42
exactly right.
the whole point of high inflation early in the life of the coin is so that people give it away or use it in transactions to get as much adoption as possible.
not sit around like a bunch of hording trolls in their basements looking at the interest rates they get for doing nothing.

"Not really, we had colored coins p2ptrade back in 2012. It had only one centralized component: messaging, but it can be trivially replaced. A proof-of-concept version which used BitMessage for messaging appeared few months ago."
one central component = if central therefor not secure, since requires trust in 3rd party.

sounds like a real pain in the ass, i have enough stuff to worry about why add one more worry vector 
@_date: 2014-01-25 22:22:55
well that is hard to say, i certainly do not have a crystal ball, and wide spread is a relative term when Bitcoin wallets only about 0.1% of the worlds house holds.
after the distributed exchange between BTC and MSC is done (in a few more weeks the testing should be done), the next thing up is savings and guardian addresses which can be done rather quickly and then move on to things like user currencies, CFDs/betting, smart properties and so on.
We are hosting/sponsoring a hackathon in TX Bitcoin Conf in March and another in Israel in May.  Around that time the APIs and functionality in the spec should be more baked in the codebase so we can start focusing on more developer marketing and events like hack spaces, hackathons, tech workshops, etc.  At that point I think someone in the community will strike some real gold.
My personal idea is that it will be gaming related (not gambling) as I think that is the thing that could go most viral. People need to have fun with something before they take it seriously, and that drives creativity relating in innovation.  I.e., Dogecoin is technically innovation by the recombination of a meme with a coin, and bitcoin itself was not taken that seriously by people a few years back.

I disagree on the adoption (it is very very low at the moment and the development is too risk averse slowing down innovation).  I don't really consider Coinbase.com and Circle to be really representative of adoption since they link identity to transactions/addresses.
At face value you correct about XCP funding however they choose a strategy of being indirectly funded since, as I am aware, some of that team, if not all, did personally burn BTC for XCP, which gives them funds to support themselves. 
I did mention to the Viacoin guys they should have figured out a way to link XCH ("clearinghouse" fork of xcp, they did not burn Via) with Via somehow so that the native ecash coin is also the same currency for the smart assets system but I think they wanted to go ahead and launch their system.  I don't see that happening on Bitcoin until someone else does it (i.e., risk aversion bias for the leader).
Your last sentence is perplexing and suffers from a chicken/egg problem.  One cannot simply say they are scamcoins and then say that they have created something of value that Bitcoin developers will fork and merge, and that they are scamcoins because an outside group takes their work, which would likely not have been done otherwise, and attempts to make it worthless.  The only way for that to happen is for the Bitcoin development team to bring into the fold those developers, as they are the experts in this field and will no doubt garner a much larger community of developers and far outpace the innovation being done with the bitcoin core dev group which would lag behind in copy/pasting and refactoring additions to code.
And frankly, I don't see why many from those teams would join given how the Bitcoin dev group has generally interacted with those groups. And the attempt at doing something like that (which will likely fail) also sets a very bad precedent that Bitcoin Core Dev's will attempt to cannibalize and kill off any innovative projects which use Bitcoin in a non-conformist way (not to mention it smells of some kind of central control committee).
I could be wrong but that is how I analyze the state of this. Obviously you all can change and change is good.
BTW - although I did do some work for Mastercoin I do not think that such a centralized funding model works very well, obviously as can be seen from the XCP vs MSC performance.  Via did a MSCish type fund raiser but I hope they take a different approach. We'll see what they come up with.

@_date: 2016-03-05 01:01:28
think of it this way....
the code in bitcoin can do a few things for you, i am certain, like i, you have not read the actual code.  for example...
you can make a multiparty address, where all parties need to sign off on sending out some btc to another address.  so a multisig address is technically speaking a digitally enforced agreement between the owners of the multisig address that says the funds can only be sent with the approval of m of n signers.
of course there are a few other things that bitcoin can do.  
what ethereum did was just expand on that and allowed developers to write in their own logic rather than waiting on new "features" to be implemented into the core functionality.

I think this assessment is correct. They know that it is unlikely that people will support a hardfork for larger blocks if SW exists, and therefore that is the bargaining chip. Once they get that then they can let SG get adopted.  That is the situation that creates the optimal revenue outcome.
Maybe I am wrong though, but if I were running a business I would also do everything I can to maximize revenue.
On the flip side anyone offering solutions that use SW (i.e., LN) knows that by limiting the block size that they get to be cash flow positive faster.
So as I said somewhere earlier here, it's just people arguing over how much of the pie they get.

The very first users of bitcoin were all miners. Miners are all users. They have to enforce the rules as well. It is just that they have the power to have consensus amongst themselves, and if you don't like that you can start mining on your own and get attacked with 0KB blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-24 07:57:39
today btc is only censorship resistant if one has enough money to pay these escalating fees.  here's a news flash most rich people aren't censored; this is not a problem just looks at all the money laundering most banks do for their rich clientele.  the problem is the censorship of people who don't have money who apparently won't be able to use btc very soon. btw maidsafe has also built in an ecash like system and does not use blockchains at all.

I've contacted Satoshi Nakamoto, CEO of Bitcoin Corporation Ltd. to send Coinwallet and cease and desist order, and inform them that they are unauthorized to makes 1,000,000s of transactions on the Bitcoin Network(tm) and rather would have them done on the Visa or Mastercard networks which apparently can handle this sort of thing on an hourly basis.
If that doesn't work we'll have to resort to pitch forks and torches.

i don't think it is abuse, i want to see the results of this as a user. perhaps there are better options out there.
@_date: 2015-09-06 06:05:16
i assure you that Mastercard and Visa will add servers on the fly to take all your 25 cent transaction fees... give it a try my friend
@_date: 2015-09-07 18:15:32
bad analogy... anyone who is willing to pay can play buddy...  winning miners just need to prioritize based on economic incentive... capitalism works! :)

sadly bitcoin has a very minimal amount of QA from what i recall Gavin complaining about the other year.
but you know how it is with software... esp open source... people don't want to fix stuff until they get egg on their face.
and since there is no real company or decision making or management structure, stuff like this type of thing will happen over and over again, people better learn to accept it as part of the process that improves performance

yes we have something like this in San Francisco the last friday of every month called Critical Mass...
perhaps the coinwallet folks should rebrand this as Critical Transactions
@_date: 2015-09-06 05:41:17
don't be an idiot... paying a higher miners fee should prioritize your transactions...
these are not transaction attacks, this is like taking a car out to drive and seeing how fast it can drive.
please iron out your panties.
@_date: 2015-09-06 05:49:25
are you saying i can't test the top speed of a car on the autobahn??
last time i checked, we could...
@_date: 2015-09-06 06:16:46
who says these transaction requests are not authorized?  is there some authority that must stamp transactions as authorized or unauthorized?
@_date: 2015-09-06 05:50:01


wait seriously? what have you guys been doing the last 5 years?  don't you know the halvings happen every few years and the entire point of that is to develop a fee market...
dear mother of... this group of dev's need at least one person with the brain of a product manager before you all are left with no more faces to spike and feet to shoot or noses to cut off...

i dunno first time i read about bitcoin i knew it would one day hit $1000... then possibly $10k ... though lately it looks like some Jerry Springer shit show of white trash baby mama drama
@_date: 2017-05-04 21:17:22
yea thats like what 10%? he can make that washing a few cars

who knows probably just crazy but it's funny to read if you are bored... never met the guy so who really knows...

the question is about mass adoption, not specific use cases.
something like 70% of the world's adult population has less than 10000$ in assets so they do not have much value to store in the first place to even think much about it, but even a gold ring is something.  i'm not sure how many of the remaining 30% with above 10000$ in assets have some gold in their portfolio, but probably more than who own pieces of art as stores of value.
After all walking around with an Andy Warhol or Chagall in a war zone is not going to work out to well.

long term capital gains tax is usually around 10% last i checked Trump aint raising that lol
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:05:24
i'm not sure but i do know that for example in the RSK technology which is kind of similar, and also the Cosmos technology there is a need for reputable members to sort of look over transactions, hence why they both need what they call "federates" to sign off on transactions. So that could be a legit issue... at least it was when we spoke to the RSK people about what we are doing with WINGS.
I don't unfortunately have a good grasp of how lightning works so I can't say if that logic also applies to it.

for reserve currency the intended audience are banks, not average Joe and Jane. fiat currency however has broad mass market adoption.

for what?
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:03:23
no... colored coins is not the way to go...   after 3 years guess what no one serious is using it.... wonder why?
i would explain to you but i'm guessing it would be like talking to a tree.

lesson here is to have a separate phone for 2fa... you are probably going to need to hire an attorney or something to get their attention... g/l
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:04:00
are you sure about that...

I run the communications for Mastercoin, if someone is spreading FUD, please let me know and I will have a talk with them...
@_date: 2013-12-25 18:53:51
The pollution issue with simple sends in the mastercoin protocol is being addressed with an approved pull request for bitcoin v0.9.  
@_date: 2013-12-11 02:16:18
FYI just make sure you use a QT or blockchain.info wallet address
