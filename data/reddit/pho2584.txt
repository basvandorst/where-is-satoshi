Here is their statement: 
From what I gathered, they have access to the BCH automatically generated, but aren't allowing users to have access as they are not supporting it, to put it bluntly. Feel free to correct me if I misinterpreted. Edit: grammar
Edit 2: Just recieved an email from coinbase, I'll quote the relevant paragraph.


1.	Both bitcoin and bitcoin cash remain safely stored on Coinbase. 
2.	Customers with balances of bitcoin at the time of the fork now have an equal quantity of bitcoin cash stored by Coinbase. 
3.	We operate by the general principle that our customers should benefit to the greatest extent possible from hard forks or other unexpected events.
Over the last several days, we’ve examined all of the relevant issues and have decided to work on adding support for bitcoin cash for Coinbase customers. We made this decision based on factors such as the security of the network, customer demand, trading volumes, and regulatory considerations.

Call me ignorant and you would be correct, because I did not move my savings from coinbase before the fork. Would it be safe to assume that the BCH I "own" is now non-accessible to me, even if I change wallets?
