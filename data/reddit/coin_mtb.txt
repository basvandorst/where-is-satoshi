My pet theory is that Bitcoin has been trending down to bring all the alt-coins down. Then, soon, Bitcoin goes to Mars and alt coins stay on earth. Also, when capital flees the overbought stock market and weakening dollar, more fuel for trip to Mars. Hodl and buy!

Freudian slip at the end...he called it a “currency” then quickly switched to “store of value.” 
Someday Bitcoin will truly be both.

With every. single. story. about Bitcoin on Bloomberg, it seems as if the professional TV folks literally forget how to speak—with their words. Go watch/listen again.

All the major alt-coins are at lower 24 hour % losses than bitcoin--just compare on cryptowatch. This trend has been true for a few days now. I believe this crash is to actually bring down all the tag-along alt coins. Then bitcoin goes up big again and the alts do not because IMHO alts have little real-world use.
