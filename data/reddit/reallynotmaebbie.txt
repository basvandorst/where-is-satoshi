if you use gocoin it is easy to set up, the buyer can then decide what to pay with.

they will have its uses, clinging to one coin won't work out for businesses. Users can propably get away with using only one coin.

the litecoin community is activly supporting an ecosystem with many currencies, it is which repeateadly censors any post mentioning anything besides Bitcoin.
only really hates premined coins like ripple, which is still better than which just hates everything not bitcoin.

i wonder, namecoin can be mined alongside bitcoin very easily though, since it is essentialy a fork with improvements.

it is much harder to archive high hasrates using scrypt hardware. That is the reason why the hasrate looks so small compared to bitcoins and namecoins algorithm.
Although even with that factored out litecoin is still way below bitcoin in terms of mining power put into mining.
