I do use it. If you know how to make paper wallet, and redeem safely, redundancy is cheaper. Plus not putting all my bitcoin in one basket feels safer.

I have a hardware wallet. It is really difficult to support a generalization like, "Crypto has moved on form paper wallets." Paper wallets are still the best option for deep cold storage because of the technical needs for redeeming you noted.

Yea, I think mine might have enough room for another 2 years or so. We will see how optimization goes over the mid-term. No, I was not really concerned about a pre-owned latitude 2120. I suppose that is a security weak point, but seems a bit excessive to me. What are you imagining would be the most problematic from utilizing pre-owned device? Hard malware that transmits my data?

I have read through those. I guess my meaning was a "hardware deployment" still seems rather complicated compared to starting a LND instance, or a full node. If I already have a computer with LND and node, why is it so complicated to connect that to BTCPay server?

no, a wallet implies you have to control your private keys. It implies you are in sole responsibility of your keys, and no one can change your bitcoins to Bcoinsegwit2x alt coins. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 14:28:17
So I am misguided when I think [BIP148]( was the more likely cause of activation. Also, wasn't NYA supposed to prevent a chain split? Yet we have Bcash now. Why are we trying to hardfork again within such a short time? What is so urgently needed that S2X would provide?
