Maybe it's a bit hard to use Paypal when credit cards are not working?

So what?  Register bitcointalking.eu and start your own forum if bitcointalk.org doesn't suit you

"The next few days are critical"
@_date: 2014-04-07 13:27:33
But whats the best approach for "being prepared" if you think you could buy at a certain price some days away for example ? Then you must have som EUR or USD at the exchange right?

" saw very very few indications or posts that suggested bankruptcy (it was the world's most popular exchange)"
Except for them getting hacked once already, and having very slow or halted withdrawal options...

Ok, thx :)
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:58:01
So what is the definition of an altcoin ? Would it be possible to circumvent it by altering mining algorithms, volume or similair?

Hm, I don't understand the part about printed files. who could some one get hold of old printed files? Aren't those removed from the computer?
@_date: 2014-01-11 12:05:05
Did you  use a software made for design  designing this or just something like Photoshop?

Thank you :)

What about litecoins and other altcoins? If you trade XBT-&gt;LTC for example , what happens to the value ?
@_date: 2014-11-13 06:19:51
thx :D

This is by far the coolest thing about BTC, enabling a decentralised money transfering system which could be used without ID  and just a cell phone.
Some kind of bitcoin startup in Kenya would be so cool to work for!

This is a late reply, but do you know if those tshirts can be ordered online and where ?
@_date: 2014-11-18 13:01:52
Yeah I like Kraken too, fast fiat transfers and good availabilty
@_date: 2014-11-24 21:22:31
I don't get it why Wikipedia just doesn't post a bitcoin adress where you can transfer the money to. Now(or some while ago) you needed to register in some way and THEN you could pay with bitcoins

A huge advantage is for "average immigrants" that doens't have a bank account in the country they live in. They could just use the bitcoin network for money transfers to send money home within a couple of minutes.
@_date: 2015-05-29 20:34:46
so sad :(
@_date: 2014-04-07 08:35:24
But how can they not have automated monitoring over their servers and react 24/7 ?
@_date: 2014-11-12 22:11:16
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:00:57
What, this sounds crazy. What would be the motivation for that ?

lol that was mentioned in a askreddit thread with the title "worst feeling ever" or something :P
@_date: 2015-01-31 12:36:39
A lot of things(forums, e-commerce, twitter clients etc) already exists in any given language,  but I don't see the argument that one more isn't necessary. Then you can avoid pitfalls of previous versions

Maybe they didn't forsee the "Reddit CEO will piss of million of users that will start to use our service in 24h"-scenario...
@_date: 2015-07-05 18:59:41
