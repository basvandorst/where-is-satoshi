Unfortunately, not this time.

Still waiting on this! :)

So what do you guys think? 
Market correction soon?

What does a buy wall mean? 
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:27:33
I don't know why I expected it to be in English
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:36:42
I would use it.
But not without feeling insecure about the volatility. 
The fees Amazon and Ebay charge are fucking ridiculous and it's only a matter of time before those fees drastically reduce.

Even after your first purchase?!

SHHH DONT TELL EVERYONE ELSE! 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:04:30
I agree. It's a great time to buy
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:37:57
I see, but with a large enough investment you could theoretically still make a decent amount of money in the short-term with not as much risk (assuming the price doesn't tank between the time it takes you to buy and sell) 
For example, Buy $50k of bitcoin on a different exchange for 400 a piece and then sell it on Mt. Gox for 450 a piece. You'll just have a to wait a few few weeks before the withdrawal goes through and the money arrives in your checking account. 
Is this correct? I'm not too familiar with the system and so I'm probably overlooking something..

Wait, could you explain this to me? 
Where can I watch the buy/sell orders? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:07:00
What was the game plan and how did you deviate? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:27:04
SERIOUSLY. 
I have $8k ready to go but I'm waiting for my first buy on CoinBase to go through.. Just put it in this morning for a small amount. ETA 4 fucking DAYS. 
Late adopter but how quickly can I trade BTC after the first buy goes through? It's instant right?

I've always wondered why people don't do this.
What exactly is the reason for this?
