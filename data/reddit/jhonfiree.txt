For Example: 
SearchTrade makes all its payments in Bitcoin. Since this is a relatively new currency, there are a lot of half-truths and whole lies surrounding it. So let’s just sort through all of it quickly, so that that you can get a better idea of how this currency functions and where it is headed.
The money that we use on a day to day basis is controlled by our country’s financial governing body which means that if there is an economic crisis, such as the 2007-2009 recessions in the US, the value of your money will fall drastically. Unlike most currencies, Bitcoin is not controlled by any governing body and instead it works on the principle of consensus. Every transaction made within the Bitcoin system is recorded and this record is shared with everyone in the system. If a person tampers with the record, his version will be different from the majority of people in the system and so it will not be accepted. At this point, you might wonder what would happen if a person managed to convince the majority of users to accept an incorrect record. This would be a valid concern if the system consisted of just 10 or 20 people but Bitcoin now has over 4 million users – and is still rapidly growing! It is this independence and decentralization that gives Bitcoin its stability.
Bitcoin is a virtual currency which means that it does not exist in the form of notes and coins like the money that we are used to spending on a daily basis. However, you can exchange it for the currency of your choice at a foreign exchange office or you can use it to buy everyday items as long as the seller accepts Bitcoin.
