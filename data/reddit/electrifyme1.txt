Many reports are saying the bottom could be around 3500 per bitcoin. We need to turn around now or it's over. Who believes in reports though? I predict bitcoin will go up or down from this point. I'm always 100&amp; right.

People have been saying that since bitcoin was 20k. You want newer coins. Check out elec, it's on a nice dip also was just at 70 mill marketcap a month ago so it's not made it's bull run yet.

@_date: 2019-08-22 00:42:13
Change your mind about bitcoin. hmm. Well, if people don't buy then it's worthless, it has no value unless other people buy it. Does not make money, interest , dividends or anything. Get in low and sell high and yeah you can spend it but you just need to get in lower then the rest. I know the federal reserve is a huge scam and can print all they want but the only value in bitcoin is if the ponzi grows and you get more in. Sorry but that's all it is. Prove me wrong. Buying bitcoin is like buying 100 dollar bill and having it worth 50 dollars in a month. That's not cool . If it goes up we are all happy but they have no product, no company and no income. Sadly it is a ponzi scheme no doubt.

Pretty good. I'm guessing you are making fun of all the youtubers that will talk like that then shill some crap coin their friends and them are already invested in so they can dump all over their followers? See you were almost perfect. Invest in my new coin, I've been working on it and it's much better then bitcoin. It's called Stealyourmoney coin. Remember the youtube scammers that would con people in to signing up under them for referrals? All those bitconnect clone sites and basically anything that had a referral link. I really think there was one called Poopcoin. Not one of their followers made a dime and just funding the youtuber.

DING DING DING! I think you provided the perfect and truthful answer. I do still get hurt if I did make a lot of profit and did not sell and lost it all back on some coins but you are correct, if I bought in and am still even or ahead I guess technically I have not lost any of my investment/gambling money yet. When it drops under my initial investment then I'm losing money if I sell or not.

To this day after years I'm still confused about bitcoin. The only way it goes up is when more people buy it, just like everything else.

Final thoughts about all the people saying to hodl and you lost nothing until you sell. I bet that's what you tell your friends when the market is down but when it goes up and you profited 10k I bet you tell them you made 10k. So technically you only made 10k if you sold it so you would then not be a hodler. I actually have a friend like this and he will also not admit the black panthers are a racist group. Guess that's the mindset.
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:22:01
I have never met a person in my life who loses money and says, no big deal. Maybe if they already have millions and lost 10k then yeah but anyone who works for their money would not be comfortable losing a dime.  
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:25:47
I was many people saying that when it dropped from 20k to 15k. It's all a gamble and a guess. You could buy now or hope it hits 1000 then buy and then it could drop to 100. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:51:53
Most stores of value won't drop over 50 percent in a year. You lost me. If I put 50 dollars in a safer and open it in a year it's still going to be 50 dollars. Would stuck to put a 50 dollar bill in the safe then open it to see a 25 dollar bill.

Bitcoin Price Drops Below $6,000 for First Time in Months as $13bn Wiped off Markets
The cryptocurrency ecosystem is currently going through a red day as most top cryptocurrencies are taking a hit, with some dropping over 20% in the last 24-hours. The cause behind the massive downswing is, at press time, unclear.   I have done my research and figured it out. 13 billion worth of bitcoin was sold so the price dropped, it's pretty clear. Now what I don't understand is why all these coins where guys sit on the forums and youtube talking about how great their fundamentals are go down with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:08:32
This is the end.
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:40:15
find an alt coin that is almost so low,has some fundamentals that it can't really go much lower :) I'm in one that has a 3 million market cap and is actually not a S coin, they are just not on a ton of markets yet but have major partners. You will never make your money back in bitcoin. A ten X in a 3 million cap is a lot more reasonable then a ten X then a ten X in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-15 06:05:55
I've never figured it out in the real stock market or crypto. Everything dropped. So basically if I buy and alt coin I don't even have to look at its fundamentals and just hope bitcoin goes up? I remember in stocks when Intel went down AMD would go down. Should be the other way around, they are competitors. Amd should have went up if Intel was losing money. Many of us made or lost money in crypto and the market but in the end I think stocks and crypto are both scams. We are not investing we are gambling. Pretty sure the guy who made bitcoin is already rich and retired for life somewhere. The only guys that really got rich in bitcoin mined it years ago, bought massive amounts at 10 dollars and held it. They are the ones yelling at people to keep holding so they can sell more for massive gains. A friend got in to Eth at 1 dollar. He won't lose a penny of his initial investment unless it goes under 1 dollar. He's probably already cashed out a few hundred k.
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:50:46
Not to sure about that. My ten dollar bill has always been worth 10 dollars. I never woke up one day and found out it was only worth 8 dollars.
@_date: 2018-11-16 08:51:04
You put it on a bitpay card. Has a visa logo so for all other bills, food items I use the card for the mortgage I have to withdraw cash off the card and toss it in the bank. Not really that hard. If you want to use cash just take it out of the atm. Think you can hold around 30k on the card. So to me bitcoin is money. Sometimes it can take around an hour when you are sending bitcoin to your card, does not take days or weeks. Card loaded, go buy stuff.

If you pay tax when selling your bitcoins you are doing it wrong. I never used my real name or address on any trading site. I try to do that everyone in life, the minute someone gets your info they can sell it and also the government can come in and get ya. Governments love money more then GODS. I just send bitcoin to a bitpay card with a visa logo and spend, can withdraw cash from atms or just buy stuff online or local with it. How did the money get on my card? It was a gift from some random named guy I made it. You are welcome.
@_date: 2018-11-15 06:11:04
I am an expert. I have studied the market recently and I have came to the conclusion that the price has dropped a lot.
@_date: 2018-11-16 09:13:23
The corrupt banksters and governments will control bitcoin anyway. I'm not a fan of this stuff other then trying to make money. My friend is all about the technology and garbage but If people invest a lot into a lot of things odds are many have been scammed or coins vanished. Can you call the cops or the FBI? They don't care and would not find it anyway. I've been scammed and robbed in my life but never as much as in crypto. I believe the dollar based currency will collapse someday but we trade our bitcoin for USD so what's the point? If the dollar becomes worthless then so will bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-16 09:33:38
It can never be a true money system. You could go to bed with 100k in your bitcoin bank and wake up with 50k the next day. It's like using a stock as a currency. It could happen but I doubt you could have 100k in your real bank and wake up with it only worth 50k. IF that happens it's world wide depression. If the dollar collapses it will pull bitcoin down with it. Heard stories about people pushing wheel barrows full of money just to buy food. We had a lot less people in the world back then so this next one is going to kill most of us. I have enough canned food and water to survive maybe a month. Then what? Go out and hunt animals for food? Where, I live in a city as most of us do. The crazy old mountain men and the rich will survive. It's already happening in a few countries, they just weigh the paper money because it's worthless. I think that's a sign. I don't see anything put in place to stop another world wide depression then of course we will get WW III right after that. Our planet is over populated.

People invested money, it works the same as a ponzi scheme. When the money stops coming in and the people start cashing out the price goes down. The only value it holds depends on how much money people put in. The guys that got in earlier will profit and everyone after that will lose it all.

Well then I guess you don't make money either unless you sell and spend it. So if someone invested 10k in bitcoin and now has 5k they lost nothing? I don't remember much from grade school but I think that's a loss. Example, say you wanted to use that 10k to buy something but wait! It's 5k and you still think you lost nothing?
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:36:51

Maybe it's just me but I don't hodl. To scary. Imagine if people did that when bitcoin was around even 15k and Neo was almost 200 dollars. That's not coming back if it does it will be a very long time. When I saw neo down at 14 which I thought I would never see again I thought about it and now it's 9 dollars. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:57:35
So you have been wrong for a year? What's the point? Hey, I will go out and say 10 dollars. I think to many people got burned in crypto to want to enter it again. I've been scammed many times.  Made some quick money on certain icos and scammed on many others. After seeing how risky the scams are I just stopped and would not invest in an ICO if they said they were backed by apple. Some of them actually carry it to market and are on multiple trading sites but I have not seen my coins and it's been a year so doubt they will ever send them. Some that mentioned nothing of KYC when I bought now want a photo ID and passport. So you already stole my money and now you want to steal my identity as well? No thanks, keep the money.

Best way is to use a bitpay visa card. Takes your crypto and adds it to the card, basically as USD. So bitcoin could go down 50% or up 50% but your card still holds the same value. Can use it anywhere that takes Visa, even get cash back from an ATM. I really think half of the people here don't even hold bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:02:22

I think BTC burned so many people that all flooded in on the 20k run that there is no chance they would ever come back even if they did have some money left. Whoever made up Hodling was a genius. I bet many have hodled from 3k to 20k then back down again. In the end they will lose money. I learned my lesson a long time ago. If someone shoots up get the hell out or Hodl it and ride it all the way back down.

The scams are coming to and end, taking their money and running.

I'm trying to figure out if these guys are just trolling or not? I do have a friend that believes in the stupidity. He tells me the same thing, He's lost nothing because he's not selling. If you put 10k in and it's now 3k then you lost 7k. Basic math. I bet this is what you tell your friends and they probably laugh behind your back. I bet when bitcoin goes up and you don't sell you still tell your friends you made a good profit that day.
