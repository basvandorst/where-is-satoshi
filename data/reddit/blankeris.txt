i'm no tax expert but in the US long term capital gains (holdings longer then a year) are taxed between 0-20% depending on your income. the taxable amount is the difference of value between when it was acquired to when it was sold. if she is an average income earner, probably 15%.

Futures contracts effectively create an unlimited supply of "paper bitcoin" by allowing market participants to speculate on the price movement alone. Futures are settled in cash (not btc), eliminating the need to actually hold bitcoin.

Bitmain has interests in seeing bitcoin fail. Jihan Wu, founder of bitmain, is a huge supporter of bitcoin cash and hostile towards bitcoin.

Assuming you're on windows, I would check the recycle bin folder first. There are utilities that you can run that restore deleted files. When you delete a file it doesn't actually "delete it" it just marks it as deleted until those sectors are overwritten.  I would just google restore deleted file utility and see what's available. The password may be trickier, hopefully its something you can recall or perhaps there is no password on your wallet.

get a hardware wallet, ledger or trezor. write your seed words down, keep them safe, and never type them into a computer.
@_date: 2019-04-07 14:13:50
gemini but fees are higher.
@_date: 2019-09-25 18:52:50
how much?

yeah that's interesting.. i think it has to do with that block being found so quickly.

cool story bro
@_date: 2019-05-22 14:30:26
takeaway: make it as easy as it is to use as a dollar in the vending machine, that's when you'll see mass adoption.
@_date: 2019-05-31 16:04:16
Zero reason to be scared if you have your seed words
@_date: 2019-05-09 20:08:26
It's not wallet maker specific, the standard is BIP39. Both ledger and trezor use it. Software wallets use the same standard.
Hardware wallets benefit is they prevent your key from leaving the device in plaintext.
It doesn't matter if it breaks or ledger goes out business, as long as you have your seed words you can recover your funds.
@_date: 2019-05-11 21:19:17
Extremely unlikely, everyone is going to want to BTFD now. You had months to buy at 4k.

I predict John Mcafee will lose his bet, but won't actually self masticate his manhood.

Why send to the Samurai at all? 
Wipe the ledger, get the new seed words/address, restore ledger and send to new address. Then restore to the new words.
@_date: 2019-05-29 01:49:29
Yep, subtle dig at bcash

looks like we're painting a bull flag, price is condensing. i should qualify that I could be totally wrong though and it could just as easily go the other way. i just think a massive move is coming.

some linux background would help but it's probably not required.
Looks through the guide and see if its something you're comfortable with.

Go for 2.1 btc. You can control 0.00001% (one millionth) of the btc supply.

what if it's.......... already priced in
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:18:56
I would DCA instead of sinking it all in at once, nobody knows where its going. It could bust up to 8k or retrace to 4k. We are at a big resistance level so most people are assuming it will get rejected around this level.

i'm running lightning (lnd) and a bitcoind on a raspberry pi. 
i was getting a lot of messages like:
 socket recv error Connection reset by peer (104)
in the bitcoind debug log. I restarted bitcoind and loaded Greg Maxwell's banlist and they stopped. It seems likely that I may have been getting DOS'd by some bad actors.
