Remember when people were complaining that $100 was too high for Bitcoin? Then it went to $1,000. Remember when it dipped back down to $350 and everyone thought Bitcoin was dead? Then it went to $20,000. Remember that time it dipped to $8,000? Oh yea, that's right now.﻿

FOMO stands for "Fear of Missing Out" and a FOMO trade is simply a trade you enter out of fear of missing the move. When a stock experiences sudden volatility, it can make some traders very anxious.

Are people not seeing that this is all a massively blatant crypto manipulation pump (mid nov - mid dec) and dump (mid dec - mid feb) being done by institutional money? The created dip isn't over just yet (~10 more days) while the big money is buying all the way down to load up as much as they can during the dip they are creating (Mid Dec - Mid Feb, coordinated dumps + FUD) using the money they got from pumping the market and selling at the top just a few weeks prior (Mid Nov - Mid Dec, coordinated pump + lack of FUD)...
Long story short this created downtrend is likely to turn around like clockwork in mid Feb (~Feb 14) and the same manipulators will ride the wave again back up, with a much larger position they then had in the past, with no additional capitol cost to them... Think chess, not checkers!
Mid Feb = ~4.6k low
Late Feb = ~13k high
Late March = ~20k high
Late April = ~28k high
Late May = ~35k high
Late June = ~40k high﻿

Cryptocurrencies have taken over my life in the past 4 months. What people need to realise is that there is no crash in bitcoin and has never been, just consolidation getting ready for a new all time high! Its all FUD to try and Keep people in the dollar, it has real use cases that are better than any dollar﻿

If you are hoping that the bitcoin to correct further to $7k , $6k or even $5k so that you can buy it , i am afraid to say that you may have to wait till the next crash maybe in Jan’2019 , by then , probably the banks and Warren Buffet will join you . 
As for now , Bitcoin is set to climb back steadily to $12k , dip a little , then to $15k , dip a little again , then to $18k , and dip a little again , then it will rocket all the way to $28k . 
Wait no longer , now its the time .﻿
