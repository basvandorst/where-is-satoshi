Just because some dudes said something some time ago, does not make it a law. This ain't Scientology.

I love the alternate logo. Finally up to par with Dogecoin awesomeness. Seriously, readability for print, screen, low-res fax is paramount in communication design, just my opinion.

Ƀ readability from an UX and Communication Science standpoint is beyond the limited dimensia of the old symbol. It's a great analogy of the narrow mindedness of BitCoiners, depicted nicely in their attitude towards altcoins.

Agree, I am a bit exxagurating since I predicted this 3 months ago (proof in the Dojo). I also agree that it will be most likely a slow drain. Oh don't we all miss the smell of the good ol panic sell of the old days. Long sentence short the fact that $420 did not hold and issue a large bounce can't be emphasised enough, $200 on Stamp (=$266 MtGox RIP) might be possible. Focus is on $305 for now, I expect an epic bounce.

So true. Fuck TV. Relict of the past. Only a matter of years now until they are 100% extinct. ( i know I worked at RTL)

Thanks for making me never visit Business Insider again in the future. What a bunch of morons.

Please take down the mirror for a second and stop swearing at yourself, I'm sure there will come better days lol :)

$80 down since I posted it. How's that long coming along?
@_date: 2015-11-05 05:03:35
Link corrected, sorry for that. Btw, Price has fallen $50 since post, 10 minutes ago.

Its too complex to explain in a sentence. Its basically called programming and technical analysis combined. Those are buy/sell signals, trendlines, indicators, Medians, Stochastics and much more. Heres my Ref Link for BFX -

Zoom out to Weekly, look at where we went vertical, at RSI @ 68. Now look where weekly RSI is now. (analysis courtesy of Rustam)

You have to search under the HongKong Edition, they are planning to open the first setup at Xidan. Think of 汉堡王, who also went live there.

If subway does it, why can't Burger King? It's only logical.

Price already reacted to this. Seems to be huge.
