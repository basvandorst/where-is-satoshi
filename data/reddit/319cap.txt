Just show to them and people like me why bitcoin would be betfer with segwit. We have lots and lots of btc and clearly dont want it hurt. Keep in mind our standards reflect our investments.
@_date: 2017-02-21 12:51:13
I thought you did not need them? Can you just publish?
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:44:49
Well I see you have been around since atleast.2011 :)
@_date: 2017-02-03 00:16:24
Not sure. If I could take $100,000 now I would be worried someone else would take that $100,000 before I could take that million on BTC maybe sometime...
@_date: 2017-02-21 07:44:40
Hope I dont miss it...
@_date: 2017-02-21 08:02:22
Dont have twitter :/    loooking forward to it though. Eta?
@_date: 2017-02-11 03:13:14
Trump has done PR stunts where he takes gold over USD as a payment and calls the gold "sound money". I would not say he "loves the USD". 
I really do not think the BTC community understand how libertarian he is when it comes to money and the governments relations with personal wealth. Like him or not Trump might be the best thing for BTC. Just look at his pro BTC staff.

LN will be rewritten to work with out segwit and they seem to be aware of this and do not care one way or the other about it. 
They just don't like segwit. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 07:32:19
Mined for free....
@_date: 2017-02-02 03:08:02
He made a claim but did not back it up.... 
@_date: 2017-02-03 00:09:52
Was there. The miners do not want segwit.
@_date: 2017-02-03 00:22:21
Im glad you do not mine.
@_date: 2017-02-09 03:48:40
Other big established operations are signing up to help make the etf work correctly.
@_date: 2017-02-03 03:30:26
Thie miners are okay with doing nothing for now more or less and so am I.
Also I could careless what users want. This is bitcoin and this was how it was designed when I started.
@_date: 2017-02-23 15:22:48
The founding fathers stopped FDR from being elected 4 times? Damn.... Good thing right? 
@_date: 2017-02-03 17:23:47
How can we know when it is ready?
@_date: 2017-02-23 06:12:09
Why so few?
@_date: 2017-02-21 16:25:57
I want them :)
@_date: 2017-02-05 16:34:19
He said he has other stuff running and guessed at how much it was using...
@_date: 2017-02-21 07:34:02
I want this!   Let me know how! Have vive!
@_date: 2017-02-11 23:42:43
Well if that is what the media told you then I'm sure it is correct... There is no way I could have a better view of this than you... 
@_date: 2017-02-08 00:17:51
When did it leave? They also have a section in their forum for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-21 01:43:45
Buying in the US... Yeah, it's not like they can buy in China.... And since they are not selling in China....
@_date: 2017-02-01 22:46:06
All of them...
@_date: 2017-02-08 08:27:18
Oh okay. API error maybe.
@_date: 2017-02-21 15:10:42
There is no way you can let me trying it without the permission of steam? That is insane!
@_date: 2017-02-03 00:10:52
LTC has real value.
@_date: 2017-02-09 04:14:48
Yeah it is BS
@_date: 2017-02-14 01:24:55
All of it...
@_date: 2017-02-04 04:17:37
yeah I don't do that sorry, I will just search steam for bitcoin from time to time. that will work?
@_date: 2017-01-30 19:17:03
I was there and do not agree with that 99 percent number. Maybe 5 people said they wanted it, most just wanted the drama to end. 
To further point out the 99 number is BS both Ver and friends and the miners were not for it. 
Just clearing up FUD...
@_date: 2017-01-24 19:12:47
Reported for spam
@_date: 2017-01-14 09:13:55
Do you know who the thief is if you know they are free? Can I ask what the trial will be about then if not theft? Thx
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:29:49
They quit btc so.....
@_date: 2017-01-14 15:05:19
Yeah I could see that based on the mixing of the personal and public accounts. Thanks for the time. By the way we last spoke in earlly 2011, crazy how things have changed.
@_date: 2017-01-19 00:59:10
Why not just lock it? Why edit it?
@_date: 2017-01-27 00:37:10
Much of the event was whining....
@_date: 2017-01-09 15:56:17
@_date: 2017-01-19 01:57:20
I get that this is a joke but he did edit the thread and Im not sure why. I get the locking and banning but removing a post that follows the rules seems counter productive. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 14:58:27
@_date: 2017-01-14 08:24:22
For theft? Interesting. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 01:00:59
Was jail worth all the XBT you hid away? Bet it was lol! How is the high life? 
@_date: 2017-01-14 01:32:56
So there will be a trail? If true seems fair enough.
@_date: 2017-01-21 18:26:35
I'm sure thermos was the one who approved this knowing him... Scamers all hang out together :/
He has been collecting bribe money for adverts for ages from them. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 12:45:25
You are right and exactly what many miners want.
@_date: 2017-01-19 21:18:36
Why would I shoot you?
@_date: 2017-01-31 18:17:55
I have no idea how he got 99 percent as I was not one and there was less than 50 people in that room...
@_date: 2017-01-26 19:10:29
How many bitcoin lambos are out there now?
@_date: 2017-01-19 04:07:51
Yeah... Just because I question mods censoring for no valid reason you assume I'm pro rBTC. That is just silly... I guess I should fall back in line and never question authority again as after all is that not what bitcoin is really about?
@_date: 2017-01-04 16:51:22
Pretty sure he was not the only millionaire in 2013. It only took 1,000 XBT. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:51:26
Umm... giving away the fees is a good start and shows they are not the ones spammming.
@_date: 2017-01-16 01:08:50
People who want that tech will move to LTC as it is tbe best chain with it.
@_date: 2017-01-20 00:02:00
If you can find a way to go back in time 7 years or more.
@_date: 2017-01-12 13:02:55
Well half your name is right
@_date: 2017-01-26 18:57:46
I wish more people got that.
@_date: 2017-01-27 00:19:00
@_date: 2017-01-26 19:06:27
Odd as only a sadist would use coinbase...
@_date: 2017-01-20 19:22:02
I tried getting gift cards for amazon. Failed and used NE.. Will now shop here first.
@_date: 2017-01-25 17:12:04
@_date: 2017-01-26 19:01:55
Will that kill all the asics?
@_date: 2017-01-27 12:52:17
It is funny but we all really should have known that going in...
@_date: 2017-01-19 02:34:53
But it was locked...
@_date: 2017-01-12 02:24:08
Well, you are not wrong...
@_date: 2017-01-25 17:11:48
What if the miners are the ones spamming?
@_date: 2017-04-30 02:12:34
Thiel was on the old forum, I talked with him there.
@_date: 2017-04-26 03:13:46
Overstock has issues. They wont give me my $650 refund back after 4 years now!!!
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:27:47
Yes... but we do the second part of the U first then the first part of the U second   ;)
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:25:42
But wait a month and it will be were it was 3 days ago.
@_date: 2017-05-24 08:53:16

@_date: 2017-05-24 02:09:19
@_date: 2017-05-14 08:02:54
Why sell at 1850????  2021 you is just going to have to write more...
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:01:17
Yeah...   did that in 2013 as well when LTC went from 10 cents to $40.....    I ended up with so many BTC...
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:35:13
If the USD was illegal, no one would crime!
@_date: 2017-05-23 06:56:27
