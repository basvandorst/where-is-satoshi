Victimless crime.  Nobody cares.

Thanks.  I hope you haven't felt disrespect from the entire community.  But if so, I apologize, and I hope I can be the first Bitcoin Casher you receive respect from.

Me too.  In fact I drafted a post about that today; I should pull it out, finish it up, and put it up.
Unfortunately most human beings just don't deal well with conflict.  We get ugly and take actions that make for decreased creativity in problem solving as well as destroying potential for collaboration.  Natural irrational impulse of the species, I guess.

We can be friendly competitors.  Here's hoping we all go to the moon.

The rest of us want what is best for Bitcoin/the world, too.  I got into Bitcoin because I believed it could help curtail evil.  I went the non-core route in August because I believe the current core plan is going to hamstring Bitcoin's ability to do that.

Interesting. I said almost exactly the same thing to Charlie Lee on twitter in July.  He made me feel like an ignoramus and like someone who didn't know what he was talking about.
Seeing you say it is very validating, Erik.  Thank you.

I'm a BitcoinCash supporter, and if I really wanted to support BCC I'd encourage everybody NOT to accept 2X so big blockers have nowhere else to go.

Charlie, I might be ignorant, but I don't like being called stupid, and it doesn't endear me to your cause or motivate me to investigate further.
