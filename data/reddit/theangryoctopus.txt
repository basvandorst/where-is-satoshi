I am buying. If you are in the US, contact me. No amount is too low ($5000 USD maximum). Thanks.
@_date: 2014-02-22 05:22:34
Well that's a bit scary. I wonder if it would be more productive to just have a friend open a new account for me and verify. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:00:04
Not sure why anyone would want to buy a Gox account for illicit purposes since it's impossible to get your money out at the moment, But I guess any seller would have to take my word for it on that one. I'll be using it strictly for investment.

Looking to fund my account, not unfund.
@_date: 2014-02-25 01:52:17
2x the price and I still don't have a Gox account to put them in :/
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:03:24
Sooooo you're basically living my dream. Major props having the balls to do this. Best of luck, can't wait to hear more.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:47:19
Woah shit is this new?!

1. 21
2. Compsci student, work in sales
3. I see bitcoin, as a long term alternative to cash due to low fees, decentralization, etc. and am holding out for a long term, admittedly high-risk high gain.
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:47:56
Saw that. Is there really no way for me to get money into my my gox account like there used to be with bit instant?
@_date: 2014-02-22 04:26:22
Oh no kidding? I thought fiat deposits were still active. Their latest update states: The MtGox trading platform and deposits will perform as usual for the needs of our customers.
I haven't heard of anyone having problems with deposits, obviously withdrawals, not deposits.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:52:30
Same boat. Fingers crossed man.
@_date: 2014-02-11 00:30:42
You know it dog 
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:44:55
Man dude I hope you're right. It seems like an unlikely outcome to me at this point, but I'm pulling for you. I bought a bit of Gox BTC on Bitcoinbuilder too, it's hard to resist possible ~10x returns.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:53:04
Ah thanks for the clarification.
@_date: 2014-02-10 22:45:34
Shout out to bitstickers.net! Got all of these  for like eight dollars including shipping from Serbia.
@_date: 2014-02-22 04:52:32
Hey I absolutely will. Thanks for the insight.
@_date: 2014-02-22 04:46:53
Hey, I did but it's only been a day. I don't have too much faith in getting a response considering the circumstances, but hey, worth a shot.
@_date: 2014-02-21 00:40:56
Yeah I guess I'm looking for someone to tell me how to do that and find the number to wire money to and everything.

They're in the Philippines.
@_date: 2014-02-22 04:47:59
Oh that's really interesting. I have used Bitinstant in the past. We're you able to get deposits deactivated?
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:53:36
Will people still mine bitcoins after 2140 when all have been mined? If not, how will transactions take place? Don't miners process transactions through the Blockchain?
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:17:57
Oh! I'm saying that I'll sell you btc for money through PayPal, so really that risk falls on me. the btc transaction is not reversible.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:34:37
Haha, thanks for the advice. I'm actually super-happy with my host, but btc payments would be nice. I'll have to check out namecheap.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:24:08
I wasn't aware. Thanks, and sorry about that.
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:20:02
Oh wow thanks it's 1HRpm1Jvefi46DjX99hSecQFYrwM4ZBsQq
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:02:24
Ah, thanks for pointing that out. Definitely still a bit cumbersome, and definitely a bummer that I still have to be logged in to Coinbase.
I'll throw something together and post back here with an App Store link in a few days.
@_date: 2013-10-23 16:25:42
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:10:59
Looks like you made your first Bitcoin sale! Can't wait to try the tea!
@_date: 2013-12-17 07:30:24
Orange County, CA here. 3btc over the last 7 days. Bummer indeed. And I'm only 4% over bitstamp.
