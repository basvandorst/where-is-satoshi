You know what, I'm not going to get into this debate again. 
If you're incapable of accepting that most sex escorts were in no way conned, tricked, forced or coerced into being sex escorts, no amount of proof will change your mind.

I know, sometimes I forget that all sex workers were forced into sex work by the patriarchy.

That's  an appeal to emotion fallacy.  Also, what about MALE sex workers? (If you say the're all gay, I'm going to scream)


That's insulting to their intelligence. 


Yes, because if someone chooses to be a sex worker, they MUST have been abused/molested/neglected as a child.

Far more than 72% of sex workers chose to be sex workers.
EDIT: Yeah, this sounded far less creepy when I wrote it. Also it's way higher than that.

Yes. Yes a quatrodecillion times. This is EXACTLY what we need.

Crap, sorry.

Navigating the pixel won't do anything, you need to input the haptic SSL hard drive.

Well, I would kill myself, but that might interfere with me seeing the next episode of Person of Interest. Sorry! Maybe if The Doctor is ever angry at me, I might reconsider.
