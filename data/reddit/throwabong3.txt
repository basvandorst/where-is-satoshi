lol yeah right

My understanding is they don't like core because bitcoin will be a settlement network surrounded by a number of payment networks like thunder network that'll look like Liberty Reserve lookalike spokes. Therefore fees will be low on these payment networks because they'll be relatively decentralized. The bitcoin settlement network meanwhile will remain sufficiently decentralized and coinbase will just be enabling a number of competing decentralized payment networks and spelling its own doom no matter how much VC funding gets pumped into it and regulatory compliance it specialises in. What do you find wrong with my understanding?

you mean like state-funded banks, credit cards, the white house page, and all the DOJ pages hacked to pieces by anonymous?
looks like ''insurance and oversight'' has only meant the pages have become less secure as the losses have been centralized in institutions that are happy to socialise them!!

What part of requiring bitcoin remaining decentralized do you not understand?
And why should coinbase care if all it is is a broker, it can just use one of the payment channels on lightning or thunder later on down the road.
If coinbase can't tell the difference between POS and POW, then it doesn't understand decentralization. I'm not surprised, seeing how important brokers become in a POS system.

So you're arguing with me and you don't even know coinbase has merchant tools and is the middle man for among others expedia? 
and btw, another thing that the decentralization of tiered networks offers is buying and selling btc on decentralized exchanges...

you gonna compare bitcoins marketcap to the pounds marketcap?

coinbase is just a regulated legal government bureaucratically approved exchange, nothing more nothing less. One of the things it doesn't care about is fees any of the cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies it will be moving money have, because it can just switch to another. Another thing it doesn't and shouldn't care about is decentralization.
one of the notions of sidechains or thunder or lightning or whatever is to enable smart contracts and decentralized exchanges. It can't all be done on-chain.

7% went in mtgox... paypal takes 10-80% of every transaction.

Your rhetorical questions you mean? Are your rhetorical questions the only thing going when the core development team might soon be putting payment channels into circulation and coinbase itself is now both a payment channel and a broker, and the payment channels where functionalities from current sidecoins might be implemented might even lead to absence of the need for brokers? Tell me, what makes coinbase, a regulated U.S. exchange deeply concerned for and an expert in decentralization?
@_date: 2016-06-01 23:03:28
So you challenge me on the idea that a decentralized settlement layer would give way to payment channels that challenge coinbase, the paypal of bitcoin, while eventually leading to no fees or less fees like liberty reserve did, and avoid to address why coinbase would care about the lack of decentralization. But I guess I must be the troll then.

i got banned from the ''uncensored'' btc sub for saying DAO was gonna be investing in dicks and orangutans...

Oh so its not that they see thunder network as competition then
@_date: 2016-05-30 11:22:22
no fees
@_date: 2016-05-31 08:32:31
but core's plan is for bitcoin as settlement network, and then the less decentralized sidechains or lightning networks as payment networks, to my understanding. why do you think the issue is not that coinbase doesn't like that notion?
@_date: 2016-05-31 20:15:40
But a sole network with unlimited block size leads to lack of decentralization cuz too few supernodes/miners. If payment networks on thunder or sidechains do the microtransactions then who will buy and sell on coinbase?

Bla bla bla. I thought Brian was busy losing coinbase etc on replays while predicting etc's imminent demise.
