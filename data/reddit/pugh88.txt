You don't understand how markets work.
It fell because someone sold at a price under 19.5k. No-one else was willing to buy at 19.5k, but more sellers wanted to sell their coins. So they were forced to accept a price below 19.5k. 
The same number of people bought / sold at every single price point. 
The price of Bitcoin is simply the price at which the most recent trade occurred. 
It's all good, I used to think in the same way as you. It's an "aha" moment once you get it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:43:34
No, I've thought this too.
Short term: rising price more than compensates for having to pay reasonably high fees when transferring BTC is required. 
Long term: LN or other solution brings fees to near zero.  Rising price increases incentive/capital to build solutions to scaling problem.

Auditor auditor here.
As any accountant knows, any transaction has two balancing entries. When money is deposited, the following accounting occurs: An asset account is debited (cash) and a liability account is credited (deposits). 
The cash ("your money") is on the balance sheet as an asset. It's the bank's asset. The liability isn't the money. A liability is a future obligation of economic outflows, not the cash itself.

Coinjar takes 3 days - would use them. To be honest mate, I'd be more worried about it crashing upward. Worst case scenario, if it dips, just don't sell until it recovers. That 5 BTC will probably be 500k by end of 2018. 
Alternatively, you could register with another exchange (eg hit BTC ), immediately deposit and sell your BTC without verification. Once you have your coinjar set up, then re-buy your BTC at new price on hitBTC, send to coinjar and then cash out. That's if you REALLY want to lock in current price. 
Let me know if that doesn't make sense.

@_date: 2017-12-31 02:55:21
That's my point though. buying and forgetting about it is not a bad idea. Even by traditional investment advice Time horizon should be positively correlated to risk/volatility. Otherwise you're not investing, you're trying to day trade while kidding yourself you're a smart investor. 
If you're not comfortable holding long term, probably not a good idea to buy any at all. 
So often there is news that can be incredibly scary and "certain" portents of doom suggest selling is the best play (eg China banning exchanges at a time when China is 50% volume). If you are watching the market looking for a reason to jump ship you will probably find one. And it will likely cost you. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:49:55
If you've really been in since 400, why is this dip scary for you? Just curious. 
High fees? Well, that's because there is high demand for Bitcoin transactions. The logic of 'too many people are using it so they're going to stop using it' doesn't make sense. But someone that's held since 400 would surely understand this. 
Other coins? Well, Bitcoin is by far the most decentralised network and trust-less network. That's the real 'value add' to normal methods of transferring money/wealth. But someone that's held since 400 would know this.
I don't think you're telling the truth.

Using bitcoin for personal transactions
Generally, there will be no income tax or GST implications if you are not in business or carrying on an enterprise and you simply pay for goods or services in bitcoin (for example, acquiring personal goods or services on the internet using bitcoin).
Where you use bitcoin to purchase goods or services for personal use or consumption, any capital gain or loss from disposal of the bitcoin will be disregarded (as a personal use asset) provided the cost of the bitcoin is $10,000 or less.

Nice, thanks for sharing.
It's interesting to see such an early working example of Bitcoin putting pressure on legacy asset bubbles. Fractional reserves effectively leverage the impact of
every cash withdrawal for the purpose of Bitcoin purchase, causing enormous downward pressure. Hadn't thought about it in this way until your write up.
One concern I have is the legitimacy of the royal commission (the inquiry I think you're referring to). The Libs were famously hesitant to do the commission, and did an about-face only when the bank's asked them to. The last thing the bank's want is a labour instigated commission.
On the other side, I am hopeful that the recent gains in price will have created a decent pro-Bitcoin lobby. All the Bitcoin related companies that have sprung up over the past few years must be in a decent position to make some noise about this, particularly if an adverse result will mean they are out of business. Admittedly, it's no comparison to the power of the banking lobby, but it's something.
I think one of the second tier minor banks needs to take a pro-crypto stance, and together with the new money marketing clout of the exchanges etc, create a new channel for capital flight. Just avoid the big 4 completely.

Basically you've done nothing illegal at all (baring the weed purchase, but that's irrelevant). If you decide to sell your BTC and put the cash in your account, that's fine. You just need to keep a record of how much you've sold it for. 
You'll be taxed on the capital gain you made at your marginal income rate. All your accountant needs is to know the price you bought / sold for. 
However, if you use your BTC to buy products / services directly (rather than just cashing out), there's no tax payable (as long as cost of the Bitcoin is under 10k). 
Also, if you hold your BTC for at least 12 months, it halves any tax payable when you sell. (Which you already have)

Well, I've been thinking about this a fair bit.
So let's say tether is a scam, in the sense that bitfinex creates them at will and doesn't have USD reserves. You can't withdraw USD from bitfinex anyway, as you know, and tether's website states that it cannot be redeemed for USD. 
How then could the scam possibly come to light? There is no obligation on tether/bitfinex for an audit. Bitfinex essentially could be acting as a reserve bank for the Bitcoin economy. Not printing Bitcoin, and inflating it, but printing pseudo-USD to help deflate Bitcoin even quicker. 
Let's say there was, for some unknown reason a mass panic about tether. Everyone can only really sell it for Bitcoin right. So there would be a short term spike in demand for Bitcoin, temporarily increasing price, before the value of tether completely crashes to zero as everyone tries to dump. 
Doesn't change anything about Bitcoin. If it is a scam, I think it's actually helping Bitcoin, not hindering it. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:27:58
Past returns don't equal future returns, true. However, it is also dangerous to assume that bitcoin's past growth has no effect on the present. 
Firstly, early adopters, developers, people that built the early ecosystem, these guys have all been handsomely rewarded for their efforts. The huge growth we have seen means that this group now has a vast amount of capital. What will they do with this capital? Well, I'd wager a lot of it will go towards building even more infrastructure. More infrastructure means more people will know about or be able to buy Bitcoin than they could before. 
Secondly, way more people today know about Bitcoin than they did last year. This means it is far more "real" (inter-subjective reality, for fans of the book Sapiens) that it was before. People knowing about something today means that there is a likelihood, depending on the nature of the information, that even more people will know about it tomorrow. A piece of information like Bitcoin, with its implications for financial sovereignty, a way to get rich, antiestablishment design and so on, is an incredibly attractive piece of information to share with other humans. Each person that finds out about it, particularly if they buy and make money, becomes extremely likely to tell others about it. In marketing speak, they become a net promoter.
So it is quite reasonable to assume that the past growth is an indicator of future growth. Yes, it might not grow, but I see that as far less likely than it continuing to do so. Some new event or unknown information would need to surface for that to happen.

Hey Andreas, thanks for the recent anonymity/privacy talk - your passion for these matters is inspiring. This talk was one of my favourites. 
I had a question about the talk and the point you raised about how it is integral to build privacy into the foundation of a system as it can get very messy and difficult to do this on top. Given there are already  cryptocurrencies with privacy features built in, why not use these? 
I'm guessing the momentum behind Bitcoin is such that it is not possible to simply 'switch' to say, monero? 
Or is it that the way privacy has been engineered in these other cryptos is not sufficiently safe or tested?
Would love to hear your thoughts. No worries if you don't have time to respond (maybe you can slip this into another talk down the line...).
On a personal note, I'm thankful to have a role model such as you in my life  (cheers Internet for making that possible).

Something to bare in mind. While you're right, 100 billion hasn't been spent to buy Bitcoin, a vast amount of capital has been invested in its infrastructure. Mining equipment, websites, developer time etc etc.

G'day mate 
Where you use bitcoin to purchase goods or services for personal use or consumption, any capital gain or loss from disposal of the bitcoin will be disregarded (as a personal use asset) provided the cost of the bitcoin is $10,000 or less.

Ehh not really.
A better comparison would be blockchains are intranets.
What gives the Internet significance over intranets? Consensus.
What gives the Bitcoin blockchain significance over other blockchains?
Internet is a thin protocol, as you say, the value is built on top.
Bitcoin is a fat protocol - the value is in the protocol itself.

Tax offices have some direct data feeds, yes. Tax withholding on income for example. But they do not have data feeds for all components of taxable income (eg capital gains) and they certainly don't have data feeds for deductions.

As more and more users bought, the price would be pushed prohibitively high, preventing the remaining users from buying at the original price. Still cool though.

Of course they can co-exist. Gold, cash and 2x are just alt coins. 
Futures market on the largest exchange by volume already tells us market sentiment for 2x coins. 0.1-0.15. BTC retains the ticker. Whoever has the ticker on the exchanges wins the war.

Can hold Bitcoin, get new tokens from the forks (I like to think of them as dividend payments) and just reinvest into the chain you believe to be bitcoin.

Nothing is ever guaranteed, you're right. I also agree that there will be a degree of "price in" before the fork. However, I also think the uncertainty of the upcoming fork is also priced in. 
No one really knows what is going to happen in November - that uncertainty discourages investment. I would wager that uncertainty is having a bigger impact on price than the potential for receiving new tokens.
Also - if the new tokens are priced in, why was this not the case for BCH? Not only was a new token created, the price of BTC also went up. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 06:05:14
Everyone expected a dip before the bcash split. Didn't happen.
Logically it makes sense to buy as much as possible before the two forks (gold and s2x) so as to have the new tokens for free. Regardless of which chain "wins", you're safeguarded as you own them all.

Before the fork: price increasing as investors look to get fork coins.
After the fork: essentially the end of the multiple year scaling debate. Massive uncertainty removed. Price soars to 10k.

You have to store your wealth somewhere. Some of us feel that leaving our money in an inflationary currency, where value is eroded each year as a certainty, is pretty ridiculous itself.
Bitcoin gives a chance of maintaining value and maybe even increasing in value. That chance isn't 100% but what is 100% certain is that any fiat you hold will devalue over time. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:08:10

I've thought about this a fair bit. If I were an advisor of the president, and was asked "what shall we do about crypto?" Here's what I would say.
We just tax it. Regulated exchanges with KYC (which we already have), see who's buying crypto and give information to the tax authorities. If Bitcoin replaces the financial system, so be it. Government gets Capital Gains Tax revenue whenever that Bitcoin is sold. Government collects tax revenue in Bitcoin. Government financing eventually switches over to bitcoin. Easy.
All bitcoin does is remove monetary policy control from government. Still a great thing.
