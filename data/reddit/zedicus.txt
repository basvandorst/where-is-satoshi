First and foremost thanks for the reply... I realise account recoveries are they least of your priority but i did what i thought would get me my account back and i sent you multiple signed msgs from the btc address associated with my account and i got nothing.. not a single reply.
You said in your post here that


Well let me tell you i did everything i could to protect my user account at bitcointalk.org. I had a 36 char password and i use a text encryption program to encrypt everything i write so as to prevent key-logging. 
**I completely understand** that if your investigation is not thorough, you could end up accidentally "recovering" an account and give it to a thief! That I understand!!
Now you say..


Thats where i loose you completely!! There is **not** a chance in hell that i sold my user account and thats a fact!
 
From my perspective my account was hacked/stolen and then possibly sold to a forum user called "Quickseller". But even that i am unsure of!
I was first made aware he possibly was controlling my account via a PM i got from him after posting in the meta thread!
In the PM he says "i" agreed to the terms of the sale and that i was paid for the account! But he also said some other user named Maidak said he could contact him on this account which didnt make sense to me. I dont know who Maidak is and the PM looks like it was sent to another account named zeddicus with two d's and he was claiming that user (maidak i think ) sold him the account and for some reason he wanted to protect that account? Im not sure what he meant by that.. im not even sure what account he was trying to protect.
[**THIS IS THE PM** Aug16 in my bayuo inbox!](
At that point i assumed "Quickseller" was in control of my account but i was not sure.  
I have no idea who Maidak is or who the other zeddicus with two d's is.  
At that point all i knew was some stranger i had never spoke with was claiming i agreed to the selling of my account and for some reason he was trying to protect some account. Which account im not sure of.. Im not sure if he was referring to the maidak account or the Quickseller account.
Meanwhile in the thread i started in meta... The person controlling my zedicus account was posting this:
[Imgur screenshot as backup](
At that point this guy was **acting like he was the real Zedicus** and that i was a scammer was trying to steal his account!!!!
I in the meantime was contacting CoinHoarder via Pm and i told him my account was hacked. 
[**Message to COINHARDER**]( 
I contacted him because i trusted him and because I did a 14btc group buy with him about 1yr ago!
Coinhoarder then asked for a signed msg and thats how the whole signed msg thing arose!
**CoinHoarder asking for signed msg**
Of course i controlled that btc address because im the real Zedicus!
Now the whole time i have been trying to be as transparent as possible  .. while the controller of my stolen account was claiming he had blockchain proof but he wasnt willing to publicly share. That didnt make sense to me at all... The blockchain is a public ledger! Why on earth would it be private, nonetheless i didnt sell him my account so it didnt matter what he had. It was just not a fact that i sold him my account! Without a shadow of a doubt i did not sell my user account!  I cannot stress that enough!  
Now here are some facts that may assist you in you investigation if you are willing to clear my name!
- I have never ever once logged in into bitcointalk from a ip address/ip block different from my current workstation. ( please look at my account history before July 12 2014, thats when i last posted with my zedicus account i think.)
- I have never logged in using a vpn, tor or any other masking services. Again check my login history.
- I have never sold user accounts ever.
- I have never been once accused of doing anything remotely not on the up and up! In fact i have never been accused of anything before this said event.
- I have never ever scammed anyone at bitcointalk or otherwise.
- Before the said event I had never traversed or made posts in the bitcointalk market place at all.
- I have never once lied about "anything" ive said regarding my stolen account and ive tried to be as transparent as possible. 
- Im not desperate for money in anyway, you can see whats stored in my public btc addresses!
Im practically an open book! Please feel free to confirm anything ive said by looking in my account at bitcointalk! Past or present!
**That said there is one person here who has told a lie and has publicly admitted it! That person is the person controlling my zedicus account!**
Here he claims that its a new low for scammers and that someone is trying to steal his account!
[Imgur screenshot as backup](
Then when he realizes STUNNA's signature campaign is over ! **He then changes his tune and admits to buying the account from Quickseller!!**
[**Stolen Account admission **](
  
Publicly admitting to lying about his claims that i was a scammer trying to steal his account!...
Also Tomatocage pointed out in this post September 08, 2014, 08:47:43 PM that the controller of the zedicus account is suddenly changin his tune and now claiming its a purchased account when he had claimed the whole time since aug 16 that i was a scammer and i was just trying to **steal his account**!!
Now there one thing i know for sure! **In that very same post the controller of my zedicus account admits to actually having a conversation about the legitimacy of the stolen account with the user Quickseller**!!!


READ IT AGAIN!!! 
********************************************************** 
*Really !!! How did that conversation go? like this????????????*
*I would like to buy the zedicus account from you Quickseller, do you have a signed message from the previous owner to prove you own the account!*
*Quickseller:   No but trust me its ok it will be problem free!*
********************************************************** 
 
**Is that how the conversation went**? .. because anyone selling user accounts would be having that same conversation over and over again right!?
**Do you have a signed msg from the previous account owner to prove its NOT STOLEN!**
 
That question was asked and he knowingly bought the account anyway!!! 
At one point i had even offered the controller of the zedicus account to buy the account for whatever he paid for it.. Keep in mind I was clueless as to what he paid for it at the time! I had no idea my account was "supposedly" sold for 1.1 btc.
 
I had asked Quickseller via PM on August 20, 2014, 06:43:58 AM! To prove he was in control of my Zedicus account. He claimed i didnt respond to his pm and so i said how was i to know he was in control of my account.
**The fool then sends me this PM  August 20, 2014, 03:45:55 PM!!**
[quote author=zedicus link=action=profile;u=87896 date=1408549555]
If this PM becomes public then my decision will be to not sell the account to you for any price. 
You can PM via via quickseller. 
See that...


**  BUSTED!!!!!**
**Quickseller was and is still controlling the zedicus account!!!**
 
Quickseller is a con and i believe him to be the controller of my Zedicus account, either that or they are in cahoots and were working together the whole time. 
Through out this whole experience i have been as completely transparent as possible and from my perspective its not hard to see who is lying. I hope i have made it crystal who is indeed not telling the truth and i hope the facts that i have presented above in the form of public admissions from the current operator of my zedicus account is sufficent enough to at least determine that im not lying!! &amp; and the person who is doing the lying is the controller of my zedicus account the same guy who claimed i sold it to him ----&gt;&gt;&gt; "Quickseller".
Thats said, to further prove that i am not some scammer trying to steal an account. I would be more than pleased if my zedicus account was just permanently shutdown or banned.
At least a these scammers wouldnt be able to impersonate me anymore.
I haven't lost btc and my email address wasn't compromised so i have much to be thankful for.

@_date: 2014-09-28 09:37:21
Hey thanks for the reply.. ive been going over everything trying to figure out how i was compromised and it seems that the security question is a possible attack vector! Its unfortunate but i dont even remember what the security question was .. Its very possible thats what happened as my account password was unguessable for sure!
@_date: 2014-09-28 22:30:58
Exactly... I dont think its unreasonable that we have this perspective .. allowing the selling of user accounts silently condones the illicit activity surrounding them. To be honest i thought Theymos was going to come up with some ideology based libertarian yada yada or something  ...  Instead he just said something about poor and desperate forum users..


@_date: 2014-10-05 04:22:14
Hey Stunna!
Thats ok.. I appreciate the apology.. but its not your fault. Its been one hell of an ordeal. A learning experience for sure. I didnt get my account back, it seems Theymos is under the impression that i sold my account but thats not a possibility. At this point i have no way to prove that the person who broke in my account and proceeded to sell my account was not me. 
To me its crystal clear ..  if someone buys and sells user accounts im sure it would be common to ask for a signed message to prove account ownership. In this case of course they dont have a signed msg from me and all that was required was a pm from someone who was impersonating me to steal my account.  
That said i kinda feel like Theymos dropped the ball .. but im not sure what the backend of bitcointalk looks like. I just new he would be able to look up the details in my account and see that it wasnt me.  
anyway.. thanks for reaching out!

@_date: 2014-09-28 09:05:06
Now regarding your reason for allowing the selling of accounts//
You said 


Murder cant be prevented either and as a society we have chosen to disallow it because publicly condoning such activity is at the minimum appalling by any standard.


Just a thought but if account owners earned their status by putting in the forum time like everyone else maybe we wouldnt have to look at any accounts with suspicion. Also signature campaigns look like they are the cause for the forum being filled with continuous spam. ( sorry STUNNA no offense)


You know there is a market place even inside of bitcointalk.org and there is a 1001 things that people can make money off .. I think its a weak argument to say that you are concerned about users on your forum not being able to make money when they are desperate but you could care less when people are hacking their accounts and violating their privacy! Actually i take that back the first thing you said was that restoring user accounts were your lowest priority but you get what im saying! 
Its a weak argument at best but its not for me to judge you or your community but for what its worth ive had a hell of an expierience and im grateful for not having any financial losses but i just wanted to say that before this experience i had a pretty good time at bitcointalk.org and i positively interacted with the members and the community at large with no issues at all.

Hey thanks for your feedback! Im glad im not missing btc either! In terms of being Keylogged... i dont think so. I use a text encryption software that encrypts everything that i write. Ive only logged in to bitcointalk from one location. Ive never logged in via a mobile account or from a different location. Ive had the same ISP the whole time ive used bitcointalk and it would have been easy for the mods to look into my account and see if i had a habit of logging in from strange ip's! But i couldnt even get them to respond let alone do an IP check!   
  
Im not sure what Bitcointalk++is so we can rule that out.. In terms of blaming the moderators.. im not blaming them for what happened but i am blaming them for what happened AFTER!! There is no excuse for moderators to go silent when a victim is making a plea for help in their community!! Even now why do you think Theymos has remained silent??... Its Theymos's place and he runs it pretty much like a dictatorship so who else should i blame for a policy i dont agree with. I view it pretty much like STUNNA said above.. 


So in terms of it being dumb to blame the mods we can agree to disagree.
 
@_date: 2014-09-27 22:11:56
Because ive PM'd multiple global moderators including Theymos himself and i have not gotten a single reply.

Whoa STUNNA!!! I did not think you would respond here!! Thanks for chiming in.. i appreciate your input!!! By the way i did try to get in contact with you .. I sent you a signed MSG(AUG 16th) from the btc address associated with my account via PM. It was titled "**Help Stunna**!!"
 Forum members named Light &amp; Relnarien gave me the idea to contact you. I believe they tried to reach out too! I also posted in your PrimeDice thread...

Keep in mind i didnt know any of the people in that thread except COINHOARDER which i did a 14 btc transaction with 1yr ago and he was the one who suggested the real Zedicus sign a message from that account! **
Ive posted snapshots via imgur just incase my posts start to vanish but the thread is active. 
After reading my plea and that thread people started leaving a NEGATIVE TRUST on the zedicus account and thats when he finally broke and admitted!!! Im sure your campaign ending had everything to do with it as well!! Before that he was claiming i was a scammer trying to steal his account!!
This is the person who is controlling my account currently admitting to buying my account from some guy named "Quickseller". When i first found out who stole my account (Quickseller) .. I actually asked Quickseller to prove he was in control of my account and he replied using my zedicus account asking to pm him via his Quickseller account! So im pretty sure they are one in the same person or they are in cahoots with one another.

Before he admitted that he bought the account he was claiming i was some sort of scammer trying to steal his account and implying he was the real Zedicus!

What rules are you talking about. The constitution? The penal code? City ordinance? Non of that s*** applies! Im not even sure why they even charged him!  Why didnt they just kick in his doors and put assault riffles right to his forehead and tell him we are going to take your stuff.

@_date: 2014-09-27 22:17:25
I didnt know about all that and frankly its Theymos's community.. I have nothing against him and im not trying to judge him from some moral standpoint or anything like that.. Im just saying, clearly he has thought about this and he has decided its OK for people to steal user accounts and sell them right there at bitcointalk!! Im just asking why?  
  
At the same time i want future patrons of bitcointalk.org to know that user accounts at bitcointalk are not like other user accounts at other community's. Lets consider the amount of vendors at bitcointalk.org and if a large vendor of some community product gets hacked then suddenly all those people who have ever purchased from that vendor are at risk! The hacker/thief would only have to make a single post offering a new product at a discounted rate and watch the btc roll in. All while the real vendor watches in disbelief!! Messaging the mods gets you nothing! There is NO 2factor or email verifications if someone tries to change the email address on your account! NOTHING...

and then to have a policy where you put the personal and private information of your community at risk by allowing people to sell stolen bitcointalk user accounts on the very site itself... Thats just a blatant middle finger to the entire community.

I dont think there is one respectable forum/community that allows people to sell users accounts! Especially stolen ones! The scammers at bitcointalk.org are running a stolen account racket and Theymos is allowing it to happen! 
Its not his responsibility to prevent it from happening "elsewhere" but @ bitcointalk.org i believe its his responsibility! 
Imagine if you saw a listing for someones ebay account on EBAY!!
Imagine if you found someone at the DMV selling peoples info in the parking lot.
Imagine if a DMV employee tells you "**we cant really prevent them from doing it elsewhere**" so we just allow them to do it right in our parking lot!  
  
 
@_date: 2015-05-23 21:40:50
Its appalling and a direct spit in the face of anyone who's account and personal info has been compromised. Vendors beware! From my experience .. If you have sensitive information in pm's or otherwise, the day your account gets hacked .. from that moment forward Thyemos will ignore all communications from you even if you send a signed msg from your known btc address. If you manage to get a hold of him he will state bitcointalk has never been hacked and the loss of your user account was "user error".

Quickseller had a direct hand in the stealing of my account at bitcointalk!  In case you forgot :  
 
Quickseller and the word trust should not be used in the same sentence! He not only managed to steal my account but he also got away with it and you "let him".. He is a liar and i have busted him out several times in my thread and so has Tomatocage! Here is the link to when Tomatocage catches him lying while using my stolen account! At first he claimed i was just trying to steal his account  
and then he changed his tune and Tomatocage called him out on it!
 
I asked for help from the mods including badbear and yourself several times to which i got no reply and eventually i got your attention via a post i made on reddit which really wasnt my intention but it is what it is.. It took a post on reddit for me to even get a response from you!
 For the record, you were wrong. Your inaction spoke volumes, you could have simply frozen the account so nobody could use it. Instead you simply let them walk off with my account tho there was more then enough proof to prove that i was the account holder including signed messages from my btc account. I had never not once had any problem with anyone in the bitcointalk community until that event.  
Its disgusting that Quickseller is in any default trust network at all!
