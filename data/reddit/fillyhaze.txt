Mhmm. That's what I thought.

I'm not saying that what the sub did was right or anything like that. I don't really care. Just wanted to point out that he wasn't banned for any of the reasons he likes to claim. All of the rest of the backlash he's received has generally been because he started to respond to people by calling them LE and generally acting a little unstable (as you put it). All of this was long before he went live and some people from the sub went over to give him shit for using the SR brand.
I'm also going to preempt him here and tell you that I'm one of the people he's convinced is a LE agent here to besmirch his good name. As a perspective customer I went into his sub to learn a bit more about his site and then noticed him talking about his banning and decided to try and explain it to him as politely as i could. Doing that automatically made me LE and earned me a banning from the sub.

oh sorry I meant shills.

It's just mind boggling to me that he goes on the attack so easily, *and* against perspective customers. It just boggles my mind that he acts the way he does as a business owner. 


Man I wish it was that simple, but no way he's shilling for Agora or Evo when he's made three or four threads about them being scammers and stealing peoples money. Either way smart people will stay away from his market once they read his posts, assuming they're on reddit.
But welcome to the party! He'll be here soon to rant about LE and how everyone is out to get him, grab some popcorn.

Prove it. I've linked to your shills, anyone with half a brain can clearly see what they are. So if I'm so obviously a shill prove it.

Just fyi (because I spend a lot of time in he wasn't banned for talking about i2p or anything like that. A few months back the sub decided not to promote anything branded with the Silk Road name, one of his posts got caught by auto-moderator because his username had Silk Road in it and then he kinda lost his shit and started calling everyone LE. 
[Here's one of the mods explaining it to him](

And I welcome them to visit and read through all of my comments. All they'll find is my love of drugs, attempts to be helpful, and a handful of posts where I respond (unnecessarily harshly since you're just crazy) to your claims that I'm LE and pointing out your shill accounts that pop up in and Here's an idea why don't you and your alt accounts and run off to your LE and "censorship free" subreddits you created and continue to yell in your echo-chambers.
I really was open to using your market until you attacked and banned me for a simple explanation. Now this shit is personal. I'm not going to follow you around but if you pop up in a sub I browse I'm going to put a frame of reference to your bullshit.

Ya it was. But he's pretty convinced everyone's out to get him so I guess it's just par for the course.
