The thing about fees is they slowly rise. So you should not have any unpleasent surprises. It is highly unlikely fees be 20 cents one day, and $10 the next. So i dont think there is reason to be concerned. In any case, if you werent using LN, and fees suddenly get "prohitivively" costly, you stand to gain much more from using LN anyway.

Im pretty sure anyone can edit bitcoin code. However changes are public, anyone can view them, chances are bad things wont be added. When the code is changed it doesent automatically affect you. You, or at least a significant amount of people have to adopt it before it comes into effect. So those are the basic checks and balances.
Also, is there anything wrong with profiting? People seem to believe if you profit from something you must be doing bad things. But generally you stand to gain the most, or lose the least, if you do good things. So profiting does not neccesarily mean you are bad. Where did this idea come from?

Bitcoin is in such an early stage of development, the credit card industry has decades of experience and a way bigger market, so of course its streamlined and just work. Situations like yours are what drive better solutions for bitcoin purchases. But you are absolutely right. Things could be better. And i think they will be. Especially if adoption keeps increasing.

Crowdfunding could be epic, but also full of scams if it wasnt for the regulations. I think peoples philosophy has to chance. Allow scams, but allow the freedom to properly innovate as well. Or, restrict everything, limit scams, but also limit innovation.

Yes. Bitcoin is much simpler when it comes to deposits and withdrawals. It involves less trust, and less middlemen, and its practically instant (Settlement can take up to an hour.. which is nothing compared to credit cards and bank transfers)

There is something i would like to add. Bitcoiners, at least here on reddit, like to emphasize that an exchange being hacked does not mean bitcoin was hacked.
But when an exchange is hacked, what does everyone do? They freaking sell off like crazy. Look at what happens to the price. So dont be hypocrites.
@_date: 2016-08-16 20:25:35
You dont know that LN will not be used for small purchases. I think it will. And as i mentioned, there is little to no inherent risk of fee raping. They rise very slowly and prompt frugal behavior and solutions as they rise, which makes them rise even slower.

You know. I dont understand whats taking them so long. If i didnt know any better i would call foul play. But i think they are just slow. The problem is, it costs them nothing. Thats my big problem with regulators. They rather not approve anything at all, and be incredibly strict, because it saves them work in the end. Who really want to approve a Bitcoin ETF, considering the public image of bitcoin? I think the SEC is just procrastinating.

Its actually amusing to think for how long bitcoiners have been thinking, the floodgates will open. One day bitcoin will go form 0 to hero. But when? its been 6 years now. And those 6 years indicate, to me at least, that the growth will be slow and steady. There are no floodgates. They are certainly already open. And the water is slowly pouring in. That is all.
@_date: 2015-12-18 15:59:37
stop this crap. the blocksize should be determined by miners and nodes. make a market for them to do that, in protocol, without creating attack vectors for malicious actors. then we have a truly decentralized thing.

Its because they see oppertunity where others (westerners) see work. Westerners have generally gone lazy, and prefer things to not change, they dont want to think about new things.

@_date: 2015-12-22 20:02:17
That still makes no sense. And by the way no-one is perfect. If what the core devs are doing is wrong, eventually the network will follow someone else. Maybe this announcement will set some forces in motion that will mobilise and alternative implementation, that will be adopted down the road. Who knows. At least the choice is still there, we dont have to follow core, but right now, there is no viable alternative. So dont be sad. If things start getting bad, there will be an alternative, if the core devs wont do the right thing.

I wouldnt call it Denial mode. I imagine that CEO's of banks are busy. And that they dont quite grasp bitcoin, but have been hearing alot about it. They probably also have plenty of money to spend, and the experts they have contacted, or that contacted them, are getting away with some stuff, that anyone who knows about bitcoin, will see is not going to work. A bank CEO, not so much. But at least they are trying.

@_date: 2015-12-30 09:52:11
maybe that is the solution down the line. i think they wanna try this segregated witness first. apparantly its going to double transaction space. so down the line they may not increase increase blocksize limit, but reduce the block time instead as you suggest.
@_date: 2015-12-22 19:59:33
@_date: 2015-12-16 16:59:44
I would understand if there was a promise of increasing the blocksize when its hit and a commitment or mission statement that promises low fees for ever^tm. But there is not such a thing, and then i dont think anyone has done anything wrong. Bitcoin is still an experiment, and a decentralized one at that, so you are here on your own risk:) I think thats the best way to approach it.

@_date: 2015-12-13 02:46:35
I dont know how that chart is generated. But if the exchange rate is rising, so does the average fee when shown in dollars, as that chart does. It could also be more transactions = more fees. It could also be higher fees per transactions. Why do you ask? huh? Why?

Because there is a cap on blocksize, and given the ineffecient nature of the bitcoin network compared to the benefits, the blocks are going to be full even if they increase 10x or more in the future. Demand will overwhelm the miners. If you think they are profitable now, just wait until blocks will be large and full.

I think you are right. Node count is dangerously low. Its only a matter of time before the miners and pool operators will turn against the network. If exchange rate doesent increase significantly before the halving next year, miners wont be able to profit, and in a last ditch attempt to get some more money out of their miners, they will destroy the network, due to the bribes from VISA and mastercard and central banks. *edit* and paypal.

If public scores come back so will the trolls who  live and die for scores. Just go to r/btc for a day or two and you will realise the complete madness that will ensue. Private scores makes it safer to say your opinion, you dont have to worry about wether your comment will get high score or not which means we will have more participation from well known bitcoin people, they dont have to worry about the humilation trolls typically like to do with negative voting. It is beneficial. And people have to deal with the comment itself, they have to judge the comment by its own merit, rather than relying on the stupid number above it, when deciding how wrong or right a person is. So private scores is much better when you think about it. Thank you Theymos. Thank you. Im out.

I dont think miners have over invested considering the drop in supply in 2016 is not a secret. Its also interesting to note that the block reward has already gone from 50 btc to 25, and that certainly didnt slow mining. Bitcoin has never had a central authority and that hasnt kept the protocol from evolvning. Alot of stuff has been done since 2009. And its bitcoins decentralized nature that allows the problems to be solved swiftly and the protocol to advance. Its only because bitcoin is decentralized that some issues may not be dealt with, because they are not of a serious enough concern, or the proper solution have not been found yet. It is simply a myth that the lack of central authority is a problem in and of itself. Its a benefit. There is not even a patent on Bitcoin which means anyone can fork the code and create an alt-coin, or make an experiment and come back with the results. There is no boss, who you have to ask for permission or have to convince before doing anything. No-one is holding anyone back. So in bitcoin land because there is no central authority, things just get done. 
If there is a crackdown on bitcoin, which i dont see how can be effective, people will find ways around it. So thats not enough in and of itself to not invest in bitcoin. There has to be a crackdown and a better alternative at the same time, which would arguably also be the victim of the crackdown in which case bitcoin is still better because it is so far ahead.
And bitcoin will survive with or without the chineese miners. Even if bitcoin was banned collectively in the entire world, it will still survive. Governments have tried banning things before, and it doesent remove the demand, it doesent remove the market. Its still there.

So here is the thing. If people know the halving is comming up, they will be buying right now,  correct? because this price is a freakin bargin. And they have. Its likely the price will hover around this level, i mean, its possible, and then when the halvening happens everyone will just be looking at each other. there will be a moment of silence, until people will fucking start unloading bitcoin on exchange because they realised they were wrong. This is when you should buy. The best part is, not soon after, the price is going to fucking skyrocket because people who sold shitloads realised they sold too much and were wrong again so the market moves in the opposite direction. Meanwhile the big whales, and the smart peeps, are sucking up all the BTC and will sell once the post halving shenanigans are over. tl;dr dont be surprised if price stays around $450-500 until July, then drops below $400 momentarily at that point.. Have a nice day.
Please note the price have almost precisly doubled in November. So if you want to buy coins and profit of the halvening you are too late. You could stilll buy coins now and get lucky that some other event is going to influence price, but i think thats pushing your luck.

@_date: 2015-12-17 08:26:14
In the end there will always be more demand than space per block in bitcoin. In the end there will always be a high fee to consider. We may be able to keep fees artifically low, by expanding the blocksize limit, but the blocksize can still only be so big, and in the end, there will be so much demand that even large blocks will be full, and fees will be significant. But its important that blocksizes are as big as possible, but how do you determine that?

Im not even sure there are alot of people pushing the conspiracy theory. I think its a core of dedicated people here on reddit. Either way, its not true. In order for blockstream or anyone else to control bitcoin development, bitcoin development has to be a monopoly. Which it is not. Its open source, and its ultimately impossible to control or keep things that benefit the network as a whole from being adopted.
@_date: 2015-12-18 16:07:06
do open bazaar rely on blockchain transactions or can you send say 1 btc to it and then you can slowly use it up over time outside the blockchain? because if you cant, the fees on the blockchain will make an openbazaar purchase prohibitively expensive at some point. because i think regardless of what is done to the blocksize there will always be significantyl more demand than there is space, which will push up fees.

@_date: 2015-12-17 12:48:25
I dont recommend bitcoin either because i dont think it will scale properly. It may still work. And if cryptocurrency is ever going to work, bitcoin will be the one. What im getting at is the scaling issue has not been solved, and it wont be solved either by raising the blocksize limit to say 2 or 8mb or more. There needs to be an actual blocksize market so that nodes and miners for that matter compete, for lack of a better term, to make the biggest block sizes. But how this system is going to work, so it cant be used to attack bitcoin, i dont know. 
@_date: 2015-12-05 19:23:23
This seems kind of far out. Bitcoin is not even an established transaction system yet, which is its first obvious use case. What will happen to real estate that is registered in the blockchain, if, say the blockchain is abandonded, this is still a risk and its a significant risk if you have realestate on there. Using it as a transaction system is less of a risk, because you can get in and out when you need to. Real estate is a whole different ballgame and i dont think we are no where near yet.
@_date: 2015-12-16 15:46:38

The diffculty does not control the profitabilty of mining alone. You have to take demand into account as well. For example a coin can be in high demand, yet difficult to mine, but it may still be the most profitable choice due to the demand.

Deep, deep down the people who desparately want to increase the blocksize limit are using bitcoin as a get rich quick or ponzi scheme. In their mind, if the blocksize is limited, bitcoin wont grow and they wont get paid. But that doesent make sense. Bitcoin can still grow if fees become significant. People will just be smarter about using it. Pooled transactions ring a bell? Hello?

The same can be said for BIP101. It was a quick fix. With unknown side effects. It is a risk. I think we got segwit which is better than a blocksize increase. A blocksize increase would also be nice, but caution must be advised. And that is why core is still leading because thats what the market wants. Fuck these reddit bitches who cry end of the world. They are the problem, not core.

Here we go again. 
Fees should not be a part of the blocksize limit debate. We should not be concerned with making them artificially high or artificially low. A safe blocksize limit should be determined based on technical merit and then supply and demand will take care of the fees within those boundries. Thank you.

Who says bitcoin needs governance? No-one should specifically decide what is implemented. I dont believe the Core developers think they should decide what gets into bitcoin and what doesent. They are the ones working on code applicable to bitcoin, and the network basically see fit to follow them at the moment. No-one is being forced to follow Core. They are just the ones we allow to lead at the moment. This is why people argue for competing implementations , so that more ideas get a chance.
@_date: 2016-01-10 19:56:15
To be honest SegWit should be implemented based on its technical merits alone. Not as a form of political measure imo.

Ok. It seems kind of silly to support something like that, when the code is not public, and it was only announced a few days ago. I can only imagine what Core devs think of those people who support something like that. Core has years worth of credibility, but people instantly let them down, over something as measly as a 2mb block size limit increase. Its pathetic. A 2mb blocksize limit increase is pathetic. Forking core to achive it, and setting up for a hardfork and conflict is even stupider. I dont know what people are thinking.

I dont think people get it. Whales in particular are making so much BTC from ETH and have been taking profits since 0.019. Since ETH is traded 90% in BTC, the whales are only increasing their BTC holdings. And naturally they cash it out to fiat to enjoy their winnings. When ETH bubble bursts, bitcoin will be sucking in more fiat than it spits out again and it will be time to hodl. tl;dr bitcoin is REALLY cheap right now.

I think the best way to combat this is with communication. Keep asking them they dont support. Whistleblowers etc. It will be their own doom eventually. The method of 75% shows that you do not trust these forces to work. And then you fundamentally dont trust bitcoin.  90% consensus is not impossible to achive and even a malicious actor can not get in the way for long. Conversely, a big group of people can be wrong and take the protocol places where the staunch 25% believe it shouldny be. 75% consensus sets us up error and takeovers, more than 90% consensus sets up for malicious stalling.

I think part of the problem is bitcoin was sold as being free and instant when in reality things couldnt be further from the truth. Its censorship resistant, but that isnt going to sell bitcoins you know. So people speak the half-truth to further their own agenda - i think some people are into bitcoin because they hope it will make them rich, and they know the key here is to get as many people to buy it as possible - these people will speak the half truth, ie. bitcoin is free and instant now, but it wont always be like this. However, it will always be censorship resistant and sound. Those are completely different qualities, that make bitcoin unique, but people cant relate to it and it doesent have the same appeal, so people chose to market bitcoin differently and gives people a completely different impression unfortunately.
On topic, i think most of the guys who initially supported Classic, after having more time to think about it, have stopped supporting them. I dont think classic is going to be a thing. Before Classic have revealed their patch, Bitcoin Core will be much further along with the implemention of SegWit, which as far as i understand is the first in a series of steps to scale bitcoin (a blocksize limit increase hasnt been ruled out yet either afaik.).

Ok i wouldnt know. Ive never had a transaction stuck. I thought the wallets did a good job when asking the user to make a high, normal or low priority transaction. At least electrum gives the user this option. So RBF is one of those things there are not consensus on, but its being implemented anyway. I think the best thing would have been to develop it, and when the community wants it, implement it. But what do i know. Have a nice day.

I think this is a poor reason. But perhaps i am ignorant. Whatever problems arise from the community, is temporary. Because in the end Bitcoin is susceptible to market forces. Its impossible for a group of people however large, to stop bitcoin from reaching its potential. However i am sad because i recently invested a but load of money into bitcoin. This downtrend is hard on me. But i still believe.
To me, it looks like mom and dad are fighting and the children are suffering. But i think the children will turn out just fine. Have a nice day.
Jesus. The more i read his post the worse i think his critiscism is. He doesent believe in bitcoin because it has downsides. And tries to pinpoint them. But he only focused on the cons. And they may be true, but do the cons outweigh the pros? I dont think so. I think this is Hearn trying to attack bitcoin because he didnt get his way. And the only failure here, is that, if the drop in price has been because of this attack... Well, the markets should know better:) Im sure we will be fine since nothing fundamentally has changed. Good bye hearn.
@_date: 2016-01-27 09:35:04
I think thats where the price is headed. But i think investors are being more cautious than ever, so it will be a very slow climb. I could also be completely wrong and it will be a giant frenzy, from $400 to $5,000 in a matter of days. But i think bitcoin is over that. That was in the old days. The market is much more mature, and those 3x 4x and more increases are history. I could be completely wrong tho. It could be a giant frenzy at some point. But i think those days are over. But i could be completely wrong. It could be a giant frenzy. But i could be completely wrong.

I see that, but there is nothing better than bitcoin. It is still the most decentralized coin, as far as i know, regardless of how centralized it will become. I mean, bitcoin only looks centralized right now because its so popular. Every other coin have the same problems, you just dont see it because they arent as popular. But when people get new ideas, or new ways to do something, i am confident bitcoin will adopt it too and keep its lead. I am sure there are some things that cant be changed, but those are things we probably dont need to worry about. Isnt it safe to assume most improvements or innovations can be added to bitcoin as they are invented?
@_date: 2016-01-30 18:42:11

@_date: 2016-03-03 09:45:12
I dont understand how that is a likely scenario given the scale and commercialisation of mining. I believe the largest difficulty drop happened when bitcoin was still mined by individuals with their their PC cpus. Thats kind of crazy to think about where bitcoin have gone in such a short period of time. From being this geeky thing you could mine with a CPU/GPU to this massive multi billion dollar market cap and huge data centers with miners. And i think this is only the beginning. Have a nice day.
@_date: 2016-01-31 16:05:49
So what do you think of bitcoins future? Is it destined to fall? I personally think if any coin begins gaining momentum, and it can be derived its because a) block times are faster and b) block size is higher. The bitcoin community will get behind a proposal to streamline those parameters in a jiffy. I am also concerned that although other coins appear to have faster block times, and no problems with orphaning, their networks are still tiny compared to bitcoin. I mean, it remain it still remain to be seen wether 10 minute block times is the correct choice. If it isnt, its sort of only a technicality as far as i can see. Its going to take more than for people to abandon btc.
@_date: 2016-01-01 14:25:40
its wrong to use a blocksize limit to control fees. Its wrong to remove it, to keep fees low, and its wrong to keep it to increase fees. Its there for another reason. To prevent attacks on bitcoin. If it can be increased without increased the risk or severity of attacks, please go ahead. But there is also the problem of nodes and miners who have to deal with the increased bandwith. But do we really need to babysit them? Do we, or rather Core, need to decide for them what the maximum bandwidth usage might be?

@_date: 2016-01-17 20:32:04
its probably gonna happen sooner or later. but why not wait until fees start rising to create more room in blocks? to me it seems like we are in this position where there is no viable off-chain solution to transact bitcoin, and there is some promising decentralized tech on the horizon, which if combined, could leave blocks desolated. So i think its wise to wait until there really is a problem, with hardforking for an increase in blocksize limit. Because there is going to be some signifcant changes down the line, some services and tech that will alleviate the use of the blockchain. If we increased the blocksize limit now, that might be a mistake. But its not certain there will be this many blockchain transactions in the future. Ah.. Who am i kidding. I think the blockchain is going to be significantly used regardless. 2mb probably wont be so bad. But it seems like an inconvenience, and alot of risk, to do it, before other scalability methods have been implemented first. Such as SegWit. IM OUT

I dont agree with this. You should not hardfork now if you know it will be neccesary in the future. You should do it when it becomes neccesary. This is most important when it comes to blocksize limit otherwise the blockchain size will just grow 2x when it could have grown 1x (if you increase to 2mb, spam will be able take up most of that). In the end we want people to use the blockchain as little as possible. Only when there is no other option. The blockchain is the last resort. Its not your mainstream transaction system. Its too ineffecient, and its too clunky. This may or may not change in the future, but it will never be as convenient as say paypal. Hate to say it. But i mean it. Good day.

@_date: 2016-03-06 08:00:56
imho it makes sense that that hashrate growth slows when a halving is comming up. Upgrading hardware are miners biggest expense, so in order to not over extend themselves, many will be probably be slowing down the arms race. I would however expect the arms race to pick back up when the halvening is behind us and things return to normal.
Regarding the price correction on BTC, i believe that can be attributed to everyone making so much BTC from ETH, and are taking some of their profits to fiat. Basically if you increased your BTC holding 100-200%, some even profited significantly more, then you dont care that BTC is falling, you still sell to get some fiat for consumption. The BTC buyers however are already lining up to buy this cheap BTC right now.
@_date: 2016-01-18 00:37:38
Wont RBF force you to babysitter the transaction, until it is confirmed? Because if someone else adds to the fee, you will have to as well. And will the noobs even know what to do with an RBF tx? I assume its mostly noobs that get transactions stuck.

But bitcoin is not politics. Unless there is a good reason to increase blocksize limit to 2mb asap dont do it. I would be worried if Core started catering to the so called lowest common denominator, rather than basing their decisions on something more concise. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:31:53

@_date: 2016-03-02 19:09:55
No thats a precurser. A precurser for letting the loudest party and the biggest bully control bitcoin. Look at how Luke Dashjr conducts himself here. Its a prime example of how to discuss hardfork related manners. In contrast to a certain movement which shall not be named, who go out of their way to threaten with a fork, before consensus. Its bullying. But thats off-topic, and fuck them.
However, should we be concerned, that a core dev is concerned that a 50% drop rate in hashing power could occour? That concerns me to be honest. However, after thinking about it i dont think its realistic to expect such a thing to happen unless something utterly broke. Like, if hashing power ever dropped by 50%, there is no point in trying to salvage bitcoin at that point since a drop rate of 50% in itself should be considered a critical failure of the system, bitcoin will never recover from that. The halvening alone cant cause 50% drop in hashing.
@_date: 2016-03-06 16:32:26

Why is that unwise? If they fork so be it. Let it be. We should not sacrifice or compromise on bitcoin just for a sense of togetherness. Do you know what i mean? If people believe 2mb blocksize limit is absolutely neccesary, thats fine, they communicated this. But people are still skeptical. Thats the 2mb'ers problem, they dont have a convincing argument. So their next step is to fork bitcoin, and i am literately facepalming. Good luck. Even if they get a fork going, its not going to be bitcoin. Its going to be an alt-coin. Do you know what i mean? You think people are going to switch? Why would they. I think most people are willing to pay for bitcoin transactions. They are willing to accept full blocks. But not the classic crowd, for some reason. And then Core should change bitcoin to calm them down? You have to be kidding

I dont think you understand that pools consists of individual miners. Have you ever thought about what makes a pool succesful? Ever thought about why certain pools are larger than others? In the end its because they benefit the miners. It hasnt been tried yet, but if any pool operator uses his position to harm the network, miners will take their hashing power else where. So I dont understand your concern. Besides If it wasnt for pooling, the network would not have been able to grow as fast as it does, and would be vulnerable to attack from powerful institutions. You see, pooling gives individuals strength, regardless of how powerful their hardware is. If it wasnt for pooling, you may as well not bother mining, unless your hardware as above as a certain threshold. Without pooling, mining would TRULY become centralized, becuse then only the really wealthy and financially strong will hav a shot at mining for profit. Thats not to say there wont be a day when a pool turns sour. But the odds are low, and the damage it could inflict would be limited before action is taken against it.

Well for what its worth i think RBF is worse than raising the blocksize limit to 2mb. We dont raise the blocksize limit becausae there is no absolute reason to yet (blocks are not nearly full, 0.0005 fee will get you far) but then there is RBF which im not sure what problem is trying to solve?

Garnering any kind of significant support against the Core team is going to take a year as well, and there is no reason to ditch them to begin with. If you believe 2mb block size limit is a good idea (for fucks sake, really? All that for 1mb increase?) be vocal about it. There is no reason to turn things upside down. Besides, its not really cores fault there is no clear path. it keeps changing all the time. first it was bip101 then all kinds of other bips. i mean it might seem simple to you what to do, but to the actual experts, things are not that obvious. of course the excuse is they are evil and stalling on purpose just to hurt bitcoin, because of blockstream and all. but what if things are not as simple as you say.

If you are not tricking people you are causing congestion and confusion. If you reserve space for 0 fees you have no way to prioritize transactions. So its first come first serve. The system will break down if this was the case.
And it looks like you are treating bitcoin as your personal get rich quick scheme. Your line of thinking is, if bitcoin goes mainstream i will be rich. Followed by; bitcoin will go mainstream quick if we make 0 fees. But thats selfish thinking, and its foolish thinking.

Goddamn, im getting insta downvoted it seems. Anyway
I dont think bitcoin or crypto currency in general, can compete with cash and existing payment systems. Not in themselves. Because blockchains are secure but its not cheap. This usually how things work.  Security is a trade off. And you try to balance these things.
However, bitcoin can serve as a building block for CASH and existing payment systems. I mean, bitcoin could be let into paypals systems for example. Then the blocksize limit issue would become irrelevant for people who use paypal to transact bitcoin. And although the blockchain would probably not be used less as a result, people would at least have one alternative to it, when doing bitcoin.. Have a nice day.
@_date: 2016-01-18 17:09:09
I dont think raising the blocksize limit to 2mb is so important that you want to fork the network. I dont think its so important that its neccesary to cause such disruption. I am 100% certain if the hardfork happens, Classic will abandon development. I dont think they have what it takes to lead bitcoin i dont think they have the interest in really getting their hands dirty. Besides what is the difference between Core and Classic in the end, when it comes to governance? What makes Classic better? Is it just because its not Core? I have a feeling thats what people think. Support Classic because its not Core. Well thank you. Some people treat this as i dont even:) Its like kindergarden.

I hate to break it to you, but no one is going to pay bitcoin in a food truck. Its not worth the effort unless you are an enthusiast and like to have the bitcoin accepted logo on the truck. But then what, when ppl ask.  "Oh, you accept btc?" To which yu reply yes and they ask if a lot of people do it and you say no and queue awkward moment. Bitcoin is a niche market, however it's evolving. Few years perhaps payment providers will be lining up to serve you with bitcoin payments. Just not now really, and for a good reason. Its a niche market. If you wanted to help adoption you should become a bitcoin faucet one way or the other. Idk. But to be honest don't listen to me. If you want to accept bitcoin just do it. Get some experience, 0 confirm or not. Who cares if you lose a hotdogs worth of bitcoin to figure out wether 0 confirm is good enough. You know what I mean?

A cure to what? Compared to what? SegWit is a definitive upgrade to the network, where'as a blocksize limit increase. i mean. a blocksize limit increase to 2mb can hardly be considered a cure. I mean, why is the blocksize limit seen as a problem to begin with? There is a limit to how large the blocks can be. And for now, its 1mb, for safety reasons. Maybe this will change in the future. Or other paramaters will change, allowing for more transaction throughput. But just keep in mind that all crypto at least as far as i know is niether less nor more scalable than bitcoin. The limited amount of transactions is a reality in the entire crypto space its not only bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-16 18:21:11
How important is blocksize to the success of bitcoin. This seems to be a debate still. I dont think there have been enough research gone into figuring out the pros and cons of raising the blocksize limit. The masses will tell you bitcoin will die if the blocksize limit isnt raised. But how do they know? It just seems like a knee-jerk belief. In my mind blockchain transactions are clunky anyway. They make me uneasy. I always feel uneasy when sending bitcoin. I want a payment processor to do it. I hope the day will come some day where i can use paypal with bitcoins. Its going to be a huge relief. I think alot of people are in a similar spot, but they wont admit it. Or they wont know it. The moment a reputable off-chain provider is established or opens its doors to bitcoin, people will most likely prefer them over a blockchain transaction :) The blockchain will then be used to reward miners, and keep the bitcoins fundamentally sound. But the way we pass them among each other doesent matter. But of course the blocksize should be as big as possible, but how do you determine that? I think we need an ovjective method to determine max block size. The people who say the sky is falling because blocks are full are completely mis understanding bitcoin to begin with. 20 years from now, even when the blocksize debate has been resolved, blocks are likely still being full. The first years of bitcoin was abnormal, on a long enough timeframe. Because the future will have full blocks permanently, if bitcoin is going to be any success. The blockchain will arguably be more expensive to use than paypal or credit card, because its more expensive to maintain for the miners. It wouldnt be sustainable to subsidize bitcoin transactions because you end up with more spam than usual, which is unhealthy. Yep. Personally i dont worry about the blocksize issue, because every other coin has the same problem. We just dont see it yet, because they arent as popular.
@_date: 2016-03-02 19:02:38
What do miners themselves say? Are they going to abandon mining come halvening? In 2015 Bitcoin exchange rate ranged $200 for a while there. And i dont think miners complained. Now i dont know how much difficulty has increased since then, and what new hardware is available that boosts profits, but the price has certainly doubled, which helps alleviate concerns over miners going bust.
So here is the thing. If block times begin to be longer, because difficulty is too high, then fees are going to increase also, which makes it ever so slightly more profitable once you get a block. However, since mining is basically a lottery, if difficulty is artifically high, the ones that do remain, have a higher chance of winning because others have quit. So even with longer block times, if you keep mining, while others abandon, you may actually become more profitable because you are the only one in the lottery. You know what i mean?
@_date: 2016-01-12 05:33:19
Correlation does not equal causation. Besides, the blocksize limit will not neccesarily limit the amount of users. Bitcoin can continue to grow even if blocks are full year over year. Im just pointing it out. I have no agenda.
@_date: 2016-01-16 21:14:44
I think bitcoin is not that volatile anymore. Going from ~$450 to ~$350 in a day is big. Its a big reaction to something. And i think its an overreaction. I would be very surprised to see bitcoin dip below $300 any time soon. There is just not that much despair. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 17:24:44
I think you get the wrong idea about bitcoin development. Its a protocol, the devs dont cater to the end user. But rather they build something for others to build on top of, for the end user. If you are not a developer of some sort or dont have technical merit you shouldnt have influence over the protocol.

As if raising the blocksize limit is an issue. We have people who believe dumping the experienced and competent development team in favor of smaller group with much less credibility over something that boils down to a technicialty (~1.7mb achived block size vs 2mb block size limit). That a big issue that people want to sack Core for that. Its also an issue that all bitcoin classic wants to do is increase the blocksize limit. It doesent solve anything except kick the can down the road. What about after the fact? Will Classic stay dedicated to bitcoin development. I dont think so. They will abandon the cause and let the Core devs pick up the scraps. Now im out. I dont want to discus this with you.

Reading hearns post again, thinking i might have missed something, since this guy is saying he raised some important points. And i did miss something.


Bitcoin is apparantly *completely* controlled by a handful of people. This guy...
Hearn is basically not adept in working in an environment where he doesent get what he wants. Where he cant control and manipulate. Too bad. But thats not a weakness, thats a strength, mr. hearn. If you want your code accepted into bitcoin, it has to be really, really good. Hearn previously raised the point, using his experience from google, that you needed to just go 130mph and code on drugs. But thats not what bitcoin is about. And its not a weakness. I dont know how else to put it. Basicially bitcoin is the most delicate program/digital thing that has ever existed. Its not a google app where you need to add features, features, features,expand expand expand and not worry about the bugs/financing, because if either fails or stops we just start a new one. Thats how he has been working. But thats not qualities appropriate for bitcoin development. I mean, bitcoin is an experiment. But its not experimental.

I dont think classic is going to be a thing. You know when you try to intimidate someone? You arent really going to hurt them. You just hope they play along. What am i talking about. At least i dont think that Classic and their supporters know what they are doing. Leading bitcoin development is a big task. What about after the fork? Will they just let Core deal with development after that? It would be a defeat for Bitcoin if an organisation like Bitcoin Classic would be able to fork because of a disagreement.

Its not really true. When the internet first started being developed, no-one knew what was going to happen. How big it was going to be. All the things we do with it. A few people probably had the foresight to think of some of it. But most people didnt know. And the innovations build on top of the internet, which is not ONLY used for sending mail, is probably not finished yet.
The same with bitcoin. Its not really designed to send money across the internet. Its something more fundamental. Its a building block, like the internet is. For people to build all kinds of things on top off. Its not really money, well thats just one of its possible use cases.

To me it seems like you are trying to look for who has the greatest authority, and then you want to follow that person. This is probably something you do in your everyday life. You look for authority, and then you follow it.
But thats not how things are supposed to work. The blocksize debate is not about authority. We are not supposed to chose the path the mighty wants. We are supposed to chose the path thats right. So i dont understand why you try to question Core's authority, when you can just say what you think is wrong with their proposal. I mean, some actual constructive criticsism, instead of this ad hominem attacks you are attempting that get us nowhere.
@_date: 2016-01-31 12:03:18
The basic transaction system in bitcoin is not ideal anyway. Its the deepest layer of the protocol, and i cant imagine people using that to transact in the future. That doesent justify the blocksize limit of 1mb,  but i am sure there are other reasons its 1mb.

An mmo does not need crypto. The only potential for crypto in an MMO is the marketing potential. But its going to be a nightmare for the developers, compared to what crypto actually will bring to the table. Games has bugs, it would be silly to use hard cash like bitcoin. There is also the additional aspect of having to keep it safe. the question when it comes regulations and so on. And for what? Crypto brings nothing to games, apart from the marketing aspect.

But not over something that boils down to a technicality. In terms of throughput bitcoin classic is hardly better Core's approach. And bitcoin classic dont even have a roadmap, they dont even have any code available. How can someone get behind something like that? Maybe in a year, when Classic has a reputation if they are still around, it could be considered wether they should take the lead.

This is not a very good argument. Because what about the next time the block size limit is hit? If for example its increased to 2mb. It will just be hit again. And then what are you going to say? Are you going to say the same crap until you have changed bitcoin so much, that its prohitivively expensive to be a node or even a miner.

Leave Core alone.
@_date: 2016-01-15 23:12:32
Okay. But those guys represent the hashing power, they dont control it. Its also important to note that growth of the blockchain can be measured not only in the amount of transactions but on the transaction fees themselves. The higher the transaction fees are, the bigger the demand, the "larger" the blockchain arguably is.
@_date: 2016-01-17 11:32:16
This is the transition. I had to a bitcoin transaction the other day but i wanted to absolutely sure it confirmed with the first block. So i did a small amount of research to figure out what fee i would have to pay. I paid a fee of 0.0005 even tho blocks had been full for about 10 blocks. And i got included in the first block. Plain and simple. If you are willing to adapt, the blocksize limit wont be a problem for you for a while.

Crude oil is more volatile than bitcoin. Ok.
Hmm. And for measuring trading volume it gives the wrong impression when its measured in BTC, since BTC is deflationary arguably, so that will give the wrong impression - Ie. trading volume decreases in terms of BTC. When measured in USD for example, it could very well have increased over time.

I have a feeling that the biggest expense for miners is upgrading hardware. They will pause with upgrades first. So difficulty will stagnate, and then miners will slowly drop off and difficulty adjust accordingly, if it turns out they cant make enough money. But here is the thing. If they made money 6 months ago when price was ~$200. Why wont they be making money in 4 months, when price is likely going to be at least $400? :)

consensus. 


the above problem, the obvious thing to do is to add a new service bit

peers only connect to peers with segwit support.
@_date: 2016-01-19 15:50:08
I dont think thats whats happening. Bitcoin is not a perfect science. And when there is a fork in the road, ie. is it best to do SegWit before a blocksize limit increase or not. Then its not wise to throw a fit about it, like the Classic supporters does.

What is the roadblock? In my mind everything is going as planned. Things could not be better. Hearn is upset that Bitcoin development is not like any other startup he has been involved in. He cant adapt. He doesent understand the delicate nature of bitcoin. You are not supposed to develop new features, and make drastic changes and worry about the bugs etc. after the fact. Because with bitcoin you only have 1 shot. Its not like the startup world where if the app fails, or you run out of money, you just try again. No, with bitcoin you have to be very careful, and Hearn is not the type of guy with patience for that. He has the nerve to call bitcoin a failed experiment, because devs take it slow. But its the other way around. Bitcoin would fail if it was patched constantly, and the easy solutions was picked every time.

Why is full blocks such a tough pill to swallow for so many people? The spammer did us a favor, first of all, he paid the miners, second of all, he helped us fill the glass, making future spam attacks less economical. We are getting to the point where tragedy of the commons is no longer a threat to bitcoin. When blocks are full the network just runs best. My biggest wish is that blocks will be full from now on. (Quote that out of context, why dont you.) And then we see the transaction fees slowly yet predictably rise. People will provide all sorts of solutions for a more frugal use of the blockchain. It literately is a win-win. Miners get paid, blockspace dont get wasted. And then when we get to about $1 in fees. Lets raise the blocksize limit. How is that? Lets go.

@_date: 2016-01-17 13:55:49
I think its incorrect to consider bitcoin is the copper. Crypto currency in general will be the copper. But there is not enough abundance in bitcoin to be considered copper. It is a much rarer commodity. Not because its limited to 21 million coins - they are in principle infinitely divisible - but because of the amount of transactions possible per unit of time. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 04:20:43
0 conf reliability is an unintended consequence. Originally they recommended 6 confirmations to be safe. Besides, if they can make the US dollar, which wasnt even digital to begin with, able to be transacted via the internet, i am sure people will think of ways to transacted bitcoin outside of the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-01-17 23:58:29
The worst thing you can do if you want whats good for bitcoin and really believe in what you propose, i suppose an increase to 2mb block size limit. Then dont cry monopoly if other persons disagree.

I know the headline is just to get clicks and make a good article. But why is it in debates you often see someone say, for example "Bitcoin is dead." then you get swathes of people trying to prove him wrong. The person who say its dead has to proove it or at least explain why he believes so. The burden of proof is on him to be honest.

okay. for some reason i thought that was the big deal. what is the big deal?
@_date: 2016-01-03 08:13:32
but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. and you dont make bitcoin free by reserving space for 0 fee transactions. you push the cost over to the remaining people who dont get into that reserved space. and if you increase it, you just make the miners eat the bill. Please
And you dont change the rules all of a sudden. The rules have to be the same otherwise you confuse the market. And we dont want to confuse the market. We want stability. Can you imagine what will happen down the road? Ok so we have held a hand over you for years. But this is changing now, and we are introducing fees. People will go berzerk. Its down right evil tricking people into using bitcoin with artificially low or 0 fees.

It is not an unpopular belief that RBF is a solution looking for a problem. How come its being implemented now, when on the other hand, when it comes to blocksize limit, there seems to be no sense of urgency for increasing it, so it stays in place for at least another year. Im not arguing for raising the blocksize limit right now, i guess i am arguing for postponing RBF as well.

@_date: 2016-06-01 17:07:44
I wonder what problem you are trying to solve? If you decrease block times, selfish mining is assumed to increase. So when you think you will get your deposits credited faster, by decreasing block times, think again, because merchants and services will have to ask you to wait for even more confirmations then.
@_date: 2016-06-25 10:34:41
The best thing you can do, that do not require any education, or skill of any particular sort, something anyone with a little money can do, is spam the network with high fee transactions. This way you increase demand for solutions that reduces fees. Have a nice day.

But centralized services has its place, look at youtube, facebook, etc. huge succeses in terms of users and daily traffic.

Okay but dont you lose out from valuable input when you fragment the development process? Do you think Core devs are concerned with Classic code? And vice versa? The best thing you can do to be honest is to submit your idea or perhaps work in progress to the Core github/Channels. You get invaluable feedback.  Do you know what i mean?
Because bitcoin, or at least Core is open source, its already decentralized. There is no need for a competing team, unless the goal is to create an alt.coin.

How do nodes in DASH work? Because in bitcoin is trivial to set one up, but wether it benefits the network or not, requires it is set up properly. You also dont have alot of use of 50 nodes at the same datacenter, i imagine something like this would happen, if nodes had a financial reward. Last but not least do nodes need a financial incentive to begin with before people will bother to set them up?

It is not right to compare the blockchain with visas payment network. They are two completely different things. Bitcoin should be compare to other crypto currency. And does any other crypto match bitcoin in terms of security and throughput?

What about the block rewards then? Block rewards + No block size limit ist just an economic tragedy. Block reward and blocksize limit goes hand in hand. Because who knows how large blocks miners would be making right now, if they didnt get 25 BTC for free every block (soon to be 12.5)

If you fork at 75% you are basically throwing 25% of the network and infrastructure etc. away. This will especially be reflected in price. If the 75% hardfork amounted to anything, the market woulld likely decline 25%. Thats not to say it wont regain that, but there is the chance that the 25% that stayed behind actually had the right idea, and their crypto currency will be the one people prefer in the future. So yes, its not without risk to fork at 75%. Have a nice day.

Lets not make a big deal out of this meeting. Because it wasnt. Its a casual meeting between a few actors in the bitcoin space, a few of which stated will be working on hardfork code.

Im not forgetting that its expensive to run a data center. That was my point. My argument is, its expensive to set up data centers, so they dont do it willy nilly. Maybe swathes of data centers will be abandonded come bitcoin halving, but i wouldnt count on it. Also have to keep in mind that through most of 2015 miners were selling at or below $200. They are making so much more right now, i think there is plenty of room for the halvening.

How often do you use bitcoin? You make it sound like its a big deal if on chain transactions costs rise. I get its not nice when prices rise, but its not going to be the end of the world. Do you really see yourself using the blockchain to send and recieve bitcoin 5 or 10 years from now? Its so clunky, its non-reversible. You will prefer alternative means, you just dont know it yet. Alot of people dont understand this. But they still like to make a big fuss about it, as if transacting with the blockchain is the best thing ever and bitcoins killer app. When in reality its scary and frustrating.

Not as such. But if miners decide to change the consensus rules without signficant consent from users, devs, etc. Then the coin will still be damaged, as well as the miners prospects of earning money in the future. But the coin will still be damaged. But of course the argument is miners do not have an incentive to go against consensus and damage the coin.

These guys actually thought they were going to take the protocol in a certain direction after their meeting? Another thing, it doesent matter what title adam signed with on the roadmap. The important part is that someone is exploring the idea of a hard fork. It doesent change a thing wether adam signed as blockstream president or not. Unless you believe blockstream is in charge of bitcoin. But why would you? I also think its retarded to begin with to sit down and agree on dates for when to present code. Whats the rush? I dont understand that meeting. Whats the deal? Miners think they control the protocol or what? And if devs dont please them, they will i dont even.
@_date: 2016-02-01 13:06:13
Its a big responsibility pushing for a blocksize limit increase. I dont think miners have the expertise anyway. They are good at mining, and rightly so they focus on that. They have suggested they are open to a blocksize limit increase, which is fair. But pushing for it, seems like a big responsibility. You probably wouldnt understand, most redditors dont anyway. They think its so simple :) But thats because they are spoiled.

@_date: 2016-02-24 02:35:14
I agree with the approach to not move the blocksize limit for a while. Because we need the community to think about when blocks are inevitably going to be full anyway. Blocks has to be full from now on. And the blocksize limit should not be increased proactively but rather retrospectically (is that the right word?). Its overall better for the ledger. Spam is reduced, and people will start thinking of ways to reduce the load on the blockchain.
Some people like to make the blockchain free of charge, but they ignore the tragedy of the commons. People will just abuse it, if its free. For better sustainability and environmentally friendly i mean to avoid polution in the blockchain, blocks has to be full from now on. Blocks should always have been full. Remember the shit Satoshi Dice took? They millions of transactions are on the blockchain now. They took advantage of it, and the creator is not affiliated anymore. He is a millionare now, since he sold. Why should he care what he did to the blockchain? IT WAS FREE at the time.
So when do we decide to increase the blocksize limit. Thats good fucking question yo. Perhaps when fees get around to $1? Daymn. This blocksize limit debate is crazy.

For some reason i have a feeling if you were able to contact Kraken, who recently aquired an canadian exchange, would be able to help you out. But its going to take some effort on your part, because contacting them is not easy, and they even have to be willing to help you out, since i imagine accepting a check (via mail) is something they dont have procedures for. But who knows. If the amount is interesting to them, they might go out of their way  to take it, and credit your account with the equivalient in CAD or whatever. Then you trade bitcoin from there...

This is why i am inclined to believe there will be a better crypto some time. Because there are too many arbitraty parameters in bitcoin. If 1 BTC turns out to be around $500 in 12 years. I personally think it will be worth alot more, or 0. There is no in between in such a timeframe. Bitcoin either has to grow, or die. No inbetween. You know what i mean?
Anyway, IF bitcoin IS $500 in 12 years. Miners will simply adjust. It will be back to GPU mining and what have you. Because thats what the first miners were making. They were barely making $500 per block afaik.

Thats pessimistcally, not realiostically. The halvening could be a big event. And it could certainly influence the dynamics of the network in the time after. Maybe bitcoin will make big news again. Either in the form of a rally, or, maybe a mainstream bank will finally get on board. I know that banks are all waiting for someone to be the first mover. I mean, they already know about bitcoin and talk about it among themselves. Its just a question with who is going to make the first move. Maybe someone will step up in 2016. Who knows.

Well how else would you do it? 75% is just enough to not seem bad, and low enough that your chance of succes is higher. After all, the important thing is the change happens. Not neccerily that 25% of the hashing power might be against.
@_date: 2016-02-01 15:18:14


This is especially true when it comes to the bitcoin ecosystem. Fractions of the ecosystem should not start competing against each other for which direction to take bitcoin. Rather a path should be chosen in unity. To hell with the competition. Its just something people praise because they think it sounds good.

what is their plan? private blockchain to secure an asset? how are private blockchains secure? is it because they are open by default? so you can see if anyone is meddlening with it? i can see that working out. the problem is if a hostile entity starts hashing on the chain. i think it could do some damage. but there are probably ways to alleviate that. have a nice day.

@_date: 2016-02-04 00:12:11
@_date: 2016-02-08 10:58:47
Well its not unlikely. I mean if you had alot of hashing power you would distribute it over several pools. Just to not piss anyone off. But according to bitfury ceo, they put alot of effort into distributing their state of the art miners across the globe. Ie. they dont sell bulk to single individuals or companies, at least thats what they say.

I dont mind, im in this for the long run. And taking a sound approach is best long term. The reference client shouldnt be doing too many things at the time. For now it seems the focus is SegWit and it has its benefits. Arguably if experts hadnt been screaming doom and gloom, the market would not have been upset to the same degree. If the experts would have gotten behind the SegWit proposal so it could be done, and then start thinking of a blocksize limit increase. But one thing at the time, especially when dealing with these delicate issues.
@_date: 2016-02-14 15:01:08
Okay, but do you think we are at that point right now?

Thats the reason central banks exist. So lending out money becomes less risky. Of course its creates this zombie monstrosity of an economy we have to day. But.. Ye, the central banks were created, at least thats the offocial explanation, to do good. For the benefit of us all. Psh :)

So why are they going against bitcoin and not etherium?
@_date: 2016-02-20 22:57:43
I dont think this is supposed to placate anyone. Because that implies this consensus is politicially motivated. There should be 0 tolerance for political influence on the protocal layer. After going over the slides, it seems Core is determined to get their point of view across, and this effort has paid of. It was not a bargain for the hashing power. Do you know what i mean?
@_date: 2016-02-02 23:26:12
The practical use of bitcoin is not stagnant. Even if in a few years time there is going to be a bank coin, bitcoin will also have evolved. Bitcoin has such a headstart and its so decentralized  that "catch up" will be easier said than done.  I mean, if you think the practical use of bitcoin is bad now, just go back 3 or 4 years. 
@_date: 2016-02-07 13:08:09

To a large degree the threat of full blocks is made up. I never met anyone who can explain or demonstrate what will happen when blocks are full. What the negative effects will be. You are probably already facepalming, but i mean it.
@_date: 2016-02-12 17:29:21

@_date: 2016-02-20 13:49:37
How so?
@_date: 2016-02-02 22:39:48
You raise some interesting points. But the adoption process is not that important. They are - hoprfully - building something solid, something strong for the future. For people to build upon. Do you know what i mean? The blockchain is the deepest layer of bitcoin. Its not meant for end users and merchants to begin with. But they sort of have to for lack of Alternatives. If anything adoption is too great compared to the pace of bitcoin develop, apps, infrastructure and so on. 
@_date: 2016-02-07 21:38:05
Ok so maybe 2016 wont be the big year. But these banks that try to do something on their own, there are actual investors and startups doing something with bitcoin. I mean, i think the bitcoin startups will be superior to the bank shenanigans. But i dont have anything to base that on. I just think bitcoins decentralised nature will cause it to win out in the end. Its like people trying to make their own internets i guess. But in the end, market forces converged on a single large one primarily.

I suspect the harder they try to battle crime, the more corrupt various banking institutions etc, will become. In reality the crime they are talking about here is the market. For example, a person selling something to another person, drugs. This is considered a crime because... I dont even. And they have been trying to stop people from purchasing drugs from  one another for decades. And it just doesent work. The harder they try, the more the black market and criminals will consume of the legit economy and institutions. That is my 50%. Have a nice day.

Its important they figure out a procedure for how to increase blocksize limit in the future, before increasing it now. Otherwise its just going to be a huge debacle again. And who knows. We have been going several years before hitting the 1mb blocksize limit. But what if its only going to be a year before we hit the 4mb one? Thats why its so important to find a proceudure for how to raise it, before actually raising it.
Also what will these people do if the code for hard fork isnt ready by July 2016? (I dont think it will. I have little reason to believe the blocksize debate will be over by then, and that second of all there will be code ready for deployment by then. Unless they just want to knee-jerk raise the blocksize limit i dont see it being done within the next 4-5 months as these representatives will have us believe)
@_date: 2016-02-14 15:19:50
I wonder if traders actually care about the blocksize limit.  I mean, look at ETH. Traders did not care what the fuck it was, only that it was rising. And they get on board :D Of course this gives exposure to the coin, so its a good thing. Right?
@_date: 2016-02-06 00:52:38
They want to do it now. Because they want to. It makes no sense.

What does that even mean? Do you control when you lose your first baby tooth?
@_date: 2016-02-09 00:07:35
Here is what im thinking. Bitcoin is weak right now. But i think when the shit hits the fan, it will be the crypto people rally to. It is sort of like the US dollar, who in times of trouble, have seen an increase in populairy. I think the same is the case among each individual crypto vs bitcoin. But of course i could be wrong. Of course it could be wishful thinking. But, in my limited perspective, there is nothing bitcoin cant do, that other crypto can. So even tho we see these alt pumps, i think bitcoin will remain the winner. This is at least how i defend holding btc at this point. Have a nice day. 
@_date: 2016-02-04 00:23:16

Why did Gavin break away from Core?
@_date: 2016-02-10 20:15:44


Who has absolute control over the technical direction of bitcoin? The reference client is open source and its even on github which makes it incredibly transparent and the ease of contributing significantly high. Thats decentralization. If the dev teams Arent competing why the split? What is wrong with Core?  Maybe i am wrong and the two teams will help each other, but if that is the goal, why not stay under one banner?
@_date: 2016-02-07 12:57:26

If people have data centers now, its even less likely that difficulty will be affected. Do you know what i mean?

Do you know what i mean?
@_date: 2016-02-07 19:18:09
The language...


He said fixing. When in reality, the blocksize limit of 1mb may in fact be optimal. In which case it doesent need fixing. One could argue that 1mb block size limit is leading blocks to be full now, but so what. If 1mb is the optimal limit, then it doesent matter if blocks are full. Even so, raising the blocksize limit with 1mb cannot be considered a fix by any means. Have a good day.


Again, why is the 1mb blocksize limit a problem? Because blocks are full? Blocks being full is not a problem in itself. There has to be a limit to blocksize otherwise the total size of the blockchain would get out control imo. As well as bandwith use etc. The blocksize limit should be the last thing that gets used when attempting to scale bitcoin, not the first. And there are options already being worked on, such as SegWit and sidechains/lightning network. I mean ,even a system like paypal could work on top of the blockchain layer to alleviate things. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 20:20:06
Not only that, but it was also marketed as low fees. And this was true for a while - micro payments never amounted to anything - and now the fees market is starting to arrive.

@_date: 2016-02-01 15:15:57
That logic is sound. But there still seems to be no clear course of action regarding the blocksize limit. And if you wish to increase it, you wont have an easy time, and thats good. Changes to the protocol should recieve scrutiny. Now that the "blocksize limit change" lobby has narrowed their proposal down to a 1mb increase, the skeptics are saying its too little. Haha, damn if you do, damn if you dont. Have a nice day.

To my knowledge other crypto is not cheaper to use or more scalable than bitcoin etc. Do you have a specific crypto in mind tho?
@_date: 2016-02-10 16:57:40
Well the markets certainly says otherwise. Because the most active pair on exchanges is ETHBTC, which suggests people are using ETH as a side bet. They are still technically long on BTC. It would be different if ETHUSD was the most active, but its not. ETH-&gt;Any Fiat pair is only about 8% of the total trading currently going on. To put it another way, thats perhaps more easy to understand, when you speak with traders that cashed out of ETH recently, they do it to BTC.
@_date: 2016-02-11 15:31:32

The weak nodes are folding. Im not sure wether this is a good thing or a bad thing. Im not sure wether you can objectively state that a network with 1000 nodes is better than one with 500. I mean, node count is not the important factor as much as what each node is capable of. 500 super nodes is arguably better than 1000 casual nodes. Am i right?
@_date: 2016-02-06 01:28:04
Why is he doing it? Why is he taking the blocksize debate to the public like this? What does he hope to achive? He cant get the technical experts on board, so he relies on social media and plebs to gain momentum. He should stop, because he is doing more harm than good.
@_date: 2016-02-09 02:18:36

Exactly, nobody is going to care if fees double to $0.10 or triple or quadrouple to $0.50 at peak loads. The biggest problem will be people who get transactions stuck, because they didnt pay attention to the fee. But rbf is going to adress that. Meanwhile additional tech to enhance scalability get the chance to be developed/finished and consensus for a blocksize limit increase may even develop.

@_date: 2016-02-12 08:50:05
The market doesent care about the 1mb vs 2mb block size issue. It is confident that bitcoin will scale regardles of what is done short term. The market worries about the possible political capture that is using the blocksize limit issue to gain traction. If anything you should not be blaming Core, but the few 'experts' that say Core's approach is not good enough, when in fact it is good enough for now. Its actually not only good enough, it is some pretty cool stuff they are working on.

Mind if budge in? Because there is nothing stopping bitcoin from being a currency. Take the dollar for example, which doesent even have a blockchain, its still widely accepted as currency. The same can be the case for bitcoin, even if it costs x amount of bitcoin to use the blockchain. Do you know what i mean?
For example every transaction made in dollars do not pass through the federal reserve. If that was the case it would be an even uglier monstrocity. Things are much more decentralized. And the same can be said for bitcoin. Not every transaction has to pass through the blockchain. if that was the case it would be an ugly centralized monstrocity.

They already are visible on the blockchain tho.
@_date: 2016-02-24 08:27:18
I dont think the fees play any significant role in the adoption of bitcoin. Not until they get to around ~$1 dollar. Until then, the network has to optimise and find every possible way to avoid using the blockchain because it is a finite resource. When fees start to rise and become prohibitively expensive - then blocksize limit can be raised. Because by then the network will be optimised. Now im not too sure about this approach, but i am against keeping the cost of using the blockchain near 0 because people cant handle it. They will hoard the space until there isnt anymore available. And then start thinking about alternative means. It just puts an unncessecary strain on the network when blockspace is free.
@_date: 2016-02-20 22:45:20
makes no sense to be honest. you also have to consider that roadmap was signed by 150 experts i believe. it seems unncesecary to get them to sign a new one, since the only thing that has changed, is an increased effort to pursue hardfork solution/code. when thats ready its time for a new round of "signing" for implementing it..
think of it this way. the formal roadmap from core is a block, its signed, and its history, this new short term roadmap is the next block, signed, and history. no reason to go back and change the first one. 
@_date: 2016-02-06 01:32:18
A 1mb blocksize limit increase is stupid. In terms of fees it makes almost no difference. Lets say the demand for blockchain transactions doubles. With 1mb blocksize limit fees = 10 cents. With 2mb blocksize limit, fees = 5 cents. Is it really worth going through this trouble and causing so much turmoil for that?
@_date: 2016-02-22 01:15:36

I have a feeling Satoshi figured out bitcoin wasnt going to be the final crypto, and disappeared. He gave it to gavin for lack of a better candidate. Satoshi just wanted out. Being japanese he was embarrased that he didnt think everything through. I am sure he believed in bitcoin so much and dedicated so many years of his life to it, that realising it wouldnt work in the end, made him take his own life.

Yea thats a good point. But realistically, bitcoin is just not ready to be considered an alternative yet. I mean, i needs much better liquidity. And it still has these child diseases? Such as the scaling debate. I mean, it doesent matter what we choose, to a large degree, as long as there is agreement. So when people will trust Core again, or at least unite under one banner, i think its best to stay away from bitcoin. Because there is alot of distracting things going on in the community right now.

It creates an incentive for the existing payment structures to get on board. In reality we are lying right now about the costs of a blockchain transaction since its subsidized by the block rewards. 
If we permit fees of say $0.5-$1 paypal will get $$$ in their eyes. Because then they can open up their network and take $0.2 or something for a bitcoin transaction if you paid with paypal. And then you have two worlds comming together for something absolutely epic. Also in paypal, people get to make a comparison directly with EUR, USD and BTC. One is increasing in value, arguably, and possibly cheaper for paypal to manage due to decreased amount of regulatory overhead (i dont know, its possible) And then bitcoin will look superior. Shit. lets get bitcoin on paypals network. Pls. Please. dont be afraid of fees.

Thats horseshit to be honest. Anyone can contribute a patch or piece of code, and even review what others are contributing.

As long as the implementation is open source, its not centralized.

Effeciency.. That is a strange word when it comes to bitcoin. Because it is a single organism, that if its threatened, if its really threatened, will pull together and sort things out. The 1mb blocksize limit is not a threat in itself. I mean it would be nice with larger blocks sure. But we need to do it the right way. And being right, and being fast is not always the same.

Bitcoin is not a worldwide payment network. Its a distributed ledger and the soundest digital asset you have ever seen. This is for people to build on top of. Or what? You think people wont bother with a crypto that ... that ... is expensive to transact on the deep layer? maybe, not. If you get something adequate in return, i dont think the fee you have to pay matter. Maybe people will give up on using the blockchain transaction system for retail purchases. But there will probably be ways to still use bitcoin for retail purchases.

i personally think the r3 is way overblown. who knows how much money banks spend on startups. to the banks this r3 is just another arrow fired in the dark. i mean i wouldnt be surprised if banks are simply throwing money at everything hoping just a percentage of it will be useful. Do you know what i mean? To us, R3 etc. seem like a big deal, but to banks its just some random thing they are trying.. They are not consciusly behind it, as if its going to change the world. They just arrogantly throw money at it because they have so much, and hey maybe it will turn out to something good. Thats the mentality. And then you have the engineers and software developers who perhaps dont even believe in the system themselves, but of people wanna pay them to try and make it work, why not? Do you know what i mean?

It can be hard to imagine your funds being locked up right now, because thats not how the bitcoin network currently works.

There is a risk the network will detereorate under certain conditions if the burden on miners and nodes increase. There is also a difference between being a global currency and a global payment system. I think it would be foolish to suggest blockchains in their current forms be used as a global one size fits all solution to a payment system due to their inherrent ineffeciency.
Bitcoin can still achive worldwide adoption, but for this to happen 3rd party payment systems are going to be essential. But most importantly the network has to remain robust, so that the individual tokens are secure and can be used as money in the first place. And this where careful weighing of parameters such as blocksize seems important.

Its no surprise he is working at coinbase. Maybe he is acting the way he does in an attempt to impress the CEO because he has been in favor of cranking up bitcoin throughput for a while. But i think coinbase's buisness model relies on bitcoin as a payment system they can piggy back on, ie. too lazy to develop an actual payment system. People piggy backing on bitcoin is undesireable for it because of the way it works by keeping a permanent record. I suspect bitcoin to coinbase is just something they will use and throw away if need be. Which would explain why they dont support development. They are just here to exploit.

Its not about giving me gold. Its about enabling me to speculate in it. There is a real demand for this from traders. If i wanted gold i would just buy it. But with the bitcoin based gold token, i dont have to, but i can still speculate in it when i want.
I guess if they ran the distributed ownership database that would make things unnecesarily complicated. All we need to know, or need to trust, is that a particular bitcoin token represents x amount of gold. The ownership of it is determed via the blockchain (it will most likely just be kept on an exchange and the exchange will keep track and not really passed around on the blockchain much)
lets make a gold backed bitcoin token and release it on kraken for people to speculate in. It will be a huge success and pave the way the bitcoin backed oil tokens, stocks, and various other commodities. Kraken will transform into a fully fledged exchange for traders to trade anything, powered by the bitcoin blockchain.

When you think about it bitcoin is just an empty token. With no prospect of additional fungibility. Its just a token. Like a chip at a poker table. Its not worth real money.

They are on to something big. People with ether who want to speculate on gold can get a digix token, instead of going to a broker that does CFD or futures. This token can exist on crypto exchanges. It cuts out the middle man (traditional broker) for traders. If crypto doesent die, this is going to become a very big market.

I dont even know if its possible with bitcoin, but it should. But since you are not trying to provide your gold certifiate to the legacy broker system, i would argue that you are free of the regulatory constraints on that system. In the eyes of the authorities, bitcoin is not money, as far as i can tell. So they dont care wether you make a gold backed bitcoin certificate. They dont care. Only if you want to put it inside the legacy trading system, but why would you? The idea is to enable bitcoiners to speculate in gold. Not the legacy traders.
This is arguably such a small market right now, ie. the demand from a bitcoin trader to speculate in commodites etc. is tiny, but its evolving, and i think its very exciting.

I think it demonstrates the danger of pools. Im sure that if Bitcoin Devs pushed a contentious hardfork the pools would update, and nodes would catch up. At least most. Eventually. So what is the problem? The problem is that 1 contentious hard fork the community may accept. But the 2nd, there will be more dissent. And the 3rd the community will split for good and there will be several coins. There has to be super, super majority consensus before a hard fork is initiated. Throwing it up in the air and hoping everyone will catch it like they did on ETH is simply not sustainable. If ETH didnt have mining pools, i think the other chains would have had much more work going into them simply because people hadnt updated, perhaps through lazyness, but also perhaps to make a stand. But the lazyness, really is the strength. Because it makes sure, to a degree, that no-body can swiftly make the protocol swallow a bad pill. Except they can, because of the pools who will divert everyones hashing power for them on the chain devs prefer. I am rambling. I am out.

If you are a social media platform, how can you find the resources to also manage a blockchain, and be responsible financially for what happens to the tokens?
This is why among other things it makes sense to stick with bitcoin because its tried and tested. There is no other benefit from using a private blockchain other than you get the chance to premine it, and profit from that, if the token gains any traction. But long term a private blockchain seems like a bad idea because it requires significant technical expertise (is not cheap), and its a big responsiblilty. If you just want micro payments on the site, you may as well use bitcoin. I know the blockchain fees do not really allow for micro payments, but that fee is only gonna be paid when you enter and exit a given site with your bitcoin. So you send a bulk amount of bitcoin, for example 0.1 and then you have a balance you can use for micropayments over x period of time. And to people who say its not safe to keep bitcoin on a website, well are you paranoid or what?

Good news on SegWit or lightning will certainly push sentiment up. But there are is still a few issues with it that are unsolved. So it could be months, it could still be a long ways away. But its not really going to stop the outsiders from adopting bitcoin. Its the insiders and old timers that have been used to no tx fees that are hurt the most. A new guy deciding to adopt bitcoin will probably humbly accept it. Especially if this new guy is joining with $100k. He wont care about a $0.20 to move it. Hopefully lightning and segwit will be a success, so playing becomes cheaper for everyone.

Im not sure mining pools are fine. The protocol can become victim of lazyness. Miners too busy tending their farm, taking orders from the pool admins. Before you know it, you have a hardfork active with some crap that wasnt discussed properly. Its an unlikely  scenario, but i think its annoying. The problem is that bad things have to be rushed, and mining pools helps them accomplish this. Good things will happen over time. So if every miner had to individually make a decision on wether to upgrade or not, if every miner had to follow the community and not his pool representative, i think we would be more secure.

I think in order to start a free state you move to one of the most liberal countries in the world. For example Scandinavia. Then you pick a part of the country and secceed. There will be 0 political interest in using military or police to stop the people in question, because they are so afraid of getting their hands dirty, and being liberal  they dont want to use the military. But the most important thing is the apparant apathy. They will just let it happen. Look at Denmark, who already have a free state inside the capital. [Christania]( I think Denmark is the perfect place to start a free state. But do it as far away from the capital as possible. There is plenty of land available i think. When you look at the history of Denmark and compare it to France for example. France had a very bloody revolution, very violent, in order to get to this "western cultural ideals" back in the day. Where as Denmark, it just happened. There was no fighting. It was the most peaceful revolution ever.

Or maybe he has respect for the product. You know what i mean? Respect for the decentralization. In the end, the idea is that bitcoin cannot hardfork succesfully just from the suggestion of a simple guy. 
The point you lay out here belong in a centralized system where someone is in charge of the hardfork. Where in bitcoin, at least the idea is, hardforks are more of a suggestion. Softforks too. Where as the ethereum hardfork had another connotation  to it. They made it look like it was voluntary, but it really wasnt i think. They were gonna push  it regardless, and they did it because they know the network follows them. Is that a good thing? :) Its not decentralized at least.

I agree. Being able to settle on demand would be a boost to confidence. A solvency test. But i think this accomplished the moment you try to spend the token on the blockchain. Other than that, the company behind the certificate maybe has to deliver the gold on demand, but it seems like a bad idea. There has to be another way to demonstrate and keep solvency in check. Because shipping gold across the globe is not really that cool.

How long does it take to gain trust for a blockchain? In a year, things could look much different. People are also looking to each other, when finding out which blockchain to work on. And some alt-coin have companies exclusively backing them. Thats a first in crypto history? I mean, when companies who are not a wallet, or an exchange, gets behind an alt-coin thats when you know it has something special. And people will be looking at the first movers, to see what they are doing, and that gives it more and more trust. Isnt that what you call network effect?

Shapeshift has been known to do wrong fees, and otherwise have delays. If you ever have a problem with a payment you will likely have to duke it out with ShapeShift and BitPay support, however good they may be, so what you thought was going to be a breeze and what ever it was that you wanted may take days or weeks to clear.

Bitcoin is updating its scripting language one step at the time. With the most recent addition of CSV. I cant tell wether this is is a good or bad thing, but if a proffesional company had to chose between a bitcoin or an ethereum startup, then i think the choice will be Bitcoin because it has a long track record of no major incidents . For example if you wanted to tokenize something. If you wanted to blockchain an asset. If you were serious about it, wouldnt you chose bitcoin? It may be more restrictive than Ethereum, but its not a bad thing. Its on purpose afaik.

There is an element of trust involved. But its ok. Speculators have evolved to trust exchanges, im sure they can trust a company that releases a gold backed bitcoin token. The benefit is, you can go directly from a bitcoin token to a gold backed bitcoin token without using the legacy broker system.

My concern is that for tokenized assets, you dont need more than a satoshi to peg it to.

Your best bet is probably gambling if you want your bitcoin to turn into more bitcoin (this includes alt-coin speculation). We are in such an early stage of development, its incredible. And it thoroughly annoys me that people are working on two different blockchains, that is Ethereum versus Bitcoin. Together we could be much stronger. But that isnt going to be so. Anyway, i think in the future we will have reliable investments that can yield a passive return for a bitcoin holder. I know there is a demand. Thats why alt-coins are so popular, as well as ponzies, and  even gambling. People want to use their bitcoin when it isnt rallying. They want more bitcoin, and alt-coins is probably the biggest market for this, so far. But i think if this thing, bitcoin, catches on in the financial industry, we will start seeing bitcoin blockchain backed instruments that can yield passive and safe returns over time.
