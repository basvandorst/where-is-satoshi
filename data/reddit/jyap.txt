The concept of Bitcoin maximalism is that there is no need for any other public blockchain except for Bitcoin. This may sound extreme but look up the definition for "maximalist".
This also denotes that any other chain is inferior and that any effort expended on another chain is wasted effort against the good of humanity. Meaning that all development effort, all proof of work, all venture capital, all value in the space should go towards Bitcoin.
One argument is that other chains can have features such as smart contracts that Bitcoin will never implement natively. The counter argument that Bitcoin Maximalists state is that such features can be implemented in Bitcoin sidechains.
Since there are also associated connotations with being a Bitcoin Maximalist, it is often the case that they are blamed for certain outcries such as attacking Ethereum or supporting Ethereum Classic. There is an element of truth to this since many Bitcoin Maximalists are vocal in social media.

Omni (USDT Tether is an Omni asset) daemon often has issues and crashes which sends it into maintenance. The Omni team is aware of this.
Please note that:
In most cases you can continue trading if wallet is disabled. If there is an issue that would cause trading concerns, we would turn off the market.

It is unfortunate that this web site is inaccurate and misleading and improperly interprets "no comment" as "B2X non supporters".
