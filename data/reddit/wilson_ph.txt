Thanks a lot. For a second I feared that you'd cite the bullshit definition that is "racism is a system that's based on prejustice and power". I simply can't understand how people are allowed to twist the words' meaning to fit their own agenda.

Alright, sure, I'll agree with you on that. But, just to satisfy my curiosity, do you mind telling me your definition of racism.

What about anifa and their ideology that everyone who's even slightly is against them is a anzi.

I'm sure this [guy]( was a certified Nazi. Or [these]( peaceful protestors were Nazies too? Honestly, the amount of articles that pops up when you search "Antifa attacks innocent victim" is too much.

Didn't antifa hit an innocent guy's head in with a bike lock? Didn't they also beat up a defenceless grandmother.
And I'm pretty sure that bomb you are talking about was proved fake. The "clock' used for it is a car part which doesn't have any timers, alarms or vibration.

Uh the guy that was hit with a bike lock wasn't hit in "self-defence".

You know, labelling people "Nazis" just because you disagree with them is pretty dumb too.

In your opinion, does racism against white people exist?
@_date: 2019-01-11 20:30:48
Now I want you to take a trip to r/Antifa. If you're a rationally thinking person you'll see a lot of baseless accusations.

Sorry if I worded that wrong, english isn't my first language.
Also I want you to read this
I'm sure you'll find a lot more of these if you google antifa attacks/kills innocent person. They're not the "good guys", it feels like they're street thugs that label themselves as "antifa" to excuse their actions.
