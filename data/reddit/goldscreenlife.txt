Is this sarcasm? BTC is up 30% over the last month.

Shame MTL is not Metal AF. That shit is whack,  traded it for more BTC ��
@_date: 2017-09-28 10:59:59
That definitely sounds plausible to me. And that means these manipulating mofos are getting more cash or a better position with each move they make. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 10:11:23
Apologies for my ignorance but when you say people are "short" do you mean in it for short term? Like day trading? And people who are "long" are in it to hodl? 
Or are you talking little people and donkeys?

I was trying to call you out as a sales rep for Trezor, maybe my punctuation was incorrect? Anyway, I was kidding. Good post tbh.

I get you, and yeah, I've see a lot of that in my first couple of months inside the Cryptosphere.

3,000 more BTC ATMs coming to Australia 
@_date: 2017-09-28 10:36:21
TBH I didn't realise that happened. Isn't it weird that so much coin was dumped and the price went up? Shouldn't it go down? 
It often seems like someone is controlling the market. I am predicting everything will drop a shit ton in the next 24 hrs and some people will take nice profits, then we'll see if any of the Chinese news has anymore of an impact going in to October, we will continue the roller coaster that was September but generally upwards, and then segwit is happening in November right? And that's where my crystal ball fux out...

Price USUALLY goes down on the weekend so consider timing your purchases around then.
@_date: 2017-09-22 05:50:19
In these subs I always read:
“If you don’t sell you haven’t lost anything.”
But hey if you NEVER sell then how do you gain anything.  
How do we know this isn’t the beginning of BTC dropping to $100?

We have countless websites and internet software ect. But do we need countless types of coins? Do we even need 5 different coins on the blockchain? 
I'm relatively new to the crypto world so excuse me if I'm way off... I think there is some incredible and necessary tech happening from a lot of the companies who have their own tokens and coins but wouldn't it make more sense if the blockchain just had 1, 2 or 3 at the most different coins or tokens that could flow between each company through the blockchain rather than having a coin for each one?

Just eat more pizza, drink more beer, and exercise less - that should help with the pesky "athletic build" issue.

I can live with that. There's some good music in hell, and anal is big, if you're in to that sort of thing.
And the moon - let's just say "yah yah yah yah"

Thank you, Trezor sales rep.

I wouldn't be surprised if it dips to $3,700 
I'd wait a couple of days.

There is a lot of other solid content in there.

It usually drops as the weekend hits, then goes up during the week. It's also impacted by "big news" either positive or negative. That's my .000002 BTC

YOU think WE will be fine because of what's sitting at YOUR house?

Well that brings more weight to your point I think, thanks for clarifying. 
I don't even own a computer ATM and I have less than 1TB of storage.

"Alt coin holders want to press BTC price down"
Really? Doesn't BTC pull the value of most alt coins with it?

You can't see her face, butt, vagine, you can see a portion of her legs, and her botched tits! How can she be an 8.5? Her tits are a 5 at best, so your score must be reflecting how starved you are.

Do you get a private key once you send your coins to a wallet? I have only a fe hundred invested and at this stage all my coins are on an exchange site called CoinSpot.
