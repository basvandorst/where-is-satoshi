I don't understand why that person harasses you now that Bitcoin is worth $45?
@_date: 2016-05-15 17:47:25
At the end of this long explanation I am still clueless how your giving her $20 worth of Bitcoin which is now $45 is related to her harassing you. I'd sort of understand it if it was the opposite, you gave her Bitcoin and the price went down :)

The hybrid ASIC-friendly PoW + anti-ASIC PoW + PoS seems reasonable.
The conventional view is botnets are bad if they mine, but why really? They are less prone to centralize.

1) I think the legal limit to own was 5 troy ounces, most people didn't have and couldn't afford above that anyway and were not affected. There were few cases of indictments for owning gold, as there was no easy way to enforce that law.

I certainly don't pretend to know the future of Bitcoin. I can identify the direction it is now going is away from decentralization. Can the course be reversed and returned to the path of decentralization? I hope so.

You never asked yourself a question why you have to do it *their* way when it's *your* money. The answer is you don't have to, or you have to because it's not your money and they are kind enough to let you use it.
I don't need fraud protection and the caused inconveniences. I don't care if law requires banks do it, and I can't opt out of it using banks. Bitcoin is a way to opt out not using banks.
If law doesn't let you move your money across borders, the law doesn't think it's your money. It's obvious to anyone with a pea brain. It's not an insult, just saying.
Why can I not travel with large sums of money if it's my money? If I can't do so, the money can be confiscated, it's not my money. Not that I ever had a need to, just saying. Some people need to relocate and they used to bring their cash with them some years ago when money was theirs, now they can't because money is not theirs. Google Cyprus 2013, banks stealing deposits if you haven't heard of it. Bitcoin helps you make money yours again.

Bitcoin is a settlement crypto reserve currency network. Altcoins are for everyday small transactions.
Problem solved.
@_date: 2016-03-12 19:10:05
PoW requires that the hash rate securing the network grows to make the coin safe from 51% attacks. It's almost an axiom, a well known concept.
*Hash rate growth is powered by improvements in ASIC nanochip technology multiplied by energy costs.*
When you hit the physical limits of the ASIC nanochips, it becomes a constant in the above expression. The only variable you can then increase is the mining electricity consumption.
A Bitcoin transaction processing fee is $8 on average, it is now subsidized by block rewards. In the long run, this subsidy goes away, energy costs will have to be pushed on to users. In short, PoW is not only costly to operate, but the costs are ever increasing. Environmentalists are not likely to be pleased with the idea of PoW.

Users don't recognize borders means the government can't stop you from transferring your wealth across borders with crypto currency. Before crypto currency they could stop you, a bank wire or physical cash, gold could be stopped, confiscated at the border.

Usability is slowly becoming an issue with larger fees required to transact everyday small payments, users start migrating to altcoins. It's cheaper and their payments are guaranteed to be included in the next block.

Paypal and banks have all kinds of limits, can't send more than X dollars a day kind of bs. They demand you jump through hula hoops to use their services. If you shop abroad they can freeze your credit card "to protect you", google stories of bitcoin users who had that happen to them and luckily had bitcoin with them to buy necessities. You can't take more than X dollars out of the country (google 'capital controls'). There are a lot of ways they can deny you access to your money. Generally speaking, money in a bank is not your money. Banks allow you to use your money, but your claim to the money you save in a bank has been significantly downgraded in recent years. They can suspend your account under a slightest suspicion and you are helpless. Bitcoin is useful to say f*ck you to banks on all those occasions and many more.

Altcoins stand for reducing dependence on banks, same as Bitcoin. Not everyone has always adhered to the idea of one blockchain. One blockchain is a single point of failure, like what we see now - Bitcoin is failing to achieve social consensus, to the point of a possible split to two competing forks. Competition is a natural instinct of human beings. There are and will be multiple successful crypto currencies.

Make no mistake, Bitcoin is a tool to fight against the tyranny of governments. Don't dream for a second they will not fight it with all means possible if they have to. They fight to be able to tax and steal through inflating their fiat money.

There, fixed it for you.
Changetip is not convenient and has limited applications. The Lightning network doesn't exist. Alts are taking the niche of micro and small payments, and it is good for the free market. The monopoly of Bitcoin is bad, it's almost like the monopoly of fiat of central banks.

He may be clueless, but ultimately he's not wrong. A couple of chinese miners are in control of the cyber boys' toy, so much for decentralization. What will be cyber boys' response, hide their heads in the sand and pretend everything is shiny? Is this not a failure waiting to happen?

You know, the solution to the Byzantine generals problem, a somewhat abstract concept that Bitcoin and alts solve in code to make their existence possible.

If you like comparisons with internet technology. Here is my view of it.
HTTP, SMTP, FTP are higher level protocols on top of the TCP/IP layer.
The consensus protocol is the TCP/IP of crypto currency. Bitcoin and alts are higher application level protocols on top of the consensus protocol. Alts are not redundant, they are complementary, like SMTP, FTP, TELNET are complementary to the full internet experience. HTTP alone is too little.

It's a logic error to conclude that the price has anything to do with the number of transactions. December, 2013 - 8x less  txs per block than today, price 2x more than today. Speculators run this show.

Can anybody logically explain why the mining pools distribution has stayed roughly the same over the past 6 months while the hash rate has doubled?
@_date: 2016-02-16 16:47:12


Probably soon in all possible ways by having mining companies nationalized. I mean who could stop them from immediately grabbing 80% of the Bitcoin hashrate that way? Decentralized Bitcoin of the west will have to fork to a new PoW algo if it happens.
@_date: 2016-02-16 19:14:17
I agree Bitcoin is tiny and won't be touched until the valuation is higher, but the next part of your post is pure hopium. There are no plans to redecentralize anything, how do you even do that without changes to the mining algo hardforking away from nationalized mining operations.

This implies one entity owns about half of the hash rate. It's a rational move on their part to keep up appearances they do not own this much. Is it a rational move on the part of Bitcoin users to pretend mining is decentralized?
@_date: 2016-02-16 07:23:02
Yup. Attempts to get crypto currencies under control will never stop. Banning 500euro notes is only one step.
