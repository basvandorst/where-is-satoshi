I would also use Trezor but, as always with risk, divide the amount to minimize the risk, so one half on the Trezor and another half in one of the paper wallet options offered in other comments (split in different geolocations for example).
Always remember to divide the amount in completely different techniques, whatever are your chosen storage techniques to mitigate the risk.

For Europe, the best overall option is Kraken.com.
Depending on the country you have easier buying options due to better local payments systems (iDeal), but if your best option is SEPA then Kraken has the most volume, very good security and fairly simple sell/purchase interface.

The way the new fees work is, instead of suggesting a default fixed fee, the suggested fee will be calculated from the amount of fees paid on average in the transactions included in last N blocks released, so if someone wants to manipulate the average they'll need to create transactions that pay a high fee and hope to be the lucky miner to get the fee rewards by finding the next block, a very risky and expensive business.

I totally agree and I truly believe competition is always good.
An alternative digital currency (alt-coin?), from a centralized government that -naively- wants to improve on the existing broken financial system and boost financial inclusion is a very nice experiment.
At the end, one of the two economic systems (centralize or decentralized) will show a better performance at country level, but innovation and experimentation is always good and gives perfect examples of either successes to follow or failures and mistakes to avoid.
The result is that we all learn by experimenting, enough of theoretical discussions of good vs bad ;)

These 0 confirmation transactions are a game some people might decide to start playing in the future to make **mini-scams**, and given a very easy way to perform them (like a wallet that double-spends every transaction automatically) I'm sure they will be done.
I subscribe the words of some of the core devs.: 0 confirmations should not be accepted (unless you don't care at all, like in donations)
The best way to do 0 confirmation transactions are the new solutions based on ***multisignature*** and ***payment channels***.
You have a multisig wallet with GreenAddress (they control one of the keys of your address) and you send a payment to Microsoft.
GreenAddress will have no incentives to do a double spend but still Microsoft might/should not trust this third party(centralization...).
Instead, Microsoft &amp; GreenAddress open a payment channel*, since both of them have multiple users in common doing bitcoin transactions, it's better that your transaction goes to a central wallet that GA controls and GA sends the funds to Microsoft simply by updating the transaction in their common payment channel.
(this last part is not yet available afaik)
* **payment channel**:
With this I refer to the capability to send a transaction that gets mined into a block and included in the blockchain but final transaction value can be changed and re-negociated for a period of time (even months) requiring only the consensus of both sender and receiver (no more miners)
This can be currently done with nLockTime transactions and the future CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY should improve it:

In economic clustering tx volume is not the heuristic but, instead, the previously known and signed transactions are the filtering mechanism. Because these known transactions have signed references to previous valid blocks/txs they can not be included in the fake 'history attack' chain (or any other chain), so these transactions look to me as personal lists of automatic checkpoints.
Is there any known way to bypass this check without making all the economy participants sign their transactions again for the attacker chain?

This is the best explanation of mining that I know, the first time I heard it was from Adam B. Levine in a LetsTalkBitcoin show last year.
It's very effective and my real experience using it was with a +50 years old stranger with little expertise in computers that approached me in a Bitcoin meetup, he said "I want you to help me to become rich with this bitcoin creation system". After I explained the lottery analogy and how many tickets would be needed to get a very slim chance of recovering the investment he changed his decision 180 degrees.
I'm very happy he did :)

Yes, the first two transactions N and M have to wait for at least 1 confirmation, that is how payment channels are designed.
How this should work: customer sends funds to (*fills the wallet*) M1 for 0 confirmation transactions she is willing to make at some point in the future before the expiration date that she set herself. Then, after that filling of the wallet is confirmed, it's ready to use in the future with any merchant that also established a relationship with NoRiskWallet.

I already commented on the Impulse proposal that I see it as the same trust model as the GreenAddress instant transactions. Although now I understand it's an improvement from GA in the sense that they separate the wallet from the instant transaction service.

I love this, it's like a puzzle :)
In your scenario now D and A can align to trick B into signing the transaction to pay to D but D doesn't sign the transaction to return the funds to B in their B-D channel. So at the end A sent funds to D at the expense of B.

Each Firefox extension goes through a full review process on their first release and each new version needs a new "human" review.
I personally experienced this as developer of the Bitcoin Price Ticker  (also with Doge prices) 
The first review took weeks and several versions to reach a quality and security level the reviewers were comfortable with. They are very careful to accept large code that is not clear what it does or reject code that does something different than what is in the description of the add-on.
It is still possible to have spam in Firefox add-ons but the chances are much lower and you don't have to pay any fee to contribute to an app store.
If someone ones to port the code from Firefox to a Chrome extension here are all the sources:

Indeed, it's centralized because it doesn't matter to the customer/merchant if the service is hacked, I guess it will be better to have it federated (a few nodes better than a single place with lots of funds owned by the service for collaterals).
I guess it could be possible to crowdfund the service but we haven't figured that out yet.

@_date: 2015-01-18 14:49:01
Cool, I think I got your concept (some neurons died trying to battle the idea :P)
So this is my own explanation of the idea:
- *A* wants to pay *D* so *A* establishes first a payment channel with *B* for value 100 (and returning those 100 back to *A* as explained in the paper in transaction **TR2**). *A* obtains the double signed transaction **TR2** but doesn't broadcast it to the network.
- *A* opens payment channel with *B* sending 100 funds from *A* to multisig address *A1* in **TF1** (same as in paper). Broadcasted to the network.
- *A* now sends *B* the address of *D* where *A* wants to send money and how much, so *B* can generate a new multisig 2of2 address(*M1*) for the payment channel between *B* and *D*.
- Then *B* creates a new transaction(**TP3**) that overwrites the refund transaction(**TR2**) and sends 50 funds back from *A1* to *A* and 50 to *M1* (controlled by *B* and *D*). This is similar to the paper but instead of **TP3** paying to the address provided by *D*, 50 funds from *A* will go to the multisig address(*M1*) controlled by *B* and *D*.
- Now instead of *A* and *B* just signing the transaction (**TP3**),  *B* keeps this transaction(**TP3**) to himself for now until the end. **TP3** makes **TR2** invalid.
- *B* opens a payment channel with *D* in *M1* for the same value, 50 funds: First, *B* sends *D* a signed refund transaction(**TR4**) to return 50 funds from *M1* to *B*, this will be locked to some point in the future and depend on 50 funds sent by *B* as collateral. Second, *D* sends back to *B* the double signed refund transaction(**TR4**). *B* now opens the payment channel with *D* by sending the 50 funds to *M1* in **TF5**. *D* now has 50 funds from *B* locked in *M1*(collateral that forces *B* to not sign any new version of **TP3**) and a refund transaction(**TR4**) to return 50 funds to *B* at some point in the future if something goes wrong. Only **TF5** is released to the network with both signatures.
- *B* creates a new transaction(**TP6**) that sends the 50 funds in *M1* coming from **TP3** to himself(*B*) and the 50 funds in *M1* coming from **TF5** to *D*. **TP6** makes **TR4** invalid.
- Finally the signing: first *D* signs and broadcasts **TP6**(already signed by *B*) that sends (from *M1*) 50 funds to *B* and 50 funds to *D*, secondly, *B* signs **TP3**(not yet signed by *A*) that sends 50 funds to *M1* instead of **TR2**, finally, *A* sees that everything is alright, signs and broadcasts **TP3** and both transactions (**TP3** and **TP6**) become valid.
Is there anyone that understand this?
The requirement for this to work is that *B* needs to have payment channels already opened with both *A* and *D*, otherwise both **TF1** and **TF5** could be double spent
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:11:25
The pleasure was mine, I never worked with such a dedicated team.
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:17:18


Yes, NoRiskWallet has to put money from its pocket to game theoretically prove they won't do a double spend.
How NoRiskWallet stores its own funds is something services like BitPay or Coinbase know how to do well at scale.
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:18:40
Sorry, this prototype doesn't include judgment day insurances.
By the way, it also doesn't ensure the merchant delivers the goods to the customer after paying.
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:27:29
Almost, the second 100$ (collateral) is not put by the customer but by the service(NoRiskWallet), and at the end 100$ go back to the NoRiskWallet.
@_date: 2015-01-28 11:44:13
Yes, there was a missing piece in that puzzle, an extra transaction paying the collateral in the future from B to C (D in that post), in case B wants to do a double spend together with A against the merchant.
If everything is fine and not double spent, then C can't use the collateral because the funds are already in their correct destination, but when A+B do a double spend C gets the funds from B at some point in the future.
@_date: 2015-01-18 12:01:52
An improvement in trust over the 10 minutes block confirmation.
Nevertheless, the person receiving the money still has to trust the payment processor (B) or GreenAddress to not be aligned with payer (A) on overwriting the payment.
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:30:57
So if I understand correctly, not only a user can do micropayments in the system you describe but it also generates a *0 confirmation* payment system between the consumer and the merchant (through the hub), because there is no way to double spend that transaction.
Is this correct?
@_date: 2015-01-18 23:10:37
There are solutions to keep up with micropayments, we don't need to put in the blockchain every single transaction we make in order to have our daily transactions secured by the blockchain.
Here is the Bitcoin micropayment channel:
And here a nice new proposal to improve 0 confirmation payments with them:
@_date: 2015-01-08 23:41:15
I can't even get the web to load, so although I can't judge the design I can consider it already a failure.
Here is my attempt to explain Bitcoin basics:
I'm not a designer or user experience expert, I just tried to use the idea I believe in: learn something by playing with it, in this case Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-18 11:44:53
This is what I understand for a micropayment channel:
- I send you a transaction(1) that sends some money from me to you but the trick is that you still haven't sent me THAT money, so you can't yet get the money(and now you have the right to get your money back sometime in the future) - The moment you release Transaction 1 to the Bitcoin network you get your money back 
- Now you send me the actual money in a transaction(2) (knowing that you have the right to return it to yourself any time you want but you still keep the return transaction(1) locally in your PC to use it only when needed) - Transaction(2) is released to the network so everybody knows you sent me the money
- The magic is: instead you of releasing the refund transaction(1), you send a new version of the transaction(1) that returns almost all the money to yourself, just like before, except now a part of that money STAYS with me. If I agree with this new transaction(3) (obviously I agree with keeping more money than before), then I can sign the new transaction(3) and send it to you - No new transaction has been released to the Bitcoin network.
- Finally, we both can keep repeating the magic step and send new versions of the refund transaction(1). If you send new versions were I can keep MORE money, I will always agree. If I send you a new version were I can keep LESS money, you'll always agree. The newest version agreed upon by both parties is the one executed when released to the Bitcoin network
The twist in the plot to make 0 confirmation transaction (if I understand correctly) is that the new version of the transaction(1) can split the money in more destinations, example: most money coming back to you, some money stays with me and some money goes to third person(Bob).
*Note*: In the implementation discussed in the paper the third person being paid, **Bob, has to trust that you and I will not align to send a new version of the transaction that pays nothing to Bob**.
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:06:38


Yes, that's the purpose of the deposit/collateral the NoRiskWallet has to put, it proves that a double spend is counter productive for a NoRiskWallet service and the merchant still receives the funds regardless of the double spend.
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:20:02
Yes, you're totally right, the service costs 4x 1 transaction fee, so it's not incredibly expensive but also not cheap.
On this project we haven't worked out any of the business models, this is just a crazy idea ;)
@_date: 2015-01-28 23:18:13
Transactions are linked, if transactions X and Y in the diagram are signed and released to the blockchain, transaction Z will eventually become invalid (after X and Y are confirmed, ~10mins), otherwise if A+B try to double spent transaction X(making Y invalid), then C will eventually receive the money from transaction Z when it reaches the date set in the transaction.
You don't need to trust the code in the server(it could be also hacked), if that happens either all funds return to original owners and C doesn't deliver the goods (because it didn't receive a proof of payment) or C receives the payment and there is nothing the hacked server can do to prevent it without C's approval.
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:23:40
Nothing here stops that, but that empty block doesn't affect this solution neither as long as one of the next close blocks includes the transaction.
If all the bitcoin confirmed blocks are empty for a long period of time (hours), then this service will miserably fail. But in that case I imagine it will not be the only service that miserably fails.
@_date: 2015-01-18 12:20:39
The improvement over GreenWallet is that the transaction is separated from the wallet.
Now the crazy questions:
- Since the transaction can be executed by any of the parties (A, B or D+) that receives the doubled signed transaction
- and all D receivers trust B
- can A still send new versions of the transaction to B paying to even more third parties?
- and can all these transactions to D+ be smaller than the payment fees?
This means you can have a payment processor B that allows you to do 0 confirmation micropayments (without the need to open a new micropayment channel for each micropayment to a new receiver D)
Note: Each new version of the tx should have a smaller lock time (sooner in the future), to make sure the last version is the one executed first.
@_date: 2015-01-28 12:27:30
Then C(the merchant) should not deliver the goods until there is at least 1 (or more depends on the merchant's policy) confirmation on the blockchain.
Transaction Z is the insurance for the merchant to accept the 0 confirmation transaction.
@_date: 2015-01-18 22:15:07
I omitted the multisig and the time locks to simplify the explanation, but indeed they are totally needed.
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:25:37
Sincerely, I have no idea, we don't have a company or business plan to make profits, etc. Some people suggested fees, other suggested asking for loans...
This is just a crazy idea and the prototype code to build it.

This is what I understand from the first part (until 'closing a payment channel'):
- I send you a transaction(1) that sends to you some money from an address controlled by you and me(A1) but the trick is that you still haven't sent that money to A1, so you can't yet get the money(and now you have the right to get your money back sometime in the future)
- Now you send the actual money in a transaction(2) to A1 (knowing that you have the right to return it to yourself any time you want but you still keep the return transaction locally in your PC to use it only when needed)
- To pay a third person(Bob), you send a new version of the first transaction(1) that returns almost all the money to yourself, just like before, except now a part of that money is sent to Bob
- Finally, I sign/agree to this last transaction and broadcast it to the network
The part I don't understand is how this last transaction is 0 confirmed, is it already included in a block before I sign it?
The doubts I have with this, if the last transaction still has to be included in a block after broadcasting it:
- How is Bob sure that you and I are not going to double spend the transaction paying Bob with yet another version of it?
- How is this better/different from the GreenAddress approach to combine signatures of A and B to make a single payment transaction to Bob?
Maybe I don't understand what is a payment channel, is there any place to find an explanation of how they work? - Found it: 
Thanks and great job!

So if I understand correctly:
- Currently D prays that A doesn't do a double spend
- With Impulse proposal, D hopes A and B don't work together to trick him/her
- With you proposal, D hopes that A+B1+B2...+BN don't work together to trick him/her
Here is another proposal to pay without trust and without introducing more intermediaries (and fees): 
Basically, B has to put a collateral for the transaction.

Then maybe you're interested in this project to decentralize music markets

Here is my attempt to explain exactly what your title describes in a interactive web:

That is actually a windows security problem that mobile phones drastically improved upon.
I actually believe a downloaded application is more decentralized and efficient than a developer paying and maintaining a web application that is easy to take down or block by a government or ISP.

I use kodi with a cheap Chinese TV remote and it works perfectly, my girlfriend uses it without any problems and even my parents used it weekly on my old Xbox a few years ago.
The remote:

Solved, thanks, the update was good but I needed to 'forget' device and reconnect it to see version 1.3.1 in the web browser

Awesome idea!
I have been thinking/wishing for the integration between telegram and changetip for a while and this project already delivers that and more.
Well done!

Great initiative, kudos for it!

Great for the open source, I'm totally ok with not releasing not ready code ;)
So the way I imagine the risk management in the network is as follows:
Hubs have 1-1 trust relationships, so to break that trust a hub can collaborate with a user or another hub to double spend a transaction. 
Since transactions have very small amount of value and they flow in a chain of hubs, in this attack scenario only a small amount will be affected and, instead of the merchant, the victim being double spent will be another intermediary hub. Immediately after this trust is broken, the attacking hub/customer will be banned from the network of trusted hubs.
Is this how it should work?

Very exciting and useful project!
Is there any information about how the trust on hubs work or is that part of the closed source?
I'm very curious about the risk factors the actors have (consumer/merchant/hub) and I was deeply exploring these attacks as part of this project:

My point is still the same, with getgems you need to convince your friends to install a new app to start using it.
It took me months to install the facebook messenger and I did it only after facebook threatened me to loose the ability to send messages through their network unless I installed the app.
@_date: 2015-02-18 16:07:27
The issue with all new messaging apps is that they require all your social network to install it in order to be useful.
It already takes me time and effort to convince my friends/family to use telegram (that works on PCs and tablets) instead of the omnipresent Whatsapp.

From this explanation I imagined that payments from the payment hub to merchants will be linked to transactions from the customer over the payment channel to the hub. Therefore, when the two linked transactions are released to the Bitcoin network, malleability can be a problem.
Is this assumption completely wrong or is there another factor that alleviates this problem?
