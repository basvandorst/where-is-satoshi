Bitcoin or debt... tough decision...

Great to have this list, but the edge wallet from the Airbitz developers is missing.

Just out of interest: Why would technically an address generator web page be more insecure than a software wallet? It might be that it's more likely to be a trap than a wallet listet on [bitcoin.org]( but technically it's the same and you have to trust the wallet generator in the web page / software wallet, isn't it?

Just out of interest: Would a normal protocol update allow to divide satoshis even more, or would that require an (probably unwanted) hard fork / new chain?

Thanks for this insight!

Breadwallet is great, although Segwit is missing, Edge is great and with Segwit.. choose whatever feels better for you.

At first I thought "That's what's wrong with the btc community.", but after trying I really enjoyed the answers, humorous yet accurate in a way... ;)

Exactly. I'm all in for Bitcoin, but these made-up arguments won't help the cause.

What a nonsense statement.  
Every year that I survive, it demonstrates the resilience and robustness of the food, drinks, clothing and way of life that supports it.  
That is, until I die.  
I'm a friend of bitcoin, but I can't stand this utter nonsense just to hype oneself up.

That's of course true. Two things that come to mind without giving too much thought:
1. Only one passphrase for as much information (wallets) as I want.
2. A passphrase I can remember, unlike a seed a or key. 
Of course I can start now to think about "what happens if I can't remember/brain damage" etc., but that's just the equivalent to fire etc.

How about implementing Segwit?

Might be not so popular, but I don't see a reason why keeping your keys in an encrypted file on any cloud provider could be an issue - that's the way to go for me.
If I trust the encryption in bitcoin, I'll also trust the encryption of my container.
Sure thing: I won't encrypt/decrypt it on a hot computer to avoid key-logging, but "theoratically" everyone is free to have my encrypted file containing all keys ;)

My bitcoin was worth 20.000$ so its better than yours, nanananana :P
