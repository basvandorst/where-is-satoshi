Inflation averages about 2% per year, which is an intentional target.  Yes, that is pretty stable.
Purchasing power is pretty stable too.  You're confusing the value of the dollar with the ability of people to possess enough of those dollars to buy things.  Yes, that's a problem, but it isn't a problem with the currency.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:17:08
It's more than a belief system.  It's backed by the fact that every store accepts it, every employer pays it, and the IRS collects their taxes in it.  It holds value precisely because it has no domestic competition, because it is stable, and because it will exist as long as the US Government does.

You're joking, right?
You're not literally so dumb that you think the stock market and the USD are the same thing, and that the stock market volatility is the same thing as "currency volatility"?
If we're in 2009, my retirement has been fucked for the next few years but my bank accounts are fine.  My currency still has +-5% of the buying power it had a few months previously.  I can still buy groceries with it.
Try that with bitcoin.  The insane financial illiteracy around here tells me all I need to know about the bitcoin market.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:38:15


Lol, total bullshit.  The value hasn't even swung 40% in 15 years much less a few months.
You can zoom in on both those charts.  There aren't any massive swings being hidden by the timescale.  But honestly, this statement is so obviously absurd that I'm almost convinced you're deliberately arguing in bad faith.  Would you mind explaining how you became convinced that the value of USD often swings 40% up and down?


That is not an investment (or, at least, it's the lowest and least "investment"-like form of investment).  That is saving to buy an investment, such as a house or car.  People don't put that money in the bank for the purpose of getting a return on their "investment", thet put it there for safekeeping while it is not being used for other useful things.

Of course.  Because USD is a *functioning currency* and Bitcoin is a *speculative commodity*.
It's totally useless to talk about "holding fiat" as though it were an investment.  Please, for the love of God, I **hope** the value of my *currency* doesn't change that quickly.  Even 2% deflation would be terrible for USD, much less 2,000%.  What an apples-to-oranges comparison.

So, instead they plan on giving all that power to a small set of capitalists, who have to protect their business interests.  Without common law enforcement provided by governments, this basically means they would want their own private enforcement.  And all the other citizens need law enforcement too, so either they pay said private security firms or they get fucked over by criminals.
Gee this is starting to sound a lot like feudalism, narco-syndicate controlled Mexico, or warlord-controlled Somalia.  But at least there's no "central authority" with a "monopoly on violence" to oppress them.

Don't exaggerate. It would be worth about 82% of its value from 10 years prior.
$100 dollars in 2017 is roughly equivalent to $86.50 from 2007.
$100 dollars in 2007 is roughly equivalent to $80 from $1997.
To get to half of the purchasing power, you have to wait about 30 years.  $100 in 1989 is roughly equivalent to $50 in 2017.

That's the point.  It encourages economic investment and not just putting every penny in a bank account never to be touched.  I'm not going to freak out about losing 1% per year, though.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:56:30
If you could read, you would have noticed that I said "rapidly".
Inflation is roughly 2% per year.  That isn't fast.  But more importantly it's stable and predictable.
Volatility won't go away until people treat it like an actual currency instead of an investment.  Bit of a chicken and egg problem.  And even then, it won't be as stable as fiat currency because, as everyone here loves to jerk off about, it isn't controlled by a central bank

@_date: 2017-12-08 23:54:37
 1) Bitcoin doesn't always go up.  I shouldn't really need to say that.
 2) Inflation is not a big deal except over the long term
2a)  This encourages economic investment instead of just leaving your money in the bank.  This is a good thing.  Especially if it happens at a constant and highly predicable rate.
2b)  Deflationary currency does the exact opposite.  Why spend money on anything if the value is going to keep rising in the bank.  Why invest it if sitting in the bank is itself an investment (for yourself, but it's doing nothing economically useful).
 3)  You are completely and utterly delusional if you think the US dollar is going to be outlawed.  Also, are you completely ignorant of the fact that it's already traded electronically all the time?  Its existence isn't tied to paper...
