... 'Cache' is pronounced like 'Cash'?
I've been saying it wrong my whole life...

What people are imagining = Bitfinex burning to the ground and taking everyone else with it
What will likely happen = Bitfinex is fined 10 BTC and told not to do it again

Like "catch" - "ch" making it's usual sound.

And? I seriously doubt a merchant is going to reject a bitcoin because it was used to buy drugs four years ago  - would a merchant reject cash because it has a trace about of cocaine on it? If so, they'd have to reject the overwhelming majority of cash.


Very true when dealing with large amounts, but what about smaller amounts? Admittedly, people don't often carry small amounts of gold with them in the modern world (though I'm betting people misplaced gold coins all the time when they were in common use) but the average person will lose $600 in change over their lifetime. 


Fair point.
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:03:42
Fungability: uh... blacklisting bitcoin is far less common than marked bills are. Why did cash get the higher number?
Non-consumable: Gold and Cash physically exist, meaning they can both be misplaced in the physical world with no way of retrieving it. Why isn't this counted against them, if a wrong address is counted against bitcoin? (Also, USD is not actually made of paper)
Predictable supply and value: I notice you counted gold's unpredictable supply against it (you don't really know how much gold there is in the world overall, we don't know when mining asteroids will be a thing, etc) but you didn't count bitcoins predictable supply towards it. Bitcoin has a VERY predictable *supply*, it is only *value* that is volatile.
Transactable: How could I transact highly divided gold without specialized equipment? How can I transact gold at all if merchants don't take it as payment? Transacting gold and cash both require physical presence of all parties and the gold or cash itself.

A theory requires evidence.
Or did you mean "hypothesis?"

...do you know what a ferengi is?
I'll just say that "experience in successful business" is more of a conformation of the ferengi stereotype, not a rejection.  Though, the most ferengi country is of course, 'merica \- after all, they were litterally based on 20th century Americans.

Who still carries cash?

Yeah, two zoomed in lines of code. That's total proof.
Seriously, when someone we know to be dishonest accuses an unknown, the burden of proof is on the dishonest person to prove they're not dishonest today. Especially when he stands to gain from the result.
@_date: 2018-06-09 19:17:19


Lol you took that seriously? Flying spaghetti monster...
Did you also take my comment about google seriously?


Sure... if that someone else is unbiased, which a competitor of whoever wrote the code would clearly not be. Why is that so difficult a concept to grasp?


Again, that code came from someone who stands to gain if his claims are true. He could've wrote it himself.


As long as you insist on attacking, I'm forced to continue to defend. You replied to my post on the offensive, thus I had to counter, and you reply again and again and again...
The real question is why are YOU so adamant on this. Surely you don't care about my opinion this much?

Do you know the concept of a self-fulfilling prophecy?
If enough people say that bitcoin will reach some crazy price, more people will believe it to be true, then more people will buy bitcoin, causing to reach some crazy price.

Yeah, let's just blindly trust what someone says about their own competition.

I actually tried to buy during the dip. Problem was the dip was long over by the time my deposit went through.
People actually claim BTC transactions are too slow when moving USD takes 10+ days?!

It was GDAX that took that long.

That fiat (or any money, period) is somehow more real than bitcoin.
Any medium of exchange is worth something because we all agree to pretend it is. 
The misconception isn't about bitcoin, but about all other forms of currency.

"Ownership" is more of a legal thing, control is more practical.
Ex: if you have the keys to the car, but I have the title, which one of us really owns it?

True, but only one of my arguments (1859) was based on the prediction being correct - and I believe that to be more likely than Drake simply having made a lucky guess to find oil. I'd argue most of these statements weren't the best - not simply because they were wrong, but because most of them didn't consider the evidence available to them at the time.
Take this quote:
“You would make a ship sail against the winds and currents by lighting a bonfire under her decks? I have no time for such nonsense.” ― Napoléon Bonaparte
Napoléon thought the concept sounded so absurd that he simply dismissed it without thinking it through all the way - it's not as though no one had ever moved an object by using heat energy before. This is why the quote doesn't highlight his finest hour, not simply him being proven wrong.
Or this quote:
"Stay away from it. It's a mirage, basically," - Warren Buffet on Bitcoin
His entire arguement is that Bitcoin isn't real. Except... all money isn't real. Money is like math or love - something humans made up - in this case, to make it easier to turn one type of value into another. Dollars, gold, and bitcoin only have value because we agree to say it does. So technically speaking, Buffet isn't "wrong". But the statement itself is stupid, especially so because we know the person who said it is smart enough to know better, and that would not change even if bitcoin fell to zero tomorrow.
Flying cars do exist, by the way. They're just really expensive and really impractical. Sorta like regular cars in 1903...
@_date: 2018-03-22 08:36:46
Well... that doesn't sound right to me. First, we do not live in a society that favors poor people. I would imagine if anything it would be reversed.
Second, that wouldn't make sense if it were true, because there are a lot more small transactions than large ones. If that was the case (flag large transactions, don't care about small ones) then the ratings would be like 94%, not 50/50.
@_date: 2018-07-11 17:36:17
If he tells us to buy some people who weren't going to buy now will, thus making his prediction more likely to be true.
@_date: 2018-07-02 15:21:51
That'll teach ya, Buffet.
@_date: 2018-07-13 16:29:31
Uh, you are assuming that he will receive a substantial amount of BTC payments that would otherwise be in fiat, to the point that he'd have to sell to pay his bills. That is unlikely at this stage.
Furthermore, if he were to reach a point sometime in the future in which a substantial portion of his revenue was in BTC, then he likely could pay some of his bills in BTC because if adoption was that high, then some of the companies that he pays bills to would also accept BTC as well.
@_date: 2018-07-15 17:39:01
Did you read your own post? You clearly said "unless he can pay his rent or his light bill or his insurance with bitcoin", but that assumes that he would NOT be able to pay his bills if he held all the BTC he received. Sististally, it is very unlikely that he'd receive enough BTC payments for that to be an issue - 99%+ of his payments would still be in fiat.
Also, the word "IF" does not appear in the post I replied to. You did not say if.

Stability does not make an investment good.
It makes a store of value better, but not a good investment. Investments pay based on risk - little risk, little return. No risk, no return.

1800: Yet the statement was not "we aren't sure if rail travel at high speed is possible", it flat out stated that it was impossible AND that it would never be possible. The statement was indeed stupid. It's like saying that aliens don't exist just because no human has ever met one.
1859: How do you know the context of the statement? It is presented as "oil drilling is a stupid idea" not "looking for oil and hoping it's there" is stupid. Surely Drake had a reasonable way to see of oil might be there beyond "lucky guesses" (after all, he DID find oil).
1876: You can't assume that the current limitations of a technology will always be present, especially if the tech in question is new. The first guns sucked compared to bow &amp; arrow. The first calculator sucked compared to abacus. Thus, assuming phones would never evolve was absurd.
1880: See 1876.
1902: See 1876.
1903: See 1876.
1916: He said that Tanks would NEVER replace cavalry, not merely that they sucked in 1916. See 1876. I also notice you left off Chaplin claiming movies were a fad.
1921: The statement had nothing to do with the small audience size, but rather that anything on the radio was not sent to ONE specific person, but anyone who got the signal. The speaker totally missed the point of the radio to begin with.
1946: Again, he said people would get tired of it - his arguement does not rely on audience size at all. Also the speaker was a movie producer... kinda the equivalent of a TV station owner today claiming people will get tired of video games. There's a decent chance he's lying through his teeth to defend his own medium.
1977: 1977, not 1967. Computers were well within single room size at this point and the VIC-20 was but 3 years away.

Define "Legal". There is more than one level of legality.
Level 0 - Banned. Possession or use of Bitcoin is against the law.
Level 1 - Unrecognized. One may use Bitcoin as they wish, but no one is under obligation to accept it.
Level 2 - Recognized. If you attempt to pay a debt with Bitcoin, they may not reject it and then later claim nonpayment.
Level 3 - Mandated. It is illegal to NOT have Bitcoin. Mostly theoretical, as few (any?) nations even mandate their own fiat currency.
