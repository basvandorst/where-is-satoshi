Not if I write it down. "5: c, 13: y, 27: 7" etc.


This defeats the whole purpose. I can still access it whenever I please, I want to make it nearly impossible for me to access it until specified date. I appreciate your help though!

Just how would it be easy to bruteforce if I replace, say 8 digits?
I don't make it obvious in the e-mail what the text string is for, and it's not like it's going to be public either for people tro try and bruteforce. The only one having access to my obscured private key would be the admin of the e-mail service. Only I can restore it since I store part of it somewhere else.

Thanks! I will try to understand exactly how to utilize this.

Like I said, I would not give them my private key. I would replace a couple of digits with something else, and then store them at my place. I was also planning on using all of the sites, because it's fairly unlikely that all of them will be out of service, at least one of them have been around since 2002.


I never invest more than I can afford to lose, but when I invest I always cash out when I've made around 20% profit because I tell myself "no way it's gonna keep going". If I had locked away the BTC I bought many years ago I would be able to buy a house today. My initial idea was to invest long term, but insecurity made me sell and miss out.

Thank you for this! I just need to study closer how it works. :)
