lieferservice.at is still accepting BTC, keep calm Austrians :)

anybody wants to bet when we will reach 100bn?
@_date: 2014-06-04 09:22:54
very clear and easy to handle. I like.
@_date: 2014-12-12 14:42:50
yeah that's what annoys me as well about the article, quite negative towards the end.
@_date: 2014-12-08 17:37:57
As a German, that makes me sad and a little bit angry...
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:17:22
and you are already ~10% up. welcome to the ride!
@_date: 2014-06-05 13:27:47
maybe. but true solving of environmental problems requires also a change in the consumption pattern of society to reduce material throughput.
@_date: 2014-05-29 07:36:39
had the same plan, but the fee stops me right now. maybe you should make it free or less for some weeks.
@_date: 2014-06-05 12:15:42
Nice research. The only question left open is how sustainable and exponentially increasing system like Bitcoin will be in the next decades. Prices for energy will go up with decreasing fossil resources in the near future. 100% Renewable Energy won't be reached that soon.
@_date: 2014-07-14 16:43:58
thank you for the good advices
@_date: 2014-07-05 11:49:17

it seems like you don't know how the alphabet works
@_date: 2014-06-22 14:22:12
pretty sure. otherwise the irony wouldn't work... -.-
@_date: 2014-05-29 14:32:13
Awesome! Will definitely check it out soon.

@_date: 2017-02-10 18:39:58
I visited them a couple of weeks ago and had a nice talk with one of their team members. Let's see how it turns out for them, will be hard to make enough money to sustain. Good job and good luck!
@_date: 2015-05-25 14:08:24
too great to be true... yet
@_date: 2015-01-03 00:19:52

phew, its just the Euro. 1000 bits

@_date: 2015-01-12 12:37:32
Never understood why it wasn't seen as an altcoin before.
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:37:12
long-term dude, long-term

@_date: 2017-08-02 00:31:54
had the same problem. looks like a minor bug, I refreshed and it was fixed again.
@_date: 2017-08-09 10:21:38
what is the physical nm limit of an ASIC?
@_date: 2017-01-21 18:05:17
RemindMe! 25 years
@_date: 2017-01-14 15:44:10
Awesome! I will check it out the day you guys open!
@_date: 2017-01-16 14:36:39
any educated guesses what yould be the reason?
@_date: 2017-01-18 11:02:03
it's truely a miracle that he did not drown in pussy by now
@_date: 2017-08-08 10:43:33
You can only withdraw up to 0.025 BTC as an unverified user. The limit used to be higher before.
Edit: daily
@_date: 2017-01-22 13:07:12
finally we will see china's real trading volume
@_date: 2016-11-23 19:26:46
what is the relative transaction fee? absolute fee does not say much
@_date: 2016-11-18 08:48:37
and 1st block not signaled to support SegWit. It's over guys, bitcoin is dead. Again.
@_date: 2016-11-23 21:11:48
I guess I looked at the block before the one you looked at. I am using tradeblock.com which gives you the average directly.
@_date: 2016-11-09 10:43:05
I missed you!
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:33:10
it was before 12:20, irrelevant.
@_date: 2016-11-05 21:19:43
Try the Local Trader in Mycelium App. I just had a look and there are some sellers
@_date: 2016-11-03 18:47:00
rising quickly, dropping quickly. welcome to bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-11-18 09:02:16
pretty sure I read somewhere that block  is the first potential one
@_date: 2016-11-03 07:47:50
still a very long way to the absolute majority
@_date: 2016-11-23 19:36:52
considering, that last block had an average of 70.8 sat/byte, this is weird. who can explain?
@_date: 2017-01-08 19:12:21
no mentioning of "guns" or "drugs". I was pleased.
@_date: 2016-11-04 23:40:55
Mycelium Local Trader, for Android

@_date: 2019-10-02 03:16:51
Same one can be found at the main station in Frankfurt.
@_date: 2016-11-03 12:18:38

@_date: 2015-08-26 10:29:11

Mycelium app (android)
@_date: 2019-06-01 20:00:05
It is, works smoothly in my European major city.
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:30:31
first you fork, then you spoon
@_date: 2015-07-22 07:26:41
Amazing that it took 10 more years
@_date: 2017-04-23 12:19:29
Hopefully a scam

Thank you for the continuous good work, !lntip 1000
@_date: 2018-07-30 15:42:55
Except it's getting smaller over time.
@_date: 2015-10-14 16:18:17
coinbase -&gt; wallet app (e.g. Mycelium/Breadwallet) -&gt; betting site and vice versa?
@_date: 2015-10-14 16:25:06
I'm using Mycelium for Android on a daily basis. Never had a problem over the last 6 months.
Not sure tho if they still can trace it.
@_date: 2015-10-14 16:26:43
Okay, I didn't know that.
@_date: 2015-10-30 11:28:44
you gotta love that guy!
@_date: 2017-07-15 11:37:20
I've realized that as well. Leading to huge txfees right now, what's going on?
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:47:16
Stop it!
@_date: 2015-03-27 11:08:30
"I have my line, I'm sticking with it" Well, maybe some deeper research would open his eyes but with this attitude it's not gonna happen.
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:04:09
their fee calculation is broken for months. it's a shame, otherwise it's a great wallet.
@_date: 2015-02-10 14:11:38
please report :)
@_date: 2015-02-25 09:23:15
what an advanced technology, so 20th century.
@_date: 2015-02-25 08:35:49
exactly, namely Austria and Switzerland
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:46:13
Hodl. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:38:22
great work so far!
@_date: 2015-02-11 12:03:12
normal cryptsy. happened to me regulary, just wait.
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:54:40
which wallet is there to use to import your seed safely, take the BCC and sell them asap?
@_date: 2015-02-24 16:17:16
ha, no but had the pleasure to visit your beautiful country last year and read it somewhere
@_date: 2015-02-12 10:06:05
[Welcome back!](
@_date: 2015-02-12 09:53:12
not sure if serious...
@_date: 2015-02-12 12:21:50
as long as it is used it will grow, though Moore's law will be helping out. hopefully.
@_date: 2015-02-10 10:16:18
it's written in the FAQs


which means they add a commission for (1) the vendor, (2) the owner of the POS infrastructure and for (3) themselves (Coinfinity) including sales tax
@_date: 2015-02-19 14:54:59
I do not see how that can be positive for bitcoin in the long run
@_date: 2015-03-24 09:05:13
We will find out, next crash is coming for sure. Current monetary system, ECB and banksters will ensure it.
@_date: 2018-12-12 19:55:54
this headline sounds shady af
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:08:54
I'm on android only, but breadwallet is recommended a lot around here.
