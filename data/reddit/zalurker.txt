Like I said before.
Only invest what you can walk away from. Keep some of the money you wanted to invest in a jar, to buy beer with if you get wiped out.
This is Black Friday, time to separate the Kids from the Adults. Or as Warren Buffet once said 'The tide is going out, and now we'll see who has been skinny dipping.'

Its simple. Do not sell your house, car and pawn all your stuff to buy Bitcoin. Do not cash your pension to buy Bitcoin.
Spend what you can afford to lose. If tomorrow it crashes, you should be able to go drown your sorrows in a beer and move on. In fact, take some of the money you planned to use to buy, and put it in a beer jar, so you have that available. Buy what you can afford, buy low and do not try and read the market. There is no system to predicting the price.

Tulip Manis was a non-event, that only affected a small group and had no effect on the economy.

South African here.
This sounds a bit too much like fake news to me.
