No it didn't.  I did buy the absolute cheapest Macbook Pro you can get though.  I get that this usb-c port might be the way of the future but damn I knew I was going to run into a ton of these frustrations.

I'm nowhere close to an expert on this but I'm almost positive your energy bill would be much greater than the 200 in rent

When can we see the article about what futures did to gold?  Or maybe you can clue us in here?  That is going to be an interesting read.

I really want a correction right now so my dollars might be worth more than a mere sliver of a coin :(

That party they are having right now must be insane.  Jordan Belfort style

I am also concerned but have no insight on what to expect.  From what I've been reading the futures are supposed to make the price less volatile but could also make it much more volatile in the short term.  Might have an opportunity to get some cheaper coins.

LibertyX.com.  Fee's are high as well though but you go to a physical store and the coin in transferred into your wallet quickly

Basically two parties agree to buy/sell Bitcoin at a future date for a certain price no matter what the spot trading price is.  This can be used by miners to hedge their investment in energy consumption in case the price goes down.  Say the price of a coin is $15,000.  One party (The miner) would agree to sell one Bitcoin for $14,000 and the other agree's to buying a Bitcoin at $16,000 if they think the price would continually rise.  If the price continues to rise, the miner would still be making money on their Bitcoin they mined but would lose a little bit on the trade because they would have to buy a coin for the spot market rate and sell it to the other party for only $14,000.  If the price falls to $13,000 or whatever number, the miner would be losing money on their coins but able to re-coup some of their losses with the trade.  Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

Got a question regarding allocating funds in my IRA.  I changed jobs a while back and am in the process of transferring my old 401K, roughly 30K, into a Charles Schwab IRA.  One I've been looking at is GBTC Bitcoin Investment Trust.  Anyone have any opinions on them?  Also I've heard a lot of investment guys saying get between 1-3% into bitcoin but I'm thinking of maybe doing 15%.  I'm young (ish) and can handle some riskier bets.  Foolish?

Don't just look into what companies will be powering or enabling blockchain tech, also look into the ones implementing them into already established industries.  I don't have any examples but the first movers who adopt this tech will have a competitive advantage and some could see a huge spike.

Try LibertyX.com.  I used them for my first purchase and all you have to do is download their app, have a wallet and give the person at the store cash.  Be ready for high fee's, I paid 7% but each store that offers this chooses their own fee I believe.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:42:46
Exactly - Probably just the greed in me thinking I can reap some of the same rewards as the earlies and worried about when I've waited until it's too late - Corrections are fine I'm all about holding through those, just worried about an end all situation where everyone that is in my shoes might be screwed out of everything IF the exchanges fail and we watch this catastrophic rise slip to zero.  I love the enthusiasm in this sub but will take your advise to heart and will probably cash out my original investment at some point and then it won't really matter.  Having a good time on this ride in the meantime.

I'm going to take a stab at this one but I'm still newer so if I'm incorrect please point it out.  
Bitcoin mining in a nutshell is using your computing power to repeatedly do calculations and thereby you verify, along with thousands of others, the transactions taking place as well as the blocks which contain a record of every single bitcoin transaction that's ever come before it.  Miners are then rewarded with a tiny portion of fee's associated with the transfers.  The computer power it takes to mine each block doubles every so often (you'll have to look that up).  You used to be able to mine with a personal computer, however now it takes expensive rigs and even still you need to weigh energy costs to see if it can be worth it.

Damn you new Macbook.  New Nano S, new Coinbase account with some coin, relatively new Mycelium app with another sliver of coin, and no way of connecting the device to my computer due to Apple only offering one port on their computers and I don't have a "dongle" to connect them...
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:23:31
explain a little further because I'm trying to get about 200usd to my nano s and the fee was 16

I'm not an expert in bitcoin or investing by any means but I would say that an aggressive entry would be buying in with all the money you would like to invest all at once, where a patient entry might be buying in increments and possibly taking a slight advantage if the price dips in between your purchases.  Just my thought though and again I'm a complete novice I just purchased my first chunk.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:11:21
I should say that I cannot use GDAX for being a resident of Minnesota, although Coinbase works fine.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:02:03
There's been quite a few posts about this.  Personally I've read everything from it will cause much greater volatility at first then stabilize to the big money is going to pump the price up by buying only to short the hell out of it and either buy the dips or get out.  It's all speculation.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:06:30
awesome thanks, I also found a sheet of paper that said they are no longer doing that tape and instead installed a chip that monitors the integrity each time it powers on.

Thanks for the advise, I already have a small sliver of coin and plan to increase that in the coming weeks/months, however I don't have a lot of liquid cash available.  I'll see what else might become available.

Jesus man it's not the end of the world, even if they are gone.  Suicide?  Are you looking for attention?  Take a step back, a deep breath, and start calling them and trying to get verified.  You have no idea they are gone until you get verified.

You know you have to pay an absurd % if you cash that out right?  You'd be starting at 25-30% in the hole or whatever the fee is to the government.  You are young yes and have plenty of years to make this up, however starting from age X and age Y (2 years later) takes a lot away from the compound interest you would get on whatever amount you already have.  Tempting, I know, but there's not a single financial advisor on the planet that would recommend this. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:41:22
You can check out LibertyX.com.  Just be prepared to pay some big fee's.  I really wanted to get in around 10K and did but paid 7% fee which hurt but I had my small sliver of coin in 10 minutes.

Oh yeah man it makes you think all right.  I've pondered the thought of taking out a loan too, I just don't have a lot of disposable cash around, but my rational side wins every time.  Nobody knows if something, anything, could happen that would drop the confidence in Bitcoin to zero and the prices go with it.  There's a conspiracy theory out there that when a super computer  that can brute force crack the encryption gets in the wrong hands everyone's bitcoins are gone.  Or that big institutions are pumping the price up that we see now are only going to sell their coins right before futures start trading a short the hell out of it.  Do I believe these things, no, but you get what I'm saying.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:51:52

Apparently GDAX cannot be used in Minnesota and a couple other states but Coinbase does and I just bought some with Coinbase.  Shame I can't transfer to GDAX.  Confusing as they are the same entity more or less.

Hey guys this is off topic but my post was removed for talking about price even though it has nothing to do with price.  I want to buy but wont have my Ledger Nano for 2 days.  Is it fine to keep around 500 dollars worth in a mobile wallet for 2 days?  Thanks
