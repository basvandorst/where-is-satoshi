Giving someone your bank account information doesn't give them access to your account to take your money lmao.
If you're serious about these questions i dont think you're ready to invest mate, do some research first.....a lot of research

Unless its a fairly small amount and you'd rather take the small risk than pay fees for transfers

What are transaction costs like these days?
I purchased $1000 worth of BTC in November last year on Localbitcoins and I decided to leave the btc in my account on the exchange. I know this is extremely ill advised but I decided at the time that since transaction costs were so high and it's such a small amount of btc that transferring it out to a personal wallet and then back to the exchange when it was time to sell would eat up too much of the gains (losses).
Anyway, I believe transaction costs are lower these days if I'm not mistaken, I have an electrum wallet set up, how much would i expect to pay these days to transfer 0.064 btc from the exchange to my own wallet for safekeeping? Am I correct in thinking that costs have gone down? Is it worth transferring? Cheers in advance.

buy some now, buy more at the next dip. Otherwise you'll find yourself waiting forever
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:38:34
Use Coindesk's chart, its a summary of many exchanges, more accurate then just using one exchange's chart, like coinbase.

That makes no sense at all. The value of btc is whatever people are willing to buy it for
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:11:08
Erm, no. Using a credit card to pay for my groceries takes about 5 seconds and there is no transaction fee, using bitcoin it would take about 30 minutes and there would be a fee...
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:59:40
this is a phenomenal reply, i salute you
@_date: 2018-11-17 22:39:18
Mmmm fair point
@_date: 2018-11-25 12:55:00
Who's to say that 2017 was the skyrocket.  After it hit $1100 as the ATH in November 2013 it crashed to $193 13 months later. You could have said the exact same thing then, that I should bought before the 2013 skyrocket not after the 2014 crash and been entirely wrong. In 5 years this may just a be another tiny blip on the radar.
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:08:52
Why wouldn't you. Its buy low sell high not buy high sell low lol

Not really interested in your speculation aye. Go short btc if ur so sure

@_date: 2018-03-19 01:42:39
why would less people interacting with crypto online create a bearish phase? all that implys is that less volume will be traded, doesnt mean anything about whether more people will be selling as opposed to buying.

Can someone explain the basics of what an Bitcoin ATM is? Cheers
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:20:36
And I'm say that that's a stupid thing to say 
@_date: 2018-12-17 23:43:47
Literally no one knows, everyone who is replying thinking that they actually know is an idiot
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:42:19
Ahh I see, thanks. 
ATM doesnt really seem like the appropriate name then, it's more like a bitcoin store than a bitcoin atm
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:46:55
This wasnt a serious comment lol. Cheers for the effort tho
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:18:53
Anyone who tries to make a prediction like this is an idiot. Theres no possible way of knowing, you're literally just guessing 
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:33:59
I dont understand. A cash ATM is for withdrawing money physically that you already possess electronically. But there is no physical form of bitcoin? So it cant be for withdrawing bitcoin (right?). Is it for purchasing bitcoin or something?
@_date: 2018-12-07 10:13:24
Guys I bought the dip and now it's still dipping what do I do now
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:46:58
Bitcoin vending machine is a much better name haha. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:32:32
It's just stupid, it's not based on anything, you're just picking a random number 
@_date: 2018-12-07 10:23:26
But what if it dips again
