Its a new secular religion for people in modern times. 
It is dogmatic and spends a lot of time making ethical judgments of others. Vegans prey on their own and pride themselves on how much more truly vegan they are compared to other vegans.
It is more about replacing religion and giving people purpose and a sense of self worth than it is about being healthy or animal welfare. If you speak with a vegan they never seem to accept any research that goes against their ideas and yet they accept the flimsiest of research that supports them.  In the end it's very cultish how it becomes their actual identity and they are defending their self worth and self image. 
It is a label and a social hierarchy that I would not want to be involved in. It is a belief system and I don't feel the desire or need to follow any system like that. 
I think it's a fun experiment if you are young like a teenager, but as you get older its better to drop these things and just forge your own path. It's kind of silly to be "a vegan" just be a person. 
I think it's a bit poisonous to create these groups that just divide us in the end. And trying to merge ethics and moral superiority with trendy diets seems disingenuous.

By being a vegan and calling yourself "a vegan" you are taking on a dogmatic system of values and ideas. You are giving up your individual choices and ideas in some ways and taking on the group think. This means that it is totally fair for me to generalize vegans because they all live by a similar code and shared belief system. If you call yourself vegan you have already put yourself into a general category.
