I used to be a pretty hardcore gamer, my friend advised me i should mine some Bitcoin and make 5$ a week while i wasn't using my PC. But i was selling Virtual Currencies and had no interest in making 5$ a week. I never really researched into it as i was still fairly young, and didn't see the potential.
At the time 1 Bitcoin was 15 cent. Two and a half / three years later i stumbled upon it again, and i watched it go from 400$-&gt;1100$ within the space of like a month.

I believe there's implementations in the pipeline to make the GETADDR computationally expensive, to prevent users from gathering all the active nodes and listening to where transactions get broadcasted from, removing the anonymity of Bitcoin.
But, even if you did have a huge list of Bitcoin addresses, you still have the problem of finding a way to exploit it.
There's been attacks like this in the past where someone managed to create a shedton of Bitcoins, the network simply agreed to rollback and fork off into a new chain after resolving the problem.
Regarding the 51% attack, China very well could invest hundreds of millions into mining hardwell to try control 51% of the mining, but it would not be economical what so ever and an attack like this would only ever be done so in a malicious manor. If it ever got to that stage, other countries could counter by simply setting up more miners. But more realistically, mining pools are more likely going to control 51% of the miners than China.

I Agree, the whole idea of btc is the fact that it's moving away from money being centralised. But this will limit it and will still make it fully controllable by the government, even if they don't directly own it.
Imagine this, in the future, if it ever took off it would similar to that of how the internet is now. There are larger nodes (e.g ISPs) which are considered to be on the "Main Network" which can almost act as btc banks, where the none technical can put / invest there money and it is held securly.
But the problem is, look what's happening to ISP's now, especially in the UK, the internet is open and free but blockades are being places on ISPs, i think the exact same would happen with btc. Blockades would be places to check the history of the coin and if it's not a "clean coin" then it won't be accepted on the "Main Network" and before you know it, companies like amazon, ebay etc won't accept unclean money. Yeah there are probably still places you could possibily spend it but these will be smaller networks of people and most definitely not the main network of people. If you see where i'm coming from.

Tin Foil hats aside, what are the theories on how the FBI ( or NSA ) have discovered this?
- Is there some form of weakness in TOR's hidden services?
- Do they figured out a way to crack well known encyption methods ( Unlikely )?
- If the NSA did have enough Relay, Bridge and Exit nodes, is it possibile, at all, for them to discover the location of the hidden service? or be able to decrypt / view traffic passing through specific nodes?

Your comparison doesn't even make sense. You've obviously misunderstood my point. We're talking about people purchasing Bitcoin in "Bits", not people not accepting cents because it's not a whole dollar.
What i'm saying is, If someone who's new to Bitcoin wants to purchase say 100,000 "Bits". 100,000 sounds like alot, and they might be satisfied with that. But, if they realised they were infact only purchasing 0.1 btc, they'd perhaps consider buying more as it doesn't sound that much. Again, this won't apply to everyone, and i'm not saying that it will have an effect on the price at all. I'm simply expressing one way it could have a negetive effect on the price.

Bitcoin has been "hacked" before, when millions of Bitcoins were created. It will most certainly be hacked again and each time, the network will come to a consensus about the correct course of action.

Bitcoin could go either way. If you invest now, in 10 years time it could be worth a hell of a lot of money or it could be worth nothing.
Bitcoin has the potential to disrupt the status quo and cause a paradigm shift, if that's the case, 400$ a bitcoin will be peanuts on what it could potentially be worth.
What convinced me to invest my money is is the risk reward ratio. There's potentially 50% chance it won't be around in 10 years time but if it is, there's a chance you could get a 1000% - 3000% ROA. It's like putting your money on red, and getting a 36:1 payout.

I think you're very naive to think that the Bitcoin price is "more mature", it dropped 20% in a single day the other week and you're saying it's in for a "slow and steady rise"? 
Bitcoin hasn't sparked any interest from any major financial investors or institutions whatsoever, yes it's got people "talking" and researching into the technology, but as of any major financial investment, it's simply too risky and volatile.
Now, i'm not saying that any major financial whales will invest, that's not my argument. My argument is you don't seem to understand the concept of a bubble, perhaps 150 billion made my last comment come across absurd, i was simply trying to emphasis my point. Which is, even a sudden investment of 20 million could shift the price massively. Not because it's a large amount of money, but it can trigger a knock on effect of people holding due to fear of missing out, reducing supply, causing the price rises more, people buy more as again, they have a fear of missing out, media jump on board hype it even more, more people buy, more people hold reducing supply even further etc.. until it grinds to a halt and crashes.. and the thing is, it's even easier to buy Bitcoin now as opposed to the last bubble.
I think even the thought Bitcoin being in for a "slow and steady ride" is border line retarded, i'm almost starting to believe you're a massive troll. Either that or you're just childishly thick.
@_date: 2016-01-28 11:21:15
Perhaps 150 billion came across as quite absurd, as you seem to think 150 billion is a huge amount of money in the financial world. My point still stands either way, even 20-30 million could potentially shift the price massively.

"Except of course, it doesn’t work, unless you have massive amounts of funding or a **brilliant idea that can completely disrupt the existing the market.** Even then, you probably still need a fair amount of luck."
Well for a start, Bitcoin i believe is a brilliant idea that can potentially completely disrupt the market. But even if it wasn't, you're still missing my point (which to be fair, wasn't the clearest). 
dellintelcrypto suggested that it would be a slow and steady climb, as Bitcoin seems to have "matured". I was implying that the market cap is absolutely tiny to suggest this and even if a very small (in comparison to global markets) realistic amount which could potentially be invested from either wealthy individuals,  hedge funds or an organisation were to be invested, it could potentially shift the price massively. Especially since Bitcoin is not regulated and reacts strongly to price movement.
Just to clarify also, you seem to have forgotten that this is a hypothetical situation. dellintelcrypto was speculating what he thinks would happen if the price was to rise to 10,000$. And i offered a hypothetical counter-argument opposed to why i don't think he can say with certainty that it will rise "slow and steady". So there's no use throwing the 1% fallacy around, when the price may not ever reach 10,000$ and very little interest could be shown from investors.

Correct me if i'm wrong, but i can't see a reason increasing the blocksize, as i don't think it's the correct way to scale Bitcoin. Even if we did increase the block size to 1GB, that's still only 7,000 transactions per second. Visa at it's peak does ~~50,000+~~24,000. If an "Internet of things" ever become a reality, ~~50,000~~ 24,000 transactions per second would be nothing.
I personally think Satoshi didn't envision it for it to become a system of mcropayments, but added it to prevent DDOS protection. I think a much bigger fundamental change is required to scale Bitcoin, as opposed to just increasing the blocksize.
That's just my two cent.

Bitcoin is pseudonymous, but doesn't give you perfect anonymity. The majority of the time you're safe. It's when exchanging the money to cash you risk becoming identified. 
There was an issue where a peer could query nodes for it's peer nodes, and query them nodes recursively to discover everyone on the network. Then it can listen where an original transaction proper-gated from to discover the IP.
I'm not sure if this is still possible but if it is, it's expensive to do ( few thousand $ ) and i doubt they'd do it for a small time drug dealer selling weed. If you're still worried, you can also still use TOR to connect to the Bitcoin network and remain anonymous.
So yeah, your identity is fairly safe as long as you're smart with it and don't piss of the NSA :-)

ELI5: Imagine you had 3 people mining, what they're essentially doing is fighting to submit their version of the block chain.
Now imagine each person mining is guessing the "passcode", which if correct, will allow their version of the ledger to be submitted to the network without question. 
Now lets say the passcode set by the network is a maximum of 3 digits long, meaning there's 1000 different combinations, and each person can guess 333 combinations a minute. That means on average, someone will find the pass code every one minute if there's just 3 people on the network.
Now lets say another 30 people join the network. If it stayed at the current difficulty (a pass code 4 digits long) it would mean that you have 10x the guessing power so you'd guess the pass code 10x quicker, which would mean a block is submitted every 6~ seconds, which is too quick. It needs to be submitted every one minute, else you're potentially risking more complications. So what the network does, is agree that the pass code is now 5 digits long, meaning there's 10,000 different combinations which will average 1 block being found every minute with 33 people.
As more people join the network, the software is working out on average how quickly blocks are being submitted. If they're being submitted too quickly, the software agree to increase the size of the pass code. If they're being submitted too slowly, the network reduces the size of the pass code.

The internet was invented in the 60's but it didn't gain mainstream adoption until the very early 90's, when Tim Berners-Lee invented the HTTP protocol.
Now i'm not saying Bitcoin will follow the same trend, because you just don't know. But Bitcoin ( in my opinion ) is still in it's very early stages, most people sadly don't understand anything about it or how it works, and are scared to use it. Even in 50 years time, if not much has changed then i still don't think it will catch on. However, if someone comes along like Tim Berners-Lee, with a ground breaking idea that can make Bitcoin far easier and useful for the general Public, that's when Bitcoin will take off.

I think it's very realistic considering the potential of Bitcoin. The last bubble peaked around 1100$ and that was two years ago. Since then Bitcoin has grown in popularity and it's become much easier for people to get money in and out of Bitcoin, so 2000$ could be very realistic.
It's like anything, Bitcoin could crash and burn. But how i see it is, you're putting your money on red but getting a 36:1 payout.

"How hard can it be to get one measly percent of a market? Ka-ching! Except of course, it doesn’t work, unless you have massive amounts of funding or a brilliant idea that can completely disrupt the existing the market. Even then, you probably still need a fair amount of luck."
I think Bitcoin is potentially a brilliant idea that can completely disrupt the existing market. No?

I think Reddit were kind of hoping he was a either A: An Alien or B: Some socially awkward dude who decided he's going to change the world. Not some self righteous asshole.

This is what throws me off. If you didn't want to be identified, you wouldn't be saying things like "i got bitcoins when they didn't have a value". You wouldn't put yourself in the spotlight either.
Satoshi obviously didn't want to be identified and went to great lengths to hide his identity. He would not make such obvious mistakes, which CW has.
This to me sounds like a man who for whatever reason, wants to be identified as Satoshi Nakamoto, and is dropping subtle hints that suggest he is, hoping for the world to clock on and start accusing him of being Satoshi. There's no way this man is Satoshi Nakamoto, perhaps he was involved, but i'd bet my money he isn't Satoshi himself.

Its not profitable mining bitcoin anymore. Youllvmake more money mining alt coins and trading them for btx on cryptsy. With 1.5megahash im making 1btc a month. That cost me 700 pound to setup. With 20k dollars you could set up a rig with about 50 megahash, which is 40btc a month. Excluding electricity.

True. But, this is not a share of a company and although it has similarities, it could and most likely will act completely different since it is not as understood and is more volatile than the stock market. But you're right, no one knows where it's going but looking at the history of the coin, its never collapsed and has always stabilised itself until the next bubble so my money is on the fact that its going to be around for a long time unless something catastrophic happens.

The fact this coin has been up to 1200$ a coin will always stop it from dropping to 0, because people will invest while it's cheap again in hope it returns back up to 1200.

Under normal circumstances I'd say I told you so. But, as I have told so with such vehemence and frequency already the phrase has lost all meaning. Therefore, I will be replacing it with the phrase, I have informed you thusly.
There, I said it!

It's been a conspiracy for years that the US Gov want a global currency, would it make sense that currency being BTC though? Considering it's decentralized.

I agree with bitcoin being inevitable, but the idea behind paying machines not so much. If this scenario ever became true which I doubt, the machine must firstly be able to understand and think, to be able to want bitcoin. and if they could understand and think, they'd want what ever values them  the most such as usd. I think by thinking it's a virtual currency they could have access to it easily, buy they'd have access to online banking and things would be in place to allow them to have access to it;
