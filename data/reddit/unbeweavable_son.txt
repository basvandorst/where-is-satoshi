I waited a week, it usually takes about 5 days. This was 28 hours after the 5 days of pending when they put a time and date it would happen. Except with what's going on lately it took them a bit longer
@_date: 2013-03-23 05:17:01
Well they did come through for me just took a while!

@_date: 2013-04-28 06:05:07
Any word on res for mobile users?
@_date: 2013-03-15 22:23:16
Buy one or two to get your feet wet, this community is outstanding in helping you out and you won't be in that deep, if you have any questions a great resource is , someone should tip OP to get him started! I would but i need to transfer it and I'm at work sorry
@_date: 2013-03-15 03:06:49
Down vote the hell out of this guy
@_date: 2013-03-22 19:24:32

Sorry there you go, just paying it forward, thanks to @_date: 2013-03-23 01:22:26
I'm confused what your question is, was all that you had .69btc? If so did you include the mining fee, if not it may eventually be picked up by a miner but will take forever
@_date: 2013-03-14 23:26:33
What is this tip thing?
@_date: 2013-03-15 00:25:40
Ok so i bought my first btc!!!! I still don't get the tip thing i think i messed that up....thank you guys so much for the insight......
@_date: 2013-03-14 23:30:20
So its basically like tipping you for good advice and such based off of acceptable etiquette? Ok think I'm starting to get it
@_date: 2013-03-22 22:30:59
How do they fake that
@_date: 2013-03-23 01:24:41
The min bet is .010 and the fee will be .005 so minimum will be .015 
@_date: 2013-03-22 20:28:45
Congrats on the job!
+tip $0.10 USD verify
@_date: 2013-03-23 20:35:16
That's cause the minimum bet is .010 you have to at least send that much at least actually .015
@_date: 2013-03-23 04:29:14
Lol meant got in the car
@_date: 2013-03-21 01:25:17
That's good news
@_date: 2013-03-21 00:35:37
Lol mine is the same way, I'm sure she is sick of my constant updates! She likes to Reddit along side of me, but when its on this sub she is like awww man this again
@_date: 2013-03-22 01:13:54
As of now the Coinbase site is down....
Edit: a word, even still they may be sightless as well
@_date: 2013-03-15 00:57:12
Also how do i use these addresses, like for satoshi dice or to trade buy from others....few more questions up there in the thread if you could glance and maybe answer
@_date: 2013-03-22 01:40:36
Lol oh crap didn't see my phone correction!
@_date: 2013-03-22 04:52:35
Ill keep everyone updated
@_date: 2013-03-15 00:29:04
Done, now i just need to understand how to accept monies and tips better
@_date: 2013-03-22 19:23:57
Lol satoshi dice is the devil!
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:09:05
Ya that's about the only way right now, problem is price is dipping so when you go to pay it is it market price or the price you printed the payment slip at?
@_date: 2013-03-15 02:35:38
That is the quickest way to getting hacked
Fucking spam scammer....seems legit lol. Hate that crap
@_date: 2013-03-23 20:37:57
Your welcome!
@_date: 2013-04-19 04:20:11
Absolutely love this site. Been using for a while! Great support for all coins... Much needed for cryptos. Excellent odds.... Its like being in a casino. Personally wouldn't use any other, support chat and fun people to play with! Shoutout hyperweb, and guy_sans terracoin and others! Keep up the great work!
@_date: 2013-03-15 03:24:38
And im ok with that
@_date: 2013-03-22 00:52:21
Your right. I haven't used dwolla, let me know how that works... I think I'm going to try bitfloor next. Been hearing good things. I really hope coinbase gets there crap together, it is very frustrating
@_date: 2013-03-22 00:10:27
Haha you gotta know when to hold em, know when to try to fold them but still pending for a few weeks... 
@_date: 2013-03-22 00:48:20
That was very nice of you, this is why i love the bitcoin community
@_date: 2013-03-15 03:35:33


Unfortunately i got my first BTC today after way too much lurking, i was extremely surprised at how fast and helpful the community was and to me that is a great sign of where this is headed
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:20:16
[This will help]( 
@_date: 2013-03-14 23:07:31
Is buying the coin essentially investing in the stock?
@_date: 2013-03-15 03:38:14
Thank you so much, i would feel stupid tipping you back what you gave me so i have you a shout out on a different thread...really thanks
@_date: 2013-03-22 00:07:24

@_date: 2013-03-21 03:33:06
Let me check mine
@_date: 2013-03-15 00:01:48
Ok so i have a wallet now what?
@_date: 2013-03-14 23:28:49
Ok so i have about 100$ to spend. I should get a wallet. What's a reasonable amount to keep in there and, should i have multiple wallets? I'm essentially waiting for the currency to rise? If i choose to sell is there exchanges that give me current rates for us dollar? Also what is this bittip thing here in the thread. Please please excuse my ignorance I'm so interested but such a noob
@_date: 2013-03-23 01:16:29
Just finished a bitinstant and omg it was painless. Had my coins before i hit the car
@_date: 2013-03-15 00:45:41
You guys have been amazing. One question. Should i become more involved with the mtgox apps
@_date: 2013-03-23 05:58:57
Ya took about two days to get mine into another wallet
@_date: 2013-03-21 01:20:58
God i hope so mine for 6 pm haven't yet
@_date: 2013-03-14 23:43:37
Ah i see ok I'm going to set it up in the hour ill commentt back, did i reject it though. Lol sorry if I'm bugging you guys
@_date: 2013-04-28 05:53:49
I came here just to say this and only this, please don't feel the need to upvote or tip. But.....but. Cowboy_coder deserves a great thank you as he has been a magnificent pioneer in bitcoin. When i first got into it a while ago, he tipped me my first amount and literally walked me through every step. If you look at his history he has helped many people get into cryptocurrency and has tipped so many people. Brother i salute you. It is and always will be people like this that make this sub and the currency itself An AMAZING alternative. For those who don't know, its people like this person right here who are unsung heroes in making this work. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. I would tip you all i had my friend, in fact i was lucky enough to get my girlfriend a trip to cabo in a month strictly off bitcoin. All because of you. If your like this person i salute you to. Take notice everyone. This is was makes this community great. Money is money. I wanted to give you something better. My sincere word as a man. I respect you. Thanks for all you do..... ....thank you.
@_date: 2013-03-22 04:02:06
Lol good luck with coinbase
@_date: 2013-03-22 02:36:32
True, how bullish can you be without access to more lol! I think best option right now is locally person to person.
@_date: 2013-03-21 22:27:34
Thanks ill try there too
@_date: 2013-04-28 06:39:35
What's your estimated cost of initial development. Base numbers for implementation.
