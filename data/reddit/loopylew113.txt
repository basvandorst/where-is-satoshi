TL;DR, but I can already tell you've got a very wise way of thinking

*If* you're incompetent with storing BTC.
Although it does kiiiinda suck that you have to take aloooot of measures to secure it 100% properly, cold storage/encryption, maybe Multi-sig if you have somebody you trust a ton, or just have two devices linked up ��

Hahaha, maybe so!

With SegShit2x being done and over with, bitcoin can now resume it's traditional path, to greater value and wider audiences. I've stuck with bitcoin since i discovered it, i hope you do too :P

Not available? It's available 24/7, are you looking at the right wallet? And you choose the fees with electrum, go extremely low fees or high and fast fees. Electrum doesn't choose for you unless you let it. And so far, I've encountered 0 issues, it's fast and lightweight as hell.

Yup, it's promising. I just hope no fraud attempts damage it to a catastrophic extent, I genuinely do not know what to expect with 2x coming up. But I do know I'm going to exchange to fiat beforehand, and try to buy low.

Temporarily, I think bitcoins price would fly past the moon at 4x lightspeed, fly around the Andromeda galaxy, back around to earth, and slowly drop down to a more stable price.

It's entirely true, a 3rd party owns the private key to your funds, if you don't have that key. You're not the owner of those funds. *Yes* you can withdraw, but until you withdraw to a wallet which you have 100% control over, in bitcoin terms, it's not yours, if coinbase goes bust, bye bye bitcoins!

Good luck :P

I don't suggest using coinbase. My main new reason is because of them supporting 2x, but that's a whole other debate. Mainly, they have very high sending fees. You can send bitcoin for twice as cheap, at the same speed as them. Using the Electrum wallet, older bitcoins users will already understand this, but not the new ones. Don't pay more fees than you have to!

How about 14 satoshi?
