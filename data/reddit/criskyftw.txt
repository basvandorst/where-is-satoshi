How exactly does this work? Once you set up a coin, what? How do you set up a miner and an exchange for it?
@_date: 2014-09-12 19:31:39
I'm not sure that you understand the point of those security points. It's not to protect private photos. It's to protect banking/credit card and other important data.
@_date: 2014-09-12 21:16:36
Right. But people communicate with Mastercard using hotmail, so neither can hotmail.
@_date: 2014-10-31 21:25:15
Idk if it's the bitcoin thing...
@_date: 2014-06-19 02:27:18
OK interesting. Thanks.
@_date: 2012-05-28 20:38:17
i refuse to use credit cards (except for a $5 or less purchase that i make once a month to keep my credit score amazing) for this very reason.
@_date: 2012-08-06 19:54:23
guns just don't sell as well as drugs *shrugs*
@_date: 2012-05-28 14:43:12
tried that... no one wants to do paypal or bank transfer. i guess i try again later.
then again i didn't have a PGP key...
@_date: 2012-05-28 14:44:00
fair enough. i'm in the USA, NY to be specific.
and yeah. i don't mind small fees, but when a percentage here and there realllllly adds up.
@_date: 2012-05-28 17:21:28
alrighty. fair enough. :)
@_date: 2012-05-29 21:45:56
alrighty. thanks
@_date: 2012-08-07 03:02:36
agreed :)
@_date: 2012-05-28 16:50:14
thanks for the link to bitfloor. major help. i use the same bank as them already XD will be doing a cash deposit for bitcoins tomorrow.
have you used them before? just want to make sure they're reliable.
@_date: 2012-05-29 13:51:39
false, sir. i was on just fine without one.
@_date: 2012-05-29 21:39:53
ok. how long did it take you to receive funds? i did a deposit and email today. when can i expect it to show up on my account?
@_date: 2015-02-12 12:22:39
You need banks to sell bit coin usually, many mmj dispensaries have trouble with banks because weed is involved.
@_date: 2013-06-03 21:32:43
Ah. Ok. That makes sense. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-06-04 11:12:22
I provided blockchains for the original transactions showing them going from my wallet to the wallet specified by the buyer as well.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:46:28
I had issues with verification on Dwolla. But since you suggested it, could you expand on why?
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:55:14
Maybe ask the server if they know what a bit coin is/if they use them.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:47:50
300 euros (~$390) is more than i plan on spending in one day with this account, it would be used mostly for small purchases. but i'll look into it.
@_date: 2013-06-03 21:20:24
Very good point.
Now, quick question. How can I set up bank transfer payments on paypal? There doesn't seem to be a way on my account.
@_date: 2013-06-04 10:23:36
This could work... good idea thanks.
@_date: 2013-02-25 21:03:47
*shrugs* i usually just have them run in the background while i do whatever else i'm doing.
@_date: 2013-07-03 04:33:17
Why would i send bitcoins to my computer wallet when i am trying to convert USD to BTC?
@_date: 2013-07-19 20:33:26
Not if you use TOR and/or a VPN. At that point it honestly just becomes to much of a hassle for them to actually spend the time/money finding out that it's you doing the whatever you are doing.
Also, public access wifi hotspots are also awesome for anonymity and mobile hotspots can offer plausible deniability.
@_date: 2013-04-20 21:18:52
Ok... see the thing is though that my situation is almost completely different. I would never be wiring money anywhere but from a trad service to OKPay then spending it via OKPay services. I would also never have more than $200 on the account.
I understand that shady is as shady does, but I am failing to see how this applies to my particular situation.
@_date: 2013-07-18 15:17:34
A guy I know uses SR. Stuff is usually bagged, double vacuum sealed, then placed in a container like a DVD case or similar which is then taped or shrink wrapped shut. Then it's sent via normal USPS. Return addresses are usually faked/go to a public/official building/front business so that it looks like they ordered something online or it's part of a subscription.
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:51:51
right, i was just presenting what i thought he was referring to.
@_date: 2013-06-02 13:25:35
Instant fiat to btc and vice versa conversions would be nice.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:21:39
ok thanks for the info. I'll keep that in my back pocket as another option in the future, but for now i don't think it meets my needs right now.
@_date: 2013-07-28 19:17:56
Right. When i use the for in-person transactions i dont wait fpr any usually. I just meant the overall transaction.
@_date: 2013-07-28 12:49:26
Like 3 minutes? Then the initial 6 confirmations go for a couple hours.
Edit: added 6.
@_date: 2013-07-28 19:57:36
I know?
@_date: 2013-08-02 03:28:30
Right. That's what I figured.
@_date: 2013-07-02 21:19:13
Send what? USD?
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:58:55
yeah... i never foresee using that much money in one day... lol
@_date: 2013-07-28 18:15:43
That's exactly what I meant... isn't 6 confirmations standard?
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:59:32
@_date: 2013-06-03 21:10:03
I have a great seller feedback (200+) and yeah, that's what I've heard. If I decide to try again, I'll only accept bank transfer or try to set up credit card processing without paypal.
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:52:26
valid, that is a possibility. and if it does, awesome. we'll wait and see.
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:56:09
1: thanks
2: yeah, it theres a $3 charge to put money on the card and a small fee for using an ATM. It's better to just use it to make actual purchases.
3: that's what i figured.
4: that's not so bad.
@_date: 2013-07-28 19:51:45
Right. When i use the for in-person transactions i dont wait fpr any usually. I just meant the overall transaction.
@_date: 2013-07-28 16:25:07
Yes? I use it almost daily. The 3 minutes includ the time it takes to scan the QR code and type in all the stuff.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:56:22
that's basically what i'm doing with some "fun money". 
i have my investment wallet, which i don't touch and just watch go up, but i also have my "day trading" account on MtGox, where basically i put $40 in when coins were that cheap, bought 1 coin, set it to sell at a certain price (at $70 in this case) then i rinse repeat, buying $40 worth of BTC, then selling when the price of BTC reaches an agreeable amount, the buying in with $40 again. it's relatively slow going, but at this point i've made over $40 profit with this method and, based on trends in the market and what not i may add a bit more weight to these transactions.
I plan on continuing to do this buy-sell-rinse-repeat method until the price begins to fall (i predict around june/july) then i'll cash out this account and wait until next december/january when i'll start over with whatever the price of 1 BTC is.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:10:42
right. ok. i gleaned that much from their website. the thing is, i'd like to keep my BTC earnings separate from other money that I have (budgeting and what not). how common is it that i run into a store that accepts Dwolla payments? do major chains accept them? how will i be able to tell who does and who doesn't?
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:16:44
not selling, but a computer's video card can run certain algorithms to generate coin.
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:50:58
yup :)
@_date: 2013-08-02 02:51:31
Ok. So energy isn't that important anyway. But could I afford a decent ASIC?
@_date: 2013-06-25 19:20:19
Yeah. So you want to get your parents to help you buy drugs then have those drugs shipped to your parent's house so that if any law enforcement  gets involved your parents go to jail?
No. I have no problem with people choosing to do drugs. Whatever. I do, however have a problem with kids doing drugs and a problem with people doing drugs in a way that could potential fuck up other people's lives.
Just go to a dealer like the rest of us did in highschool.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:48:02
based in the past couple years, the price should begin to go slowly starting in sometime around june until about November/december, when they will begin to increase again.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:00:40
depends on trading service. some are actually a lot lower.
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:50:39
i track the current price of BTC on a widget my phone, and when it reaches my cutoff point i check my MtGox account. then set up for the next step. it takes about 5 seconds every time i look at my phone and about 10 minutes or so ever couple days.
recently, it's brought in about $15 every couple days, so it's not much but that's because of how small the amount of money i'm playing with is. as you use more money, the reward increases as well. at this point, made a profit of more than $40, so worst case scenario and BTC completely goes to $0, i've still made some money.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:30:08
No problem.
@_date: 2013-07-18 15:24:10
The thing is, in restaurants that I've worked in, name tags and badges were not a thing, and were actually not allowed at all.
@_date: 2013-06-18 21:10:05
thanks for the resource! i'll start using it.
