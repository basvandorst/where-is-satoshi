Fees are definitely too high. I am a noob, but I have a little BTC, and I decided to give some to my niece for a graduation gift. I printed out a paper wallet, sent over $20. Two hours later, only 2 confirmations, and a $5 fee. That's absurd! 25% ????!

Definitely do it. I securely printed out a paper wallet and added ~$20 as a graduation gift for my niece. Sadly, it got misplaced and never mailed out.
In just the short 2 months since I printed the wallet, that $20 is likely closer to $30 now. Hopefully that helps make it better when she finally gets it :)
The price will go much, much higher. Maybe it will crash here and there, but it's going up exponentially.

I used  and I went ahead and ordered the tamper proof stickers he sells. I downloaded the wallet generator using the instructions on that site.
Make sure you use a safe computer that is 100% free of viruses and malware. Then disconnect from the internet and generate a wallet using the downloaded generator. Then print manually (not wifi printing). Once that's done, you can note down the public address, seal the paper wallet up, and then send the funds to the public address. Good luck!

Could it not be a similar symbol? Is that still breaking trademark?

Thank you for that... I think I understand now. Cheers

Not that I'm aware of. It seems that coinbase charges a minimum of $1.99, which is ok if you're buying $50 But not if you're buying $10. Plus they mark up the cost. That's why I'm doing $50/week
@_date: 2017-09-05 15:11:50
Yeah but I don't always buy cigs everyday. I spend about $50/week or less on smokes
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:05:05
I'll third it. $50/week in BTC to avoid high fees for $10 purchases at a time. No cigs.
