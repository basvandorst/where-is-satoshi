I've been off this forum for a month. Why is the price stable at $11k? It's been like this nearly 2 weeks. Is there any reason or is this random?
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:58:04
CME Futures.

I've not been charged any fees transferring between coinbase and electrum, so I'm guessing the same applies between coinbase/gdax and other wallets. I'm not too sure though.
You can try sending over a small amount to test it out.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:42:38
Because I was watching gdax live when the price went from 12k to  9k. It dropped by 3k within 5 minutes. If it dropped that much over several hours (and I wasn't watching it live) I wouldn't have panicked so much.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:10:34
Ok, I think it might be because there's a lot of activity on gdax right now. The price is swinging £100-200 every minute.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:49:10
It might take a few hours.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:10:08
There needs to be another dip to 10k euros. I sold everything at that price :( 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:21:57
Can you post a screenshot of your model?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:02:26
How come it's going up so fast right now? Every minute I refresh my Coinbase app, my portfolio is worth a few more pounds.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:00:48
The Coinbase fees are outrageous. You can use Gdax or Gemini if you want lower fees.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:44:23
I completely agree. The only good news is that we're now closer to implementing the lightning network which will help with the main issues concerning bitcoin (high transaction fees and instant payments).
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:38:57
Lmao, there are bots on this forum disliking every comment.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:39:36
Yes you can deposit and withdraw crypto from and to gdax/coinbase.
Log into Coinbase, click "Accounts" then click "BTC wallet" then click on either "Send" or "Receive" to send or receive BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:10:57
You can store coins on gdax/gemini (but I wouldn't recommend that).
If you store it elsewhere, then yes you need to transfer the coins to gdax/gemini before you can sell.
Gdax is owned by coinbase and transferring between the two is fast and free. There is also no fee for buying/selling on gdax if you use limit orders. I highly recommend gdax.

What are seeds and private keys? Is that applicable to hardware wallets only?
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:44:09
I'm hoping that a dip even happens. It looks like it's going down now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:29:57
I sent some bitcoins from one wallet to another (first time I've ever done this) and the coins still haven't arrived at my new wallet. I sent it over an hour ago. Is this normal?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:11:29
I just saw, one of my pending orders went through.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:21:00
I take the bet. I'll give you 0.5 bitcoins if the price on Monday is higher than it is now ($15.7k). You give me 0.5 bitcoins if the price is lower than $15.7k. Deal?
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:37:44
That is so cute! It reminds me of something my Mum would do lol.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:22:46
Coinbase is good for beginners.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:50:26
What do you guys think will happen tomorrow? Is the price likely to fall? I'm holding off on buying until the price is more stable.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:18:14
It's normal. I sent some bitcoins from one wallet to another yesterday and it took a couple of hours for the transaction to be confirmed.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:27:04
No, it was a simple process for me. Contact Coinbase support if after the 24 hour ban the verification still fails.
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:21:07
Lol can't charge interest or buy lottery tickets because you can't enjoy money you don't earn but you can own bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:46:34
It just dropped £2000 in ONE MINUTE (on Gdax).
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:25:18
Why is bitcoin price still dropping? I thought it's more profitable to mine BTC now?
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:00:01
The price was going up and down by £100 yesterday (so stayed relatively stable). I chose to sell at £5155 so I can buy back at £5100, but now it's at £5,300 and increasing. FML.
To make it worse, I made a loss when I sold.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:43:29
I understand what you mean but bitcoin isn't tied to a physical commodity so you can't compare the two.
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:38:04
I shouldn't have said most, but I am a bit biased because, being  Asian, I'm part of the "gold culture". Annually, millions of South and East Asians buy gold jewellery or decorations.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:29:10
How do you know there's going to be another "pump and dump". How do you get access to information like that?
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:49:40
The USD has practical use - you can go into ANY store (in the USA) and buy things with it. You can convert it into other currencies (the Euro) when you're in a different country.
Bitcoin isn't as widely accepted as a currency.
If in the future it does become more mainstream, won't the price stabilise? It can't keep going up forever, can it?
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:45:43
Do you think the price will stabilise if everyone starts using bitcoin? Also, don't you think that governments may invent their own cryptocurrency if there's enough demand? They'll probably make bitcoin illegal in the future because of its association with the blackmarket.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:17:12
I'm clearly an idiot lol. I was impatient and wanted a bit of profit.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:32:33
I just had a lecture on trading strategies this morning and I was actually correct. MOST people who own gold, hold it because they wear it. Central banks are the second largest group who own gold. 
You didn't need to down vote me just because you didn't agree with something that turned is indeed a fact.
