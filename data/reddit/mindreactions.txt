 Now ﻿the cryptocurrency and blockchain present very interesting options for people looking to save their money for the future with the greatest interest rates of the market. Personally I believe in a new blockchain company Akropolis, which works in the field of pensions and savings for retirement.

How Credits can be secure? It's a platform that stays under developers that can dispose of my money, I guess.

It'll better to invest in Credits instead of Bitcoin.

Only the time shows. Now is better to trade with currencies like stellar eos or credits from my point of view.

I would say it just causes confusion to the general public who have not so much knowledge of how different cryptocurrency work. A lot may think its a sub name of the original. And we see the tension between BTC &amp; BCH 
The point of a hardfork is to kill off the original chain. But there are also strange names like CREDITS, thinking thats it’s a bank loans, however it’s a blockchain company and cryptocurrency, and there are a lot of same situations, soon will confused in that.

Yeah, 12K might be real as well as 1$ for CREDITS tokens.
