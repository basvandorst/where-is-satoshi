Niice, I am excited for you and to see how high the price will go. The hardest thing now will be deciding when to actually sell. I like your backup plan btw! Florida is nice this time of year.

This will probably get buried and never be seen, but you are restoring faith in humanity. So many lives will benefit from your generosity. Thank you.
