I feel like either the majority of their customers are making transactions of thousands of dollars so they don't care, or BitPay just realized nobody notices this so why not fuck them over while the getting's good.

5 months later, That same 0.000520 BTC is now worth $6.17
Looks like they haven't changed the fee at all. Morons. Who's going to pay that?

I think you're right. I tried it again for a $50 purchase and noticed something strange. 


0.020271 BTC is the same price that my wallet was telling me. But at a different dollar amount ($51.31). I looked closer on the QR code page and found a dropdown that itemized the purchase.
Here's the whole itemization:
 |  |
Payment Amount | 0.019751 BTC
Network Cost | 1 transaction x **0.000520 BTC**
Total | 0.020271 BTC
That **0.000520 BTC** is our mysterious $1.31! 
Thanks for helping me figure this out!

I haven't had this problem before.

How would that work? What if you put a fee that was too low?
@_date: 2017-06-29 18:01:11
And I suppose the fee would not come back.
So, what if I just paid the $1.31 BitPay fee? Would I get whatever amount of that that was more than necessary or would BitPay just pocket it? Or would it all go to miners to increase its priority?

~~If that was the case, a higher priced purchase would have that same $1.32 fee with just a few added cents. I tried setting up a $24 purchase and it charged an extra $2.31. That's still about a 10% fee. That still makes no sense.~~ 
_EDIT_: No, wait. I must've read it wrong. It must have been $1.32. I just tried a $50 purchase and the extra charge was $1.30. I think you're right that it's a flat fee. The transaction fee has been floating between 1-3 cents. 
So how do I avoid this fee? My wallet is clearly WAY overestimating how much it will cost.

So if it never confirms, then that money is just gone?

So you're saying my wallet is essentially... fragmented? That doesn't seem likely. I've hardly even used it for spending. And I've only ever received money into it once.
How would I find out how fragmented it is?

1. Isn't that supposed to be like 1%? not 66%?
2. Will the low fee work with Steam? I don't really know the difference. BitPay gives me 15 minutes to make the transaction.
_EDIT:_ I tried putting it on low priority and the price did not change at all.

I figured it out. You were wrong about the wallet. See the OP.
@_date: 2017-06-28 11:03:43
That's literally the opposite of what you said before.
