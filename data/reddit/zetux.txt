I've always used LocalBitcoins since it is instant and requires no deposits. It just works best for me I guess.

When sending BTC on the main android wallet application, you have the option to type the amount in fiat value or direct BTC value.
For example, if I owed a friend $5.00, I'd simply type $5.00 into the send box and the application would automatically calculate the amount of BTC to send based upon current exchange prices.

LocalBitcoins.com is the best solution for the UK. Online bank transfers are instant and free. They use escrow to protect both buyers and sellers. We actually have it very easy in the UK!

Just bought a few coins there and my wallet updated straight away.

Mainly big mining companies mine using professional mining equipment (look up ASIC machines) in large mining pools. To get into bitcoins you need to buy on an exchange.

Precisely. You can send coins to it but you'd have to get the wallet online before sending coins out of it. Or you could hand someone the paper wallet.

No problem. Make sure you back them up somewhere else secure too, you wouldn't want the drives to corrupt!

LocalBitcoins is generally instant in the UK. Bank transfers can be done online and are instant (and free). The spread is still pretty big despite the majority of transactions being instant bank transfers.

Sorry to break it to you, but mining on that system will not be profitable.
Bitcoin mining has become very difficult recently, and as a result, the cost to run a system (electricity wise) now outweighs the reward.

An offline (cold storage wallet) is the safest method. Do a Google search there is many tutorials on how to securely create offline wallets.

Are tips compulsory in the US or something? That seems pretty rude to be asked for a tip.
