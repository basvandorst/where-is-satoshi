It depends on whether your business wants to convert its bitcoin revenue into fiat.
Anyone can generate a free bitcoin wallet and accept bitcoin for free and without the help of a third party company.
Those fees are to pay someone to convert into USD or EUR or other fiat currencies.  You don't need them if your business plans to keep BTC (maybe your suppliers will accept bitcoin...) 
Your business might get a lower fee or better effective exchange rate if you directly trade your bitcoins on an exchange.  Companies like coinbase collect fees because they do that for you.

What e-commerce suite does your business use?  Most of the open-source ones have open-source bitcoin payment plugins.  Try searching github
For example, if you use OpenCart then this plugin will let you accept bitcoin  (it uses Mt Gox to determine the latest exchange rate... that shouldn't be too hard to fix) but otherwise does not rely on a third party.
Or if you were using WP e-commerce, see  which is totally self contained.

Let me add: it's not too hard to do this yourself.
Many exchanges offer 'auto trading', so that BTC deposits will automatically be sold to the highest open bid.  Withdrawing the USD will include a fee.
I AM NOT RECOMMENDING BTC-e, but to give an idea of fee structure they would charge a 0.2% fee on the BTC-&gt;USD trade and then a 1.5% fee to withdraw fiat via wire transfer.  So if coinbase's fees are &gt;1.7%, something like this might save money.
But again, I AM NOT RECOMMENDING BTC-e.
