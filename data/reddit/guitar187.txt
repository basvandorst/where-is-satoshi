Here's a dime to get you started @_date: 2015-01-11 18:51:29
Here's another dime on me.  Pay it forward to your friend @_date: 2016-06-03 14:50:54

The guy doesn’t understand anything about Bitcoin, but shotguns the next question without letting them complete an answer to the last question..

So this does pay the user to surf the Internet?   Sorry, I'm just confused.   If so, that's s big win

Highly disappointing.  Doesn't it make sense to transfer value from the advertiser to the user?   Paying the user for impressions?   
Why would someone pay the host to access something they can get for free?   I don't see a lot of people paying to remove adds at this stage of the game.

I don't have a direct plan.  But I do think the problem is solvable.

Love to see the early adopters get rewarded.   Patrick really put himself out there and probably took a lot of criticism from peers, board members, etc.   Good to see visionaries get the respect they deserve.

I understand that there is clear volatility in the growth rate over time...  But, one could make the case that the projected trend is off.   It's clearly pegged to the last two years (which is fine), but there are many ways the network can grow at higher rates.

You should also read the older predictions (2012) to get an idea of how inaccurate he's been

He's literally been saying this for weeks.. Sooner or later the price will go up due to an "unknown" event.  He failed completely in June, but sooner or later he'll be right
