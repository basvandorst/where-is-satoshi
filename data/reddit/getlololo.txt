If I convert crypto A to crypto B where there’s a negligible difference in price, that is, crypto A equals crypto B. I’ve gained no money. Do I still pay taxes on that?
Note: I didn’t convert to fiat in between.
If you have personal loans, school loans, etc, will your short and long term capital gains be taxed less?

Haha, would you prefer it just say HODL? I was torn between the two.

Can we take the fees used to purchase cryptos to reduce the amount of taxes we pay?

It sucks now. But if you believe in bitcoin, you should be confident it’ll get over this rough time.

So I'm pretty sure I understand what you're saying and I'll try to highlight what confused me in the first place.
If I buy crypto A for 1 USD and over some time period, it's now worth 10 USD.
Now, if I convert crypto A straight into crypto B (skipping fiat) where crypto B is also 10 USD then I've created a taxable event despite not generating any profit in the form of fiat.
That is, I'll need to pay taxes on the total profit from crypto A at 9 USD per crypto A token.
The main confusion I had was that I have gained no profit in terms of fiat and I never converted to fiat in between the conversion. I'd understand if I went from crypto A to fiat to crypto B.
In this scenario, it's not like my quality of life or fiat holdings increased.
It's comparable to say, if I bought house A for 100 USD and it's now worth 500 USD. My friend who owns house B which is also worth 500 USD. If my friend and I decided to switch houses for mutually beneficial reasons, I'd have to pay taxes on the 400 USD "profit" on my house. That's pretty ridiculous IMO.

I believe I understand what you're saying. I'll flush out an example to confirm later today. Thank you!

I guess what I'm wondering is what tax will I be paying? If the conversion from one crypto to another doesn't yield any capital gains.
