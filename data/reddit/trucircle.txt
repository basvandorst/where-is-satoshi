Yo, hit me up with some you-bees, bro.
@_date: 2014-05-12 07:13:00
I'm sure kids are never going to learn about binary digits in school!
@_date: 2014-05-04 20:24:02
*fist bump*
@_date: 2014-08-24 21:51:15
What value do you think it will reach, and why?
@_date: 2014-05-03 19:01:44
It'll be confusing when you order a bit coin for $10000 off eBay and get something worth only 100 Satoshis.
@_date: 2014-05-10 13:54:28
Pretty sure that it's not only neckbeards who like women.
@_date: 2014-07-14 09:36:48
Dutch people aren't native English speakers and say a lot of things wrong.
@_date: 2014-08-03 21:38:17
Use the new site shapeshift.io and you don't even need to set up an account ;)
@_date: 2014-05-03 19:43:03
It'll be economical to make it if I call it a BIT COIN and sell it for $3000 on eBay.

5 ubits @_date: 2014-05-11 17:02:53
@_date: 2014-05-12 13:53:59
Have a youbee ;)
1 uBit @_date: 2014-08-04 19:47:37
I'm happier with my employer not seeing everything I spend my salary on.
@_date: 2014-08-04 21:12:46
Hmm?  But if you make a new address, you don't have money in it, do you?  So you need to send money to it from one of your other Bitcoin addresses.  And then the stalker will see where the money came from, on the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-05-10 13:51:07
Excuse me?!  Why can't women dress sexily without you putting them down?
@_date: 2014-05-22 13:47:09
Kind of ruins the gesture if you say the dollar amount, especially if it's less than a few cents.
You wouldn't ask how much a handwritten and hand-delivered thank-you letter cost.
@_date: 2014-05-11 16:12:55
Yeah, I'm worried about a government somewhere turning its resources to the goal of a 51% attack on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-07 20:31:41
How big would it be if it had had to handle as many transactions as VISA?






@_date: 2014-05-11 18:21:37
75 ubits @_date: 2014-05-11 17:34:27
Nah, give him B uBit instead.  @_date: 2014-05-10 13:50:17
Excuse me!  Just because a woman is sexually attractive, doesn't mean she doesn't have a brain.  And just because men like looking at her, doesn't mean she's an object and not a person.
Kindly take your misogyny elsewhere!
@_date: 2014-05-11 17:22:19
How are bits better than uBits?
@_date: 2014-05-11 17:01:11
People would complain if there were 8 bits in a bit.
@_date: 2014-06-06 14:26:44
Well, they could put the kibosh on it at least.
@_date: 2014-08-03 10:57:17
Bits?  Let's call them uBits instead.
@_date: 2014-05-10 13:53:35
Looks to me like you're the one doing the objectifying.  Most people don't have problems accepting that attractive women can be intelligent and good people.
@_date: 2014-03-11 12:36:51
So why is this not irony?
@_date: 2014-05-11 18:09:09
Can someone ELI5 without the video?
@_date: 2014-06-18 09:51:13
Call them uBits.  People call Bitcoins 'bits'.
^(1 uBit = 1µBitcoin)
@_date: 2014-09-12 17:28:01
Thank goodness my payment history is kept secret with Bitcoin!
Unless I buy my Bitcoins from someone using my real identity.
Or use them to buy something.
@_date: 2014-05-11 15:45:13
Bitcoin will change the world, if the 51% attack potential problem is eliminated.
@_date: 2014-05-03 15:42:50
What do you call a coin of a bit?
@_date: 2014-05-12 07:51:47
No need to use fractions.  Join the uBit train!
1 ubit @_date: 2014-05-11 19:26:28
I don't see a vote on the name there.
@_date: 2014-05-11 17:30:23
A uBit is a µBitcoin.
1 ubit @_date: 2014-05-03 18:39:36
I want to buy a physical coin of a bit, as a gift for someone.  It's a bit coin.
@_date: 2014-05-11 17:32:48
Or, as non-technical people will say, there are a million bit coins in a bit coin.
@_date: 2014-05-11 17:58:30
No, we should keep the 'Bitcoin' unit.  It's useful.
@_date: 2014-05-11 17:57:40
B ubit @_date: 2014-05-12 07:53:22
There is for that.
@_date: 2014-05-11 19:24:35
The way that non-technical people don't call every handheld console a 'game boy'?
The way that even technical people didn't think that the Wii U was a Wii add-on?
@_date: 2014-05-04 20:09:52
That's cheap for what it is.
@_date: 2014-05-22 13:50:30
I tend to tip (u)bits, not cents.
@_date: 2014-06-05 14:27:16
Well one of the main risks for Bitcoin was that the US would try and ban it.  With Wall Street on the way and increasing dotcom interest, that will hopefully be a worry of the past by the end of the year.
@_date: 2014-07-31 14:23:23
Obviously it's a joke.  I agree it should be removed though.
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:23:29
What was all that 'to the moon' stuff about then?
@_date: 2014-09-09 17:41:52
They're to do it, so they say.  Hence the single quotes.
@_date: 2014-06-06 14:37:33
Before it reached $1 million.
@_date: 2014-05-11 17:04:15
Nah, people are interested in 'disruptive technologies'.
