So how do signatures continue to validate if the side chain disappears?
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:32:29
My understanding is that segwit transactions are maintained on a side chain with periodic links back to the main bitcoin block chain. Where does this side chain live? The various wiki pages and blog articles about SegWit I've read haven't been very helpful in clarifying that.

If I use SegWit, and my transactions aren't on the main blockchain, where do they live and how they maintain perpetual validity?
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:41:02
Lightning Network is an implementation of SegWit.

Why does that log graph have a zero origin?

Oh come on, this stinks of incompetence not coverup.

None of them match the situation unless you can explain that better. (protip: Alanis Morissette doesn't know what irony is, either).

You've described transaction malleability, but not the result of MtGox detecting that the transaction id they saved was not the one that ended up on the blockchain. As a result of the transaction id changing, MtGox would have attempted to resend the same amount to the same recipient, falsely believing the first transaction had failed.

They gave them away accidentally over the period of years due to transaction malleability and resent transactions.

Ugh, why does zapchain require a Facebook login? There's no fucking way I'm creating a Facebook account just for this.
@_date: 2014-10-03 22:13:20
According to [this]( it won't half for another 2 years.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:41:53
Bad analogy.

You would notice pairs of transactions of the same amount to the same address from MtGox.  I suspect if it's been an ongoing problem for the past several months (or years), it would be challenging to detect them all, especially if there were a lot of small withdrawals from MtGox accounts.

Why is everyone expecting a robbery when it's very likely they've been leaking BTC for years?  They just haven't been doing their accounting properly.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:08:13
Given their shitty implementation of their bitcoin accounting, that wouldn't surprise me.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:23:29
They were not stolen.  They were accidentally given away in small amounts over a large period of time.
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:44:08
No. No it doesn't. There is zero resemblance between the two.
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:05:58
Mt Gox has been leaking bitcoins for over a year by double-sending to external accounts because of transaction malleability. There's no big chunk that was stolen, just lots and lots of little transactions where they double or triple-sent bitcoins.  This is why there's no "smoking gun" transaction and it's difficult to account for all of the bitcoins that were lost.
I don't get why this subreddit doesn't understand such a simple and straightforward explanation for what happened.  Everyone is jumping on the bandwagon of theft and malice, when stupidity and bad accounting will suffice.

Did you even read the first 3 sentences from your link?


During the early Middle Ages, virtually all scholars maintained the spherical viewpoint first expressed by the Ancient Greeks. From at least the 14th century, **belief in a flat Earth among the educated was almost nonexistent**.
@_date: 2015-08-14 22:53:48
Yes, people are forced to educated themselves about how the world works, otherwise they are left out. Bitcoin doesn't just take the place of investment.
@_date: 2015-08-20 16:07:41
What about it? There's no evidence that the majority of people *ever* believed in a flat Earth. Did you even read the citation?
