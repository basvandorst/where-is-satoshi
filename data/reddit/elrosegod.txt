he mentions the Dot.com bubble in the article. I don't think old fiat currency billionaires really have the vision; I almost want to say they know the dangers of it. BTC/ ETH/ Crypto** is betting against big wigs in the financial world.

I love his twitter. I got on twitter just to follow him. "I did 36 hours of coding, that's a lot of cocaine!"
We all know Nootropics are the chosen stimulant of any diehard programmer. That and Bawls energy drink. Duh.

Those are the developers who helped Satoshi in 2009-presently? I can research the names. But that's pretty stupid that they would openly support someone so blatantly self serving. I would definitely lean alien theory. Lots of aliens and pizza.

hahah, just in case.

Are you joking. That's ridiculous. That's a

What is the scoop on this guy? From the thread, it seems he's trying to convince people he is Satoshi?
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:55:00
LMAO. Right, man it sucks when you buy at the very peak and then everything flash crashes....

Is it an end game to hold on to BitCoin until a few economies collapse? 
@_date: 2017-06-30 13:08:46
That's not very like the soft spoken Satoshi. 
Yeah, that's pretty aggressive, especially on all the patents, something just seems very fishy for someone claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto, when the original white paper was to decentralize banks and his whole platform was to start collaboration and get people to originally use bitcoin and give it power.
 And he's claiming litigation against people calling him a fraud? LMAO. It's not libel/slander if it's true. Honestly, I hope the Genesis block of bitcoin is never found...

Yeah this meme doesn't provide enough reasoning to this proof point.

Star Wars, republic credits. But accordingly on Naboo, there is not gold standard on republic credits, so, not accepted in the outlands, unfortunately.

I'd love to poke holes in this guy's argument and company practices. This sometimes makes me want to be a lawyer with a scope on IT litigation spaces. However, business law protects the business owner (United States). I wouldn't know how to start with International/Global litigation on a space such as intellectual property on web/cloud/ p2p technologies. I guess one interpretation is how they pursued the curators of Pirate Bay.
