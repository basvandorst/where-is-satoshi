Could you please advise for my situation?:
Purchased 2 coins for about $400 USD. Sold .7 coins for $400 to recoup initial investment. Still have 1.3 coins on Coin base. What would my tax obligation be?

My mom sent me this when I told her I got some bitcoin: 
Pretty amusing. The TL;DR is essentially, "You should buy my 'secret currency' that I won't tell you about unless you pay me money"

Am I missing something? The site you linked has Coinbase rated 1st...

What of I use my bitcoin to buy stuff? Is a paper wallet easy to do that with? That's kinda the only reason I haven't moved my coins...

Sold .7 to go back into my bank account, and when I closed the confirmation window, the site was down :(  Hope nothing gets messed up.

How would one find the bitcoins on a recovered hard drive?

Dang, kicking myself right now.  Signed up for an account a couple months back when the price was about $100 usd. Now its over $200.  Could have already made my money back...
