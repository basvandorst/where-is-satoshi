No, to the blockchain your wallet still own those coins. You can re send with a higher fee and your old transaction wouldn't be processed since it was already spent.

Without a log scale, the chart comparison means nothing.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:15:21
I would think that's the other way around. The blockchain not moving is forcing people to hold, since they can't get their coins in the exchange.

Yes, big blocks by themselves have no future, cant make something scalable mantaining the complexity. At this point if bch really takes over, bitcoin like coins are pretty much dead.

This is retarded. If it's used as currency the value is the market price when the transaction happens, not whatever happens with the coin later that day or in a couple years. 
You could have paid him in btc, and use the extra 350 you had now to buy the btc back, or even double it and nothing would have changed.

Do you think that this will just be a wagon switch and everyone will act as if nothing happened?. 
This shows how can a couple whales with money and hashing power can bend the market at their will. If you were some layman, would you rather have the government and banks watching over your money or some Chinese dudes that answer to none?

Bigger blocks is not scaling so Segwit has no competition as a solution. If somehow BCH "wins" this round, bitcoin like currencies are done.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:08:47
That's for bch. BTC has a long way ahead.

They don't control it. Anyone can announce a fork and then cancel it.

Difficulty ajusts every 2016 blocks. If the chain loses too much hash power blocks can't be solved and the difficulty won't retarget. Mining bch is way too profitable for an instant return right now, and btc retarget is really far away.
Either it goes back to normal with the bch retarget tomorrow, or we will need a hard fork to reset the difficulty.

A tx will never be dropped because the fee is low, it will stay in the mempool untill it's picked by a miner, that might take just 1 block, or a few days depending how full the mempool is. For example, a transaction with less than 10 sat/B would take a a lot right now, 2 days ago it would have taken 2-3 blocks maximum.
The tx can be rejected if the package is invalid, the functions are not accepted, the signatures are incorrect, the referenced coins were already spent and so on.

Transactions are spread to the network when you broadcast it, but it doesnt get appended to the blockchain untill the miner that gets the next block picks it and hashes it. What you see in the wallet is a copy of the message that you broadcasted, but it could be rejected by the network once it gets mined.

Its creates far more orphans (most of them still get appended to the blockchain as uncles), but it doesnt mean the transactions are lost. They are just picked by someone else.

Thanks to them I can sit in a computer and buy Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:40:09
Yes, there can be orphans if a transaction on the uncle makes a conflict with the main block, like a double spent attack processed differently or so. Its very unlikely tho.

So, you go buy a lunch with debit card, then you have to stand there a few minutes for the confirmation and also pay an extra $2 for the fee?, doesnt seems to be a good idea.
