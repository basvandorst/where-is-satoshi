"Coinbase is getting too fucking big to align itself with Bitcoin's ideologies."
Guess what, the ideologies don't matter, and there are no "Bitcoin's ideologies" just those that you decided to follow when you jumped in.
Sorry to be blunt but emotions shouldn't drive your decisions, and you shouldn't expect others to share the same beliefs as you.

No, the result of MtGox having poor internal controls / architecture / etc. is that a lot of people were ripped off.

Did you see this?  He never assured of MtGox's solvency and apologized if he gave that impression.  And he likely lost many multiples of what you or anyone you know did.  And BTW, did you really base your decision to stick with MtGox on the video testimony of a third party?  How about taking action for your own decisions.

Read and you'll find you're wrong, but even if they were so what?  Sad to see ppl who think like this on r/bitcoin

Flash News: Bitcoin is already mainstream, and the exchange doesn't need to be regulated to get there:

What do you think about this then?
When building something new (in this case with Quoine, an exchange that allows for BTC shorting, margin lending, derivatives, etc.), I think it's important to build something yourself rather than rely on third-party software.  Looks like gemini is trying to build something similar, but the sad thing is that to build it in the US you need to wait for it to be regulated, and competitors (such as Quoine) end up having a head start (which is everything in this business).
