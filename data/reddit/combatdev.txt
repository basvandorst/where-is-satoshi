I feel like FIAT should be the wave, and BItcoin should be the “you are here”

Coinbase custody has only 10 customers, half of which are related to their own products. 
Coinbase is pivoting away from institutional focus.

"positive news segments" like the John Oliver segment? what a joke.

this is such bad advice. Never dump a risky asset, for an even riskier asset.

In my humble opinion, I would consider that regulating trade/commerce and not the currency itself. 
Fundamentally, there is nothing preventing you from owning/possessing €5000 euro, right? 
Contrast that to securities regulations that from the consumer perspective does in fact focus on ownership of the assets.

The manipulation was propping up the price, not dropping it down.

How does the possibility of central bank's QE and subsequent fiat inflation affect the investment prospects of Bitcoin? 
QE affects the buying power of fiat, it won't have an effect on the buying power of Bitcoin. This would change if Bitcoin was widely used as a replacement for fiat.
But the OP is recommending  people hodl Bitcoin as a speculative investment, not to use as a means of payment.

Yes, this is how QE works, they buy assets (usually securities/bonds) with fiat, counterparty receives fiat and it circulates.  When they want to deflate their fiat, they sell these assets back, where the counterparty gives them fiat back -- and they remove it from circulation. 
The assets they purchase are effectively infinite though, so I'm not really following your point about them buying all the assets. You're suggesting they will buy up all of the bonds and securities available, and be forced to buy bitcoin? That's pretty extreme. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:24:14
it's hilarious that you think bitcoin is only manipulated in one direction.

The previous market cycles operated in unregulated space, that's over now.

Saved for future lols.

Currencies aren't regulated. Securities are. You're not going to do well in your debate if you don't understand that.

It's clear the market wanted lower than 6k prices, which is why all the pumps that occurred when ever we dipped down to 6k were manipulation. Largely in part by Bitfinex.

Outside of the "regulation" maintained by a central bank, how are they regulated?

Bakkt is not confirmed! It hasn't been approved, which is why it was delayed. Their recent announcement is similar to the announcement they initially released for December.

Of course :)

Not quite — this isn’t for personal accounts. 
Coinbase will secure institutional (big accounts) crypto funds in bulk, and insure them against loss. 
Currently, they only hold and secure personal funds that are secured up to $250k. 
This is required for coinbase to move forward with their roadmap in securities and institutional trading.

When you realize your naive idealism has lost you thousands of dollars...
@_date: 2018-07-02 21:12:18
Something tells me you don’t have the 10 million dollar requirement to have a custodial account. So chill. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 01:36:10
And the purchasing power of crypto is what? Zero...since no one accepts.  ZING
@_date: 2018-07-03 12:52:54
Having such an ardent opinion on something that will never affect you, is silly. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 13:01:21
Lol, what? If coinbase is “beanie baby store”, what exchange is more legit to you? Binance? Lol
