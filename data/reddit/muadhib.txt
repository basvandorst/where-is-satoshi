Right, I understand that credit cards aren't banks, but most online banking makes that distinction somewhat seamless. I can accumulate money in my bank account, view my account balances, and pay off my monthly credit card bill in less than three minutes. 
I also understand why merchants would like it. But why would responsible credit card users want to switch?

Do you think so? If businesses are running profitably with this percentage skim taking place, then why lower prices? Consumers were already willing to pay at that price and the business was making money. Now it will make more money. I love the idea of efficient markets, but I am skeptical of that result. 
But I guess my original question is more on the consumer side. Why would a responsible credit card user want to switch to Bitcoin rather than a credit card company? Does Bitcoin offer financing at lower interest rates than credit card companies?

Wonderful answer, thanks.
Could I trouble you for a little more depth on these "miners" and Blockchain? What is this and how does it work, exactly?

Thanks, this is great.

What about Paypal? It transfers money and doesn't leave you exposed to Bitcoin/$ exchange rates.

I see, so Paypal charges a premium for the exchange. Does Bitcoin not have service charges or membership fees?

Right, so I am asking from the perspective of responsible credit card user. If I make timely monthly payments on my credit card, I don't pay percentage rates and I still gain the benefit of theft protection. Though I grant your point it is a pain to report.
So then my question is how Bitcoin can assure there is no fraudulence. It has to validate ownership of an asset- how does it do this? And why would I want to expose myself to any volatility in Bitcoin/$ exchange rates when a credit card company can provide me both security and fluid transactions without any cost (again, assuming I am a responsible credit card user)

Haha, interesting. Thanks. Okay, this is eliciting a lot more questions. So are the transactions  always denominated in  national currency? If so, is your account always in flux? Your 20 bitcoins could be 40 dollars today, but 80 dollars tomorrow, right? Isn't this incredibly disconcerting?
