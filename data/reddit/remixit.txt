Atm its decentralised money only for people who run their own nodes, everyone else is still forced to use third parties

Yes, both 3rd parties that have full control over your coins and their security. They can be hacked on any given day and all your coins will be gone.
Also what happens if 1 of these 3rd parties decides to go rogue... again?
Lol idiots

Why because you think the likes of trezor or armory are invulnerable to attack or corruption? lol

Its not about clicking anything sir, if you would have read/understood the question you would know that already

Yes, free to choose a third party... LOL

Maybe but as the OP said, and for various reasons, that isnt a viable option for everyone. 
Also as the OP said; Bitcoin isnt supposed to be only for people who can run their own nodes, its supposed to be 100% decentralised money for everyone.

Nope, and neither did I say I had, all I said was atm bitcoin is not providing what it was intended to provide

Of course, but its that very problem with the US Govt that led to the creation of Bitcoin, as it was supposed to alleviate people of said problem.
BUt unfortunately it isnt doing that, and 3rd parties are still a requirement, at least for the vast majority of people anyway

Well I know what independent storage and transfer of currency is and I know that atm Bitcoin is not it
