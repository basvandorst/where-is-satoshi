I don't know it the site is owned by Ver. I would make sense then.
To me, their logic sounded alright. Could you point out what you thought was illogical?
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:43:29
I could not find anything that would let me predict which coin will prevail with certainty.
I agree. It is not wise to buy all altcoins. It is, however, not unwise to hold some positions in contrast to only one.
@_date: 2018-01-10 10:26:53


Very, very hard, I imagine. I could think of adoption as a way to determine consensus, but that's flawed, too.


The propaganda machines run for both sides.
But apart from that, I'm not necessarily referencing Bitcoin Cash with what I wrote before. It is more of a general approach having in mind future forks.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:06:18
Oh, you meant to say "let them go ahead"?
I read the article as a whole. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:50:51
Yes, correct. This describes the current situation.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:30:59
I don't think so. I mean it is conclusive if you support that idea. I wouldn't know which coin prevails.
Could you elaborate why you are that certain that it will never happen?
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:32:40
Could you shed more light on you points. I have done some transactions over the last months. The duration of the transaction was at around 2 hours with a transaction fee of about 35 USD.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:28:08
I think what they meant with negative momentum was the high transaction fees and the long transaction durations.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:38:49
19.35 USD. I do not choose the fees. They are calculated by the exchange of my choice.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:36:43
Then thank you anyway.
I have done quite some research. The real dilemma is that both sides to the coin seem very coclusive.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:02:42
I don't know. It's not always the better technology that outright gains the momentum. HDDVD vs Bluray. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:16:44
Is it really? Most certainly on this sub. On the however it's quite the opposite.
Unfortunately, I have no empiric data regarding the general public.
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:28:41
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:35:27


How would you determine what the real bitcoin is?


That is code, a hard fork of BITCOIN took place at block night 504031, that hard fork is know as BITCOIN CASH
This is fact. Am I missing something? Why did you write that?


I see. Do you reckon they are wrong in trying to do so?
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:41:23
Most prominently, yes. In its wholeness, there are as many angles to consider as there are alt coins.
Bitcoin Diamond and Bitcoin Gold don't seem to get a lot of traction.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:25:09


I agree with that. I think that would be wisest.
I have done quite some research. Not being able to certainly tell which coin will prevail in the future is the real dilemma. There seem to be facts supporting both ideas and it seems like with many things in life that there is no black and white, but many grey shades.
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:56:08
Facts are important, but so is perception in the news and general public. I guess it's wise to hold both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 10:08:31


I'm looking for some argument a little more conclusive. Could you continue? I think it's safe to say and deduce what is the original version and what is the forked off product. However, I would argue that nomenclature of both products is an entirely different subject and - in contrast to the origin of both coins - could be changed if consensus is found.


This is an interesting thought and I will remember it.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:13:17
Why do you think that would be the better analogy?
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:27:22
Can you elaborate why you think that nobody considered their site trustworthy?
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:17:40
Is it?
To me, their logic sounded alright. Could you point out what you thought was illogical?
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:46:39


Could you elaborate why you think that is common sense?


I see. Could you point out where those people actually deny that Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork of Bitcoin. I have not seen that yet. Even on  it says that Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork. What I see is that those people stand up for Bitcoin Cash being dubbed Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:29:01
Which agenda do you reckon that is?
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:28:39
@_date: 2018-01-10 10:24:52

I agree with that.
@_date: 2018-01-10 10:04:38


That's a good question. I thought since they were the once that brought us Bitcoin, it would be fair to call a version of Bitcoin "Bitcoin" that comes closest to what they wanted to achieve.


I agree with it being a fork. However, when it comes to naming both what is forked and what is original, I am unsure as described above. I could see it going both ways.


That would be news to me. Is it not conceivable that the majority would also turn and support the fork.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:39:04
Then thank you anyway.
I have done quite some research. The real dilemma is that both sides to the coin seem very coclusive.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:26:45
I thought the whole article was conclusive if you see Bitcoin Cash prevailing over Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-12 09:41:36
Shoulda put a strawpoll in the OP if you wanted a strawpoll...
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:40:49
Most prominently, yes.
In its wholeness, there are as many angles to consider as there are alt coins.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:20:41
Is it designed to confuse people? Why do you think that rather than them just wanting to support what they think is the real Bitcoin?
Could you elaborate why you mentioned Roger?
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:49:51
I see.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:49:07
This is where I am torn. One the one side it makes sense to refer to all forked coins as alt coins with their own respective names.
On the other side I can also understand that if you argue that at some point a forked version of Bitcoin comes closer to the ideals of Nakamoto, it would make sense to call that forked version Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:56:30
Go ahead with what?
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:04:29
This might be true for you.
What I mean is, it is probably wise for me to hold both since I am not confident enough to declare that one coin will prevail over then other mid- to long-term.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:25:33
Why do you think they should not be trusted?
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:36:56
Then thank you anyway.

I actually like that the crowd is mute. Makes it seem like an evil mastermind monologue in a movie.

It's tax free if there's more than one year between your initial investment and your withdrawal. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:17:42
Can you please explain how to do this?
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:31:19
How can you tell that this process is no "zinstragende Veranlagung", which – according to the paragraph right above the one your quoted sentences comes from – would be subject to taxes in the amount of 27,5%?
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:28:13
I took a look at Sec 31 EStG and it mentions that the profit is tax free up to an amount of 440€ only. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:32:30
Thank you for the explanation!
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:18:15
I'm not Austrian, but could u explain how that works?

With all the advances in bioengineering and technology in general, I wouldn't be so confident that we're all gonna be dead by 2140. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 16:19:50
Are those sources also open to the general public? What are those sources?
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:00:06
I think neither of them did BTC or BCH a solid.

I'll take your word for it, but adoption sure took long.

Doesn't mean he's gonna be right this time, though.
