Well, the fact that he was accused of fraud is actually relevant.

@_date: 2014-05-16 12:30:31
Right. Some entities like Google and BerkHa don't split because they don't need normal people to invest money in them. But to use BTC, you have to buy. BTC won't succeed in the long run without mainstream users.

We as a community need to demand transparency from exchanges before we give them our business. Gox had been showing warning signs for a long time, but people ignored the situation and continued to do business with them.
Thankfully, people are starting to take this shit more seriously. For example, I've seen people starting to worry about the fact that BTC-e is anonymous and opaque.

Cold storage is for storing large amounts of coins for a long period of time. Think savings account.

@_date: 2014-04-29 11:38:46
Why does it seem like people only consider two possibilities for the future of Gox? At least the only two I see thrown around are:
1. Liquidation of everything including the BTC that they "found." Still iffy on exactly how much they have, and who would get the money.
2. Revival as a new company.
Why can't they just give back the BTC in proportion and liquidate everything else?
@_date: 2014-02-27 11:11:50
Covering your investment at some point sounds pretty reasonable, but why set a profit goal? Like Warren Buffet, I prefer investments with a holding period of "forever." You can call it greedy but I call it smart.
Like Political_douche said, you missed the point. You should of learned not to leave your coins on an exchange for long periods of time, and to never trade more than your willing to lose on a single exchange.

While the parties don't have a policy on BTC yet, I strongly suspect that Hillary is anti-BTC.

Yeah, but how is that fair? They basically forced the creditors to have their funds tied up for years while this thing gets resolved. And in the meantine, the creditors should have had a massive windfall but the person who caused the entire fiasco gets in instead.

I have no clue how the Japanese legal system says this should be done, but what will happen to any coins left after enough have been sold to cover everyone's USD equivalent balance? Do they all get sold as well and the money gets divided among creditors? I imagine the whole thing is an accounting nightmare.

If I had this opportunity, I'd hold some bitcoin and come back in half an hour. 3.5 years is hella long in bitcoin time, but the people on earth wouldn't have aged to the point where I'd feel terrible about missing out on their lives. 
Of course, if you don't have a lot of people you personally care about you could always dump everything in a market etf and come back in 50 years earth time. Hell, make it 75 or 100.
