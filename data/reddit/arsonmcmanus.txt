In light of current events, I went back and re-listened to episode 844 of the Joe Rogan podcast with Andre Antonopoulos. It really made me believe in BTC and cryptocurrency and the potential to help globally.

Coinbase charges more to buy and gives you less when you sell. It's part of their fee model.

It'll have its up and downs. See where it is in a year.

This is the correction that people were expecting 2 weeks ago. All the people that bought Bitcoin because they saw it on the news got bored with it.

I've looked all over but I can't find the exact time when futures trading starts, everywhere just says 'Sunday'?

I recently went back and watched this podcast again. The guest has written a few books on bitcoin. He explains some of the terminology and explains some of the philosophy behind cryptocurrency.

Decide what price you think it's worth buying at and wait for that, or don't.

I think their systems are overworked. Hard to blame them though since their app is responsible for so much growth. You can use another exchange if you're not happy with coinbase.

The issue is that someone would inevitably try to take 'ownership' of the system and then it loses all it's integrity. It's better for small investors before it gets bogged down in regulation.

Just keep trying. Or buy on credit for higher fees

It's not the professional traders fucking things up, it's all the noobs who bought Bitcoin after seeing an article about it on Buzzfeed a week ago. They thought it would be a get rich quick scheme, then they saw a dip and ran.
