Okay, from 3 to 10%. Like a targetpro say: Happy bitcoin days.
I think we need to stay in positive position because Bitcoin is very good currency.

i love statistics
1000 consumers. lets say 500 male 500 females
so 650 people would not use bitcoin
500 males = 320 males knew of bitcoin 180 did not
500 females = 190 females knew of bitcoin 310 did not
meaning 510 total people did know of about bitcoin
meaning 490 total people did not know about bitcoin what so ever 
so out of the 510 that did know about it 140 still would not use bitcoin. and 370 would use bitcoin
37% of todays population  will in "FUTURE POSSIBLY" adopt bitcoin.. sounds good to me
now if everyone atleast knew about it rather than just half the population.. then the possible adoption would be over 70%

loans is most riskiest
mining is slightly less risky
trading on exchanges is slightly less risky
best bet is to find a product that will sell well, find a cheap manufacturer/distributor/supplier and buy it. then sell for a 20%-100% profit. keep the profit and then rebuy more stock. repeat as often as you can.
research drop shipping where you only pay when you make a sale, and the drop shipper delivers straight to customer. this means no stock hoarding, not having to deal with packaging and distribution. you simply send the drop shipper the funds and delivery address

Yeah it's a shame but some websites or bitcoin services wont let you use it. I guess a lot of people will try abuse it.

I intend to know as well. If the news can be sent to my email. Then my Iphone will get instantly as well. I think it is a great opportunity for BTC start up companies who plan to focus on BTC data analysis. The first hand news or data can guide our trading.

Hmm. Good point.
Possible solution is to print some type of verification hash on it that includes the address and timestamp?

It's going to be like that until we can give the public more of a good reason to at least give bitcoin a try. We are fighting with those who enjoy trying to make bitcoin look bad by constantly finding the negatives and not letting people know of the positives. The longer bitcoin is around and the more that can be done with it the better chance there is of it becoming more popular.

One positive for Australians
Australia economic survival relies on just the iron ore price.
If the Chinese furiously move capacity into building mining facilities this could prop the iron ore price and save the Australian economy.
Otherwise its Detroit.
We really should have tried to globally corner the market on iron ore.

I would just do 10 paper wallets with 10 Bitcoins in each - there is no real need to diversify wallet types, just diversify the coins

In other words I hate you busy beaver why didn't you post this Yesterday when the sale was still on XD
But 75 dollars off on purchases over 300 dollars isn't a bad discount 
Someone knows that the Bitcoin exchange rate is low and is willing to take that discount into account and still make more in the long run lol.

While Bitcoin remains volatile their is no problem using stable units of currency as a unit of value while Bitcoin is used both as a secure payment mechanism and than stored as bitcoin so individuals don't lose their money through the theft of taxation or inflation. 
Using Fiat like the USD or Euro as the unit of value during a transaction doesn't support fiat outside of psychological recognition those are more stable currencies. In the future when bitcoin stabilizes more this will also drop.

Best bet if you do plan to go all in please do it over a long period of time and all at once.  That way you have options and are able to buy in for cheaper should the price go much lower.  Even if your going to gamble you do it with a plan to profit and play it safe.  I'm sure many of the experienced traders and gamblers would agree with that in some ways. 
Not investment advice of course, I'm just speculating on the best way to go about it..

Money's future is Bitcoin because its spreading around the world and can take place of fiat but its need too much awareness about this

Thats silly. spend all that money to raid someone just for an alleged plant?

Do you have a good solid reason why they should continue to exist? Do you think they'll perhaps adopt cryptocurrency innovations to stay ahead of the curve and survive ? Or do you reject the idea of bitcoin/alts overtaking fiat because it seems too radical.

it's ponzi for noobs ... because they buy high (they trust) and sell low (they cry).
