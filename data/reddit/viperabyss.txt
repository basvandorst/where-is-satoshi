There, FTFY.

And what benefit would that get? They don't simply accept bitcoin because it is good for the customer. They accept bitcoin because they can speculate and make more money out of it.

How would you characterize [this]( Is it trending upward?
@_date: 2014-10-14 22:04:53
Except that this is not your college 101 class where you apply linear trendline to everything. This is a very volatile speculative instrument, and it certainly is taking a dive in value in the past months, ever since hitting the $1200 mark.
I wonder who's the one demonstrating ignorance.

Difference? S&amp;P is actually backed by productivity of actual companies, and it bounced back.
Bitcoin doesn't, hasn't, and still decreasing.

It is only risk free if bitcoin's value remain constant, or increases over time. Judging by the current bitcoin value, I'd guess it isn't true?

Except the merchant processing fees are usually 3~5% of the price of the product, which most merchants have included in the sale price.
Given that bitcoin has extremely high volatility, the risk of accepting bitcoin is significantly more than merchant processing fees. This is all not to mention bitcoin is still a very small niche market.

By your logic, anyone can make an argument that AMD is "trending up", since its stock prices is higher than its price at the beginning of time.
Blind fanboyism is blind.

And out of every 10 posts, you posted 9 of them in either or &gt;Except I don't own, believe in, or particularly support Bitcoin at all
@_date: 2014-10-14 16:14:02
I don't know... Half a year ago BTC was at $1000, and now its hovering around $400, and dropping (if current trend holds). For an instrument that loses 60% of its value in 6 month makes it a really bad investment vehicle.
@_date: 2014-02-11 04:24:35
Uh... there is. If BTC drops 50% in value in a short period of time, companies would have to raisetheir price accordingly. That is the definition of volatility. What would it do to a business's reputation if they have to change the price constantly?
@_date: 2014-02-10 01:14:03
Honestly, why does this surprise anyone? The whole point of businesses accepting bitcoin is speculating the price of bitcoin will increase. If bitcoin drops in value, they'll lose out big time.

Uh huh.
Keep making up excuses to mask your utter lack of understanding. It's getting old real fast.
