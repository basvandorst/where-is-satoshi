It's still too expensive, I think that this solutions are necessary for expansion on the world, but the price should be reduced dramatically. 
Will be paper wallets for me.

Why don't we try to sponsor the people who is working towads bitcoin adoption outside the US?, for me is getting impossible to keep things working in Colombia, even with the media attention and the several conferences and forums we are doing we aren't getting donations.

We are trying to educate about Bitcoin in Colombia, The last week we did this Forum in "Universidad Externado de Colombia" the video will be soon avaliable. 
We, "Fundacion Bitcoin Colombia", are trying to reach more people, discuss in the media and with diferent government entities.
We are constantly doing meetups, interviews, presentations, and everything we can to get more people involved but we need help, financial and from the people.
Anything you want to discuss, write me at krlos

I begin knowing about Bitcoin in 2009, but didn't get involved and finally started last year in january, bought a BFL miner (I know bad invest), and start trading, reading and doing some presentations in my University.
Later I started a Bitcoin Community in Colombia, traveled to several cities talking about bitcoin, doing meetups and conferences, and eventually we are working towards the creation of "Fundacion Bitcoin Colombia", but our work is going to be Community related stuff, helping people get started, doing legal research and spread the word.
Then did this interviews.
You can also search for my posts here in i have my story all over this place. xD
@_date: 2014-10-14 23:09:53

We have an online vinyl store, we only accept crypto for payment, is  we ship directly from Colombia. 
Saddly in this 5 months we have selled just 1 vinyl, it seems that few bitcoiners like vinyl, and the vinyl lovers don't care use bitcoins. 
We are going to accept paypal because of the few support. (saddly)

I expect that in the ethereun network.
@_date: 2014-10-12 17:56:20
Being lonely is a choice, and you can change it. 
There's a lot of ways to get involved, and contact bitcoiners. 
Meetup.com is a great option. 
Facebook pages of your local  community. 
You can even get in touch with several Bitcoin organizations
Cheers and if you don't find anything near to you, start your own meetup group or even foundation as I did in Colombia. 
Cheers.

Hello Carlos from Bitcoin Colombia Here.
This is an article talking about a document that that hasn't been showed (a "circular") in wich, supposedly, Bitcoin will be banned.
In the other hand, I have a meeting with this regulatory entity the next friday (Super Intendencia Financiera de Colombia).
Just wait untill we have an official statement from them.
@_date: 2014-11-08 01:40:54

In argentina all that comerce is based on the high regulations existent and the big inflation.
In colombia is diferent, our fouces here is the electronic market instead any other type of electronic payment.
Also we have a big barrier, it's har for us to trust, the electronic commerce here is really poor, we are just experimenting with it.
So maybe we have a good chance here before we see big colombian online retailers. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 13:44:21

Good luck paying that many people.
@_date: 2016-12-31 07:29:40
I read this post really late.
No, Colombia hasn't declared Bitcoin illegal, that was just a missinterpretation of the "Super Intendente" of "Super Sociedades", we are in the same background as before, in a gray area in wich we don't know what kind of asset Bitcoin is, the government (Super Financiera - Banco de la Republica) said what kind of asset bitcoin **ISN'T** and they  never said that is illegal.
And Colombian Bitcoin usage isn't that big to say it's FUD to make the price go low. xD

@_date: 2013-11-09 03:57:10
Well, i think chinesse people are more tech savvy, and they researched bitcoins so hard, that maybe that's why they are buying more and more, they know that bitcoin is going to be a expensive asset in the future...

Hi! i'm very happy of have found about bitcoins, i think there is a great potential in this technology and want to invest any effort to make it well know in colombia.
Fisrt i'm the owner of few btc, i made them trough some mining and exchange for other cryptos, i have been trying to get in this world, but is hard now.
I wish I can do some web-based software, but i have lack of skills for that, but, what i do want is organize anything on my country, i know some people, but enough.
So, i was speaking with the president of bitcoinargentina.org, and try to organize something like that in colombia, that's what I want, and the better way i can help.
Also i have been trying to reach to all my friends, I never miss the oportunity to talk about btc, i have been doing presentations in my university and trying to get bitcoin well knowing.
Well, if you want to ask something, go ahead.
P.s Sorry for my bad use of english language.

As i have a wife, mortgage, and job, i started  a comunity created to promote bitcoins in colombia, i wish i can resignate to my current job, cuase i'm invited to do some conferences and my work is keeping me from those, i love spread the word.
An idea for san francisco is a physical place where people can trade and you can be the scrow, charge 1% of transactions, and hire a security guard, And i think that should be really good, and you're not being a money transmiter, so you might have less fees..

try simple and cheap, buy some form 2 or 3 people, they won't to lose they reputation for trades less than 500 bucks, and do this with 4 people one each hour, so you can't be secure that they won't scam you, and try to do the transactions near a bank or a police station.
Good luck!

Well, maybe yes, but in my latest conference wich i do to ~50 people who are really tech savvy i saw the missinformation.
Also saw how baddly they want to know more.
But for be really honest, i want that my country don't be left behind.

Diversify, remember that you should as well, and even if it's hard to get usd from mtgox, can help in the process of laverage. (my humble opinion and maybe wrong)
@_date: 2013-11-13 06:36:56
I wish i can do that, right now i'm working towards the adoption of bitcoin  in colombia, trough bitcoincolombia.org, but is hard when you don't have many resources. xD

Finally! some news about bitcoins here in Colombia, the hardest thing to get people gather real interest here is the huge price of a bitcoin, you can pay the minimun wage here with just 3 Bitcoins, that's why i'm supporting the use of "MilliBits" so people can think different and see it as a good investment and an easy way to store value.
I'm tryng to evangelize all i can, i maded some presentations at my university, and always try to keep taliking about BTC. I hope someday will be easy to buy and sell bitcoins here!

The best of this article it's:
* Talk about baidu, and expecified what seccion of baidu is receiving bitcoins.
* Talk about silk road, how this doesn't affect the bitcoin economy, that bitcoins are semi-anonnimous and that many legal bussines has adopted bitcoins as payment system.
* That you can buy fractions of bitcoins and how with 15 usd invested on bitcoins you can try the functionallity of the bitcoin network.

This is pretty cool, but as a Colombian i see that it's easy to buy hard to sell, and with mtgox lag sending money, and a higher price than other traders, i think localbitcoins will do it better.

@_date: 2013-04-10 03:29:54
Invest on ther cryptos, this way LTC, PPC and NMC, can be suitable aswell. 
Can invest on buying them, or invest on making services for them...

Nice work man!, i live in colombia, so is cheaper get them form china... cheers
@_date: 2013-10-22 20:38:20
in the lates bitcoin conference i did, i wish i had more to give, many eager people wanting to have some.
Maybe is going to be hard, cause many people here in colombia doesn't have internet conection and aren't very tech sawy.
That's why we are trying to implement bitcoincolombia.org as a comunity for people who wants to know more and for spread the word.
Even though if you have those paper wallets if you speak with someone who seems interested, tip it. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 04:37:24

But i will take your advice, maybe i'm naive. xD

@_date: 2013-11-06 17:52:30
i don't think so, they were doing plenty bussiness and the scrow was kindda expensive.
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:27:27

@_date: 2013-11-11 17:43:27
This is going to happen very often in any country... 
Please know you trading platform before your sending Bitcoins or money.

@_date: 2013-04-26 19:41:17

We usually said "hispano hablantes" in this way we associate all the "Spanish speakers", so I think what you said has more sense. I agree with you 
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:35:53

until somebody do a litecoin asic, i know it's expensive, but that doens't stop people....
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:22:37
Man if you watched the previous hearing they said they are working to find a way to make laws that do what they need, and avoid a big burn, with the IRS. So you should watch it if you haven't (i'm colombian and still watched it.)
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:12:02

@_date: 2013-04-16 06:03:10
keep the interest going, i'm from colombia and it's kindda the same, always make some jokes on me and ask "you're rich now? 1 bitcoin worth 1000 u$d", well, we're a little ahead of them, just keep the good work going, and evangelize xD

@_date: 2013-04-24 13:59:30
Think that you can found any trader easy with paypal, and retrieve funds easy with paypal, the arbitrage will be just easy, and for me this will be the most exiting thing if paypal supports btc. and if thy just don't block accounts for buy or sell bitcoins wold be great.
@_date: 2013-11-03 00:18:48

The best simple and good info is in bitcoin.org i made conferences and presentaions based on this, also you can use some interviews to expand your knowledge, cause, in my experience, just open many questions.
Also i usually take 45 mins to 1 hour in the presentation, and another in Q/A
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:46:56
Well i think this is good...
@_date: 2013-07-26 16:02:51
Thanks man, i will do it tomorrow, now i'm working! Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:34:08
there's plenty of traders with alts, like kraken, mxcnow, crypto-trade, vircurex and more, but btc-e is getting real attention, and in dark times like a mtgox ddos, or bitstamp (like we are now) btc-e stands.
@_date: 2013-11-05 22:31:45
i'll be buying thickets to my home... even if i had to sell my virginity to afford them.

@_date: 2013-11-11 16:38:46
I'm really scared, the same thing happened last april, and even if we had other traders, in mtgox are some big whales.
@_date: 2013-10-12 05:06:47
