We would love to hear what he thinks about outer space and mining metals. 
Has everyone read up on asteroid 16 Psyche?
 [ 
Peter loves to talk about Gold, and it being rare, would this be something for him to consider?

@_date: 2019-07-15 01:40:51

Do you think lower price would be mass adopted more for users?

More to ask, that as the OP downloads and uses more apps and exchanges, we can offer another option along his path. 
The Exchange is open to the UK.
Currently we do not have an on ramp for the Sterling, but many other good services that apply.
Including crypto to crypto trading services, storage and interest for holding Crypto.  
Education is key. 
Good luck all.

a lot of people would definitely think about it right? 
It could be very much, enjoy the money now rather than wait for technology to catch up. 
Eg using BTC for everything easily. Would people be able to sit on such large amounts of money and wait for the system to change?
@_date: 2019-10-04 03:23:28
This is interesting. I guess quite likely. Get enough to enjoy it in the current system, while waiting to see how the economy and world changes to adapt.

Peter most definitely has an opinion, that he sticks to, like a cheat sheet. 
 [ 
Im sure many of us have watched the debates and information, but indeed Peter has a very clear message and points to repeat, until people listen. 
Aside from Peter, is there anyone else you would recommend for interesting talks?
We did a very simple breakdown on this talk, regarding best quotes and overall opinion on bitcoin and crypto in general.
Gary Smith, was a very interesting person, making some good points. 
Always open to learning more, and suggestion the best talks possible to learn from.

Try listening to two ends of the argument.
Is Bitcoin the Future of Money? Peter Schiff vs. Erik Voorhees
 [  
On July 2, 2018, Reason and The Soho Forum hosted a debate between Erik Voorhees, the CEO of ShapeShift, and Peter Schiff, CEO and chief global strategist of Euro Pacific Capital.  The proposition: "Bitcoin, or a similar form of cryptocurrency, will eventually replace governments' fiat money as the preferred medium of exchange."

This is definitely a little different; Bitcoin, crypto and porn.
 [  
Maybe the coolest little stat;
 *“In 2016 enough porn was watched, that if we took all of the data and stored it on USB drives, the distance would get us to the moon.“—*[ *O*]( quote* 
Good idea to ask people whats new and interesting or different, lots of good material in here!

Read, read and read some more. 
[Medium.com]( is a great place to search for any topic on BTC, or blockchain. 
Starting with the tech (Blockchain), and building your understanding up from there is probably a good start. Think using your PC before opening chrome or your browser. 
There are lots of bitcoin 101 guides -  [ 
Read as many as you can to get a general idea. You will find that after reading a few, it should click for you. 
Finally play around with crpyto, like other users have mentioned, buy 10USD, even 5 USD, download a wallet, sent it, buy things, use it to earn for services.  
Using it will really help you learn about why people are enthusiastic about it.

You had my attention. Now you have my respect.
