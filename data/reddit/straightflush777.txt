It depends if you are talking about a physical server or a VPS...
Physical server: You can virtualize (OpenVZ, Xen, KVM) many server instances and run a store on each of them.
Inside a single VPS : I did not have test this with OB but I'm pretty sure that it is possible to run multiple Docker's containers with a store in each of them.

Have you planned to make any kind of marketing for the average joe around the official launch of OB?

Let's not forget also that Linux dominate the server market and all of the existing super computers worldwide. It also powered critical military equipments, railways, air traffic control systems and a large part of TVs and home appliances sold every day.

I was reading the comments on this article and I was surprised at the proportion of people who are uneducated about bitcoin.
Most people there are thinking bitcoin is a failed concept that will never succeed in the real world. ;)

That looks awesome. :)
Keep up the good work guys!

By they in my first comment ITT, I was refering to the people who are still clueless about bitcoin. It was obvious for me but I just realize with your comment that it is not the case is everyone.

We should not put all the people in the same bag, Right now, it's true that most people don't need it. However, there are already some people who do or simply prefer using it over fiat currency for differents reasons. We should also not forget that each day, there are more ways of using it that are being developed and introduced to the public. Anyway, the adoption and the integration of bitcoin all over the world and the internet is not in decline, it is on the rise.

They don't care or use bitcoin because the technology is too complicated for them at the moment. They don't fully realize what it is or how to use it.
If this app really simplify things for them.....maybe this could bring more users for bitcoin.

So I guess all kind of goods (white, grey and black markets) will be sold on this without any interferences of the governements?

According to [coinmarketcap.com]( the circulating supply at the moment is 16,660,337 BTC. You can probably subtract from that all the BTC that have been lost over the years. I suspect that a large part of this supply will also be hodl for a long time by a lot of people.

Well, it depends of the use case:
* Sending money to someone in a different country. Bitcoin is way faster.
* Sending money to a relative living near you. Fiat (cash or some e-payment options) will be quicker and more simple for most people.

One thing I like very much about OB is pretty much anyone will be able to directly get btc by selling stuff on the platform. This is a big step forward to really start the bitcoin economy in my opinion.  
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:01:29
Competition? no. Counterfeiting? yes.

It's obviously far from being mainstream at the moment but a lot of online cloud business are using it. As a example, Bitcoin is popular with VPN providers for obvious reasons.
Regarding the volatility of bitcoin, most business that are accepting bitcoin are using a service that convert BTC into FIAT automatically. 
Also, as Bitcoin is a permissionless currency, you can donate to a lot of organizations that are banned by Paypal and credit card company like Wikileaks.

More details should be coming soon. In the meantime, you can check some previews of the trading UX/UI in their [twitter feed](

I really like the OpenBazaar project. This could be THE project that really start the bitcoin economy.
I think the team behind it should start a KickStarter campaign to get serious funding and speed up the development even more. I don't know maybe they could offer exclusive promotional items with the logo (t-shirt, cap, mugs, etc) to help finance the campaign.

Probably not in it's current form obviously. However, I will not bet at this point that the developers won't be able to improve their platform and make it a solid alternative to ebay or Amazon in a distant future. It's too early to predict things like that IMO.

That would also be a good start. :)
By the way, I heard rumors that Pokerstar ( online poker room but not currently available in the US) are working to offer a option to withdraw and deposit to their site with bitcoin.
