Will using another wallet recover my funds?

Complete scam. NEVER GOT BITCOINS. Adresses were wrong from the start between Simplex and Bitcoin.com

No. All $1800cad is gone. Simplex gave me and ID that doesn’t match bch or bct. I’ve emailed both complies multiple times. Simplex and bitcoin.com. Simplex says the transactions went through and I got charged but I can’t recover anything in my wallet

Adresses don’t match up. Each company blames each other.  Somebody has my money...

I’m brand new to this Bitcoin. Here is the situation, which I’m sure has been discussed 1 million times. I purchased a substantial amout via credit card through simplex and downloaded the bitcoin.com wallet. 
It’s been almost 3 days and still no transfers to my wallet. I’ve been charged for the coins. 
Feeling really discouraged.  Help please!!!

A guy who has had zero problems with it. Or maybe he is the scammer himself.
