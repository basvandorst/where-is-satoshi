It's like that time Lindsay Lohan was caught with a wrap of cocaine in her pocket and her lawyers said that she borrowed someone else's jeans that night.

And having read a fair amount of the transcripts, I have to agree.
Me too. I'd even go so far as to say that Dratel saw Ulbricht and his family as a tasty pay day and encouraged him to go to trial thinking of the six figure sum rather than what would be right or proper. 
(Which in this case and knowing what was on that laptop would have been pleading out 13 months ago). 
Does Dratel really believe Ulbricht was framed? - *Do any of us*?

it was the neckbeard and Free Ross t-shirt that gave it away :(

damn! bet he's kicking himself ! Other possibles: Maggie with a lollipop in the Simpsons' car was controlling Silk Road all along.

Bah, so many unanswered questions. 
I would love to take Dratel out and get him sloshed and make him admit what really went on behind the scenes...

Hi Thanks for the updates and the AMAs. 
Quick Q: If the jury reach a unanimous verdict and find Ross guilty as opposed to not guilty how long until sentencing? Is it straight away or several weeks or months?

Yes because that would TOTALLY happen... 
I'd go up to Joshua Dratel, esq. after court Friday and say, "Hello Mr. Dratel , you don't know me but I'm fart_knockers from the internet. I demand that you shall become my own IRL reddit style AMA and to ensure it goes well let's get extraordinarily wasted. Here's a tequila.. slam it, then have about 12 more, then we'll head to a beverage establishment and get this thing started."
Are you 12 and in the wrong subreddit or are you from one of those countries that takes everything written literally and doesn't understand things which are said tongue in cheek and meant as humor or sarcasm and other such concepts?
Also as we're discussing internet usernames is the name you picked, "ic_u_got_ur_fist_out" as your username something to do with fisting? You know what they say... what starts with two fingers always ends in five. You should have called yourself 'five_finger_charlie' or 'lube_me_up_scotty'

This is so exciting. You deserve a man like this and you deserve to be happy. Promise you'll share all the deets ;-) xoxo
Yes. 'Can't wait to hear more about this silver fox at the pizza store finding out *exactly* where OP "gets it" and that this sexy chat up line about (bare) "backing it" is the start of a torrid love affair.
