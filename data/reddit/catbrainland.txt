It's difficult to discern that from normal distribution of pattern of orphans. Remember, those minority honest miners will have only miniscule amount of hashpower, given the amount of potential for control now.
With 51% stealthy government cartel, you can selectively censor transactions until it is discovered and miners break off.
Don't parrot the paper. Threat models are in terms of adversarial think given current circumstances, not the ones originally wished for.

Argument for "they have stakes in their reputation to profit as a pool" makes no sense in Bitcoin. These people have no agency over their governments gag orders em to, which mining templates to serve. It's what this issue is all about. Bitcoin was *supposed* to be completely trustless, starting with mining.
For example, if G8 countries decided to *seriously* disrupt bitcoin for several weeks, after all implementation exploits like spamming/DDoS are exhausted, they'd simply go after all pool operators - all at once (you need that to get 51% in either case). They'd block only high value, orders of millions $, provably criminal transactions.
Criminals are much less likely to voice their complains in a timely manner.
No different than interpol bust to "curb terrorism", "take down international pedophile ring" or whatever. I suspect they'd be saving that card for better opportunity, as you can play it pretty much once - after that, everyone is using privately run pools / p2pool.

Luckily for Bitcoin, quantum annealing does not seem suitable to run the modified shor's algorithm to crack secp256k1.
The hardware D-wave produces takes a system of equations and finds a ground state - which seems to be suitable only for certain problems in cryptography, from top off my head SAT attacks on hash functions faster than bruteforce.
The weakest part at the moment seems to be ripemd160 addresses, which could be cracked with 2^80 difficulty on quantum supercomputer (I'm assuming equivalency between Grover's algorithm and SAT). And of course much faster ASIC miners which are potentially millions times more powerful with the same power usage.

Why not? The number of divisible units is  ~2,200,000,000,000,000 in bitcoin
Dollar circulation, converted to cents, is only ~150 trillion cents, and this 2200 trillions satoshi.
It all depends where you move the decimal point for it to make sense at any given exchange rate.
My argument is largely economic one (see gresham's law), technicalities like divisibility seem perfectly sound.

Duh. He's been hiding that he's been running the bitcoin [client] since 2009, not the *project*. Presumably by *hide* he means his hiding of the mining profits from the tax man, as merely running the client nonstop since 2009 would make him filthy rich.
Perfectly clear interpretation of the sentence where he admits to tax evasion (hence the raid) AND to not being satoshi nakamoto.

5 petaflops is barely enough to factor RSA 768 in any reasonable time, the difficulty for DLP (DSA) is about the same (with larger matrix).
For 1024, you need exascale, at least with current GNFS+SNFS techniques.

There are many more pools than those top 10. This is representative democracy. If you don't like a mainstream political parties, vote the underdog - 
Granted, satoshi envisioned direct demoracy (pooled mining was not anticipated), but calling this some sort of cartel is a stretch. Miners vote fast.

My speculation assumes that SAT approach to preimage (which is readily implementable with simulated annealing - and slower on the order of very high magnitudes compared to bruteforce) would be compensated by SAT in general being much faster on an quantum annealing machine.
Code: 
EDIT: There's also of course the route of Grover's algorithm, however I can't say for certain that one would be annealing friendly and/or able to search only the partial preimage (mining difficulty) space instead of full 2^128.

A little infodump here:
 
Wright profile:
 
We call these sorts of guys "cyberclowns".
Meaning, quite weak infosec id cards, and excelling in rather snake oil area (beancounters and forensics; but not much of technical stuff). This amount of boasting is usually a bad sign.
To get some idea: 
My suspicion is that they were both early in the bitcoin game and this is a ploy to direct attention on this little don quijotic duo, for whatever (possibly win-win with satoshi) reason, but YMMV.
Now after poring over their training stuff, I'm a bit conflicted. Kleinman seems to show good degree of technical ability (originally a police officer!) while being much less of a douche. Still not a shred of conclusive proof the guy is even able to write C++ (just as wright), everything just LEA forensics stuff.
EDIT2: By request, here is the Kleiman's forensic training folder  beware that downloading it possibly constitutes piracy, even if it's sourced from dead man's open web folder. Also contains ton of executables, use a VM or something if paranoid.

Partially. Quantum annealing works with N/2 variables of the SAT problem compared to simulated annealing. To solve SHA256, you get quantum system with 2^128 states, with simulated annealing it's 2^256 states.
Currently, finding SHA2 partial preimage ("mining") with heuristic ("simulated") SAT isn't viable compared to brute force. But if there was a way to solve SAT of N/2 variables, instead of N? inb4 D-wave quantum miner ASIC.
Note that this is generalized with cryptographic hashes on quantum computer - in that scenario the "difficulty" to reverse a hash is only half the number of bits - 
@_date: 2015-12-09 06:56:30
I'm inclined towards Kleiman for that reason alone. It would still work with your mail evidence assuming those are not forgery. But out of this funny duo, I can't even confirm either of em is capable of writing a single line of C++, so far they appear as the run off the mill corporate snake oil guys.

Indeed. Or better yet, modify the firmware to ask politely before setting the secure programming flag. A misguided counter argument to not do this is blue pill attack when hardware is in transit between vendor and consumer, but this is rendered moot either by "special unbooted edition" where user is expected to verify result using jtag readout, or more elegant using PKI chain (user gets issued subkey tied to MCU SN, similiar to EFI on PC).

It will not be outright ban, but gradual "difficulties" in using cash. Want to deposit larger cash (or bitcoin) sums to a bank? You better explain to IRS how that cash is not from drug sale (basically the phase we're in now). Because most drugs are sold for cash.


Why would they (whom?) fail?
As long the screws are tightened little by little, so that it's not immediately noticed. The more controversial parts of the implementation will have some easy to understand advantage (cheaper credit cards!) which will "counterweight" the controversy.


Only on surface. While murrica fuck ya style patriotism does help in the US, hard numbers are almost inverse - cash is used far more in european retail than in the US - a lot of european countries overall don't have that "culture of credit card" and it's all debit at best.
US is a decade ahead than anywhere else already when it comes to *technical* cashless society.
 You have to realize there has to be popular "support" to implement this.
For example, there will be popular support for negative interest rate, because it means cheaper interest rates on credit cards. If you're caught using bitcoin, it will ruin your credit score. It all goes hand in hand.
For some fun doomsday porn reading about how credit score is the perfect carrot&amp;stick:

Simply proclaim those are not legit US tender anymore - one of the advantages of having state issued currency.
No different from other currency reforms - these are not new (particularly 2nd and 3rd world countries have some experience with this), it's just that US is a pretty big and unexpected one.
One tidbit Tyler Durden has missed - the proposed doomsday porn scenario of negative interest rates is actually "demurrage". A rather interesting turn of events how to counter the the ever balooning M2 supply.

Read the paper. NaS is difficult to solve as it's a reality warp you can invoke retroactively.
There are mitigations -  - proposes an interesting one, keep the funds locked for substantial amount of time to create a window which can't be NaSed. At the end of the window NaS opens up again, but you can do some tricks - like make the time window lengths random without nothing-up-my-sleeve influence, so keys for purchase at any NaS point won't give overwhelming advantage ever. It's very difficult to tune up/simulate - also this kind of guesswork is frowned upon in proper cryptocurrency engineering as it is emergent property, not an intuitive/obvious one.
Sadly none of the PoS coins currently traded have sufficient market cap to invite full scale key-buying attacks. Just creating such a site could possibly crash value of half of those.

Sure, when money velocity is zero. This applies to all currencies - minus the speculation, they are worthless (or only commodity value in case of base metals) if there is no trade in it.
Here's a suggestion for better argument: Point out that large amount of bitcoin volume is speculation, not trade for tangible goods which lend all money (perceived; not really) tangible value. Essentially noise factor when accounting for real velocity.
It's the same argument as with gold. While it used to have high velocity (value borrowed by summary market of tangible goods traded in it), nowadays it's mostly speculative, with small, separate, demand portion as a base metal. Gold is probably worse off than bitcoin, as in, you can use bitcoin to make more direct purchases than gold, at least online.
Also, may I see your papers, sir? :)
@_date: 2015-04-15 15:58:40


I think our problem here is that I perceive money valuation in terms of market theory of valuation (being a forex trader, you can guess where I am coming from), where as you insist on using intrinsic valuation of money.
Problem with your usage of intrinsic valuation is the intrinsic value is acknowledged by laymen - many of which even believe that 1970 dollar is the same as 2015 dollar - but not by FX traders and bank trading desks. Not even by multinational corporations who are exposed to a lot of exchange risk.
Market valuation dictates inherently subjective valuation by each player - by position in the order book. On grander scale by central bank BR, QEs and coordinated via LIBOR. Yes, there are lot of strings on this puppet show, intrinsic is the resulting appearence for consumer, but the mechanism is still fully market driven - there is no absolute power above us dictating value, there's simply price discovery.
Ever heard of banana dollars? They lost value the second Japan lost the war. What you're proposing with your 'intrinsic value' is that currencies have value regardless of outside factors. That their value simply is. This may've been the case with gold (let's put this can of worms aside), but definitely not paper money.
A lot of references you posted seem interesting, read only few of these in the past. I'll react only on summaries for now:
1) Can you point out the paper which discusses our intrinsic vs market schism in relation to bitcoin? 
2) Everything you posted discusses the bubble factor or even unrelated stuff like mining, which I acknowledge are strong factors at the moment. But mining and speculation is also temporary. They outright ignore or diss the non-speculative trade velocity part as "insignificant" or "non-existent".
Now, if you correlate dark market busts with price ... you probably know what I mean. Unless I'm mistaken no paper even tried to account for negative trade velocity factors on price and put too much focus on purely unpredictable events (though significant and numerous at the moment) - whales buying and dumping.
As for positive factors, I'm of the opinion those are hard to impossible to assess, as it is basically a lot of bag holders trying to trump up the hype plus some small genuine demand for stuff like gambling, drugs or even ransomware.
Too much noise to make anything out of it - so economics academia all seem to make out of ass wild assessments. For example altcoins are far more comparable to penny stocks of 90s - operating timeline in few months; 4 years of bitcoin is more similiar to stocks which survived the .com bust - though struggling, they prevailed some years.
My argument is basically that when all the hype wanes, and we're back on regular S curve, the value wont be zero without a black swan like event of feedback loop =&gt; downward spiral (fluctuating-&gt;less trade because fluctuating - hopefully inertia will prevent that).
My quest is to build an exact model for this use, not pretend trade for goods in bitcoin does not exist when it's conceivably the only factor for bitcoin to be long term viable. If you can point out resources trying to actually model this, I'd be grateful. My personal model indicates that bulk of the volume is indeed shady markets trade (ranging from porn, gambling to guns), so it's somewhat controversial topic and zealous bitcoiners don't want to hear any of it - but at the same time, excellent data can be had every time the feds bust someone.
Sorry for my goalpost moving; you simply seem to read a lot of this stuff, so hoping we can get somewhere specific instead of economic theory arguing :&gt;

This is the most neglected part of bitcoin (and alts derived from its codebase; including DRK). All have fairly chatty networking code which bleeds TMI; treasure trove for statistical taint/correlation analysis.
As for DRK, obviously FBI just needs to "rent" (by buying stake and pumping price) one of the hundred supernodes and simply record samples of the coinjoins/insta consensus. You wont see it all, but small statistical sample is more than enough for succesful wallet decloak given period long enough. Technically it's very similiar to attacks on Tor guard nodes, there are detailed papers out there. This affects bytecoin and Nxt codebases too. Most alts focus on the blockchain protocol while networking stays pretty bare bones.

Full circle back to gold\^Wbitcoin standard for interbank settlements and double ledger for microtransacting, just like past few hundred years with gold backed paper.
Gold is too heavy to carry around. So is to pay on the blockchain. I love bitcoin, but the amount of cheerleading indeed corrupts it's image when giddy kids are confronted with harsh reality (cost of transaction is forever-storage ~500 bytes times number of full nodes. Potentially, couple dozen gigabytes with widespread use. Expensive.)
