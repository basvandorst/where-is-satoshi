But if I am running the script from a server, how would people be able to verify that I am running the code I say I'm running? Couldn't I just update the script at the last minute and take all of the coins, even if the target is not reached?

It's been a source of confusion every time seedcoin are mentioned, you're not alone. I think that it's a serious marketing error but I wouldn't say it's a red flag for me, the startups they have chosen appear sound and after speaking with various people in the Q&amp;As they've run I'm pretty excited about the fund as a whole. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 01:37:23
The source code can be seen by renaming the file to a ".zip" and extracting it. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:45:00
I see what you mean but I'm not sure how that would be easier than just sending the amount you want then send the remaining balance to a new paper wallet. You'd still have to scan the new paper wallet address either way. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 04:15:58
Because the extension contains images and audio files and uploading the whole file to drive required the minimum effort from me.
**EDIT:** I'm not involved in the project in any way btw.

While there are good reasons to mine altcoins I'm not sure this is one of them. As an individual you would mine BTC as part of a pool.

Thanks for the tip! Website works fine on my laptop btw. 
My phone is using Android 4.1.1, I was using the browser in 'Reddit is fun' when it hung.
When I try to open the site in chrome on my phone I get "The site's security certificate is not trusted", interesting.

Check out [zerocoin]( it's a proposed extension to bitcoin that would make it truly anonymous. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:18:47
This page describes the full process but it's quite technical: [
There are services that do it all for you eg:
*  — payments accepted: BTC (Bitcoins)
*  — payments accepted: BTC (Bitcoins)
*  — payments accepted: BTC (Bitcoins), NMC (Namecoins) or LTC (Litecoins)
*  — payments accepted: BTC (Bitcoins)
But you have to trust the registrar just as in the current system.
If you want to do it yourself you basically send 3 kinds of commands to the network using the namecoin software:
1. name_new (preorders the domain, this is the part that costs money)
1. name_firstupdate (allows you to set what the domain should direct to)
1. name_update (updates the expiry time)
I believe that in future updates the updating part will be built into the software. Despite being around for a while there is still a lot of work to be done on namecoin.
EDIT: I think I did a poor job of answering your question. When you update a domain you're just resetting an inbuilt expiry timer that's built into the system.
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:06:05
Donated. When I punched in $5 it made me change it to $5.01 for some reason before I could send it on the site. Strange.
@_date: 2013-10-20 09:48:44
Wouldn't that just mean an even higher demand for miners causing a higher sale price? As long as people are willing to mine at a loss, an individual can't make money mining bitcoins unless they have significantly cheaper electricity costs than average. Even if there was more money to be made (higher transaction fees) there would just be more players.
This is just my opinion though, please correct me if I'm obviously wrong.

Fair enough, I'll do some more research and see if I can put together something with a little more content. 
The system I'm thinking of would be closer to Dropbox, you do not have access to other people's data unless it is made public, the system's primary use would be backing up an encrypted form of your own data to other people's machines.

While I disagree on whether bitcoin will crash soon, you make some valid points.

I have to disagree. I think infographics such as this have role in teaching difficult concepts but are not a replacement for say 'reading the whitepaper'. It was seeing this exact infographic that originally made me want to read the Satoshi's whitepaper in the first place because it helped me understand some difficult concepts and I thought "hey, I kind of get it now, I'll read some more about this".

Just bought my first coins from you guys. When I first tried to withdraw the bitcoin it said I had an 'nsf' error, I assumed that meant 'not sufficient funds' but it that wasn't actually mentioned anywhere. 
I lowered the amount by an approximate fee amount and it sent fine but some more information about needing to leave enough in the account for a fee would be useful. Thanks for the service!

From what I understand, you don't need to pay again. I found a better source actually: [
 does Namecoin work?
The Namecoin software is used to register names and store associated values in the blockchain, a shared database distributed by p2p in a secure way. The software can then be used to query the database and retrieve data.
 much does it cost to register a domain (a.k.a. a name)?
The cost includes a network fee and a transaction fee. The fees are denominated in namecoins (NMC). Initially, the network fee is 50 NMC. The network fee decreases 2x every 2 months. Starting from block 24,000, the decline in network fees will speed up by a factor of 4. You can check the current cost[ here](
(It looks like the current cost is around 0.0627 USD)
 do I obtain namecoins?
You can get them in the usual Bitcoin way, by mining or by obtaining them from someone else, trading.
 gets the network fee?
The network fees are destroyed by the transaction. Nobody gets them.
 gets the transaction fee?
The miners do, just like in Bitcoin. Initially a reasonable transaction fee is either 0.00 or 0.01 NMC. You can choose this based on how fast you want your transaction to be processed.
 long are names good for?
You have to execute an update on a name every 36,000 blocks (approx. ~250 days) or it expires. There are no network fee for updates.
 I have to pay renewal fees?
No, only Bitcoin-like transaction fees, currently 0.00 or 0.01 NMC.
 Namecoin be used to register other data types?
Namecoin can be used to register any other data types. They will all follow the same rules (expire time, data size limit, etc).

My understanding is that the "official hash" is the current longest chain of blocks. Transactions are not added to the blockchain individually as they happen, they are grouped up before the hash is generated.

You're absolutely right, if you like an altcoin for it's values mining it directly will definitely help it out.

You've applied a curve that is designed to show the development of a new technology over time to an *hourly* graph of bitcoin. Surely you can understand why most people think this doesn't apply.
@_date: 2013-11-09 05:21:04
The difficulty is in *getting* bitcoins. Bitcoin was not designed to be easily converted to and from fiat, it is most useful when you're moving coins from one person to another.

* Namecoin is mined in a similar way to bitcoin.
* Domain names are registered by paying a small fee of 0.01 NMC (which is destroyed I believe). After this the person owns the domain, which can only be removed from them if they choose to transfer it.
* Domain names must be updated every 250 days, or they will expire.
* Namecoin is merge mined with Bitcoin, which means that a node can mine for both Namecoin and Bitcoin simultaneously at the same rate that they would mine just one.

@_date: 2013-12-16 04:37:04
What I mean is, if coinwarz suggests that the most 'profitable' coin to mine right now is BTC with specific hardware then wouldn't it be better to mine BTC and then trade for the coin you think will be profitable in the future?
That said, if you're anticipating a sharp increase it may be better to mine the altcoin so you don't accidentally miss out, I'm not sure.
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:43:46
I suppose I was thinking of things that bitcoin is uniquely suited to monetising. Such as non-duplicatable electronic goods?
