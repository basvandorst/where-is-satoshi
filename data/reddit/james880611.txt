Usually all limits mentioned in German tax law are per year for an unmarried person with tax class 1. However after these basics, there are hundreds of exceptions and additional regulations which must be considered too.

Even legal tender is subject to taxes and certain regulations, for instance cross-border traffic and when exceeding cash limits.

I was just talking about the 2nd April when it spiked, after that the upwards trend slowed down significantly and the network behavior went back to normal. What I wanted to say is that, besides the high fees, the network couldn't cope with the 4- to 7-fold trading volume during that period without accepting a delay of up to 2 or 3 days. How should it work with *really* high volumes?

Depends on the person. If CSW would finally pull out the ultimate proof of being Satoshi, the overall effect would be negative. Other scenarios would be better maybe. However everybody would expect him to review all the forks and to solve the current issues, so it's much easier to stay hidden.

You didn't "fix" anything, but you just compared an absolutely exceptional event in the real world with something which happens every other month in the crypto world.

That's the great thing about deflationary currencies: You don't ever eat a single pizza, because it will be worth 50 million dollars some years later.

Most people in trouble would have to sell their crypto in order to pay their bills which require dollars. So there's a lot of selling pressure, because people need their reserves when they get laid off suddenly, and maybe even missing some paychecks because their company went bankrupt.

No. It's very exceptional.

1. The existence of someone else who is willing to pay "anything" for it.
2. Market participants in a new unregulated global market, which is subject to manipulation and scams, and is dominated by unknown people who own most of the bitcoins.
3. Belief, with a religious perspective.

So imagine the Saturday would have been March 30th, and you have to pay USD 100k. You want to use BTC, so you both agree that the equivalent is 24 BTC, to be transferred on Monday April 1st, and you do it as planned. 
On April 2nd, you learn that the 24 BTC you wired now are an equivalent of USD 117k. And 125k today.

This is actually different in other countries, and I agree the US authorities should clarify how to efficiently deal with it.

The so-called fiat currencies don't have intrinsic value, but assets usually have, like a house or the assets of company shares, or gold. Intrinsic value means, there is a value *outside* the financial markets, for instance you can live in a house or make jewelry from gold. The risk of having your fortune in items without intrinsic value is, that due to external circumstances the actual value of it could go to zero, while assets with intrinsic value are very unlikely to lose all their value - at least they should keep their original non-monetary function, like the house which can be used to live in it.

It's a completely irrelevant comparison because millions of new coins are issued each year and there's no limited supply. So what's the point of the article?

For good reasons, the article doesn't mention intrinsic value. Since there's a lot of discussion about it, here is the best definition for it: Intrinsic value means that something is demanded from outside the financial markets. Gold, for instance, has a substantial demand from the jewelry industry which uses it as a raw material for their products.

I would rather suggest that psychologists should do a serious study about how much the "belief in bitcoin" has become a religion: Legendary founders who have disappeared, holy white papers, the immovable belief in the final bliss at some point in the future, communities working like echo chambers for appraisal and motivation, the demonizing of renegades like BCH and BSV believers, important slogans/commandments like the fundamentals are strong and HODL forever, internalized expressions which are immediately shouted against contradictory opinions like FUD, FOMO, filthy fiat, weak hands,...
So the list of obvious resemblances to religion is long. Would surely be an interesting study.
