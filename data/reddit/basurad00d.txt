The attempt of Bitcoin Cash to become the new Bitcoin.

You would tell the exchange "buy me $12,345.78 worth of bitcoins" and then it would buy as much as it could from the people that are selling bitcoins the cheapest.
Basically. there's two ways to do it, at matket price (whoever posts the best offer) or at a set amount (the transaction never happens unless someone is willing to buy or sell at the price you put.)

All indicators? Go to cryptowat.ch, go to GDAX USD/BTC, switch to 1D (one candle for day), go to Overlays and click "Ichimoku Cloud". Scroll to the right...
This will show you the long term tendency of Bitcoin. What do you see? The sell wall has rised slightly. The buy wall has rised more and it's still producing a huge green cloud. Back in August there was a red cloud, which would have caused alarm bells to sound since the long term tendency was downwards, yet 5 months later the coin has tripled in value.
What it means is we're not yet as bad as when the coin dropped from 3000 to 1750 in a month (that's a trend), since we're in a upward trend in general. 
So the worst case scenario is it stabilizes at 12700, but it seems we'll go at least 15k, and once there up since the cloud is green.

I have noticed that the international markets tend to follow GDAX, though. So if GDAX is below the average, the average will go down, and if  GDAX's above the average, the average will go up. So far has been a good predictor of trends.

The price of BTC/USD, for instance, right now:
14500 GDAX
14306 Gemini
13845 Kraken
13290 Bitfinex
13140 Bittrex
It's also weird people can't just arbitrage this.

Well, some guy calls it the "Bearish Golden Cross" and predicted the BTC would fall 25% two days ago:
Supposedly it's when the Support curve crosses the Resistance line, and has nothing to do with BCash pumping, Coinbase inside trading, or some Bitcoin Jesus.

Well, I'm doing this with borrowed money, trying to beat the interest rate, so I guess it's similar...

Maybe a different definition of "daily chart". To me, a daily chart is one that creates a single candle for each day. In this case we're still on uptrend.
If your daily chart is one that covers an entire day, that's like a candle every 3 minutes, completely different thing.

It's easy:
More people want bitcoin, so they buy more, all the people that were selling cheap sold all they have, others wanting to sell see the price rise and sell at a higher price. If the process continues the price will keep rising until the buyers are satisfied.
Fewer people want bitcoin, so they sell more, all the people that were buying cheap spent all their money, others wanting to buy see the price drop and buy at a lower price. If the process continues the price will keep dropping until the sellers are satisfied.
I did this yesterday, as I had money and wanted to buy, instead of buying at market value I set "buy 1/5 of my money when btc is this cheap", and when it was bought I set another 1/5 to a lower amount, and when it was bought I set 1/5 to a lower amount...
So I got more bitcoin and was responsible to stopping it from getting much more cheaper faster by taking some out of circulation.
Of course, had it started going up, the "buy 1/5 of my money when btc is this cheap" would have never happened and I would have never managed to buy, and would have lost that value because my money would have been stuck, so doing it is risky, but buyers and sellers have direct influence on the price of bitcoin.
If your interface allows trading it should be very easy to see how this happens.

I think 10k was the bottom.

Those charts were deleted, as if nothing happened...

Even though I had no money to invest, I managed to short-sell to increase my BTC even further.
When BTC is falling sell high, buy low!

The exchange doesn't sell bitcoin, you buy them directly from users of the exchange that are selling, they will not run out of bitcoin because people doing it for profit would eventually become sellers.

Yes, I see.
I have completely halted daytrading. I was using a strategy that could have made a x4 return on investment for the last 3 days. Unfortunately, the number of transactions required for that with a 1% fee eats all the profits. Wish fees worked differently (say, let me win the x4 first, then I'll gladly pay 50% fee and keep x2 return on investment.)

I see, thanks. It's still hard to count the coins on the wall, though, wish it had a way to increase the aggregation above 10, though there's a clear wall of 315 coins at 12500.

No, daily chart shows we're still in an upward trend (check its Ichimoku Cloud), overall.
The 6 hour chart shows a downward trend, it'd be worrying if the 12 hour and daily one followed suit, but we're not yet  there.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:15:48
Where can one see those walls?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:47:28
It didn't even reach 20k, there was a sell wall that made the ATH only 19.6K.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:14:30
Well, suppose you see regular fluctuations from 16k to 13.5k of bitcoin, so on a regular basis you sell at 16k and buy at 13.5, getting more and more BTC.
Then you sell at 16k and it jumps up to 19k, and 17k becomes the new low, and your money is sitting there at USD and you wait to buy again and the time never comes and eventually you would have won more by hodling than by the trades that increased you BTC initially but now with your money you can't buy as much.
Hodl is like playing in a casino with a broken roullete that you know will eventually give profits, trading is like switching to a roullete that gives better payouts, but is riskier than the first one. The thing is, there will always be lows that BTC will never reach again, the people that traded expecting to make a profit when BTC would bounce at 500, or at 1000, or at 5000, are still waiting, or had to buy less BTC, so only trade if you manage to predict how it's going to move, and when the trend has stabilized and the low will not be hit again, so it's not worth it to sell.
