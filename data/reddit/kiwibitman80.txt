Haven't seen this guy for a while, welcome back!
@_date: 2018-09-21 09:01:23
I feel 7k this weekend is a guarantee
@_date: 2018-09-06 04:27:25
Will he be in there by 30 Sep?
@_date: 2018-09-21 09:01:11
Who would have thought ETF delays would pamp it so much huh
@_date: 2019-03-19 19:33:51
20%? I'm thinking 30% or so?  $3150 to $4050
@_date: 2018-10-28 23:16:54
They would be lucky!  I came in a bit late and got a bit wrecked, but I only invested about 3.5 percent of my net worth.  I want to invest 5% so I have a bit still left in the tank until I am maxed out.
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:22:06
Was there a mt gox coin?
@_date: 2018-10-04 23:04:22
Maybe got somebody else to craft the initial email with lots of prep
@_date: 2018-10-18 21:44:46
Right so the headline says "will use", but in the article it says "may use" without a shred of evidence that this is the case
@_date: 2018-10-29 19:59:13
Love it - where do you buy these ? 
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:21:48
I guess you do a quick sell and go back into tether right?  That's the smart move please reassure me 
@_date: 2018-10-28 23:16:08
Yep - almost every fortnight.  Ironically I am one of those people who is actually waiting for his large tax refund so I can invest more (our tax year is 31 March so different timing to the USA).  Lots of alts but I have my largest holdings in BTC of course.
@_date: 2018-06-28 09:07:48
oh haha!  Yeah that would be our moon day right?  Though if you think about it, they could probably slowly drain it all bit by bit if they were to manipulate the markets enough.  
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:54:13
I was there when that happened.  I panic sold and felt relief when I sold out at USD 400, thinking I was lucky to have cut my losses.  I remember that feeling well enough to now know to keep holding through this crash 
@_date: 2018-06-28 02:10:52
Could this be facebook purchasing BTC ahead of an announcement to intregrate with coinbase???
@_date: 2019-02-20 19:39:20
Its actually slightly easier right, as I assume so many bitcoin have been lost, there might only be 13m or something left?
@_date: 2019-02-19 03:57:15
Hey there - don't forget to claim your bitcoin cash (x2) but be extremely careful with your btc when doing so.  MAYBE worth claiming bitcoin gold as well.  
@_date: 2019-02-19 03:58:38
BTC yes.  OMG unlikely.  
@_date: 2019-02-14 21:28:31
If it is a private ethereum network can it be 51% attacked?
@_date: 2019-04-24 02:49:05
Some people would say that altcoins allow you to trade them and sell them for MORE bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-04-30 00:06:15
I sold in 2013, at a loss, because everybody was saying bitcoin was dead and it was going zero.  But I reckon I would have lost it all on Mt Gox or BTC-E anyway.
@_date: 2019-04-25 20:34:36
Be very careful this is a dangerous time to buy - we are right below a critical support level.
@_date: 2019-04-08 22:49:36
I still don't fully understand mining.  Specifically - I get that each computer is trying to solve a different cryptographic puzzle, and also that this activity secures the network, but I don't understand why the process of trying to solve that puzzle specifically makes the network more secure?
@_date: 2019-04-16 20:17:00
Which gambling platform did it head to - was it Bitmex or Binance?
@_date: 2019-04-30 00:04:55
Here is a snippet of my conversation with an old school acquaintance (now passed) back in 2013.  The comment about BTC-E is pretty funny in hindsight 
H:"well, mat recently bought some software that's supposed to do it automagically"  
H:it's lost him a couple of grand so far, heh  
**11/29/13, 8:24 PM**
Me: I finally got on the bitcoin / litecoin train this week.  Bought in at 960 NZD and switched to a bunch of litecoins which have done well, plus dabbled in a few alt currencies.  Will see how it goes - likely to be a wild ride (although the prices have been remarkably stable today)  
H: Mat is here right now discussing the kncminer Neptune  
H: We just found out we missed out - they're all sold in a day. 1200 x $10,000  
Me: Do you reckon any of the smaller altcoins are worth getting on the wagon for  
Litecoin has been pretty ferocious this week.  I bought in at 24 USD - now 40 USD in just over a day  
Me: Mind you - I had a $400 BTC payment to Bit-E seemingly vanish last night, took me ages to get it back.  Makes you realize how vulnerable you are
@_date: 2018-11-04 21:00:39
With all the inflation etc, I assume that btc has continuous all time high prices when measured against the Bss?
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:08:12
In my country, you only look at your buys and sells in your tax year.  If say, you held BTC long term with no trades, there is no tax loss to claim.
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:57:39
I have a plan.  Wash traded my cold storage btc to claim more tax losses down the track.  10% tether, 40% btc (in a wallet), the rest in decent alts like monero and stellar that are likely to survive.  I have good capital and equity so will watch closely.  Selling a few things I don't need and am giving up drinking, so my cashflow likely to be good.  
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:17:58
Wrong. When it was 19k I think I had 1 btc or something.  I had a lot more btc at 400 bucks
@_date: 2019-01-14 19:38:44
Remember that at least a million, maybe several million BTC are already lost forever
@_date: 2019-01-14 22:59:26
Yes indeed.  Even if you wanted to buy every single bitcoin on an exchange, I reckon you'd be lucky to get 500,000.  Even with OTC orders you might never be able to buy more than a million.
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:10:31
Worst mistake of my life was selling at 400 bucks in 2013
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:50:15
Not if interest rates are low.  I'm 7 figures in debt (mortgages so 4% interest), but I've used that to buy assets (crypto only a small bit mind you) and my gains are substantially more than my debt
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:49:13
Doesnt it need to be like 12k or something by now?
@_date: 2018-07-25 03:25:11
No - but one day when you cash out, you can sweep out all those fork coins 
@_date: 2018-07-25 02:52:58
Yes.  And I think diamond gives you x10 your btc holdings.  Private crashed badly though, but has been gaining a lot lately - its just on a crappy exchange.
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:51:09
No - its a different ETF application - ignore the fud!
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:48:45
Can anybody for the love of god explain to me why the four big btc forks (cash, private, gold, diamond) are all doing so well?
@_date: 2018-07-18 20:55:55
Somebody should make a shitcoin and call it Bitcoin ETF
@_date: 2019-05-08 21:06:35
Do you remember in 2017 at what point the media said "hey this crypto thing is really going up!"
@_date: 2019-05-07 19:12:08
Not just that, but the grin tech (mimblewimble)was given away to a group of people by a mysterious person that showed up on a chatroom / group years ago.  Is this the same person that made the donation, and if so is it... who we think it might be?
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:10:18
Its really ridiculous.  I point out how it is up 120% in 5 months, and they say - oh but its still down from 20k!  As if any crypto person would have gone 100% go in at the exact moment it hit 20k
@_date: 2019-05-03 00:20:37
Matrix, Morpheus?  I know about those coins.  What about Trinity Network and Neo?
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:44:24
No - I think we almost touched 9000 on one of the fake out runs in mid 2018 I think?  Then went all the way down to 6k
@_date: 2019-05-06 20:49:00
Crazy stuff.  I had my BTC wallets from years and years ago - still had the keys and addresses, even with only 3 cents left.  Now he is saying he has lost his addresses, and doesn't even have the transaction ID for the transfer to the blind trust?  And this is in relation to assets worth over a billion?
@_date: 2019-05-08 21:06:01
You mispelt AELF
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:37:59
"Sir when will bitcoin go up?"  "Sir what coins should I buy?"  "Sir what is bitcoin?"
@_date: 2019-05-07 03:55:25
Indeed.  Are there actually any addresses linked to Satoshi?  As far as I know nobody knows this.  You would think people would have spotted multiple large wallets that haven't moved since the early days.  And I have trouble believing that Craig would be happy giving away his private keys and not keeping a back up hidden somewhere.
@_date: 2019-05-22 09:42:01
HA.  Easier than that, just ring up Craig Wright and lodge a compliant and I'm sure he'll be very willing to help you out of the goodness of his heart
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:40:47
Surely it beats the bolivar as well?
@_date: 2019-05-09 22:50:00
Congrats, your latest buy is up 0.50% already!
@_date: 2018-12-16 23:39:46
It does seem suspicious that he bought 100% all in at exactly the ATH, when he easily could have got a mortgage or something and started buying that way 
@_date: 2018-12-20 04:41:26
Yes - but when I say 6k I mean based on current fundamentals - could be a lot more soon!
@_date: 2018-12-16 23:38:39
What did you invest in?  Looks like you are 97.5% down so I imagine some unfortunate trades?
@_date: 2018-12-16 23:40:53
Just wait until we have bitcoin ETFs - then what can they do!
@_date: 2018-12-19 19:49:52
"  All trades are cleared and guaranteed by ICE Clearing US, the central counterparty for all ICE cleared forex futures trades. Trades will result in physically delivered Bitcoin in the regulated Bakkt Warehouse.  "  Saved you a five second google search.
@_date: 2019-05-10 03:17:26
I think it was just a typo when he meant to write SAFE
@_date: 2019-05-03 00:20:08
It does provided your local tax laws give you that tax relief as a cash refund (like in new zealand)
@_date: 2018-12-19 19:52:45
I feel like the true price is still 6k and we had a bitcoin cash related mega dump as large whales (you know who) mega dumped their holdings.  If you don't think it was a manipulated crash, remember that day when the markets were dying and SV was up 23%?  And now look at SV and compare it to ABC.  Those whales have run out of money to FUD the market. 
@_date: 2019-05-07 23:51:48
the binance hack probably won't help.  7000 btc ready to be dumped now
@_date: 2019-05-13 00:16:11
This is right.  Look at that "small" $110 Million buy order that happened at 4.2k.  That by itself was enough to increase price by $1000, and the market cap rocketed billions.
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:43:04
You shouldn't have used the infinite gauntlet and thought about cheap bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:10:26
Ha.  Although last time I saw this in 2018 it did not go well....
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:43:37
6300 on bitmex for a bit - wow
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:35:10
Big boost for Dragonchain - only 98% down now
@_date: 2019-05-08 05:35:08
Well - either that or they are stuck for ever and our bitcoins become permanently more scarce.
