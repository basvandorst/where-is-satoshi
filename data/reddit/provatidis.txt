True. But please understand that its simply impossible to be thrown to a maximum security prison for such offenses (if they are indeed offences, I don't think there is a legal framework for digital currencies but I'm no expert). Worst case scenario you will be charged with a fine. Legal experts please give your input here

To get arrested you must commit a crime worth arresting. I don't wish to be trolled anymore

"Investors should be mindful that losses related to changes in the price of virtual currencies are not protected". That's all. Digital currencies are not regulated yet to my knowledge but please double check. Also I want to point out that bitcoin is the only way for Greeks to pay for services outside Greece currently. And they are really hard to get at this moment

Also they don't just throw people in prison anywhere in Europe. Anyways you are entitled to your opinion, you know democracy

The very concept of your suggestion that someone going to a foreign country will be thrown to a prison is false. Especially for countries like Greece

Not really. It would be nice to see a bitcoin ATM in Thessaloniki

completely agree

I'm afraid what is happening here is much more serious than corrupt politicians using funds to reward political constituencies. None of the political errors made are exclusive to Greece. Its Global. Take a look at this [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_external_debt]( care
