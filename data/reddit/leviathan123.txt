How expensive was to start operating? Did you have to buy any licenses or had a lot of lawyer fees? 
Did you have any VCs starting? If so, how hard was to find them/convince them?
I'm a bitcoin enthusiast from the Caribbean looking to start a bitcoin company in my country but I'm a little intimidated by all the hurdles I have to jump just to get started. Any advice?

Thanks for replying, I have a few more questions if you don't mind. 
Did all of you quit your jobs and worked full time on this from day 1? 
I see that your main business is  you mean you only spend a few thousand in legal fees for a bitcoin exchange? I'm amazed that is so low there. You registered as an money exchanger right?

the site looks awesome! How did you make the rocket icon?
@_date: 2015-04-18 02:25:24
Exactly, looks like OP didn't even look at the date...
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:57:49
are you serious?
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:39:42
relax, this is not a crash, just some people selling. take it seriously if it falls under $50

Welcome to the club. $20 in a single day because the Europeans are scared? Come one, this is insane! 
@_date: 2013-03-21 18:59:12
No no no,  the problem is not the Europeans, I´m sure a lot of them decided to buy bitcoins when they heard about Cyprus, the thing is that everyone is saying THIS is the main reason of the rise, its not. 
If truly so many European individuals have decided to buy in AFTER the Cyprus news, we´re assuming they didn´t have accounts ready and had to register, verify and transfer money. Are you telling me they did this in just what, 5-7 days?
And even if most of these Europeans already had accounts, how come we haven´t seen sites crashing because of the buying frenzy? This rise seems too calculated. Too expected.

How's your writing? Do you draw? Do you know more than 1 language? Anything can work. Also, how old are you?

@_date: 2013-04-03 23:46:38
I have tried them and they're good. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:02:18

@_date: 2013-04-14 18:19:47
here you go 
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:25:47
and reading all of your desperate/ecstatic comments on every low/high... 
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:58:29
let the short term investors and the weak of heart get out, im in this for the long run, this dip is just temporary. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:16:50
Dont waste your time on those sites, try offering services for bitcoins, that would be a faster way. What can you do?
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:05:22
where did you see this message?
@_date: 2013-04-25 05:30:13
cool :)
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:53:43
exactly, that would mean that a lot of people would be dumping their BTC, now what would they? the thing is deflationary, the value is supposed to go up, unless of course, they lost faith in it...

Could you add the option to set the Bought At in Bitcoins? I dont remember at what USD price I bought my PPCoins and Litecoins... I just exchanged them.
