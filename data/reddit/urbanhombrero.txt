Every investment is a binary investment.  You will either make money or lose money (OK you could break even).  Bitcoins are no different than the stock you put you're money in.  It could go down in which case you can hold it until it either goes up,  goes to zero or just hovers down from when you bought it.

What are you even talking about?  When did I say this discussion was a recommendation that everyone should do it?  And when did I say or even imply that private individuals are being bailed out?  
My argument is that people should not follow in the steps of the scumbags on Wall Street and try to cheat the system.  Sorry if you can't follow logic.  
Carry on, True Bitcoin Believer!  I'll bail at the right time and take your money with me.

So the banks acting on a moral hazard means we should all do it? I like your logic. Fuck it all. If you can't beat them, join them. Let's flush it all down the toilet.
Do you sell used cars by chance?

Go look up what the word implied means.  I can't argue with someone who doesn't understand language.

That's like saying I wouldn't put my money in an interest bearing account because the banks and the Feds are corrupt.  I have to live within the confines of the system to survive. I don't have to join the dark side because everyone else is doing it. 
You may be helping my bottom line now, while bitcoin are on the way up. But if it crashes, me and everyone else that plays by the rules will be covering the cost for your lack of integrity.

Great, file for bankruptcy so the rest of us can cover your ill conceived risk assessment.  OP, have you ever had an IQ test? I'm betting you're on the left.

I don't care what he does with his borrowed money except for the fact that he'll be relying on the taxpayer to bail him and his family out (in the form of social services) should it blow up in his face.  If that's something you can't understand then there's nothing else to discuss.

And going about it in a stupendously stupid fashion.

You mean like the future?  Yeah OK.

You stated you have good credit and will pay your debts back. I don't consider that a scumbag move.  The OP is a douche and deserves to lose everything he has.
As someone else in this thread mentioned, even if this guy makes a fortune on bitcoins, he'll eventually lose it anyway because of his mindset, which is that of a loser.

You implied it by suggesting it is the banks fault this guy is borrowing money to bet on bitcoin.  In case you haven't noticed, banks aren't handing out money willy nilly anymore. Which means this guy had to have good enough credit to get the money in the first place. 
So no, you haven't pointed out an error in my logic and it's not a straw man argument. But nice try using the strawman as a strawman.  


So you're suggesting that if this guy declares bankruptcy by losing everything, he won't be looking to the government for a hand out for his him and his family?  Maybe not but I sincerely doubt it.

By gambling recklessly instead of investing across a wide spectrum assets with differing levels of risk.  A lousy plan IMO.

I suggest working on breaking the chains of your own ego that makes you feel bad about yourself.  Look in to Zen meditation and koan work.  It helps get your mind off of the everyday bullshit we all deal with.  
I've used it to great benefit during really dark periods of my life and continue to do so, albeit sporadically at this point. It really makes a difference, if for no other reason than it preoccupies your mind with a puzzle that really can't be solved with the intellect.  It's wonderfully distracting, is a form of mental and spiritual purification and keeps you from focusing on the negative. Good luck and let me know if you have any questions. (not that I'm an expert).

I hope you're a troll.

It doesn't work that way any more. Only the big guys get to wipe the slate clean. The poor suckers at the bottom are still on the hook for the debt they ran up.
@_date: 2013-03-15 01:42:38
But on the backside, every dollar you've borrowed, should bitcoin crash, is money that someone else, not you, will need to make up. 
I'm working off the premise that the money I've invested in bitcoin is money I can afford to lose. It's easy to say that everyone else is cheating so why shouldn't I.  Integrity is the difference between becoming one of them and maintaining your character in the face of injustice and adversity.  
TL;DR I'm risking my own money. You're risking other people's money. Just go work for Goldman Gambling Sachs already, scumbag.

So I'll have to bail out your sorry, irresponsible ass just like I had to bail out GS? 
You're a douchebag and even though I own bitcoins, part of me hopes it goes to zero just so you're left holding a bag full of nothing.

So if I have stock in HSBC and profit from it and then find out they were laundering drug money, I'm then a hypocrite? Nope.  I'm only a hypocrite if I continue to buy or hold their stock once that information is made public.  


You are back-pedalling on your initial stance.  Now you're saying you're going to pay back your debt.  That's entirely different as you are not deliberately going into debt with no thought of repayment like the OP.  I'm only calling out those people who borrow money with the intention of saying fuck the debt if their investments go south. Somebody has to pay for these fuckheads.
I have no way of knowing how many people have leveraged their retirement or borrowed money to invest in bitcoins. I can only assume those cases are the outliers.  Personally I can afford to invest in bitcoins, so I do. And I can afford to lose all I've invested.   
@_date: 2013-03-15 01:09:45
I agree with your assessment completely, but at the end of the day are you comfortable becoming one of "them"?  Personally, I'd rather be poor and have integrity than be a rich scumbag. Which is why I'll probably never be wealthy.
