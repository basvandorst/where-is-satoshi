The client had been updated to drop fees to less than 0.02ltc but they pocketed tons from trades.


0.5 LTC was Ridiculous for most enthusiasts who attempted to hold litecoin, the effect there actions had on the economy was devastating. As an exchange with the number 1 trading volume of litecoin, they should have been more helpful with litecoin but instead promoted feathercoin buys by charging less fees for withdrawal.
Say you just heard about Litecoin during the Gox march-april when the prices just started to soar, As an enthusiast One or More of these would have most likely happened once you join btc-e to purchase litecoin:
1. Signup to BTC-E
2. Deposit Bitcoin/USD
3. Purchase 1-10 Litecoin, they where around 1-6$ anyway.
4. Attempt to withdraw Litecoin which you just purchased, Visit withdrawal page, Only after you click Withdrawal button to fill in the litecoin address details + amount, You notice it says * Min amount for withdrawal - 1 LTC.* and *Fee for withdrawal is 0.5 LTC.*
5. Sell the litecoin back for bitcoin and withdraw less bitcoin than initially deposited, thanks to the withdrawal fees. OR buy Feathercoin/Novacoin, one of the coins which BTC-e is known to have been bribed to put into the exchange BUT they have 50x less withdrawal fees. Support BTC-e to sell the Litecoin they obtained with the fee's they collect and halt growth in litecoins economy.

People who purchased illicit items didn't mind paying a premium for there Bitcoin, Unlike other competitive legit markets.
Thanks to this, a lot of capita were funded into bitcoin by users who didn't mind paying the Ask price for Bitcoins so they can order their Weed for example on Wednesday for it to arrive on a working day of the same Week.
Some sellers even priced their items in Bitcoins with Silkroad, not hedged in USD nor any other currency.
I won't go into much detail, but without either of the markets, Bitcoin wouldn't have grown at this rate IMHPO.

Good way of hunting these extensions (if you have some intermediate JS and html knowledge) is:
1. Visit 
2. Download the extension using a service such as 
3. Rename the filetype from .crx to .zip
4. Look inside .js files for unusual code, look at external sources for javascript, can also check "  "permissions": " inside the file manifest.json to check which websites have code execution permissions. 
5. Click on "Details" tab when the extension description pop's up and click "Report Abuse", also inform the community with the report link while they can manually disable the extension if they have it installed.

The market cap can easily be moved into Bitcoins, these are all temporary Capita if you wish to look at it that way.
Most of these alt coins cannot be directly exchanged to FIAT, they have to be exchanged into Bitcoin, They are also valued at Satoshi's. People who use these coins judge there Bitcoin value not USD value, does this not make you grasp the concept at all?
If Bitcoin proves itself worthy enough, it won't be hard for some, if not Most of the whole crypto currency index, to move to Bitcoin in short amount of time. Any money invested in alt coins can easily be transferred into Bitcoin and the value of Bitcoin is not lost. People are even mining these alt coins in exchange for Bitcoin using services such as  and manufacturers of ASIC's are starting to see real competition to distribute there hardware quicker into the market otherwise consumers will resort to switching to GPU mineable coins.
Like i said, we are relying less on FIAT just by having alt crypto currencies if you look at it that way. Before, we could only exchange FIAT/BTC.

While agree that if Bitcoin is overtaken by any other Alt-Coin, There will permanent trust lost in crypto currency in general.
Having a single coin is centralization. Alt coins are like live test nets, play grounds, and have much more benefits to Bitcoin.
For example, Litecoin's development is also contributing to Bitcoin's, With plenty of people gaining interest in developing alt coins for fun or profit, they study Bitcoin's source code and we also end up having more developers submitting data.
Pool software is improving, the infrastructure is also improving, everything is becoming more decentralized, We hardly rely on FIAT anymore, before it was either exchange the bitcoin to fiat or exchange the fiat to bitcoin, but now we can temporarily move our assets into an alt crypto currency and move it back to bitcoin with ease and not relying on fiat currency.
The most important is that crypto currency is more decentralized, we don't have to rely on Bitcoin's success, competition is also good for bitcoin community to step up there game. Dogecoin also brought loads of crypto enthusiasts into the scene along with Litecoin, now it's a game of thrones situation to see which coin will win over the most users and become the most stable, it will be a wild ride for sure, the winter is coming.

I trust Agora to a certain extent so i'm playing the devils advocate here;
When marketplaces usually allow people to withdraw coins before they pull an exit scam, they do so to push through *legitimate* withdrawals along with their own. This is so the transactions get mixed up and it's harder to trade who the stolen bitcoins go to.

All that i am getting out of this is my fun, I could have made so much money in the past few days if i brought some Litecoins but i didn't buy more than 10, i gambled my Bitcoins on satoshidice so i didn't have enough money to adopt litecoin.
The most profit i have had from this is watching spoil t users who don't want any threats to there Bitcoin investments shit them selves when they see another currency which uses the same technique to grow do it without a problem.
I have no hate for Bitcoin, nor am i jealous of anyone for having this or that. I just like diversity and watching stuff change. Maybe i am fucked up but whatever.

"Confessions of Mt.Gox/BTC-e admins." most probably.
As long as Silkroad is Running, Bitcoin's value can be easily manipulated.
Reason? When someone wants to buy something from Silkroad, they just buy Bitcoins at whatever the price it is offered, they don't care about the value, Silkroad then auto hedges the funds into USD for the seller if the seller selected it so there is always another seller at the top price.
Silkroad users never mind paying an extra couple cents, end of the day they have money to purchase goods and are not investors but big time consumers everybody wins.
For those who say Silkroad isn't used much by Bitcoin users, Please know that has more than half the number of subscribers on Reddit than @_date: 2013-03-20 05:12:46

Because BTC-E is the biggest setback to Litecoins Success.
Imagine having to pay 0.5 LTC to withdraw coins you purchase,
Most people who want to hold on to Litecoin, even just a few come there and purchase Litecoin. Once they attempt to Withdraw there coin, They get hit with a surprise which is half a Litecoin for the withdrawal.
Vast majority sell litecoins back and either withdraw there coins or buy an alt coin which has 150x lower fee's for withdrawal when comparing to Bitcoin Value.
This is a tactic BTC-E is using to take advantage of there status as a Litecoin Exchange which has the vast majority of Users.
Things are chaging though, users are moving to alternative exchanges and Litecoin is back on it's way to recovering from its biggest setback. But as long as BTC-E holds there title, Litecoin will suffer a huge setback from its capita growth potential/target as they are losing potential investors.
Hopefully MtGox add's Litecoin soon, People don't just hope to tap into some of Bitcoin's Users but mainly they hope to have a more reputable exchange which has most the trade volume and better turnkey merchant options.
**tldr;** BTC-E owners are scam artists which impose scary fee's which drive litecoin investors away.

They are talking about ASIC's, The machines which have been promised since early last year and they haven't received one of.
For all we know BFLabs can be behind all the difficulty rise.
For all we know BFLabs have so much power with them right now they could be doing an attack on the network, collecting as much BTC as they can.
They could be using these machines as long as possible, 1 is enough to outnumber many miners so isn't it possible there is an attack on BTC already? Every week that they say "next week" tons of bitcoins will be in there hands.

Faster Transactions, 
Not being vulnerable to ASIC hardware is one of the best features, 
Not just because people who have had there mining rig's become obsolete because of ASICs have other places to go and put there hard ware to use, 
But because ASIC's have been proven to be a threat to the Bitcoin Currency, 
Has been monopolized by large companies which keep hardware as long as possible, possibly making an attack on the Bitcoin Network such as a 51% Attack although i am not implying this.
This user  also explain why Litecoin is More Secure than Bitcoin.
Hey i see you are a Loyal Bitcoin user, i'm not trying to put out your flame here but You of all people should know Bitcoin need's other Currency's to co exist with, it creates diversity, stability and Crypto Currency does not need to be represented by a single Currency such as The USD needs Euro and GBP.
Also Litecoin has been very stable for the past few weeks, Although it jumped from 0.10 USD to 5+ USD within a month, it is currently stable at around $2.50 and has been so for over a few weeks People could have mined Litecoin and exchanged it to Bitcoin such as they do with Any other crypto currency which loses its Profitability Ratio when comparing against Bitcoin but Litecoin has always been more profitable to mine than Bitcoin recently without losing it's reputation.
Our community over at has nearly 1000 active users.
Out Community over at has over 3,000 Active users, 2,000 of them subscribed in the past 2+ Weeks and our discussions are nearly never based on the LTC/USD value, we don't spend every hour of the day trying to pump up the value, we are focusing on other things.
I haven't come here to argue, i mentioned Litecoin being better in terms of technology, i'm not here to argue about it being "another fork" of Bitcoin either, giving my 2 cents when a user mentioned there are no alt currency which are popular/stable and provided my source of what influenced my opion for it to be better technical wise.

Nothing wrong with buying Litecoin, if you purchased some 2 weeks ago you would have made more profit than with bitcoin if you sold right now.
Not saying people should ditch Bitcoin, why not diversify your investments? There are tons of non crypto currency, there is plenty of room for crypto currencys.
It makes it easier to launder your money when purchasing from silkroad etc too when inter exchanging currency's. there is countless number of uses for multiple currency.
Also all the people who invested money into graphics cards can continue putting use to there hardware when there current one become obs elite once the asics step in.

A few years back some fucker forwarded all my incoming emails to him, setup some other port forwards which had important mail go to spam and trash and he had a copy of everything.
Took my domains, and i noticed they where transferred after 3 months so i couldn't even get them back from my registrar and icann complaints didn't get a response.

Many Reasons, A few of them Being:
* Faster Confirmation times for Transactions
* The value of Litecoin is gaining, currently reaching 2 usd per litecoin (start of last month was around 0.10 usd)
* A Silkroad type Market place accepts Litecoin as the Only Currency (Atlantis)
* Many new services based on Litecoin are popping
* GPU Miners make more profit mining Litecoin than with Bitcoin right now
* When ASICS come in, guess what most of Bitcoin users will do with there Hardware? Guess what some of them will also be using?
* There are 100's of currencies globally the strongest ones are USD, GBP etc and the low ones are Zimbabween Dollars etc.
 But until now there had only been 1 Large Crypto Currency such as Bitcoin but the others where very low in value and circulated.
Diversity is what The crypto currency economy needs, there is also a limitless list of reasons for that too.
The list is endless bro.

Traders (the circlejerkers here) downvote all the posts which are irrelevant to bitcoin's value increase, create more demand pump up the price on mtgox.
And all of it is artificial, iv done stock trading i know how small orders being pumped in work, this shit is evil, lots of innocent people are investin money in bitcoin when the value is not what it seems.
you did mention my point though, bitcoin needs a stable price, i hope it comes to that one day.
@_date: 2013-04-30 17:53:25

Says some people who use MTGOX (which currently trades 80% of all Bitcoin Transactions).
This is the same speculation Bitcoin received don't forget, just because an anonymous marketplace isn't up yet and not many places accept it, its a matter of time before sellers on SR start accepting LTC and then a competitor to SR opens up which accepts LTC if they don't.
then you see people who accept BTC starting to Accept LTC Too...

You could have made a more "friendly" post though, in terms of a tldr, friendly approach and all as they are already criticizing litecoin users of "spamming litecoin" all over the board although i don't back up the claim some posts are doing so and posts like this don't stand out between them ones.

What's with the down votes though, I said they don't need to feel as generous thinking they created these releases such as put work into encoding them ripping them and everything, they just uploaded a torrent file.

"MT Gox twitter event" happened way after Litecoin passed 1-2 USD. 
Litecoin held up very well against Bitcoin (LTC/BTC)
When Bitcoin dropped to ~60-50$ from $250, Litecoin dropped nearly to 1$ from 5 USD but gained value back quicker than Bitcoin.
The Arbitrage between BTC/LTC Caused LTC/USD to Fall And it was because BTC's Value fell not Because of Any Litecoin Bubble.
(Litecoin's USD Value is Proportional to Bitcoins USD Value as BTC/LCT Is stable.).

They cannot learn a lesson when the main Bitcoin community is being manipulated.
@_date: 2013-08-19 10:02:33
Litecoin is Bitcoins safest alternative. 
The network hashrate is strong, It is more Diverse, Anyone can start mining right away without pre ordering or buying hardware which can't compete fairly with other miners.
This is essential in a *decentralized* currency, One which you hardly describe right now without a biased opinion.
Like it or not, once Litecoin hit's MtGox, sure people will sell, Sure more GPU miners from Bitcoin will come to Litecoin but a majority (unpredictable but based on the history of current events) Most will hold some Litecoin and if anything they won't mine it to trade in exchange for Bitcoin as more Merchants will accept Litecoin along with Bitcoin and as a Faster, Secure coin with Active and Skilled developers it has ALOT of potential.
Also you should know Litecoin hasn't used 1% of the cards Bitcoin has used.

There is already atlantis, blackarketreloaded and maybe more to replace it.
*But the value of Bitcoin will stabilize as not many users will be "paying the extra dime above the market price".*
i.e. A person wants to order an ounce of weed from Silkroad for 400$
The ask price is sitting at 140.54$ for 1 bitcoin
The Bid is sitting at 140.30$ for 1 bitcoin
He could place a bid and wait for someone to accept it, which is bound to happen but he just goes and pays the extra 0.24$ for the bitcoin without it bothering him much As he wants to order his ounce as soon as possible so the vendor dispatch the order the current/following working day.
The volume of users which buy bitcoins at above the market price like this mostly comes from the silkroad.
So we could see a fall in the value maybe dramatically or maybe gradually, possibly temporarily though until another market emerges or silkroad recovers.
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:21:16
4-6$ was the of litecoin, it adjusted since then.
The value couldn't be sustained practically anyway as many factors where getting in the way.
For example:
BTC-E, The Litecoin Exchange with the most Volume decided to impost 0.5LTC Withdrawal fees, Either users had to caugh up 2-3$ worth to withdraw Litecoin there purchased or they had to sell there litecoin back. Many had to sell.
Also The fee's in the client itself where decided when litecoins market value was much lower, this made Litecoin transfers very expensive, they where over 0.1ltc.
Now that both the problems have been resolved, BTC-E withdrawals are 0.1ltc, Transaction fees arenow 0.02ltc and getting lower, Litecoin is set to grow without many obstacles and has been stable at 2$ for quiet some time now.
@_date: 2013-03-11 20:32:04
Averaging 10-15 minutes to confirm transactions these days.
I am no EXPERT, however i have noticed many complains about the confirmation time and every minute counts, a 400% increase in speed matters ALOT And i will stop talking about any benefits before you end up focusing on my comment flaws.
What i want to ask is why you would like to keep the main crypt o currency in use as Bitcoin? Why do you mind an upgraded version coming along, not implying this one is, it is far from perfect but in a few generations of crypt o currency s Bitcoin will stand out as being one of the least convenient to use in my honest opinion.
It is very easy to change currency's without losing money.

You are entitled to your opinion You can choose to support a coin that has had 100,000's of coins stolen by hackers which are becoming multi Millionaire's off there jackpots (Yes i am talking About Bitcoin, There have also been Bitcoin Botnet's too) but point out something such as this about Litecoin.
Not here to discuss Ethics too, i see you have your ones set the way you want it.
Uf course i am pointing out Faster Confirmations, They are also Secure enough too. Which is very important right now, especially large marketplaces need faster confirmations and there are Silkroad alternatives (which use Litecoin &amp; Bitcoin together whereas most of the users pay with Litecoin. A matter of time before Silkroad also accepts Litecoin along with Bitcoin once MtGox finish's integrating Litecoin.

create tons of purchases from your website pay yourself in bitcoin, sell food for example, less tax on food sometimes even no tax.
You will pay some fees to Bitpay but apart from that there are many good money laundering methods you need to be more creative bro.
Open up a localbitcoins.com account, sell bitcoins for cash!
Plenty of users will buy from you.
You can also tip me if you have too many bitcoins and my idea helped you ;)

Crypsty once gave me 5 LTC for pointing out a security hole that enabled users to bypass 2 factor authentication,
was only worth 10$ or something at the time, 
although its worth 150$ now they don't seem to be very generous with rewards.
