Well, I would say the disadvantage would be being late to the party. For example with Eth, there are already so many good devs working on projects using smart contracts. Bitcoin will be well behind the curve

I'll sell you all mine for 15k

Not Sure, it was probably really good for someone.

Use a cell phone for ID verification. Pics work better than computer webcam. Mine wouldn't work from PC, but worked fine from cell phone browser

Hmmm a wallet is not a bank account, and if they ask I would show them. I think we are clear, but risky wording in the future

Will the real Satoshi, please stand up

Where is your data coming from? Or are you making it up? The 95% 5% part. Doesn't seem like a very realistic statistic for me, I was just wanting to see the source If it is.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:13:15
Ok haha now my response makes me look like an ass hole. I thought you were just another naysayer talking about invisible money

I wish Roger would disappear. His face and poor attitude shine to brightly in the early days of cryptos.

Congrats! I'm sure that's the best heart attack you will every have! Get them bad boys on a hardware wallet. If you have that many, maybe fund a short vacation :)
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:19:18
Ahh okay I'm going to think on it, I sure could use a half a bitcoin right now haha. Wish I had it in front of me so I could try to force it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:29:34
And that people use tether to buy BTC like crazy when It dipped to 14k lol
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:38:15
Get outtttttta here. I could buy and hodl w that money. I don't need to wear a shirt for that.

Odd to me that at the time it was thrown away it was a million dollar hard drive, and he "forgot" about it. Even if wealthy, a million bucks isn't something to really forget about.

I'm not so sure I agree with you. Bitcoin is not opposite of socialism. And I would think most people who believe in socialism to a point are just looking for an alternative to our failing government and fiat currencies.  Something like block chain has never existed in the past so has never been a viable option or belief, maybe those who think they supported socialism have now found that crypto may solve the issues that drew them to socialism in the first place. When it comes to political values, I have pretty moderate views, but always seemed to align more with candidates on the left, but after educating myself on block chain tech, I believe it is revolutionary to the next step in human evolution. I think block chain adds an alternative to current politics and it will be very interesting to see where it goes. I believe it may be the most powerful technology to date, and could either make us or break us as a society depending how things go.

Adds bitcoin wallet address to sob story. Bro a lot of us have hard times financially, doesn't mean anyone else should bail us out of it.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:42:09
What about this story is impossible that would make any readers on reddit laugh along with you?
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:48:33
I love to hodl it down ��. And to get rid of the whole trusted 3rd party system in EVERYTHING.

I would just like to say thank you to the OP. In all the excitement and crazy, it's easy to get caught in the trees. Props to you for using your gains to make an even bigger difference in the world. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:52:23
I like this; I think this is the case for a lot of people. Block chain is revolutionary, and not the easiest to grasp. But participation in it seems to have a great effect on better educating noobs on currencies and markets all around.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:29:43
I dont think it sounds like that...
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:18:24
Just noticed that they have a limited service interruption on their site. It is for ID verification. As soon as that gets fixed try again and you should be good!
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:57:58
So, legal question for anyone who may have an answer. According to Bitfinex TOS, they are not liable if you get no cash for your Tether. SO, say that I use Binance and not bitfinex, the tether bomb explodes because of ifinex shady dealings and I lose all tether value. Then would it be possible for a class action against bitfinex since it was their wrong doing and I didn't agree to their TOS? 
Spoiler- I do not use USDT at all because to me it seems like playing hot potato. But if this is the case, might as well play out all future possibilities.

Need to back dogecoin with doges. 1 dogecoin = 1 doge
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:39:20
I've thought the same. If only we could direct the computing power to do something amazing, or what if Bitcoin was created by NSA just for harvesting computer power? ��
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:59:50
Jesus bro get your coin address off the post. Learn a skill and get out of your labor job, but have some pride while you do it son!
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:56:20
Interested to responses to this. It amazes me ON Reddit how little credit goes to the elite bankers. They will infiltrate Bitcoin if they think it will damage their pockets. And these groups are not dumb, and won't be easy to spot.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:12:16
Okay Chad. Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:04:25
I could help you if you would like to send me a message. Don't hand any keys out with your seed words publicly, or privately to someone not trusted as they can access your wallet as well.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:28:52
Should've used dogecoin
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:04:42
Yeah, don t trust the guy that tells you to not hand your info out...Idc if he trusts me or not; hope he takes my advice

Ether with smart contracts :)

That did it for Me, hope it works for you as well!
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:30:16
I don't know, easy way to communicate without being on the thread? Privacy? Maybe so I could woo him into splitting his fortunes with my basic white girl alter ego? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:03:22
Wait, why are you here? No-one here cares whether you believe in it or not. Carry on about your business as usual and come back and read your post in a few years.

My girlfriend and I have just adopted a 14 year old girl from her foster home (we are only in our 20s) and want to take her on a trip somewhere to celebrate, but of course we are broke, because - capitalism. :)
