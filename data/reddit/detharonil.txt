If anyone really wants to stop propping them up, they'll use software like Popcorn Time to hamstring Hollywood's reliance on copyright law and phony IP to make money from artificial scarcity.  Independent media only makes money when the playing field is leveled, and the best way to do that is to allow them to do what they do best: change their business models as the old one crumbles while the big studios shuffle about and legislate instead of innovating.
Donate to the creators all you like, but things like this have a real effect on the major studios' revenue when they become friendly enough for the average user.

I mentioned the fact that people in rural neighborhoods left their homes to work in cities because the industrial revolution spurred that movement.  They left voluntarily because, before protectionist policies were put in place, working in the city was far better than the lives they left in the agrarian sector.
You conflated things that did happen which things that necessarily happened when you pinned responsibility for progress in humanity's health, wealth, and overall well-being on the state.  When you blindly spout that one of the things which benefitted humanity was "undoubtedly regulation," you are making unsubstantiated claims and shifting the burden of proof.  If you recall, you first said that regulation is necessary; I simply asked for a clarification in the beginning.
I conflate bad regulations with all regulations because they are all enforced with the barrel of a gun.
Oh, and requiring people to pay union dues is forcing membership.  Making a few quips about right to work states doesn't change that.  I happen to live in a right to work state, and my brother works in a union shop.  He is not required to pay dues, and he does not.  He doesn't like that the dues go overwhelmingly to campaign contributions of corrupt politicians.

Don't take statist as an insult.  It's just a preference, like masochism.  Wear it with pride.
The fact that something happens and whether it happens legally are two very different things.  It's true that states are overturned.  However, they are typically replaced with another state.  The state is simply a verbal abstraction for a group of people who coerce everyone in a given area by stealing in the form of taxes, making rules which everyone must follow, and enforcing those rules with the threat of theft, imprisonment, or death.
Wall Street exists because of the United States government.  Banks exist in their current form because the USD is the only legal tender, as per the government.  Taxes must be paid in USD.  Competing currencies are met with the threat of illegalization or regulation, forcing people to operate in a way sanctioned by the government or not at all.
You're also misunderstanding force.  By force I mean coercion.  As in, forcing someone to do something or face the consequences.  It is indeed possible for one person to force another to do something.  However, the state and its lackies or those of enough wealth and/or influence to alter campaign results are the only ones who may exert coercive force without backlash from the state.  That's what I mean by monopoly.  If those who comprised the state were literally the only ones who coerced anyone, then the issue of evil in humanity would certainly be more black-and-white.
I don't particularly like Wall Street.  I don't like any group of individuals who take advantage of government intrusion in our lives to profit.  However, I dislike the government intrusion even less, because it's quite a bit more difficult to escape.  One needn't invest on the stock market or own USD to feel the cold steel of a policeman's gun on one's neck.  One need only ingest the wrong material or start the wrong sort of business.
The state affects us all negatively.  The fact that you enjoy it doesn't make it good.

@_date: 2014-02-07 18:50:49
The point is the method by which the power is exercised.  The state has a monopoly on force, making it the most apparent and persistent violator of individuals' liberty.  The state is also granted a sense of legitimacy because of statists such as yourself, so people also complain less when those who comprise it murder, imprison, or steal from millions of people.
Power only has meaning in the context of coercion.  Coercion, while possible by those not a part of the state, is perpetrated most often and most consistently by those who comprise the state.

@_date: 2014-02-07 00:55:02
First of all, I've nothing against voluntary unionisation.  The problem arises when the state decides to require membership in certain industries and the like.
Second of all, you're conflating actions that did occur with actions taken out of necessity.  People moved from rural locations to work in cities because they preferred it, believe it or not.  The regulations came later.
This still doesn't come to the root of the issue, though.  Compliance with regulation comes through the barrel of a gun.  The fact that you get some benefit as a side effect does not justify anything.

Who determines necessity or overreach?  Is it all relative, or is it all ok until it inconveniences you?  The cold steel of state power always grows beyond control because it is the nature of violent thugs to extend their influence.
The institution itself is flawed because it is rooted in violence and coercion.  There is no safe or acceptable government because there is no safe or acceptable theft or slaughter of human beings.  Just because the perpetrator has a badge or won some phony election doesn't make it just.

In any case, you're probably right.  I'll admit to trusting software I really shouldn't have in the past (looking at you, Bitmessage).  Still, I'll continue to prefer open source software and avoid closed source when possible, if only because it says something when devs feel confident enough about their software to work out in the open.
@_date: 2015-01-30 12:55:03
Wrong.  They can relicense it completely due to total control over the copyright (as the two non-SL contributors also agreed to the license change).  Every previous release is legally still distributable via the LGPLv3, but only by others who downloaded the code and choose to distribute it as such.  The commit history change was just a laughably childish attempt to prevent that from easily occurring.
Side note, copyright is a minefield.  Do away with the entire idiotic paradigm.  It probably won't ever benefit you in the short run, and it will never benefit you in the long run.

Let's say you're in your home office playing with Python and invent a really useful script.  It's so wonderfully creative that you can't find anyone who has ever done anything like it, so you think you might make a few bucks for it.  You hack up a quick graphical front end and put it out there on the open market.
You are sued by 6 different companies for software patent infringement.  4 of them are in a little county in Texas that is very sympathetic to its non-practicing patent holders.  You are taken for every cent of profit for your little program.
Granted, this doesn't tend to happen until one gets pretty big and quite successful, but given the utterly ridiculous number of patents on the books, the 20-year term, and the drop in the bucket cost of filing a patent compared to the ridiculous amount of settlement profit a NPE can see, there is clearly something fucked right up with that.  Sure, this is software, and software patents don't exist everywhere.  They're spreading quite quickly due to the TPP and other agreements that are sure to follow, though.
Someone does not deserve a cut for inventing something.  Inventions happen despite the patent system, not because of it.  They were designed (even if not originally, then certainly recently) as a legal weapon for businesses to keep smaller companies from competing with them even as they design little DMZs for each other in the form of patent pools, MPEG-LA being a prominent example.
I hate to put it so bluntly, but you're a sucker for fighting their ideological battles.
