Aight so at least I know with Ripple it’s kinda like the anti crypto, crypto coin. It’s not decentralized, bank supported and has about 1/10 of its current volume of ownership controlled by its ownership. It’s cheap so you can buy a lot of it.

Yes and no when you buy and sell you are locked in at that price until the coin is delivered and then you receive the gains or the losses. It usually takes 5-10 days for coins to be delivered for your wallet. And yes around there depending on when you buy. You also need to account for fees.

You can use coinbase, gdax, kraken etc. just do a little research and see what exchange you like the best.

Just that you could be lying, not saying you are but there was no link or verification in your post that led people to believe that this was a legit or real situation.

Is it possible to sell on GDAX and then get the funds deposited into your coinbase USD wallet?

You probably need to create a new post I think the mods might have removed your post. And of course looks like a cool event!!
