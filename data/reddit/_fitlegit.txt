Like i said, yes if you want to deny reality and the clear implications of the term in the current context
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:30:20
Who gives a shit? None of this is unethical and none of it is illegal. No crime has been committed. This is what you ASKED FOR. An unregulated market, you’re welcome.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:33:52
Insider trading implies a crime. The bitcoin market can’t be regulated by design, so It will never be a crime. This is what most of you wanted. Congrats!
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:34:19
Insider trading implies a crime. No crime was committed.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:52:02
Again, if you want to deny reality and context, go
For it.

If you have a “background in options” that included any professional experience, you’d know people just use the term “short” to generally mean “position myself to make money if the price drops”, this is as simple as selling a bitcoin futures contract now. I sold one, btc price drops, The related futures price drops, I can now buy one contract to net out my obligation and I’ve made the difference between what I sold and bought at. It’s really that straight forward. Maybe the issue is that you’re assuming people will actually settle in btc, they won’t because the contracts are cash settled. They’ll rarely even cash settle. They’ll just net out their position before they’re forced to settle.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:22:58
Well, if the market has a generally poor outlook on bitcoin futures, then that could easily impact the real price of bitcoin. The market does create a vicious cycle sometimes. So that would be short positions driving down the price of btc. There are a lot of ways delta positions can impact the underlying due to the human element.
What I’ve seen much more of though than people suggesting that shorting will impact the price, is that this now creates new incentive for large scale manipulation of an entirely unregulated market. Which is the much more concerning issue.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:32:27
Do you actually believe this is true 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:16:27
Because I’m bored at work mostly. You’re an idiot if you think the private corporations and citizens who fill the void they would leave are better than them. You’re an even bigger idiot if you think accumulation of power is avoidable. You’re living the issues right now and you can’t even see it
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:51:25
I’m totally sure any of this happened and you’re not just an internet troll holding .5 a bitcoin hoping for 100k
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:39:48
It’s not insider trading because the bitcoin market is unregulated.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:30:25
I️ apologize for believing you were smart enough to get the implication without being spoon fed. Won’t make that mistake again. Allow me to rewrite my initial post so you might understand:
This is not the crime of insider trading, as you are clearly referring to it in this context. The market is unregulated, so this is by definition not a crime.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:44:33
I never said it’s always illegal, feel free to point out where I did.
My issue is with the very clear and obvious implication in this thread that people feel someone did something illegal or wrong. When people start screaming “this is insider trading!!” The implication is extremely obvious. They’re saying they committed a crime or somehow wronged them. 
You are denying this very obvious reality. And following along because you think the obvious dog whistling is a good thing, and want to rationalize it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:07:12
I’m saying your definition of “shorting” isn’t the same as everyone else’s. You seem to be using it to refer exclusively to a true short sell of real bitcoin. That isn’t how people use it
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:58:42
Large scale shorting is available because I can short the future at whatever scale I like. I don’t ever need to interact with actual btc, is the point.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:49:42
Yes, because you’ll lose it all, due to your idiotic understanding of how money works
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:44:39
It has important meanings for accounting sure. But literally no relevance to your average person determining their net worth. It’s like clinging onto Enron stock claiming that since you never sold you haven’t actually taken a loss. You’re an idiot
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:18:18
Yea some of us have jobs. we don’t live in our parents basement praying our 1 bitcoin goes to 100k
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:33:56
In common usage, people are always referring to the crime. It’s intentionally misleading to use the term to refer to something that isn’t a crime.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:34:00
So? Not a crime.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:47:13
This is what you wanted. An unregulated market. This is why it doesn’t work. Open your eyes
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:38:59
It means you have recorded a loss but are still clinging onto delusion
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:43:38
It’s intentionally misleading dog whistling. I don’t think it’s confusing, I think the use of the term is absolutely transparent. The goal is to confuse others into thinking something illegal has occurred and someone will have to pay for it. 
It’s as if you called someone a nazi and then start saying oh no, I wasn’t saying he’s racist, I’m just saying his political views are in line with the strict definition of a national socialist!! And you try to do it with a straight face. It’s purposeful and intellectually dishonest.
This doesn’t even meet the technical definition of insider trading because there’s no such thing as a bitcoin insider. What you’re trying to say is someone influential manipulates the bitcoin market. Which is accurate, and expected in an unregulated market. But that’s not nearly as helpful for you to say, so you fall back on an easy term for people to wrap their head around “insider trading” which immediately translates to “oh someone committed a crime that i read about all the time, the bitcoin market is just like normal markets”.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:31:43
Big thanks to the bag hodlers like yourself this holiday season
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:06:30
No it really doesn’t. At all
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:13:11
Sure if you’re into denying reality and redefining things to fit your outrage. The implication of the term is clear, that someone committed a crime, or some moral wrong. Neither of those things happened here. This is exactly what the bitcoin community wanted, congrats!
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:34:30
Not true, it implies a crime
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:27:24
The terms of settlement are clearly laid out in the cme contract

Bitcoin is popular because it gained a very high return early on due to its usefulness in facilitating black market transactions and has since been everyone’s fantasy get rich quick scheme requiring no more effort than buying a few digital coins and waiting. That and the enthusiasm of the union of technophiles and libertarian types is all there is to the popularity of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:25:28
It's important to distinguish that the speculation vehicle aspect doesn't exist in and of itself. there needs to be some other feature otherwise it will collapse overnight as it clicks in people's head that they're pouring their money into virtual 1s and 0s and nothing else. Bitcoins main feature shouldn't be an investment vehicle, it's utterly nonsensical, and it's value is held together by a few pieces of string right now.
As for the other 2 cases, Bitcoin is far outclassed by other methods in time, ease, security and stability. Partially because Bitcoin is so volatile. You realize how bad of a large transaction system Bitcoin is when I can put 1 dollar in and have it be worth 80 cents in 30 minutes, right? Bitcoins only attractive feature is black market purposes right now, which is one of the strings holding value together. And I don't consider that a good thing. 
There is no scenario where volatility is a good thing for Bitcoin and your insistence to the contrary is very telling of Bitcoin enthusiasts general attitude about their hobby. It's more of a cult trying to make a quick dollar than an actual movement in favor of free decentralized currency.
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:43:35
Hahahaha I'm surprised you can type with your head that deep in the sand
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:49:04
And this is why it will never be more than a sideshow. Being a generalist financial tool is a bad thing. I can split my money as I please between instruments. I'll always strictly prefer to put my money into several instruments, all specialized for a purpose, rather than in one instrument that is generalized.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:56:40
The turn around time for a Bitcoin transaction is very wide. It takes time to validate. You're exposed to Bitcoin vol everytime you make a transaction.
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:10:36
You have to realize how ridiculous it is to suggest that Bitcoin has intrinsic value outside of some functionality right? It's value right now is a combination of speculation on it becoming a viable currency and black market uses. It has no intrinsic value at all.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:27:25
Stable relative to itself, not relative to any other currency. 
You can't because Bitcoin has a structural transaction time built into it with a window plenty wide enough to lose 20% of your value.
Yes, it's value right now only exists because of its anonymous nature. Once authorities break that system, watch how quickly it falls.
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:57:24
You should probably review what you just wrote because you contradicted yourself in the space of 2 sentences but semantics really aren't important. 
The exact point I began with is that volatility is bad for Bitcoin, as it has no value without its functionality, and its not functional with high volatility. Now you're sitting here agreeing with me and just arguing for the sake of hearing yourself speak.
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:46:18
A cogent argument from a Bitcoin enthusiast. Burning money would be more efficient though
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:11:41
That sounds like it's going to last. Like I said many times, Bitcoin in reality isn't a movement towards a free and open currency. It's a Ponzi scheme with a cult like following.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:14:10
By detecting tumblers and compromising them?
I don't think anyone will ban Bitcoin. I think it will die naturally when it's no longer useful for black market purchases 
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:32:22
So yea I used to work in IB. Weird thing about what your saying... the price of gold had this strange correlation with industries that used it in manufacturing.... must've been a spurious 20 year trend or soemthing.... the problem is that you don't understand what you're saying. Yes a lot of gold is in vaults, all that does is artificially decrease supply, movements in price still correlate with manufacturing. It's only in vaults because it's held by governments for legacy purposes and they have an interest in not crashing the gold market just yet. If a meteor of gold hit the earth, yes prices would plummet because that's just how supply and demand works in a commodity market. Also if a cheaper abundant alternative to gold in manufacturing Showed up then it's price would also plummet as demand evaporates. Bitcoin however has no intrinsic value at all. It does nothing. At all, besides get enthusiasts worked up at the prospect of making a really easy dollar.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:10:45
I'm very familiar with peer networking. And very familiar with how tumblers work. Keep trying to attack my credentials makes you look like you have nothing to say.
Oh idk, maybe something like the CIA having backdoors into most computers on the planet? 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:57:01
No im just not financially vested in denying reality
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:49:38
Volatility like this invites bubbles. It attracts speculation. Aka people who will pump and dump.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:04:19
No you're misinterpreting and sound dumb. I'm saying once things like Bitcoin tumblers are neutralized and it's no longer possible to buy your kiddie porn anonymously, then it will die. I'd love to see the court case that has ruled the FBI / CIA / interpol isn't allowed to target the block chain
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:05:32
Go Bitcoin? You know a currency is considered viable only if it's relatively stable right? Volatility like this is truly terrible for a "currency"
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:32:23
Yes, violent upwards and downwards movements are both awful for a currency. Bitcoin will never be anything more than an experiment unless it levels out.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:07:47
I have owned bitcoin and actually read the white paper. I also have a financial background and am fairly familiar with the market. It's propped up by speculation and black market uses right now. When the black market goes so do the speculators. It'll crash to near 0 as soon as it's cracked.
I sold my Bitcoin when I viewed transactional volume relative to value. It's half bubble and half kiddie porn. Not soemthing I want my money in.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:06:10
Now you're just talking out of your ass. Not a word of any of that is true.
1 year sure, 5 years no.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:12:13
I meant it will not last for 5 years, 1 year sure.
It hasn't been remotely stable. I'm sure you know the difference between short term and long term vol. are you intentionally conflating the two to try and "be right" or are you genuinely unaware?
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:57:33
There's a whole range of options between giving up and sticking your head in the sand and pretending this is a good thing somehow
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:08:59
Ok. I put 100 dollars into Bitcoin to transfer to a Venezuelan. 30 minutes later it's worth 80 dollars.
I totally see how that doesn't affect usage.
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:36:38
Yes... I guess I have this issue where I assume people are grounded in reality about what a good thing and a bad thing is for something they're interested in.
Like I'm a jets fan. I didn't yell go jets when they cut Brandon Marshall. I yelled fuck really loud and made a snarky Facebook post about it.
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:41:05
Again. There's a world of space between pretending volatility is good for Bitcoin and abandoning the project 
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:22:35
I forget how strong the delusion is on Bitcoin sometimes.... really believe that nothing has intrinsic value... I guess you're not familiar with how extensively gold is used in manufacturing processes.... have a good day
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:03:02
The point is that's a bad thing. The purpose of a currency and an investment vehicle run contrary to each other. Being both is a detriment to both purposes. It's never going to be anything more than a sideshow if it doesn't evolve into a true currency.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:28:16
It will live until authorities figure out a way to make it ineffective as a black market currency, which is coming any day now. It will then die. The hard reality of bitcoin is that it's value is probably mostly propped up by kiddie porn trade. So I won't weep for it.
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:08:41
If you're uncorrelated in the sense that your correlation is a combination of the correlations of several other instruments, then no it is not valuable. As I can simulate it with various investments.
@_date: 2016-06-16 14:26:30
Oh a company based in a loosely regulated Ponzi scheme is defrauding you... I'm sooo fucking shocked. Your fault, no one else's.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:15:44
No one wants to face up to the fact that bitcoin is structurally broken in its current form.  Fuck the tech, fuck the innovation. It is not a functional currency. It’s digital gold. Spending it and holding it are both bad decisions. 
@_date: 2017-04-10 15:20:50
Bombs are just tools being used for different reasons, not inherently good or bad. Why should they be singled out just because of their destructive power? 
Maybe it's because at a certain point you need to be an adult and see that a certain tool is being used for mostly bad purposes, maybe it's not the kind of tool that should be legal.
@_date: 2017-04-10 15:51:24
Neither do I. I condemn it based on its realized application. You're just sticking your head in the sand because you stand to make money. 
@_date: 2017-04-10 15:30:13
My argument is that Reddit admins are correct in banning a thinly veiled front for trading child porn. They should take the next step and ban Bitcoin altogether. The logic has already been presented and you've had nothing to say to it other than pretending it doesn't exist. 
@_date: 2017-04-10 17:25:00
I'm sure you have.
@_date: 2017-04-10 16:29:14
You're right. I'm sure there are so many people using local coin for legitimate purposes. Since there are so many of them. I'm not a willfully ignorant person profiting off of this or anything.
@_date: 2017-04-10 15:57:13
Not at all. I'm saying you approve of Bitcoin because you're profiting and making yourself willfully ignorant to what you're actually profiting from. Which makes you a shitty person. I disapprove of Bitcoin because of how it's actually used.
@_date: 2017-04-10 16:02:54
No idea what you're talking about. Seems like you're just babbling because you don't know how to deal with the cognitive dissonance.
@_date: 2017-04-10 15:36:35
You're willing to put persona profits over preventing child abuse
@_date: 2017-04-10 15:35:43
 
@_date: 2017-04-10 15:26:22
I have. And the thing about bombs is they are strictly regulated due to the risk they present. The same should be true of Bitcoin and things like local coin that really only still exist because they facilitate child porn transactions. 
I'm not using personal attack as an argument, they're just thrown in for fun. Because I don't respect anyone who sticks their head in the sand and ignores child abuse because they stand to make a quick dollar.
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:40:33
Because the answers are:
1. It’s not
2. It doesn’t 
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:53:54
Something concrete that is 1. An actual problem and 2. Isn’t already better solved by existing solutions
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:41:02
Then shut up and let it crash and buy more at the discount. You seem oddly desperate to convince people that “this is just like all the others” with no evidence and no explanation for why none of the new developments and the different environment matters, you’re disingenuously comparing percentages without acknowledging different absolute values and very different market depth. 
Maybe you’re a little nervous?
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:38:11
Who cares? Why does that matter???
@_date: 2017-09-23 00:24:16
And asking someone here what they think of Bitcoin is like asking an uber investor what they think of uber. What's your point 
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:35:02
Not because you have no response or anything
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:12:36
Ok don’t give me a class of problem, give me a real world problem that is currently not adequately solved that can be solved by blockchain
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:25:14
You missed part 1, where it needs to be an actual problem. Centralized banking and telling if brands are fake or real Aren’t problems that are in need of solving or that will noticeably improve life. It’s nonsense.
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:33:37
I always see this nonsense “blockchain will power so many things”, like what? What actual problem does the blockchain solve?
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:36:21
Except no crypto put forward right now is actually better than the current solutions to transacting online. And transacting online is not a problem, billions do it every day with no problem whatsoever.
Again, you haven’t proposed a problem that exists and can be solved by blockchain.
@_date: 2015-10-08 03:34:36
What's your opinion on bitcoins role in facilitating the trade of child pornography? It's currently the thing most often bought with Bitcoin, so to me, profiting on Bitcoin is a bit like profiting off child porn.
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:30:42
Low (but not 0 due to use in technology and manufacturing) but it’s price isn’t in free fall like bitcoins is, if it was I’d call anyone holding it waiting for a rebound a dumb ass too. It also has a much longer history as a store of value and the investors in it aren’t a bunch of dumb asses looking to get rich quick. It also doesn’t purport to be a currency despite being functionally useless as one.
But props on focusing on one line and removing all the surrounding context.
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:39:48
Are you 16?
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:09:53
This is absurd. “Seasoned” investors calmly holding... what’s there to be calm about?
1. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. The price is in free fall as the dumb get rich quick investors flee. The only remaining users are tech enthusiasts which was always a minority.
2. The tech is too complex for the average consumer. The simplest methods of buying bitcoin require all sorts of id verification and then there is no consumer protection if a user gets scammed or defrauded.
3. Terrible for the environment. Uses more electricity than entire countries.
4. It’s impractical for everyday use. Transactions can take half an hour to complete.
5. There are 1 million better alternatives for all use cases, including the black market uses that used to be the thing keeping the value up. 
People should be pulling out of bitcoin as fast as they can.
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:23:06
Not even. Monero is way better for black market / anonymous purchases
