5:50 *"Let's say a bunch of people had already traded in advance (insider trading), then the price wouldn't have been nearly as volitile, the price would have already much closer reflect what the price would be at after the news became public."*
You've got to wonder if all of the folks behind crypto currencies have taken a *finance 101* course before. 
So insider trading is OK (doesn't really instill confidence in a platform or its founder...but alright), and even if people were insider trading, after they trade (and make their money), now the market crashes, and truly reflects what the value of the currency is.
You see the problem here, right?

It's not the banks I'm worried about -- It's the ASIC mining farms in China.

This is the part we should all be concerned about, though:

I don't believe in its current state that it is a viable alternative to fiat currency.
I also find it interesting the a nation with severe inflation shows interest in a concurrency as the solution to their problem of poor fiscal policy and government mismanagement.

It's telling that the only communities who find Bitcoin attractive are those with a failing currency.

Until someone (or a group of people getting together) owns 51% of it. 
If one controls more than 50% of mining power, you can perform a 51% attack, which allows you to write the longest blockchain, which will then be taken by the rest of the network as canonnical. 
That means, double-spend confirmed transactions, or reject any new transactions you don't approve of.

Just because you can do something, doesn't mean you should. And keep in mind, people aren't rational. 
Look at Bill Ackman shorting Herbalife. A proven pyramid scheme, yet a sucker is born every day, so someone will always buy into it.
Waits patiently for years, and finally calls it quits, once he realizes that fools will continue to buy. Perhaps a similar situation here?
Furthermore, very few people truly understand how crypto currencies or blockchain work. There are plenty of script kiddie on the internet, but how many could whiteboard the hour long session it would take to illustrate in detail how it all comes together?

You've stumbled across perhaps one of the biggest flaws with Bitcoin, which proponents will tout as a benefit:
Lack of oversight.

Who in the right mind is using bitcoin to store wealth? 
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:50:37
Right, not trade, but the % of U.S. debt that China owns. If the U.S. ever defaulted on that, I'd be afraid to consider what would happen. 


@_date: 2018-02-20 18:19:29

If the US economy suddenly crumbles, bitcoin may not be the top of your priority list.
The entire WORLD economy would crumble along with is, as so many currencies are pegged to the dollar, and numerous foreign governments (especially China), rely so heavily on not only the U.S. Dollar, but also the country for trade.
Bitcoin won't be very helpful during the apocalypse.
