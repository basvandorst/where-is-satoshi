Perhaps you have a backup somewhere? If you really lost it coins are gone.

Limit orders are your friend. Never buy instant, you will always lose money

This is great! And now you will live long enough to spend the profit and to live a nice life!

you were just lucky. Next time you sell and prices rise again. You can't beat the market in the long run, just hodl.

When buying in times like this there is no real price. Everybody just posts buy and sell orders and you can't say what will happen, instant orders are very dangerous then because you don't know what price you buy.

Have an ethereum wallet and after a year you will have a ton of free airdrop tokens. They are worthless but you hey, free crypro assets!

If you dont want to wait, try bitstamp. There you can buy with creditcard but with a 5% fee.

shill your shitcoin somewhere else...

As long as you ony invested what you can afford to lose I don't see why anyone should sell now. As long as you are not all in you can just wait until this is all over. Hopefully with a new ATH.

I only hope to see these prices until tomorrow when my paycheck comes in... This won't be the collapse of cryptos and the more you can buy at these low levels the more you profit in 1-2 years!

BTC doubled a lot of times this year. If you sell just the amount so you get your money back you have free money. If BTC moons you can be happy, if it fails you can relax!

bitcoin.com is a scamsite, wouldnt trust any information from there

You again! Do you even get paid for these FUD posts or are you just angry because you are a bad trader/investor?

Many ppl are not interested in the technology but investing in it as a new asset class that promises high return. So if crypto succeed(by beeing adopted everywhere) but the prices don't spike, it is a huge win for us but a failure for these ppl.

Any chance you are a prince from nigeria?
@_date: 2018-07-03 17:28:39
the "lol" in the beginning says it all. I got in 2 years ago and I have never sold. But every dip there are these little FUDers like you. In the end, prices will skyrocket again and people like you will have to pay much higher prices for the same amount of crypto. Just like everytime.
