It took me far too long to realize it’s only 8 pages. I expected a really long, dense, unreadable paper so I avoided it. Everyone here should read this if they haven’t yet.

I can’t use it because my bank login isn’t supported, so I’d have to use wire transfers. Why can’t I just use a routing and account number like a host of other websites?

Why do you think it has a zero cost basis? Has the IRS released anything saying that? Unless I hear differently, I'm treating it the same as a stock spinoff in my taxes.

Thanks for the link, it's an interesting read. With both a spinoff and a $0 BCH basis, your overall cost basis doesn't change so you'll end up paying taxes on the same overall gains. I think either is a reasonable strategy.

So use a different wallet. You have your keys, you don’t have to wait for them.

Probably made you a bunch of money. You can enter your seed phrase into any other wallet that supports BCH, including hardware wallets like Trezor. Search around and I’m sure you’ll find step by step instructions pretty quickly.

Do research. Your BCH is sitting wherever your BTC was at the moment of the fork. If you moved your BTC then your BCH didn’t move. The beauty and horror of cryptocurrency is that you are your own bank.

To be fair, so does GDAX. Fuck HitBtc.

Do a bunch of research and learn how private keys work. Then you’ll understand. If you had BTC in Jaxx when it forked, then those keys still contain your BCH. Just take those keys elsewhere and unlock your BCH.

Definitely post-tax.

I've just started looking into Bitcoin seriously the last couple days. I have no idea what's happening but I'm unlikely to buy in right now. Everything seems chaotic.

Ok, Coinsfer... I don’t know that the IRS is going to agree with you on that.

There are widgets for the Today screen. There should be apps available where you could see those without even unlocking your phone.

What do you buy with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:56:27
I just read the article. It re-emphasized several times that readers should be buying cryptocurrencies. It ends with:


What anti-BTC narrative did you read in this article?

After lurking for the past month, just this morning I convinced myself it was an acronym for Hold On for Dear Life.
