Sure, your $1,000 investment could possibly make you $10,000. It could even make you $100,000. You could also lose it all. There's really no way of knowing for sure right now, but it's trending in the right direction.

That's almost me. Bought at $11k only 4 days ago. Can't believe it.

I was told to only invest what I could afford to lose. Upping my investment that much would be way more than I could ever afford to lose.

Do not invest all of the money you have to your name.

Thank you friend. I've only used the iOS app in the past, just logged in to the website. Much appreciated!
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:57:00
Small amount. And then another small amount earlier today when it was still in the $12k range. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:07:54
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:34:26
And to confirm, when it finally did process they did give you the price that you bought in at, correct? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:02:59
You can buy any amount. You don't need to buy a whole bitcoin. Buy now and hold on. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:54:44
Thank you.

Explain like I'm 5.

If you want to buy Bitcoin with your bank account, yes.

I am now a proud owner of .097 BTC as of a few days ago. I read an article earlier that said there could only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence. I'm not a smart man, so I have questions.
A) When will that happen?
B) What will happen to the value of BTC once that number is reached? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:39:55
Buy now.

Litecoin is surging. The creator is going to be on CNBC this morning, roughly 11:30am. He's scheduled to talk Bitcoin but assuredly will mention LTC as well.

I bought in 3 days ago. I also spent that day wondering the same thing....just sitting there waiting for a dip big enough to get in. I decided to just say fuck it and dive in. It's up $700+ since then. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:36:21
What makes you come up with that prediction? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:59:07
1) Create an account on Coinbase
2) Link one of your bank accounts
3) Buy a small amount of Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:39:13
Thanks. Where does it say that? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:06:41
It takes a while, a few days at least.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:36:25
Right. I did consider keeping my original investment in there, and occasionally transferring out profit to then buy more BTC with. Sound idea? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:36:42
What's up with all of this talk about BTC having a hard time breaking 10k Euro? Why is that?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:53:50
There are opportunities but the processing time/fees make it difficult. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:32:43
So your transaction from 12/1 hasn't processed yet? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:35:35
As far as I know. I also just got BTC for the first time via Coinbase a few days ago (12/2) and my order is still Pending as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:15:07
Why not invest a little bit (an amount you could afford to lose) and find out?
