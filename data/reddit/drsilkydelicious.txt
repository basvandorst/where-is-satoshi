@_date: 2018-08-09 10:52:26
Can we just fucking come to terms with the fact that the price only goes up when we feel completely hopeless. Next time it goes up we have to remember to stay complacent so it will keep going up 
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:06:00
The other guys face on the title screen says it all

Anyone smart enough to buy crypto is not stupid enough to gamble it away....I hope. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 15:00:05
Yeah I think you have a particularly shitty bank in this case
@_date: 2018-05-12 11:57:11
Weird considering how much I lost in quarter one on crypto

Isn’t the point of crypto that I can actually do whatever the fuck I want with my money because it’s my money instead of letting banks or a mediocre half-meme tell me what to do?

What was your favorite meal as a child and how has it shaped the person you’ve grown up to be?
@_date: 2018-06-07 22:42:49
This could conceivably be used as a case against though too
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:25:57
Yeah that’s not fucking true at all
@_date: 2018-06-05 22:55:57
The only time the price goes up is when nobody thinks it will. Everyone get skeptical! 
@_date: 2018-06-26 20:56:09
Yeah, I totally got in at 30$ and not $12,000

You guys post this shit for 8% up now huh? 
@_date: 2019-10-09 19:46:19
It is a good thing, but the amount of delusion associated with this community is one of the reasons people are skeptical
@_date: 2018-06-18 01:47:41
What if I just need someone to talk to
@_date: 2019-10-04 18:47:24
“Should I invest even though I have no money”
“Should I invest in a bakery”

When we gonna be honest with ourselves about this shit?
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:20:51
I hope he’s right, but he doesn’t know the future value and neither do we. Just gotta watch and stay smart. That should be a forgone conclusion by now.

A decentralized currency is good for a lot of reasons but it doesn’t erase debt. 
@_date: 2018-11-03 13:18:01
Sounds like someone stole your balls

@_date: 2018-03-17 03:43:44
Hey, it went up a little 
@_date: 2018-03-23 21:58:14
Kind of an indicator that it could be replaced though

I’m officially declaring Bitcoin Core as a new genre of music mixing together elements of Metalcore with lyrical elements pertaining to Bitcoin. Henceforth, If you hear someone say Bitcoin Core assume they are talking about music and ask them what instrument they play.

Should probably just say it’s not advisable. An IRA should be diversified. So put bitcoin in your IRA, just not your whole IRA into bitcoin.

How does one become part of this network? 
Are controlled states like NY able to join this network?
@_date: 2018-07-06 00:41:21
That’s honestly not advisable at this point in time
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:48:00
Feel like there’s probably parts of the story we’re missing honestly

He built a 200m company while I was playing xbox. I don’t give a shit what type of pants/shorts he wears. And his decision to wear either does not determine how much he gives a shit which is probably a lot
