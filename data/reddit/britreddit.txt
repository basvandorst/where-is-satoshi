A suggestion, since we're working with QR codes anyway, why not have it so that you have a central server that restaurants (or other establishment) signs up to, then that restaurant is assigned a QR code, which they put at the door. When the customer walks up to the restaurant and scan it, it downloads the menu, prices, etc. from the server. This means that each place doesn't need it's own app :)

It might be advertising aspects of Bitcoin that might be attractive to your target audience. If they then take on Bitcoin, guess where they'll spend it first.

So sit tight and wait for the price to go back up before selling?

Or you could use paper wallets
