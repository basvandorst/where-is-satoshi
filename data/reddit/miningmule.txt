Somebody actually gets it!

Some of us just don't see it that way.  I could spend that same money 'golfing' or 'fishing', building custom cars, or any other number of things.  However, I mine, that's my thing - just not with CEX/Ghash anymore.

No but yours told me I was just before the best part of you ran down the inside of her leg.

Not really, If you were solo mining, that would be true. Not so much with PPS pools and regular payouts.

Yawn, but waking up in China.

Assholes like Gates don't give anything away, not to poor Africans or anyone else.  Just to prove my point, show me one person who has proof of a 'deposit' for free from Bill Gates.

I left because they raised the minimum value of trading LTC to BTC.  That killed it for a lot of us right then and there.  I heard they had some issues with the way 'some' people were trading, but they took out all the small miners trying to swat a fly.

The next thing you know, they will accept news too!  Something besides the liberal crap they spew.

And nobody denies it.  Listen up investment caps... you heard it here first.  If you want to make money with BTC, better to start by listening to the old timers at this point.  That's not free.

These accounts change all the time, they mean nothing to me.  You got ego, go for the points.
