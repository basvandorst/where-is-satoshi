I wish I knew that site existed earlier.

I inserted a high quality version of the QR code in my original post. Good Luck!
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:00:03
unfortunately not.

impressive. My damage seems more serve though, if you take a look at the picture in my edit, it is not just the QR code having missing parts, but the color-loss in the middle.

I had the same hope, asked a friend and he told me it would take million of years to crack the missing characters with current technology.
It cracked me one last time as well.
It might be hard to see on the picture, but the QR code itself is so drenched that the "squares" are not clearly visible anymore.

I didn't think of all that, those were just 100 dollar back then. You can bet how much it bites me now.

even if they were saved somewhere, the wallet is over a year old. I also formatted my pc in between. Do you think it would be possible to find the key that way?

I don't want to be rude, but I tried a lot before giving up. That is a lot of money after all. If someone really manages to crack it I just hope they donate to SeansOutpost or the Bitcoin Foundation.

whoa doesn't that go a bit overboard? Couldn't you just lament the paperwallet or print it on plastic?

I just punched 15 random numbers and letters in  because I began to be curious myself. Ended up with 6 to 377 Billion years. Oh well, I guess it won't be cracked in my lifetime, even if computational power increases massively

part of the QR code is missing and pretty much the whole QR code is so drenched, that parts are not even identifiable. It seems that 20 to 25 characters are missing in the front.
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:50:18
I just checked that out, it didn't work unfortunately. No files have been found.
I made that wallet a year ago or even longer back.

Thanks a lot! I decided to leave Bitcoin alone for now, but instead revived my paperwallet from Bitadress again.
This time with a (temporary) water proof plastic bag. I will lament it at work on monday.
Obviously I blacked out the private key this time ;-)
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:10:27
already done that a few days ago. My friend is working in that area. They told me it was pretty much hopeless.
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:33:13
sadly the chance is slim, cracking the remaining characters would take millions of years.
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:48:36
You mean like a picture of a paperwallet on a CD?
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:47:00
I have no scanner at home, I will do it at work on monday though.
