@_date: 2018-01-20 12:59:57
Yea... The thing about that though is when the price shot up the government was very much intact. There was a small Senate hearing on bitcoin to discuss how they wanted to approach it. During this time coinbase was busy "fixing their computers" so I couldn't buy btc. They were $200 a piece back then. I was lucky enough to snag one at $650 instead of the three I wanted. Also, during this time will you the bot was making fake trades with itself driving the price to $1242. So I don't think 2013 had to do with the government shut down.
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:09:49
Both. Technology first. I would have sold my Bitcoin already. Can't seem to do it every time I want to.
@_date: 2018-01-02 07:05:43
Right. But I'm sure the people actively making it might tweet something.
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:20:59
Plus, there will be adversarial governments to the U.S. that will use to it to go around the Dollar anyway. Might as well have a close relationship with bitcoin is my guess.
@_date: 2019-07-04 15:36:22
Stock prices are going to go up because of this. If bonds give no yield then it's a option taken away from investors. That's why you see the markets hitting all time highs right now. It's because they expect fed to lower rates. This economy is backwards right now and we are not properly prepared for a recession. Negative rates here we come... 3 countries right now, Japan being one, already have negative rates. It's a weird scenario that's counter intuitive if you look at the past. We are in New territory.

I heard LN was coming in April. I hear St the end of the year. Are there any official statements?
@_date: 2018-01-01 05:02:22
$650 in 2013 now worth 16k... Boy does your post annoy me. If my timing was different I'd be where you are. I invested about 600 more this year and have earned 6k in the past two months. I'm at a place where idk what to do. I'm pretty sure crypto will go up but the lack of LN support is gonna really hurt Bitcoin. I currently own 9/10 of the top ten alts and a few others. If I sell I'd have about 23k. I can buy a house right now with this. I could buy a house anyway but I'm into rental property and this would propel me two years forward in my real estate goals. I don't know what to do. Every day weighs on me. I'm the talk of my workplace and don't want to look like a fool. On the other hand, I love the high crypto gives me and I've never been a gambling man. I never really thought on a deep level I'd be here. Does the average Joe have it in them to even get to the moon with this type of uncertainty? Idk, man. Maybe we are at the moon. And now I want Saturn. This feels like a blessing as much as a curse. This is partly because this amount of money won't change my lifestyle, just advance my goals. Fml. Happy New year's and cheers to first world problems!
@_date: 2019-07-03 03:31:14
All your points are accurate. However, Bitcoin could pose a risk to the global markets as well. Of course, there is the geopolitical game theory aspect of it all. Other countries could allow it to usurp the dollar by embracing Bitcoin together. But still, the US has levers it could pull too as the owner of the reserve country. Maybe not. Maybe that's why. If you can't beat them, join them. Idk. I'm still hodling.

I think Coinbase is not equipped properly. It makes crypto look bad. Also, the timing of what they did sucks. They should get their act together and make sure the coins they have are fully supported. Also, no insider trading would be nice, too.

My ex wife used to make fun of my Bitcoin. She thought it was sooooooo stupid just like everything else I talked about. Well guess what, I had the lawyer write in the divorce agreement that she can't touch my Bitcoin. She asked how much it was worth and it was shooting up to 6k at the time. She was pissed! But also tired of negotiating. Now she told me her new man is thinking of investing in it and she's sick of hearing about it. She was really just trying to get me jealous. So instead I took the opportunity to tell her it's now worth 16k. I then laughed the heartiest laugh I have ever laughed right in her fucking face. We got divorced before Bitcoin blew up and she can't touch my fucking bitcoins! Nice house, babe. I got paid for that and now I'm getting paid by the best currency ever created! Fuck her. TO THE MOON!!!!!!

A ledger would be the tracking of the Bitcoins after each transaction and the cloud storage would be any info you store within the transaction, right?

My friend is a financial advisor. He told me that he spends all day every day talking about Bitcoin. he gets calls all day from people asking to buy some.

There is Bitcoin and the one that wants to be Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:33:25
I understand what the two forked coins are. In the end one will be Bitcoin though. The Roger Ver already calls it Bitcoin publicly. He's fighting for the brand with his formed coin. Yes, I am saying there is bias. Coinbase recently said that they will integrate segwit(which is needed to use the coming lightning network) as soon as they address their congestion and security issues. A week later they add another coin. That's bullshit. Also, if there are two coins claiming to be Bitcoin the media will turn it into a shit storm and I think it will be a turn off to the average Bitcoin noob. Makes it seem less secure than it already is. I think this is irresponsible. And full disclosure I own Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:11:26

There is one until more nodes and miners decide, no? Isn't it for the people running nodes to decide? NOT coinbase. Am I wrong?

I didn't ask. I was wondering the same thing.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:59:21
That's a good point! The Bitcoin sells access to the cryptographically secure storage space/ledger and the mining "finds" it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:53:39
True. How about this. They adopt segwit like Gemini has already and they use the mountains of cash they have to update their systems to handle the traffic? At least segwit. Pathetic.

It takes a long time. They make you go to a class when you get divorced. They said it's as hurtful as a death of a close family member and you don't feel back to "normal" for three years or something like that. It's a brutal thing to go through. The duration of the process is the worst part especially when you have kids and assets together. I am bitter but it will fade. I know it will because I want it to. Sometimes you have to relish your victories, though. This is definitely one of them!

I understand that. But if you aren't taking care of the coins you have it's wreckless, no? I mean they did just put 6k in my pocket as of 830pm... But I think long term it's gonna be bad. Once the public hears there's two bitcoins they won't understand and they will crash. Watch. It's gonna freak people out.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:04:36

@_date: 2017-12-20 02:12:16
I understand the fork process(somewhat). What I mean is that Bitcoin is Bitcoin because more people chose the original Bitcoins way to address scalability. I am not aware of what that process is and I get that this is Bitcoin cash fighting for the Bitcoin name but it seems to be without merit if regular Bitcoin is sitting there with no segwit support in coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:44:36
Can you not store text and transaction info?
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:37:43
You store money at a bank. Most of it is just numbers on your computer. Never becomes physical cash. Their online ledger is protected by a staff of IT professionals. You don't need to protect Bitcoins online ledger because cryptography protects it.

@_date: 2017-12-25 04:49:58
I'm tired of hearing that Bitcoin has no value. Bitcoin offers a decentralized cloud, basically. In order to get access to this cloud, you need Bitcoins. Bitcoins are the tickets you need to receive encrypted storage that can not be touched. Instead of calling it "digital gold" it should be compared to when the dollar was backed by gold. Bitcoin is the gold-backed dollar and the gold is the encrypted cloud storage. Why is this so hard!?!?!?!?!?!?
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:07:20
Yea but that's allegedly temporary. If LN plays out the way it should then it's all good in BTC land. Am I right?

You can still have a cold storage wallet... I don't get it. Just use this for identity instead of Facebook and protect yourself. Not every service around Bitcoin has to be about keeping your money away from the government. Stop being so narrow minded people lol

@_date: 2018-08-16 18:12:43
You are a radical. If I login with coinbase instead of Facebook, the Bitcoin I have in cold storage is still safe and sound. Also, they'll have less access to my info overall so it's a win. There are more use cases for Bitcoin besides it being money free from the government. It's not about storing your Bitcoin,it's about having an immutable address that's tied to only your name. It probably wouldn't have a large balance. I suggest you broaden your horizons and grow up a bit.
Also, if you're that worried about it check out Microsoft's decentralized identity project. I believe you will be able to have more control with the keys. It's not clear yet. Look up Daniel B. on Twitter.

Yea that's true. But if the rich bitcoiners save, the supply for the rest is scarce and the value is higher. If they spend their wealth, then it equals the playing field between rich and poor. It's really a beautiful concept. Not to mention, because it's so valuable people will be reluctant to spend. Would this end mindless consumption and consumerism as we know it? It's so fucking beautiful I may or may not have an erection right now.

@_date: 2018-10-02 00:26:00
The info attached to the identity doesn't have to be accurate, just the same. Thata why I suggested people could have more than one identity. This is so you can log into the same stuff everywhere you go. Imagine having your Reddit name as an identity. You can create different identities as a throwaway if you want. Maybe there's a scenario where you want your actual info attached to an identity you can make that identity too. Identity should only serve the purpose of solidifying the fact that you said something somewhere and if someone wants to respond they can be sure they are responding to the person that made the initial comment and subsequent ones. Or for saving the history of use of someone. This doesn't have to be attached to the actual person anymore and payments can be made without this information which is why bitcoin is big.
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:38:17

It's quite noteworthy for one day in the stock market. Especially around the broader conditions the fed is dealing with.
@_date: 2018-10-01 19:53:15
I think decentralized identities is the way to go. You create your identity and have the private keys to your data. From there, every web site is like Facebook in a way if they allow comments because it comes from your identity. Also, big players like Google can still look at your identity data and does no harm because it's not attached to your name or any personal info, unless you want it to be. You can then join different social networks of your choosing and remain anonymous or create another identity with your real identity but separate from your daily use identity if you want to be known who you are like Facebook. That would be cool. We'd get the benefits from machine learning from big companies but retain our privacy when and how we need it.
@_date: 2018-10-29 18:04:03

Disagree with what? You're still thinking about it like it would be in an inflation based economy.

In this circumstance you'd be able to buy a house sooner and own it completely. It would literally be a different world to live in.
@_date: 2018-10-24 01:54:30
I thought the big money saver with bitcoin was that there are no trucks driving cash around? Stable coins backed by fiat will cut into bitcoin for sure bit physical cash would need to be hauled around at some point. Although if the government got on board they could just go cashless and bitcoin would be hurt pretty badly. Though the place in the world for a stateless form of money like bitcoin would still be there. Maybe bitcoin won't pass 10k again.
@_date: 2018-10-16 00:13:04
Can you back that up?

@_date: 2018-10-26 13:55:57
Stable coins are a way to use fiat while cutting out banks. The biggest loser from this will be ripple. They are the use case ripple has been trying to implement and it's better than ripple. Also, they are built on the ethereum block chain. Another point is that if banks can be cut out of the equation,then you took the hardest part of crypto away. Bitcoin is still stateless and decentralized and has a finite supply. I think everything is gonna be alright.
@_date: 2019-11-02 00:34:04

@_date: 2018-10-25 18:18:14
Wrong. Credit is a vital part of an economy that is based on an inflationary currency. I don't think will ever come to that. I kind of hope it doesn't. A lot of people would be poor because they would have lost all their fiat. However, I hope a good writer writes a novel that takes place in a bitcoin based economy. That would be cool as hell!

Um... What problem is this solving?
@_date: 2018-10-26 13:44:37
Well it's speculation on both our ends. I'm just saying that if it were a bitcoin only world, then people would only have what they have and free market forces would do their thing and prices would be what the market determines. If credit was not something that could be offered because bitcoin is deflationary, then what would be the alternative? I've been meaning to read a book in the history of money. It was recommended to me in here. 800 page anthropological book on the origins of barter, credit and fiat. The person suggested to me the answer to my questions about this issue lie in there.
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:05:14

The fed is trying to reverse the course it has been on for the past ten years. They are trying to get rates to the "normal" range after being so low for so long. The problem is that it affects the price of bonds in a way that the 2 year bond becomes more expensive than the ten year bond. This is called a "yield curve inversion". Every time this has happened a recession has come within 6-12 months of that. Also, rising bond rates entices investors to become interested in bonds again because they are a safe way to make money (for obvious reasons). This obviously pulls money from the stock market because people are trying to diversify their portfolios and find ways to make money. If you Google the Dow Jones average the past couple of days you will see there is a major correction going on. Also, trump knows this is what's happening and has publicly made statements about how he thinks the fed is being too aggressive with the rate hikes. It's dangerous to invert the yield curve right now because rates are still historically low. This is dangerous because the fed typically lowers rates during recessions to take pressure off the economy to help turn it around. If they don't have the tools they need to fight off a recession we might have to go back into another round of quantitative easing and might even face negative interest rates and another "great recession" or worse. Imagine a bank account that takes money out of your account because you park it there? Bonds won't yield anything and stocks/house prices will shoot through the roof again because that's the only place investors will be able to make/protect their money. The only place besides bitcoin, of course. The government won't be able to touch that and bakkt will allow pretty much anyone an onramp. Also, trade wars are adding to the pressure of all of this. It's some pretty fucked up stuff. So if the stock market goes through more of these corrections or even encounters a crash, the publics sentiment of what bitcoin is will be visible by seeing how the price holds up. If the price remains relatively stable... Then WOW. Buy some more because we will have something outside of government control that people truly believe in. This really is like the season finale to the bitcoin saga. Real life really does write the best stories sometimes. The timing of all this couldn't have been any more epic. Unbelievable.
@_date: 2018-10-11 03:05:26
It's kind of interesting that bigger wallets are starting to roll out with compatibility with LN, rate hikes/looming recession, Microsoft's decentralized identity stuff should be coming out soon(probably bitcoin with lightning network on the back end), bakkt and the inevitable ETF. Wait another year and a half and then the next halvening. It's definitely like the season finale. I like that comparison. Back in 2013 when I bought, I am not sure I'd believe all of this. It's an early bitcoiners dream come true. Now is the ultimate moment to see if this thing is really going to take off. I suspect it will!

You're missing the point. This isn't about Bitcoin. It's about China creating a crypto Yuan that doesn't exist within the Swift payment network. Bitcoin will ride the wave. It, along with other cryptos will be more options in a new world where US hegemony is all but wiped out. Things that will matter will be the deals you can cut and the things your country can produce. Game theory on steroids. I think you aren't reading into this enough.

I think China is messing with Trump's head. Libra looks bad and Bitcoin goes down.

Wonder if its like a passive threat to the dollar and an attempt at leverage in the trade war.
@_date: 2019-10-26 03:12:44
Right. But they haven't, why? I think because it will be like whack a mole. Eventually a crypto would rise with the tides of fiat crypto as awareness rises. As awareness of what crypto is rises, the legitimacy of them will sink into the average persons head. This could lead to the full network effect of a decentralized crypto to be fully realized.

Not if the fed raises rates. Look what happened this past year when the Fed merely spoke of rate increases in early 2018. The trade war wasn't even in the picture. If you zoomed out of the charts, the fall(when they started raising rates) brought a huge drop in the market . It was a notable drop in comparison to any other pre recession drop, historically.

You are so wrong. You get paid to buy bonds now. It's a loan to the government. Negative yields means you pay to own a bond. Negative yields pay you when you have a mortgage. No place to put your money means massive asset bubbles. We've already seen it to a degree because of quantitative easing in the U. S.

I think the higher the price gets, the more out of reach it is to the average person. However, if you understand the massive size of forex markets and the gold market cap, it can obviously ten x itself. Smarter buyers will be the ones here. If they are a regular guy he won't be able to buy as much to impact market cap. So I suspect the hype among the average user will go down and it will start entering the bigger markets. I think when that happens (&gt;20k) we'll see swings that behave differently because bigger institutions will be buying and selling quicker and in a disciplined manner because they will have rules guiding them in terms of total risk of their portfolio. Probably less hodling and more frequent cash outs and a steady ladder up to 350k. Plus the average person will want to sell at prices like 50k. Who knows, though. It is Bitcoin, after all.

I also couldn't believe how he responded in a way that implied it is inevitable. 2013 me wouldn't believe myself if I went back in time. This is a serious personal security issue right now for anyone holding even .25 or more. I always thought this would happen but at the same time I didn't truly believe it would.

No, this is true. It's a big reason, or THE reason the fed is involved in the repo market. They are letting banks borrow money from them overnight. Usually banks do this for each other but banks won't lend to each other because they don't believe the other bank will be good for it. Why? Because europe has negative interest rates. If you open up an account in USD, you get interest. So people are trading their currency for USD.

Depends what you use your cash for. Seems like a power grab. What's scary is they could just treat any cash crypto or USD the same. 3% charge to transfer to e-money. How is cash distributed? Who decides that? Is it decided or just what you make in society between one another? Does the government raise taxes, force you to convert your cash and you have to pay the fee so you can pay the taxes and then start printing more e-money again to reduce the burden of taxes after people complain all the while they literally just stole money directly from you? This is fucking frightening.
EDIT: so to keep fiat alive we will foot the bill for hyperinflation with Bitcoin via currency conversion fees and taxation. Pack it up, boys. We lost.

Also, you could charge people money to transmit messages to your site therefore making ddos attacks very expensive and ultimately mitigating them. You can create a decentralized identity based off of your public/private keys and choose what data big companies can get from you. You can create a side chain that allows dapps. Because the dapps could have a code hash it's like having a checksum built in, therefore showing the code on the site hasn't been tainted and is safe in addition to an ssl certificate.

Sharding is a way to create another ethereum because scaling is a tough problem to solve. I feel like that points to side chains being a better solution. The base layer(Bitcoin) would be more decentralized. However, erc-20 standard is pretty handy and they already have an ecosystem. The question is, I think, if sharding is decentralized enough, then ethereum is the winner. The difference would thennbe that Bitcoin doesn't have a spokesperson, which makes it unique. That could keep it attractive.

Bitcoin can process the algorithm needed to mine better than the 500 most powerful supercomputers COMBINED! Also, the mining of Bitcoin is timed to be every 10 minutes or so. If Bitcoins start to get mines faster, the difficulty of the algorithms(hashing) goes up until it's ten minutes again. also, bitcoin uses like a million dollars of electricity a day mining Bitcoin. So you'd essentially have to pay for that only to have difficulty turned up and wait ten minutes for your bitcoins. Plus, supercomputers aren't optimized to process the kinds of math the mining rigs are optimized for. Sure, the government could ban it. But they could still be used by anyone. Look at what happened with illegal music downloading. It forced the music industry to restructure to a streaming format to compete because the government couldn't stop p2p networks. P2p networks are decentralized, no single point of failure. Also, adversarial governments could promote bitcoin and the U.S. would only lose out of bitcoins because of it. Also, our software is not Rock solid. That's why we have malware, hacks, identity theft and teams of people trying to make your bank transactions safe. Bitcoin is safe, cheap, out of the hands of the government (like gold) and solves the Byzantine General's problem. It's beautiful.
@_date: 2019-01-31 16:51:11
You're missing the point. With decentralized identity, comes attestations and reputation. Whoever produces fake videos will have to own up to it and it will hurt their reputation and people will be less likely to trust that source in the future.

Before bitcoin there was no way to send information between to parties that don't trust one another and gaurantee that the information was not manipulated along the way. It's called the Byzantine General's problem. The intrinsic value lies in the immutability of the information being sent across the network.

Bitcoin solved an unsolved computer science problem known as the "Byzantine General's problem". Basically, until bitcoin, there was no way to send data between two computers who don't trust each other and know for sure said data wasn't manipulated in some way. That's the greatest innovation of this and where Bitcoin's intrinsic value lies. Decentralization is basically the term used to describe the nature of the network. Basically, there is no Central point of failure in the network because it's a public network of computers running the same bitcoin software and they all verify the transactions on their end to keep the network honest. Basically a room full of strangers with a camcorder on someone in the middle of the room for a record of what happened to think of it another way. It's not better than pay pal yet. You'll see the lightning network get talked about a lot here. Once that's done, it will theoretically be able to process wayyyy more transactions per second than pay pal. Also, more features are that there is a set amount of bitcoins and no single entity or government is in control of it. Hope that helps.
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:43:33
I suppose I'm having trouble because this is the tough part. Someone's gotta come up with a unique use for this. But I suppose if I'm understanding this, someone can create a business from allowing others to use certain functions of their business. So like more cooperation will spring from this because the monetization is simplified and new? Certain types of data can be charged for in satoshis and because millions of users are possibly involved it could add up. Also, could this reduce ddos attacks? Could someone on an attacked site start charging for API calls from certain ip addresses that exceed a set amount of calls per second or minute? Am I understanding this?

So how about a streaming service? Artists are paid per stream a few satoshis and instead of servers streaming to millions of people the artists stream from their personal computer setup or a locally based server company? So the "Spotify" acts only as an aggregator of streaming locations with minimal overhead because no servers. Small acts could stream their stuff themselves and get paid directly per call and larger acts could hire services that are smaller and could be pushed around by leverage because they aren't owned by Facebook and won't be able to take as much money from the artists like Spotify?

@_date: 2015-09-16 21:37:15
That's what I don't get. So....you want a bunch of computers hooked up together to record transactions? Um....isn't that a network with encrypted ftp? I'm really lost. I read one article saying banks can't do fractional reserve banking amd want to make a currency that can do that. They just don't get it. I feel like all the big banks are finally sitting down and learning about bitcoin. I feel like they will realize eventually that Bitcoin is going to take up it's own space that doesn't compete with the dollar or other currencies. It's going to be their back-end.
@_date: 2015-09-28 21:12:00
Um......yea you do. There's this thing called dollars and the only place I can keep them is under my mattress or in this nifty place called a bank. Oh, and other countries have their own currencies too. They need banks too. In fact, there will always be currencies and a need to store them. The biggest threat to them is the elimination of cash. I know most of the money I spend is with my debit card. That's called "digital money". I never touch cash. One day the only money people might use will be digital. What will banks do? The threat to the profit of banks is virtualization of money, not bitcoin. Still, there will be a need to convert, track, store and use them. You could spend them online but bitcoin could be the back end of the transaction that the user never sees.

It would cause mass refinancing and inject a fuck ton of money into the economy. People would have $500 extra a month to spend. Also, house prices would probably rise because homes would become more affordable. It's possible that real estate would be more appealing because cash is definitely not an option. Stocks would definitely skyrocket because no point in having a savings account. I wonder how they stop bank runs?

 The word bitcoin is the elephant in the room. I don't detect an outright dislike for bitcoin, they just use the word "blockchain" because bitcoin  can't work just yet because of scalability issues. They seem to think that a blockchain (probably bitcoin) is the inevitability of their industry, they just don't know what to do about it in this moment. I also think they are trying too hard to figure out the end result of what this technology is going to be. They need to focus on the now. What can a "blockchain" accomplish for us in the present moment? They need to solve those problems first. 
@_date: 2015-11-17 00:35:53
This sounds cool but doesn't explain how this method is cheaper than the legacy system. Also, if banks are the miners, who trusts them to not double spend or screw with the ledger?
Edit: after i typed this i realized we trust them anyway, like stated in the article. This is the first argument against bitcoin that makes me want to spend mine. Good read.
@_date: 2015-10-13 16:34:06
No I'm not new. I understand it fairly well for a non-developer. I just haven't heard a viable argument in this sub pointing out why the banks can't create their own blockchain. I'm not sure I follow your logic that a small network is as secure as a larger one. Larger network minimizes ability of the old double spend. Lots of crap in this sub. I might have to start following andreas on twitter.

@_date: 2015-10-13 11:43:08
I understand that bitcoins are just data so they think the data can be what is transferred. However, if there isn't something that's being transferred that's valuable to everyone involved (miners and bitcoin users) there's no incentive to be a miner. Less miners means less security, correct?

I hold it because I believe it will increase in price exponentially. I believe it will because of it's intrinsic value. When I think of all that bitcoin can do for society and the internet my heart beats faster. I'm passionate about it that's why I didn't sell at the peak. It's gambling and it's also a protest to our financial system. The biggest display of it's intrinsic value will be first seen with decentralized identity. The lead dev of Microsoft's decentralized identity project recently revealed that Microsoft has partnered to offer decentralized identity via a public blockchain. He said that if you look at the source code you can figure out which public blockchain they plan on using. When digging through the source you will discover that they are going to use Bitcoin! You can figure it out because the source code states they are going to use a public blockchain where the miners use proof of work. Ethereum is going to switch to proof of stake so... You can connect the dots from there. They already have an identity system that uses Ethereum via Azure.

There are a lot of speculators that don't understand the tech. However, they are making a good bet, imo.

It's because it's unfettered free market capitalism. Once exchanges are monitored and regulated like the others it will calm down. There's a place in the world or bitcoin. 3k or 300k? Time will tell but really this is all just lack of regulation and lack of a final scaling solution.
@_date: 2019-05-16 01:14:31
If you want a token you can create one on Bitcoin. Now it's simple and easy and this is already connected to some exchanges. So you can issue something and yes, your business is centralized like countless others and trust is involved, but you have an item(token) that has an existence that is immutable, indisputable and worth actual value from day one(btc peg) in a digital setting.

This doesn't exactly comfort me. BTC is better for money transfer than western union, however, the market cap for money transfer is at about where BTC is now. The store of value lies in how it is useful. The more uses it has, the more intrinsically valuable it is. Take away the point of sale benefits and my mom will veer towards ripple. Deflationary currency...aren't they both finite? Low fees for transfers...pretty sure i've read they both do that. They could also hedge against collapsing currencies....ok....the whole avoid "government control" is probably the killer. BTC can't be contained. Also, i'd imagine people would be way more open to NOT supporting a corporation. They aren't trustworthy.
I apologize for my public spewing of thought. I keep seeing ripple pop up here and there and it makes me worry. In light of me paying 700 for a coin I can't help but question my investment. I'm gonna stay with bitcoin. I hate corporations. If they are what makes government bad, then why would I want one to control my money in an even MORE direct way. Sorry. Peace.

I honestly have no idea. There would obviously be a flock of average Joes to contribute, but who knows how much computing power that would make. I read somewhere that miners would receive some sort of transaction fee when there are no more blocks to mine. If bitcoins are millions of dollars then there would still be money to be made.  So maybe the big guys wouldn't leave. The problem with that is it kills the money transfer/payment model that gives btc it's intrinsic value. I'm still trying to understand this myself.

So basically because btc and ltc are peer to peer then governments know better than to shut it down. Ripple could get shut down because it's a company.

Right now it's like a stock but later it will be like a currency. It's like a stock because it hasn't reached the point where it can't get any bigger! It's finding it's place in the world.

lol... I didn't get how the password was attached to the wallet because I didn't click "bip38" BEFORE I clicked generate haha... Oh my... Now it's nice and blue! 
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:14:06
Put your man pants on and buy in at 800 like me! 
@_date: 2013-12-18 02:43:04
That would be a good thing

You're delusional. If it's on the tor network then I want nothing to do with it. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:18:18
I get mine instantly.

China was only implementing their december 5th announcement. Chill. Everything is fine. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:41:50
I like this guy 
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:52:31
How does this get a down vote? 
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:29:47
So basically btc made headway in China today. Cool. I haven't been able to decipher their stance on it from what I have read. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:17:03
damn, that *is* cool!

Shut up. Coinbase isn't a scam. Deal with your problem with them. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:25:47
They are regulating it. It won't always be what you want but at least they aren't banning it. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:12:05
Your headline sucks. Video was really good.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:38:15
You don't have to go to github. You can put Ubuntu on a usb stick  (follow instructions on Ubuntu website) and when you fire up your computer make sure there is no hard drive in it and your printer is "dumb". Then go to bitaddress.org and IMMEDIATELY unplug your router. Then you should generate some bip38 encrypted addresses(the wallet turns blue when they are bip38). Then you print them and send your coin to the addresses! 
Edit:  You can also save bitaddress.org as an htm file on a second stick. I couldn't access the stick running Ubuntu as a storage unit and I didn't have a second stick so I did what I described above.

Apple sucks. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 12:44:18
I'm right there with you! A lot of good news is happening but I feel like I really gotta scrutinize it to make sure I get accurate news!
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:18:37
Nope. I buy bitcoin for a hundred and the next day it's two hundred I then buy with my profits. The more profits because of exploitation from wall street pumping and dumping means more willing to purchase with and accept bitcoin. If tomorrow worth more than today everybody wins! 
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:49:13
Keep pumping it before you dump it! 
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:48:56
Good to know! Thanks! 
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:49:42
I just though this would have been made a bigger deal. I found a link on blockchain.info. Crazy.

It's enough to make me rich if I own just one. That's all I care about.

Bitcoin trust website said if btc market cap reached 5% of gold they would be about 40k or so. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 08:00:07
I'm fine with the bank account number and routing number. That's completely normal. If you want your account to be verified quickly so you can buy shortly after you sign up it wants username/password info. I was just curious if others gave them this information.
@_date: 2013-12-08 14:27:41
As long as there is the potential for people to want/need to cash out, there will be a demand for merchants to accept it. It's gold but with more liquidity. How is that bad? Also,  it's not about just believing in bitcoin for no good reason. It's not about believing in something that deserves to be believed in. You're here for a reason. You'll figure it out.

Meeeee too! I'm so excited! 
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:19:56
You just got me so excited about this lol
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:13:37
Maybe Max Keiser's tweet about a "billion dollar player" entering the market in February was legit. Maybe it's Western Union haha!.....yea right.
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:06:09
It's amazing how far bitcoin has come with no marketing budget lol
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:45:32
You are right. I just couldn't believe it at first 
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:47:03
To the moon! 
@_date: 2013-12-14 05:00:53
Doesn't Satoshi have a huge amount of BTC?
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:12:27
Can someone respond to this articles claim that mining isn't sustainable? Wouldn't bitcoins be worth more when the blocks are smaller? I would probably keep mining if they were 40k each. If they weren't worth the trouble of mining with expensive equipment then wouldn't the big miners get out and let the little guys mine? This article seems like
 pretentious rubbish to me. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:06:01
A lot of people would be in trouble lol
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:42:39
Why do you have the blockchain on your computer? 
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:56:49
I think it's a tinfoil-hat precaution. In case someone is hacking your network or something. It's easy enough that I did it. I followed instructions I found on this sub. Besides, bitaddress.org still generates codes offline, so why not take the extra precaution? 
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:17:14

You can buy 1BTC a week instantly for first 30 days! That's cool at least!

I hate a lot of things about Ripple. I just think that people keep their eyes open. I love Bitcoin and would never invest nearly the same amount into Ripple. However, there are a lot of "morons" in the world.
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:10:54
This is fake 
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:41:20
This is really really cool!

I'm gonna withdraw my dollars from savings right now and spend them. Shit. I've been doing it wrong! 
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:40:41
No miners and bitcoin doesn't exist.
