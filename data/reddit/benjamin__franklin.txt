I don't really see how a comment about an 800% increase in value makes us the butt of the joke. Care to explain?

This is pretty cool. I sent them a message on facebook showing my support, and gave it a share. Waka is fairly big in the festie scene, and this would be great exposure.

While he did suggest that, it is not based on any evidence or facts. He also suggests that the spores were sent from an alien world. I need more than a grain of salt to read McKenna.
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:55:10
Yes. That would be huge. The 6th most visited website acknowledging that btc is usable and a viable way of payment would make a lot of people question their own stance.

I believe this is a deliberate attempt by the hackers to pin the theft on  Mark. He is big enough of a scumbag that most will believe it. 
If I was a hacker attempting to get away with the coins, it is what I would do. Use gox's own splitting code, and deliberately leak red hearings in the form of hacked databases, and balances. 
I don't think anything will be confirmed until the bankruptcy proceedings play out or the coins get dumped on the market.
@_date: 2014-03-09 02:20:49
Congrats. 
In order to enable instant buy on coinbase, you need to attach a visa CC to your account. 
In the mean time I would recommend reading up on wallets and cold storage. Your coins are not really yours until you control the private keys.

so you want to trade money for bitcoin, but without trading money for bitcoin? That is experimental.

You should also probably stick to one family. Having a second wife and raising another set of kids could be expensive.

So edgy. Maybe they closed your account to avoid someone from being cut on all that edge. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:10:37
What trouble? they would have to split the coins down to launder them anyway, why not use gox own code, and making a blog post and a couple reddit threads isn't that much work. 
IMO, they are trying to cover their tracks because of the attempted repercussions from the criminal organizations that lost money. Obviously there will be no legal repercussion. 
Also, for the lul

Well don't tease us. What did he say!??
Kidding, it actually went like this. It was in his short opening bit pre intro. 
"A new project plans to give each MIT undergraduate $100 worth of bitcoin. Wait, $60 worth of bitcoin. No wait, $800 worth of bitcoin.
Welcome to the Colbert Report. Eeeeeeeeerk"

Urbanspoon is fairly useful for food and menus. It doesn't cover as many service categories as yelp, but the reviews seem to be legitimate. I haven't researched their practices myself, but I also haven't heard any talk about extortion for ratings.

Fingers crossed, but I won't hold my breath for it being bitcoin. I can't imagine Zuckerberg will be to thrilled about backing something that the Winklevoss twins are so closely tied to.

I'm still not sure what point you are trying to make. Where did anyone say treatment was a bad thing or shouldn't be made available?
@_date: 2014-03-09 06:02:57
I understand that just fine.

I can say I have felt the same about the whole situation. Open communication with multiple outlets is a massive step down the path towards an amicable consensus.

I mean they really are not that barbaric. They follow the proper guidelines and fur/trappers have a long history in Canada. I would rather have locally sourced fur than full synthetic any day.

They make great stuff, but this is one thing that worries me. I have noticed the quality go down slightly since they have become so popular. With that price has also slightly increased. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 04:28:42
You are right. Difficulty would counter balance much of the hash rate. However, the implications of 60% of the network having a 50% reduction of electricity cost while a 40% increase in hash would make a dent in the halving timeline. No? And I've been drinking so take my vague generalities with a medium size grain of salt.

@_date: 2015-08-21 03:05:42
So assuming 60% upgraded, and plugged these in soonish, the halving would be pushed up a 2-3 months. That doesn't include competitor's hardware, or take into account the decreased electricity cost, leaving room for addition not just substitution. Assuming all of this, shit could get interesting.

Not all the mods here are pro censorship, and the mods on voat are some that are not pro censorship. There is open discussion going on there right now. Have you even been there or do you just repeat stuff ou heard?
@_date: 2015-07-04 22:25:43
No way. Pimps be pimpin.
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:13:58
I'm not going to go out of my way to defend the mods here, but I just see StarMaged and Theymos as the main source of deleting topics they don't agree with. The open transparency of the mods at /v/ is a lot better than here. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 04:43:51
It's true, but I don't think we are bad people. You see, a pimps love is very different from that of a square.
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:29:32
Having an opinion that it is an alt is very different than wholesale deleting threads. Voat actually has a [mod log]( you can see every topic that is deleted.

I disagree with holding coins in coinbase. It is always best to hold your own keys.

All flavored cigarettes and cloves have been banned in the US since 2009. It has nothing to do with duty.

Yea, I fully expected this when I saw the post the other day advertising they sold cloves and used coinbase.

They are not the first though. This has been a policy of Chase Bank for a couple years. Need an ID to deposit, can't deposit in someone else's account. I've even been denied exchanging 20s for 100s unless I give my account info, if I don't have an account there, they tell me they can't help me. The trend is heading that way and the fight against cash is very real.
@_date: 2015-09-30 05:39:34
The 21 won't make running a node profitable. Even if it allows you to break even, you are still out the $400. A new Pi2 is $40.
@_date: 2015-09-11 00:56:23
It's doing well. Unless you believed the halving moon hype and bought at 6. It got pumped up then settled down significantly higher than it was a few months ago. Time will tell if it holds.  I expect the same sort of thing to happen when bitcoins halving approaches, but my guess would be less drastic swings. 
@_date: 2015-09-26 14:24:41
Are you pretending like this has nothing to do with cloves being banned in the country that Coinbase operates?

My favorite part was when blogs and journalists used that post for info then ran with it. Those articles were than posted back  here multiple times. I even saw a couple in /r/technology
