i can't help but wonder why Satoshi wanted the specs the way they were.  maybe he foresaw a supposed difference, like the number of miners on the network, at this point?
@_date: 2015-12-20 13:36:07
Which is minuscule compared to the insurmountable fraud attributable to central banking, unbacked fiat currency, and physical cash.
they only want to demonize bitcoin, it has nothing to do with some crusade for justice - that's just a facade.
It's like an established window maker who makes windows that always have around 5% of their product dirty when it comes out of the factory.  A small startup competitor comes out, and the established maker ridicules and berates the small startup's product for having a speck of dust on a sample piece.  (they don't really care about the dust)

It's mining that is the problem.  Transactions are extremely easy for a full node to verify, mining node or not.  The distributed hash table combined with this aspect of transaction verification should be the way forward.  What this means is that the fastest node (theoretically) will almost always verify and propagate transactions first.
Even if it means everyone has to dedicate a fucking petabyte of storage just for their local copy of the ledger. Maximum durability and maximum distribution - which means complete homogeneous uncut usability for the network. fuck this miner pool mining bullshit noise.  Even if it means not being possible for most mobile devices to run.  This greed poking its ugly head out from the shadows, even when it's a feature designed to get around "ponzi scheme" single key-pair associating all of the coin at genesis.
I realize that there's still a lot of coin to be mined, but
fuck it all, and above all, fuck anything that even starts conversations like "only run in data centers"

wrong, miner and users can both "secure" the network by ignoring bad transactions. miners are there to provide a solution to the weariness of people towards the initial influx of coin, during the network's genesis. it's an entirely temporary process.
@_date: 2016-01-06 11:55:28
not really.  a client only network is theoretically possible, since verification of transactions is extremely easy.  in fact, once all BTC are mined, it will be a client only network.  by client i mean a normal node, not a mining node.  
mining is only temporary to disperse the coin across many people for doing "work", instead of just allocating them to a preset list of entities in the genesis block, as that would just piss everyone off and the entire thing would be DOA.  Mining is a wasteful solution to a sort of chicken-or-egg problem, because people are too weary about how money's initial appearance takes place.  eventually the network will reach equilibrium (all coin "mined") and we can scrap all worries about mining and what mining does, as there will  be no more need for it - everything will become as it should be, client verified.  the only worries at that point will be people loosing coin causing the coin supply diminishing, deflation.  There will always be contention about who controls or supplies the official source code, and the attributes they decide on, but hopefully not so much as to cripple the growth of the coin.

mining is a temporary and insignificant aspect of bitcoin, in the broad picture.
@_date: 2016-01-06 12:18:46
except that verification of transactions is extremely easy, as opposed to the job of an antique appraiser.  this is a question of where people get their source code, and who they trust to supply it and alter it.

that's the problem with any attempt at accountability or reputation system - there are inaccuracies.
the harder question, is ***how*** accurate the list is while ignoring things like the spelling of the entities' names.  Discrepancy about where the VPN is, or lies about logging, are indeed the biggest ones- it would have to be a crowd-sourced effort to apply that kind of scrutiny.  one guy noticing one nasty does not invalidate the entire thing, that's not how life works.

just saying that trolls are gonna troll.  they sometimes think they can detract from your argument by pretending that it's too complicated or convoluted for them to understand, and therefore invalid or weak.
but i agree, gold is the only form of money to stand the test of time, according to history.  people want a stable form of money that doesn't control them like the unbacked fiat currencies of the world do.  Bitcoin is and always will be the most stable and empowering/uncontrolling form of money, so as long as we have the internet (as the internet is right now)
people can only be controlled through cognitive dissonance for so long until they begin to wake up and think for themselves.

they want to remain the holders of power, and want to continue to use tools that provides that conduit.  Bitcoin, however empowers its holders, it does not try to control  the behavior of the individual, it is diametrically opposed to the big bankers' ideal platform.  This is why what we feel a banker is today, will never be someone/something "holding the keys" for a truly free system such as Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-02 02:28:21
there has been a war on cash for a few years now, but not for the utopian reasons one might think.
It's about control.  "they" the establishment, can control you through the use of highly digital banking systems, such as the credit card / debit card system, and simple cashless banking such as depositing a check in the bank.  This is not about empowering individuals through the use of Bitcoin, this is about having a war on semi-anonymous use of cash.  
Bill Gates doesn't like Bitcoin because it's uncontrolling and empowers the individual instead of the controlling masters.
remember this well.


fucking smug assholes trying to tell you ***why*** it was invented.  completely misleading.  it wasn't about dissatisfaction with cash, it is about empowering the individual and taking back freedom from the centrally established masters
this article doesn't make the distinction between coins and notes, in that coins have scarcity in the metal they are made of and notes are the same bullshit nothing-backed IOU shit fiat, but instead they choose to lump the two together, of fucking course.  it's shit, their article is shit, and is completely sucking the government nutsack.

@_date: 2016-02-13 02:04:48


we've been taught to believe that unbacked fiat currency is money, but it's not.
it's a control structure highly dependent on perception, and in no way money.  If you want to easily spot mass manipulation, just look for the perversion or distortion of language, like the transitioning of the word money when it was debased - people were allowed and encouraged to continue calling the USD money, or when barbarian gold coins became mostly not gold, they didn't fucking dare change from calling it money to something revealing its fake pretend, deceptive nature, because the scheme depended 99% ***on perception***, and that manipulation required the warping of (continue calling the fake stuff money) the meaning of the word people used for money.
another perversion, kind of like that one is the word save,  when you see the advertising industry telling you to save 10% on whatever item, by buying one, you aren't saving a god damn thing, you're actually spending "money".
and of course a more distant one is the word free, "free phone" with a cell phone contract actually means "we will loan it to you, and you will have to pay us back over a couple years"  (free my dick)


spot on
"health insurance"  is another one that's treading dangerously close to something completely different than what we normally think of as health insurance.  astronomical cost of health care , and the way the medical industrial complex and its legally protected monopolistic cartels operate has somewhat hijacked the idea of health insurance.

if the fed and treasury really wanted to remain "in power" they could theoretically pre-mine a bitcoin fork and keep their dog and pony show working via that fork.  they probably already have a secret alpha in testing - they are probably hung up on further conniving ways to control the users, preventing it from empowering the individual, the way Bitcoin does.
@_date: 2016-02-25 20:25:14
It's the miners-run-everything crap architecture.  get every client to be able to verify transactions, as was intended.  That's the great thing about signing, it's hard to guess (or forge) and supremely easy to verify.

hopefully the infrastructure bitcoin relies on such as the electrical grid and the internet remains effective enough to support it.  
chances are the ones who fail to keep their systems of control working will try to sabatoge the alternative systems in any way possible (see Obama's "Internet Kill Switch")

the miner thing has gotten out of control.  Satoshi's vision was to be able to truly decentralize the system by having every node able to verify transactions, not just the miners
