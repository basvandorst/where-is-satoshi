The link to the paper didn't lead anywhere for me unfortunately. It's not clear how Central Banks as Sources of Instability = Free Banks are Sources of Stability. Would you mind citing the relevant portion of the paper that underlines your point?
The examples of Free Banking the wiki were all replaced by regulated banks. Is there any analysis as to why that occurred? Was there a common reason for their replacement? Also, I noticed that these free banking examples all took place in mid to late 19th century. I'm curious about that too.
Finally, it seems that a land price crash caused the Australian system to become regulated via bankruptcy legislation. Does this mean that the Australian example actually failed? 
I feel like I should go to askHistory for these questions, haha.
What is the test for a successful banking system? I think that from the examples you listed it might be that the systems achieved some success through stability.  However, I think another part of the test must be the ability to compete successfully and to persist.
I draw no conclusions from this, but none of the examples listed persisted to present day according to the Wikipage you referenced. 
I am not an economist. I neither support nor oppose Bitcoin. I am curious about it though. 
Also, if you'll forgive the observation, there does seem to be a blind enthusiasm associated with BitCoin from some folks. It makes me nervous and I find myself doubting that they can permit themselves to make credible statements about the currency they favor. 
You seem to be a supporter for BitCoin, would you care to comment about what you see as the weaknesses and drawbacks to it?
