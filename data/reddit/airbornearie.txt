Uhm, never thought about it like that. However, Rails Girls was started in 2009 (not by me) and has events all over the globe, all organized by enthusiastic volunteers (like myself). 
There isn't much _I_ can do about the name, but I'll be sure to pass your naming remark to the mailing list.

Rails Girls is a free one-day workshop for women (and men) to learn web programming with Ruby on Rails. 
I'm the organizer of Rails Girls Eindhoven. Normally an event like this would gather tens of sponsors to make it all happen. As far as I know I'm the first organizer to accept Bitcoin donations. 
So, head over to  check it out, and if you like what Rails Girls is doing, consider a small donation.
Edit: For those of you who are wondering where Eindhoven (Netherlands) is, here you go 
Feel free to use tipbot, I'll collect those funds as well. 
If there's any need for further proof (Coinbase shows my real name already), let me know how.

Wait? What? This has nothing to do with sexism. Rails Girls is aimed at women to make the step to technology very small indeed. Men are also welcome :-)

Bittish solves two problems when handling Bitcoin transactions on your website:
 1. Running a full Bitcoin node and having your private keys online.
 2. Let others handle _your_ Bitcoin.
Bittish uses HD Wallet addresses (using your extended public key) to create transactions (you can use our REST API to create new transactions). You'll get notified via webhook when the transaction when completed and confirmed. 
This means that with a few simple API calls and a webhook callback URL you can have Bitcoin payments and receive the Bitcoin directly on your own, privately and securely owned Bitcoin wallet.
