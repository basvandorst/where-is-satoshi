I agree. I'd add that fiat currency is backed by a government.

Bitcoin is not very similar to banking at all. 
The goal posts have been moved here. 
You were saying that we should somehow know inflation years from now, which makes no sense. Can you tell me the price of crypto next week? No. I can come miles closer with the value of a dollar.
I literally never said it was more transparent than crypto. I'm saying that the Fed is pretty damn transparent and puts out insane amounts of information regularly.

What can’t you find out about the banking system?

Its the worst system ever invented, except for every other system.

Choosing to compare a government body to software isn’t useful.
Their minutes are made public after a short period of time. They are audited a bunch of times from a bunch of entities every year. Congress can call the chair in for a grilling any time and divulge literally anything the committee demands of them. There are good reasons to shield the Fed from political pressure though, hence some structural insulation from politics. 
You ignored all of that. We know a lot more than a flow chart of function. They put out a ton of information. I’d bet you don’t know most of it, tbh.

If you are using inflation to mean an increase in the money supply, you are using an outdated and confusing model for a general rise in prices, which is what it means in economics. I think its a good idea to use the terms modern economists do when talking about economics.
You are defining transparency very narrowly. You are defining it as transparent or not transparent. Its a sliding scale. The truth is that the Fed has transparency built into its system. Go to their website. It has Congressional oversight and presidential appointed control. Congress and the President can "end the Fed" tomorrow if they want to.
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:43:17
Why would you expect to know that? That would make central banking useless. And how did you decide that's the standard for transparency, given all the more reasonable ways we think about transparency.
"Inflation" is an old and outdated term that isn't useful when discussing the Fed's activities. You should be more specific, like "increase in this part of this M or whatnot. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:32:43
We know some of that already.  The government has the power to regulate any of that. Any lack of transparency is elected leaders, not the central bank which is like every central bank. 
What is your understanding of the various kinds of information the fed puts out every year?
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:41:06
[Here go.]( Its updated pretty frequently. Its pretty hard to understand some of it without a background in the language being used and the concepts. Its a standard central bank, similar to those all around the world.
The notion that its impossible to figure out how it works is just bollocks. Central banking has existed all over the place for decades. It will require rolling up your sleeves and studying though.
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:36:15
That doesn't even make sense. Try doing some research. Maybe start with the act itself and learn it mandated tasks. Then you can look into how they do those things. You could even learned about money creation. Its almost like we know an insane amount about something you seem to consider unknowable.

Of course they will, but that's beside the point. If the CEO of overstock is so confident in bitcoin, keep you're money in bitcoin. Oh wait, it's in a bank. Get it?

QE isn't even inflationary. Check out the inflation since it began. Its nothing. All those gloomy predictions from folks terrified about QE have so far been completely wrong.
Are you aware that excess reserves is actually a new maintenance regime? 


It put a floor under a collapsing market, keeping people from fleeing their homes and causing the whole thing to spiral out of control. It was a masterstroke, actually.


Its very hard to see how swapping a bunch of bonds for reserves, mbs's and commercial paper could have done that. 
Ever heard of the phrase "never reason from a price change"? Do you know what it means?


More reasoning from a price change. Tsk tsk.
Who are these people that have been "left in the dust" and what does that even mean?

I guess I'm wondering if you will change your assumptions that led to the prediction. Most economists don't say what you are saying.

Nobody tells you what you consider money.

@_date: 2016-02-01 00:27:48


No one is that kind of rational. Seriously. No one.


I agree with that and try to live up to it as well. I've noticed that people with your assumptions tend to be resistant to changing those assumptions when shown to be wrong. 
For example, its been rather fashionable in certain circles to confidently predict a collapse in the dollar due to QE. For instance, we see this in "economists" like Peter Schiff. The argument goes something like this:
We are printing too much money. That will cause hyperinflation and currency collapse. If it doesn't happen, its because the printing itself is preventing the collapse. But this can't go on indefinitely, so  it will collapse. 
This leads to an unfalsifiable claim. If the currency collapses, its because I'm right (even though that's not necessarily true). If it doesn't, I'm still right, it just hasn't happened yet, but it will! 
As you can see, this is playing tennis without the net. Its impossible to be wrong. Well as Keynes said, in the long run we are all dead.

Because I've looked for and haven't found the data. I don't think it exists.and without that we are talking about politically motivated anecdotes.

That's from their wikipedia page. So we don't know if they are less safe in regards to that than cabs. I'm a data guy. Anything else is just a story fraught with bias. If you can show me the data, I'm listening.

Heh, you don't know what cognitive dissonance means either. Funny someone in this sub calling someone a conspiracy theorist for any reason, even moreso for asking for evidence you don't have and have never read.
