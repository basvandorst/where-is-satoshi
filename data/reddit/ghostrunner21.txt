Seems like everyone has a chart that makes it look like the next bull run is right around the corner...

Bitcoin is the grandfather.  It's not perfect but it started everything.  Blockchains that enable useful ways to transact within their ecosystem will be the future in my opinion.  That being said, Bitcoin has been around for so long, it very easily has the most credibility and trustworthiness, so it serves the functions that it needs to.

Well if moneymorning.com says it then it must be reliable.

True enough.  I have to say I respect his stance even if I disagree with it.  Someone as prolific as him has to take a side, and if he doesn't understand it, he has to stand against it.  Once utility is proven, I believe he will recant his stance though.  It's only a matter of time.

Simply put, bitcoin was suppossed to be used for people to send money back and forth to each other.  I think thats what the author is suggesting.  That being said, Satoshi was a visionary, and at the time of inception, his vision was revolutionary.  But as time passed the need to be able transfer money back and forth was filled by other cryptocurrencies.  
Is Bitcoin exactly what it was at its inception, and the years after?  No.  Is it revolutionary?  Is it important?  Has it changed the world for the better?  Has it paved the way for a new way for people to transact peer to peer without middlemen or governments to tell them how they can do it?  I think you can answer that.  To say that bitcoins vision has become perverted is a disservice to the vision of its creator in my opinion.  More than anything I think Satoshi wanted to innovate the way that people saw and were able to use money, and he achieved that on a grand scale.  And if he is still here I think he would be proud of what bitcoin has become.

Rat poison, eh.  At least he's original.  Coming from an artifact such as himself this is positive exposure.

If buying bitcoin is gambling then Im the house.

At this point yes he is.  Crypto is certainly not warraranted the market cap is has right now when you look at the actual usefulness of it.  Thats what I mean though, once the utility of crypto is proven, that will change things, in my opinion.

And this is relevant to bitcoin?

I would of given this an upvote if you spellchecked it before posting

Not that I know of, but I think what your doing sounds like a cool idea!  Perhaps someone with programming knowledge could design something for you?  Maybe not though.  I think the only way would be is if all your users accessing the private key used the same medium of entry.
In my opinion, this sounds like it could be possible, but quite expensive or cumbersome to facilitate.
What was your idea?
@_date: 2018-07-12 16:16:43
Right about where it is now.  6000~

While his entire premise is wrong, he makes some fair points about the faults of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin won't fail for many reasons but first and foremost being trust.  Bitcoin has withstood for over 10 years.  People have a greater ability to trust Bitcoin over the next shitcoin some devs throw together.
I used to think Bitcoin was doomed to fail as well so I don't think your stupid.  Your just wrong.  As I once was.
That being said I think Bitcoin will fail one day.  Technology will advance to the point that it is broken or something like that.  I don't know.  But my main point in this is that Bitcoin won't be replaced by another cryptocurrency.  An entirely new system will fill the void that bitcoin leaves one day.
