Because it would be something like me giving you $100 to go gambling at a casino. If you win any money you give me $100.10 back (1 day rate). It shouldn't be possible, and people certainly shouldn't be using BFX if it is.

Yes, I have an account. 


I admit to missing that part. Not sure if it would make things a whole lot better, from what I understand regulation is just even more "loose" on the BVI (could negatively impact credit speads).

Ah, a flash crash, that's an interesting case. In all other cases they should have their margin trigger high enough and provide insurance, but that of course won't help in a flash crash. Still, it's probably not even impacting the credit spreads. The probability is too low.
@_date: 2014-08-09 20:32:21
1) I rarely post my own articles (unless I have a very good reason to - I do in this case).
2) It does not include opinion at all. I carefully ruled this out. This is pure financial economics, I didn't make up the numbers nor the formulas. Economic sciences did.
3) 40-50% probability of default deserves some serious alarm. The only real misguidance is at BFX when they write "If you are not a trader and prefer safer investments, this feature is for you." This is BS, and somebody has to do something about it (at least inform the public).

Please note the difference between a swap and a loan, and the difference in exposures for these USD and BTC swaps. 
Second, what you're saying is that this is what we would like to call a "free lunch," and we should all be offering USD swaps on BFX. If prices are not right, then you're likely just getting scammed as a trader. As I noted in another comment:


BFX does take 15% of the interest rates, hence there would a good incentive for them to push these up (why don't they charge a fixed amount?). But again, just pointing out that this would be on the other side of the medal (the latter wouldn't be legitimate so it would be worse too), I don't have more information to show that this is happening, so I can only take the difference as a credit spread.

At the same time you seem to ignore arbitrage. If 50% implied default probability is indeed way too high, then you could earn a riskless profit on that. Maybe markets are not that efficient? Point taken, but 50%?

Bond-derived credit spreads are indeed different from real CDS spreads. But you seem to argue that these could differ by more than 20 or even 30% (only then the conclusion would change). At the same time you seem to provide some comparables that could provide an argument why this isn't likely.


They all happen to be Chinese too. If they offer similar products at similar rates, then perhaps Chinese companies are just risky counterparties? This is actually more likely to validate the market derived default probabilities, as they have comparable backgrounds.
@_date: 2014-08-09 21:12:17
Yeah I get your point, but I don't know what to make of it. If the risk ends up at the lender, then what is this place? An exchange where you can make leveraged bets with other people's money? I mean, seriously? That's not even a business model.
@_date: 2014-08-09 22:20:16
Good choice. I have not looked into OKCoin yet, don't know if any models can be applied as well.
@_date: 2014-08-09 17:34:31
Note that the numbers in the article would only be incorrect if market prices aren't "right." The problem is, markets are always right, unless there is some manipulation involved. If that would be the case, then there would be even more reason to avoid BFX. After all, it wouldn't be more than a scam-platform. I have no evidence that this (manipulation) is happening, just pointing out that it wouldn't improve the conclusion (also ***TL;DR***): putting money on BFX should be considered a very high-risk activity. Especially liquidity providers should be aware that by providing liquidity at BFX they are running a bigger risk than by buying into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-10 10:24:16


They write:


That goes beyond misleading. You're better off buying Bitcoins yourself. It's easy to show in numbers, and the intuition behind this is that then at least you're not covering somebody else's leveraged long position. Of course that is more risky than using the money to trade. Unless BFX covers all losses, then you just have credit exposure to BFX, which brings us back to credit spreads. But then credit risk on BFX can still shown to be more risky than holding Bitcoins anyway.
@_date: 2014-08-09 21:01:33
As with all financial investment risks, you want to be fairly compensated for the risks that you are taking. If there is a 3% chance that you will lose everything, you should be receiving 3% more in yield to compensate (compared to a risk-free rate). Above or below that point arbitrage opportunities will arise. If you would get 4% for 3% risk for example, that additional return would be riskless additional return. You can arbitrage it by going short a comparable loan anywhere in the market that receives 3%, and go long the 4%. The 4% will quickly be pulled down to the equilibrium point. It's kind of like gravity that pulls prices towards their fair equilibrium point. Hope this helps a bit.
@_date: 2014-08-10 15:14:25
No that is nonsense, because the trader has leverage and the lender does not. If a trader has $100 and lends $1100, he can leverage to a 2 BTC ($600 each) position. The lender would have 11 times more exposure to the same position (if he carries market risk for it, should the value suddenly drop below $1100).

If models wouldn't be true to some extend then they would not be used. A model is generally better than none.
You come at me telling me that decades of economic research is nothing but a nice "opinion" that I use for personal benefit. Are you kidding?
@_date: 2014-08-10 09:18:01


Mainly because I wanted to avoid making any more serious accusations for which I don't have the proper support (don't want to enter in a speculation game). If the prices a wrong then they likely inflated. But how would that lead to a better conclusion? No, then it would not indicate the probability of default, I can agree that much. That's why I already added a comment here to begin with. Especially given the 15% that BFX takes it raises a hunch that something not so legitimate might be another explanation (but I have no evidence for this).
Looking at our little comment history towards eachother we both seem very passionate, so maybe we should think along for a bit. What would you make of it? Even black swans can be rationalized in the end.
@_date: 2014-07-23 21:09:30
That statement is remarkable to say the least. In its current form, the proposal would prohibit (or hugely complicate) any kind of microfinancing from tipping to small ([peer-to-peer]( loans. The proposal is not even that bad, but some work is required on that awful overreaching definition of virtual currency business activity. Some more exemptions would make sense. I welcome regulation in general, and I can understand some over-inclusion, but being this far off is not giving me a lot of confidence that they fully understand the matter at hand.
@_date: 2014-07-27 16:26:53
Those that state we can simply ignore (potential) regulations are partially right, after all Bitcoin was designed to be untouchable. Unfortunately, that does not hold for businesses that are in any way involved with Bitcoin. They can and will be prosecuted if the NYDFS proposal becomes law in its current form. In other words, it could hurt the infrastructure and without that Bitcoin is still dead regardless of its design.
Of course, even if BitLicenses become law, it still has to be enforceable globally and/or be adopted globally. Otherwise it's just NY's problem really, and they will be shooting themselves in the foot with this crusade against Bitcoin. That's what it looks like anyway if you consider the [impact and their own statements with regard to that](
So no, we probably should not ignore it, but we should also realize that the more ridiculous the proposal is the less likely others are to follow. We should not miss the opportunity to point out what's wrong it.
@_date: 2014-08-09 21:22:36
If it's not insured than the exchange would be a joke; allowing leveraged bet's with other people's money..
How BFX manages it is up to them. They should have their margin trigger high enough, and be properly insured themselves against extreme liquidity crunches.
@_date: 2014-07-27 21:38:53
I tried to avoid that because it's kind of an extremely grey area. If it would become law, it is still to be seen to what extend it could be enforced (outside NY). What you're saying could be a possible outcome, it might not be. In any case that would probably be decided in court. I personally do not believe they will ever be able to enforce it all around the world (especially if a company does not have a hub in the U.S.), but that's just speculation.
@_date: 2014-08-09 20:19:16
If their systems cannot manage positions, how well can they manage overall security? They're not being very transparent about it in their terms either. But anyway, it's their system so still the same counterparty risk really.

My assumptions are what has been disclosed by BFX, does not seem weird to me. You blame me for their shortcomings.
@_date: 2014-08-10 10:06:18


I look at the economic substance of the deal. Calling a stock a bond would not make sense either, that does not make it so. In a total return swap, the lender would be required to pay a variable performance to the trader. In effect, all market and credit risk would be transferred from the trader to the lender. Conlusion: it's not a TRS. Looking at the content, it should be classified as a common loan. If you cannot do that either, then this would be a seriously messed up product that would allow the traders to make leveraged bets at the expense of other people's money (please keep that in mind).
Credit spreads can be derived from corporate bonds over Treasury yields. Can you compare these loans to corporate bonds? Yes, you can. By making this loan, you are exposing yourself to counterparty risk only. The counterparty is the exchange (unless they are offering a seriously flawed product), hence the additional spread should reflect this risk (your counterparty being BFX rather than the U.S. government).
So these are the options:
- This results in a ridiculous probability of default - avoid BFX
- They are offering flawed products and offer misguiding information on them - avoid BFX
- The rates are massively inflated in some kind of credit bubble (possibly involving manipulation by BFX itself) and you're getting ripped off as a trader - avoid BFX
@_date: 2014-08-10 14:40:04
If you include a market risk component (if you don't then it's just credit risk), then it leaves nothing of their claim that lending is less risky than trading (that's actually the case either way but whatever). What's worse, an exchange about to default or a deceptive exchange? I would personally not mind leveraged gambling with other people's money (which becomes the case if the lenders do carry market risk). Is that what lenders sign up for?
Of course we can expand a model for that, but that would come after the conclusion that something is wrong here. You're not making bad points at all, it would justify the spreads, but do you get my point as well?
@_date: 2014-08-09 19:50:17
Well, I hope it's not too disappointing, but the general formula is really nothing more than: Credit Spread (CS) = Probability of Default (PD) * Loss Given Default (PGD) which implies PD = CS / LGD
This is actually very intuitive, as you're putting your money in the hands of Bitfinex rather than in the hands of the U.S. government. The only difference is your counterparty. There is no market risk on the deal, just credit risk.
It's almost equal because the global economy has gone down the drain and Treasuries are at historic lows. Risk-free rates are negligible. The real question remains how much you will be able to recover, that's why I took two scenario's for recovery rates. One based on zero recovery and one based on ISDA standards.
Silly me, but writing this I realize I actually made a mistake in determining the default probability. It should be 40% at 100% LGD and over 50% at 75%. This might sound weird, but let's not forget the credit spread is a result of the default probability not the other way around.
@_date: 2014-08-09 20:36:26
You should take the LGD as a percentage. You get 2.7% / 100% or less, which results in 2.7%(+)
@_date: 2016-11-27 15:37:00
If you're assuming mining at the network level is roughly a zero sum game that doesn't mean someone that buys a $2,000 miner today is going to be making a loss on it by definition. Antminer S9 is highly profitable right now, and an investor could make a good return on it.
There's going to be a group running more efficient machines, and there's going to be a group running less efficient machines. The more efficient machines are an obvious group, if you're thinking about the less efficient machines you have to consider the Antminer S5+ for example, which runs at roughly my estimated average Watts per GH/s. Right now this rig is still profitable to run in China, so still in the efficient group. At least you should include this in the examples given. The Antminer S4 (at 0.7 Watts per GH/s) must really be reaching the end of its useful life right now (although potentially still profitable in some rare cases), but even that one will still be running if you have a rental contract of some sorts (it is hard to predict useful lifetime upfront). The latter miners will be part of the inefficient group. Then you also still have to consider hobbyists running the 21 Inc Bitcoin computer, and the miners willing to pay a little premium for getting Bitcoin anonymously, etc.
@_date: 2016-11-27 21:03:49
You're probably not someone who invests in cloud mining and other (often) shady services (also including Auroracoin, Onecoin, etc.) ;) Especially over the last year I've been exposing many of these scams, as a contribution to keeping the Bitcoin ecosystem as clean as possible. :)
@_date: 2016-11-28 19:23:40
Shocking... I just published my [Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index]( based on the assumption of 6 cents per KWh. If energy is near-free, you can run almost any inefficient machine. My estimate would be way off and the Bitcoin network could be consuming as much energy as Portugal rather than Panama - and it's not like there's much of a choice if you're in Venezuela right now. In short, a humanitatian and ecological disaster combined. Maybe it's time to raise some funds to Venezuela?
@_date: 2016-11-27 20:51:40
I avoided calling it "wasted" energy because I do realize that it is required "waste" in PoW. Even so, it's a (too) high price to pay for consensus. If energy consumption per transaction is almost equal to the power requirement of 3 US households (for 1 day), it should be abandoned long-term (on way or another). I'm still hoping for a better solution. :)
@_date: 2016-11-27 08:30:52
I personally would like Bitcoin and other current PoW algos to be future-ready. If the energy consumption per TX equals that of almost 3 US households (for 1 day), that's absolutely not the case. It's unsustainable, and we should aim for something better. Now I'm not a big PoS fan, and I know it's easier said than done, but seriously this is important. So that's why I also added it should "not be seen as an attempt to discourage the use of Bitcoin". As you quoted, I'm hoping this will serve as a reminder for those working on cleaner alternatives that their work is most valuable and much needed.
@_date: 2016-12-19 21:23:05
So, this article was one of the things that actually inspired me to create an [energy consumption index]( for Bitcoin. Looking at this, you'll find that the energy consumption today is way worse (in just a little over a year). Total energy consumption is now around 9 TWh per year, almost equal to Guatemala (in total). Per transaction this is 89 KWh, that enough to power 3 U.S. households for 1 day (compared to 1.57 mentioned in this article). You can debate parameters for this calculation, but the outcome will be extreme regardless (so yes, there is a truth to it). Just think about it; 3 U.S. households per transaction? Is there any way you could label that as sustainable? One important thing is, however, that **it's proof-of-work that is unsustainable, not necessarily Bitcoin**. Also note that it's not all "wasted" energy; it's just the way proof-of-work ensures consensus. Bitcoin does need a new consensus algorithm that uses a lot less energy to be ready for the future (among other things). The good news is, people are working on that, and new developments in proof-of-stake provide hope that a breakthrough may be within reach (although there is no guarantee at the moment). For now, the only way to compensate for your BTC transaction is by not using any energy at all for three days. Good luck!
@_date: 2016-11-27 20:11:41
I like the idea of being able to tweak some of the assumptions. I won't be able to add this short-term, but it's going on my wish-list :) I'd probably focus more on where miners are located. Energy rates can vary quite a bit between countries, and paying 6, 5 or even 4 cents per KWh on average can make a huge difference on profitability (which ultimately determines what miners are viable).
@_date: 2016-11-27 08:20:30
Hi there!
Thank you for taking the time to do some verification! I do think some of the parameters are debatable (you cannot escape having to make some assumptions), hence I did include a "key assumptions" section. Regarding the Watts per GH/s I'm well aware of the S9 (and even S7) being more efficient. It would, however, be a mistake to think that the network is run by these machines only. So here's what's included in the key assumptions: "For the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index it is assumed that the average amount of Watts consumed per GH/s is equal to the amount of Watts that can be afforded by mining revenues per GH/s." I think this is a fair measure to account for the more inefficient machines still running on the network. Doing so you get to 0.461W per GH/s (this figure is included in the key statistics) based on the second assumption of an average price of "6 cents per KWh". I know this is low for the US, but in other regions it certainly isn't unrealistic. I personally feel like this is still a bit high.
I would very much like to hear how I can better point out these key assumptions, or how to explain them better if you did have a look at them. Again, your feedback is very appreciated!
@_date: 2016-11-27 20:29:57
Only these are quite recent machines that are still profitable (especially the S5+). When it comes to older miners, there's no reason to turn them off while they still return a profit. The S5+ delivers 7,722 GH/s at 3,436W. On a total hashrate of 1,873,438 TH/s 242,610 units could fit in the Bitcoin network.  Multiplying that with 3,436W is 20 GW/day; less than 9% below my estimate. 
By the way, regarding retirement...


I am taking this into account, as my model will show decreasing GWh per day as hashrate increases on a flat price (so increasing efficiency).  I totally agree this is a very important part of accurately modelling power consumption.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:40:00
Ok, here’s a tip: DON’T BE GREEDY
Congratulations, you’ve made a return of 30,000%. You want a 100,000%? Or a million %? It would be pretty sound financial planning to cash out half and leave the rest. That should be more than enough to make the rest of your life quite a bit easier, and you can still make $10 million w/e with the rest of your BTC. (Effectively hedging your regret if the Bitcoin bubble happens to burst).
@_date: 2016-02-15 19:58:22
Even if developers *could* be forced to register with FinCEN, it still wouldn't be very relevant. Let's try not to forget that **Bitcoin is immune to any form of government control** by nature. Bitcoin developers could certainly be affected personally (which may potentially result in a big short-term loss for Bitcoin in terms of experience and knowledge), but the worst that could happen to Bitcoin long-term is that development gets delayed. New anonymous developers like Satoshi would likely appear on stage, and Bitcoin would continue to evolve in the long run.
@_date: 2016-07-28 07:29:57
Are there so many miners in Washington state? It's going to have an effect for sure, but I don't think they make up 8% of the total hashrate?
@_date: 2016-07-28 13:20:58
Well of course, that's why I wrote "some improvement". The weather in at least the US should be getting some relief soon, so if weather plays a big enough role in the current trend then that should probably be noticable. I doubt weather will explain the full 8% loss though. Consider the significant portion of miners in China; the weather has been pretty consistent (hot) over there - still we recently hit an all-time high anyway.
@_date: 2016-07-28 07:56:23

Still somewhat surprised by the timing in that case. 8% of hash isn't one or two miners. Wondering what would make them all shut down now at about the same. If you're waiting, then why jump when things get a bit better (some other miners shutting down). Would wait a bit longer then? Had me thinking I must be missing something.
@_date: 2016-07-28 10:06:28
Ah, that explains a lot! Too bad everyone loses their sense of humor. I could appreciate the joke more :)
@_date: 2016-07-21 11:41:25
Oh, in this case it received 5x 1 BTC (person A, B, C, D and E) in the example. Sorry if that wasn't clear (made an edit to clarify). The 4 BTC loan (to person F) is provided from those 5 BTC held (fractional reserve relies on not everyone withdrawing at the same time).
@_date: 2016-07-21 07:35:53
Technically Bitcoin doesn't prevent fractional reserves. Suppose person A, B, C, D and E all put 1 BTC in Bitcoin bank R (so bank R holds 5 * 1 BTC in total). Nothing prevents bank R from providing a 4 BTC loan to person F. It would then have a remaining (fractional) reserve of 1 BTC (a better reserve ratio than most fiat banks by the way).
In reality nobody with the right mind would apply for such a loan (except for speculative or hedging purposes). This is because Bitcoin is a deflationary currency, while most people don't have a deflationary income. In other words, you expect the value of your loan to increase in fiat terms - not a very positive outlook.
So it discourages the loan-takers mainly, and it gets worse. Loans typically have some default rate, which is probably already going to be higher than normal due to the previous point of debt rising vs fiat income. Result: interest rates will have to be high for the Bitcoin banks to mitigate this risk. Overall it's very unattractive for loan-takers, and probably too risky from a bank-perspective (if you cannot get a bail-out that is).
@_date: 2016-07-28 13:31:41
Interesting read. The BTC network lost about 120 PH/s. These containers do 4-18 PH/s each, so they would have been testing 7-30 containers. The default is 4 PH/s, but even around 20 (assuming some stressing or at least a few maxed ones) of those containers seems a bit much for a test?
I also checked the BitFury Pool history, but it seems to look quite steady for the past months: 
It might still be them, but that many containers for that long wouldn't really classify as a test run IMO.
