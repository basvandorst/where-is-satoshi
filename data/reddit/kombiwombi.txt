It obviously depends on the distribution of the loss. If you have lost all your assets it really doesn't matter that the system still exists.

Why do you think an action in New York will have relevant jurisdiction. As opposed to an action in Tokyo?

But there are no assets beyond Mt Gox's goodwill. And that's possibly a negative. You can expect Japanese creditors and employees to paint BTC holders as partners in a speculative scheme, and thus real property and employee creditors should take precedence. In short, don't hold your breath if you are a offshore BTC debtor.

"Illegal" is an interesting word. Consider that most holders of bitcoin haven't paid tax on the capital gains on their asset. Or that most bitcoin transactions ignore transaction reporting laws. In short, bitcoin is legal, but most holders of it are not obeying the laws of the country they are operating in.

Statements from government departments do not make decisions for issues beyond the responsibility of that department. So Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs are not going to make a determination on non-tax non-customs issues.

Why would he move from Japan at the moment? The Japanese authorities are only vaguely interested in a fraud which hasn't  affected their own citizens. They're probably more upset that staff weren't paid off properly when the firm folded.
Whereas he'd likely be arrested within days of setting foot in the US.
