Good article. I read some stuff about EDA before but was lacking parts of the picture.

So Ether isn't a valid chain?

I would have expected it to dump by now if people were trying to make a quick buck. They've already seen 2-3X return if they bought after the initial crash.

What does "longest valid chain" mean? In what way is Bitcoin cash not valid? Not criticizing, just asking.

What ever happened to BCC failing? It's above $600 now, around where it was when the fork happened (and more than 2X where it was after the initial crash).

I sold it all around the peak yesterday. Maybe I'll rebuy later from one of you guys.

IDK where I can open a short position if I ignore the exchanges that are sketchy, have been majorly hacked in the past, or are based in Russia or China... which is most of them.

So... I sold all my BTC.

Unless you're truly an expert, don't act like you know how to secure and back up your phone better than a huge corporation knows how to secure and back up a website. They have servers running nothing but their site and very few ways in. Your phone is running all kinds of crap, even if it's iOS (and esp. if Android). And you can lose your phone. And to back up your phone, you have to secure the backup equally.

And how much have people lost accidentally deleting BTC stored locally or getting hacked? You're being paranoid. If people have to hold their own coins (and study up a lot to do so) and can't even trust the equivalent of their stock broker, BTC oughtta fail.
