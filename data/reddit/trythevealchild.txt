Let's not go on a witchhunt, but Newsweek needs to know that this kind of unprofessional journalism is unacceptable. Just look at some of the twitter accounts posted below. They gloat, saying there's "no doubt" about Satoshi's identity, saying "that's how investigative journalism is done!", etc. It's ridiculous. Here are some ways you can get in touch with them and provide feedback.

Twitter for Kira Bindrim, managing editor of Newsweek - [
Twitter for Leah McGrath, writer of the Satoshi article - [

edit: for fuck's sake, they're [doubling down and standing by the story]( This is absurd.

No, that's not the case. At any racetrack, the odds are always in flux right up until the race begins. It doesn't matter when you placed your bet, it gets locked in at the odds when the race starts.

Except she's doing it the way tabloids sell issues, not the way journalists do it. Maybe Newsweek is fine with that, but they shouldn't be if they hope to be taken seriously.

This is the problem right here. She *doesn't* know this. If she had evidence that backed up her statement that Dorian = Satoshi, she would have provided it.
If Dorian really said "I'm no longer involved in that. It's been turned over to other people", I can see why she'd reach the conclusion that she reached. But *there is still no evidence*, and yet when confronted with this point, Leah keeps saying "It's not about proving he is Satoshi, it's about trying to prove he isn't, and I can't." That shows a fundamental misunderstanding about what her role is here.
If she posted a story about him *possibly* being Satoshi, that would be a different story, but her insistence that he's *definitely* Satoshi despite having no real evidence is what people have a major problem with.

I'm with you. I didn't mean to imply you were calling for a witchhunt. I put that there so hopefully the message we give to Newsweak is critical feedback, not "LEAH MUST BE FIRED", though she should be after this fiasco.
