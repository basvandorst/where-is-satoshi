Because he considers his opinions 'better' than others.
@_date: 2014-11-01 19:20:32
Thats not even close to true or relevant. Only increase in % is relevant since technology improvement accounts for the hash-rate availability, anything else is pointless to look at. There is also no "leaving the plateau" since the nature of mining is that new deployment and increase in hash rate is naturally followed by decommission of non profitable hardware shortly after.

@_date: 2014-12-04 03:41:06
You are of course correct, but you have to admit that for the uninformed trader shorting means a greater risk of losing your capital over a longer time horizon (when investing in blue chip/F500 at least) as you do not own an asset but rather borrow one to sell it and buy back cheaper.  I would also argue that semantically investing means buying shares in a company to allow them capital for expansion etc. While shorting is speculating on underperformance or declining market conditions. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 00:07:34
I doubt that just the coins going anywhere would cause that much of a panic. I think it would be pretty cool :)
@_date: 2014-11-16 17:29:12
Well I also think that people are mixing scams and failures wildly in a way that actually hurts the ecosystem. Just because they happen to lose a few BTC having invested in a company that goes bankrupt does not mean its a scam. Companies go tits up every day. Some in the ecosystem are scams, some have bad luck, some gets hacked and some just are bad ideas. Its nothing unnatural or strange. The fact that a bunch of immature teens invested BTC just makes them want think "it was a scam" because they don't want to admit they made a bad investment.

I don't completely disagree, but in all honesty I don't see why most of the core devs wouldn't continue working even without direct salary. Quite a few of them (the vast majority) hold enough Bitcoon to virtually never have to work again, and many more have exceptionally lucrative consulting careers, making their "pro bono" blockchain work a great resume filler.

Bitcoin is a community developed open source project whose functionality allows Counterparty and Mastercoin to store data in the blockchain. If the community or core devs wants to disallow this they could easily fork to close this functionality. It is definitely not up to a single programmer to make this decision on his own and speak on behalf of anyone or claim to 'know better'. Mastercoin is also working to move to factom which would solve the bloat issue.

I personally think that VERY few companies or projects in the Bitcoin ecosystem were started with the intention of being scams. The fact that million dollar projects are run by 20 year olds spending other peoples money just lends itself to spectacular failures. Hell, I don't even think moolah was a straight up scam. It just became one once the founder dug himself a big enough hole. I'd they actually would have been successful, there would have been no incentive to scam anyone. 
Edit. Mtgox was not a scam. Just rampant incompetence and bad leadership.

I would argue that we as a community haven't even scratched the surface of what can be done on the Bitcoin ecosystem but still 100s of people are launching alt coins that solve nonexistent problems just to make a quick buck.

Profitability has nothing to do with it, actually mining however. They were a long con that just like all others went bust when people stopped putting fresh money in. If they had mining hardware to cover all the hash rate sold you would have gotten the product ordered profitable or not.  There is still plenty of profit in mining if you do it right.

I am simply pointing out that if a company sells equipment at a see price per slice of access (a price they profit off over time) and the customer buys this slice its no different than any other form of hardware rental. Cloud mining companies being unethical or underfunded is no different than any other business caring shady. Bitmain for example is one company I would consider likely to be legitimate, and the 500 TH project worked out just fine. TLDR; nothing about the practice of cloud mining itself is a ponzi scheme, its the companies we have seen "so far" that are unethical or stupid.

I'm fine with this, IF the coins are sold at a very heft market premium. Its only 200 BTC but its a question of trust. Either that, or hold a closed sale for original investors somehow. There are smarter ways of doing this.

You miss the point. There is a huge interest in Bitcoin mining in the third world BECAUSE they don't care about ROI. Being able to transact outside the system is so much more valuable that they are willing to mine at a significant net loss.

There is absolutely no reason for them to. Actually, there is heavy incentive not to cash out for a long time just based on media/attention and taking the time to tumble the coin properly. Best guess would be that they cash our a few $100k via localbitcoins or spread across a few exchanges with lax security (BTCe) and sit on the rest for as long as they can.

Understood, but couldn't you just take on venture capital and charge per installation or simply using bitcoin as payment method (since you already utilize the blockchain for archiving hashes)? What is the "gain" of using the crowdsale model outside of the founders not having to dilute ownership? I'm sorry if I come off as hostile but it seems every company in crypro these days print their own money by issuing their own "coin" backed by just the idea that the free market somehow will value them based on service usage, without really clarifying the model behind the usage or valuation.

Looking at the hot-wallet it seems exceptionally unlikely any really major amount was stolen. 43k BTC was total influx over several months, I would venture that less than 5k was absconded with.
@_date: 2015-03-19 14:13:42

Do you even know how Bitcoin works? Their hot wallet shows a total influx/output of 43k BTC over 6 months. That was the moving capital of the operation. Out of that maybe 3k disappeared. The rest (127,000 BTC) were in escrow accounts. Are you seriously assuming that a single dark market had a turnover of $60,000,000 a week? I hope not.

Of course there is such a point. I am just making the argument that in this case it very much seems that that is not even close to the case for the merchants. $35 million is an astronomical sum compared to the gross of the trade and I am betting many hundreds (at least) merchants are absolutely gutted by the theft. This  makes the sums they trusted a bunch of anonymous thrives with outrageously stupid, especially in night of this being at least the 4th major black market to go under taking funds with them in one way or another.

Sure, my point is still that 130k BTC is an idiot sum for even 1000s of vendors (maybe a few 100 really actice) to have on a central platform, especially with slow/frozen withdrawals for a damn week.

@_date: 2015-03-19 14:18:11
Yes I am sure the reason the vendors are so angry is that $35 million was just 1/1000th of their profits. I will gladly believe that they made $35 BILLION before it went bust.. (And moved 20 x every Bitcoin in existence). You seem kind of slow in the head.

How is it false? In heads up games you can feel pretty safe a long as you trust the software (then again there has been several examples of that being a bad idea. Absolute poker being one). In ANY ring game, at for example seals with clubs though, collusion is completely out of control.

No. With the halving of the reward coming soon mining as an incentive is not a viable idea. Sponsored nodes, hardware wallets etc. Is the key. I could be wrong but I doubt mining products is what 21  inc are out to capitalize on.

Isn't the sale of tokens just a "no cost" way money grab? There is no reason (outside the love of money) for the tokens to have value if they do not represent actual ownership? Feel free to correct me but nothing stops factom from just issuing more tokens whenever they feel like it? They hold no real value outside of usability that could be free of charge if (which I assume) factom charges customers (users of the service) a fee for integration and use. Am I misunderstanding this or isnt it just another "coin ICO" under a different name?

Hey scammer! How about you bone up on your math a little. 1/12th isn't quite 50% last time I checked. Its also a hell of a lot less then 98%. Also, I hope you are joking.. Do you think 1 million coins per year will keep quark alive? Check the number of coins in existence and then browse the founders and preminers wallets for some reality check. The 98% owners are dumping all their coins to the newcomers being scammed.. Rich gets richer and lots of small buyers go broke.

They already lost. Taping out 28nm in late Jan means chips in late March at the earliest and mining equipment in mid-April. At that time competition will be selling their late wafers and taking out 18-16nm. 
They have also taken development costs by selling Bitcoin around $100 further depreciating the asset. I'm my view, AM is still overvalued by a factor of 3-5x
Also, why are they calling it 'Gen 3'? It'd their generation 2 chips. The fact that they failed to deliver one entire generation does not change that fact.
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:25:17

@_date: 2013-12-19 19:33:35
Agreed. In this case it means that the currency itself is designed for the very purpose of allowing a very small group to very quickly mine the vast majority of the currency. 
Quark is 100% doomed based on the fact that with only 2% of coins left to be mined and virtually zero transaction fees or adoption the block reward will expire before it has a chance to become an accepted currency leaving no reward for miners and the block chain will cease to propagate as miners leave the network. 
100% pump and dump scam. The end

I would argue that you didn't "work on" reddit because you posted here if that's what you are asking. I think the definition is even clearer with Quark.

I don't even know where to start. The very notion that over 90% premine isn't bad is just laughable and essentially a death sentence doe any currency. And then of course we have the old "asic proof" argument which of course is just dumb. A CPU only coin (as the case with quark) is crazy easy to 51% attack with a medium sized botnet and of course the way it was premined as well. Not to mention that this "BTC developer" nonsense is a load of crap and everyone knows it.

You obviously have no fucking clue as to what you are talking about. Dogecoin is a 100% joke conjured up by /b and a few copy pasta kids at bitcointalk. It is a practical joke to make fun of altcoins that somehow got popular enough to have actual value. Joke of course being totally obvious and just a way to hide the fact that the developers are actually using it to get rich. Pretty funny though.

I dont think you understand trading legislation. If you are a major holder of a financial instrument and conspire with others to use your positions to drive price that is illegal indeed and you can go to big boy prison.
