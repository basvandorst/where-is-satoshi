Allready exists, its what I bought my pizza with today it's called bitcoin with some money related word behind it, like the kind you can spend without intermediary... Hmm what's the word... Starts with a C... 
@_date: 2014-05-30 21:49:02
yeah over here in belgium bancontact mistercash (in belgium market leader when it comes to payment cards) is pushing their new app &amp; payment system that's suspiciously similar to the bitcoin pos solutions (using qr codes etc) apart from the obvious fact it is still linked to your bank account and the regular fees are still in place.
check their site to see what i'm talking about: 
and promovids: 
the app -&gt; 
one of the pos providers -&gt;

yeah it's best to just set up your own webshop &amp; if they want to pay with bitcoin direct them there with the explanation that ebay doesn't allow it.

meh takeaway.com (here pizza.be) is waay more popular and has a lot more restaurants then just-eat (here just-eat.be) anyway, and  as said they do accept bitcoin :D

in the mail i got the file was hosted on a catholic school website in friesland
    goo.gl/sFgbEJ pointing to skodegouw.nl/web/includes/Backup.zip
i called them &amp; they just took it down :D .
did anyone get mails having it hosted elsewhere ?
@_date: 2014-05-25 16:14:47
i was wondering how long it would take to see this method here :), i like to do the same but with cheap chinese ones (20 or so for approx €10/$14 total) (talking bout the keyrings not the tf cards ofc)
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:09:59
too bad you cant use em for other services :(
@_date: 2014-04-01 08:22:01


just throw it in any qr gen :)
you can get some software for this including opensource, 
or just use a site like [goqr.me](

@ hi i allready have a Gen 1 card of you wich i'm verry happy with &amp;it's a lot better quality and sturdier then my debit cards :)
but i was wondering if it would be possible for me to just send you my public adress and bip38 encrypted adress instead of going through the whole 2factor thing ? mainly because i'd love to be able to use a vanity adress ^_^, looking forward to your reply.
o yeah and also the ability to order multiple identical ones :)
@_date: 2014-01-07 12:18:26
hmm it was down when i posted this guess i'll give em another call ...
if it doesn't get removed i'm going to assume one of either their staff is responsible or there is indeed another backdoor.
***update*** well the lady @ the phone told me he was no longer available and asked if i wanted to leave a message after explaining everything to her she quite rudely threw down the horn ...
any authority or anything i can call ?
***update 2*** called their hosting provider, now they took it down,
i also sent them a copy of the phishing mail &amp; further info + link to this and a few other threads.
@_date: 2014-01-07 14:50:51


ok so i've called the admin of the site hosting the file, they removed it &amp; an hour later it reappeared, i called again &amp; he's no longer available &amp; i get hung up on.
so i contacted their hosting provider (both on the phone &amp; via an email) &amp; they removed the file.
(sorry but it's in dutch)


	


		














however it still seems to reappear now &amp; then.
i've also left a message to google's goo.gl spam support to get the shortened url removed.
@_date: 2014-02-09 22:29:17
no need to be rude ... he didn't put it up ...
besides it can easily be [bypassed](
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:17:09
i doubt he'd be using windows, and would've probably received multiple of these now ...
@_date: 2014-01-07 08:46:15
actually no, that's the first thing i wanted to do but mailing back bounced, then i forwarded it to without checking the files thinking i was being an honest bitcoiner :(
[but yeah i can see your reasoning.](
@_date: 2014-01-07 08:37:49
yeah it caught me offguard, and trying to be an honest bitcoiner i actually just forwarded it to without checking the files :(
@_date: 2014-11-25 05:31:10
didn't see your first post but would've suggested contacting the [bba]( they do a great job representing us over here and would've helped you optimize your article :) oh and make sure to visit some of the meetup groups (wichever is closest) :p

i love it but cant seem able to implement it :( 
could you give me an example line like font awesome does [here]( ?
(i placed the contents of the folder in mydomain.com/public_html/fonts and the header line is made accordingly :

@_date: 2014-01-07 08:30:51
Oh shit, i haven't seen this before,
i got it yesterday (didn't get a warning on gmail) 
and thought someone just sent it to the wrong adress,
guessing that by david they meant (who does wallet recovery)
i forwarded it to him without even looking at the files :( 
so sorry dave, i was trying to be an honest bitcoiner.
@_date: 2014-03-13 23:10:06
Ooh keep me posted, ps make sure to also send it to Belgium :D
as half the country speaks dutch (my half tyvm) the other have does french &amp; the big city centers are a mix of both+english .
i'd love to share these babies @ our bitcoin meetup :D
@_date: 2014-08-01 22:05:14
awesome, thanks for sharing man ^_^
@_date: 2014-02-09 22:27:14
it can also easily be [bypassed]( so you can properly read the article aswell :)
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:33:53
i dont think you can upload that amount of data to virustotal, but others have scanned all the executables as clear &amp; i've scanned all files with avast! , malwarebytes &amp; sophos, i also checked for alternative data streams (do those even work in a zip/after extraction ?) all clear, that said, if there would be something there it might just still be something that's undetectable at the moment, so if you want to run any exe's best to do so on a vm on a seperate computer ... better safe then sorrow ... 
*update* DO NOT run the exe's [they contain malware that steals bitcoin-qt wallets]( just check the database files with appropriate software or on google docs or something
@_date: 2014-09-22 22:17:34

@_date: 2018-10-19 04:46:21
Because it was suppose to be the currency for the world that you could spend anywhere, with little to no transaction fees, no banks, institutions  or government that could take it from you &amp; no inflation decreasing the value by printing more.
Unfortunately that dream will never come true for btc now :(
@_date: 2018-10-19 16:59:19
Well because btc is no longer cheap to use, and there's barely development of btc, as devs are working on side chains instead. And those are cheap but no longer completely decentralised or without middlemen. And adoption has actually gone down.
I used to be part of a couple of Bitcoin meetup groups and we worked hard on getting merchant adoption.
In Belgium we had projects like gent bitcoin city etc with a lot of merchants accepting bitcoin, none of them do anymore.
Not only that the general narrative coming from the lead devs went from get btc accepted everywhere to "use a credit card" like what the actual fuck?
It's truly sad :(
Hope that helped 
@_date: 2018-04-05 09:17:26
Don't know if it is now, but it wasn't back in 2013, I used to go to plenty of Bitcoin meetups with among them a international tax lawyer Thomas Spaans who founded the bba (Belgian Bitcoin Association) to represent crypto users interests when it comes to new regulations. (also look up his old Ted talk on bitcoin)
And a lot of people from our 2013 meetups went on to run crypto based buisnesses.
Like most early bitcoin adopters that fell in love with what bitcoin stood for i have however ended up on the other side of the fork (the one staying true to the whitepaper). 
@_date: 2015-03-18 12:08:03

@_date: 2013-11-14 13:03:55
how would this negatively effect the security? as both of them would have a naked adress just that you only find out the one that's allready BIP38 encrypted, after you decrypt it but once that adress is know it can be used and is just a normal naked adress.
but to give a example of what i'd like to do is BIP38 protect the private key of a newly generated vanity wallet
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:56:41

glad you liked it,
and you wont be dissapointed visiting our magical land of fries, beer, chocolate &amp; waffles.
that said tho the before mentioned divide etc brings a bunch of problems with it politically one of wich being sometimes completely different rules &amp; regulations, and a lot of tax money flowing one way (from Flanders to Wallonia) wich has been one of the major points of the rightwing parties in Flanders.
There was also the whole splicing of BHV thing that didn't get sorten (and was the reason why we didnt have a government for so long) [err you know what this probably explains it better then i ever could](

It is, i think most people &lt;40yo at least somewhat understand English (due to the fact that most tv-shows are from the US and over here things get subbed instead of dubbed, so you pretty much automatically learn English, and in most cases you get English starting your 3rd year of college.) and most people will try their hardest to help you :)

both belgium is multilingual, the upper half (Flanders) speaks dutch (flemish). the bottom part (Wallonia) speaks french (walloon).
they also have completely different cultures, a different mentality &amp; different politics.
flemish differs from dutch &amp; walloon differs from french sorta like UK english differs from US english, so a dutch guy &amp; a flemish guy wil understand eachother but some words are different, some sayings are different, sometimes the same word gets a different meaning all together, a verry childish example would be the term "poepen" wich in most flemish(BE) parts would be a slang term understood as fucking while in dutch (NL) it means taking a dump.
there's also a german speaking part of belgium.
and finally there's the capital brussels wich is located in the flemish half but where they mainly speak french/walloon .
