I'd be interested to know if any verified US customers had their BTC taken. I know they changed their TOS after the recent CFTC citation and stated that verified US customers would receive one of the 3 keys themselves, and bitfinex would have one and bitgo would have one. If it was just BFX's key that was compromised, then they probably got *everything* but the BTC from verified US customers. I know the bitgo situation *does* open them up to some risks beyond the normal hot/cold method, but in this case, *if* verified US customers didn't get their funds stolen, then I'd say it worked (in this case). I know it opened up everyone else - not my point. Point was BFX should have never had two keys themselves anyways.
Can any verified US customers (that received their key from bitgo/bfx per their new TOS) on BFX confirm that their bitcoin has been stolen?

Some people, like[ this guy]( did everything right and *still* got boned. He only transferred to BFX to sell (after keeping everything in cold storage for years), and within 12 hours his bitcoin were gone.

No, but in most cases in the financial world, you would be required to report your trades, report your affiliations, you'd be under a financial microscope from the SEC or other regulatory authority, and would possibly be restricted from trading at certain times (like during bankruptcy proceedings or upon court order because of a lawsuit, or etc). Nothing wrong with that. It doesn't need to be black and white. No one is saying you or PGP shouldn't be allowed to use or trade or even sell bitcoin. But there's no transparency. Just you saying he can't "trade", and that his account is monitored by you all. But... who watches the watchmen? Not to make an accusation, but *if* the whole of BFX was corrupt, then you saying that "everyone watches everyone be corrupt" doesn't really mean anything.
Also, stop saying he can't "trade", but can "adjust his position". 6 in one hand, half dozen in the other. If he "adjusts his position" more than once every month or two, he's trading. I guarantee you he does. But wait, we don't know because... no transparency. I can't see when he bought/sold bitcoin, because he doesn't need to file it with the SEC. Any other executive in his position in a regulated financial company in the USA would have their stock activity under a microscope. All I'm saying is at some point the excuses need to stop.

Holy crap, so this *really* only leaves both *bitfinex* AND *bitgo's* keys being the culprit. Perhaps this is why Kraken recently disabled withdrawals? Damn.... sorry this happened to you, brother.

You as well. You're remarkably well composed for someone who just had the *utmost* worst thing possible happen.

That was great to watch. A little misinformation here and there but nothing too damaging. Biggest flaw was them calling GBTC an ETF. If a *real* bitcoin ETF launched it would trade at *much* higher volumes than GBTC. GBTC is illiquid because there aren't new shares created (i.e. bitcoins acquired) when capital flows in to the "fund", and there are only so many people willing to pay the premium it trades at to have pseudo-btc exposure in tax advantaged accounts. GBTC is really just a holding company that holds x bitcoin, issued x shares who's NAV representing "~1/10 of x bitcoin each", but it's so illiquid because it's AUM is fixed in terms of bitcoin (AFAIK). ETF's have to acquire more shares of the underlying upon capital inflows to the fund, which creates buying pressure on the underlying. That's why / how the *real* bitcoin ETF will really cause things to heat up.
TastyTrade has a *lot* of followers, and I bet this had them perking up their ears.

Bingo. What an excellent talk. Strangely enough I was having almost this exact talk with myself in the shower this morning, at least, on the topic of how things grow to their capacity, and force that capacity to increase, then grow to capacity, and etc, over and over in many aspects of life. And it's that growth to capacity that even allows the progression and evolution to get to a point where you can do more and more interesting things with it. People act like bitcoin needs to be able to do the volume of Visa in it's current state. To use an analogy Andreas used, that would be like asking the internet of 1992 to run Netflix. The demand isn't there to begin with so of course the technology hasn't grown to that point yet.

What if coinbase partnered with a financial firm to procure and store the BTC for an ETF? I know we've all talked about the winklevoss ETF for years, but wouldn't it make sense for others to pursue that avenue, too? No one's talked about that for a while now. That would come out of nowhere and be *huge* fucking news.

Fuck off with that noise. If we can't allow large money traders what's the point. There's nothing suspicious about someone just because they're wealthy. I've spent $200k with coinbase purchasing BTC over the years and had zero fucking issues. Do you think TDA calls the internet cops when I purchase $100k worth of stocks? I take offense to you suggesting criminalizing someone just because their wealth and/or tolerance for risk is higher than yours. Not everyone trades bitcoin with their pocket money and if it's going to grow at *any* rate from here we need to support and encourage the inflow of wealth towards the bitcoin space, not discourage it.

What you don't seem to understand is that ASIC's are now at 16nm. There's not going to be any more 10x or 100x speed improvements like there were on the way down to 16nm. ASIC's are now using the most advanced wafer technologies and their development will therefore slow dramatically for the next few years. This also means no more giant increases in difficulty that casue previous investments to become massively unprofitable, because ASIC manufacturers are no longer going to be turing on new generations of chips every 4-6 months. Mining will stabilize dramatically over the next few years. That's why anyone buying a *current* generation miner that has cheap enough electricity should and will run it for at least the next few years until we move to 12nm/10nm.

A summary (from the link above):
"Over a year ago, an anonymous source contacted the Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) and submitted encrypted internal documents from Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm that sells anonymous offshore companies around the world. These shell firms enable their owners to cover up their business dealings, no matter how shady.
In the months that followed, the number of documents continued to grow far beyond the original leak. Ultimately, SZ acquired about 2.6 terabytes of data, making the leak the biggest that journalists had ever worked with. The source wanted neither financial compensation nor anything else in return, apart from a few security measures.
The data provides rare insights into a world that can only exist in the shadows. It proves how a global industry led by major banks, legal firms, and asset management companies secretly manages the estates of the world’s rich and famous: from politicians, Fifa officials, fraudsters and drug smugglers, to celebrities and professional athletes."

Which... I'm sorry... is bullshit.
I'm actually of the belief that you're breaching your fiduciary duty by NOT telling them to buy.... especially when YOU have some yourself. So, if you were on the stand and one of your clients was suing you and said "Why the fuck is it good enough for him but not for me? I lost out on millions in gains"... what would you say?
To be clear I'm obviously talking about a *small* diversified crypto position (3% total portfolio, 80% BTC, 20% ETH, LTC and XRP for instance), not a 50% YOLO position.

Fantastic news. At first I was sad because I purchased mine on Feb 27, but after reading it appears I'll have a $140 refund coming. Sweet!
I have noticed, however, that sometimes the transactions don't "take", and I have to unplug and plug the keepkey back in for some transactions to take. It's a little weird, becuase it doesn't say "transaction not accepted" or anything, you just check the transactions page, and a transaction that otherwise looked like it went through, doesn't (and the balance doesn't change). Perhaps something to do with the chrome plugin, but it's the only bug I've experienced yet.

Untrue. You can put actual bitcoin in a self-directed IRA, or if you prefer an easier method, you can buy GBTC for exposure in any tax advantaged brokerage account. What GBTC isn't is an open-ended fund. It's closed, and can't be arbitraged. There's also a one-year lockup on newly created shares. That's why the price doesn't follow the underlying that closely (that, and it's the only way to get tax advantaged exposure for most people who don't want to set up a SDIRA). But one share of GBTC does currently represent about ~0.09 actual BTC in their trust.

News flash - as USD price goes up, so will fees in USD even if they stay the same sat/byte. Seriously. Complaining about a $1 fee at $1,300 / BTC? That's like bitching about a $0.15 fee when we were back at $200. Don't remember seeing any of those threads...
It really shouldn't be surprising, shocking, or a negative in any way. It's a result of the recent price appreciation, and will continue upwards if the price continues upwards too.

No. One thousand percent no. On principal alone. Let me guess - you're pro-BU and for a 2MB limit? Because *no one* on the other side is saying "please let's all compromise!". They're the ones getting shit hurled at them. You guys are the tea party of the fucking bitcoin world - loud, obnoxious, hypocrites, vastly in the minority, and you can't stop yelling for a fucking "compromise" when you deserve absolutely nothing of the sort.

@_date: 2017-03-26 04:28:51
Sure. Three days ago, it could have been. But it's persisted for about 450 blocks now, or three days-ish. The odds of BU mining the number of blocks they have, over that time, if their hashrate *hasn't* actually fallen, is astronomically low.
I actually first "called" a local top in BU hashrate two days ago [here.]( I also followed up with that post just a little while ago in the new daily dicsussion [here.](
My point being - it could have been variance two days ago. Now? Very very low chance of it being variance. Very very high chance of BU's hashrate actually decreasing.

They weren't running on fractional reserves, but did control the keys to the BTC (that others had bought on margin) themselves. That was the CTFC's issue as I understand it - that BFX hadn't technically "delivered" the margin-bought BTC to the buyer. I understand why they don't since it's really just an asset with a lien on it, but AFAIK in futures or margin trading you are still the custodian of your futures or stocks, even in cases of using initial margin. In this case, bringing in bitgo w/ bitgo having one of the keys themselves satisfied the CFTC that BFX had "delivered" the bitcoin bought on margin to a third party. At least, that's how I understand it. If you're in the US and buy on margin, your bitcoin are secured by a key that bitgo owns, meaning BFX couldn't take or use those bitcoins for something else since they don't technically own them because they can't control them alone (I think), they just have a lien on them, and they "belong" to you, but on initial margin with the same contractual obligations (i.e. liquidation) as before.
Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

SHA256 doesn't matter for satoshi coins. What matters is ECDSA, and specifically, the secp256k1 curve. Satoshi's coins were sent to p2pk addresses, which means the public key is known, which means the private key is only protected by ECDSA.
If all you have is a p2pkh address (pay to public key hash), then it's a public key that's been hash160'd (a combo of SHA256 and RIPEMD160), so even then a vulnerability in SHA256 wouldn't mean jack.
Also, crypto algorithms degrade slowly over time. First the weakness is theoretical and published, then years and years later it's finally proven. Hell, google only *just* last year was able to *prove* the weakness in SHA1 by actually generating a collision - and it took them 6 months of an entire server farm to get there.... the weakness was known at least seven years ago, and people were recommended to move away from SHA1 years ago still.... and yet... ONE collision has ever been found. There will be *lots* of warning before any of the crypto algo's or hash functions involved in bitcoin go belly up. Crypto algo's and hash functions don't just die overnight.

Get any HD wallet (Electrum, Bread, etc) and generate a 12 word seed. Write it down. Generate an address, and send your bitcoin to the address. Delete your wallet &amp; software (but you must have your 12 words written down first).
Order a keepkey or a trezor. When that arrives, reconstruct the wallet on the keepkey or trezor with your seed, adding a pin to the device as well. Keep the pin protected keepkey or trezor in a safe deposit box, and obscure your seed keeping multiple copies in multiple secure locations.
Boom. Done.

I'd respectfully disagree on both points, but I can see why some people would err on the side of caution. 
To your first point, you're *exactly* trying to double or triple or more your money in a few years when you've got a small amount of it. Dude... investing $5k and having $10k 10 years later is fucking pathetic and no one wants that shit. The dude wouldn't be in if he wanted 5% a year after inflation. Pat yourself on the back for being careful, but you were broke to begin with and you're still broke after 10 years in that scenario. 
In your second point you say being cautious is the way to wealth. Most people will *never* make it wealthy investing in what everyone else is, and especially investing only $5k. Business along with investing takes some luck. Even Buffett admitted he'd have a hell of a hard time if he started today. And don't look back at 100 years of the Dow Jones and tell me 7% a year is something you can safely expect moving forward. This is the age of seeking alpha outside of risk adjusted, expected, GDP based returns. When you have a small amount to invest is exactly when you're risky, just like how you should be riskier as you're younger. This dude's probably got plenty of time to make up for mistakes. To your point about the amount being invested not being relevant, I disagree once more. Mentioning Buffett again, he said he could make 100%+ returns a year if he was managing a portfolio of only $1m. When you have more to invest, your options are actually *limited*, not expanded. Take advantage of the small portfolio size and seek some risk.
I understand $5k is relative, but we have some insights in to his living situation as well. Apparently $5k is 6 months living expenses. An emergency fund. Not a large amount, sure it's sizable and meaningful to him, but it's also something that's likely replaceable in under a year.
I guess my point is, I don't see the *harm* in taking risks when you have a small amount of capital or are young. 
@_date: 2016-12-09 18:26:24


This is not true. For *any* ETF to work properly, shares need to be able to both be created and destroyed through redemption of the underlying. If you'd read their S1, you'll see they plan on doing just that - offering redemption to institutional investors. Your average joe won't be able to redeem shares, but Mr. Institution with a basket of 30,000 shares needs to literally be able to go to the ETF issuer and redeem the shares for the underlying (or, to sell the underlying to shares). Without redemption or creation, you get something like GBTC which has notoriously traded at a huge premium due to liquidity (i.e., the inability to create new shares when demand warrants, and the inability to redeem shares for the underlying when supply warrants).
The whole reason the ETF is fantastic as an on-boarding mechanism, and the main reason people are excited for it, is that *if* volume flows in the ETF needs to go out and acquire bitcoin from any and all sources to keep the share price roughly equal to the NAV (or, market makers will acquire BTC and sell it to the ETF for shares, this increasing the outstanding shares). This means institutional *and* retail money flowing into the ETF *creates actual bitcoin demand*. If it lived in it's own world with a one-year restriction on redemption (like GBTC), then it *won't* trade at the NAV and they will have failed at creating a proper ETF that tracks the value of the underlying. Not only that, but the ETF could trade at a premium and it would have no effect on the actual BTC price.

This is trash. When nominal value is small it's absurd to expect or even attempt some kind of normal diversification. 5% in bitcoin of his $5k would be $250 worth. He's already got one... so you're saying he's 3x over invested? Nonsense. If he actually diversified that portfolio he'd pay fees out the ass buying $250 of REITS, $500 worth of S&amp;P, etc. Good luck even beating inflation with some shit like that. May as well wipe your ass with that $5k.
OP, don't buy home depot. Don't buy fucking government bonds. You're talking about $5k here. Honestly. *IF* you lost it, how long would it really take for you to make it back? 3 months? 6? No risk, no reward. You're hardly risking anything in the grand picture. Dude's got $5k man... he's not going to turn it in to literally *anything* putting it in stocks or bonds or crap like that. Sure, he might lose it in bitcoin, but at least then the dude *has* a fuckin chance...

This 1,000%. Why OP cashed out from a tax-advantaged account (and likely is paying a penalty) to get exposure to something he could get *within* that account via GBTC is silly. I know, GBTC trades at a premium. But whats more important than that premium IMO is the ability to buy / sell without losing gains to taxes, especially with something like BTC that has tremendous upside. The tax savings alone could be worth millions. 100% of my ROTH is in GBTC. You can only contribute so much each year, so the minute you take money out you're shooting yourself in the foot...

No. This is a false and misleading comparison. The proper comparison would be between satoshi / byte, not TX fees in USD. Here's why.
You completely fail to mention that, over the last year (the time frame of your chart), the USD price of bitcoin has risen 166% (price in mid April 2016 was about $450). All else equal, and a stagnant satoshi / byte and there would STILL show a large increase in USD TX fees. Fees per byte ( have increased about 3-4x over the last year depending on which day you choose (from about 30-50 sat/byte, to 130-150 sat/byte), just about in-line with the number of TX's in the mempool. This makes sense, as this basically zeroes out the effect of the USD price increase, and lines up the fees with the mempool TX.
TLDR; you focus on USD tx fees when the proper comparison would be for sat / byte unless you controlled for price.

That didn't happen.
And if it did, it wasn't that bad.
And if it was, that's not a big deal.
And if it is, that's not my fault.
And if it was, I didn't mean it.

Well I can chime in from the other side - I hold about 580 BTC and I am very much *against* BU and very much pro-segwit / core. I am for a UASF if it is the only way to implement segwit. It appears more and more likely that it will be.

a) they haven't created any new privately placed shares since January when they stopped private placement, and b) there was a one-year lock-up on newly issued shares anyways, so any new share currently being unlocked were purchased a year ago.

When you buy that same burger, do you need to wait 60 days until you can eat it so the store is sure you won't charge it back?
Double spends are rare. CC fraud probably carries a higher loss rate than the risk of accepting a 0-confirm tx for something like a $13 meal.

Try 28.8%
Top 20% rate for nearly all of the proceeds + 3.8% obamacare + 5% utah state tax (assuming the buyer's principal residence is in utah).
People really *vastly* underestimate long-term capital gains rates on *big* gains. Only the first $400k isn't taxed at 23.8% fed level, and the difference in tax on the marginal rates between $0 and $400k+ only amounts to about $35k in savings over the max rate. So, sell $3m in gains, and you'll pay the top rate on all but the first $400k (assuming no other income, as cap gains rides on top of earned for purpose of determining your cap gains rate).... and the savings on that first $400k really isn't that much in the grand scheme of things. Perhaps 5% of the total taxes owed.

Your fault for spending it before you had it in your account. You really going to spend thousands suing for "damages" in the low hundreds at most? You can't sue someone because you were an idiot and spent your money before you had it. Read their TOS. You're 100% SOL, they make no contractual guarantees regarding the timing of bank transfers, so stop being a baby. When you say shit like "a very large amount of money" and you're talking about $4,500... and *then* you say you want to sue them for "damages" from this inconvenience? It really makes you sound like an entitled 17 year old who's never lived a day in the real world. Take your pocket money elsewhere if you're that upset with Coinbase.

Capital gains count as taxable income, but not AGI. They do determine your top income rate - they ride on top of all earned income for the purpose of determining which "bracket" you're in for that capital gain, so indeed, with $400k in capital gains and $0 in earned income, you'd still pay capital gains tax. It would be pretty silly (and a ginormous loophole) if you could literally pay no taxes on *millions* in realized gains just by taking a low salary year. You end up paying $0 on the first $50k of gains or so, 15% on the next $200k, and then 18.3 (obamacare tax) probably until $400k, and then 23.8% from there on out. Don't forget, any state tax gets applied to long term capital gains as well. But capital gains *does* basically count as income *insofar* as it determines what "bracket" you're in, which of course, effects the capital gains rate.
If you had $400k in income *and* $400k in gains, you'd pay the whole 23.8% on the gains (since as I mentioned, cap gains ride on "top" of earned income for the purposes of determining your income tax rate / cap gains rate, so all $400k of your *income* would soak up the lower marginal *income* brackets, leaving your cap gains to the highest cap gain bracket).

Technically not really true. I'd imagine some, if not most miners, hedge their expected mining rewards by either selling futures contracts or by contractually locking in a price / delivery contract with an OTC or partner broker/exchange, similar to selling real futures contracts for delivery of the underlying at a time in the future. If I was a miner I'd want to minimize as many fluctuations as possible, especially downward price pressure, at least in the near-short term (3-6 months). That's enough time to make changes if things go south and you still get your cash flow, so I can't see the majority of miners coins hitting public exchanges. Perhaps smaller miners, but the larger ones who pre-pay for electricity and deal with contractual payments can't just not have cash flow one month because bitcoin crashed. I'm sure institutional buyers have contracts in place to soak up the majority of mined coins.

I zoomed in on the BB width in trading view [weekly bitstamp chart]( I cut off the tops to focus on the bottoms. We hit an all time low for weekly volatility, and even at current levels have only had one time with lower volatility in history. The spring is sprung. There's no reason this should be a dump. Fundamentals are looking strong and there's a lot to be bullish about this summer (segwit, lightning, thunder, halving).

Yes there is. If you claim long term gains for a sale within one year of the hardfork, it can be assumed you owned BTC at the date of the hardfork and received the hardfork token.

They'd need a team of 60 to get through 28,000 tickets a week at 5 minutes a pop, working 40 hours each. At $10 / hr, that's $24,000 in wages a week, or roughly $1 per ticket. If they actually *do* make anywhere near $3.5m / week (let's even assume it's revenue, not profit), then yeah, considering the clients are what *make* them that money, it would be worth their while to dedicate .006% of that towards servicing them...

Now let's talk about the mail. Can we talk about the mail, please, Mac? I've been dying to talk about the mail with you all day, OK? "Jihan Wu" this name keeps coming up over and over again. Every day Jihan's mail is getting sent back to me. Jihan Wu! Jihan Wu! I look in the mail, and this whole box is Jihan Wu! So I say to myself, "I gotta find this guy! I gotta go up to his office and put his mail in the guy's goddamn hands! Otherwise, he's never going to get it and he's going to keep coming back down here." So I go up to Jihan's office and what do I find out, Mac? What do I find out?! There is no Jihan Wu. The man does not exist, okay? So I decide, "Oh shit, buddy, I gotta dig a little deeper." There's no Jihan Wu? You gotta be kidding me! I got boxes full of Jihan! All right. So I start marchin' my way down to Roger Ver in HR and I knock on her door and I say, "Roger! Roger! I gotta talk to you about Jihan." And when I open the door what do I find? There's not a single goddamn desk in that office! There...is...no...Roger in HR. Mac, half the employees in this building have been made up. This office is a goddamn ghost town!

Best case scenario I see is a successful argument that it's similar to a stock-split like *google* had a few years back, where they split the shares into different classes. You could argue the primary chain is the "class A" shares and the secondary chain are the class "C" shares. However, there aren't substantially different *rights* with the chains, just differing protocols...

Thanks for your opinion, redditor for 13 days.
Sorry, but shit like this is just standing in the way. became *almost* just as fucking one-sided as over this UASF shit. Shut the fuck up and let the goddamn world move forward. Stop being children, in the real world we don't always get EVERYTHING we want. Segwit? Check. No asicboost? Check. GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. Hardfork blocksize increase would have to happen *at some point* anyways, and not to mention, there are ways to activate the segwit part of segwit2x and then go back on the hardfork part. Just take it one step at a time people. Take what you can get, and use that foster progress. This community has been torn apart for too long over this fucking shit. Meanwhile, we've been left in the dust and other coins are 25x'ing in value left and right.
