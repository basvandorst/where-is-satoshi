Cool. I hope you do. Any reason not to?

Horrible creeping authoritarian law. Sadly not surprising given Australia is a FVEY partner. 
Until Bitcoin (and all crypto currencies except monero) add confidentiality to transactions it's not much better than bank cards.

I reported as a bug as well assuming good faith that CMC will rectify this issue.

This is more of interview than the debate but clear and concise

I noticed the performances issues in Android 8, glad to see this is being worked on and not just my device being buggy ��
The Samurai dev team is awesome. Their simultaneous focus on privacy + usability is unparalleled and makes for one of the best cryptocurrency wallets out there.

Tryin to understand- that block with 682 Txs is almost double the block weight (2 MB vs 1.1 MB), but that only yields a 3.5k increase of inputs/outputs which is not double the amount of Txs
What am I misunderstanding?

Back in July 2016 I tried to buy 10 BTC from a guy on Local Bitcoins via the app in Los Angeles. After sending SMS messages, a couple phone calls, and me sending my BTC receiving address he agreed to meet later that evening. Then 15 mins before meeting he said he was going to be 15 mins late. Then 30 mins after our initial meeting time he called saying he is just leaving now and will be another 15 – 30 min delay. I was sitting at our destination spot waiting. Then 10 mins before that 30 min window was up he called saying actually his girlfriend is going to come instead cause his dad suddenly needed to go to the hospital and that he would just send me the coins once his girlfriend counted my money. I said that seems weird and not what we agreed to. He tried to reassure me it's all good but it sketched me out bigtime so I bounced. Be smart out there.
This sort of stuff makes me sad about Bitcoin and people and concepts like LocalBitcoins. It's as though society is not quite ready for anarchy or communal peer to peer structures.

That is the craziest part to me. Real money. Waiting through it all. Glad you're ok. Hope you get your coin back.
@_date: 2017-04-04 11:09:25
Great stuff wish I could have taken you up on that offer ;-)

What type of nodes (or configuration of a node) is needed to do this?
@_date: 2017-05-08 15:23:02
I see. Thank you for explaining. Can you elaborate? I assume "economic nodes" means nodes with hashing power (to process transactions)?
@_date: 2017-05-08 15:34:15


Wait, does that mean purchasing with currency?
@_date: 2017-05-08 15:43:34
Ok. That's a bit confusing. I understand miners sell newly mined blocks for fiat currency. The other thread (from pb1x) seemed to say configuring my wallets to use my fullnode would be enough to make my node more vaulable. But you mention "accepting any Bitcoin payments"
@_date: 2017-05-08 15:39:11
Thanks for explaining.
@_date: 2017-05-08 15:26:57
so if I configured my wallet to verify my transactions on my node would that be sufficient?
