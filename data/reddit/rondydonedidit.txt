Avg rate for an electrician in New York is 23/hour. Yeah that’s the workers bro, not the boss. Get your facts straight
Edit: idc what the website says this is just a random photo the first I pulled from google. Yet I know real master electricians that have told me the number 200-300 an hour. So it doesn’t matter what a website says that’s just how y’all Reddit users show proof by linking to some random website so I followed suit. But real electricians that I know make way more than 200-300 a day.  more like 5k a day servicing multiple houses with 3 plus vans going house to house all day.

Sorry had just woken up when I replied to this. You pay 200-300 A DAY? So you hire scumbag electricians to do a bad job on your ELECTRICAL WIRES IN THE HOUSES YOU ARE RENTING TO PEOPLE?? And you think that because you hire second rate electricians which no other landlord does because they’re not insane and care about people’s safety more than saving money on work, that it means that real electricians don’t make 200-300 an hour? Can you give me a list of your properties so I know where NOT to rent?
@_date: 2019-12-06 14:12:31
Edit: yes people will do it for 200-300 a day. Like my buddy that doesn’t even have his journeyman’s yet, he would do it for that price. I’m talking about master electricians here 200-300 an hour easy. I rest my case

HODL bro

If you’re not going to HODL, then sell it. just don’t send it to somebody you don’t know. Saw a similar scam posted here last night

Yeah I’ve been out to Colorado hotel to hotel for weeks purely on Bitcoin profit. Climbed mountains and drove back home in my luxury car. Didn’t feel the need to add that into any of my internet arguments at the time I was doing that stuff either because I don’t need to feel like I’m better than anyone else. Seems like you do. Even by your first comment. “Never get that much out of *me*”

Very humble of you. A small electrical project takes about an hour. I remember installing a ceiling fan and a porch light at a ladies condo. Bill for 400+ dollars it took us an hour and a half prep, install and clean up. On to the next house a lady needs an outlet installed had to get up in the attic, drill a few holes, took an hour and he upsold her on some special breaker switch(can’t remember what it was specifically) for an extra 250, took us an extra half an hour to do that. Probably 2 hours total at that house for over a over 500 dollar bill. He only had to pay me 10 an hour the whole time. Don’t know how you’re surprised that a master electrician would make 200 an hour after 8 years of mastering the most dangerous common trade in America. Nobody wants to fuck with electrical stuff because they can kill themselves doing it of course they’ll pay top dollar. And yes 5k a day when you have 3 vans all servicing 3-5 houses a day. Anybody else wanna argue about something they know nothing about?

If you only pay them 300 that does include supplies they buy supplies not you that’s so simple. Again. WRONG
@_date: 2019-12-06 20:29:45
This all started of you arguing that a master electrician doesn’t make 300 an hour. I’ve explained how that is true 3 different ways and you seem to think that because you are a landlord that your opinion is more valid. Your opinion is that an owner of an electric company doesn’t count as an “electrician” and therefor my statement is invalid, but my whole statement is centered around the fact that a master electrician is an owner of an electric company. Because why wouldn’t you run your own after 8 years? Master electricians make 200-300 an hour easy. I rest my case.  
Also no I don’t hope you have an electrical fire you are twisting my words. all I said is that if you are paying that cheap for a days electric work odds are that it’s shotty work and will result in electrical fire, calling attention to it because I hope you DONT have a fire.

Hourly rate is how much one person makes in an hour you absolute idiot. If he makes x dollars after costs have been factored that’s his hourly rate. You’re blocked dude you are insanely dumb
@_date: 2019-12-06 16:58:08
It’s okay. Good luck with your electrical fire property management company.

I would be happy for you if you weren’t senselessly arguing with me over a statement I know to be true. Adding in that you “climb mountains” thinking it’s like a bonus point in the argument. Why would I care about that when you’re trying to give me a hard time for putting my 2 cents in. Asserting your false opinion over mine

2. Only one of the guys has his journeyman’s and makes 25 an hour. So one van would be 25 + 12 an hour. The other van 12 + 10(me) an hour. The other van was usually just the master by himself although we swapped sometimes. So yeah 5k was over exaggerating but easily 3k a day. Plus he has other ventures he rents his property out on the weekends for weddings and events for 2.5k and books events all the time. Dudes a multimillionaire and he’s a tradesman is what I’m getting at. Didn’t come here to argue the technicals just explaining that master tradesman make fat bank, never mind the small details, which somebody that knows nothing about what I’m saying wants to argue with me the small details trying to invalidate what? I don’t know

I feel like I would drink a beer way too quick for that to matter. And I prefer not having to drink through foam because the foam sucks and gets in my nose, and then I have a sticky nose all night.
Edit: leave it to reddit to downvote me for sharing my opinion on beer foam

Can I borrow this from you when you’re done reading it
@_date: 2019-12-06 20:38:02
Dude no, my buddy that doesn’t even have his journeyman’s wouldn’t work all day for 300 if he took it all and worked alone. If that’s what you pay for work they probably are scumbags that are lazy and I know the type because our landlord hires them and they did a horrible job redoing the house my dad lives in now and it took them months longer than expected. Nothing disgusting about the truth, well that’s not accurate. But I’m just saying what I know from my experiences, if that’s disgusting to you then that’s your problem.
Edit: 300 is crazy dude that would barely cover supplies... working all day? How many things can you fit into a days work? Installing all the houses outlets and all that stuff? Yeah that’s at least 250 in supplies for a whole house worth of wires and you pay the guys 300? Get outta here man you’re trolling

But if you buy with credit card on Coinbase it’s a much higher % fee than if you buy with bank account. You may need to wait a bit for the bank account link to process depending on your bank.

It only takes one person and some wires to be an electrician, working for yourself with a master electrician license you can make 200-300 an hour easy. I have a buddy that does side work every weekend and he hasn’t even gotten his journeyman’s yet, of course that’s under the table but.. it’s not that hard to find customers. Imagine in 6 years when he’s ready to start his own, he’s been doing side work for all these people, that’s a huge customer base to have just opening.

Oh look out we got a big fish here. He’s more of a person than us because he makes more money look out. We’re in trouble, big boss came around he’s not playing. Big “property investor” over here holy guacamole probably drives a Mercedes and wears his ray ban sunglasses no matter how cloudy it is. You’re who hires my boss that’s great man, how does that change the fact at hand that master electricians make a lot of money?
