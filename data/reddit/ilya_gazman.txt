Can I trust them? I already got burned with MtGox.

Already did it with my 31 BTC, and now I am trying to mine it back. What other choices do I got?

OMG there is a reason for those confirmations. Other wise you can be forked. It makes it possible to sand the coin twice. Are you sure in what your are saying? This put bitpay in very bad position.

I suggest you from now on to downvote all the unproparate and cruel comments from people. May be we can make the change as community.

It sounds very promising. Thank you.

Their office is not virtual. Those were only rummers to kill the price.

It's now Monday 5:15 PM at Japan. We been told the update will be on Monday. I am going to F5 to the midnight, or until my keyboard die(To much Gox can do that...)

Proving and backup are not the same. I can backup my opinion about your stupidity with that comment, but I can't prove it ;)

You are rushing in to implementation without giving a clear definition of what is needed to be done. And even more than that you are mistakenly assume that a good developer will come with good ideas for design, how ever in the real life those are tow different things not necessary found in one person. 
I suggest you to open a foundation for this project, put 100K inside this foundation and ask people to help. You have a better chance hiring a talent rather than get him volunteered.
I am a top level developer, and I am getting 35K just for one week of consulting.

This is what happens when you take gox out of equation.
There is no good without eval.
@_date: 2014-03-09 09:27:24
So why not Coinbase than?
@_date: 2014-04-12 18:08:01
Yes it does if more than 1,000,000 people eat from it.
@_date: 2014-02-17 08:26:34
Most of them not working o update only once a day. It's not a big help.
@_date: 2014-04-12 18:13:27
But I am. I am selling bad karma, I will not advice my friends to invest in to bitcoins, or I will not advice anything but only tell my gox story, and it will do the same damage. They will not invest in to Bitcoin and the price will go down, eventually, slowly, like it does now.

Unlike many people here who are waiting for the official announcement from MtGox: Yes we are dead! I find those as good news.
I don't care how many pressure it tooks to take him out and say this. The bottom line is now we have some answers:
Q: Are MtGox is dead: 
A: No!
Q: Will we get our coins back: 
A: We don't know, even Mark Karpeles do not know that. But we do know that he is trying hard to bring Gox back online.
Q: When we will have the final answer about MtGox future:
A: Soon, as now even Mark Karpeles cannot stand the pressure and may be even this week we will know.

I am reading your post and all what I understand is:
Your "trusted" friend called MtGox secretary, and she told him that they don't have a phone, after realising that they are speaking telepathically, he decide to sell all his bitcoins.
**Conclusion:** Sell sell sell, MtGox got a telepath secretary and she knows...

Well, you can post in reddit about it, so there is that...
