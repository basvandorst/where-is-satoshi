Well on youtube, twitter alot of people are predicting a massive week I guess. For me I think the way to really win here is to transition your alts to btc and vice versa, the weeks I get it right it feels like im walking on water, the last week was hard to take I doubted to sell and got punished, however I cant afford to take a spanking again lol. In btc atm, hoping for the bull run, sell for usd, buy back, then go into alts, then prepare for the fork. This could be a really nice week. Followed by the fork. Just need this!

I know its soon my alts just bled lol, market reacted. I need to sell off and be awake for the small pump
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:26:46

@_date: 2017-12-23 02:21:27

@_date: 2017-12-06 20:07:55
True btc being a bitch atm 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:45:57
True I have put most my money in. I trade alts to make btc. Currently 50% up in 6weeks. Hoping over the next yr I can own 1 btc.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:13:49
Lol bitcoin diamond was on binance. Check it out.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:01:44
If it goes up too quick, complaints
If it goes down, complaints
Heck even if it stays the same, complaints
Lord have mercy
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:10:07
Well im not into ltc never monitor eth , bch iota dash xmr have took a knock in.comparison to satoshis. However I hold other coins. No big ones
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:50:26
Varies with these dodgy forks lol, diamond was for 1 btc you got 10 diamond
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:56:53
Yeah I don't really care about btc price, long term it will keep going up. Selling my alts pre bull run is crucial.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:42:48
Damn I wishi was part of your family :/
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:27:29

Sponsor a 0.1 btc braaaa
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:26:22
Okay what happens if its a ban? How far will the price tank
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:40:12
Hmm well im sure you still bought them bk early. Imagine students like me only finding out about btc at $5k. Im trading alts so hard to move up my btc holdings.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:07:43
Bro I sold my diamond already
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:31:12
Lol they gave 10diamonds for 1 btc. Diamond traded at $80, really you never quite know. It's free money! Hell yes I care!
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:19:20
Don't understand sorry. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:37:16

I know I was expecting him to say it was gifted to him in 2010 or something
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:56:39
You 16 or something?
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:49:00
Lol honestly everyone wouldve expected this post fork. Now the fork didn't happen, its the same result. I dont know why anyone would think btc is gonne sky rocket today after the news.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:55:15
Lol yes great news agreed. Though bitcoin rose up way too quick. People swapped alts for btc bull run. I did it too. I switched back to alts 2 days ago I think. This is what happens. People swap to maximize their gains. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:17:35
Every analysis I saw points to 8200 , I d k why, lets pray.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:02:19
Lol why do you reply when everyone can see now it wasnt the dip.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:09:54
Lol I guess its a moment thing, I  took advice from people saying people will sell @ 10k , I normally don't but I did , never mind though. Gutted but il go on , if it continues this way whos to say where this will end. Still early days
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:32:46
Ive heard its not healthy for sometime now. I sold at 9850 its painful. Nothing hurt me as much as this really
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:00:54
Yeah man I didnt mean to sell, I don't know what happened I sold all alts for btc the stupid things was cashing out, I never cash out. Everyone was like cash out. Huge mistake. I will hope we go back to 10k so I can buy
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:13:13
Haha at least u aint a dick and getting offended. Thumbs up to you.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:14:39
Haha my friend bought at 7500$ last time, you sll know where it landed lol. Patience. I did it too. We learn
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:45:14
Why though?
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:40:04
Yeah when I bought when $1= 13 zar last mpnth , I viewed bitcoin as a hedging mechanism not only did it appreciate our currency is tumbling. Literally in one month ive had over a 50% rise in wealth which is kind of ridiculous. As im a student I put all my savings from my previous part time jobs in the crypto world. From next year I start my first job in my profession i intend to put all my spare money in bitcoin too. Bitcoin has really changed my life.
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:38:16
Money. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:06:11
My journey with the alts started maybe 3 weeks ago. I was up by .06 btc on my initial investment. Then btc decided to hulk out and I currently own .03 less than my initial investment. .9 swing in a matter of 2 days roughly 630$. The journey with the alts is complex yet intriguing. You have to cash out at specific targets make a profit and put into btc, must  find a balance, theres no proven track record like btc that dips and rises. Though the alts werw sandwiched between the forks. This was just my experience. Regret not swapping over. All the time , effort and research only to lose out if I held btc. Though the alt game is intriguing, abit immature people on the subreddits thinking they the next btc. Though never the less a learning experience.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:31:16
I really dont understand people like you. You make a profit. Thats cool. Why come on here ? Share your success with your friends and family ? Dont understand what you achieve by such posts. Does it boost your ego/confidence? If so its quite immature. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:53:38
This made me laugh
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:22:46
Im actually curious to know about the fork. Bittrex wouldve done their thing. Yet its only coinbase. I just think there's no fork.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:41:37
Ive lost alot today too sadly roughly 75 vtc today. All because bittrex couldnt place an order in an event for me to try and redeem myself I hoped on to trade and that also ended up sour. First one I was unfortunate. The second time I shouldve cut my losses. Im clinging on hopeful for a pump to however my spirit is broken. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:48:11
Lol I actually thought that all these people were going to topple the guy
@_date: 2017-11-24 13:20:50
Yes I heard guys talking so I sold some btc
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:04:27
Rotfl as much as this question was genuinely sad , this comment made me laugh so much.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:49:51
Wait for the dip. I recall a few times I bought in the green ,it was a regret.  Never have I been sad buying in the red. Or you could just buy a small amount now as we at an ath , keep 5 portions buy one now , wait a while see what happens if we dip buy again a bigger portion , you can see what im getting at, I just bought at an ath for an alt trust me its painful, even though its long term , you want the best deal , fomo is real and patience is key!
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:53:55
Is this the dip though? Please tell me this was the dip
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:52:08
Sold st 9850 put a buy order at 9k , saw the price 9600 rushed to buy. Only to see it got filled
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:08:28
I also see this how can btc fall if people are buying at this rate. I have heard analysts say it will drop at 8 9 10 now 11 will they say this at 15 too? This train is crazy safe to say just hop on and don't get off
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:13:52
True but is this the bottom or is 8k the bottom
