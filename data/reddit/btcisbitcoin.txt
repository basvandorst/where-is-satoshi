It’s like you don’t understand how bitcoin works.

The thing is, what makes btc bitcoin is the fact that the majority decided which chain to follow. Roger is just being a sore loser and trying to act like there’s some conspiracy, when in fact bitcoin worked exactly as it was designed. 
Sure there are many forks, but none of them are bitcoin any more than litecoin is bitcoin. At least litecoin starter their own blockchain and didn’t rely on airdropping to all btc holders just to gain users. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 00:39:41
As always I decide to check the r/btc thread on this and wonder how they can possibly spin this so roger is hero. 
They literally only talk about Jimmy storming off in the beginning and fail to mention the other 40 minutes of the video.

The bias is so strong here because bitcoin cash is an actual scam. It’s not even a matter of which chain you prefer. BCH has no reason to exist other than leeching off the bitcoin brand. Many altcoins do what bch does and do it better. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 05:39:01
@_date: 2018-09-05 04:01:26
Not with that attitude. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 01:42:51
I don’t agree with any of his points aside from him stating that crypto is better than fiat. 
His only response to the first 10 minutes of the debate was “I bet you a million dollars that bch has a higher market cap in 10 years”
@_date: 2018-09-13 14:56:22
Sorry that your shitty joke came off as an ignorant comment. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 01:57:00
Exactly. Roger spoke like a dictator, slamming his fists and shouting his points. At least jimmy was formal and only spoke about facts. Not bringing up crypto vs fiat to rile up the crowd into cheering for him. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 03:12:25
This is bad and you should feel bad.

19 probably
@_date: 2018-09-11 01:34:15
That would be fine and dandy if roger would quit trying to mislead people into thinking BCH is bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 14:23:23
I don’t know OP, but I don’t like him. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 15:17:38
Award for most original comment goes to..
@_date: 2018-09-11 01:35:38
It’s not about suing anyone. Maybe brand was the wrong word to use, but there is no doubt that roger ver actively tries to push the narrative that bch is bitcoin, when that’s just factually incorrect. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 21:50:57
Honestly probably less than .01%
@_date: 2018-09-13 14:40:55
It’s 3D print

It screams insecurity. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 02:05:06
Get outta here with your common sense!
@_date: 2018-08-11 02:32:28
Sure that’s likely, but it doesn’t matter. There’s no reason to insist it was Hal or Nick Szabo. Satoshi was satoshi. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 14:18:14
Just because coinbase won’t accept them doesn’t mean somebody else won’t either. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 12:47:04
I’ve been around plenty long buck-o. Sure I’m not a day trader so high fees don’t bother me for the few times I do trade. If you don’t like the fees go someplace else. 
And I remember the dust situation, and guess what, they fixed it. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 23:26:53
It is immediately added to the mempool upon sending. It’s usually about 10 minutes before it is confirmed by the next block. But the transaction is still visible, even at 0 confirmation. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 12:38:59
Who is getting ripped off? I use binance and never once felt like I was being ripped off. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 18:54:31
Crypto doesn’t need exchanges. Doesn’t mean they shouldn’t exist. Your arguments are beyond moronic. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 02:11:58
What do you reckon the number of people in the 21 btc club is?
@_date: 2018-08-23 22:16:01
Bitcoin needed them in the beginning, but it no longer needs any of them. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 14:50:00
All in since day 1. Let’s do this!
@_date: 2018-08-30 12:50:24
Except in most parts of the world, you need a bank account for many things. Nobody needs a centralized crypto exchange. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:56:19
What are you talking about? Am I missing something?
@_date: 2018-08-05 01:44:03
Also isn’t that how Starbucks mobile app works now anyway? You load up a prepaid card with money and make a purchase. Now you can use btc to load up instead of a debit card. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 00:01:21
Only bcashers say bitcoin core. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 18:57:07
“B-but it’s unfair to the bitcoin gold devs!” 
@_date: 2018-08-21 03:05:02
Lol you are the exact type of person that shouldn’t be investing. YOU made the decision to invest, but you continue to blame bitcoin for losing your money. Take some responsibility. Bitcoin isn’t the worst thing that ever happened to you. YOU are the worst thing that ever happened to you. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:55:25
Why must it? 
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:57:05
But that’s not the case so what’s your point?
What if the moon was made of cheese? Would you spend it then?
@_date: 2018-08-30 12:59:42
I totally agree with you. We shouldn’t be celebrating how much exchanges are making from us. But I also think complaining about it solves absolutely nothing. 
I see it as they provide a service, and it is very convenient to use. They have every right to charge whatever they want in fees. If I don’t like it I’ll look elsewhere. 
@_date: 2018-08-06 01:10:39
Sure, if you bought shitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 15:21:19
Crediting yourself to promote your dumb twitter account?
@_date: 2018-08-30 12:38:13
What’s wrong with paying fees for a service? They aren’t holding a gun to anybody’s head and forcing them to pay. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 11:30:21
That’s why people usually wait for confirmation. But if you trust the person sending or it’s only a couple dollars worth, it usually safe to accept it. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 14:07:42
Why is anybody here? Such a stupid question. I dare you to try signing up for cable without a bank. Try buying a house or a car. Banks are necessary for 90% of people. Nobody needs a crypto exchange. Go cry about something else instead of things within your control. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 22:13:26
I think by the time it got shut down, we didn’t need it anymore. There’s no doubt it had a huge impact on bitcoins adoption. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 16:25:15
And what about a few months before that? It’s easy to pick arbitrary dates to compare prices. BTC is up 48% from 1 year ago. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 01:59:34
They already have different names. Bitcoin and bitcoin cash.

Since when is an exchange a bank? Is it robbery for eBay to charge you a fee for using their platform?
@_date: 2018-08-21 13:56:40
Lmao but he KNOWS it’s only downhill from here. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 21:26:21
Easy to remember because BTC is the RIGHT choice. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 03:20:42
Lol then why spend your time on a bitcoin subreddit? You clearly know nothing about bitcoin outside of being some get rich quick scheme. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 05:04:01
@_date: 2018-08-04 16:07:59
It’s worked well so far. Don’t see any reason to change now.

There’s no getting through to some people. They see a business making a ton of money and they are outraged because apparently binance should operate out of the goodness of their heart. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 14:08:15
Never said I love exchanges. Nobody needs a crypto exchange. Many people need banks. That’s the difference. 
@_date: 2018-08-05 01:42:35
For real. I can see not making posts about alt coins, but you should be allowed to make a comment referencing another coin. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 23:25:25
You are correct. A transaction will remain in the mempool until it has been chosen to be included in a block. Depending on the fee and how full the mempool is. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 17:39:22
So every crypto blog in existence?
@_date: 2018-08-29 03:17:38

What happened to innocent until proven guilty?
@_date: 2018-08-29 15:16:08
Which makes sense because the sub is r/btc not r/bch
@_date: 2018-08-04 16:48:52
Exactly. Altcoin trading has already lost me some btc. I’m holding onto what I have left for dear life.

Cannot melt bitcoin into bars
@_date: 2018-08-24 15:31:53
Exactly what he would say if he DID have a large sum of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 04:58:45
Ok so I guess he’s right. Bitcoin sucks and is to blame for him losing money. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 17:36:14
BTC is a genetic freak, and ain’t normal. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 13:03:35
I actually am 100% in for the tech/ideology. The investment part of it is just a bonus. I only use binance when I want to dabble with an alt I’m interested in. In no way do I use an exchange for any sort of daily use. 
It’s only the day traders who spend a lot of time on exchanges and I don’t feel any sympathy for them paying fees. 
@_date: 2018-08-18 16:21:37
Filled with dead babies. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 15:23:44
Your crazy if you think they don’t hold btc too. 
@_date: 2019-08-04 02:16:28
I mostly agree with you. Doing things for “good karma” almost seems selfish. Like you’re doing something good only because you believe you will get something out of it in the future.
@_date: 2019-08-03 03:32:34
I sold 90% of my gold/silver for bitcoin. Holding PMs is nice, but hodling btc is much nicer.
@_date: 2019-06-25 02:12:16
Highest sell price isn’t really a thing. Higher sell price also means higher buy price.
@_date: 2018-07-09 16:16:51
I am currently maxed out with bitcoin, ethereum, and nano. I’d like to add monero once it’s released. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 12:38:45
Fuck that. As if I needed another reason to dislike coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 18:12:33
