Don't use cavirtex if you can.
Cavirtex pulled a stunt and delisted their BTC denominated stock on havelockinvestments.com Basically shafted any stock holder not wanting to register IRL and  in the process setting a precedent on Havelock investments on how to wrangle the BTC obtained at IPO from early investors. They don't deserve the business or the fees they charge.

I'd avoid them. They've effectively dismissed their early investors by delisting from the exchange.  These investors will now have to register for paper based shares in Canada; the whole point was that a BTC denominated share issuance would reap the benefits of the digital age, eg instant transfers and a global market. However it seems their consideration for their lawyers out weigh their consideration and respect for early investors.
I wouldn't be surprised if they treat their customers with the same disdain.

I wonder who stood most to gain by delisting from havelock. It certainly wasn't the very people who provided a good chunk of the BTC.
Did cavirtex buy back any 'stock' before or after the delisting was announced.
What percentage of havelock users actually got their 'paperwork' in order to claim their 'alberta' CA based certificates ? 
If ever I saw a scuzzball move to make it more legit, this is it. IPO on a BTC based exchange, and then announce that the shares are no longer openly tradeable, give no dividends, watch the price tank and then delist. ASSHOLE move. 
Kyle (as others have suggested) you really need to find out about the shitty ethics of the poeple who run cavirtex. You are being used.

Circle jerk is unfair. 
HSBC has $2.3trillion in assets  And yearly profits in excess of the fine. 
$1.9B is not significant on these scales. 
Especially if you consider that penalties can take on a form of relief as in the recent Deutsche Bank case for example. 
Bitcoin is insignificant monetarily; market capitilization is also insignificant, the market depth is pittance. 15x more like 15000x the comparison is a straw man. 
Yet the point that the fines are sturdy is only correct in as much that it the banks and their lawyers, PR and Marketing benefit if it is seen as sturdy.

Mostly nothing is wrong. It has been said money laundering used to be just called banking. IMHO money laundering is for finance what pedophilia and terrorism is to national security and its budgets.
It is all a little moot. The dutch gov is ethically suspect for its rent seeking behavior over peoples savings. I believe any currency holdings over ~40K euros need to be declared so that they can be taxed irrespective of any or actual gains realized.

Not joking: bitcoins must be declared on the annual tax return:  It seems then than any holdings (over 42.2k limit) are taxed:
"Taxation on income from savings and investments is in the Netherlands based on the assumption that people will have a taxable return of 4% on their net capital. The actual level of return (for example interest, dividend, capital gains or losses) is not relevant."

Not so much championed; but long identified^[[0]](  as an inherent risk of the eth-ICO and eth-foundation construct. It is one of the many factors that will lead to eth's failure but which bitcoin is not susceptible to. 
This is an especially significant risk becuase american financial regulations have a long reach and chilling effects. Look what happened to russian oligarch bank accounts in switzerland [this week]( for an example.


Claim is underplaying it, I would say bitcoin maximalists have a sound monetary system. It is been designed and developed precisely not to be at the whim of central leader, not to be under the patronage or leadership of a foundation, nor to succumb or be caught up in a legal quagmire by virtue of being a preminded-ICO/security.

Compare listening (or reading) rusty, the two matts, (corralo and blue), kanzure, ptodd, author of libbitcoin, jnewbury, adamb, pwullie, lopp to any alt proponent/creator or fanboy; they are different because of the depth of knowledge, experience and lack of hyperbole. 
All the alts (if not outright scams) seem to be marked by infantile idealism, mismatch between intent and capability and emphasis on marketing efforts. That is why I said there is intellectual dominance. It is fun to think how it came to be; the origin context of bitcoin. It wasn't launched on Web 2.0 website ---like it could have--- but on a mailing list; not massively significant, but another tidbit of substance over style. 
As for an unsophisticated metric if you compare academic papers for  bitcoin, ethereum,

How many shit/alt coin creators or proponents can express their software in terms of economic or political theory ? Look at saifdeen or szasbo (or even 'characters' like j.song, s.palley or bitsteins) each more eloquent and well versed than all those who represent the alt space. It is really no match IMO, and we haven't even got to the  hearts, btctina vays, hedl pomps and lopps, or for that matter the Bizonacci, cryptocobains and Jim btcs (nor for that matter back in the day MP(OE) and amir.).
As I said, metrics are somewhat pointless, as are appeals to authority. It is a matter of opinion or taste. I find bitcoiners dominate intellectually because they have richer, deeper and more varied ideas, arguments and convictions (i.e. better memes).

    -----BEGIN PART 1 of 2-----
    Nasdaq Inc. and broker Cantor Fitzgerald LP are looking to join the
    rush on Wall Street to trade bitcoin, which powered above $11,000 on
    Wednesday.
    
    Nasdaq aims to launch bitcoin futures in the first half of 2018,
    according to people familiar with the situation.
    
    
    Separately, Cantor said it is seeking to launch bitcoin derivatives on
    an exchange it owns, also in the first half of next year. The moves
    come after two major Chicago exchange operators announced similar
    plans for the digital currency.
    
    Many financial institutions have been reluctant to get into bitcoin
    due to its notorious volatility and its lingering association with
    money laundering and other criminal activity.
    
    Investor interest has grown as the digital currency has exploded in
    value. Bitcoin is up more than 10-fold since the start of the year and
    was recently trading at $11,273.89, reaching a new high less than a
    day after it crossed the $10,000 mark, according to CoinDesk.
    
    The emergence of bitcoin futures would be a big step toward maturity
    for the cryptocurrency, which is less than a decade old. By letting
    traders bet on whether bitcoin rises or falls, a futures market would
    make it easier for both big banks and retail investors to trade
    bitcoin.
    
    Nasdaq's bitcoin contract would debut on Nasdaq Futures, or NFX, a
    marketplace that the New York-based exchange group launched in 2015
    that until now has mainly focused on energy trading, according to the
    people familiar with the situation.
    
    One of the people said Nasdaq is trying to differentiate itself from
    rivals CME Group Inc. and CBOE Global Markets Inc.—the two Chicago
    exchange groups that have announced plans to launch bitcoin futures—by
    designing a futures contract that better tracks the world-wide price
    of bitcoin. Nasdaq has briefed market participants on its plans, this
    person added.
    
    Nasdaq isn't completely new to bitcoin. It lists an exchange-traded
    note linked to the digital currency on one of its European exchanges.
    
    Cantor, a global financial firm founded in 1945 whose businesses range
    from bond brokerage to investment banking to real estate, unveiled its
    bitcoin-derivatives plans in an interview with The Wall Street
    Journal.

    -----BEGIN PART 2 of 2-----
    The firm aims to launch a bitcoin swap—a type of derivative—on Cantor
    Futures Exchange LP. Cantor's swap would allow traders to bet on
    bitcoin prices up to three months out, with built-in protections to
    limit their losses if bitcoin prices swung above $15,000 or below
    $5,000.
    
    The firm expects retail traders to be the initial adopters of the new
    contract, but it is targeting institutional players too, executives
    said.
    
    "The asset class is not going away," said Shawn Matthews, chief
    executive of Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co., the firm's brokerage arm. "If
    you look at the next level, it will be the institutions coming in and
    being larger participants in the marketplace, especially as liquidity
    gets better."
    
    Cantor's exchange is a backwater of futures markets, with a few thinly
    traded contracts tied to weather events, foreign-exchange rates and
    gold. But it does have a valuable asset: a license from the Commodity
    Futures Trading Commission, meaning it would be easier to launch
    bitcoin futures on Cantor's exchange than to create a new futures
    exchange from scratch.
    
    The exchange last drew attention in 2010 when it attempted to
    introduce a futures contract based on the box-office results of
    Hollywood movies. Following intense opposition from film-industry
    lobbyists, Congress banned futures tied to movies' financial
    performance, thwarting Cantor's plan.
    
    Separately, Nodal Exchange LLC, a decade-old U.S. futures exchange
    specializing in electricity and natural gas trading, is exploring
    whether to launch cryptocurrency futures, a person familiar with the
    matter said. Nodal's parent company is majority-owned by German
    exchange Deutsche Börse AG.
    
    Such upstarts could face tough competition from more established
    futures exchanges. CME, the world's biggest exchange group, is seeking
    to launch bitcoin futures as soon as the second week of December. CBOE
    is aiming to launch its bitcoin futures by early 2018, the company has
    said. Both CME and Cboe's planned contracts are under review by the
    CFTC.
    
    Bitcoin was invented by an anonymous creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto
    and began trading in 2009. As bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have
    gained popularity, the space has become an attractive opportunity for
    exchanges, industry veterans say.
    
    "Every research department of every regulated exchange is saying, 'Can
    we do this?,'" said John D'Agostino, a former Nymex executive who sits
    on the boards of several funds that trade or are considering trading
    cryptocurrencies.
    
    Futures exchanges often struggle to attract liquidity and interest in
    new products. But the boom in digital currencies will make such
    product launches easier, he added.
    
    "The majority of costs associated with that are marketing. If people
    want to trade this thing, why wouldn't you?" Mr. D'Agostino
    said. "This is a gift from the heavens."

How about you tell them to get on the side of SMEs which want to start a bitcoin related business but get zero support.  They get no explanation as to why the can not open accounts. I'd rather trade with the likes of ibwt than enter in more relationships with established banks.

There is no legislation against the use, trade, exchange, barter or generation of bitcoins in the US.  It is not expressly forbidden, illegal or regulated so it is implicitly lawful.  The EFF's  position undermines this principle and has chilling effect. It would have been better to get involved and invite the relevant authorities to audit, certify, validate, inspect, approve or express their positions now, before the eff get in involved in any potential third party disputes. This would result in a better position and send a more positive message.
@_date: 2013-05-15 19:11:38

If SD had this as a business model it wouldn't last a 1/2 a year. Trust has been and is a big selling point for SD. This laundering you speak of would require 'out of band' collusion and would nullify the current transparency of SD transactions. Bye bye trust.

"NashX literally destroy them by making a transaction from our wallet to our wallet with minimum possible possible transaction amount with funds to be destroyed as the additional transaction fee."
Are you going to ensure you chose a variety of miners or peers that are going to mine or relay this particular transaction (or perhaps better transactions) ? They might be quite profitable and there would be an incentive not to propagate or some how flood your node(s) with dummy connections.

Good timing and a wake up call for them. Given that FinCEN can interpret existing regulation, and come up with guidelines; has it not shown the EFF to be somewhat too conservative and cautious beyond what is helpful ?

It depends on which market. Look at the bt sales on  too. MtGox is in Japan. There is a good chance you are interacting with a UK entity at 75quid and reducing the risk, transaction time, no AML crap and are getting a more convenient service. You also get a bank customer services, trading standards and even the police all at the end of a local telephone call. I.e you have a little recourse if it goes south. You get what you pay for.

The party insured would have to prove ownership of the bit coins, which is neigh on impossible unless the insurer acts as a trusted third party and holds the bitcoins for the insured. 
This would also have to be limited to a country or two, yet the point of bitcoin is to work over the borderless internet. For example some claims would need the backing of a police report or incident number, how many police forces are competent or even willing to deal with domestic or SME information assurance ?
It is a nascent market and I'm sure there is a need as well as a niche  which is both safe for you and profitable. Good luck and keep us posted.
