Your situation has reduced risk.  If market goes up, you keep the profit and lie to him.  If market goes down, you make him work an extra job to make up for the loss.  lol

True, only because everything is priced in dollars.  I only keep enough dollars to get me through the week.  But I keep most of it in crypto.  It's tough, especially days like this when it's down.  But it always bounces back higher.  It's gonna be a bumpy ride all the way up to the moon.

Thanks for sharing!!  So what happens to the rest of the BTC when you die?
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:01:18
Oh man, what ever you do don't let her keep the private keys

Investors know this, HODLERs know this.  But right now I feel like there are a lot of newbies that are down because they got FOMO and just bought at the highs.  And it must cause a lot of family drama, especially around the holidays.

Let me guess, you bought Bitcoin last week and $19,000 and now your sleeping on the couch wondering how your going to get any christmas gifts?

sorry just some ironic humor showing how both men and women can be shallow sometimes.  lots of emotions in these markets, just wanted to lighten things up.

People called me a dumbass last year when I went all in on BTC at $800.  You will lose half of those returns because she will spend them.  Simple math.

If market goes up, she will divorce you and figure out a way to screw you out of 50%
If market goes does, you have to work an extra job to make up for the loss

I do, the whole point is that BOTH men and women can be shallow!

Pretty much all in, 80% crypto 20% physical gold and silver.  And I own a car.  But no debt!

yea if it goes up your a genius, if it goes down your a gambler.  Call me whatever, I'm a HODLer because I believe in sound money.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:18:31
No, single here.  If you really loved your wife, you wouldn't invest in crypto.  Greed will tear your family apart.

The dollar has lost 97% of its purchasing power over the last 100 years because the supply is controlled by a private corporation known as the FED.  I'm keeping my money in crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:00:46
lol thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:47:18
I'm kidding of course, good luck to you and your family!  Hopefully we will all live happily ever after no matter what.

Bitcoin is about truth and trust.  And we should have truth and trust in our marriages and all relationships!
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:58:37
True, but it's only gambling if you lose
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:55:17
That is a good strategy for minimizing short term risk
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:11:41
Your right, that's why I recommend the "crypto test" to all new couples.  I tell couples that they should go all in Crypto to see if their marriage can handle the stress and greed.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:31:16
sorry, was a joke didn't mean to offend.  Good luck with your investments!
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:03:36
Yes, a huge paradigm shift is on the horizon.  Anyone holding dollars will be screwed.
