I am reading posts from you quite often lately.
Again as previously written I am very sorry to hear about your personal hardship. 
Anyway, I first thought you are a smart early adopter kind of guy who now works as a Bitcoin consultant (what would give your opinion some weight as you might understand).
But the more I read the more it becomes evident that you are some dude who got tremendously excited about the Bitcoin rocket to the moon some months ago (just like thousands of other dudes at this time). 
You then apparently decided to make a living by convincing your friends (and god knows who else) to join this "surely we all will get rich quick"  scheme.
Now you realise that you didn´t make your homework and that the promises you made don´t hold up. 
Again, I feel bad for you but the fault is yours and not Bitcoin´s. 
The current situation is by no means surprising and failing to having accounted for that as a Bitcoin consultant (!) is just plain stupid. 
No offence. 
The good news is that you might get lucky as the promises you made could likely become true ..... in the next few years. 
So stop spreading FUD and chill the fuck out. 
TL;DR. 
Contrary to what you name indicates you don´t know jackshit about Bitcoin. Relax it will probably be fine

I expect and hope that governments will get regulations in place as I agree that this will be necessary for a widespread adoption.
Anyway, the control over Bitcoin won´t be nearly as strong as it is currently the case with fiat.

a threat to whom? 
Not to Bitcoin I´d say, quite the contrary.

I had no issues withdrawing bitcoin and fiat; also had to deal with their support few times (also for friends) and while they were slow (very often I was wondering if they are really so stupid or if they are actually trying to delay the process), **they did help me out in the end** (took about 5 weeks each time).

... and the world is black and white...

I see that sounds awesome, it is so simple and intuitive too..
however, is the backup really safe? It´s so simple :)
Any reason to not replace the blockchain wallet (on my PC) with it?

Thanks for the link! 
The high ask prices at some exchanges are actually pretty good for me, as I buy cheaper on Kraken.
So I might end up making money with the transfer...

I think the cartoon is incredibly funny and very well executed (I love the details). I normally don't endorse making fun of anyone but come on,  you surely will agree that this is hilarious. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 18:43:17
At the end is more. much more.
@_date: 2014-03-18 14:33:49
I also use an offline wallet on my PC but I think I won´t in future. 
Also this local trading thing sounds amazing.
@_date: 2014-05-22 17:34:33
I agree, but if course people try to understand it,  see patterns and so on.
It would be strange if noone would

Great, thanks!

No, frequently reccurring purchases of the same amount are your best bet when you don't have much money to spend at once.

Your title is indicating that the majority of people actually have dismissed Bitcoin...
Care to elaborate? 
EDIT (copied from another post above): I really don´t see the justification for your statement. 
Yes of course, according to some media outlets Bitcoin is dead and buried already. 
But everyone who has been around here for a while knows the value of such statements. 
Otherwise, Bitcoin is growing (into mainstream acceptance) ever more quickly. 
ATM´s, Merchants accepting Bitcoin, Exchange regulations in NY etc...

The huge advantage bitcoin has compared to fiat money is that it is decentralised which is why it cannot be controlled/manipulated by governments.
Right now everything is still relatively fine but the reason why people believe in Bitcoin is because they are convinced that the current monetary situation is not sustainable and will eventually crash.
The US is printing money like crazy, that´s not possible with Bitcoin. 
You are writing that Bitcoins limited supply is not real because of altcoins but I don´t quite understand. Of course there can be an indefinite number of altcoins but who´s going to use them? 
And how is that relevant to Bitcoin? People can trust in Bitcoin because they can trust in its limited supply. The existence of other crypto-currencies does not change that a bit.
 Furthermore, banks are instrumentalised by governments (or the other way around), which led to many people losing their hard earned cash. In other words, people are not in control of their fiat and that´s becoming clearer and clearer.
I agree, there is still a long way to go in terms of security, usability etc, however, the reason why I believe it will be a success is because it doesn´t have the disadvantages that are currently killing our trust in fiat; admittedly, there are others but nothing that can´t be fixed as far as I can see. 
You however cannot fix corrupt governments. Power to the People.

That's all you have to contribute?  Critising OPs title? 
@_date: 2014-04-23 17:20:19
the problem is that it would remove one of Reddit´s core features.

Which is why scenarios like that in Cyprus only happen when the shit hits the fan.
The rest of the time it is just trickled away from you. 
Google distribution of wealth.
I don't say that bitcoin will solve all these problems but I am convinced that it will open up new ways to tackle them. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:59:04
well, the fact that is is decentralised and that the number of coins is limited. 
right now our governments have full control of our money and there is nothing you can do about it. 
Your hard earned money is yours because they let you have it, but this can change every moment (Cyprus). 
@_date: 2014-03-18 10:45:39
that´s awesome. thank you!
