PoS has incentives same as bitcoin.

Are you claiming that gold is/should be decentralized?

GNOME (DE) did trademark the name and now groupon wants to use the name for their own project, "operating system for merchants to run their entire operation". GNOME asked them to use a different name since this one was registered and groupon just said "We don't give a fuck". 
GNOME has to pursue legal action because if they don't they could lose the trademark.

Luckily for us. 
Gold is not decentralized so there is no reason that mining it should be profitable to the individual. Bitcoin is supposed to be decentralized but it is becoming unprofitable for individuals to mine it thus making it centralized. What works for gold doesn't necessarily work for bitcoin. 
Hopefully you now understand why your comparison between gold and bitcoin mining makes no sense.

Without any context one should be able, just looking at your comment and what you quoted, to answer your question. It doesn't need to but it could be, hence the "could be" in OP.

If solar and ASICs become cheaper and more efficient the costs of attacking the network will fall. No matter how much cheaper mining becomes the bitcoin network will forever need to be expensive relative to its marketcap.

AFAIK, Peercoin has been doing that for over 5 years while using less electricity.

How does bitcoin solve the store of value problem? 
I see it like this. Once the mining reward drops to zero or near enough either the transaction fees will become high (less transactions daily then if we used bitcoin for everyday transacting) which will drive away the users. Or the transaction fees could stay low which would lead to miners leaving the network decreasing the security of the network.
I really don't see how bitcoin can be a good store of value long term, and I doubt that it will be able to fulfill both roles (daily transacting and store of value) better then the competition that aims to do one thing properly.

For that you just need the car to accept a start signal signed by a specific key. No need for a blockchain.

And you can buy any POS coin now while it is cheap and then make it work for you. What is your point?

There is code for other PoS coins out there which surely suffer form the same weaknesses. Why not get in touch with them or are you just talking bullshit? 
@_date: 2015-03-10 14:59:09
That is quite possible but by that time bitcoin won't be competing with gold as a store of value.
@_date: 2015-10-13 09:09:59
Why? There are many blockchains without Bitcoin.

Unlike gold bitcoin, in the long run, can not be a store of value without some fundamental demand for it as a currency. Once the block rewards fall significantly, or reaches 0, without using bitcoin as a currency transaction fees would be insufficient ( not enough transactions since it is being used as store of value ) to pay the miners for securing the network an thus you would have miners leaving the network lowering its security. 
Also bitcoin can not achieve enough stability to be used as a currency. I think that adoption doesn't lead to stability, it is the other way around. But that's just my opinion.

What are you talking about? There are hundreds of blockchains without Bitcoin.
