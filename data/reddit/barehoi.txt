Would this be considered daytrading and is it frowned upon in general? I believe in the technology in general but a large amount of the population invested into crypto is in it just for the money, so why do people not do this more if it is guaranteed profits? Are they just scared to HODL and panic sell as soon as there is a dip, essentially causing them to buy high sell low?

Hey, I'm up 200% since Christmas Eve. My profits took a big hit because of the crash to altcoins but with Discord and my own research i've begun to recoup a lot of those now.

You mean lose money as make less profits than I normally would correct? I don't understand how you lose money if you just never buy at ATH, never sell for lower than you bought it for, and if it does continue to dip below what you bought it for, HODL and wait until it bounces up again? Like yea the people who bought at 19k have no choice to HODL even if it takes weeks, months, years, but that's the risk you take I guess.

Right, so what if I put $5000 and just HODL it until I see a significant increase in the price, and than use the other $5000 just rinse and repeating the strategy I asked about? Let's say I saw my $5000 in Bitcoin went up to $5600 in 20 minutes, I would immediately sell and take the $600 profit, hold it as fiat in GDAX and then just rinse and repeat with the $5000 initial investment and slowly watch my profits grow whilst still having the other $5000 in Bitcoin to HODL.
