Where is the utility in $30 transactions?
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:19:51
Needing bigger blocks wasn't a short sighted fix. The community knew blocks would become full and create high fees for years. Even with lightning network on mainnet, it is unlikely that the fees will come down within the next year. As a Bitcoin enthusiast I really wish it were viable to use as a currency today.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:16:09
How is the 1 satoshi/byte fee of BCH too expensive? That is just a fraction of a penny. And since there is no RBF or full blocks, you can be confident a 0 conf transaction will go through with BCH.

But muh raspberry pies!!!!

Because there is no reason for Litecoin to exist when Bitcoin can scale the same way. Do you see the contradiction of telling people to use a crypto that has higher throughput while simultaneously claiming that Bitcoin shouldn't scale the exact same way?
@_date: 2018-09-05 01:06:18
And why do you think Litecoin and Ethereum have lower fees? Because they have larger blocks....
Clarification: the blocks are more frequent effectively increasing the amount of data per hour if blocks are full.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:14:37
They are considered failures because they didn't get 50% of the mining hash rate?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:04:40
When has a blocksize increased failed?
@_date: 2018-09-04 14:41:57
Do you realize how stupid you sound when you tell people to use Litecoin or Ethereum to make a transaction?
@_date: 2018-05-09 20:47:59
You don't need to run a full sadnode. You can use a lightweight node and still make payments and participate in the network. Although the storage requirements to run a node may increase, the additional capacity allows more users to participate using their lightweight wallets. Solution: run a lightweight happynode and enjoy life.

What do you mean BTC fees are a hoax? Were you not around last December?
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:35:34
You don't know what you are talking about.
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:42:58
Lightning takes fees away from miners so I don't see the point you are trying to make.
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:23:50
That is a ridiculous statement. Segwit provides a very small increase to transaction throughput. That minuscule increase would do nothing to the alleviate the congestion BTC experienced in December if it were to occur again.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:12:22
Yeah fees are low right NOW. They were not this low last December, nor will they be low if Bitcoin were to be widely used as a payment method which I would think would be the goal of the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2018-03-08 16:56:35
You think $20 fees are reasonable?
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:05:53
Bitcoin will not be ready to be used as a currency with 1MB blocks unless there is a huge role out for lightning network with major adoption, which is very unlikely for the next few years. Better to use an alt coin with larger blocks and lower fees. (I know fees are only a few cents right now, but they will easy go back to being 20-30 dollars like in January if there is a similar amount of transactions.)
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:08:15
There are no off-chain solutions right now for merchants or users. If lightning actually worked as you described I'd agree with you, but lightning is not ready to be used by merchants and likely will not be ready for years. 
Why stifle adoption at such a critical period with high fees when a modest block size increase will allow more users and retailers into the ecosystem? Transaction fees will be lower but the greater transaction volume will compensate for it. Even when there is no more block reward the miners don't have to include transactions at a cost. A natural fee market will develop where miners compete to include transactions at the lowest cost irrespective of the blocksize.
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:32:58
Do you want to pay for things with Bitcoin? Do you want merchants to accept Bitcoin? Do you want Bitcoin to be a global currency utilized by the world? High fees makes it impractical which in turn hurt it's utility.
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:47:00
Segwit is at most a 4mb equivalent block at full adoption which is still pitifully small.
Transaction fees are down because people are moving to new cryptocurrencies without arbitrarily small blocksizes, not because of segwit.
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:21:32
Raspberry pis don't need to run bitcoin at the expense of Bitcoin's utility. 1MB is an unreasonably small size and even a minuscule increase to 2MB was fought through lies and deception. I want BTC to succeed, but I think it's development has been moving backwards. There is no reason for a 1MB cap and $20+ fees hurt bitcoin much more than slightly higher hardware requirements.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:45:05
If someone has shit bandwidth they don't need to run a full node. How are lower fees not helping them?
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:23:44
How dare you spam the network and force all nodes to download your burrito transaction for the rest of eternity. Hasn't anyone told you bitcoin is for HODLING?
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:27:25
I want to see Bitcoin used as a currency like it was years ago. 1MB is pitifully small and it cripples BTC adoption. I am not a shill, I want BTC to succeed but such a small blocksize is absurd and frankly embarrassing.
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:50:28
If you send a transaction using 1 sat/byte it could take months to confirm.
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:17:33
It's 1MB because of a single update made years ago. I am familiar with the arguments for and against a block size increase and have watched the debate go on for years. 1MB every 10 minutes is unreasonably small and severely undermines the utility of bitcoin. I hold an equal amount of BCH and BTC and no one pays me to make posts. I want BTC to succeed.
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:01:34
It wasn't always that way. Before RBF a merchant could trust that a 0-conf transaction would be included in the next block without the risk of a double spend. Core's full block policy hurts merchant adoption. BCH doesn't have these problems.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:46:02
Are you implying someone would put a hit on them?
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:29:12
No, he's right. There's another popular Bitcoin Cash node called Bitcoin Unlimited.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:07:12
They could make a ton of money by shorting bitcoin prior to their attack.
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:54:19
He could pay using 1 sat/byte that won't be included in the next block, and then send an RBF double spend transaction to himself with a higher fee. Accepting 0 conf transactions are not safe on BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:59:22
It's not that 5 cents is expensive, it's that it is trivial to double spend so merchants cannot safely accept a 0 conf transaction. Because the blocks are full they will wait indefinitely for a 1 sat/byte transactions to confirm. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:49:13
Blocks have been full since November. He could easily use a 1 sat/byte fee and broadcast his transaction again to himself with RBF after he leaves.
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:36:30
Let's just hope he doesn't execute a 51% attack.
