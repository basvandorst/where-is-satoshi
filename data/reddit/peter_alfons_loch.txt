I am very glad that you are answering my questions  
but my question is how does spending work in a wallet that has multiple adresses?  
I am seeking a detailed answer i am searching the web for weeks. Are the bitcoins decrypted with the private key then saved locally? or can i send bitcoin from my whole wallet with whatever private key from what ever adress? I just cant grasp how spending itself works with multiple adresses.

I have my wallet an all kinds of keys from there. I am just wondering how spending from the wallet works if the keys change for every transaction. There must be some kind of master key?

Sorry english is not my native language, I try my best here :(  
How does signing and validating work? I jsut can't grasp the concept when it comes to multiple addresses.

Thanks for this very detailed answer.  
I am just wondering how signing works? And when using multiple addresses are there then multiple signatures? Also how does validating work?  
I assume that people here are maybe afraid to share more details, probably thinking I wouldn't understand.

But how does spending work do they have to decrypt every adress to spend the funds? Or can all the private keys be decoded with the wallet password? I just cant grasp how spending exactly works in a wallet with changing adresses

It has one of those yes.  
But when I want to spend bitcoin from that wallet how does that work? Do they have to check every transaction to know which adress has what amount and then needs to decrypt all the adresses?

Thank you very much that is exactly what I was looking for :)

I assume i wrote my question wrong. I understand what they keys are for. But how does It work in detail i do not know.  
I try to rephrase my question:
How does signing and validating work? and when i send from multiple addresses does it create a hash for every address? I looked at this addresses history: [ there are some places where multiple addresses send btc to it. How does the network know that the transaction is from multiple addresses?

I am aware of the potential security risk.
I am very glad for your answers but i am seeking a much more detailed answer. How does the wallet software "take care" of it? Let's assume I would like to make my own wallet software. I am searching the web for weeks.
The issue i have is: does the software need to check the whole blockchain to know how much bitcoin "is" in each adress? and when it decrypts the adress it doesn't show the amount so I am confused how it all works. I assume it encrypts it ino a file that tells the amount?

So how does a wallet work? The service gives me the total amount and i can spend it easily. But if all the coins are on seperate adresses how dows it send the whole amount that exceeds what is on one adress?
