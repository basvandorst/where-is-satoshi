Not to be rude - but in your 15 years of trading you must have come by this chart:
Not every "crash" follows that same scenario. Yes, this one might. Or, this may end up looking like the other BitCoin crashes on a long-term trajectory up.

Well, since I've somehow managed "consecutive progressive achievement" - merriam-webster would call it a career. Profession or career - it doesn't matter. I program/support business web portals to feed my family, enjoy a few luxuries, and stay in touch with technology (which I love). Yet, if I didn't have to "work" I would spend my time reading, writing, working on DIY drones and robots with my son, maybe programming some light-hearted video games too, mixing music, traveling abroad, learning to surf...etc. You know - live.

My "assertion" is that each time there's been a sell-off, Bitcoin eventually charges back to that price and moves on to new highs. Has that not been the case the last 2 years?

The BitCoin market is not Forex or the NYSE - it's almost impossible to day trade it. There simply is not enough liquidity. If you're not in it for the long haul or for idealistic purposes, you're in the wrong market.

The longer it remains above $1000 (if it can hold for the next week or so) - people who've been hearing about bitcoin the last few weeks and haven't bought in yet - will finally buy in (or demand their broker find a way to move some risk into it) out of fear of missing the next run up in price.

During the 2008 market crash, I knew a Money Manager that shrugged off the daily news. I asked him what was his overall strategy - and he simply said, "I just buy." And when the market crashes? "I buy more with the same amount of money." 
To be honest - at the time I thought he was insane. However, at that time he was scooping up shares from companies like Apple at 80 and 90 bucks a pop.
My point is this - if you believe in the long term success of BitCoin, set aside a small portion of your investing budget and buy whatever amount of BitCoin that cash will get you. Then send most of those coins to your wallet and forget about them. Keep a few coins "in play" to spend and encourage BitCoin adoption.
Over the course of time - if BitCoin truly gets adopted, you'll have a nice little "nest egg" to help you get started in the next phase of the economy. 
If the project fails, and BTC value is reduced to zero USD - what of it? You invested in an architecture (someone convinced me of that in that is more than likely the future of currency - any currency - and you helped bring that about. That's a good thing.
Also - please take heart - we are rapidly approaching an age of super cheap energy, healthcare, food, water, technology...etc. Hopefully, how much money (BitCoin, USD, Gold...etc.) you have will mean little compared to the excitement of transforming our current world into a much better place while also simultaneously preparing for space colonization.
This all sounds far off - but it's not.

Each time we move even one dollar of fiat into bitcoin - we are voting, we are taking back the liberty that is ours, and we are participating in perhaps the greatest revolution in the last 200 years.

Sure - that's a valid possibility. Or the latest wave of "millionaires" cashed out and just released another good chunk of coins into circulation - people will pick up those coins and ride it to the next level. 
There's no way of predicting the future value of - well - anything. In ten years each coin may be worth a penny - or it may be worth a billion dollars. Or in 10 years we will stop "translating" BitCoin into any other type of currency - perhaps some hybrid of Social Equity and Disney Dollars. Who knows. 
In the end, I find the idea compelling - and if it isn't used for BitCoin, I think the blueprint will be implemented for something else like it.

Well, there really is nothing to compare BitCoin with - it's not like other currencies and certainly isn't a stock or commodity. 
I just found it interesting that as much news as BitCoin seems to making within our community - wealth gained and lost in a matter of days (even hours), most people in the general public still haven't heard of it.

I'm mostly joking. I've been in IT for about 20 years...so I do have a "career"...and I would quit in a heartbeat if I could afford to do so. I'd probably spend those regained hours doing something that is actually "fun" - like making things.

My overall point is there is no way to determine where this thing is going based on charts. If it exploded to new highs - it will look like the Apple chart someone posted below. If it continues to dwindle lower - then it will look the one you posted. Or it could baseline from here. Who knows.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:22:47
Yeah - I heard rumors of such a things as careers. My grandpa used to tell me about them. They sounded sorta cool...but not really.

Sure - I think it will exist in some form. It will be a long, bumpy road. Those that had a decent amount of BitCoins and they finally became worth something in a tangible way - are probably very emotional right now. I would be. Combine that emotion with newcomers that are hoping to cash in on the frenzy - well, we get what we've seen the last 2 days.
Those with a "well, this thing may work out" level of participation are less stressed (I am in that category). If BitCoin succeeds in the long term - each BitCoin has the potential to be "worth" quite a bit of the overall percentage of circulating BitCoins. 
I think the BitCoin exchanges (and those customers dealing with them) are suffering more than BitCoin itself. I can't speak for the creators of it - but it doesn't seem like BitCoin is good for Day Trading (trying to capture quick gains in price fluctuation). Unless traders and exchanges start dealing in very small BitCoin units (and eventually, if BitCoin is successful - that is what you'll see). 
I personally hope BitCoin is never an avenue for Day Trading. I would rather see it used as it is - not exchanged into the very thing it is trying to defeat.

How many people that buy platinum or oil actually have a stash of platinum bars or barrels of oil in their basement? Most buy and trade these things over exchanges that are in the end - bits on a computer. They do so because they "trust" the data is accurate and secure. The "trust" is either earned or lost over time. 
BitCoin is no different. It is still fighting to earn trust. Despite the fact that it is a WIP and has so much hype surrounding it - I actually think it is proving to be quite resilient. 
That is why I'm suggesting people that like the BitCoin philosophy keep buying in with a very small percentage of their investment budget. The architecture and idea are worth more than a few bits of data that say I "own" some flecks of gold dust in some vault I will never see (which will soon be worthless with the advent of molecular manufacturing).
