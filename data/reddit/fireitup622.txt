And when it dropped to 15k people were saying "but two weeks ago it was an all time high!" and then its going to be , "8k is still great! Four months ago we couldn't have dreamed of this price!

Hope you bought more of those "Cheap coins" at $11,000, and are ready to keep buying them on the downswing.

Exactly. Let me know when crypto currencies employ more individuals than banks, not currently seeking number of employees.

Nice sayings and mass delusion only carry reality for so long.

Nah I had the foresight to sell out a couple days ago when the global crypto market started stagnating. Are you projecting your bad day of alt bags onto me?

Because the public will beg for it since a bunch of people are going to get fucked over in the great bubble burst of 2017/2018 and blame the lack of regulation because they were allowed to recklessly invest in what they thought were bull shit and fraudulent companies with little to no oversight, but in fact is probably just a couple of developers and an open source software with no real means of securing a return on the investment.
Google "Buying bitcoin on credit" and just look at the number of sites offering bitcoin purchases with instant/no credit verification. The search results for "buying bitcoin on credit" started spiking around Thanksgiving of this year. The market has started to become whales propping up the price so they can unload their grossly inflated coins to suckers who will be left holding the bag, or people buying bitcoin on credit from other people who bought their bitcoin on credit, which is an engine that is quickly going to run out of steam.

The thing about gold is the governments regulate the market. Some ad company is encouraging people to dump their money into bull shit that's about to crash and burn. The whales or exchanges or some one knows the game is about to change, and they're going full force trying to convince people to buy in to this ponzi scheme. It's like you said, Bitcoin is going to go up in the very long run, right? The smart money on the short term is a big crash is coming, so why not wait and test the market. After all, if it's going to hit 100k in 2 years like many on this delusional sub believe, then I've no problem waiting for it to get to 20k before I buy back in :) like any rational smart person that doesn't come off like a paid shill.

Any number of ways? A simple one would be not allowing merchants to accept payment in the form of that crypto.

Am I talking to a bot or some shit? Bitcoin is crashing. Get out while you can because people are waking up. Hope you aren't left with too big of a bag..

Reasonable top is what we've already seen, and a reasonable bottom is $0 as bitcoin will be regulated and made useless if it ever becomes too large a thorn in the government's side. 
Willing to bet we see cryptocurrency regulation in 2018. People are being conned by thinking they're investing in stocks of some sort, but that isn't the case. There's nothing that seems to determine the price of a coin other than what someone can be convinced to pay for it. People are going to be really pissed when they lose their money/enter into debt because they got reckless with all the hype and bought a bunch of alt coins at insanely inflated prices before realizing there's no more people to sell them to at even more insanely inflated prices. Then, we'll see the public beg for regulation.
I'd bet this whole bubble is being manufactured to suck people in to buying a bunch of shit they don't really understand just to sour the general public's opinion of crypto currencies/make the public beg for regulation when it all crashes so the government doesn't seem oppressive by forcing regulation.

Brush up on your Elliot Wave Theory son. It's different because my layperson understanding is we hit our third impulse wave on the run up to 20k, we've entered a head and shoulders pattern, and the market is now correcting.
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:54:12
This is just getting sad now..

Dude just give up. I think a lot of people are needing to rationalize to themselves, "I should just hodl and everything will be ok in a week, right?" There's a lot of emotion wrapped up in the decline right now because people don't want to accept it's going to hit 9k in the next day or so. That little voice telling them it's going to rally back up and no one can predict the market is them telling themselves they made the right decision by not selling despite all indicators pointing towards a correction.

You just need to add in that you realize the difference between the value of blockchain technology and the value of a blockchain coin/token and pretty much all counter arguments are invalid.
