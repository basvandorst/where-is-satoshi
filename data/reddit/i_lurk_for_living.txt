If the great firewall of China is to be used to block all traffic from the port the bitcoin client uses to communicate, most people wont bother to change it hence the client wouldnt be able to connect to the network and wont be able to send transactions.

and whos gonna pay for that?
besides that the point of showing how small transactions are, was about how they would be uncensorable.
why would you put up unidirectional bitcoin transmition stations when you could just as well do it over LTE which would be actually simpler.
And if you could do it legally over LTE the size of the individual transaction doesn't really matter.

Being a registrar can't you just return domains which were registered fraudulently? The 6 confirmation delay for registering domains worth 10-50 USD was the biggest pain point for me as well. I doubt someone would put in a lot of effort and double spend just to register a few domains which will be canceled anyway.

weekend project for a software developer who also owns a gas station and is passionate about both bitcoin and delivering gas :D
@_date: 2013-04-14 16:41:34
We should not focus on exchanges, which are mostly speculation platforms and the BTC economy reflects that. Instead of more MtGoxes we need more Coinbases and Bitinstants. The obstacles you need to overcome to get a Bitcoin are WAY to high unfortunately. For Bitcoin to succeed we'd need an BTC ATM at every gas station. As I said currently the platforms are (badly) optimized for speculation and these platforms shouldn't be the gateway into BTC for ordinary users.
@_date: 2013-07-09 10:58:06
pretty sure gox works the same way
@_date: 2013-07-19 23:24:35
it is simple:
if you conduct high risk business you don't need the additional risk of loosing your proceeds due to price swings. one LR usd was approximately worth one usd. it is the same reason why most other business don't accept bitcoins without bitpay. And using bitpay is hardly an option as a underground vendor.
take the hyip/mml market that heavily used liberty reserve. bitcoin is simply not an option there because it in it self resembles a hyip/penny stock.
oh and all the regulatory heat bitcoin is getting doesn't help. underground currencies such as perfect money and liberty reserve were/are set up from the start to be anonymous and to operate in a legal dark grey are. the whole ecosystem is built around sketchy exchanges which allow you to get money in and out anonymously. bitcoin still tries to serve both the illegal and legal market at the same time with exchanges getting licensed instead of just shutting down if there is to much heat and operating in obscurity while they are not on the radar of LEO.
it doesn't help that many people view bitcoins as essentially a ponzi scheme

yes this is my personal opinion that i could gather from the little facts available. I am not blaming the authorities per se (well if they wouldve stayed out I could have my money in my account by now :D), I am just saying that this could take a while to unwind.
@_date: 2013-07-23 01:50:10
it is also important to know that the hash function (sha256) is like a black box that takes input (nonce, previous block hash, transactions) and spits out a seemingly random number. if you input the same stuff into the black box the number will be identical but changing it a little will completely alter the hash. therefore every time the miner tries a different nonce he gets a new shot at winning the lottery (reward, currently 25 btc). because the outcome seems to be almost random the miner has to try often. the more he tries the higher his chances of winning. so while nothing in this is truly random, we have no way of knowing the outcome without trying.

but won't this just screw both victims of a double spend? assuming he buys two different things with the double spend it is going to reverse both transactions instead of one and the fraudster doesn't have to care.

there are two types in germany: one is the low fee direct debit (lastschrift) which doesnt involve a balance check and only requires a signature. it is reversible and can bounce if the account has insufficient balance. the other requires a pin and the balance is checked beforehand. its more expensive but essentially not reversible

valid point but bitconica was robbed whereas (at least thats what simon claims) the fiat funds at btc24 are merely frozen and the cold wallet remains secure/full...
also wasnt bitconica hacked twice? they were forced to shut down because they just didn't have any money left if I recall correctly (due to keeping everything in a hot wallet).
