I've asked you one question: do you support monopolies.  You've provided no answer while asking me three questions.
I take this to mean that you do not support monopolies?
I said anarcho capitalists do not support monopolies on higher authority.
Most services government offers are monopolies.

If you think the war torn violence in Somalia is an example of people interacting consensually/voluntarily, I think you might need to look up the definition of "consensual" and "voluntary"

n. A system of government in which the people have virtually no authority and the state wields absolute control, for example, a dictatorship.
anarcho capitalism
n. A political philosophy which advocates the elimination of the state in favor of voluntary and consensual interactions between people.
Yes.  Dictatorship and anarcho capitalism are practically synonymns.

Yes; anything anybody has in their account or in escrow that's mid-transaction.

Education has incredible value.  
I have dozens of friends with degrees, masters degrees, and phd's that will take years for them to even earn enough to pay off their massive student loan debt, much less get ahead of the game.  I also have friends with degrees that are doing well with them.
My friends who are doing the absolute best are the ones who are very good at what they do; and that has very little correlation with degrees.
All I was pointing out was it was amusing to me that everybody who was chastising OP for his decision to invest a *very small portion* of money into something that could potentially have a big return seemed to accept without question that investing into a degree was a brilliant idea.
Circling back to my first sentence, education has incredible value; but a college degree does not always equate to education, and there is a lot if evidence showing how the value of a degree has decreased significantly in comparison to the skyrocketing cost in recent years.
Yes, I was expecting downvotes and I expect I'll likely be showered with more in spite of the fact that the trend I pointed out is measurably true.

You asked me how democracy is a monopoly; and I never claimed it was.  I have said government services are usually monopolies and that anarcho capitalists, in contradiction to what you were previously claiming, are unsupportive of that.  You won't even tell me if you are or are not supportive of that - so I don't really know where else you were expecting this conversation to go.
When I said most government service offerings are monopolies, do you just disagree, or do you not understand what I mean by that?  Seriously - you're not giving me anything to latch onto, here.
Let's take internet.  Internet is a big deal in today's world.  Many businesses provide internet services.  I can choose which one I want, and they compete for my business based on price and service.  If a business does something I don't like, I can take my business elsewhere.  If enough people take their business elsewhere, the business changes their behavior because they are losing customers and losing money.
Let's contrast to a government service.  Like a government school.  What if I want to send my kids to a different school than the government has zoned me for?  Too bad.  I have to pay for it anyway and send them there.  What if I don't even have kids?  Too bad.  Doesn't matter.  What if the school is awful?  What if the test scores are far below average?  What if there is a big bullying problem, etc.?   Too bad.  Doesn't matter.  Have to pay for it.  No competition means the quality will continue to decline -- just like any other monopoly.

If the state (a rich monopoly) doesn't steal money from the rich and kill non-state monopolies, there can be no freedom for the majority.  
I'm not following you.

We'll have to agree to disagree.  It's easy to kill somebody whether you have a gun or not, but most people do not wish to kill others.  If they did, they would do it.  
Military and police on the other hand believe that it's ok to kill people, and the government and public opinion seems to back them up.  And yes, sometimes it's necessary; you and I both understand that.  But I think the real problem comes in when police kill people at the slightest perceived threat, and when their judgement is wrong, which it often is, there are no penalties.  Same with military.  Tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of innocent people in Iraq and Afghanistan have been killed by u.s. military with no repercussions.  
I guess I just find it hard to agree with you saying that "trained professionals", which it sounds like you are equating to "government" should be the primary people with guns, when government is by far the biggest killer of innocent people on earth. The amount of gun related deaths by non-government people is paltry in comparison.  Not that those are ok - but if you are going to pick one to be upset over and disagree with, I'd have to choose the group where the biggest problem occurs... And that's the group you're suggesting should be the *only* ones with the guns.

Nicely worded arguments; but I am pretty sure that what the "rules" really mean is "in instances where it is most beneficial to the United States for bitcoin to be considered money, it shall be considered money; however, in other instances where it will be less beneficial for the United States, then it will *not* be considered money"
Which will translate to "Ross you're going to jail because fuck you."

All of these people coming down on you because you're playing with a small portion of college money... Sorry - can't help but laugh, since the value of college degrees seems to be declining faster than bitcoin has been lately.
Congrats on being mortgage free.  That's a huge accomplishment.  And best of luck with your wife!

@_date: 2014-08-13 14:10:55
have you communicated with bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-04-04 03:56:24
I read that. 
I also read where he said if bitcoin doesn't pan out, he'll replace the money. No big deal;  thus nothing to worry about.
There's also opportunities for scholarships and grants in the future.  Plus what his own kids would choose to contribute themselves.  It's quite possible the money won't ever even be needed depending on how well his children do and where they choose to go to school.  My college was paid for entirely by scholarships and grants with money left over.  Same for my wife.  
I certainly didn't say I agreed with his decision; merely pointed out it was funny to me that nobody questioned the value of a degree that costs enough that $10,000 would only be a "small portion" of what he has saved "so far" to apply towards it.  And being mortgage free, it sounds like it wouldn't take much to follow through with replacing it and exceed if needed.
Not only that, but through CLEP tests, AP classes, etc. You can obtain a degree now for as little as $10,000-$15,000 total. If the degree itself is what's important, it sounds like he has far more than needed for multiple kids to be able to go that route already, even without the extra money.
I'll take more downvotes now, should you choose to continue bestowing them upon me for making an observation and inviting a discussion.

I have no idea.  You said "only trained professionals" should have guns; but then you said people shouldn't have guns.  So should people have guns or not?
And if people shouldn't have guns, then what are you suggesting to keep people from having them?

I would also like for the people who completely fucked up the U.S. financial system to please regulate bitcoin.
Because terrorism!
@_date: 2014-01-13 10:14:53
I do respect your wish that guns shouldn't be in the hands of bad people while recognizing it isn't reality to make that happen. Many people who claim to be anti-gun advocate taking guns away from people at gunpoint.  I'm glad to hear you are not one of them.
I do find it curious that you advocate for guns in the hands of military and police though after expressing distaste for gun related violence; are you not aware that military and police kill far more innocent people than the people you are advocating shouldn't have guns?

Probably the largest bitcoin theft in history was 144,000 bitcoins that were stolen back in October of 2013. 
The thieves are publicly known as they have publicly admitted to the heist; but no law enforcement agency seems to be out to catch them for some reason.

I'm sure there's at least one person out there claiming to be an anarcho capitalist who understands the ideology as poorly as you seem to.
Having said that, I've personally never met or spoken with any of them who believe such a ridiculous claim that only governments are capable of aggression or oppression.
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:54:32
No higher authority? No accountability? I made no such claim.
Anarcho Capitalists don't want higher authority and accountability to be a monopoly.
Are you in favor of monopolies?

I did not claim democracy is a monopoly.

Why do people only worry about prices rising like crazy in fields the government is *already* regulating?
Why on earth would big pharmacy charge $10,000 for a common cold pill sans regulation? Who would pay that?
Why doesn't anybody ever suggest something like:  Coca Cola pricing needs to be regulated! Without the government, big soft drink would charge $10,000 for a caffeinated beverage!

Love the idea of the site; but it doesn't seem to work.  Nothing listed to buy, so I can't try that... so I went to post a wishlist but got an error message that says "Wishlist has not items"  -- (spelling errors pasted from their site).  I then emailed them at support and it bounced back as undeliverable... 
Great idea -- but is it dead already?
