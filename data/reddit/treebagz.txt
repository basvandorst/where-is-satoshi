Yeah it's super annoying for regular traders

You don't invest in currencies. You invest in income producing assets such as companies and real estate.

Why couldn't someone with a lot of money do what you're doing? The Dinklevoss twins did.
@_date: 2018-05-12 22:28:46
Yep. And in 1908, 1808, 1708, etc
@_date: 2018-05-06 23:44:52
That's not street art...

Yeah keeping low amounts seems safe enough.

I don't see why you would need to buy it all at once...

Interesting. Thanks for the thoughtful reply.

There must be a centralized service holding your Bitcoin, right? Nobody is standing at a Point of Sale device for 40 minutes to confirm their transaction...
@_date: 2019-08-19 17:32:42
This is the dumbest comment I've ever read.
@_date: 2019-10-23 10:35:35
It's almost as if the Lightning Network is still in development and the OP should have limited the amount of Bitcoin they put on it.
@_date: 2019-08-22 01:48:50
Which other cryptos?
@_date: 2019-08-17 07:46:15
It's the cure for cognitive dissonance after hearing so many stories about people getting rich with Bitcoin.

What a nice way to say what I was thinking :-)
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:46:29
Yeah but if they're on an exchange, you're not really moving Bitcoin, you're just changing numbers in their database. If you trade to a different coin then withdraw, it's now the exchange's problem if a replay occurs.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:10:03
Yeah I'm trying to move some USD to buy more Bitcoin. And this is only a correction- not a crash at this point.
@_date: 2019-06-18 22:52:33
Like Ripple lol
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:48:33
Because you can make a ton of BTC by buying undervalued altcoins and selling them after they go up.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:33:01
You don't know my confidence levels, bro
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:38:36
"Intrinsic value" means that you can eat it, it can give you shelter, it grows by itself, or can be used as a tool to create other intrinsic value. Good examples are plants and animals that we eat or a corporation that grows profits all by itself.
Except for a very few tiny applications, gold is just a pretty rock that humans have agreed has non-intrinsic value for a long long time. It only has value because we agree and believe it has value.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:47:26
Yeah that's what I was thinking too. Or to make it even cleaner, trade to like Litecoin or Ethereum and withdraw to another exchange. Then any replay issues are not your problem any more.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:22:03
Good idea. Never bet against Bitcoin. That's what I've learned.
@_date: 2019-12-06 04:35:26
What's the problem if the buyer does accept?

As the block reward goes down, I'll be getting satisfied with your mom.
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:20:03
Confidence levels stable. Was that a test? lol
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:19:25
Bitcoin also has no intrinsic value just like gold and fiat. It's value is derived from what we believe it to be.
The objective truth at the end of the day is the exchange price chart. If I buy an altcoin at a lower price than I sell it, I make BTC. Hard to argue with that.
Also, altcoins have their own features and applications. Even if you were to say that they're all just a testbed for Bitcoin, there is still value in some of those future Bitcoin features.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:44:54
I have them spread across Coinbase, Bittrex, Yobit, and Cryptsy because I trade altcoins. I haven't decided where to put them for the fork yet.
@_date: 2019-12-31 04:06:41
And that's a huge advantage
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:31:32
I'm getting ready for the flood back into altcoins after the B2X fork. It's gonna be nuts.
@_date: 2019-12-13 16:45:00
I bet a lot less than that is the real number. Plus Apple stock isn't meant to be a currency. So the volume should be a lot lower.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:03:34
Yep. It happens.

It's just depositing, trading, and withdrawing. You can withdraw to wherever you want including a different exchange.
