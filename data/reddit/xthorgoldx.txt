You also didn't sign an agreement regarding your use of public infrastructure, US economic access, or the benefits of military dominance in foreign policy, yet you enjoy those without complaint.


You have the choice to emigrate.

You're *kind of* correct.
In the event that you are *boned to all hell* and don't have a chance at winning, you plead guilty on a plea bargain in order to reduce your sentencing. The logic is that, in exchange for your cooperation in making the trial short by skipping all the debate and procedure, you get a lighter sentence.
However, very, very few cases are foolproof, because it all comes down to interpretation. Say that I'm at the range and I shoot and kill someone. One interpretation is that I murdered that person - I had the intent to shoot and kill them. Another interpretation is that it's *just* manslaughter - I was at fault for the death, but I didn't intend to murder someone. Another interpretation entirely is that it was sheerly accidental - it was a freak ricochet, and I can't be placed at fault at all.
With varying scales of severity (murder, manslaughter, etc) comes different standards for evidence. If you're going to try someone for murder, you have a much higher standard to fulfill - you have to prove that someone did it *and* that they had intent. With manslaughter, you just have to prove that they did it, regardless of intent, which requires less numerous, and less vigorous evidence.
So, this comes into play two ways: first, prosecutors will only try for the charge they know they can win, and defenders will try to disprove the charge either by saying that it didn't happen *or* that it wasn't as bad as being prosecuted. What's important is that, in many legal systems, defendants have protection against **double jeopardy,** that is, being tried for the same crime twice. This is why prosecutors have to be very careful in how much they want to go for (related: that's why most cases involving "treason" aren't tried as such, because it's patently impossible to prove; instead, lesser charges like "espionage" or "conspiracy" are pressed).
So, if you're found not guilty of *murder* even if you were guilty of manslaughter, if you're found not guilty you can't be retried in a criminal court - you can be taken to a civil court, however.
In Ulbricht's case, and many cases, it wasn't so much a case of "I didn't do anything wrong" but "I didn't do stuff *as bad as you're accusing me of.*" It's easier for the defense to handle and tougher for the prosecution to batter down, since the burden of proof is on them.

That's a pretty hefty charge, considering @_date: 2013-11-23 09:28:37
No... he's in too deep. The sheer stupidity and personality expressed in the posts is too nuanced to be a deliberate attempt at provoking a reaction.

Yeah, even with your oh so helpful Google search, only one story pops up - a *single* business having accounts frozen due to fraud suspicion. No one else. Nothing. Every result in that lmgtfy is a link back to the same story, just from a dozen different blogs - what, did you think 20 citations of source would make your position more valid, even if all of them are the same blasted story?
Even then, the amount of information in this story is so absolutely vague and spotty that to claim that it's evidence of "banks enslaving the populace" is pure and utter bullshit. They froze a startup company's account on suspicion of fraud, and currently even then we're still only receiving Coinjar's side of the story.
