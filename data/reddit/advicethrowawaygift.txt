Not to be all "buy cheap coin lolol" but this is really a relief for me.  I sold at $900 on Gox and realized a few days ago that I couldn't get my money out.  Buying back and selling on another exchange would have been a huge loss for me.  Was able to buy back at $890 and get my coins the fuck out of Gox.
I wouldn't worry too much by the way just hold.  It'll rebound.  Honestly even if it hit &lt;$500 the momentum behind bitcoin is huge now.  I would be surprised if it didn't rebound in weeks.

$50k for the amount of work required of most researchers is not a lot.
I don't think he means he's poor he just means that he's paid poorly considering how much and how hard he has to work.
Not to mention most researcher have massive student loans.

You really don't have to worry.  People would have found him by now if it were possible to find him.  He covered his tracks pretty nicely it seems.

I believe they failed to register as a money transmitter in the US so USD withdrawals are now being handled manually while that is resolved.  Apparently a lot of people have been waiting MONTHS to get their USD out of Gox and can't stop the transfer (so their money is currently inaccessibly in limbo somewhere).  This is also why the price is so inflated on Gox.
Their site/wiki says they do all types of USD withdrawal but all of them are disabled right now except international bank transfers (the one that's taking months).  It also has a pretty big fee.
I am happy that they are trying and their new engine handled the volume really well.  I think they could be a good exchange again once the withdrawal issue is sorted out.
