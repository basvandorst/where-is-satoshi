They didn't lose it they are just doing what the government requires of them to stay in business. If you have 180k to send to an exchange I would think you would know about financial regulations.  I worked at a financial company before and every 6 months we had to do internal KYC tests and I work in IT with no contact with customers. This stuff is serious for the companies as they can be shutdown by losing their license if they don't comply. At least in the country I live in.

This is everyone giving their BTC to one person and that person keep a ledger of who owns how much of the bitcoin everyone gave him. 
That guy could run and take everyone's money or do the same thing as a bank. Loan out your BTC for profit while hoping that everyone doesn't ask for their BTC back at the same time. 
You better trust that one person and in the world of finance I tend to not trust anyone that hasn't proven they have earned it.

Arbitage keeps the exchanges in the same price range while demand on each exchange is what gives it its price. Demand is shown by looking at the order books. A thin order book to buy usually means demand is over for right  now.   Using price by itself as an indicator shows nothing majority of the time.

I never said that America will always be the lone superpower.  I think taking the whole world down with it is a bit of an exaggeration.  It will cause economic problems for many yes but because Americans think the stability of the world rests in their economy doesn't make it so. Trump putting sanctions on various countries that in turn changed where they sell their product only really effects America. If the American dollar collapsed and the euro became the world reserve dollar all of Europe would benefit.  In a lot of ways what Trump is doing is preparing the world for the collapse of the American dollar by creating new markets for countries to do business with outside of America.

I agree we are all connected but with the way Trump has disrupted trade he has convinced the world to look elsewhere for trade. This will reduce reliance on America which will make trades out side America look better and in a year or two America won't be as important. We are all connected but with the way America is handling itself in the world's eye less and less countries rely on it to a) keep it's word b) rely on it as a stable trade partner.  
A shift away from America will hurt everyone but not nearly as much as it would America. Some places it will be an opportunity as new markets open and products that were not available to some people will suddenly become available.

The ledger is the block chain, stored on nodes run by mining pools and by anyone that wants to run their own. Essentially it is a distributed database that you sync your wallet with.

More miners more hash rate
Difficulty = hashrate * block time. (10 mins for btc)
Eventually electricity cost per hash is to high and the miners stop mining since zero profit.
Hash rate goes down. 
This is why a lot of hashing comes out of China. Govt partner with miners to provide cheap electricity making their cost per hash lower then most others. 
Really no end to electricity used if profit is to be made.  When it's more profitable to put electricity into miners then to power cities it's only a matter of time after btc becomes mainstream that would should really start to see issues.

Not sure what you are getting at. Are you saying that the price of bitcoin will increase so much that it will become the dominate currency? Once that happens the value of the dollar will be be pegged to bitcoin instead of the other way around making the dollar be the one that does the wild swings  eventually leading to hyperinflation of the dollar as the world loses faith in the dollar?
In the end the dollar will be so useless it will not have enough value to buy bitcoin?

Financial companies have laws to follow or they could be fined or shut down. You should look into it if privacy is your concern. The place I  used to work had to keep any financial data for 3 years for one type of customer and 7 years for other types and all data had to be deleted within a reasonable amount of time past the time period to protect customer privacy. They hated doing it because it cost a lot of money to maintain backups and know exactly when to delete which tape without messing up.  If it was up to my company they wouldn't care the minute after they got the money that was owed to them.

If your power company is not run under regulation that they must provide power before mining then they could raises prices to keep in line with the profit of mining so consumers will suffer. I don't think there are any regulations like that now so who knows if there ever will be.  If price of electricity goes up the price of everything goes up. Not to sound alarmist or anything but it is something government's should be considering if they haven't already.

What I meant is if privacy is a concern you shouldn't enter your information then ask what the policy is.  Just some friendly advice.   Just by signing up I'm sure you are part of some info they need to keep regulators/ the taxman from coming down on them.  Any company that sells taking your money in and holding it in trust is basically a bank and an exchange that your deposit money into is kind of like a bank and are held accountable. 
For example you have them delete your info then 2 months from now you sue them saying they took in 10k of your money and now they have no records to prove they didn't because 1) they arbitrarily can delete any data in their system 2) are willing to alter financial data at their customers will. 
Ya you didn't make a trade but how are they going to prove that?  They have to cover their arse just like anyone else.

It's valued in fiat because that's what we can all relate to at this stage.  Should we say 1 bitcoin is worth .01 lambos?  That doesn't help anyone understand the actual value.

If you are American just think if it this way. Your whole life you could have been paid and saved your money in euros.  Every bank in America would exchange them for you so when you need money you could actually spend you just need to go to the bank and covert it.  You could live that way but you'd spend so much time at the bank it would be a waste of time. Why would any one want to do that when they can just pull out their cash or card and be done with it.  
Now think if you are a business. You want to get paid in the currency you pay your bills in or have to convert your money all the time wasting time.
International business is done the same way too.  Commodity markets work on specific currencies. If you want to buy that commodity you need to get that currency from somewhere. If the market is in usd you need to sell stuff to America which prints the currency or another country that pays in usd.  
Until you really need a specific currency to live your day to day life or do business no one cares about your new currency, they already have something that does that. 
Just look at Venezuela.  Before their currency crisis it was just btc hobbyists now it's a thing everyone is using.

Capitalizing random words doesn't make you argument any stronger, just looks like a trump tweet.  
We are still way to early for mass adoption.  The only time people are going to start to understand btc or crypto for that matter is when they are forced to use it for their day to day life. A website or Twitter isn't the real problem. I can go buy $100 worth of play store dollars and then be limited to play store items Unless I want those things the play store has why would I bother. If it is a hassle to get play store dollars and I can get the same thing somewhere else again why would I bother adding an extra step in my life.  
Why is fiat so popular?  It's the only thing you can pay your taxes with and because of that everyone needs it so businesses use it to make their lives easier. Get paid in fiat and pay the Bill's in fiat no hassle. 
The real game changer is when btc is accepted to pay government Bill's or a payment system is put in place that allows for instant conversion from btc to fiat without the receiver having to do anything (crypto credit/debit cards for example). So you can see the problem with mass adoption.

I can't think of an exchange that doesn't have any coin 2 btc pricing but I've seen tons where they don't have any coin 2 USD pricing.   The price of usd is not important in crypto markets so thinking that the prices reflected in usd are the official prices doesn't work. 
The other side of the coin is since the value of each coin is specified in BTC the price of each coin follows the BTC pricing.   Changes in percieved values change the BTC ratio not USD ratio. 
Now to tie it all together. If you want to buy a coin that isn't tradable for USD or you don't live where USD is easily found there is a better chance you can buy BTC for local currency then buy the coin you wanted but could not buy directly. This kind of makes BTC the reserve currency of crypto so it is what all prices are to peg against.

B2B goes through banks and has tons of fees for doing so.  BTC fees are much lower and don't require a third party (the banks) to transfer money. 
Why would a business pay someone else to transfer their money to someone else if they can do it themselves for a fraction of the cost. Businesses do way more wire transfers then consumers do, those banking fees add up quick. 
For example I transferred a sum to a bank from my account. Cost me $50 to do the wire.  I then bought btc with that money and sent it to my wallet for $1.

Long time bitstamp user. Never had a problem and the wire transfers are fast even though the bank is in some country I never heard of.
Their android app isn't the best I've ever used so I ended up having to write my own to be able to use the site the way I want.  Also they have .25% standard trade fee.  Till the end of the year they have reduced fees on ETH trading if you want to dip your toes in that market cheap and try day trading.

It was made when btc hard forked and bch became a thing. The bch people used it to try to convince people bch was the real bitcoin because they believed the way they changed the code was better then what was being called btc. The community rejected the bch guys but the website still exists and tries to convince new adopters they are the real bitcoin.  
Every time a hard fork happens someone can mine the old chain and keep it alive and even upgrade it to work the way they want. Not a bad thing just a thing. The community has voted with its dollars and btc is the real bitcoin.

You should tell them unless your parents are the type that would punish you for doing such a thing. You are young and don't have enough experience to know that if you have a parent that loves and trusts you you shouldn't do anything to break that trust. Very few people in life will support you like a good parent would. Be honest with them and treat them with respect and hopefully they will give that back to you.  
If you were my kid I would only ask you do one thing. Dont leave all your money in crypto. You say you dont want to be a dead beat later in life which is admirable that at such a young age you have put thought into your future. Just remember while you are still a kid take some time to be a kid and have fun. If you end up being a stock trader you will be to busy reading reports and following news to do it later.

Hate how people down vote people for asking questions.  I'm sure it wasn't you.  
I've had the same thought before while doing the math for this and other coins. The best answer I've received is that the amount of decimal places is not set in stone. 
Today there are 8 decimal places per btc but in the future there could be more by forking btc with a hard fork that adds the desired amount of decimal places.  Don't know if it would ever happen but it would be a possible.

That is what a hard fork is. I googled it and got 
Classification. Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency and a payment network. In relation to bitcoin it is characterized variously as a spin-off, a strand, a product of a hard fork, an offshoot, a clone, a second version or an altcoin. The naming of Bitcoin Cash is contentious; it is sometimes referred to as Bcash.
Forked from: Bitcoin

So do you think hodlers are bad for BTC? It's the same thing just where that BTC is sitting is different.   Supply and demand would dictate that the more locked up the higher that value of the circulating currency. 
I think ETF is good. Allows the uninformed a safe secure way to invest in BTC while the knowledgable can make plays without having to go through a bank that charges fees. In my country a financial company has to be insured to offer services to the public. That insurance gives new investors confidence to invest through those companies.  A lot of people I know say that BTC is to complicated to invest in. This will open doors which IMO is a good thing.

Buy yourself a hardware wallet. They do all the setup for you and for the most part keep you secure if you are not 100% sure what you are doing yet. Integrates with your browser for the software side where you will do the send and receive from your wallet. 
One of the points of crypto is to be in charge of your money without some gate keeper between you and your money. If you invest in an institutional fund you aren't in charge.  Also I don't think a fund with crypto can be secured by federal regulations so the extra you would get from putting it in a financial instrument isn't there yet with crypto. 
I own a ledger and it's simple to setup and use.  If you do get one write down the seed on a piece of paper. Get a safety deposit box and put that in the bank. Those 24 words can be used to move your wallet to a new piece of hardware in case of fire or theft. I keep 2 copies, one in a safety deposit box and the other somewhere I feel is safe in case the bank burns down too.

You are sounding like an extremist. Bitcoin is good and will change how the world is run but to think it is going to change everything is a bit much. Govt will always be needed, it's just how that govt is run. Things like fire departments are not money makers and who wants to pay for a fire station if they never have a fire. Without government providing that service through taxation only the rich would get fire stations or the middle class would be extorted when they did have a fire.  The poor would just be out of luck.
