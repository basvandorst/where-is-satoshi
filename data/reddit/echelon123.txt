Stack looks like a really good alternative. The CEO and COO team used to work for Mastercard so they already have a Mastercard partnership.

Are you mining and keeping the BTC, or are you going to rent them out in a cloud mining scheme?  
I can't see how small-scale mining can ever be profitable considering the constant difficulty increases.

Also was this you? I hope so, otherwise your  time required to recoup just increased by 35%

The main problem is that due to difficult increasing, it might become unprofitable before he's earned back the original cost of the hardware.

Except buying bitcoin incurs a 1 - 10% fee, which means I'm losing money. Much easier just to use fiat.

I would compare bitcoin to Gold. You invest in Gold in the hope to sell it on to someone else at a higher price at a later date. Same with stocks.
Are gold and stocks pyramid schemes?
I'd then argue bitcoin is more useful, as you can spend it on several websites for goods and services. Gold and stock you can only sell it (and lose a percentage in the process).

After reading the article, I'm surprised that the "world's most popular bitcoin wallet" only had 120,000 downloads in it's lifetime? I thought Bitcoins was bigger than that..

If you're storing the seed on paper, them why not skip the hardware altogether and just go with a paper wallet?

It's not BTC?

Segwit doesn't increase the blocksize at all - instead it takes all the signatures out of the block and puts them in a second new block. I'd argue that introducing a new block is a bigger change in bitcoin protocol than having a variable blocksize.

For versatility and bang for buck, I recommend the Yamaha PA012.
but if you want ROCK, get the Epiphone Les Paul Special II.
I've owned both btw, both excellent.

Impossible, Chinese miners would know about them by now.

Unofrtunately decentralized exchanges will soon all require KYC.  
Shapeshift already added KYC. IDEX is enabling KYC from today. NEX will require KYC from launch. Kyber doesn't require KYC until your transaction large amounts, so there's that i guess.

Friendly reminder; it's very likely Nick Szabo *is* Satoshi.

a transaction malleability fix is required for a decent, useful LN.
Segwit is one of many proposals for that fix, but it's also one that miners don't like.

Bitcoin is for investing and getting rich, not payments.
