It's only your gains that are taxed, so it can't possibly be more than your total portfolio.

What's wrong with proof of stake?

Because fiat inflates. Bitcoin doesn't and can be easily moved any where in the world.

but if murdering the murderer results in others being a life would they not also be a lifer?

The point is statistically it's almost always relatively high.

Yeah, I was thinking of that. Also [multi-sig wallets](

As they "sell for a devastating loss" everyone would just be buying back cheap coins.

Trailing stops can be dangerous too. Flash crashes can cause you to sell when you really don't want to. Safer to hold.

Here's a good starter:  [

I know pip looks at at this index list for packages to install:  [
I found that shrimpy-python is in the list and referencing the following:  [
That just lists the actual binary files. I'm also curious how to tie this back to the github page. I would think the index would have some kind of breadcrumb back to where it's getting the files from. Probably a good question for a python forum or something.
EDIT: Looks like pip creates a file called "PKG-INFO" that lists the "Home-page" for where the files were retrieved, which in this instance is indeed "[
For example, I downloaded shrimpy\_python-0.0.7.tar.gz, opened it up the with an archive program which had the file in the following directory within the tar.gz: \\dist\\shrimpy\_python-0.0.7.tar\\shrimpy\_python-0.0.7\\PKG-INFO.

10x the capacity generally came with increases in processing speed. For a decentralized system, the processing speed will slow down if all you're doing is increasing the size...

I like this analogy.

It will find a new support at "breaking scouter" which will set the new resistance at "that escalated quickly"
