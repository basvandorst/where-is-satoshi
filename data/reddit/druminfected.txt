this is one of the most informative videos on Bitcoin on what it is and how it works.   Every question you wanted to ask, more likely than not this podcast will answer it for you.  I'm going to be using this podcast as a reference to educate people that are interested in bitcoin.   I think people will understand the video more-so over than reading it.   Educate the masses people!

can't seem to access my wallet even though i know the passphrase and just used it a few weeks ago, so I have no other choice but to seek dave's help.      Really hope he can help, and giving a review would be the least I could do to pay gratitude.

Awesome news!  I've been followring infinitpoker on twitter and have had the Infiniti Poker program installed for months, but it was never open to try even play money, so I'm really looking forward to finally trying this out!   Just curious will BTC be the only form of Cryptocurrency you will accept or LTC as well? 
I've been burnt hard by livebitcoinpoker.com so hope this won't be the same case!     Sealswithclubs is the only Crypto poker site so far that has delivered and trustworthy, but really look forward to seeing what Infiniti Poker can do.
also I have a old infiniti poker program on my computer and it says it needs to upgrade and I click ok and nothing happens. (just stays on the upgrading screen)   I'll try and un/re with the new link here and hopefully that will help.

Lusid, much appreciated on that diagram, its very informative and laid out very well so people not aware of BTC at all will most likely understand it with this helpful illustration. Thanks!

Glad you actually got one, they seem to be shipping theses out like one jalapeño a week now, just to slow IMO.  I've seen jalapeño go for 5 grand on eBay and they don't even physically even have them!

I've actually seen screenshots of people playing poker on the table and each playing having a webcam to see them.   I thought that was pretty awesome and new and innovative.   Hopefully they will deliver!
