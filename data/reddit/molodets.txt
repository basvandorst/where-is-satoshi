And the output was to the same address for both transactions. Doesn't even look like a double spend attempt to me, let alone a successful double spend. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 21:45:43
Of course you are right. He didn't 'forget' to include all those extra, potentially huge fees. It's not rocket science. OP only wants to consider the costs that are convenient for him to consider.

I looked at that example and even that one doesn't look like double spend attempt, never mind a successful double spend. 
The "double spend" transaction was sent 1hr 45mins after the first, and was sent to the exact same addresses. 
Likely someone just increasing a fee on a transaction to help it get into a block.  
@_date: 2018-09-18 11:49:28
If the recipient of the money sees a big flashing warning on his point of sale within 8 seconds of payment saying 'Warning, double spend attempt detected', would you consider that a lame way to prevent double spends? Keep in mind - 1) this is within 8 seconds max, and likely within 1 second, 2) for an online merchant, it could all be automated.

I presume miners would reject the second transaction as invalid if there is already a transaction in their mempool spending those inputs to a different output.
As for the first output being slightly decreased to increase the fee - I agree that's a problem, but don't see how this fits the definition of double spend.

Can you though? Why aren't we seeing successful double spends so? Cryptonize.it even offered a bounty to people who could do it, and nobody could. 
I think on the face of it, the chances of success seem high (I think you wrote 23% in another comment), but in reality, it sounds like too many stars need to align for the chances of success to be high (the chances of X happening are high, but what are the chances of X, Y AND Z all happening?). In particular, it doesn't look like many miners are accepting second transactions with higher fees sent to different destination addresses. They can in theory as you mentioned, but they don't in reality (or at least, don't in any meaningful numbers). Why not? I've no idea, but one possibility is that the short term benefits of making a bit more on a fee are minuscule compared to the long term benefits of having reliable 0-conf on the chain you are mining.
If that reality changed, I would _definitely_ review my stance on 0-conf. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 20:49:24
Huh? The second transaction was included, but it was being sent to the same recipient address as the first transaction. Why would miners even attempt to discard that second transaction?
If it was easy to double spend on BCH, the anti-BCH crowd would have driven it into the ground by now. Look at the other posters on this thread, foaming at the mouth to do it.
@_date: 2018-09-07 21:43:12
By far the most intelligent post in this thread.
@_date: 2018-09-14 16:14:49


So... You wait for 1 confirmation for payments over $2.50? 
@_date: 2018-09-18 16:13:38


I sold all my BTC for BCH back in November after twice paying EUR50+ fees. Worst money transfer experience of my life, and I'm never going back. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 16:07:41
Are you sure those are successful double spends? We looked in detail at an example in an earlier comment thread of this post, and concluded that it wasn't a double spend. 
22% is obviously incorrect. What is the actual figure?
@_date: 2018-09-18 15:54:37
Interesting... Just did a quick google there. Bitpay accepts 0-conf for BCH, but you have to wait for 1 confirmation for BTC. I presume this is because BCH clears the mempool down after each block, and has no RBF. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 09:31:05
Pretty good, looks like they only allow one method of payment though (bitcoin). We'll need to offer multiple payment options (paypal, stripe, etc...). 
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:48:36
Governing body? What are they governing?
@_date: 2014-03-02 08:52:24
This might be too nightlife focused but I've sent them a message to get their opinion on how it might work. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:49:37
Jesus you argue like a 12 year old

Changing how new features are activated is a major change to the protocol. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:43:48
I'll ask again - In your opinion, who is in control of changes and additions to the protocol?
If you're thinking "The Developers", then you have completely missed the point of Bitcoin. A small group of developers doesn't need distributed consensus. They might as well create a centralized web service. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:07:45
Correct me if I'm wrong here but UASF aims to take (at least some) control of protocol changes away from miners. Right?
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:06:18
Boycott - refusing to take something for yourself.
Censorship - preventing others from taking that thing.
Big difference buddy.
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:38:15
From the white paper:


The original creator of bitcoin intended that miners have that power. Who has since then decided that it "wasn't intended"? 
And you're telling me that this is not a major protocol change?
@_date: 2017-05-28 15:15:10
Seriously man, listen to yourself. "Miners have no power", and yet here we are waiting for miners to make a decision on scaling. 
In your opinion, who is in control of changes and additions to the protocol?
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:28:39




Yes, why in the world? There must be only one reason!
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:38:36


What do these alt coins have that bitcoin doesn't? Do they have layer 2 solutions? Do they have Segwit and LN? If not, what do they have that makes these use cases better suited to those alt coins? (serious question)
@_date: 2017-05-29 12:16:20
Ha, you're living in a fantasy land. This UASF crap will be your reality check.
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:55:45


I got into bitcoin many years ago because I was sick of watching central banks and politicians meddling in free markets. The great thing about free markets is that they succeed or fail on their own merit. Creating artificial incentives always warps behaviour, and the result of meddling is often the opposite of what was intended.
Your comment makes me wonder why you are interested in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-16 14:11:17
There is always the possibility that my computer is compromised, but I've done a bunch of transactions today, and this is the only transaction where the coins were immediately forwarded to another address. 
I also just did a test with 12 random words and it worked fine.
So it looks like someone has a db of word combinations as you wrote above. Still trying to figure out how that works though...
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:44:37
Perfectly clear now. Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:01:38
Q1: "you need message (transaction), sig and pubkey to validate that a message (transaction) was signed using a specific private key."
That's clear. But the private key is related to the sender's public key, not the receiver's public key &lt;pubKey&gt;. That's what is confusing me. Natanael_L mentioned that it is for multisig transactions. I'll need to think about that...
Q2: perfect, thanks.
Q3: "Basically all inputs are cleared except for the one where you're sending to. " Not sure what you mean by that... Could you elaborate?
@_date: 2013-06-18 08:24:52
The thing is: if you know the movie title, you can find out the public address. Using that public address, you can trace the transactions back to my other addresses, also allowing you to see how much I hold in my wallet. And all of that will be tied to my reddit username, which could eventually end up with somebody finding out my real life persona.
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:24:41
Now I get it. My confusion was caused by thinking that the ScriptSig and ScriptPubKey from a single transaction are run together. Now I see that, after the ScriptSig from the current transaction is run, it is the ScriptPubKey from the _previous_ transaction that is run. I thought it was the ScriptPubKey from the current transaction. Makes much more sense now.
@_date: 2013-07-04 10:43:09
Will need to play around with it, but glad to see new BTC concepts.
@_date: 2013-06-16 14:46:54
By the way, do you think this would be a problem for normal Bitcoin addresses going forward? At a future time when something like 800 plus terabytes is not a lot, it might make sense for someone to generate a huge number of addresses and private keys and listen to transactions through the API. 
Even if only a really tiny portion of transactions are lost like this, it would introduce uncertainty into each transaction.
@_date: 2013-06-16 14:21:54
Thanks for the detailed info. I get it now.
I used the 4-word title of a well known film.
I could have swapped the words around, or added some typos, but I wanted to see what would happen. I learned something as a result, might prevent me from making an expensive mistake in the future.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:32:24
Hmmm... So the 10 minutes part (or total time to mine x blocks part) is irrelevant in order to decide that a majority of the network worked on it? I mean - we can easily pick one chain over the other based on the amount of computational work used, but neither of those chains were necessarily worked on by the majority...
@_date: 2013-12-29 13:05:03
The difference is that the company would not be able to decide when shares are issued. The shares would be issued at a constant rate and sold immediately (e.g. to the highest bidder). 
@_date: 2013-06-16 14:12:32
Makes sense now, thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-04 12:32:06
We're getting closer... It's a very tricky thought experiment! 
@_date: 2013-06-18 08:33:57
Ya, that's another interesting way to look at this... Is it theft? It's such a new way of transferring value that there is no clear answer to that question.
@_date: 2013-12-04 11:24:07
I'm having trouble getting my head around this...
Is your analogy that writing a page in the book = working on finding a solution to the proof of work problem? In that case, I'm not sure why the page disappears...
@_date: 2013-12-04 12:46:41
The problem with the 51% addition here is that it doesn't work in a distributed system. When everybody is sitting in the same room, it's easy to agree on what's going on. I know I didn't mention that condition in my original post, but let's keep going with it :)
In a distributed system, the only way to know that everyone agrees that everyone agrees (not a typo, I meant to write it twice) is to verify the difficulty of the Proof of Work Chain. By estimating processing power expended in a given time frame, you can conclude that more than 50% of that processing power worked on the same Chain.
Although I guess that if the accountants were distributed, they can agree on a solution by simply accepting that solution and continuing to extend it. 
Now I'm trying to think how they could verify the difficulty of the Proof of Work Chain to know that everyone agrees that everyone agrees.
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:05:56
Interesting... that makes sense, although I'll have to try and find an example.
And thanks for the link. I never thought to look at the code. Could you recommend a place to start? (for a general understanding, not for an understanding of this particular issue) 
@_date: 2013-12-04 12:21:48
Ya, I'm starting to think that it will be very hard to draw an analogy without mathematics, and this works pretty well to describe the mining process.
Even better would be an analogy that makes obvious the need for +50% resources working on the problem (i.e. an analogy that will fit into the "Byzantine General's problem" story).
This is not as easy as I expected :)
@_date: 2013-06-16 15:39:22
Well then, that settles it.
@_date: 2013-12-04 10:47:35
That makes sense... And the item that is detected contains information about the next problem? (e.g. "Next, go and look in Field X".)
Now I see a couple more difficulties in creating this analogy: 
* The problem has to be equally accessible to all. (Will each participant in the proof of work scheme be in the same Field / haystack / cakestack? Or will they each have identical Fields / haystacks / cakestacks?)
* The solution has to be easily verifiable by all. (How can each participant quickly confirm that the solution found is the correct one?)
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:33:16
Sorry - I meant "chain that most people worked on" not "block that most people worked on".
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:01:26
I like the idea of having to search for something. Using photos is also interesting... The concept of distributing randomly and shuffling instantaneously seem a bit... magical though. And I guess if you can be sure that the photos can't be counterfeited, you could achieve your information sharing goals in much easier ways than proof of work. 
But you've given me an idea about a "colour dictionary" - easy to find a colour if you have the page number, but hard to find the page number if you have the colour. I'll think about it a bit more and update this post...
@_date: 2013-06-16 16:00:56
@_date: 2013-06-16 13:43:37
It did occur to me when I generated the address from the 4 dictionary words that somebody else might have used the same words. So I searched for the generated address on blockchain.info before using it, but the address was not present. 
Is there another way to check that your brain wallet address is not being "watched" before you use it?
And how does somebody set up a watch anyway?
