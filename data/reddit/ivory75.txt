What you think about the actual situation of the market:
1) Korea, China decision - France Germany - next G20 on March (governments) 
2) bitcoin futures speculation 
After the dip now we have recovered and is flowing in the middle —&gt; whats’ next —&gt; another bigger dip or a moves to a bull market?  Really don’t know !

We all will get used to this boring dip - connected with a lot of people that will sell - for speculation and future ending 
Scenario 1 
1) people will get used and more people will sell and the dip will be every time bigger and the recovery will be every time smaller - (look that 835 max market cap is not reached since January 7) and we all get fuxxx and the market is dead in less than a year.
2) something else should happen (what? Any idea?)

Was a fake news 2 moths old - that create this dip so- I suggest to buy - in these days korean exchange are opening access to new users - .....

Unfortunately after a long period of love with btc she decided to quit with me and I was obliged to take a new girl, this time I choose one that is like her but younger faster and cheaper (every dinner I have to pay ;))and with the same name...strange but I started this new relationship a week a go and I am really happy. Sometimes is better change that don’t move.

@_date: 2017-11-12 06:02:59
Sometimes you have only 2 choices in life
1) sell and jump on the new boat 
2) see your gain falling and sinking and pray 
I think that this process is inevitable 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:59:29
By what I can see is not a pump and dump but is just the begging of a slow decrease of btc and a good increase with good profit for bch 
This process will stop the first time when it will be at the same price around 3500 usd. 
Then there will be the surpas. 
Has been decided month a go not by us but by who want the better for the grow of their money and I think also for the crypto space.

This girl -- and other analyst on you tube are saying that the market now is on bubble again and that btc eth all will go deep again to march level- the give also as support this video.
I can't and don't want believe that will be like that - 
But if yes - we all should be sell now - to not loose our money - 
I was wondering another time and different world so I don't want to believe.
The only response it will be if BTC and the market cap will go back to 117 and will not drop again. 
May be we are living a different time -
ANY IDEA?
@_date: 2017-07-22 19:03:32
I am looking to a tons of video on YouTube - looking everywhere on reddit - and more.
I am just looking reading and listening people analysis. 
And the most of them seems to me going for another drop of bitcoin. Also Ethereum will drop again. 
So I am not now investing any money. 
I now is not good see all the altcoins going up and have money not invested, but buying now near the maximum of the market cap (117) is not so smart for ME.
I will buy only when I will see all red on coinmarket cap like last Sunday.
If not - I will not invest and will stay with few ICN and see what will happens with the platform release.
And may be one day there will be a big drop again...it happened 3 times from may - one every months - do you think that will neve happen again?
If yes I will be happy with my ICN if not I will have time to by more. 
Who will decide are whales and sharks, not me.
@_date: 2017-07-23 19:09:41
No - loose money also if you can loose it is not good. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 19:14:07
Aha ok grazie!
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:50:44
I can't hold on something that I paid 2400 euro if it will go back to 1000 euro in the following week - 
This is what are saying many many analysts - there will be another crash bigger than the last one - 
I hope no but - they convinced me - the charts and the graphics are quite explanatory.
@_date: 2017-07-23 11:05:56
So what? 
@_date: 2017-07-20 11:31:59
Really? Are you sure? 
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:34:12
Do you think that now is all fine and solved with bitcoin so we don't expect any crash from now to beginning of august?
@_date: 2017-07-23 10:16:11
How you comment the analys that compare 2013-2014 with now? People on you tube by the graphs shows that will be a dip to 25 mln market cap for years 
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:13:04
Wait - it will drop back again in few hours or days
@_date: 2017-07-23 06:09:58
If it all Is solved like it seems why it could drop back again?
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:08:13
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:33:10
I have the same issue - I have euro to invest and I was hoping for a crash but nothing is happening right now - we are getting back to 100 --&gt; and more - I am quite Halley because I have some icn so I am not completely out - but it was better to see a crash --unfortunalety it seems that we will never see again bitcoin low at 1600.
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:01:50
She is -
At the end - following his advice I sold 3025 icn and rest with 2000 - I did not loose - but if the shark whale and soo on will repeat the same thing of last Sunday 
I will loose less - 
If she and others are wrong - market will go up again to 115 and more and I will be happy with 2000 icn --may be not the same revenue - but is better to risk less - and may be if the price of icn go below 2.26 that is my now average  I can buy more.
For now - is better to see - if all this analyst say something correct - I want to give them a try - also because I don't trust I this last pump from 60 to 98 in 1 week - 
May be another trap is behind the corner -
If not -- I have some icn -
