I contacted other banks and discussed with up to a friendly general director. I was told that the decision making body, what they call "operation", judge that there is a monetary risk serving clients dealing with Bitcoin, mostly in relevance to Fraud, and since they are not legally obligated to serve business clients, unlike personal accounts, they are actively refusing and closing service/accounts. Supposedly it has to do with difficulty in proving the provenance (paper trail). And also I quote the director; "They are banks, it's a risk, banks don't take risks." It does sound legit to me, albeit also a convenient reason to boycott bitcoins. I'll just wait and see if crypto crushes "the banks", we'll see if i emerge victor or not in the end.

Of course there was no law passed. To me it sound like the agent was directed to terminate my account, and to notify me, without being provided justifiable grounds to do so; he improvised.

I think Desjardins isint quite a Bank, which is why they were willing to help in the first place.
My actual bank said they won't give me any sort of credits, even if its from transferring personal, existing credits, to business services until my company is 2 years of tax returns old.
Still, Desjardins even terminated my standard, non credit, business banking account over this. I guess i may need to get a benign, featureless business account from my personal BANK...

Heh, sign me in. I understand inaction, but this is them seeking out and putting some effort to go against something. They probably tell themselves it's to fight fraud and money laundering, but being purely legitimate here, i am being suppressed without regards.

Well they're not stopping me per se, just refusing to give me business related services that would help?
