I was super worried too at the end of december when I cashed out some btc too. I would wait until the end of the week and expect this email I got:
Your withdrawal with code ******** started on 2017-12-17 for an amount of ** EUR is delayed while we work through our backlog.
Please note that your funds are safe but it may take up to 10 days for them to reach your bank account.

It can be used for anything that gives importance to data, databases and fraud.
For example, there are people in the auto industry that are working on a distributed ledger that tracks info about cars (how many miles, what kind of repairs they went through... etc...) so in the future it would be super hard to lie when selling your used car. I think it's brilliant.

Localbitcoins or ATMs. Higher fees but no verification.

You can put them on an Exchange (GDAX...) and send them to your bank account. Takes a few days.
Then there's localbitcoins to sell directly to people. You decide how and how much.

The strongest mindset in this forum is the "HODL" (or hold) philosophy. Many think that you will have greater results by holding than day trading or trying to short the market. 
In my case, that was true. I tried to sell high and buy low many times a day, but lack of experience, lack of patience and panic will make you take wrong decisions over and over and you'll notice you maybe shouldn't have done that...
But anyways, I think volatility is pretty high and there's not a way to predict what will happen. Just bare in mind that you're asking a tough question to a polarized audience.

Credit card on Coinbase, 4% fee (which is huge) or localbitcoins (which is usually expensive)

People have reputation / trust points like on ebay. The platform acts as an escrow who holds the bitcoins until transaction is confirmed. 
Also, some people will also sell you btc for cash in public places (starbucks, mall...). I personally never bought anywhere else than on GDAX.

Helvetica is a very popular sans serif font created by Haas Type Foundry in Switzerland. It was once in OSX yes, but I think it has switch to SF Display, or at least on iOS.

Not a scam. Coinbase is SUPER convenient and let's you buy bitcoin in a straightforward way.
As in convenience stores, prices are higher but you get your product quickly and with no hassles. Perfect for newbies and mom who wants a piece of the pie.
If you want to chose your price, try their other website GDAX. No guarantees and price locks. You can set your limits and if they're never reached, you'll never get your coins. It's cheaper and fee-less though.
