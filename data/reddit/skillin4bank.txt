Intentions of the people in charge is just as important as the tech facts behind said coin.
"Why this is a scam: Intentionally trying to confuse the community......stop there, that 6 words is enough to send up red flags all over and prompt me to make less rash decisions and more research before making a decision. (obviously the extensive research should of been taking place already, but newbs will be newbs)..
I see your point - the professionalism was lacking..BUT it is absolutely paramount that it be known how misleading/malicious(call it as it is) the BCH community/founders/shillers can be, immediately - when newbs are at risk. 
Whether its professional or not.. the attempt at a warning is better than nothing at all. Better to be part of a solution than to sit there and do nothing. I have all the respect in the world for people who call out scams for face value. 
I dont know about everyone here, but to me, newbs getting owned, whether their own fault or not...It puts a bad taste in my mouth... I was that newb at one point and so were you... Would you not of appreciated someone prompting you before a possible huge mistake? Especially one related to your finances and scams possibly beyond your lenses. 
The bottom line is that all of this shit is terrible for the entire industry, especially one that is getting such a bad wrap for scams and sketchy activity on all fronts. We are fighting an adoption war and coins/companies/people who back these fraudsters are bad for the environment as well. The sooner we weed out and expose these culprits the better for the entirety of this market.

Thank you! Speaking my mind for me!
You're bang on, call it as it is. Face value
