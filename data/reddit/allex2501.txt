I do. You can look in Leandros owner of MB and Founder profile on Bitcointalk you can see some of the people they own.
ThiagoCMC they have to pay 2200 BTC.
Just to remind everyone what was "stolen" in march was MB Wallet. So regardless where the clients belongs Rain or MB. The owner or owners are responsible. They are try to detach themselves from what happen by saying that MB clients were payed but this is a silly move. 
@_date: 2013-06-01 04:12:57
is a shame, because the Idea is quite good. But I hope people use this post to talk about their services 
@_date: 2013-05-06 01:30:47
So why this isn't on Bitcointalk "Important Announcements"?
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:02:31
satisfactory explanations? you and L. push some Mickey Mouse version of what happen to the the community since march and now you are trying to pose your self as respectable people. 
No, u did not pay every single one! Don't Lie. 
There is no comercial fight going on!! only people asking for money that you guys own or better say stole.
Just pay what u guys own and all the discussion will be over.
You gonna end up in court or even better in Jail

I think the easy way would be trying to get as much BTC as possible on P2P network. After trying on few exchanges. Is not hard to it but but it would take few days.
@_date: 2013-07-29 17:25:50
I Know that. The question is: What is the best way to calculate price. What would be best reference , if there is one. As Mtgox is not the big dog no more
@_date: 2013-11-04 12:56:55
I think you Meant We can't take his word for it! As he did not pay lots of people Including a friend of mine Thiago which they own 2200 BTCs
@_date: 2013-06-10 14:51:56

At this point in the Beta process is just a data nothing else. I dont have any intention of commercialised it or do anything with the names. But if u feel that asking for the name been a compulsory field a bit out of line, we would consider a change from compulsory to optional.
