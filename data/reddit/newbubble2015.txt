Bread Wallet is fantastic. Highly recommended.
@_date: 2015-05-11 02:40:28
@_date: 2015-05-03 18:58:59
Why not discuss it with your moron buttcoin friends?
@_date: 2015-05-03 18:06:58
Just sayin' might want to get something more stylish when they are available. Nice p/u though.
@_date: 2015-05-11 20:33:20


&lt;tinfoilhat&gt; ...but that's exactly the opposite of what they want to do&lt;/tinfoilhat&gt;
@_date: 2015-05-21 22:32:49
Is this satire?
@_date: 2015-05-05 23:36:01
Armory, Electrum, Bread Wallet.
@_date: 2015-05-03 16:02:07
I guess you had to manipulate your votes  overnight to save your ass. Pathetic dolt.
@_date: 2015-05-03 17:35:49
This sub is such an overrun shithole.
@_date: 2015-05-09 18:14:31
Rules are made to be changed. If a new mod keeps the old rules in place, they become responsible for those rules. 
@_date: 2015-05-02 21:41:24
bitcoin main currency, litecoin is bitcoins silver, monero is for anonymous transactions...and another few thousand alts hardly used. 
@_date: 2015-05-03 17:16:26
It was fucking buttcoiners they linked to my posts... aka your buds.
@_date: 2015-05-02 20:27:42
Lmao, if you were actually *not* a shill, you would have already written me off as a troll and stopped responding. The fact that you keep responding let's me know what I say has meaning to you. Any other sane person would not be giving this much attention to someone they perceived as a troll. Way to dig your own grave.
Oh, and stop with the carrot stuff. It's downright embarrassing I don't care who you are shill or not. 
@_date: 2015-05-02 17:50:37
Not even worth responding to. I know how shills always act and counter and never ignore a reply. You aren't worth my time. 


Well jee aint that the perfect cover. 
edit: you will probably respond criticizing me of my argument as a way to discredit me. I'm not here to argue with shills. 
@_date: 2015-05-03 20:50:29
Lmao that aint worth 20 bucks.
@_date: 2015-05-09 15:57:21
I don't like creating and then having to pre load a changetip account. Not to mention no privacy when using it. I don't use changetip but would be much more apt to tip addresses directly.
@_date: 2015-05-02 09:18:14
Not even. That's just downright disrespectful. 
@_date: 2015-05-09 15:53:22
He's wrong.
@_date: 2015-05-02 19:31:35




You're literally a complete joke to me. It's like you have the shill handbook on your desk and are going right off it. Oh, by the way, don't respond to me. Shills can't stand that.
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:35:29
@_date: 2015-05-03 17:50:22
Nice but looks like shit with that stock blue rubber band.

They can be tiny but increase size by hovering.
@_date: 2015-05-02 16:55:27
Lmao I was just doing that actually. He definitely is one there is absolutely no doubt in my mind. As someone who has dealt with them in the past, it is completely obvious. Implementing all the techniques in the book. 
@_date: 2015-05-01 16:58:05
So if Mormons or Catholics accepted bitcoin you would have became one of them?
@_date: 2015-05-06 22:22:39
Okay, so you are coming to a post about learning how to make paper wallets and then telling people not to learn how to make paper wallets...thanks for your contribution.
@_date: 2015-05-09 19:20:13
Fair enough, but I don't see that as a good enough reason. If the individual knows what they are doing it's not a problem.
@_date: 2015-05-02 17:05:26


Other than blatant alt hate, dash is a known instamine scamcoin and sdc is a pos coin. Monero is intriguing though. 
@_date: 2015-05-12 01:08:40
@_date: 2015-05-02 20:02:46
Typical shill maneuvers...changing the subject, shifting focus from you to me, criticizing my intelligence etc.
Your carrot comment is basically shilling 101. 
Anymore? This is actually quite entertaining how you keep on responding to me. Apparently what I have to say about you being a shill is obviously of great importance. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 18:53:32


No it's because you're a fuckin 1 hour account buttcoin moron troll
@_date: 2015-05-11 20:37:07
I guess you prefer rehashed blog spam articles. 
@_date: 2015-05-11 18:06:07
Just use offline/cold Electrum for long term holdings and an Electrum hot wallet for spending btc.  
@_date: 2015-05-03 20:16:40
LOOK AT THIS GRAAAAAPH
@_date: 2015-05-02 19:55:13
It's really sad you shills always need to have the last damn word when you feel you are being exposed. If I'm such a repetitious drone who offers nothing why in the fuck do you keep replying to me? Oh, that's right, you are told to and do so out of fear that other readers will believe me and catch on. 
@_date: 2015-05-09 15:55:04
I know youre a butt troll but I agree with you on this.
@_date: 2015-05-07 18:16:30
Don't worry, I would have never mistaken this with an AP post. This is far from AP quality. 
@_date: 2015-05-03 18:15:18
Give it a couple years....you'll be wearing one.  
@_date: 2015-05-02 19:48:08


@_date: 2015-05-08 16:20:36
Nice list. I will add Armory to it. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 22:02:52
You could donate it and immediately get the satisfaction of helping others. 
@_date: 2015-05-03 18:50:23
So? Eventually they will realize they are using a joke coin that went to far and now only kids use and will move to bitcoin.  
@_date: 2015-05-02 16:35:36


You sound like one.
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:19:03
Use Monero.
@_date: 2015-05-03 20:51:28
Why not check yourself to see if he received it?
Yep, looks like he got it. 
@_date: 2015-05-09 15:51:46
This. Wtf ?? Don't give wrong/bad advice.
@_date: 2015-04-28 00:05:59
@_date: 2015-04-21 20:14:04
The next few hours are critical.
@_date: 2015-04-15 22:27:52
Use Coinbase for buying or selling bitcoin only. You should store your coins on another wallet on your computer such as Electrum or Armory (Bread Wallet for iOS and Mycelium for Android). If storing a large amount you will need to look up how to set up these wallets for cold storage. You can also opt to purchase a hardware wallet, such as Ledger, to store your coins which is similar to cold storage, but known as "warm storage". Then all you have to do is generate an address on your wallet and use the send feature on Coinbase to send them to that address.

QR code scanning?
@_date: 2015-04-24 00:03:18
Lol yeah you would want another 26k to put in if it drops. Best to just hodl. I feel the same way only reason haven't bought more.
@_date: 2015-04-30 17:22:58
Woulda coulda shoulda
Edit: article sucks too
@_date: 2015-04-19 17:35:08
An article about a reddit post....just lol.
@_date: 2015-04-22 07:37:51
This is awesome!
@_date: 2015-04-26 14:58:23
Saw first one and noped on out. Downvoted.
@_date: 2015-04-27 17:18:58
Just switch to Litecoin then if you don't like it.

You aren't thinking globally enough. This is 2015. Bitcoin is the beginning of the end of countries as we know them. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 17:27:12
You are essentially being a buttcoiner for alts. Stop. Bitcoin (aka the sole coin you use) isn't the only crypto. Dealwithit.jpg
@_date: 2015-04-25 22:51:38
Didn't know that. Too bad gold is essentially just a donation to reddit though.

Repost I swear m8. OP is a troll.
@_date: 2015-04-25 22:33:20
No. I don't want money to sway peoples comments. Worthless invisible internet points make things bad enough already. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 18:07:42


Saw this part. Looked like the other guy was looking at him like "dude wtf are saying?". Anyway I only watched a small portion and that was part of it. Stopped watching after that.

@_date: 2015-04-21 21:01:09


Yes, it's bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 06:00:27

@_date: 2015-04-20 20:15:46
No, I don't think there's a reason to listen to ron paul.

@_date: 2015-04-21 00:43:46
Armory is the GOAT. I also like Electrum. Bread Wallet for iOS and Mycelium for Android. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 04:52:34
They also both offer an offline feature for cold storage. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 23:35:16
Nothing positive at all in here? At least OP is trying to do a damn thing.
@_date: 2015-04-24 16:21:20

That was your mistake. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 17:46:10


That's a personal opinion. Inherently, Trezor is no safer at all.
@_date: 2015-04-22 17:35:27
Try posting in buttcoin
@_date: 2015-04-30 03:55:01

@_date: 2015-04-27 21:45:08
Coinbase will follow, buy buy buy!
@_date: 2015-04-22 00:42:04
The attack still lets the 2fa be sent and entered. You can use their "vault" to help with that but you still aren't protected for the reasons others have mentioned. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 00:04:26
How did you create an offline wallet.dat?
@_date: 2015-04-27 22:32:02

@_date: 2015-04-21 20:17:40
People who want bitcoin to not be volatile anytime in the near future are gonna have a bad time...
@_date: 2015-04-14 21:10:51
Paper wallets or offline wallet such as Armory. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 20:01:38
So pretty much the backbone of finance? Awesome.
@_date: 2015-04-21 19:25:16
The media just doesn't want the public to fully understand bitcoin yet. That's all. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 21:07:51


it was actually like $2. Check the chart again, it dips below the $5 mark. That makes a huge difference. The dips on bubbles are getting less and less.
@_date: 2015-04-26 00:09:01
Well I guess why not then lol?

@_date: 2015-04-28 19:08:34
Paste the key in bitaddress.org wallet details and get the uncompressed format then import that into your wallet.
@_date: 2015-04-27 17:13:14
Dumbest fucking logic of all time.
@_date: 2015-04-25 23:04:07


Yeah, that's kind of going back to my original point. I guess the gold kind of works well in that sense then. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 17:44:02
This thread is in r/dogecoin too if you want to share a comment with those people.

@_date: 2015-04-30 17:44:31
@_date: 2015-04-21 03:14:49
Then neither does bitcoin with that logic.

I hope you don't believe you are safe if you get phished or pick up some malware that robs your account. You won't get your coins back.

Yes, I think I do lol.

Early adopters get rewarded for believing in the network and that's the way it's supposed to work.

Or just hodl.

@_date: 2015-04-27 18:45:39


Umm, no.
@_date: 2015-04-14 23:40:41
Litecoin and Monero are the only alts I hold long term. I still believe LTC is silver to BTC gold and is faster so it has a place. XMR is the superior anonymous coin and has a place alongside BTC. Both were also fairly launched and have solid communities. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:59:41


When did you start buying? What was your lowest and highest buy prices? That's a great position. What are
Your preferred storage methods?

+1 Armory is GOAT!
@_date: 2015-04-26 02:51:10
Armory and Electrum have my vote.
@_date: 2015-04-17 16:46:13
More like Masterbutthurt amiright?
@_date: 2015-04-24 22:00:42

@_date: 2015-04-25 22:41:23
You're on the right track though. This type of thing will be incorporated somewhere in one fashion or another at some point. I could potentially see a tip button in addition to upvotes/downvotes that just takes one click and will tip whatever amount you have preset. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 20:44:18
This is the beartrap before the bubble. Just sayin'.
@_date: 2015-04-19 17:42:49
I prefer paper wallets and offline wallets like Armory to any hardware wallet around today.
@_date: 2015-04-22 01:27:15
Not funny and not for the reason you think. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 03:43:31

@_date: 2015-04-20 18:27:08

No, not interested in lame marketing gimmicks/excuses to create the most link baity titles in existence that will just end up wasting peoples time. That stuff hasn't been funny for years, it has become an annoyance. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 18:22:42
Why are you still here?
@_date: 2015-04-26 14:54:46


No stats, but I'm willing to bet the opposite of this is true.
@_date: 2015-04-30 04:49:16
Will do. Also, was just kidding around with my comment btw.

@_date: 2015-04-25 23:59:40
Well if we are talking upvotes and satoshis that would mean fractions of pennies per upvote. That's not enough to make people change how they upvote that much. In another case, I can see your point though. I just think proper implementation to keep nuthuggers at bay is key. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 19:32:33
Dumbest fucking logic of all time.
@_date: 2015-04-30 17:20:48
Create an Electrum wallet offline with a Linix live disc like Ubuntu or Tails. Then copy the master public key to an online machine. You can sign transactions offline. Don't forget to keep your seed safe too.
@_date: 2015-04-20 18:58:19
He's been saying this since the '80s. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 17:48:13
Seed + hardware = additional levels of vulnerability.
@_date: 2015-04-18 21:15:55
Sweet thanks for the answer. Armory and Electrum are awesome wallets too I recommend. I wouldn't store coins on blockchain.info though. You will be rewarded one day for risking your federal debt notes to support bitcoin early on.
