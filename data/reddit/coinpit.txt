Thanks for the illustration.


Is there anything that prevents a small miner from mining blocks of that size? How would a small miner "fall behind" unless we assume big miners are getting every block?

The earliest adopter nations would be those who have an incentive to get out of the currency business.
Various African countries, micro-island nations and any new countries (such as [Liberland]( ) would be the first since they don't really have a lot of commerce involving national currencies.
Countries where currency is a primary business such as the United States, UK, Various Euro-zone members and Switzerland would be very late adopters, if ever.
Countries with a tight control on money such as China are wildcards. 
Bitcoin is still very new technology and it needs to be mainstream and scale to very high TPS before it will be adopted by any major nation.

We have spoken to US regulators about the possibility of offering in the US. 
This is doable, but expensive, time consuming and while there is no guarantee, our system of provable compliance and modeling the system after US regulation may make it easier to get an approval. 
If we get sufficient demand from USA traders, we may prioritize it.
