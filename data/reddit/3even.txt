Spend some of those coins on a gun.

Looking forward to this!

Off topic, but the best part is at 17:14 when Peter rants about some idiot analyst from Citigroup. LOL

Still waiting for my invite..lol

My thoughts exactly. Anyway, there are much better alternatives to Bitpal :)

Currently have an API for Bitcoin. Will support Litecoin, Namecoin and Dogecoin soon.

The absurdity of this subreddit and its users never fails to impress. You didn't realize that you had no control over that address after you first sent 300 coins to it? Then decided, what the hell, let me send another 800 to it!? 
I have a sneaking suspicion that many of Bitcoin's early adopters and miners will be penniless before the decades out.
@_date: 2014-05-17 01:06:16
Haters gonna hate. I believe many feel that serious developers should be running there own instance of bitcoind instead of relying on a centralized service like chain.com etc...

Andreas never fails to impress. Bravo!

He predicted the 2008 crash and has made 100's of millions of dollars for himself and his clients. He was also appointed as economic adviser to Ron Paul's 2008 presidential campaign.
What have YOU done? Take your time, I'll wait.

Agreed that the video quality is never great on JRE but the audio is more than satisfactory.

What's so "interesting" about this distribution of email providers? Looks pretty standard to me.
@_date: 2014-01-28 05:24:31
Funny seeing that it is one of Bitcoin's easier concepts to grasp.

Kudos to Jesse for this disclosure. Hopefully it won't come back to bite him in the ass.

Comparing Gox to BTC-E is a stretch. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 00:46:53
I've always felt there was confusion between the original Ripple protocol and the company that acquired it. Glad to hear confirmation from Andreas.

It's not Gavin that's against the implementation of a larger (8MB) blocksize limit into core. It's the devs that work for Blockstream who are stalling. By pushing the [redacted] fork, Gavin is forcing the community at large to make a choice. The Blockstream devs will never, on their own accord, allow a blocksize increase as it threatens the profitability of their employer/business model.

Yes and not only did they close source the app but they never gave back the donations. Glad they bit the dust.

Great read. Many parallels between the noobs on carding forums and those on blackhat SEO forums. I swear it's like they can't give their money away fast enough.

The deliberate and incremental "dumbing down" of North Americans continues. Homeschooling and self-directed learning has never been more important.

Great timing on the purchase.

Please correct me if I'm wrong. One can only use these Coinkit debit cards at merchants who have a Coinkit POS system?

Looks like BTC its stabilizing at around $500 now. This is still more than 25x the price I bought in at.
@_date: 2013-11-11 16:39:35
If I buy and deploy 10, 50 or 100 of these kiosks, am I bound to using your website or will you provide me the web application code so that I may run it on my own infrastructure?
