No. But that's what it looks like in my head.

Rumor says this insided paper was dated to 20th Nov. So it's old news, for FUD purpose only, surprisingly.
Now we'll have to wait for the next ban announcement, unfortunately.

Some of them are still operating for foreign customers. And a few are currently providing otc platforms. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:50:39
Finally, it's banned.
@_date: 2018-05-17 01:22:51
It's useful though to judge when to sell.

If you'll have to install many other apps on the phone for daily use, I don't think it's safe to keep your coins on the same phone with so many other apps.

The other two exchanges OKCoin and Huobi said at start that their withdrawing dates are in one month. 
BTCC said theirs was within 10 days. And now they suddenly issued another announcement before 10 days is due and also the new date is in another month. PBOC is some manipulative bully. BTCC is even worse. Besides if they can change this at will what's the point of giving a date today. Why do I have to explain it like you are 5?

Or their moms tell them to and they are trying to be respective to moms. BTW, don't say "they". Relax and say "we".

You need to understand chinese though. Here's the video of PBoC meeting.

Hello, it is said in the other thread that we can make a new wallet and send the coins there after fork.
I am not sure if it's OK now to send the coins to the new wallet or we'll have to wait for the first BCH block to be mined (said to be stuck atm?).
Not sure how one is supposed to send the old wallet's BCH to kraken, as electron wallet seems to be not recommended by electrum devs, saying the wallet dev is anonymous.

Link plz?

Thanks for sharing and sorry for the loss. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 01:53:43
You guys either go too far or go FUD.
This is generally a good sign but it goes too far by calling it legitimize. 
Can you be rational for a second? Above all, caring not what China is doing is what btc needs

You can always find a random event to explain a surge or drop. You can however never explain why a certain event hadn't caused a surge or drop.
Not saying that we should not try to explain, I mean who knows whether it is indeed the reason.
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:36:40
Now I am more confused why you guys start to call it an FUD. There was a post saying it's bullish news that it was caused by mt.gox. 
I am not sure if it's bullish or bearish news for the mt.gox sale, but it's not FUD?
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:12:54
They do. OTC selling is driving the market down. Can't you see?
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:57:36
I don't get it. Why a stupid meme post can get a few k up votes, and this gets less than 1k.
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:26:11
Are you Chinese to talk like an expert about what's"really"happening? You are delusional, especially by the use of Hong Kong as an example.  The media is completely controlled in the country and you can see how it's only a tool to brainwash and manipulate. Their have been several state media articles telling people why "bitcoin is no good at all".
Despite your encouraging opinion, you are only joining their manipulative agenda. Also, yours so called "insight" is just a guess at best. What people should do is ignoring China, both fud and the "exciting" news, which seems hard to accomplish.
@_date: 2018-02-13 09:36:23
Hence he's wrong about China reopening CC exchanges?
@_date: 2018-02-16 08:39:24
Althoug I'm generally long for bitcoin and wish it succeeds in the end, prices going up is not really a legit retort to the bitcoin naysayers. You are basically doing the same like those shouting out "bitcoin is dead" everytime it takes a dive.
@_date: 2018-02-25 09:52:35
bitcoin.org is down?
@_date: 2018-02-16 07:35:42
I'm completely confused. Is the purpose of bitcoin solely for pumping and get rich?
Don't get me wrong. I want to get rich but posts like this getting 10K upvotes seems a sign to sell, at least for short term.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:42:03
If you are caring about if some third world countries are banning bitcoin, you should not invest in bitcoin. You may get arrested for that. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 06:22:46
Now every time I read institutional money, I wanna sell hard.
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:25:43
It seems you know nothing about China, but have some wishful thinking. In short,  if you're excited about news from China, you are the one who gets FUDed by China as well. Harsh but true.
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:30:18
I foresee another OTC bitcoin ban announcement from PBOC, and cause a major panic, again
@_date: 2018-07-15 23:20:37
And yet most exchanges don't support segwit.

I am from Venezuela. Do you think I should keep my wealth in my native currency or bitcoin. I think the thing backed up by my government is definitely better?
@_date: 2016-07-31 03:25:37
I heard it is about the people with BTC future contract settlement day in the weekend. It is also the end of the month.
It does confirm when you check the price drop in every recent weekend.
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:13:52
Please approve it. I really wanna dump my dumb money on the institutional smart money. People have been telling me that's our plan.
@_date: 2017-06-24 04:55:00
As "everyone" seems to be having problems, I may want to add that I have not had a single issue so far with them. Did some btc transfer yesterday and it went instant.
