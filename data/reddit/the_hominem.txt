Banks HATE this one wierd trick!
@_date: 2019-11-29 02:27:37
None of my friends or family know I have bitcoin. 
It's not my responsibility to communicate to them the value of it. 
I'm not an accountant or a faniacial advisor and I, just like everyone else, have a limited grasp on the future this world is heading into, and am in no position to guide or in any way influence their financial decisions.
If they want to have a decision on what it is and how it works, I'm all ears. But I will ever say that I own it and that they should too.

I'm with ANZ and use pay ID for coinjar, have had no issues with the bank expect my first transaction where they froze my account for 24 hours because they said they thought the pay ID for coinjar "wasn't reputable". Turned out perfectly fine and since then each transaction has gone through censorship-free instantly.

In a not-so-conspiracy-theory way I agree with you. I don't think powerful people got together to create bitcoin, and I don't really think they encourage it per se, but I absolutely agree that:
1. People's public option on controversial things especially around money are very different to what they practice in private.
2. Wealthy, powerful people who will do anything to keep it that way absolutely have their eyes on bitcoin, even if they don't hold any, as a potential life-raft for the sinking world economy. And you better believe they have access to information that would allow them to firmly establish their position in bitcoin well before everyone else does if and when they know it will be a sure thing.
In other words: I don't think peole in positions of power are breaking a sweat at the current economic crissises. If anything, they are excited for a wealth transfer that they will see coming months or years before the masses have a chance to get on board. 
But I don't think they planned on (or are pushing for) bitcoin per se.

In Australia im almost certain you only pay tax when you convert to fiat, and then you pay tax on it as if you "bought" those forked coins for $0
Which makes sense.
Not an accountant though.

Yeah I had to re-read it a couple times and I don't think he used it correctly. 
More accurately, YOU have sovereign rule over your own money - no one can seize, censor, limit or direct it in anyway. 
There's no one you report to, and theres no one that can change the rules to make it otherwise without your consent. It's just as if you were the king of your own wealth, with not one soul sitting above you, as it should be.

What happens when the price is too high and no one is buying any more because its not worth it?
It's a non-sensical question, the price is necessarily worth what people are paying, if not it will go down - just like the work to mine is necessarily worth the reward, it is designed to adjust difficulty until it is worth it.
@_date: 2019-10-24 10:29:32
You buy today, and then in 7 days and then in 7 days after that and so on in that fashion consistently with what ever percentage of your pay you are willing to part with and still be able to comfortably live your life.
(Or fortnightly or monthly, what ever works best for you)

How do miners guess the nonce value?
Is it as simple as starting with the number 1 and adding until the hash produces the number of leading 0s necessary? Or is it pick a random number each time? If that was the case then how do asics make sure theyre not wasting energy gusssing a random number that has already been guessed?

There's 12.5 btc created roughly every 10min.
There's 144 10min intervals in a 24 hour day
That's 1800 btc created each day and presumamably sold for roughly $7000 ea or $12,600,000 per day.
Even more as the price increases. So that much needs to enter the market each day for the price to stay the same is all he means.

I reckon we go for a more imperial measurement approach.
We could have 8 sats in a satchel 
16 satchels to a bittle 
3 bittles to blockard
1720 blockards to a nakamode.
Then you only need roughly 151 nakamodes for one bitcoin. I think it will take some getting used to, but Americans might pick it quicker.
Loaf of bread? 60 blockards please.

Yeah I have, I was looking for an explain-to-me-like-I'm-on-r/bitcoin version because now that it's live, its not theory based on a dictionary definition. I just want to understand how it works in practice on ICE so that I'm not confusing it for how Google explains it for something that might differ slightly for something not cryptocurrency related.

How do BIPs get coordinated across the network? My understanding is that they are soft forks which means some people can participate if they choose, but theres no obligation for anyone using bitcoin to make a change. But I'm not 100% sure if that's right.
Is there a difference between BIPs and soft forks? Could someone use a bitcoin program that didn't use any BIPs but instead ran a wallet based off of the very first program released by satoshi and still be accepted by the network today?
@_date: 2019-09-23 13:47:27
My understanding is that the hardware wallet itself generates the seed, which it uses to derive public and private key pairs, and that it does this randomly and remotely only when you've got it in your hand and asking it to.
You could say that there is some trust that the algorithm used for generating the seed is completely random, and not something that the maker would have some round-about way of recovering back at the factory, but I'm fairly sure its all mostly open-source at this point - so in that case you're trusting that there are people in the community who would leave no stone un-turned when checking the code, and that someone would speak up if they found something. 
Always buy direct from the manufacturer, and check the security seals aren't tampered with upon arrival.

Perfect timing.

Is there currently (or could there ever be) a way of verifying transactions with 0 confirmations?
How hard would it really be for someone to double-spend if you only wait for, say, 1 confirmation as opposed to 2, or 6 as recommended? 
If LN doesn't broadcast to base layer each transaction in order to make it part of the blockchain, how do you know that what someone has sent you is really legitimate? If this can be done without a blockchain, then why wait for confirmations on the base layer anyway?
Thanks for any help!

Delivered in one month or less, or your fiat back guarantee!
@_date: 2019-09-30 13:19:05
Can you undo a transaction if it's still in the mempool?
Can miners pick and choose transactions to include? Or is it automatically the transactions with the highest fee?
Would a miner or groups of miners be able to blacklist addresses from sending coins?

You need no more, no less.

Stats like this really annoy me, is anyone really sitting there with their mouth watering over the idea of %15,000,000 increase? Percentage increases aren't useful when the starting number is practically ZERO.

So this is the price that you can pay to "buy" btc one month from now? Like you put your money in escrow or something and then in one month you get the btc and they get the fiat?
Just trying to make sure I've got my head around it.

What's the most exciting things going on in terms of development for Bitcoin, e.g. Lightning?
Any aspects of bitcoin (like privacy or speed of transactions) that new cryptographic solutions are being worked on which might see interesting improvements in the base or layer 2 solutions?

Ahh thank you, I didn't realise this was for institutions only. I thought p2p you could buy/sell these futures and wasn't sure how it was settled between individuals.

The majority of people won't have 0.005 BTC
If majority means more than half, you could only just divide 21 million coins into 3.5 billion to get over 0.005, but I'd wager we'd never see the supply evenly split across half the world like that. 
So there will likely never be a time where the majority of people have 0.005 BTC

Imagine you have some rare trading cards, but the school kids value them differently over time, 1 week they'll give you $20 next week $18, week after $25.
You know that once a month your dad comes back from a work trip and gives you some cards that he picked up that he knows you like.
You think the price might go down to $15 by the end of the month, but currently the kids are buying them off you for $20. Unfortunately, you've run out! 
So you make a deal with a kid, "when my dad brings me some cards, I'll sell them to you for $17 no matter what - pinky promise, cross my heart and hope to die stick a needle in my eye, swear on my mother's grave!"
The kid think hmmm, $17 cheaper than $20, and he knows sometimes they can go as high as $30! Deal he says!
When the day comes you have to sell the cards for $17 like you promised no matter what the other kids are asking for that day, one of you will be getting a good deal, the other not so much.
However it isn't necessarily a bad deal for one party, imagining for a moment the kid is an institution with a budget and shareholders perhaps - being able to lock in a garenteed price can add stability and gives certainty to what a future transaction is definitely going to be. This can help with budgets and ensure there are no nasty surprises. 
So even if the kid ends up buying the cards for $17 at the end of the month, when the other kids are only paying $14, the kid was able to budget and buy movie tickets at the start of the month because he knew for a fact what his budget was going to be, so he gaurteened himself tickets and cards - even though he's short $3.

This is some advice I received a while back which has helped me:
Aside from simply being happy with what you've got, which is obviously easier said than done and we are wired to pursue more, set a specific amount that you want based on how you'd live your ideal life.
What do you want to spend you're time doing on a Monday? Write down how you'd live if money wasn't a issue. Then what about the next day, then the next day. Once you have a week, is that how you'd live every week? What do you do the next week of the month? And so on. Once you have a month, how does that change from month to month throughout the year?
Write this all down for how you'd like to live a year out if money wasn't a limitation to you and then start questioning why. Why are these things important? Is it sentimental in some way? Is it more of just a status thing? Why is that important? Will the value of these things last a lifetime or do you know they will be fleeting? Is it mainly a comfort thing? There's no right or wrong answer, it's your list, just really put it on yourself to be honest about why you want to live this way. If the why isn't strong enough, you probably won't be satisfied when you get, and you probably won't have a strong enough drive to get it anyway.
Once that's all figured out and decided on, then you set dollar amounts to all these things. How much does it cost to live in this ideal world? What's the rent/mortgage like? If you're planning on buying outright, what's the price of that place? What will groceries costs for you to live ideally? The price of petrol? Will you be going on road trips? How much will it cost to service your car throughout the year? What will all your insurance payments cost? How much will you spend on clothing per year? On utilities? On medical expenses? What about the fun stuff like eating out, celebrating and games - how much per year on these things based on what you described earlier? How much to charity? Add a little extra for miscellaneous expenses like fines and accidents etc.
All of this is based on what you planned to live like, backed by a strong enough why for it and now supported with an actual dollar amount in the form of a budget and it should be down to the dollar. 
Store it in word or excel, and that's now your goal. Thats your "enough", because you wouldnt have a reason - a why - to aquire any more.
While I'm still in the process of reaching this goal myself, I've learnt this from a couple of men who applied it before they acquired their multi-millions, and they are very happy with the lives they live.
As a reference point, they said roughly $200k per year was the peak of their enjoyment, and obviously you're going to want that to be as much passive income as possible, while still working your job to the degree that you find satisfaction and fulfillment from contributing to society.
Obviously we want to live in a world with a bitcoin standard, but for the time being the game we play is done with fiat, so this exercise is best done in terms of fiat. Convert it into BTC equivalent when you're done if you'd like for a rough idea of what your accumulating to.
You may be a long way off from your goal, but at least you'll know what enough is, and be able to articulate it if anyone asks, so you don't seem like a Walter White just wanting "more".

Potentially slightly, yes. The difficulty to mine each block adjusts roughly every 2 weeks so that it would take roughly 10 minutes for each block to be found with the current hashrate. So with an escalating hashrate, this means that blocks will on average be found faster until the next adjustment, but not by much. It will still likely be in May.
Since the hashrate overall has been increasing since inception, this is why the actual average block mined is actually less than 10 minutes. But theoretically it could go the other way too.
