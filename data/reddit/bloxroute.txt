LN is advertised as a scalability solution, i.e., something which will allow Bitcoin to support high volumes of TPS.
Regardless of what you want to use it for, it appears to be flawed flawed.
Could you specify a use case which is important and significant in which LN scales Bitcoin, and these flaws are not a showstopper?

I want to use it for regular transacting, like buying coffee.
You say that I’m trying to use LN for something Bitcoin is already good for, but Bitcoin processes 3.3 TPS, while just Starbucks needs ~400 TPS.
So we cannot all use Bitcoin, because there’s no room for all of us, so I question the use of LN,  but this solution appears flawed for coffee etc. since it requires me to be always online, or use a 3rd party service, in which case I can save myself the trouble and continue using my bank...

But... even if you are an online casino, you need the users to have lightning nodes, and why would they do that? They are not online casinos... So even this use case doesn’t seem to make sense?
And why would an online casino prefer LN, which requires 3rd parties? What value is he getting?
So here’s where it’s not useful: for regular people transacting. That’s ~5000 TPS today (all credit\debit cards combined).
When does it make sense?

What? I don’t understand your argument...
If you want to keep LN decentralized, you need people to route money through their channels. For that, they need to be always online.
Also, Bitcoin supports 3.3 TPS, while credit cards are doing 5000 TPS today, so the “this is something you could do with Bitcoin” is not a valid argument.

What about all those who are not an online casino?

Hold on...
First, what’s your end game? Do you want everyone to be a part of LN, participating in the routing, or you are aiming at hub-n-spoke?
Because if it’s the former than I disagree.
Now, if I have an open channel with you, and you payed me some amount, I’m now constantly worried that you will submit the previous state to the blockchain and undo the transaction that payed me money.
So I need to be online to prevent it or use a 3rd party.

I disagree with you regarding the scalability, on where the bottleneck lies, and whether it’s solvable.
But - let’s put this aside for the time being.
My argument is that LN is flawed, since it forfeits the most important properties of Bitcoin- direct P2P transaction without trusting a 3rd party. If you forfeit that, why not just use a bank?

Hi - I didn’t find the time to continue the discussion until now...
I did understand stand your spoon vs knife argument, but why do you think people will use the spoon (LN) at all?
The knife (Bitcoin) made sense if you wanted easy-to-use money, w/o placing trust in 3rd parties. LN doesn’t offer this, so why would someone choose it over banks? Because it scales and Bitcoin allegedly doesn’t? Who cares - banks scale as well...
So I pointed out LN is flawed in the context that it doesn’t give you the guarantees of Bitcoin, and I cannot see why anyone would like to use it.
Telling me they are different doesn’t answer my objection.

Yep... that’s how the system is designed. People open state channels among themselves, and the LN part is how A routes a payment to D thru B and C.
I don’t understand why people are so excited about it...
You can either be always online, or trust a 3rd party to be online for you. But then, what’s the point of using a blockchain? Just trust the bank to hold your funds (which will be a lot more efficient using a single server)
And there’s also the issue that your money is always in a channel with an online node, so you can’t have a cold wallet. Your money is always being used to route payments, so your node is always signing LN transactions, which means it’s always a hot wallet.
This is a side note, but it’s quite substantial in terms of security.

That doesn’t really answer my remarks, does it?
I argue it is inherently flawed, and you say it has its limits.
From where I’m standing, no progress had been made if the solution being worked on is flawed, so no limits have been moved, and my remarks haven’t been answered yet.
@_date: 2018-08-08 04:06:10
What you’re saying is that LN is just for very specific use cases, and it is flawed as a solution for majority of the use cases?
Because that’s kind of my argument...
@_date: 2018-08-08 05:10:49
You are missing my point.
We both need to be simultaneously online to make a payment in LN.
In Bitcoin, you can send money that I someone even if he’s offline.
