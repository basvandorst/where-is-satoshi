What about cnbc spreading fud. That writer should be fired!

I see one on ebay for 21k right now. At the peak of hype I saw them going for 100k.
Hard to say if the one on ebay right now is real.

How much energy is used to secure our traditional finance system? 
Mine gold?
Mine silver?
Print and mint fiat?
Buildings to house banks?
And on top of that they still run servers/clients 24 hours a day.
If anything this processs is much more efficient.

Ruined a collectors item worth far more than face value of bitcoin.

You asked me what I meant when I criticized this article for not providing a complete picture and I replied.
I clearly know the difference between a bill and a law, but unfortunately as the market has shown a lot of people don’t and panic sold due this fud piece.
Are you some type of paid shill for cnbc? You seem to haven taken to their defense on a professional level ��

If someone is spending money telling you not to buy, you should probably buy.

How about adding information on how the Korean government works?
Like what does it take to get a bill passed? 
When will the bill be ready?
When will the bill be voted on?
Who votes on the bill and how much support it needs to pass?
How about who has shown support for such a ban?
Share who is opposed to a ban?
Provide some facts as to what basis crypto can be banned in a country run by due process and law.
Maybe if they reported these facts, people would see the laws of Korea aren't decided by one man, and that the Korean Government isn't united in banning crypto.

I mine in one of the most expensive states for electricity and make atleast 100% profit daily.  Where are you getting your figures from you sound so sure of yourself but cant be more wrong.

This guy gives horrible advice. According to his views we should be knee deep into the apocalypse already.
He’s sad cuz bitcoin mooned but gold didn’t.
@_date: 2019-07-17 23:47:11
Reading his doom and gloom books and following his advice loses a lot of money ��

How about providing a complete picture? And thinking about the consequences of what they write?
Yesterday news shows korea planning to ban crypto trading.
Today, oh wait no they’re not.
End result I get to buy cheap coins.
Thanks news!

Asking price didnt pay close enough attention to see if they completed the sale.

This guys been singing gloom and doom for more than 10 years. Someday he’ll get it right.

Boo hoo someone didn’t buy any crypto ��

Years back he said he didnt understand apple and said it would have a hard time continually innovating... now apple is his biggest investment and he wished he could own all of it.

There’s a project working to do something similar called obsidian. Its a private message system and cryptocurrency that works on proof of stake.

BTC went from 3k to 8k in a matter of a month, its not going to go up non stop. Just like how alt coins wont keep going down.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:45:55
Don’t worry we’ll still buy it

It would be an embarassment, anti freedom, anti freemarket. We'd be no better than a totalitarian 1984 style society.

Without crypto might as well run a sql database.

+1 on this i got china fudded and cant jump back in. This is after doing good trades of buying low and selling high. Hard to get right and once you make a bad trade you can get whipsawed into doing mutliple bad trades.

The last batch of bitmain s9s can only be bought with BCH, it speaks to the level of confidence Jihan has in the project. Intense drama if bch turns out to be the right contrarian trade.

Seems like a good way to lose money if you can’t convert your crypto into fiat immediately. Here in the US if you’re not trading in btc, ltc or ether its hard to go back to cash. You’d need to switch to another fiat ramp and incur more fees. Do they have fiat ramps in Asia for bch? This leads me to believe he’s going out of his way to get bch, since the price has been dropping, I wonder what’s his rationale that the public seems to not understand.

People are tripping of themselves to buy his machines, on amazon unauthorized resellers mark up his gear x3 and buyers still line up.  Doubt he is desperate.
