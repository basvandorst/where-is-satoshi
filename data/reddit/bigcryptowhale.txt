No reason to buy coffee, but makes lots of more reasons if you are planning to travel with a Samsonite suite-case full of cash.
Or when you find yourself out of money (cash/change) in a remote place in Thailand, and the only thing you have is a brainwallet, a phone and Localbitcoins.
Both stories are true in my case.

Depends who is asking.
Some people think a first class seat is overpriced as well.
Want to get a few millions to the other side of the world without suit-cases? $1200 is nothing compared to other options.
Not supporting the high fees, just saying.
For economy class there is a bunch of other altcoins.

This is why many of us who have more than 100 still keeping our jobs.
At least can speak for myself.
There are many more opportunities in crypto, so just read, study and make your choice for the next shuttle to the moon.

How brainwashed you need to be in order to compare a transaction of less than a kB to shipping gold around the world? Speaking as a long time hodler of many hundreds of BTC core.

mix with other coins on various exchanges over a period of a month

Except the fact that you have to pay $20 when you want to give
$50-100 worth of BTC to your friends, and hope it will arrive before new year's eve, it's all perfect.

And if you had 20 bitcoin in college, you wouldn't have to go there ever.
This coulda shoulda woulda trash from people who missed the train is kind of annoying.

For a day-to-day there is a new "altcoin" that is not allowed to discuss here, for some reason. This is a temporary,  although not a long term and not a scalable solution, for using the good ol' Bitcoin protocol and consensus for micro transactions.

Don't thank BTC, it's just a concept/technology.
Thank yourself for the patience and gambling skills.
When you need to hold - hold,  just like in the casino.
And don't blame BTC when you lose, same goes in
the opposite way.

Now think how it makes -you- a "bigger" core supporter before you call me a troll.

Reddit is not for controversial discussions, that's what Google and Twitter are for. Search for the right info, post your own thoughts, respectively.
Most of the posts here are not informative in any helpful way.

Not -so- rude since most people still consider it as as something virtual. When people ask me that question IRL I was surprised before, but after a few questions it seems that most of them think about it the same way as "How many Apple products you have". That's how nocoiners think about it. I am not sure why regular holders should be concerned by that question, this is pretty much asking as how many valuable stuff you got because you believe in their value. Of course if you hodl over 10BTC you have to be very careful about whom you provide this info to IRL.

For me it's the same thing that makes people buy gold/diamonds.
I don't understand why they need it, but I like the idea that I got it cheap and now some analysts with a $2000 suit can promote this to the regular Joe that wants to invest his yearly payroll in a high yield scheme with obvious risks.
Are we still on the same page? Since if we are, I don't see any issue for a $20, even $50 transaction fee for this operation.

What's a 20mil for a $300bn market cap and $15bn volume?
Many of us here (although not many would admit) hodl a substantial amount of BTC, which can sum to 1000-2000 coins on average.
If ever anyone wants to cash out, the markets should dip? That would be a very alarming sign.

Just like gift cards from your favorite retailer.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:39:38
Just ask a relative/friend.
Kind of shady to pay anyone to do that for you.

Pay for an onboard Wifi or a SAT phone.
