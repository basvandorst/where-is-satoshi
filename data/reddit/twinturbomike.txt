Definitely the result of the recent TV episode of "The Good Wife - Bitcoin for Dummies"

12.1 is ok as long as you don't have more than 4 GPUs in your board at once, and you do not upgrade the SDK to 2.6.
My 5 series cards run great with SDK version 2.1 and 12.1 drivers. 6 series requires at least SDK 2.4 from what I understand.

I don't doubt the security to the outside world. I worry about what happens when someone from the inside compromises the devices via software revisions. Hardware is a bit of a black box and not as easy to evaluate as open source software.

Their CTO says it is possible to transmit the private keys out of the device if the client is coded to do so.

Right now two things stop businesses from accepting bitcoins: Volatility and illiquidity.
I don't think it would be too complicated for them to sell bitcoins locally. The only element being added here is that a merchant would publicize their willingness to sell the bitcoins which their customers come in and spend at their establishment. Then they don't have to set up an account on Dwolla, MtGox, and wait for days for transactions to clear, hoping the price doesn't tank in the interim. There really isn't a way around this until all other businesses that merchant does business with provides their needed goods and services for bitcoins as well.  It's actually a bit of a chicken and egg problem. Nobody wants to go first. I see the local selling-off of bitcoins acquired as an interim solution until that point is reached. Selling bitcoins to local patrons is no harder than selling a cheeseburger or whatever else the customer walks through their door to buy.

Just wait until the early bitcoin adopters start pulling out their wallets to lobby in favor of bitcoin. If the price keeps climbing like it has been, it won't take too long for favorable legislation to occur.

I had random letters, numbers and a word. Honestly I suppose it could have been made more difficult, but I rarely use MtGox and don't keep large funds in there. Needless to say, I enabled two factor auth now.

I got hit by this as well. Luckily I only had like .3 btc in my account. I didn't have two factor auth enabled as I rarely used MtGox anyway. Yep, I fell for it. That's a first in my 20 years of being online. We all make mistakes and I could have avoided this one had it not been late at night and nearly falling asleep.

I revised my post. Turns out it was a phishing ad on facebook of all things. I remember clicking that link in hindsight. I should have known better and I've never been tripped up by these historically as I am usually pretty careful.
Moral of the story, don't log into important financial and sensitive websites late at night when you're tired and not focused. :p

A young man tells his father he wants to raise a Butterfly farm after seeing a picture of a Monarch. There's a moment of silence as his father looks at him incredulously then exclaims, "You're Joshing me right?"

Two miners jump into a public pool after much difficulty mining solo all day. One says to the other, "I think it's time to get out. That kid who always PPs in the pool is back again."

It would be nice if Gyft could implement some major grocery stores, and perhaps gas stations.

Looks like these bullsh** ads are still rolling. I just saw one again on my sidebar.

Ridiculous. I'll never own an iPhone for this and similar reasons.

Would this mean the coins that the feds seized from shutting down SR could be invalidated? If/when those get thrown up on the open exchanges, price is going to tank due to the excess supply.

Earlier today I just offered up $50 in free bitcoins to the first 10 responders. I just provided links to blockchain.info and sent each person $5 for signing up. Although I do like OP's thinking. Whatever the implementation, it needs to be easy and needs to be repeatable by grandma and little brother alike to go viral.
