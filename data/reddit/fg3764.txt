Too much work today. I'll calculate it tomorrow and post away.

Thanks. I'll look at them along with the other bitcoin solutions, and I'll calculate if it works out better than the banks.

Yes, it looks like some people use it for getting BTC for illicit activities. Thanks for the tip.

Thanks man. Unfortunately I'm in the UK, so I can't meet you. Good tip with Kraken though!

Thanks. I started to suspect this, eyeing the rates on ANXPRO. I'll calculate this scenario.

By the way, I came across Revolut.com, which supports 90 currencies, but it exchanges _from_ only EUR, GBP or USD. If that's what you want to exchange from, it's a great service.

Thanks, I'll look at Bitfinex and the other bitcoin based solutions, and I'll see if it works out any better than the banks.

I must have overseen that. I'll check them out tomorrow. Thanks for the tip!

Yes, I compiled and went through an exhausting list of those services. None of them supports HKD to GBP. The closest I got was I added my email as interested in future support of HKD to GBP on 
@_date: 2016-03-30 23:14:55
I looked at them before, and they support only EUR, not GBP.

I want the cheapest and easiest way - no ideological reasons. I welcome any tips. :)

Thanks, I'll look into this.
Out of curiosity, why do people use localbitcoins when they can get better rates on exchanges?
