This is one of those aphorisms that has the opposite of its desired effect. Like when someone says "If you can't handle me at my best, you don't deserve me at my worst," they've just signaled what an insufferable person they are.
This "first they laugh at you" quote is something you frequently hear from people who deserve to be laughed at, like furries.

He has spammed this dozens of times on Reddit now. It's getting embarrassing.
Does this guy actually work for CNBC? This is a bad look for them.

Maybe controversial on a bitcoin sub, but I'm with you. It's always embarrassing to see children used as props. Kind of creepy, in fact.

I just unsubbed because of these shitposts. I can't escape them!

What if I told you there are many popular crypto gambling sites, and there have been from the very beginning?
@_date: 2018-05-13 22:01:06
Please be joking.

If you're going to make fun of her for being dumb, don't lack the knowledge of how to spell "perish"! ;)

I think you might have missed the point of this comic, which is that you can plug in any new technology and it will likely be relevant.

If your casual bitcoin suddenly becomes 90% of your networth, you can simply sell until it's a manageable chunk of your networth. Opting not to is a choice, and is effectively the same thing as pouring your life savings into Bitcoin.

Yeah, figures. Looks like there's a new-ish default effect called CC Particle System II, which I've never used, so not sure if that would work either.
I'm certain it can be easily done in Particular, though. I've made lots of stuff like that before.
@_date: 2018-03-23 05:57:20
I don't understand these panicky anecdotes about getting so scared over the day-to-day price swings. Are you putting your life savings into this? Is that the mistake you're warning us not to make?
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:04:54
Not sure why you're lecturing me about this. I'm not a churner, and never said it was a smart thing to do. Was just pointing out how it works because the person I replied to seemed to be under the impression that it had something to do with speculating on the market.
Unless he meant that they were lucky not to lose their accounts.
EDIT: I guess it was incorrect of me to say "no risk at all", but I was really referring to BTC price.

A simple way to do it would be in After Effects with a particle simulator like Trapcode Particular. Just set the floor, tweak gravity, keyframe the rate so you have a set number of particles (instead of the generator spitting them out), and use a custom image (Bitcoin logo) for your particles.
You might even be able to do it with CC Particle World (comes stock with After Effects), though it's been years since I used that so I'm not certain.

If you're washing it fast enough, there's no risk at all and no luck required. It's just free money in the form of miles/rewards/points. It's called churning, there are many forums and a popular subreddit dedicated to it.

Is that what he's best known for? I only know him as Darryl from The Office.

At first I thought you were the [shitty YouTuber]( who goes by the same name.
Maybe give Google a spin when choosing brand names lol

Grandpa, that's not how this meme works. Both characters are supposed to be hyperarticulate.

Veering off-topic here, but I was talking to a friend the other day about how I'm suspicious of people who are way too nice. I'm sure some people genuinely are. But many seem to simply hide what they're really thinking, like you just said. That's calculated, deceptive behavior! At least with assholes you know where you stand.
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:14:47
Gotcha. Makes sense.
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:07:25
Yes. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and assume you're somewhere in this solar system. 
If you're from one of them backwater systems, we don't like your kind around here.

Why are we supposed to give money to someone calling himself "Money Trigz" using an actor's picture?
Come on. If you want to do this, do it above board.
@_date: 2018-04-12 00:55:19
Did you just assume [my canonical reality?](
@_date: 2018-04-23 16:38:37
That's fair enough, but it's ironic to see from a subreddit that claims to be a bastion of free speech.
@_date: 2018-04-26 15:48:34
Do you mean a PBN? Didn't those become defunct 5 years ago?
