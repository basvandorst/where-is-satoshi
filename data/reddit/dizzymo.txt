And even so, a lot of countries are happy to accept a US dollar. Try giving them any other currency other than their own, they probably won't want it. Euro maybe.

Same troll factory that helped Trump is helping pump bcash and other crypto currencies, they are trying to divide and conquer over Bitcoin

You could get someone to back up the bitcoins and promise that they are legit, perhaps just on some sort of Bitcoin minted paper. Maybe like the local government or something could offer that guarantee. And once power comes back on, trade back those pieces of paper. It's a crazy idea but it might just work.

Look at Puerto Rico. Disaster zone. ATMs are down. Power is out. Everyone is trading bitcoins.
