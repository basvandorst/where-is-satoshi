you're retarded with those items.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:45:23


what fucking bullshit are you on about ?
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:00:32
Hi. It's me, your brother and uncle and sister. 12jmoyndQWEq2U9PNq6eYmrQw1wzJKJPBQ 
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:14:48
who gives a fuck as to why...his point is proven correct..all 3 blacklisted him on the same day so there was collusion aka corruption.
@_date: 2018-09-22 08:38:09
Oh really..cause someone bashing him in some comments above was adamant that there's no link between govs and financial institutions banning people from using the banking services.
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:21:10
Bullshit...got sources for him inciting people to do that ? 
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:02:32
For what reason they don't want him when they're a commission based business ? Answer this.
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:03:26
Not this bullshit about families cryfest.
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:11:52
He has the right to not be discriminated...you can't kick him out, but keep others, from your shop just cause his name is alex jones just when he's standing there not doing or saying anything but just cause you feel you don't like something he said 4 years ago.
@_date: 2018-09-23 21:20:55
Don't know..we have no google here.
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:10:37
it's not limited to that..dear god i hope you haven't spent a fortune on university to still be this naive...discrimination can be suffered by anyone..is there something in the drinking water in your jungle camp ?
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:17:57
It's full of retards in here...it's not only censorship but also discrimination.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:32:35
what does one gain from being an adopter ? the cpu mining ship has sailed. now it's rich kids playing with other rich kids. bitcoin might as well not exist for me.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:11:51
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:06:13
Then paypal can go fuck themselves and get investigated and fined for discrimination...how does your libtard assface like that ? 
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:20:27
Stop being stupid...life's easier like that.
@_date: 2018-09-22 07:55:48
Except this is political and not financial motivated. Nice try.
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:22:06
yeah well when you're in a concentration camp cause your credit score is too low, we'll all laugh and laugh...
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:16:20
Oh so now it's cool..just the other comment you were laughing at the notion of chemicals making frogs gay and now you say ''oh so it's true,chemicals can make frogs gay cause Berkeley University said so, but still so what''....you've got very loose morals, haven't you ?
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:04:21
Fuck that..how about you answer his question about the wmd that lead to multiple wars.
@_date: 2018-09-23 21:19:55
They can take action but it has to be the same action for everyone otherwise it's discrimination.
@_date: 2018-09-22 07:55:19
Federal and state laws prohibit discrimination in employment.....the whole list. BUT it doesn't say ''only in'' those things. And in fact he's covered by the ''use of facilities'' based ''on creed''...they banned him cause they don't like what he believe in...aka his theories. So why don't you buy a brain and get to me, ok darling ? 
@_date: 2018-09-22 07:52:58
You got proof of that ?
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:05:22
Oh man stfu with your shit propaganda...you're acting really really dumb if you're pretending that the media doesn't control the narrative.
@_date: 2018-05-16 08:29:45
So... Let me know when it hits 2 cents again so i can buy 50k bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-03-08 09:30:28
You don't know who had the capability and when... You didn't know anything about all of this until yesterday.
@_date: 2017-03-08 09:20:24
Are we ignoring the fact that now they managed to lose control of it all ? 
That now someone else, like a Nigerian fucking Prince, has all of those tools on a fucking stick? 
The nsa must be laughing their socks off saying to them "you wanted to play with us in the big league, and now you've screwed yourselves out of existence...such a shame for all that Columbian drug money you've stashed all over in barrels in the ground and will never get too use from your prison cells."
@_date: 2018-10-01 09:53:27
you could just tip the bottle for free.

what's a riff ? like a dis ?
@_date: 2017-01-02 21:21:51
Anyone here delivered that 10.000 btc pizza? Jesus... To have gotten 100 btc even 5 years ago...
@_date: 2017-01-22 19:34:58
None? People is poor...
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:06:40
Don't mind if you send a few bitcoins my way.
@_date: 2017-01-08 20:19:14
I doubt there are so many merchants in that country.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:30:01
Hey OP.... His the decentralised thingy working of now there's still someone chewing fees ? And there's no anonymity. Ever transaction can be traced. And if you're gonna say"week you go through an exchange".. Then any agency can ask and be given the logs.... So exactly how is this different from traditional banks ? Cause it's faster ? Big deal... There's still fees and worse anonymity. With a traditional bank there's no tracing shit by average Joe. Nevermind trusts and shit.
@_date: 2017-01-15 20:46:35
Come on people... Anyone? I would give if i had them.
@_date: 2017-01-02 21:27:06
Fuck milk... Got Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-01-15 08:33:26
Not begging... Asking nicely.
@_date: 2017-01-02 21:37:07
I know.... So can i have a few thousand bitcoins ? They're nothing but bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-01-15 08:34:06
Why do you care what i do?
@_date: 2017-01-15 08:34:21
@_date: 2017-01-02 21:25:18
That's not safe... You should move them somewhere else... Like my wallet ;)
@_date: 2017-01-08 20:03:01
Did you get in on the action right after the Genesis block ?
@_date: 2018-06-30 11:17:36
Will it reach single dollar ?
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:59:48
Just wondering if anyone is still alive or has everyone killed themselves over the prices ?
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:13:53
Buy more what ? :))) Seriously I think I'll wait for it so drop to like 2 dollars before i buy.
@_date: 2018-06-28 04:16:24
so you guys see no possible outcome where bitcoin crashes to a few cents and stay there forever ?
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:24:07
I mined 50000 bitcoin on my amd athlon xp lol...no i din't fuuuuuuuuuuck.
@_date: 2017-11-18 10:38:30
Sorry girl.. Us men don't do math... It's too girly.
@_date: 2017-04-13 08:00:34
The fuck is segawheat ?
@_date: 2019-01-21 21:17:32
bitcoin is a gov scam....it's going to replace cash and it's traceable while cash isn't. all the hype about decentralized and no fees turns out to be a lie. it's already very centralized into a few exchanges and fees are all over the place. remind me again what problems bitcoin solves ? 
@_date: 2019-01-22 06:41:38
Bitcoin is traceable cause all you spend anywhere is traceable back to any wallet....even if you use multiple wallets, once your identity is know at any point, all transaction back to any point in time and all purchases also, are linked to you. With cash i can buy a newspaper here today and some peanuts there tomorrow...nobody links one with the other..fuck advertising companies.
And so what that no gov can print their own..they can just shut it all down, make it illegal to use and hey presto the same effect as if they had mined all the bitcoins in 1 second. And it's quite centralized now cause only big farms can mine it, everyone else is crazy to waste money on electricity, so it's centralized in big farms, and also govs could set up super farms given their super computers and laws they could make.
@_date: 2019-01-22 06:39:56
Solve problems ? How ? 
@_date: 2019-01-29 21:38:13
Yeah right.
@_date: 2019-01-29 21:39:43
decentralized my ass. all bitcoins go through the blockchain so not decentralized and to even use it you have to downlod how many GB ? it's all a gov project to replace cash. you gullible idiots are useful idiots.
@_date: 2019-01-29 21:37:45
Bullshit. you're not holding cause of moral reasons, and its already all pointing to bitcoin being a scam created by a gov.. this will die out and it's not even helping with decentralisation or anything....it's only purpose was to replace cash so the gov can tax it all multiple times.
@_date: 2019-01-30 03:03:05
@_date: 2018-03-01 03:09:44
What's a naaaano ?
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:04:30
Wall Street bets is leaking again.
@_date: 2017-09-26 15:50:03
It can also happen if people migrate towards it and away from fiat. No gov can force one to use fiat.
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:22:47
Hey if i had teens of thousands of bitcoins I'd be helping people left right and centre cause i like helping.
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:32:27
How many eggzactly ?
@_date: 2017-10-17 07:21:13
Oh look at me..
@_date: 2017-09-28 08:58:35
Well private people paying taxes on property isn't much part of the economy... The vast majority is from business.
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:59:09
What if bitcoin was , magically over night, the only currency... Would that mean it would have the value of all the first in the world ? Trillions divided by bitcoins mined so far ?
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:38:53
So much for bitcoin being decentralised or anonymous.
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:32:17
"Of what it could be " Like what ? Say if 1 billion people were to use bitcoin ? Would 1 bitcoin be 1 million instead of 5000 ?
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:59:11
So it's basically the same shit over. Fees to minr, fes to transfer, fees to store. Fuck this shit.
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:49:48
Anyone got hundreds of thousands of bitcoins ? What would it cost you to send me a few thousands ? You wouldn't even notice.
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:23:14
What about this fork ? What happens to bitcoin ? Will there be bitvoin 1 and bitcoin2 with same values or what ? How will the 2 be mined sorely separately ? Or what's the actual difference between them then ?
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:55:37
Who ?
@_date: 2018-07-12 05:58:57
Blacks are broke... Can't afford face.
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:15:55
what about 1-2-3-4-5 years from now ?
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:15:03
someone said bitcoin could reach 1 mil..isn't that just crazy ?
@_date: 2017-07-07 13:11:17
Cops stole btc ? What????
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:18:53


well not beat, but go to 1000 bucks etc.
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:28:48
1 mil ? i don't know..that's like insane, lots of billionaires from bitcoins, can the economy absorb them ?
@_date: 2017-07-17 07:55:46
Thanks... Is it worth a donation ? ;)
@_date: 2017-07-08 01:37:54
Shame... Waste of good bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:18:05
6800-8000 dollars for one miner generating 230 dollars per month... That's 30 to 33 months to recover. How many times does bitcoin increase difficulty and halv the reward ? Totally bad plan. On grid is so much better it's not even funny.
@_date: 2017-06-08 02:02:28
No worries OP just send them this way 
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:50:23
There goes "decentralisation". Would switch to PoW fix it?  What kind of hashrates would we have with gpu after such a switch ? 1 top gpu equal to one of today's asic ?
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:49:23
So everyone will have solar powered backpacks with laptops and wifi for bitcoin payments ? This is worth something right ? 12jmoyndQWEq2U9PNq6eYmrQw1wzJKJPBQ
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:51:32
I'm curious. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:44:40
Article doesn't say what kind of miners they use. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:40:40
An asset ? 
Well i don't know about how it all started but imagine someone running their pc for a few hours,  a few 1000 coins, then forgetting about them until recently.  Omg...or tens of thousands. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 16:54:24
Is it gonna reach 1 mil ? Also isn't it starting to look affective to mine with gpu/asic again ?
@_date: 2017-06-19 08:34:45
Like how?  There's no 50 gpu diy frame bolted to the case.
@_date: 2017-06-09 23:47:58
Right...just saying...if ones has 1000000 bitcoins ;)
@_date: 2017-06-10 03:13:17
How did they steal it from him?  Did they find out his private key or what ? And i thought is was 600000 bitcoins so about 1.7 billion. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:02:29
Lol...i wonder what people think about after mining 10000s with a cpu in the beginning. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 20:29:30
I'm just thinking how anyone that would have minded even a single day back then with a laptop would have been set for life. 100 coins i could have built myself a house, had a family,  all they need, car, live my life...1000 coins wow that's just more than anyone can ever spend.  And to think that a third of coins will never be spent cause they've forgotten about of they keys lost. Well that's that. I guess good things don't happen to normal people.
