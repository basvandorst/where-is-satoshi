THE QR is not to download the app just to be clear its to register/login so open the app and scan the qr code

They want you to start using the app version. They are probably still testing the app so it may not work on all phones. That's why they they ask you to get the app to get as much feedback and data as possible. I'm a developer and this is something I would do

Please before you comment no i do not work for them. I didn't get paid to say this i just happen to follow them when they announce the first contest. I posted this because of the bitcoin part

Hey bro how old are you? 50 ? Do you know how instagram works? you click on a hashtag and you get every single picture that's using that hashtag. 
 Plus i posted it here because i wanted to share it with the community. Bitcoin is very new to regular people and the fact that some companies are starting to mention bitcoin is great for bitcoin. If this was zynga with the app i would still title it like this.

I was on instagram and click a bitcoin hashtag and saw it plus the contest rules on there app says so

for anyone just saying this is a scam. i wanted to let you know that if you read the app rules "inside" the game you'll know that you have the option to chose the prize money. either paypal , check or bitcoin. i wanted to share this because i believe in bitcoin and love it when people mention bitcoins in the products they make.
