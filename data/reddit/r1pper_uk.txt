so much Fud from the UK broadsheets definitely working in collusion with the banks to devalue Bitcoin.

Hopefully we should see a Bull run start tomorrow as the weekly limits on coinbase reset from thanksgiving. Also the next push will probably go 23-24K then a huge drop. So Id would buy NOW and sell monday. This is just my gut but trend based gut reaction. Although the whole Bcash thing throws a massive spanner in the works.

ive been into Bitcoin for 2-3 months and had 2-3 scares in that time. Im much more relaxed now as ive only got 2-3K invested. although this is bigger than the other times I think the reversal should be immanent and we should ride back up to 20k-24k. More small holding more panic when Bcash tries something....falls get bigger but then we build again. trick is to not sell and HODL. This is easier if you only invest what you are happy to lose.
There are also a lot of people paid to spin negative threads or positive threads on this Sub read between the lines and don't believe half of it.

This is basically western propaganda are the press trying to soften us up for war??? I don't believe a single one of these articles but the worrying thing is 95% will. sounds a lot like Bcash.

but this is the one that goes to Zero!!!!

5.2K is probably a good entry point.

Price collapse lol. Zoom out!

Looks like its FOMO week on r/bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-28 13:52:50
probably a good call! im thinking about jumping in at these prices.

EVERYONE is being paid to FUD crypto. The board is ridiculously manipulated.
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:20:30
feels like well get a bounce back to 12-14 but cant see it getting up past 16k anytime in the next year as soooooo many bought in at 16-20k and just want their money back.
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:58:56
probably back down to 6.5K!
@_date: 2018-04-21 08:17:41
yeah, but the FUD has been strong the last 3 months. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 12:45:11
Can we dip back to 7k so can buy back in please.
@_date: 2019-05-16 09:00:04
Its kind of tickling 8K, not crushing it!
