Stable value. Bitcoin jumped two generations ahead, by being an electronic payment medium and its' own currency as well. By meeting only one of the two goals, MintChip has the stability of a nationally back currency and the convenience of electronic payment without card  fees. Evolution, not revolution, is often the one to bet on.

I don't see it having global appeal, no. However, adoption of a virtual currency will be fostered by this model. Bitcoin is just too far off the reservation for most people.

It's more of a perceived stability issue and familiarity with the currency system. Bitcoin's volatility is both understandable from the size of the market yet equally damning to the casual user.
I appreciate Bitcoin as a project, but MintChip is the step up from credit cards as the defacto electronic payment medium. 
Society moves in small steps. In the mid 90's people were talking about the death of the telcos, and in early 2000's about the death of cable TV. Just now we are starting to see the results, both roughly 15 years after their announcement.
A national electronic currency is an important step in the right direction. Not a destination, but a step.

Anything with a central issuing authority will have an inherent edge in today's centralized economy, no matter how unstable the central authority. MintChip is not a competing currency, it's really more of a Canadian Dwolla.

I think the real danger is that a million geeks hate the bad light that you shine on bitcoin and take it upon themselves to watch the blockchain or whatever tracking methods there are to report you every time you spend a Satoshi.

Amazon is older than SSL, I can remember seeing it in '94 or so back when the background was Netscape gray and the credit card numbers you sent were plaintext.
Tech will grow to meet a need.

Of course! And thanks for keeping the (unsustainable) dream alive!
For reference, I got .25 bitcoins per level one downline added, and it pays to level 3. Not sure on downline pay levels yet

and the storing nuts thing is a great metaphor for the hoarding problem we have.

I am not understanding what value the eBay $1 transaction ads. It's just a forum to give a thumbs up/air grievances, or is it an escrow service?

Hmm, an iPad (original) could have cell internet but no camera. Might look suspicious in light of iPad2 having cameras though.
Might be able to do both ends of the transaction via one machine? IE hand the iPad back and forth.
