Segwit adoption will happen and so will LN.

No one can answer that. What do you think? If yes - buy. if not wait for better opportunity or something else to invest.

If you own btc or anything else, just stay calm. I've been through roller-coaster rides like this more than I can remember. Until the math behind btc is broken - there is nothing to worry.

Yes. Looking so much forward to the 9k memes

I have made and lost btc on supporting/investing in altcoins. I have had losses (VTC, QRK) but also fantastic gains (NXT). Presently I'm very excited about NEM. Fantastic community and devs. Although I am stakeholder, I'm also buying more NEM through NXT Asset Exchange. Very exciting new platforms/technologies and people!

I think it was in some series like NCIS
@_date: 2014-06-13 12:10:04
What do you have against pure PoS coins like NXT? 
@_date: 2014-08-02 14:15:39
Neat feature in keepass against key logging : 
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:58:22
It would be interesting to see some 2.0 cryptos there also like NXT
@_date: 2018-10-18 02:01:31
Way better than mass media like CNN or cnbc

Like gold you mean? 
@_date: 2019-04-05 08:51:20
Dear StoicTyrant,
Why would I want BTC to be just a digital store of value?
I was trying to shine a little bit of light to OPs statement that BTC is ONLY USEFUL IF IT IS USED. No, it is not. It can be valuable even if it is only used as store of value - like gold (which I don't like).
Many people keep at least some small amount of gold. Way more than they hold BTC. i think they are wrong and should at least match that value with BTC if not replace it with BTC.
You've misread my poke at OP's statement.
Edit: Sorry, haven't realized that you are OP. :-)
To clarify further. There a lots of thing of value in the world although those things are seldomly used.
Rare and expensive cars that sit in garages
Gold bars (you even have to pay for storage and safekeeping)
Patents that are bought and kept safe so no one will use them.
Almost every collection some collector collects is valuable because of its rarity and not because of it's usefulness.
Once the Avengers get hold of the gauntlet will it stop to be valuable although they will probably decide to never USE it? :-)
@_date: 2019-04-05 08:44:25
Dear Internet person, let me help you get this straight.  Relax. 
OP in this thread said:  Its only useful (and therefore valuable) if it is being used. 
My point is that Bitcoin can be valuable if it is just as gold - people buy and hold. But as many people here know cryptos are far far more potentially useful than gold because they have so many different properties that gold cannot even imagine. But still, the gold is useful and valuable. I hate gold for numerous reasons. But saying that BTC needs to be used to have value is absurd. Using BTC will definitely help the price and it would be/will be great when it shakes the status quo that we now have in monetary world.
Thank you for your concern with my investments.

They want new SW so that they can bruteforce the password... 
@_date: 2019-01-30 06:40:08
Because if you would like investors to come to you you need a custodian (3rd party, not you). 
@_date: 2018-11-16 15:22:12
Nope. When economy collapsed in Greece did they start to use gold? 
@_date: 2019-01-30 06:42:06
Yea, but those big, institutional clients will be buying btc from the same circulating mass of btc which should drive the price up.

Great interview and very useful questions and excellent answers. Great job!

Use this opportunity to in their minds you get rid of crypto. So when it 10x from here, you are not in the spotlight as a rich person. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:19:49
I read that Nextcoin (nxt)  is also implementing that.

Diversify. Save a little in $,  a little in btc and a little in altcoins.  My altcoin of choice is Quark. My ratio is btc:qrk = 5:1
@_date: 2013-12-14 03:33:34
Mine both.  Quarks with cpu and litecoin with gpu :) 
@_date: 2013-12-24 07:14:41
NXT maybe?
