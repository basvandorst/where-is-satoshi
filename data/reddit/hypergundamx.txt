Same thoughts. Bitcoin has a lot more potential.

 None of those are legally binding statements.

 Crypto and useful technology don't belong together. But that's neither here nor there.

On point!

Hopefully not crucial, but obvious. A warning when estimated fees are above a set threshold.
Question: is it envisioned that ln becomes so large that there will always be a relatively cheap path to be found?
Also: is it named Lightning after the speed, or the way it finds a path, or both?

you are missing the big picture here. whales buy from OTC market at lower than market rate, they then short it on CBOE/CME/etc, after that they dump the BTC they have bought even at minors losses at times thus gaining from the futures contract and lowering BTC price in the regular market and making it even cheaper on the OTC markets.

There is only one thing crypto related that actually rustles my jimmies — when people refer to blockchains using the singular “blockchain” i.e. “we think that blockchain has the ability to ...” That rustles me up real good

Well, it's about to get bottom. Right now it's below 3k.

 CZ is free to delist anything he wants on his exchange.. Should the government(s) stop him? If so, which one(s)?

that's very possible but hoping won't happen.

no. we'll go down again from here or 6k. I don't agree with Tone Vays that we go as low as 1.8k but I think shitcoins will be crushed and lose another 80-90% from here. When the bullrun starts Bitcoin will have &gt;60% market dominance.
just a guess. no advice. I have no fucking idea.

That's true! And also, If you have a small amount of Bitcoins lying around, it won’t be of much use to convert them to traditional currency. Instead, you can try your luck at an online casino and then, if you earn more you can convert them and spend them as you please. Depositing cryptocurrency to an online casino account involves a lot smaller fees compared to deposits using traditional currencies via standard payment methods. Some operators even allow feeless transactions;
Cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals are instant, compared to other transactions, especially withdrawals, which may take up to several days or even more. Casinos that accept Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies often offer far more lucrative bonuses and promotions compared to regular online casinos.

Agreed! This site has the best graphics! I also love playing Balls, it is one of their unique games. You have 11 balls and as many as eight chances at guessing which ball is the winner. If you choose just 1 ball and get it right, the payout is 10.89 times your wager. Everyone loves the dice games, and Luckygames.io players are no different. Theirs is a customary over-under try, with 99x being the possible take. It is the most popular place to be.
