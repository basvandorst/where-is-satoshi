Thank you!

I agree, I did not think about this...

Having a good relationship with the manager and owner does not not imply any elite status within the business. This is my part time job, I already have a career, this is something I do after to make some more money.
I did not really think about what happens if a client base is built around BTC and I am not there to accept... it is definitely something I should consider

I have a pretty good relationship with the manager, so this is obviously something I would speak with him about. 
I like your suggestion; however, the company is going through a pretty hectic time right now, business is booming, they are relocating to a bigger facility... quite frankly I do not get enough time to sit down with my manager/owner to pitch this, but it is definitely something I could do in the future.
FYI  its a 2012 Impreza sport (stock exhaust... close though)

Thanks for the advice! I will give it a shot.

I know what you are saying. I have a feeling my manager would be fine with me doing it, I would be paying the moment I receive payment, so they would have nothing to lose. 
I guess the main reason why I would want to do this is because I want to accrue some BTC myself. I figured by going this route, we would become the first pizza parlor in the area, that would be accepting of BTC and quite frankly that really intrigues me...
