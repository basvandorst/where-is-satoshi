Only if there were enough transactions to fill a block that size.

It's more like an ISP raising their maximum throughput so their customers don't complain about slow speeds and switch providers.

Yes, a spam attack would do it, but say they were using the lowest fee currently accepted by miners of 1 satoshi per byte, to fill 1TB blocks it would cost them nearly 11000 Bitcoins, so at bitcoins current price for a 24-hour attack it would cost close to 3.4 Billion Dollars.  Even then any transaction that pays more than 1 satoshi per byte would get through and the network would keep running. -edit- fixed math.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:36:04
That was already done.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:28:47
Moving bitcoins currently cost 30+ dollars if you want to get it confirmed in a reasonable timeframe, sometimes not at all if the fee is too low. [Source](
As far as store of value the majority of bitcoin addresses hold 0.01 bitcoins or less which means that those people will either spend most of the value in transactions fees if they try to move them or be forever stuck in those addresses. [Source](
I know that people will say that other cryptocurrencies will have the same problem eventually since they don't have full blocks or as many transactions.  But if scaling isn't the top priority then it will be taken over by something that scales quicker.

Libertarians will cheer for anything that removes power from the government, I'll cheer with them, the whole point of bitcoin is to remove the government and banks from the equation. We cheer for no taxes, because they are theft, forced on you by the majority that thinks they can take your money "because it will provide services" we can get those services just as well or better from companies assuming the government doesn't side with those companies, that's when the problems start.  Leave the government completely out of it and the market will take care of it.  The government is less efficient and slower than most companies would be, and if the companies do cause problems you can fire them, unlike the government.

I guess I would have to see an example of that. If that is the case then I would agree with you.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:45:28
I misspoke, I meant that bitcoins value is that it used to be transacted and be a store of value, and right now people are just calling it a store of value, I agree that other cryptocurrencies would work well in the scenario you were describing but specifically bitcoin, while it would work would not work well because of the current high fees, say you only had 50 dollars in bitcoins or 50 dollars in another cryptocurrency, the other currency would be better because you would get more of the value back out of it. It could be that bitcoin will become that again. I'll edit my original post.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:12:37
Good point, I guess it could be seen that way.  I think that legally it shouldn't be an issue though, whether or not I think it's a scummy thing to do.  Now, If coinbase has a policy that they will fire the people that did the insider trading then fine, they run the company and they can do what they want with it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:19:16
Exactly, it's supposed to be a worldwide network and scales perfectly fine on chain, although I'm sure optimizations can be made and have been made.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:03:11
Peer to peer electronic cash isn't a currency?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:59:11
I think it will, but maybe I'm wrong. We'll see though, other coins are experimenting with large blocks, so we'll see where it goes.
I think that link is relevant.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:16:09
Yes, it was in place to prevent spam when the network was small. it was just never removed like it was supposed to be.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:31:33
I don't see a point in a poll of this type, they are easily gamed. No matter what your opinion is on it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:35:49
That's true. This is reason for the fees.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:46:07
Why not just use gold for that then? Bitcoins value used to be that it can be transacted and be a store of value.
I edited this to be more of what I meant, Bitcoin, as it stands now, doesn't work well for transacting.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:27:42
The miners aren't setting the fees.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:00:54
I'll use a different cryptocurrency that doesn't have this problem, that's my point, bitcoin is losing relevance. Maybe I misunderstood what you were saying.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:20:30
I couldn't care less what the value of bitcoin was at the time I bought something with it, that's the nature of a deflationary currency, what I can't stand is having to pay between 3 and 20 dollars just to get a confirmation on time, they need to fix this now, or another cryptocurrency will and maybe already has taken it's spot, bitcoin was meant as a payment system and store of value, without one you cannot have the other. If that's not the case then I may as well use gold, it's a better store of value.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:16:02
Oh you're talking about roger, I thought you were talking about this guy since he was calling himself the ceo
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:33:58
I fail to see how this is insider trading, it was fairly obvious that it was going to be added. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:29:40
You know the CEO part of that was a joke right?
"The Bitcoin Cash organization has no titles other
than those which we make up for fun in the spur of the moment, or to make fun of the
organizations of the old world that care for titles."

They would have to lock in the money for an amount of time, you can easily trade BCH for BTC and for any other cryptocurrency, equating it to a pyramid scheme is inaccurate even if you don't like the currency. What you describe is something similar to how bitconnect was running.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:49:59
24 minutes to confirm, but it will definitely confirm, that can't be said for the current bitcoin network. You set too low a fee now and it might never go through.
@_date: 2018-05-07 16:35:12
I agree, but I think the point is to eventually go past the 32MB limit. If that doesn't happen then I'll likely switch to a coin or chain that does, I have issues with limiting the throughput of the main chain even if we do make additional off chain networks, I think the fees even if very low will still be enough of a disincentive for someone that wanted to spam the network just to spam the network. When the network was smaller and the value was lower it would have been easier, I think that isn't the case now. Just my opinion obviously so we'll see if I'm wrong on that.
@_date: 2018-05-06 22:17:12
I think the idea is mainly to increase the block size limit to allow for more on chain transactions before reaching the limit, I think soon to be at 32MB max block size, which I think will be increasing more past that as well. Litecoin could be used but why switch between coins for transactions when it could be on one chain. If it doesn't keep increasing to keep up with transactions I'll likely switch to another one that does. I think having additional off chain technologies are fine, but not by limiting the base layer. Either way though as far as names go I just call them btc and bch. I think both will give us data on decentralized currencies, both of them may end up not being used and it'll be a different currency that's gets to be the majority currency.
@_date: 2018-08-23 18:17:46
More people know about BTC and want to get into it for the gains they are going to make. Doesn't make one of them better and one worse. I'm not sure what you mean by forever waiting on transactions, most of the time both of the chains verify in 10 minutes. Only difference is one can do 32MB blocks and the other 1 to 4MB-ish depending on segregated witness usage.
@_date: 2018-05-06 21:46:51
I don't think that everyone who supports Bitcoin Cash is automatically calling it Bitcoin, I own no Bitcoin because I saw what happened when there was a lot of use on the network, that's all, that's also the only reason I own Bitcoin Cash, because the block size is being increased before it gets hit hard by transactions. That is the only reason I have it since it seems to have the same properties as Bitcoin. I call them different names. I also don't call either of them bcore or bcash, I normally end up using the ticker.
@_date: 2018-05-07 17:22:28
I do think the name calling on both sides has become ridiculous, but just because someone who supports one side or the other says things that either aren't true or are just inflammatory doesn't mean that the technology is bad.  As long as we come out of this with a good currency (or multiple)that is fungible, finite and isn't controlled by a central bank I'll be happy, even if all the current cryptocurrencies fail for some reason.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:29:23
It's a difference of opinion, I tend to think the same as he does in that regard, less regulation is a good thing and regulating against insider trading is still regulation, the whole thing would have been fine if they let it settle normally rather than stopping the exchange.  I don't know about other people that use bitcoins but getting away from governments is certainly a motivation everyone seemed to share at one point.
@_date: 2018-03-10 00:32:35
I'm not sure you can really say that though, Bitcoin originally had no limit besides the 32MB protocol limit, then the 1MB limit was added in 2010, so you could say that that is the original and it ~~forked~~ changed from there.  I would think that it would be better to call them a distro like what has happened with Linux.  Either way, both are still Bitcoin. Just different types, since they both have the same ledger up to the point they forked. I agree you can't say that BTC or BCH or BTCD or any of the others are the same, since there are different tickers for those different "distros" and they have different prices.
@_date: 2018-03-10 02:08:57
Fork may not have been the right word then, It was a consensus change. If the old nodes (pre 1MB) generated a block that was larger than 1MB they would be rejected by newer nodes and accepted by old nodes, whichever one had more hashing power would then become the new chain unless one added replay protection.
@_date: 2018-03-10 16:48:39
I didn't say they were.
@_date: 2018-03-10 00:57:39
I'm a BCH fan and don't get upset about it, call it bcash, call it bitcoin, call it a turd on a stick, couldn't care less lol.
Although I also don't normally call either one Bitcoin, I just use BTC and BCH. I like competing currencies. Have them all compete so we can rid the world of central bank printed money.
@_date: 2018-03-10 02:35:39
You're right.
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:51:47
How is it centralized? What problem does funding for the company create? it's open source, if you don't like the direction they take it after this then fork it.
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:40:41
There's no reason I can think of that changing the block size should have taken this long... The fact is people want to use bitcoin as a currency as well as a store of value, but you can't use it as a currency if it takes more than 50 cents per transaction, and even that is insane. When you grow a network you increase throughput first then focus on optimization or you'll just get people angry at you and they'll use something else.  I hope this stalemate ends soon.
@_date: 2018-03-10 14:46:38
Litecoin doesn't increase the block size, that's the only major difference right now is the way the 2 are scaling, look, I'm not saying they aren't different, they are, but both of them are trying to do the same thing in different ways. I also really don't care what anyone wants to call it, BTC is a cryptocurrency, BCH is also a cryptocurrency, both were derived from the original bitcoin code, and both had the same ledger up until the point of the fork, just because of what some people say about either one of them that's what they are, we're arguing over semantics and it's ridiculous.
