Although a stock crash will signify to some people that the government is inept from preventing catastrophe, it is important to remember that bitcoin and many altcoins reached their high when the stock market was up. Both the stock market and crypto prices are generally a tell of the economic situation of our country and therefore tend to have similar ups and downs.

Best guess: someone put in the wrong key and accidentally sent it to you
Or, someone gave a random key some bitcoin as a random act of kindness

No sry - there are plenty on the darknet however. Keep in mind those are very sketchy and it’s not recommended to use them.

I mean there are a few places that accept btc but no, you can’t buy, sell, or trade on Coinbase without an id.

Well then there isn’t much you can do.
Either you have a parent sign up for Coinbase and transfer the money to there.
Or find another site that allows you to cash out without id(to my knowledge there aren’t many)
If you have a friend you could send it to them and have them pay you back in cash.
Or, last and best option.
Send it to me :)

Happy to help :)
Let me know if you have any other questions

If you can’t find a way that you like to exchange the btc I’d invest in another crypto that you think could go up

Not of the top of my head - there are certainly a few sites on the dark net that will do it, keep in mind however that they are fairly sketch and I would not recommend that
