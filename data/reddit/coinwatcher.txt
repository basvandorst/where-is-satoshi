I created it myself on Tradingview. All you need to do is open this chart:
1. Change the time-frame to month.
2. Click on "indicators" and scroll down and add the one which is named exactly "Moving Average". After you added "MA" on the chart then change the lookback period from the default which is 9 to 4 by opening the "format" option.
3. Change the "bar style" to 'line'.
4. You are done.

@_date: 2015-06-07 04:23:47
Yes exactly. The price and the average of the price are very close to each other this month. In fact much closer than in the last months during the downtrend. This means it is easy for the price here to stabilize and go upwards, because of this very close relationship to the average.

Two small bitcoin exchanges in China are stopping customer deposits in yuan, suggesting that exchanges are starting to take action after what people familiar with the matter say is a behind-the-scenes order from the central bank for payment companies and banks to close bitcoin trading accounts.
The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that according to these people, the accounts must be closed by April 15.
**One of the two exchanges, Shenzhen-based BTC38, is discontinuing bank transfers, saying it has received news of the central bank's intentions from banks and third-party platforms.**
**The other, Shanghai-based FXBTC, is ending deposits effective Thursday and suspending bank-card withdrawals on Sunday, saying it has received phone calls from several banks urging it to cancel accounts as soon as possible.**
The exchanges are less well-known than BTC China, Huobi and OKCoin—three of the platforms most commonly used by local investors—but their announcements are an indication of how murky regulatory directives are reining in the market without authorities' outlawing the digital currency completely.
The central bank moved in a similar fashion last December, when local media and industry participants say it ordered third-party payment platforms to stop working with bitcoin exchanges at a closed-door meeting but stopped short of addressing the exchanges directly. The only public announcement by the central bank was earlier that month when it barred financial institutions from dealing with bitcoin, but said people could buy and sell the virtual currency at their own risk.
"There's not much left for the exchanges if buying and selling bitcoins isn't really feasible due to funding restrictions," said Zennon Kapron, founder of Shanghai-based consultancy Kapronasia. "In the West, some exchanges provide merchant services," he said, "but that hasn't really developed in China."
Other analysts were less pessimistic. "It's a somewhat confusing situation right now in China," said Garrick Hileman, economic historian at the London School of Economics. "We're still waiting for an official announcement."
But he added, "A bank ban won't be the end of bitcoin in China. The exchanges have already demonstrated creative ways around banking restrictions."
Bitcoin activities like mining, the process of generating the currency by solving complicated math problems, can continue in China, he said, but in terms of exchanges, "the bitcoin story in China, at least in the near-term, is over," Mr. Kapron added.
BTC38 in a statement on its website late Wednesday said it "will comply strictly with the central bank's directive and rules," although it said yuan withdrawals and deposits in the virtual currency would continue.
Global bitcoin prices fell by roughly 3% after the statements by the Chinese exchanges Wednesday evening, according to CoinDesk's bitcoin price index, continuing a decline from last week when Chinese media reported the regulatory shift.
Still, some players appeared resistant to making adjustments. Several exchanges said they hadn't received any notice from the central bank or banks they work with.
BTC China spokesman Kenneth Ling said the exchange hasn't received notification from any banks. He declined to comment on what steps the exchange would take, but said yuan withdrawals were continuing as normal.
**Beijing-based exchanges Huobi, OKCoin and BTC Trade said they are discontinuing deposits via third-party payment platforms but still are allowing transfers through banks. In an attempt to ease investor worries, Huobi and OKCoin said they wouldn't stop yuan withdrawals.**
BTC Trade was another player that said it hadn't received any notice of the central bank directive. It added that investors should be "cautious" amid recent price volatility.
Regulators here are thought to be clamping down on bitcoin in order to maintain financial stability and protect retail investors, many of whom have been trading bitcoin for speculative purposes, given the scarcity of other options.

If you prefer the 2-of-3 model then sign-up at BitGo. But the reason why I recommended GreenAddress.it is for multiple reasons: They offer the nLockTime feature (saving your Bitcoin if the service goes down) and GreenAddress.it have an [Android App]( and most of their software is already [open source]( BitGo doesn't have an wallet app so far and I assume BitGo are not going to ever open source as much GreenAddress.it

The difference is that I use Blockchain.info to store some small amounts of BTC, but without backups so far (because those amounts are so small and I'm lazy).
Now that your service is down as far as I understand it, if GreenAddress.it is down and if I have 2FA activated at GreenAddress.it, I would have access to my small amounts of BTC just by waiting for the nLockTime to pass by, where as with Blockchain.info I currently need to annoy your team to create a backup for me.
Blockchain.info doesn't scale automatically in the same way GreenAddress.it does. I assume more people are going to activate 2FA (and automatically get at GreenAddress.it the nLockTime option) where as with Blockchain.info just having 2FA enabled is not enough to get access to the BTC once your service goes down completely -as it now happened.
I'm very lazy. So I'm always looking for the solution where I have to do the least amount of work and still get the most out of it. With Blockchain.info I have to care about making backups or requesting them from your service once your service is down - while as with GreenAddress.it I get them automatically after some time (as far as I understand).
I also don't want to use BitGo with their 2-of-3 model, because handling my own backup of my second private key again requires my own work and time to think about the long term security of this second key (not forgetting where or how it was stored), but I'm lazy so just keeping one sort of key (the mnemonic passphrase) is enough work. So GreenAddress.it seems to be the optimum in security performance versus time investment.

 (press the play button to see it update with the current chart data after his forecast)
The buy zone is somewhere between $550-$575. Just be patient, the price will drop there. And then the smart money buys back cheaper and we have a new uptrend. It's that simple.
I personally was expecting this downtrend to happen since the middle of July. It started because traders where disappointed that the $700 price couldn't be broken after two attempts. Here is prove from Reddit from July 12 (when the price was still at $626) that I was warning people about the risk of this downtrend. But off course my warning was downvoted to 0 points:

No. I was wondering if when Ethereum launches not with an premined IPO but like Bitcoin did, how this would work out. And then I thought about the issue when altcoin launch with a early pre-announcement they suffer from the problem that they get instamined from the biggest players in the room who have the largest mining rigs prepared, because they were able to be ready in advance.
If Bitcoin had a ninja-style launch without a pre-announcement (just announced when first or second block is mined), this would have meant that this could be a smarter way to launch even today.

This may be true on a pure "facts" basis.
But after speaking with my friends (none of them ever had Bitcoin and none of them so far this year wanted to buy Bitcoin), they all want to own 1 Bitcoin. Not a fraction of it, if they buy they want to own exactly one Bitcoin.
When I explained that it doesn't matter if they have 1 BTC or only 0.547 BTC they all replied that IF they buy Bitcoin, then they want to have ONE Bitcoin.

I agree. **[There is no fiat currency on earth which costs 500 US Dollar per unit](
* Kuwaiti Dinar (1 KWD = 3.51 USD)
* Bahrain Dinar (1 BHD = 2.65 USD)
* Omani Rial (1 OMR = 2.60 USD)
* UK Pound Sterling (1 GBP = 1.66 USD)
* European Euro (1 EUR = 1.31 USD)
* Cayman Islands Dollar (1 KYD = 1.22 USD)
* Switzerland Franc (1 CHF = 1.09 USD)
* Bitcoin (1 BTC = 500 USD)
If we go from counting in *bitcoin* to using *bits*, it would have another advantage - the more obvious distinction between Bitcoin, the blockchain-based technology and money (bits) as the first Bitcoin application which is running on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.
As of today there is a very confusing distinction between *bitcoin* and *Bitcoin*. Since Bitcoin is both a currency and a protocol, capitalization can be confusing. Accepted practice is to use Bitcoin (singular with an upper case letter B) to label the protocol, software, and community, and bitcoin (with a lower case b) to label units of the currency.
When we use bits to label units of the currency the entire confusion would go away, including the even more confusing mBTC, which is bitcoin counted in millibitcoin.

* [If you look at your power usage, it uses roughly 40-50% less power than standard scrypt too...it really is the best algo out there!](
* [Why x-11 is great? I can hash at least 4 times the speed of normal scrypt and have at least 15ºC cooler temperatures. What is not to love about Hirocoin?](
* [What we want is the attention of miners who will eventually look for a non-Scrypt GPU minable coin. The idea is to be the prominent coin in the next big GPU hashing tier.](
* [Looks like X11 is the way to go as far as hashing algorithms go. Darkcoin say that the wattage is half that of scrypt so I guess miners will prefer it this summer as well. Good luck with Hirocoin.](

Fred Wilson is like the Andreas Antonopoulos of Bitcoin - everyone follows every word he says in the venture capital industry. He is a must read source for every tech startup founder and VC in the US (and around the world).
In contrast to Andreas Antonopoulos, Fred Wilson also has lots of top connections in other industries outside of his own. If Bitcoin wins, then because of thought leaders like Fred Wilson, Andreessen Horowitz and Jeremy Liew, who have the power and right connections in the US to push Bitcoin to be used in large businesses.

You are right. I was thinking ahead and wanted to say some kind of automatic addition to every BTC payment transaction (value exchange) which goes to a savings account. Actually I would favor this being used to automatically donate for example to Bitcoin charities.

This was just a coincidence.
Last week when Xapo launched I was reading all the comments on Reddit and someone recommended BitGo and another person replied to him and recommend GreenAddress.it.
Today when Blockchain.info was still down someone was promoting his own blockchain explorer service with a very similar headline and I thought what I great headline, but only a blockchain explorer.
So I just thought GreenAddress.it is a great alternative and the Reddit community voted it up very quickly. The only cooperation was that I told GreenAddress.it on Twitter that my Reddit post escalated very quickly and was on page one on Reddit about 20 minutes after I posted it - telling them they might prepare for a lot of traffic today.
The main reason is why I recommended on Reddit is because I hate it when a single service dominates a market when there are other good services out there (which sometimes even close down after some years, because of too few users).
Last time I found such an underdog was with [Strip]( when I was researching cross-platform password-managers. Nobody knows Strip. Everyone knows LastPass, despite there have been a very deep security analysis by experts where only Strip was found to be secure and all other competitors including LastPass and 1Password were not. Everyone uses LastPass, just because everyone uses LastPass. I hate those echo chambers.
If I have had more time I would have not only recommended GreenAddress.it but like 3-10 services if there are such many great alternatives, but only GreenAddress.it crossed my mind immediately when Blockchain.info wallets went down.

"Wences Casares, the 40-year-old founder and chief executive of Xapo has devoted most of his career to creating financial products. He developed Patagon, one of Argentina's first online financial-services firms, which was acquired by Banco Santander for $750 million. He also founded Banco Lemon, a Brazilian bank for the underbanked, which was later sold to Banco de Brasil, and more recently Lemon.com, an online wallet, which LifeLock Inc. bought in December for $50 million."
""I grew up in Argentina," Casares says. "My parents were sheep ranchers, and I saw them lose everything at least three times. Once because of inflation, once because of deflation and once because their savings were confiscated. I recognize that those are extremes but, when you grow up in that environment you become much more aware of problems with currency. So when I saw bitcoin it was like a dream."

You are right that buying at the bottom would make you rich. But obviously your chart analysis is not good enough, otherwise you would have cut losses, sold earlier and haven't bought back again and again in bull traps.
In your shoes I would just sell now and wait until the price drops down to $85-$100 and buy back there in case that we find a real bottom there.

If you have $1000 and the price per Bitcoin is $500 you can buy with your $1000 exactly 2 BTC. If you sell the 2 BTC for $450 you have $900 left. Now if you buy back BTC cheaper for $400 you can buy with your $900 exactly 2.25 BTC. **From 2 BTC to 2.25 BTC is an increase of 12.5%**
If you have $300 and the price per Bitcoin is $500 you can buy with your $1000 exactly 0.6 BTC. If you sell the 0.6 BTC for $450 you have $270 left. Now if you buy back BTC cheaper for $400 you can buy with your $270 exactly 0.675 BTC. **From 0.6 BTC to 0.675 BTC is an increase of 12.5%.**

The idea behind ASIC-resistance is to avoid centralization. Centralization means that only rich people can become richer, because they are the only ones who can afford to buy powerful ASIC miners.
ASIC miners are devices that are much much faster in mining than your CPU or GPU, because it is hardware with the only goal to be as fast as possible doing just one job: mining a particular coin.

Vertcoin is ok. But Vertcoin is not the best answer. I spoke with Adam Back, the inventor of Hashcash. Hashcash is the underlying idea behind Bitcoin's proof of work. 
Adam Back says hardware always wins against software. It is only a matter of time and a solution to Vertcoin's anti-ASIC will be created. Maybe not tomorrow, but in a few years or in a decade. When this happens the centralization of Vertcoin will be even worse, because only those who created this very expensive special solution to ASIC mine Vertcoin will be able to afford it. Making in the end the centralization of Vertcoin even worse than it is in Bitcoin.
The other problem of Vertcoin is that the anti-ASIC feature of Vertcoin makes mining VTC even more energy costly than mining normal Scrypt. So Vertcoin is wasting even more energy than mining Bitcoin or Litecoin.
Adam Back didn't specifically answer my question about Vertcoin, but the same lessons from Litecoin apply to Vertoin.

While doing my master thesis and researching in the doctor thesis of many doctors in economics I learned that like 30%-40% have no idea of the real underlying mechanics their theories are based on and then they come to wrong conclusions. But these people are great in marketing their own narrow viewpoints to people who have an even smaller understanding of the subject.

This isn't heasay. [Karl Gray said he was aware of in Bitcoin in the year 2009.](
History: Version 0.1 of Bitcoin was released in January 2009. In May 2010 someone paid 10,000 bitcoins for a pizza worth $25.
Speculation: Let's say that after he already knew about Bitcoin since 2009 - that Karl Gray was really smart - and accumulated in 2010 bitcoins back then worth $25,000 (~10,000,000 BTC).
Now if he still holds 1/4 of that investment from 2010 (2,500,000 BTC) he would today (April 2014) own bitcoins currently worth ~$1,140,000,000 or around 1 Billion US Dollar.
On the Keiser Report Karl Gray publicly acknowledged that he owns around [100,000 BTC]( which would still make him a Multimillionaire, because those Bitcoins are now worth ~$45,000,000.
So; we have someone on Twitter who is at least a Bitcoin Multimillionaire - who said that he met with someone who they don't name, who works for a "major US bank", claiming that the banking sector is terrified of Bitcoin.
Sounds reasonable to me.

**TLDR: Mt. Gox is in bankruptcy protection, meaning they believe they can still recover the bitcoins with some time, because the bitcoins are only temporarily unavailable, NOT lost. Now in the press event he said they "identified the problem" speculation puzzle: [how to the recover the keys to their coldest-cold storage where the bitcoins of customers are saved].**
I don't have any money at MtGox, but it makes me really angry when there is an entire room full of journalists who were paid to go there - as this is part of their job - and non of them does his job and reports that MtGox found the problem and that they are "working on it".
What I hear in the video is:


That doesn't sound like some external third party (hacker) is blamed here, but these morons and his shitty tech management is to blame. 
I guess that was not the agenda the media wanted to get out. This "hey they lost everything forever" sounded much better to get attention...
**If they really found the problem that means the Bitcoin weren't "stolen", but this idiot [lost the access to the 'cold' storage as many experts already speculated]( (more [here - "The Ghost in the Machine at MtGox"](

When I watched a Youtube video explaining how a Bitcoin wallet works I had an *holy cow, this is amazing* epiphany moment in 2013, after being aware of Bitcoin since early 2011 before the first bubble, which turned me off.

Mintpal is really great. They have great interface and high volume and a good selection of altcoins. When the Heartbleed bug came I checked them and they had already fixed the problem way before all other exchanges.
Most exchanges have either only a great user interface, but no volume, or some good coins, but a bad UI and no volume. They even released an App for iOS to check the prices on mobile. Mintpal is simply awesome.
Here are some other high volume altcoin exchanges: 
Besides Mintpal you might consider Bter. Bter also has a good interface and a few good coins and high volume, but not as great as Mintpal. C-Cex is also ok in terms of usability. Poloniex has a great selection of new coins and an ever higher volume than C-Cex but I have connections issues with the login in all the time at Poloniex lately.
* 1. Mintpal

Bittrex and AllCrypt have lots of coins. But their user interface is beyond terrible and they have no volume. It's a waste of time.

If BitGo goes down who use the 2-of-3 model with two keys needed (either one key from the user and one key from BitGo or two keys from the user) the user can still access his Bitcoin using his backup key.
If GreenAddress.it goes down who use the 2-of-2 model with one key needed from each side, the user can still access his Bitcoin with only the same one key after some time thanks to the nLockTime feature.
So in both cases if the user is hacked (someone gets his key and can get past his 2FA) and the service is not down, the hacker can access the Bitcoin with the user's key.
Now with the 2-of-3 model of BitGo if both the two user keys get hacked (stored at the same place) from the user, the hacker can access the Bitcoin even without having to get past the user's 2FA for BitGo? Because he already has two keys?
But with GreenAddress.it the hacker who got the user's key also has to hack the user's 2FA for GreenAddress.it to access the Bitcoin?
To access the Bitcoin of a GreenAddress.it user the attacker has to hack the GreenAddress.it server which stores one side of the two keys AND the GreenAddress.it user and his 2FA for GreenAddress.it?
The hacker has to get the encrypted private keys from the the GreenAddress.it server and shut the server down and hack the user and his other Bitcoin address where the Bitcoin are moved with nLockTime?
Is this somewhat correct?

Please write in your article that Bitcoin are safe. You can print them on paper and store the print wherever you want, for example in a bank.
And not only can you print Bitcoin on paper. You can print multiple copies of so called "paper wallets". So if you lose one copy for exampling because of a fire in your house, you still have your Bitcoin.
And not only can you store Bitcoin on paper in multiple physical locations of your choice - you can also secure the printed Bitcoin "cold storage" with a password that is needed to use the printed Bitcoin.
In case people are lazy. There are more secure online wallets that require multiple keys to get your Bitcoin, like  and 
Since the above are difficult to use. There is a new option for consumers [Xapo]( where the Bitcoin are insured and you only need to remember a 4 digit PIN. Xapo just raised 20 Million US Dollar from leading venture capital firms and the company was founded by someone with experience in this area.
But it's easier to just write that Bitcoin is doomed, because people lost money at MtGox...

@_date: 2014-08-23 11:25:14
Bitcoin is hard to understand. And the news media focuses on drama and negative stories, because this is what people are interested in. Since "Bitcoin has all the hallmarks of a scam" and the news media loves stories that feel like they are exposing things that are rotten in the core - the majority of news about Bitcoin that gains the most attention in the mainstream is negative.
Last example was GHash:
The Guardian was the first big major mainstream news source to cover the new 51% Ghash event in the summer.
- Bitcoin currency could have been destroyed by '51%' attack 
 
Which I bet was the inspiration for the AP (Associated Press) to write a news article which then was republished at all newspapers around the world. Just a few examples:
- (India) Bitcoin faces new threat 
 
- (Canada) Bitcoin faces previously unimaginable threat: Takeover by a pool of 'miners' 
 
- (Russia) Bitcoin currency vulnerable after anonymous miner takes 51% network share 
 
- (UK) Is Bitcoin facing a takeover? Investors are rattled as mining group gains control of half the currency's computer power 
 
Since Bitcoin is decentralized and not a company (and because the Bitcoin Foundation is doing a poor job) -- there is no "official Bitcoin public relation person" stepping in and trying to correct the inaccuracies in the media about Bitcoin. Therefore all the inaccurate news lives on and gets copied by other clueless journalists, creating all these highly misleading negative stories about Bitcoin.
But since average people still trust mainstream media to make up their mind, they end up dismissing Bitcoin when they read mainstream news about it.
I mean even some people who were savvy enough to become a Reddit user and read news in r/Bitcoin [have no clue how Bitcoin works](

Bitcoin is an open-source decentralized technology that not only reduces costs and friction associated with existing transaction types such as credit cards, wire transfers, etc., but enables a whole new set of transactions including micro and nano payments that existing payment technologies are unable to contemplate, let alone address."

24 hours later the price crashed to $225 (and I mentioned that I posted the warning):
* 
and then I posted this chart while we were at the bottom below $200 after we hit $152 on Bitstamp:
* 
But most people don't want to sell before the price crashes or buy when the price is low, so it got almost no upvotes. That's why you didn't see any of this on the front page of r/Bitcoin. I can't do more then submit the right tips at the right time. I bought all-in at $180, because I knew we wouldn't fall even lower for a while. The despair was too great.

Traders are trading the trend. Forecast yesterday was "it’s open season on the panic and we can see US$200-225 very quickly."
Now Bitstamp has flash-crashed from $270 to $225 in 20 hours.  Don't tell me you weren't warned that this could happen. There was a reason I posted that article as a warning to prevent a panic.

I also had this moment with sleepless nights following it. It came to me when I knew nothing about Bitcoin and watched a Youtube video which explained how (easy) a user can send BTC of his wallet to another address.
I was like: holy cow, this technology feels like when I first used p2p file-sharing back when Napster launched in 1999, but this is disrupting money!!!

The price went up too fast too high between October 2013 and December 2013 (round about 1300% in only two months). 
This was unsustainable, after MtGox crashed and all newspapers around the world still mention the MtGox crash when they write about Bitcoin in 2015. It also did not help that Bitstamp was hacked this year.
The price is still inside this old downtrend which began in January 2014. That is the only reason why we are down 25% this year.

It's actually not an article that was written by a USA Today journalist, but it was written by [Patrick Murck]( who is General Counsel at the Bitcoin Foundation.
I guess we have to wait 3-4 years until a USA Today journalist comes to the same conclusion by his own...

I have heard from someone who spoke with several high ranking German regulators (because they are starting with their own Bitcoin exchange in Germany) that Bitcoin.de are operating in some kind of grey area where the regulators so far are only not acting to close it down (cutting them a break).

1. If you think not Bitcoin only: There are alternatives that consume less energy like Peercoin and NXT coin due to prrof-of-stake. And then there are ways to use that processing power in the network that wastes electricity to find solution against cancer and other diseases for example: [Gridcoin](
2. This is just a matter of time until new startups release more user friendly products. Also there are solutions like multi-sig which make it much harder to lose your Bitcoin. Here is a recent Wired article about [one of those services](
3. I have no problem with online wallets, but people need to use multi-sig online wallets
4. There will be solutions to this when it becomes a critical problem
5. Maybe Bitcoin can be taken down, but not Namecoin for example. I assume NXT coin would also be more difficult.
6. Malware is only a problem when you keep everything online. There are solutions like:  (hardware) and  (their [paper storage explained here]( The media is going to write about it and then people will start to use those solutions to not lose all their money.
7. There are alternatives like Zetacoin which has a block time of 30 seconds and also uses SHA-256 or Dogecoin with a block time of 60 seconds. And some people are working on solutions for Bitcoin like this one: [**ESCHATON** Draft paper]( and [PoC]( 
8. As more people invest the volatility will go more and more away. It's just a numbers game. If the market volume consisted of you and me as the only player it would be radically volatile... as 1 billion people join Bitcoin, that will go away.
9. See this [video explaining multi-sig]( And read this about [multi-sig used for payments](
9999. You didn't ask about anonymous transactions, but "Darkwallet" is working on that for Bitcoin.

The media loves to report if the price falls. But never when the prices rises, unless it's a bubble that will burst anyway. Like that one in December 2013.

Guess why... Trading is all about psychology and buying low and selling high.
In order to buy low the market makers (those who can move the price) have to sell to get the price in a price decline so they can buy back even lower later. Nobody who is a professional day trader buys when the price is high. The only who lose money are those who buy when the price is high and sell when the price gets cheaper, while rich market makers do the opposite. They sell into "strength" while the price goes up and buy when the price goes down. It's not visible in the price until average market participants buy while the price starts to get more expensive again, while the market makers meanwhile sell to them and take profit.
Here is some related explanation:

I was laughed at for recommending Twitter as a growing trend to take serious in 2009 when the service was already "established" in early adopter circles since 2007.
Today in 2015 you see Twitter being recommended on mainstream television to extend a discussion with TV viewers.

Well, you have to be aware that if they recommended to buy at six cents and today Bitcoin is worth around 200 US Dollar, that the downside risk is that the price could slowly slide down the next months to:
100 US Dollar
50 US Dollar
25 US Dollar
12 US Dollar
6 US Dollar
I don't think we will ever see this price again though:
0.06 US Dollar
