megaupload got taken down for very similar reasons to this.

I won't because its still useless


Why wouldn't they just include transactions normally that's just making it more unprofitable.


They could just stick $10 worth of bitcoin on the device and it'd give you more than a year of mining.

Well, then it's good AVG is protecting him from altcoin scams.

I suppose you haven't seen  then?
@_date: 2015-09-09 13:06:56
Yeah we assume so. The last 4 bytes of a bitcoin address are a checksum which is used prevent typos so the same address ending in 3 would be invalid.
Edit: as to your last question I looked it up after someone mentioned the shorter addresses. I don't know if there's anything looking at them.
@_date: 2015-09-09 19:49:28
This one wasn't generated. The numeric value of this address (0) makes pretty much certain no one happened to generate this address.

Ok, so proportionally each one of these would generate 1/10,000,000 of the current hash power which would therefore be entitled 1/10,000,000 of the block size (this doesn't really change, more devices means more users to share between).
So that means that each one of these devices can be a free transaction every.... 35 days!
Instead we could give them 400$ which would allow them to make 8000 transactions or one transaction every 35 days for the next 766 years.
The device might be useful because of its hype but that's about it.

Likely a screw up and some bad code. Mt Gox did something similar  .

One of the shortest address is  but I doubt anyone actually has a private key to a 27 char address or even 28 for that matter.

They are basically encouraging Bitcoin adoption with this.

Let me just whip up a quick P = NP proof.

It doesn't directly hold bitcoin but the provider likely does hold bitcoin otherwise they would lose out if the bitcoin price increased.

Haha, true but I'm not the one using sockpuppets to spam my product.
