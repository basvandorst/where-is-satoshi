How did you work out the 61k€? Do you have any sources I could follow as I'm considering doing this. Other threads I've seen debate the reality of this, arguing if you're just attempting tax avoidance this won't work. Need true facts.

what do you mean, limited? does it work or not? what features are there?

How long do you have to live there before cashing out tax free and leaving the country?

Is this really necessary? Especially if you're just taking the safe path and declaring everything? I can file a tax return - why do I need someone else to do it?

Litecoin is a shitcoin. It's a clone of bitcoin with a few parameters changed. You want to diversify into different block chain tech.

I think you should send the money back. You don't need ten grand to help somebody.
@_date: 2018-03-03 09:25:43
It's a good philosophy when bitcoin has huge gains compared to everything else. But consider the case when it has multi year bear markets. I still think the general rule of diversifying your portfolio is a good one. Even Tom Lee, bitcoin analyst, says to go long housing in his recent lecture.

Yeah I don't see the significance of living a few miles apart. His first name isn't satoshi anyway its Dorian. So how would Finney even know satoshi? If he looked him up in the phone book it'd say nakamoto, Dorian. I think this line of reasoning is flawed.

Depends when you bought tho. If you bought at $100 that's not very much.

so the attack is when you've left your email logged in, a user can use your mail to contact the exchange and ask for password reset? but the exchange is set with 2FA - how would this work?

can't you still use the wallet to store bitcoins and perform offline transactions without the blockchain being fully synced? at worst case you can extract the keys and import them into electrum, no? u/achow101 u/goatpig_armory
