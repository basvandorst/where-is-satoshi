OMG, this. This never crossed my mind but this above all things. Support the creators so they need to bother with those pesky adds.

A high value means people are trading in their fiat for bitcoin, which could mean (and probably does at this point) speculation, but it could also mean adoption. If the US where to all of a sudden have a 20% bitcoin acceptance and use rate in 2 weeks, prices would level out a skyrocket high price because of the laws of supply and demand. High value I also believe adds stability, prices drops 50 bucks at 150 a coin, HUGE PROBLEM, price drops 50 bucks at 1000 a coin, a smaller problem.

I would say around 80 percent. I had some extra money I'm holding on to long term and I bought in relatively early.

really? you can't get your BTC out of Mt Gox? I've read (only a few times though) that if your fiat is stuck there you should just transfer out your BTC but thanks for the heads up, I will definitely be staying away from there now.

I like the idea. Im on new quite often looking for stories related to bitcoin in the senate and things like large new backers of bitcoin.
