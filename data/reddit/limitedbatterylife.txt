Look, it is simple, do not day trade. Do not panic. Hodl. You will make as much or near as much with 1/3rd the anxiety.
The trick is that it really looks like you can make money but once in a while a manipulator will manipulate the market so bad that people like you and me will lose money, zeroing out any profit you may have made. 99.9 percent of the people cannot guess it.
Be vary of three things: 1-adrenaline is addictive. 2-Losing hurts more than winning makes happy. 3-if you must daytrade show restraint and PATIENCE. Bitcoin will prevail at the end of the day. Ignore all manipulation and do not panic sell.
Hindsight is always 20-20, you will notice all the money you have missed and eventually act rash because of it. 
Always have security money set aside. If you spend it you will act emotionally. Fear is helluva drug. Always keep some amount of cash/deposit somewhere in case you must start again.
Last but not least, guessing when or if the price will go up or down makes little winnings if you cannot guess the other side. Most people can guess a drop a few minutes ahead if not hrs. The trick is how much it will go up if you must make a winning. If it will stop going up also. Sometimes it doesn't and that's when people panic.
Last but not least, do not put money you are not comfortable losing into emerging tech/investment/crypto etc. 250 gone is 250 gone, maybe you will make 500 tomorrow and lose 1000 the day after. Who knows.

Thanks for the answer. Interesting point. So we should not be afraid of large purchases of bitcoin by institutions? I mean there is nothing to prevent them, but if I held a large proportion of a desired commodity with a finite amount in the market that would put me in control of it, to a point where I could infinitely profit from it.

look friend,
Bitcoin is a risky investment even if it looks like it will be the future of money. On top of that it takes considerable self control to keep up with what is happening regularly with bitcoin. Lots of big cats and greedy people are trying to manipulate and use it to their own means.
That being said your father has a point. Start doing better at school. I mean not necessarily school, because schools often suck, but my point is that gained knowledge is the best investment that anybody could ever hope for. It will not only give you means to make money in turbulent times but it will also give you an idea on how to spend it wisely.
One day if bitcoin ever replaces money, people will still need houses, food, art and science to go on about their daily lives. With all this investment craze we will just have an extra bunch of rich jerks with tiny penises waving their lambos around.
1btc is not a small amount of money. Do not ever post how much money you have on the internet.... Never!

Asking great questions. I've also read some stuff about bitfinex pumping the price artificially. Would love to learn a bit more from the people who are more knowledgeable.
edit: looking at gdax volume bars, I am seeing quite a sizable purchase that pushed the 7900 to 8000 mark. More than 1300 bitcoins. That is quite a bit, 10.400.000 worth was traded within 5 minutes. I do not exactly know how to read these types of graphs so I am just guessing v means volume :D. Still the price feels like it is being pumped. For these situations we should come up with a reverse HODL idea, something like BUY'NT, as in it reached an artificial ATH, do not buy, just wait till it cools down a bit.

Sometimes it takes a bit long. You imagine with the recent influx of buyers things may be a bit crazy in any of the exchanges. I usually first send a tiny amount to check how long things take.

try not to disclose personal information online unless it is a throw-away account. Even then, do not give specific information.

coinbase is beginner friendly and is a safe way of buying bitcoins. The fees are a bit high though. You can always do some research later how to get to GDAX (an exchange ran by coinbase) which has much lower fees.
edit: since you are a new bitcoin buyer here's the full list of casual warnings:
Just Remember the golden rules:
* ABH: always be hodling, that means do not sell your bitcoins at moments of mass panic
* DON'T SILLY: do not disclose how much money you have online (bitcoin or dollars) it is just silly and puts you at risk of phishing.
* PRIVATE PARTS: if you do not own your own private key you do not own your bitcoins
* HARD &amp; SAFE: safest and best way of keeping your bitcoins are hardware wallets
* CAVEAT: do not buy bitcoins with lent money, always invest what you are willing to lose, bitcoin is volatile and an emerging tech yet
* also do not day trade
maybe some other nice folks will add some more advice.

@_date: 2017-11-22 08:06:23
it means that sellers are holding off at certain values and have set positions vs. buyers are waiting for a dip. That means nothing in itself because some news or fatcat can influence the price rise/drop, and change that graph on a whim.
Do not watch the graph, that is how coinbase tricks you into thinking you can profit/guess drops and rises so you do market orders and pay fees.

The amount is not important. Smaller fry are often more vulnerable to wide scale hacking/phishing as they have lesser means of protection, more vulnerable, and more unlikely to follow recourse. If I had bajillions on my account I would 1-not mention it on the internet, 2-have my reddit password something other than 12345678 3-pay attention to stay anonymous more than the next guy who is posting his SELFIE for god's sake.

You are asking people to share information in a way which may be harmful to them. Only good answer is: invest money you do not mind losing. 


You are asking a question that no-one can answer. Basically yes, because buying all time high is silly. Practically no, because the damned thing won't dip and the community speculates that it will rise much much more in value. DO NOT ASK A BARBERSHOP IF YOU NEED A HAIRCUT. Also do not ask for advice or take advice from strangers on the internet.


You are a sharp one aren't you? Again investment advice... Don't.... Make research come to your own conclusions. If you cannot do the research then do not invest in speculative internet currency.
