Yes, some people are like that. Girls.
Hehe, not serious.

Bad example. It's never bad to learn objective C.
The $100 fee filters out thousands of bad developed programs. Yes, it's bad for the poor developers, but good for the consumer. (And great for Apple, obviously)

Uh, I'm not following you there man. Quark is even _more_ decentralized than Bitcoin, because of the expensive mining that's limiting bitcoins to rich people only. (I'm talking about ASIC mining from bfly labs etc.)
It would be nice if you could talk serious instead of what you're doing. Bitcoin uses 1 cryptography, and Quark uses 6, wouldn't that make it more secure?
And please, no responses like this:


@_date: 2014-01-12 00:55:25
How can you back up your claims?


I'm thinking about that one. Are there any negative sides about the security of Quark that I'm not aware of? Please do tell me if you know!
@_date: 2014-01-12 01:42:27
Sounds like you're in denial right now.
Of course it is more secure, stop pretending it's not. It's ridiculous.

As others have said, if you spent 10 minutes without figuring it out, I think the PEBCAK ;) I spent literally 3 second before I figured it out.

I'm reading what you're saying, but I'm just not sure if to take it seriously, because all you're saying is that you disagree with how it was launched, therefore it's not better than Bitcoin?
The launch was definitely controversial, but and the first 6 months of mining has ended, but do you think that it will be a problem to distribute it amongst people?
(I'm thinking about Satoshi that mined the first coins alone)
@_date: 2014-01-12 01:35:38
I've done some research myself, and it turns out that Quark is only 6 months old, but it's catching up to Litecoin in terms of how many coins the wallets have. It was something like 100 of the top wallets had a little over 50% of the QRK, and the top 100% wallets of Litecoin had around 50% as well. And that's kind of weird, because Litecoin has been around for quite some time now.
So the coin doesn't seem to suffer from big whales more than what Litecoin, Peercoin etc. does.
Bitcoin, of course, is way 'better' in this case though, but it's the oldest so it's natural.
And the coins were never mined before they went public, were they? Weren't they mined after it was launched in public?
Those are the reasons that I've read on when people claim that Quark is a scam, but after doing some research, those claims are completely false. That's why I created this thread, because I was wondering if there was anything else to it.
@_date: 2014-01-11 23:45:33
I remember that post, it got mentioned on However, that's more than 1 month ago, and it seems that ever since Quarkcoin has gotten attention, Litecoin and Bitcoin have become more united, and then Quark was the new hate object?
Of course, there are alot of people that only believe in Bitcoin, but it seems to me that Litecoin is more accepted than it was in November.

Oh god these are _horrible_. Anyone could just copy a picture from google and paste it on that site.

At least tip a few bucks. This is just annoying.
It's normal for bitcoin tippers to tip a bear, not just half a cent...
Edit: beer, not bear

Way to be a fucking idiot and not explaining why the problem raised isn't the case.
Literally nothing in your comment adds any value to the conversation. While many others tries to educate OP, you're just being a douchebag, scaring away potential new users of Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-02-03 22:28:26
Well he is technically correct. If there was only 300.000 satoshis available to every human MAX, it would be a problem. It's just not the case. But it would be a flaw.

In a few weeks: "It's not a good thing after all?!?"
I mean seriously, EVERY time there's news about Bitcoin, it's apparently ALWAYS good, no matter what.
They could theoretically crash Bitcoin. The feds have that power at the moment, and it's a _good_ thing?
@_date: 2014-01-11 23:43:52
Ok, it's a different model, and I can see how it benefits the early adopters. But it's completely new though, shouldn't we give it a chance to see if it actually works? I'm just being open-minded here.

Pay for the development tools? Xcode is completely free...

Ok, while I personally think that Litecoin (which is what got me in this market) is basically a Bitcoin clone, other than that it uses Scrypt and it has faster blocks and more coins, I think that Quarkcoin actually adds something of value.
The "problem" with Bitcoins is the 10 minute block times, correct? Quark is way faster than that, and it has got more coins, and it's more secure, so it would make more sense to use Quark for daily use, such as going to the super-market etc., then use Bitcoins for bigger transactions such as cars, houses, computers, etc.
Obviously that raises the question: why not just use Quark instead of Bitcoin?
I don't know, but I like Bitcoins, and I don't know why Quark isn't all we need.
The most likely answer is this, tough: We will use cryptos in the future, but Bitcoins might not be _the_ one.
@_date: 2014-01-17 22:55:07
Yes, it is ;) It's completely free.
@_date: 2014-01-12 01:59:43
Ok, so your problem with Quark is the way you was introduced to it?
Not sure if there's any truth to the Max Keiser/Bill Still thing, there's no proof of it.
But what you're basically saying is that there's no fundemental errors in the coin itself (other than the launch which no one knows if was good or bad, we'll see), but because shouted that Max and Bill pumped it up, you were turned off?
Alright, I think I got it, and to be honest, I think it's the case with most users. They read that it was a scam, and that it was pumped by Bill Still, so they were instantly turned off, and whenever they see Quark, they downvote. It's just ignorance, of course, but it answer my question though.

Ah, looks like someone thinks that specs = good phone.


Really? No. The thing about iPhones is that what they _can_ do, they do excellent. Apple doesn't release 100 new things with new phones, they focus on perfecting 20 things instead.
Apple maps doesn't suck at all. It used to, but today, it's my favorite maps app. The maps are way better than Google's in my city, and the 3d view is cool. Google street view is awesome too, which is why I also have that installed.


Not true at all. It's actually very useful. I used to think the same as you until I got my own iPhone 5s. The sensor is very nice to have, especially with my jailbreak. (Allows me to use it for more cool stuff)


and fun and interesting, but why?
To prepare for the future. It's the same as asking _why_ other companies include NFC in their phones. _Future_.


It's because the iPhone is fully optimized hardware- &amp;amp;amp; software-wise. My iphone 5s uses ~300mb ram in normal mode. Why would I need more than 1GB? 
Specs != performance.
Sorry for kinda long reply, but nothing you say is true.

Who cares about Zynga to be honest? Ok, I get that it's (or was) a huge company, but it's most for children I guess?
But of course, many people probably took bitcoin a little bit more serious because of Zynga taking it serious.

Great, they should add quark as well, because it is getting more recognition. You can already buy anything on the internet with quark, using a website that allows you to spend quark on amazon, ebay etc. (there are 2 atm.)
I know alt currencies isn't popular around here, but it has proven itself to be popular, and it's going to stay even if we like it or not. When we can start accepting alt currencies such as Litecoin and Quarkcoin, bitcoin will be more stable as well. They are complimenting eachother, not stealing from Bitcoin.

Premined : mined before public release. Why do you toss out words you don't understand? It makes this post as a whole awfully bad when the author is not competent.

People on this subreddit disgusts me. Seriously, what is wrong with you? What is wrong with this video?
Can't  a man change his mind about bitcoins? Why do you even call him a hipocrit for it? Stop involving emotions on everything you do on Reddit, it would be for the better for us all.
The bitcoin subreddit is seriously close to being as circlejerky as is. 
Bitcoin = godlike
altcoins = shit, burn in hell
quark = scam, burn in hell
bill still changing his mind? FUCK HIM FOR NOT PRAISING LE BASED BITCOIN ALREADY!
AM I RITE GUISE?
You people behave like kids. Grow up.

Yes, it IS a bubble. Yes, it WAS a bubble. It doesn't mean that it's impossible for the price to exceed the previous top after the bubble has popped.
This subreddit is ridiculous, the amount of "pep-talking" is cringeworthy (especially the suicide hotline).

If you want, you can still jailbreak your iphone while you still have it. I'm not sure if there is a good bitcoin wallet app for it yet, but it will definitely come soon. Visit if you want more info.

Seeing as Satoshi owns ~1M bitcoins, shouldn't we call bitcoin a scam as well?

Can you show me sources, for, you know... ALL of your statements about Quark coin? How do you know it's wealth is spread around in a group of few people, and not alot of people? Seriously, this Quark-hate is just sad. Really shows the true side of people. I'm also invested in Litecoins as you, but I don't feel the need to bash on Quark coin just to promote Litecoins for personal profit.
@_date: 2013-12-19 10:51:23
No. How about you actually use the picture in the OP as a context for my comment. Ridiculous growth over short time is a bubble. That doesn't mean that the value can go past that at a later time.
The OP is implying that the bubbles were in fact, not bubbles, because of the value is higher at a later period.
