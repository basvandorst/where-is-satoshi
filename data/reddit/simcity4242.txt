Where do you think the funding is going? More servers? Better UI? $30.5 million in ฿? Or.... Maybe Blockchain are going to be making other blockchains? Because if you want to invest in the technology, where do you go? I can see why Andreas left now. Blockchain is not going to be just BTC methinks.

I never understood why he went dark until recently. 
I'd never, in a million years, release my identity if I were him. A more pertinent question is, "what would Satoshi think of Bitcoin 5 years on"? I'd have to think he'd be disappointed. I am. 
Why? Because the only concern is price. Not development or discussion on improvements... Just hoards of people waiting to get rich while 4 core developers do all the work

Good to know the banks will never allow that to happen! Also, remind this guy gold (aka a world currency) was brought to baby Jesus, along with Frankenstein and space station Mir. If he doubts such things have him translate the Ancient Greek and/or Hebrew texts for you.
Also, the Rapture wasn't invented until ~200BC (200 years before Kirk Cameron) and it's not in the bible.
All of these things are great things to discuss with fundamentalist Christians. Just remember they're different people in that they believe strange things and are like a cult. Christians too!

Have got dealt with support? I'm not stuck with a regulatory issue. I've literally shown proof of EVERYTHING and support (Gene) would continously tell me to check my wallet balance and I ended up giving up thinking it's not worth 25+ hours for funds totalling only around $180

your name is "exchanges_suck". Because they rip you off right? It's not your brilliance it's their incompetence! Does trouble follow you around but maddeningly their fuck ups aren't ever enough? Well on the bright side you'll never have anyone in your life who's good enough. And if you did, they may find things you say to be not so nice. If you thought about other people there may be hope. But start trying out your internet persona on real life people and you'll find the sting of being a complete failure as a human is not off put with up votes of your "friends". In fact I'd be so bold as to say Gentoo may not want your PSA since they operate Linux and not a gen2 iPhone App Store.
I used to be an angry person like you. It's been smooth sailing since I subscribed from this subreddit though. Keep it real man. You're a legend in your own mind and I just know Andreas would love to know he's got your approval. 
From your 196 points it's clear downvotes are the hard thing to get here. Bring me on.

In a nutshell, I've been dealing with mtgox support for WEEKS trying to get a credit for a bank deposit which the bank didn't label with my MtGox account number.   
Has anyone else "lost" their funds in this way?   
I'd understand if there was no proof, but with receipts and dates and values all provided it is infuriating to be told "look in your wallet" or "this transfer has already been completed" by MtGox Support - especially for such a simple task: match deposit date and amount with any deposits accepted without corresponding MtGox account number details in comment field.   
Any feedback appreciated as I'm not sure how I can justify putting my next $1000 of BitCoins through MtGox when a small $100ish deposit seems impossible to fix. Someone reassure me please :/   
Given that the "lost" funds are accepted by technocash without a reference number, it should be easy to simply refund any incoming funds without corresponding reference details. It shouldn't be so difficult when a customer can produce proof of deposit etc just to get a refund minus fees.  
I'm more annoyed that it's one month since support was notified and the best support could offer was "the $140 was deposited on day X" when it's just one of the other $140 deposits I made successfully.  
I've started using localbitcoins.com and mtgox really should take note because a lot of business will bleed out if others have to jump through hoops like I did in order to chase funds mislabeled thru no fault of my own.  
**Btw, end result? Still no word of refund or any outcome whatsoever. Unprofessional in my opinion.  **

I know the guy who posted the 4th link ever about changetip. He's cool though. Doesn't let it go to his head. He's always happy to get tattoos or suck cock to get publicity though; it's always a great marketing tool to have a D list celebrity get a tattoo of your brand because the exposure pays for itself. Though not as well as sucking dick.

This bearwhale talk...how long is it going to go on for?
The reason it bothers me is because of one very simple thing; if you believe this bearwhale can control the price through his huge buying power then it's implying nothing anyone does here or any other small investor does matters. 
Also, assuming this "bearwhale" lost money is excluding it's the most likely situation; that someone was liquidating large amounts of coins in a cash out scam (and one happened last week, coincidentally!). So if the loss is $2.7 million from a $30 million gross take, they're slightly less rich.

If only computers were in some form of kiosk or could be used with cell phones or even at libraries.... Until then they'll keep using BTC via standard steam powered networks of telegraph poles.

@_date: 2014-10-08 18:25:56


It's the other way around. You can't have Bitcoin without the Blockchain. The Blockchain doesn't need Bitcoin though it is secured with Bitcoin incentives (ie mining). Also, you can certainly have blockchains without Bitcoin. All poodles are dogs but not all dogs are poodles.
The Blockchain is the technological advancement here that is going to be employed in every way, shape and form that corporate entities can profit from. If corporate interests offer better, more predictable mining rewards than BTC for example, BTC will lose miners (and the security will decrease). Miners aren't loyal to BTC on the whole, it's a business decision (otherwise they'd keep their BTC).
Anyhow, it's not to say BTC is doomed, but to go up against corporate interest with a handful of disparate developers defending Bitcoin it'll be a tough fight. Anyone believing they'll get rich from stratospheric increases in BTC in the near future will be sorely disappointed. Blockchain.info themselves concede it'll be &gt;10 years til mass adoption. I think we'll see the signs of which way it's headed soon, but BTC is still in its infancy.

OF COURSE BITCOIN WILL BE MADE ILLEGAL!
OP seems to think the US govt plays fair. Those in power will always strive to keep themselves in power. Bitcoin is a serious threat to financial bodies and those in power. It will blow back the more btc gains popularity. 
The War On drugs makes no sense but if reddit were around decades ago nobody in their right mind would've believed the war on drugs was possible without protesters getting up in arms at a bill being passed and stopping it. They'd reason alcohol prohibition was a bust so no govt would ever try to make drugs illegal again. 
As with Bitcoin we'd like to believe we live in a democracy but we don't. The hands of bitcoins are in those who stand to lose billions even trillions of dollars to their way of earning. 
Bitcoin will either be made illegal or a loophole will make it unusable (think the Harrison Act of early 20th century. It didn't make marijuana illegal. You needed tax stamps to buy it though and the trick was the govt never made any tax stamps)

You did well,
I've been trying to get my bitcoins credited from a deposit made into the Aussie technocash account and despite every conceivable piece of proof and date and time (ie no thinking required, I've basically done a walk through) it's 10 days later.
It took me 2 minutes to do the same task and upload the transaction screenshot. 
The support are dong their best I'm sure, but who the hell CUTS BACK on support when all this turmoil re bitcoins is happening? The live chat support was great but why on earth would mtgox think "best we shut down support chat so people are waiting for help!".  I'm sure that wait just pushes people to looking at other options because MtGox claims to be fast, safe, secure and The BC Solution; 10 days
of support for a 2 minute job at a site that closes down altogether is aligning too well with any of that phrase.
I'll keep you all posted.
