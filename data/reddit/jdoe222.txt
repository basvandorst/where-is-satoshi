I'd rather them put it out sooner as you can stamp out bugs much quicker in production and the pressure to get it fixed is greater as well.  I'd like to see some small scale implementations to start more rapidly than waiting for perfection.  It will break.  There is no doubt about it but so what.  It will get fixed just like bitcoin has in the past.

I just want a timeline at this point in truth.  Maybe all us bitcoin holders can help speed it along with donations.

I've seen this.  This doesn't really tell you much though unfortunately and the devs just don't seem to talk about it a lot.  Unfortunately because of that it feels a long way off.    Who knows though, maybe they'll start to deploy and have some companies running lightning nodes next week.  At this point, I'm hoping there is a lot of financial incentive to do so.

Honestly that starts sounding like an excuse after a while.  If they need more money, this would be a great place to ask.  I'm sure a lot of us would donate to them.  I could care less about Blockstream one way or the other.  In fact I WISH Blockstream would contribute a ton to it and start the first lightning hub/node--and they should be rewarded greatly for it.   
I really just want it working soon.  I'm certain many other bitcoin holders feel the same way.

Since this is so central to bitcoin's success, shouldn't there be an official sub?  If there is one, what is it?  Thanks

Sounds good.  We definitely need more progress reports on it since it's integral.  I think most have no idea how far off it is.  I know I don't.
