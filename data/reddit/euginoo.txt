Contraire, atms as they are in use today are owned by separate entities. They are placed for convenience in corner shops to facilitate transactions and the store might have no return other than the cash that is spent in the store. 
The BitCoin ATM as I imagine it being laid out might be managed by a separate "non-affiliated" entity which take a commission of the bitcoin exchanges and transfer funds collected from the machine into store owners pocketses.

But if they were wall street they would wash investment funds through a separate Business Entity they have controlling interest in and then deposit it. Its a fucked up world, and if your not one of the fat slobs on wall street you have to find ways around their "rules".

Thats the beauty of it. If you have an ATM you are selling Bitcoins not "illegal" controlled substances. A heavyset gruff dude shows up from the ATM company in his armored truck and then drives your money to the bank!
 Every dispensary should now be looking into the Point of Sale Bitcoin exchange options.

That is why the American Dream has been dreamt. I don't know about the rest of Generation Y but 20/30 somethings today have got to look at this system critically before we invest ourselves reality that is this country's failure to include the middle class and working americans into the prosperity they once believed in. The system is set. The rules have been established and also deregulated by the richest Americans to create the establishment. 
Where are the seeds of the reinvention of a new peer to peer economy, a paradigm that works for everyone and doesn't disproportionally allocate wealth. Or does this horizontalism dissolve the concept of "wealth" just by virtue of having money?
This is the type of conversation I am curious to hear more about in this subreddit about how BitCoin can reinvent the structure of money and how we might collectively prosper from a transfer to a BTC economy.
