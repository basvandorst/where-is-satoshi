Nope, has to be a hard fork.

Use a momentum based weight function with a max step size based on the derivative of %filled block?

I really don't like VoS, they screwed me over with Canadian checks and when I contacted them they basically told me that I was on my own.

So I sold some doge for USD back when they were doing real transactions with the USA.  That went smoothly and a check arrived in the mail for the USD amount.  I soon found out that cashing international checks is quite costly at my bank, so I wanted to cancel the check, trade my USD at VoS to bitcoins, withdrawl my bitcoins into my Coinbase account and have the USD deposited directly into the bank.  VoS told me that I was on my own and that they'd do nothing for me, even though their faq says that they can cancel checks.
On the bright side, I truly learned how powerful an international cryptocurrency that holds no allegiance to any government can be for value transfers.

it's kind of how markets work.

Otherwise they wouldn't be selling their services and would just mine coin themselves

You'd be stupid to try and put a narrative to bitcoin.

But its likely that that wealthy investors will start to sell some apples/bitcoins on exchanges and could have an effect on price.

When you receive bitcoin, it doesn't get "pooled" into a single address, you just keep track that so and so gave you money.  When you spend bitcoin, the inputs to the transaction is enough precious transactions to sum up to your spending amount.  This could be 1 transaction (a 100 dollar bill) or a hundred transactions (sack of pennies).  Including a transaction with 100 inputs takes up roughly 100x the space in a block as the single input transaction, and thus costs 100x in fees.

Hey, now that your investment is worth a significant amount of money, I highly recommend getting a hardware wallet like a Ledger S Nano or a Trezor.

True, but I also believe that their security may be higher than my own.  However, they are also a larger target for hackers.  I don't know, its all sort of a wash.

I really like coinbase and I trust them.  In real life all my cash is at the bank, not in my house.  All my important computer data is backed up on Google drive, not my home NAS (which us mostly media).  In short, I genuinely believe my coins are more safe at coinbase than on my own hardware.  I suppose I could upload an encrypted backup to Google drive, but then I don't trust myself to remember a secure password a few years from now.
@_date: 2015-07-15 21:37:34
I also don't store huge amount of cash in my house in case of theft or fire?
@_date: 2015-07-15 21:14:05
That wasn't my argument?
@_date: 2015-07-04 16:01:48
Nah I'd rather blindly promote bitcoin and see Greece as a miracle.
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:20:12
Except the transaction fees are negligible compared to the Coinbase reward; so this is purely ideological.
@_date: 2015-09-28 22:17:18
That's not the point.
@_date: 2017-05-01 16:06:14
I never exactly liked this mentality.  I don't keep all my cash in my house, I keep it safe in a bank.  I'm willing to bet Coinbase has better security than I.

It's seen as a slippery slope half assed solution to the scaling problem; the leaders of the movement are also generally hated by the community.  Basically people on the main chain want to use segregated witness to solve scaling while bitcoincasb wants to use larger blocks.  Using larger blocks raises the barrier to entry for operating a full node, which in turn centralized bitcoin.

Honestly the difference for an individual is fairly trivial at this stage of the game, downloading and uploading about 8MB every 15 minutes isn't going to wreck anyone.  The two problems are "it's a slippery slope, what prevents 1gb blocks" and "running a node is basically a donation, why make it harder to run a node"

For many it's not the hdd space, but internet bandwidth.

This is like nearly impossible to keep track of (even if you are not malicious!).  I've also been told that crypto to crypto is a "like-kind exchange" which defers the taxable part until you go back to USD.
So like if I traded 1 BTC for $3000 back and forth from day trading cryptos such that eventually I end up with 3BTC, I only get taxed (for the gains of 2BTC, $6000) when I convert back to USD from BTC.

Generally Coinbase and GDAX (which is owned and ran by Coinbase) websites go down under the heavy traffic caused by massive price swings.

I ordered at the same time as you, got it a week later (US).  I've never felt more secure and comforted.  The only thing I wish is that they support my shit altcoins.

Wow! He could have made more money if he knew the exact future price of bitcoin!
