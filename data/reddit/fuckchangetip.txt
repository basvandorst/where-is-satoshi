It's sad to see Bitcoin companies closing.  But maybe they will affect positive change at AirBnb.

Woohoo! Go Bitcoin!  To da moon.  This is gentleman.  Yay!

The wide range of opinions is good for discussion but has yet to lead to a consensus.  This is however, a valuable first step towards an understanding, and an agreement, which will lead to a consensus.

If they bought 1500 bitcoins at 240, which is the price they were trading at on the 22nd, then they would have paid:  $360,000.  If they bought them at 225 today they would have paid:  $337,500.

One of the first things I learned in computing was the importance of redundancy and back ups.  Why should we have only one of something, when alternatives are possible?

Seems like promotion for this Nathaniel Hopper guy's book again.  Who is this Nathaniel Hopper?  How long has he been in the Bitcoin space?  What did he do before? Why should I care/respect what he says?  How did he become an authority on Bitcoin?  I've been seeing his name tossed around as if he is some sort of all knowing expert.

However bad anyone else does it, someone, somewhere will do it right and sell their car to buy 1000 dollar bitcoin.

Oh Canada, your doing such a good job trying to have a wait and see approach to bitcoin.  It's great to see that a government is actually able to listen to the advice of an expert in the field.  Andreas must have had a lasting impression on them, because since he lectured at the Senate, Canada has seemingly adopted the "wait and see" approach.  They see the utility in the network and don't want to be left behind by discouraging businesses to locate there. Cheers!

Free Ross!  I would hope that they would be able to get a new trial or at the very least a reduction in the sentence.  With the amount of new evidence that has come out in this case it is hard to see them denying this appeal.  (I hope.)

Really I think the Block Size Debate Can be summed up by this one [image](

Zero Confirmations on any of the transactions I sent for the last 45 minutes.  I saw the number of unconfirmed transactions hit over 5000 on Blockchain.info.  But then it went back down to 3500 or so.

It's all about getting people used to digital payments and then they will see Bitcoin is the superior form of digital payment.

It is unnecessary to Google search Apple Pay.  It is an app so most people would search for it in the app store not so much online. Furthermore, Apple Pay is strictly a payments platform, while Bitcoin will be so much more.

There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him
You can treat him bad and leave him when he's down
But I'm ready, yes, I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound of the beat

All I hear is "killer app" this and "killer app" that.  This is a community of typically intelligent people.  Do we have to call it a "killer app"?  Can't we come up with something better?

Mmmmm Data, Numbers, and Statistics.  This is the mark of a good experiment.

Good to see these people from legacy institutions getting involved in the future.

Oh man really?!? But it was such a great service with such great potential to make money.  They had such a great business plan and great people worked there.  Oh man.  I'll miss all the changetipbot comments that kept the flow of the conversation in tact.  I don't know what I'll do without the 7 cents I received for the death in the family.  Oh man.  I can't even imagine bitcoin working without changetip.  We'll clearly be feeling the effects of this news for weeks.

You can buy things or send money to anyone anywhere in the world without using a bank or third party.   And that's pretty great.  
It's a digital currency on a decentralized ledger, it's not gonna grow wings and shoot lasers out its' ass.

Sometimes its necessary to collect a fee in order to actually make a profit and be a company.  (Man, life's rough). They still provide a great service and have assisted many, many people in accepting Bitcoin.

Just a reminder as always:  If you don't own your private keys, you don't own your bitcoins.  Never invest more than you can afford to lose.  And don't trust exchanges.  
@_date: 2015-10-22 22:11:02
woohoo tax free exchanges wooooo

Getting to the point of saturation is what we're waiting for.  When Bitcoin is everywhere, people will have to use it.
@_date: 2015-11-05 17:55:51
That's great news.  The more Apple and other companies learn bout it, the more they want to be involved.  I believe that Mobile payment apps (ie ApplePay, googlepay, and whatever else) will pave the way for the ultimate digital cash... Bitcoin.
