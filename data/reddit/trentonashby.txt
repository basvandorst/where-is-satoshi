The problem with spending bitcoins is the sellers convert immediately to fiat. This is bad for the price. It is better if people hold their Bitcoin and don't spend. By gifting bitcoins we get wider acceptance and if the receiver holds the price goes up. Now they might like it at first but they will change their mind in a few years time when their $5 worth of Bitcoin is worth literally millions. We need to gift as many people in secret Santa bitcoins as we can, because they will thank us later

Be playful but not forceful. I tell my wife I want to deposit some bitcoins in her wallet and she gets real horny.

Tipping humans is what we want to do, it's just accidental tipping of sub-humans that needs to be sorted out

It's giving very small amounts of money to increase awareness and force new adoption. As new people get involved the price goes up and everybody literally wins. This is the killer app for bitcoin.

This is blowing my mind. We could build tip dispensers into cars and anyone who gets out of your way gets a tip.

Buy as many coins as you can, then hold them to make the price go up. Now is the best time to buy and even if you have to borrow you will double your money in a few months. Bitcoin is really starting to take off so get in now while it is so cheap

The only downside to tipping is that you don't know anything about the person you are giving money too. So if for example you wouldn't normally give money to a muslim then this could be annoying ( giving money to terrorists who want to kill you ). The tipping infrastructure needs to have a short bio of possible tip receivers and then you can set your preferences not to tip muslims, gays, etc or whatever you don't believe in

You must be the only person in the world who doesn't like getting free money. I'm sure you are trolling. Go away please

That's actually a great incentive because you can make money by just driving around. Imagine having other people pay for your gas! This is a game-changer!
