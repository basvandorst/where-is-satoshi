Well lets see, I studied computer science (essentially a minor) in a top university. Studied Finance/Business as a major. Have worked in an IB at a top firm (not anymore). Have a fairly strong understanding of economics, currencies, inflation, money supply, banking systems, etc. so quite honestly I probably understand more than you.
Yes i get how supply works, and decentralization, and distributed ledgers, and verification. Whats your point? Money isn't worth anything if it can't reliably buy stuff. BTC cant reliably buy stuff. Its that simple. If I have enough for a TV today, I might not tomorrow, or I might have too much the day after.
I'd be all down for a BTC based economy, but you can't flip a switch, and a slow climb is not going to cut it.
@_date: 2019-07-17 15:48:38
It's not about crashes honestly. If it goes up or down 5% annually that's too much. Who can risk that much of their compensation on pure chance?
@_date: 2019-07-18 20:47:24
Do you understand what money is? Value does not equal money. A barter is not the same as a transaction.
This is ridiculous lol why am I talking to people that know nothing
@_date: 2019-07-17 15:47:49
The whole point is it can't hit the standard without having stability first...
@_date: 2019-07-18 03:57:11
But, its not priced in BTC. Even if a shop takes BTC it prices in fiat and just adjusts the BTC price. 
I know what you're trying to say theoretically, but its just not reality. Nothing is actually priced in BTC except for maybe a handful of coffee shops or small desperate businesses
@_date: 2019-07-17 15:57:39
Why do people on here compare so much random unrelated shit? Metal vs stone is very very very different from btc vs fiat. Metal/stone is a commodity material used to produce goods, not a medium of exchange. Nothing in this comment is at all relevant
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:51:49
And you do? Watching YouTube videos is more legitimate than actual education and professional experience? Lmao. The fuck else would indicate knowledge? You guys have your heads so far up your own butts. Keep being delirious
@_date: 2019-07-17 15:46:15
Lol. Have you ever started a company or even looked at a startup? Do you have any idea how difficult it is to grow from infancy?
Tons of great ideas never achieve real sustained growth
@_date: 2019-07-18 21:34:41
What you said was literally my first comment in this chain. Are you retarded? What is even your point?
Metal replaced stone so btc will replace usd? Lmao.
@_date: 2019-07-18 03:55:55
The fuck? Literally none of those were currencies. Maybe paper was a bartering commodity at some point, but that's not money.
@_date: 2018-09-09 17:12:19
Rich people have a lot more money. Losing 2% of a lot more money is much more hurtful than losing 2% of $10 for people living paycheck to paycheck. The dude with a million loses 20k a year. The person with $10 would lose 20 cents if he had that $10 the whole year...
@_date: 2018-09-11 14:14:06
Lol you sound like a communist whiner.
Its debt if you put yourself in debt. It goes to the rich if you spend your money on things that make them rich. Corps are owned by people, that are selfish. How much do you contribute to "civil-society interests"?
And what does any of that have to do with crypto? It would still just go to the few because they own everything you would spend BTC on
@_date: 2018-09-09 17:26:07
You'd be surprised. I bet they hold way more cash than you'd think.
@_date: 2018-09-09 02:01:54
Low reserve banking is good unless there's a bank run. High money supply is GOOD, more business is GOOD. How do you think people get jobs or new advanced phones every year or other improved products. All of our lives would be way worse if business and money supply was choked
@_date: 2018-09-09 17:10:08
Fair enough. Maybe you don't agree with the boosted economy. 
The other thing is, you can still inflate money supply by using bitcoin...you can still have low reserve ratios with bitcoin nothing changes. Just having a finite number of tokens is meaningless. There is finite paper money. More can be created yes, but its always finite.
@_date: 2018-09-11 19:05:11
Again, whining. Labor must be paid less than they contribute? Sure. But what can that labor do on its own? Without the mcdonalds kitchen, supplies, name on the board, POS system, marketing, etc etc, can the laborer sell burgers cooking them himself? No
Labor is paid what the labor is worth. As dictated by the ability and availability of that labor. If there was ANY way for that employee in the McDonalds restaurant to get more for his time he would have taken it. That's not going to change with any crypto. Maybe with an upturn of wealth you change the ultimate owner. The employees? They'll keep working for basically the same.
So dont invest in the stock market? You know its a 0 sum game right? For someone to win, someone has to lose. Theres a buyer and seller for every share, every transaction. Regardless of whether its speculation or whatever, that doesn't change. Its not a magic machine for the rich
@_date: 2018-09-09 05:13:51
Lol. Inflation hurts rich people way more than regular "hard-working, honest people"
It also impacts everyone...no one benefits from inflation. Where the fuck do you get these ideas?
@_date: 2018-09-09 17:13:28
Don't get me wrong. Crypto has applications, especially for cross border transactions and maybe for lower cost transfers. But that doesn't make fiat as bad as people on here say.
@_date: 2018-09-11 14:10:10
This one's not. Ive mostly only pointed out from the very peaks though
@_date: 2018-09-09 17:07:08
Or you could just not buy the home? Because the bank did that most americans can buy a home. If the banks werent around to do that, how many americans do you think would be able to buy a home? Probably the 1% of the rich, definitely not the people with regular jobs
@_date: 2018-09-09 17:15:57
The ignorance is astounding. Such strong opinions with such little understanding of how money, the economy, or business works.
@_date: 2018-09-11 17:34:09
LOL. So just hold the USD, who told you to deposit it in a bank? Sounds you're just hoping for a reset button. It goes to the ownership class because, well, they built it and took on risk and put in effort. I own nothing but I can appreciate that. McDonalds didnt pop up out of nowhere. Someone built it up through hardwork. Why are you just expecting to be handed down stuff by hitting this reset button?
Crypto doesn't stop fractional reserve banking. Its the same exact shit. If it takes off to any extent there will be Bitcoin banks offering interest rates and security. Hold your BTC in a bank that pays you interest and guarantees security? Who wouldn't do that. They can then just hold on to 10% of the BTC and then lend out the rest like fiat.
Inflation is GOOD. Do you know what happens to deflationary economies? They go bust. You would literally have to hold it at exactly par for it to be beneficial. If anyone even expects deflation, which pretty much everyone on this forum does, the economy would be fucked
Do you know anything about how the economy works? I bet you've basically just read a few biased articles on some random shitty news website / blog explaining a couple things like fractional banking and now think you're the expert behind a "just cause". Crypto has advantages yes, in international transactions and things like that. Fractional banking? No. Getting rid of inflation? God I hope not.
@_date: 2018-05-17 13:42:48
Lol. Or im curious and want to know even if I don't do anything with it? The eggs point is dumb, the amount of $s i spent on eggs is immaterial and it is obviously not volatile, unlike BTC.
Its honestly to not have it. Are you all so scared of seeing the value?
@_date: 2018-09-10 16:29:55
All the times the S&amp;P has hit ATHs...

It's not sustainable. The app is going to charge a fee. Who is going to pay it? Maybe some btc enthusiasts won't mind but most would rather use a CC. Get their CC points AND pay less.
Sbx sure as fuck will NOT be paying the fee. 
The app? Sure it can do that for some time. Eventually it'll run out of money. Look at tilt
@_date: 2018-08-04 16:55:09
Lol this is dumb. If that's your goal buy assets. Won't matter what currency anyone's using it'll be worth what it is.
A stock or a house will be worth what it's worth regardless of how many dollars a btc is.
You're either just lying to yourself or karma whoring
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:18:25
If an "average joe" is making one investment it is in bitcoin. Not sure why, but people that don't know anything about finance seem to more comfortable with bitcoin than stocks
@_date: 2018-05-22 20:32:10
No, this would work the exact same as fiat money supply. The fiat money supply is way larger than the actual amount of currency out there. Could do the same with Bitcoin.
I.e. Bank \(coinbase\) gives out actual currency \(Bitcoin\) as a loan, but still guarantees the depositor will be able to withdraw / spend as much currency \(Bitcoin\) as he/she deposited.
There just wont be a way to print Bitcoin to inject liquidity into the economy if needed. The rest could work like regular fiat systems.

You don't have to buy bitcoin to "be in it for the tech"
@_date: 2018-05-23 00:08:03
Lol. So you want to shutdown 90% of the economy? Never want a mortgage? Don't want to be able to use credit cards? Always want to pay for your car 100% up front?

Pay attention to the link. Those lines are also connected at precise mathematical angles, except those ones actually connect and look a whole lot nicer :)
@_date: 2018-08-04 17:04:27
Markets run on EXPECTATIONS. When the price shot up from $200 to $7k or whatever, people were already expecting adoption. They're already paying for it. This stuff is just confirmation for what was expected. 
Prices go up when you beat the EXPECTATION of the market
@_date: 2018-05-15 16:03:56
Thats kinda sad
@_date: 2018-05-18 15:48:23
Prices are determined by EXPECTATIONS. The hashrate going up isnt surprising. Everyone knew it was going to happen from day 1. Everyone has already priced in that information. If the hashrate goes up more than expected, then the price would go up.

Lmao. Everyone acting like Warren is acting for self preservation. Firstly, he'll be dead in a few years and he knows it. Bitcoin won't take over nearly fast enough to affect him AT ALL. Secondly, he doesn't hold fiat. He holds COMPANIES. If Bitcoin does take over, he'll just sell his companies for Bitcoin....
Literally does not matter to him wealth wise. Just his opinion
@_date: 2018-05-16 14:58:50
Lol. People need to understand how markets work. These conventions? everyone knew there was going to be one MONTHS ago. What does that mean? All the positivity tied to this stuff was built in months ago. Everyone that cared already bought bitcoin. The actual thing happening has no impact because everyone already expected it
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:13:19

@_date: 2018-05-23 14:13:42
What new investors. Everyone I know that knows how to use a computer has already considered buying BTC over the last 6\-8 months
@_date: 2018-05-22 22:43:24
I dont think you understand how banking works. They don't sell fiat. They dont print it. They take it from person A and give it to person B. Then usually take it back from person B and give it to person C. Because of the credit in their account, all three of those people can use the same actual $1 bill. 
If BTC can't be used for lending in this way it is pretty much useless as a currency
@_date: 2018-05-09 17:33:06
Yes, put in all your savings. Going to the moon. You can 10x your house in no time
@_date: 2018-05-25 15:29:17
This is the equivalent of putting your cash under your mattress, sure you can do it, but its not very useful. 
Banks being able to do this is a GOOD thing. How do you think people get mortgages and car loans. Without this kind of effect no one would be able to buy homes, More than half the economy would die
@_date: 2018-05-23 01:25:42
Yes thats what I was trying to say, without complicating it. You can do the same thing with bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-20 02:46:59
Lol. You're an idiot. The govt prints money, not the banks.
And you're trying to say no one will buy Coke in the future with BTC because it will be legacy? LMAO. What WILL you buy with bitcoin? A virtual juice bag of douchebaggery?
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:16:12
Hm, I don't really see people over 40 buying crypto ever. Maybe the type of penetration you're talking about will happen in 50 years. I have a tough time seeing anyone in rural areas trying to buy bread or milk with bitcoin but who knows
@_date: 2018-05-17 14:18:35
I wouldn't mind a BTC to Eggs ticker instead of BTC to USD
@_date: 2018-05-16 20:27:58

@_date: 2019-03-14 15:12:11
I wouldn't mind if posts were talking about applications in China or w/e. Or even talking about different countries. Venezuela over and over? Makes me wonder how much relevance there is in other places.
Good for the Venezuelan that does that. But how much is that Venezuelan still taking out? $1K? $10K? The volume is a joke.
@_date: 2019-03-18 18:48:15
So now the fees are inflation? Dude you're wack
@_date: 2019-03-14 14:20:45
Lmao exactly. They don't even have power. That country is at a point where money is irrelevant. It doesn't matter whether its in fiat or BTC.
If developed countries ever hit that point it won't be a matter of who has what money. It'll be a matter of who can grab food and survive in an unorganized, chaotic system. Good luck trying to trade BTC for food when people are starving and killing each other.
@_date: 2019-03-17 19:44:29
Infinite actually. Haven't paid a fiat atm fee in a decade
@_date: 2019-03-19 13:51:45
At this point this sub just feels like a bunch of scammers wanting you to buy in no matter. Everything is somehow good for bitcoin.
This tweet is dumb as shit. Yeah the network was running internationally, but no one in Venezuela was able to access it...so what is the point?
@_date: 2019-03-14 18:58:44
Haha. Yeah im curious how much people on here even have. I've seen so many posts of straight depressed people after the crash. Then you read the comments and figure they had a total $500 invested
@_date: 2019-03-14 23:25:30
Sigh. You clearly don't understand how the monetary system works
@_date: 2019-03-14 19:28:51
Probably. Im negative :)
I have nothing to add because literally everything you have said i dead wrong.
You can't have infinite credit because their are reserve policies which restrict the number of times you can lend something out.
It doesn't matter if its backed by a hard asset or not, you can lend anyways. The only requirement for the process is for everyone that has deposited fiat/BTC/other assets does not want them all back at once
Fiat does not have a 100% failure, in fact it seems to be working in well in the vast majority of countries, except maybe venezuela. Their problem is economic, not monetary (not sure you even know the difference)
The ponzi scam comparison is fully non-sensible. Banks / other orgs give OUT debt. I.e. they give OUT money. On the promise that the money will be paid back. Its literally the opposite of a ponzi scam. If you're so enraged by fractional reserve banking, don't get a mortgage, don't buy a car on credit, don't use credit cards.
@_date: 2019-03-14 14:54:56
Every two days: "People in Ven don't have food or heating or power, but that BTC eh? They have a new ATM"

How much is your investment portfolio
@_date: 2019-03-14 15:15:53
If by recently you mean almost a decade, sure. This is not a surprise. Venezuelen money has been worthless for years and years.
@_date: 2019-03-14 14:58:29
Ah Chile, an economy even smaller than Venezuela...
@_date: 2019-03-15 13:59:07
Not really lol. Why would I? 
@_date: 2019-03-14 15:47:15
Ah no doubt, really want to hike through Patagonia over the next few years.
No I get that point. Personally I believe international money transfer is BTC's biggest advantage, and honestly i would love to use it for that. Unfortunately, the value is way too volatile for that to be functional for any developed economy. Its easier and cheaper (right now at least) for anyone in NA, Europe, India, China, etc. to eat the 2.5% conversion fee but get a guaranteed rate vs pay fiat to BTC exchange fees and then be subject to price variation during transfers.
People will downvote all of my comments here because this sub is mostly fanatics that don't understand much about the economy, but the simple fact is that BTC will not become mainstream on the back of benefits it provides to the poor or to the developing economies. It'll be mainstream only if it provides value to the major economies.
@_date: 2019-03-14 17:21:15
Lol wtf is this. Inflation is an outcome, not an input
@_date: 2019-03-15 01:52:07
For suggesting the fed is a problem blindly.
And yes, even that level of inflation is impossible in the U. S. Without a catastrophic economic failure. There really is no middle ground because unless there is a failure the fed just raises interest rates and things cool down. If there's a failure you can't stop it
@_date: 2019-03-14 15:00:58
Sure. Its cold. But do you live in Venezuela? Does it impact you? Are YOU doing anything for these people???
And there is a lot more wrong with venezuela than a failing monetary system. The root cause is their economic engine just doesn't run anymore. They can't produce/obtain enough goods so the goods are worth more than money. ANY money. People would rather have food or water or power than money, regardless of whether its fiat or crypto.
@_date: 2019-03-14 19:20:03
You keep keeping on buddy. I wish you and your $500 net worth well.

Every heard of a car with which you can drive to a bank / vault and get cash?
Ever heard of paper debit and credit card transaction processing? Idiots on here acting like there was no banking before the year 2000.
Seriously, are you guys fucked? I'm going to set up a generator and satellite connection so I can pay for breakfast? 95% of Americans wouldn't be able to set up their own internet router let alone a satellite connection
@_date: 2019-03-14 22:32:04
You know the fed exists right? It's reasonably easy to control inflation unless your entire economy relies on oil like Venezuela. They are completely incomparable
@_date: 2019-03-14 14:57:35
I mean they could also have converted their currency to literally any other fiat currency and the outcome would have been fine. Not that it matters. The main point is there was no wealth. Its not like venezuela was thriving before this. A few people might have wealth, but for the masses? No money to convert and save
@_date: 2019-03-18 01:05:18
Are you retarded? Where the fuck is misura. I live in Canada. Nothing you said makes sense. 
You're telling me buying bitcoin for 5% more than its worth is better than a $2-3 free? That's so fucking stupid lmao

It doesn't even add to the market cap ffs. Trading is a 0 sum gain, it just changes the owner unless its enough to move the price. 10K is not enough to move the price.

If this is all it takes to cause FUD you must not be very confident

Lol you seem a little upset
@_date: 2018-10-30 14:49:01
Well mine costs me $120 a year, but I get about $500 in rewards for the year without trying. I don't really care who runs them or tracks how much I spend on McDs, thats still almost $400 FREE for me...
Interesting point on the cheaper thing. Wonder if that would flow through to customers. Could say that would apply fiat cash the same way vs credit
@_date: 2018-10-25 02:51:59
Literally no one is thinking "The S&amp;P is so volatile it fell 3% I should put my money in Bitcoin for safety"

I'm not promoting anyone. You mentioned visa, which btw is not a bank. "Slave" is a bit excessive either way.
And if converting to crypto and paying bills with that is somehow more profitable than get 2-5% back from the credit company, please let me know how because I'm always interesting in making more.
@_date: 2018-10-30 15:30:21

@_date: 2019-10-03 19:46:09
Simple google: "how many people have heard of bitcoin"
6 in 10 americans had heard of it in 2018. My cab drivers talk about bitcoin. Its delusional to think that most people at this point have not heard of bitcoin.
The rest doesn't matter as much. Most americans don't understand how fiat works. What it means for it to be a medium of exchange, how inflation works, etc. Most of this sub doesn't even really understand how QE or "printing money" works and impacts our economy / money system.
Anyways, the point is about the halving. The general population isn't going to be miraculously educated because of the halving. So the short term impact of the halving is zilch even if what you say is true long term
@_date: 2019-10-02 20:30:54
So you can't think of a single practical reason? Nice

Inflation is good for EVERYONE. No inflation, no consumption, no economic progress, no jobs.
@_date: 2019-10-02 18:01:41
Exactly lmao. You also have a bank password and literally physically have any cash you might have. People really think if government can take your cash they won't be able to take your crypto?

Uh. Fewer miners mine. Their individual rewards go up to slightly profitable again. No price change.
@_date: 2019-10-03 19:49:36
\^ also, there is no real demand. The demand is spurred by speculation. Right now there is higher '"demand" because people expect there to be a halving, and are buying in advance. When it happens, supply drops, but so does demand

Yeah these are so stupid. At least in Canada there are banks where you can sign up online, they PAY YOU interest, have free transfers, no monthly fees and no transaction fees. My bank has literally given me infinitely more money than it has taken from me.
Now someone here is going to call me a sheep for some dumbass reason because I chose to take free money from the bank and make my life easier. 
@_date: 2019-10-04 01:55:06
Sounds like all of you is within your arse

So you want no one to own a home? I see. Because what you're saying would mean the vast majority of people will never be able to own homes
@_date: 2019-12-17 20:58:27
You don't understand economics. No one on this sub talking about "fractional banking" does. That would directly cut money supply, the gdp, and all economic output. There would be no homes built. How do you think contractors get funding for construction? 
About 50%? Try again, you would cut money supply way way way more drastically than that. Most people would straight up be on the street, there would be 50%+ unemployment etc

Honestly, I'm not some altruist angel. I mostly care about me, and a handful full of people I'm close to. Certainly anyone I know has not been hurt by the "bank".
Maybe someone didn't get approved for a loan worst case. Whoopdeedo they didn't get money to spend they never had because they couldn't prove they could pay it back. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:36:52
Lmao. Do you seriously call them banksters? Ahahaha. I can't tell if you're serious or just trolling.
But yeah you know WW2 was obviously caused by the bankers as was all the conflict in Rwanda. Or even the conflict in the Middle East.
Do you have any education at all?

@_date: 2018-11-20 18:30:58
Eh. I'm willing to bet products people use will continue to get better (iPhones, clothing, food, movies, w/e) and the economy will chug along. Money is just a medium for exchange. Whether it'll be exchanged in USD or btc in the future doesn't really matter. McDonalds will still be selling burgers, people will still be paying rent, and banks will still be offering mortgages to people who don't have enough cash to buy a house outright (aka most people) 
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:20:38
To recover you essentially need one of two things, or a bit of both. The same people putting in more money, or new people putting in new money. Its worked so far because there have been a lot of new people coming in every cycle. This time could be the same, but BTC awareness is pretty high now. Most people after the 2017 peak have heard about bitcoin and have probably considered buying it at some point, and then decided not to. Might be harder to find those new people to drive the price up
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:12:23
Very few? 
@_date: 2018-11-20 07:09:30
Lol. You're a joke. You know ALL supply is available for trade right? Not just new supply?

@_date: 2018-11-20 15:38:12
That doesn't make sense. You can just buy stuff with Bitcoin and then buy more Bitcoin.  Like if I have $10 fiat and $10 in BTC, I can just spend the BTC on pizza and then buy $10 of BTC with my fiat instead of spending $10 fiat on pizza. 
Obviously its just easier to pay for the pizza in fiat, which I guess is the point.

Uh. He/she is literally talking about smuggling money through customs. Sure it's not drugs but if it's not allowed by customs smuggling is smuggling. Also clearly talking about tax evasion and hiding assets from the government. So yeah, criminal activity. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:12:17
Well its you vs them right? If you believe BTC will replace all fiat, then either you win or no-coiners win. So kinda makes sense for them to be around.
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:06:40
Lol nice. Gamble money on bitcoin when you're 80k in debt
@_date: 2018-11-20 04:02:03
LOL you're dumb as a bat. Halving doesnt REDUCE supply, it just slows the rate of an increase. If you're being technical you first need demand to be increasing at least as much as the bitcoin supply for the price to be maintained. So literally all that means is that in addition to the demand I mentioned, there needs to be some additional demand to counteract the increase in supply (even if its slowing, the number Bitcoins out there never goes down)
Biggest problem with this sub is its full of people that think they're experts, but literally don't know shit

Lmao. Everyone here loves to cite ridiculous use cases for bitcoin as to why fiat sucks. How many Americans are trying to run servers in India? Sure its great for the few thousand that are, but the vast millions just wanna buy groceries, pay for movie tickets, sign up for a pornhub accounts. Easy enough with fiat
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:21:36
Lol what. Wheels? Electricity? Penicillin? Telephones? 
@_date: 2019-01-14 20:02:24
Sure so maybe it's valuable to you, but let's not pretend it changes the life of millions. People want food and housing and drinks at bars. Whether they buy those in fiat or btc is all the same.
Companies will always tell you what you can spend on. You can't buy something that doesn't exist. If it exists, there's a company selling it.
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:35:44

@_date: 2018-03-01 15:07:01
I don't get these arguments, you just get paid more so it all works out anyways. If it hadn't lost that value everyone would be making about 97% less as well.

@_date: 2018-02-01 21:05:00
Lol its ridiculous how easy people here think it is to manipulate markets. It takes BILLIONS of dollars in COLLUSION to accomplish that without any other institutions finding out. With BTC's market cap this type of manipulation is almost impossible

@_date: 2019-09-30 15:22:02
Simplified to the point its meaningless
* They can't just take your money, insured deposits are still protected, the people with amounts larger than that are the ones at risk
* If they take the money, they typically give you bank stock, not equivalent but its not a 100% loss
* Banks don't "choose" to get a bailout; it only happens if they're going to go bankrupt
   * Typically, the people that have deposits at these banks are the same ones that have the loans that they cant pay backs
* You shouldn't be storing &gt;$100k cash in a bank anyways, if its its invested in securities (stocks, etc.) they can't just take it away; especially if its invested through a different brokerage

What does that have to do with inflation? I'm sure you're only buying original 100% natural products huh. Sustainably sourced without harming animals? Stuff is made cheap in other countries because that's all bums like you can afford

I know what I can purchase with crypto. 2 apples instead of the 10 I could have bought earlier this year
@_date: 2018-12-14 04:32:30
So then you're trying to decouple crypto from the entire world, that doesn't work. Basic basic postulation of money - a medium for exchange. Forget fiat, it doesn't matter. There is NOTHING that I can buy with 1btc today that cost 1btc earlier this year. You're trying to say what if we pressed the reset button. That will NEVER happen because we already have a currency. There is no reset. There is only potential replacement
I guess if you want you could try to create a community somewhere, but it really won't be much more than a group of hippies at this point. And if you wait till bitcoin is accepted enough for that to not be insane then it would be pointless anyways
@_date: 2018-12-06 06:44:03
Lmao. I understand economy better than you ever will kiddo
@_date: 2018-12-06 06:02:19
LOL. Honestly biggest problem in 2008 was idiots like you buying homes they couldn't afford. The banks shouldn't have made the mortgage, but this is basically comparable to drinking bad milk from a vendor willingly even though you're lactose intolerant.
Do something with yourself instead of blaming others
@_date: 2018-12-06 06:40:08
For an asset that generates value or has a return. Bitcoin earns no money. It'll only ever be worth what people collectively think it's worth.
