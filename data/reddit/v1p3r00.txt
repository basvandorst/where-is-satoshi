I always give to charity because I was a dick when I was young, I only cared about myself, always struggled with anxiety always feared to go among people. But this place changed how I see the world very differently,I heard stories what I couldn't even imagine before. That was the first time I saw children who come from the street, some of them when they got food they eaten until they were sick if the "father" won't say it's enought, because before they got there they starved. It's awful to see that can be happen in this century.

An orphanage in Romania, I used to go to volunteer every summer, and when the bitcoin rises a lot I send them a little amount of money. They have bank account too, but I said them to register a wallet since it has lower fees. They have a lot of clothes, but they have a lot of expense for dry food, washing powder and things that are run out. Here's their facebook   And here's the adress (To the description write: "charity"): 16qQy9CrCkkS4JratJk4iJDPTncQVHhNyS

Yes, sure it is. Did you read the newspaper? They say it is, it makes it true. Media isn't controlled by the politics, and politics isn't controlled by the banks. That's bullsh*t. The banks don't give a damn about you paying those incredibly high fees or don't. You can put money in bank for a year and they give you a whole percent, what because of the inflation more like 0. Sounds right? Some nerds can't reinvent the money. That's impossible. Like that nerd who wanted computers in your house, because Ken Olsen (CEO of IBM,1977) said "There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home.". There's always barriers in the way of frontiers, but nothing is impossible if enought people believe in something.
