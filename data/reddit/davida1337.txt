This is yet another reason to step back and reconsider LN. Not add additional kludge to Bitcoin.

Where does ETH has a block size cap ?

Indeed, so you agree that lightning is not THE solution then.


Nobody is a strong word, I have seen loads of people advocating that Lightning will solve scaling.


There is also an easy solution, increase the block size. After all this is one of the solutions. "Nobody suggested there was a single solution." Remember?


You know what fallacy means? Reality is simple, lightning is not working.

Lightning is not the solution to scaling...

Is that it ? Just an assumption? You ready to bet some money with your claim?


I see, I thought we can have decent discussion but I guess you prefer not to, it is fine by me. Good bye.

Increase the block size.

Good to know, good bye.

Lightning can't work with the current blocksize to support the "entire world finances".
A larger size than a 1mb, which is absurd at this stage.
