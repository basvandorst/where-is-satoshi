I didn't really understand many of the replies in this thread hence I have rarely ever used local wallets so I replied for more responses so I could understand :) Thank you. Why do you recommend waiting for it to download over importing my wallet into electrum? Is there specific reasons or is it just preference? Thank you.

I'm sorry guys I don't understand. So, I won't be able to access my 2 BTC that I have sent to my Bitcoin core wallet until the entire blockchain file is downloaded? Because the BTC has been sent 6 hours ago and it still hasn't shown in my wallet? :\
EDIT: Just so everyone is aware, I sent the BTC was sent before I created this thread. 
So far it says 'Synchronising with network 3 years and 20 weeks behind'. What should I do?
Help please :)
EDIT Would this work?  
Even though my coins aren't showing in my Bitcoin core wallet (balance 0.0000)

Is there any way to transfer my wallet coins from Bitcoin core to another wallet by exporting the coins somehow? I don't have the time to wait until the entire blockchain is downloaded.
Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you.

Alright thanks mate, I guess I'm just gonna have to wait it out. Fuck my 9Mbps down internet connection

Hi mate, I think you misunderstand. Before this thread was created the BTC had already been sent to the receiving address of my Bitcoin core wallet, it has like 50 confirmations in the block chain yet there is 0.0000 BTC in my bitcoin core wallet. Considering I am 3 years and 15 weeks behind in the block chain and there is 2 BTC in limbo I am a little worried. What is my best plan on action?
I can't transfer any bitcoin from my bitcoin core wallet because the balance is zero.
I have been using BTC for about 3 years now but I recently switched wallets (today) and I transferred some BTC over before I created this thread now it seems as though this BTC is held ransom until the entire blockchain is downloaded.
Thanks in advance.
