Wait, did you say buy Bitcoin? Lmao, isn't it at like 15000 or something ridiculous right now for just 1 bitcoin? I don't have that kind of money. Or did you mean Bitcoin Cash?

I said in my OP that I know I'm not going to make billions

No need to get angry. I was just curious. I'm new to all of this and I think it's fair to have an understanding of how it all works before I get invested in it. Even just 100 is a lot of money for me right now.

That sounds expensive 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:08:31
I see your point
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:52:00
Ohhhh. Okay yeah see I'm dumb when it comes to this stuff. I wouldn't even know where to do that though. Suggestions? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:47:02
Okay thanks

Where did I ever say I want to get super rich? I just want to understand it and maybe invest some money that will grow later on.

Yeah I just signed up for Coinbase. Seems pretty easy to use.

I'm sorry but what are all these things? What is an ASICs, how expensive are they and what is vertcoin Bitcoin Gold? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:00:33
Awesome thanks. And not to poke holes or anything but if I'm just your normal person who can't really invest that much at a time, isn't $1, $10, $20 or even $100 not really going to make that much of a difference if that's what I invest since the price of Bitcoin is so high?

True but isn't that still such a small amount or am I missing something?
