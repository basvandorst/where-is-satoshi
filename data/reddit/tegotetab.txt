I assume the transaction fee would change if Bitcoin were operating at higher values. What about if/when .0001 BTC is $1? or $10? That would sort of defeat one of the biggest advantages of Bitcoin.

I agree, and cost averaging has been my overall approach as well. But there are still a great many people that don't see the potential of Crypto currency, and would basically invest in it on a whim because the price seems low. It's a wrong way of looking at it, but still the approach the majority of people I talk to tend to take.

Anyone who says they think Bitcoin will reach $X, is purely speculating. We don't know. Could reach 100k, could fall to $0. It's sort of unprecedented in history, so we just have to watch.
I will say, though, that those that say it has no "intrinsic value" are either blind, or lying. The ability to send money from one end of the world to the other in moments for almost no extra cost is groundbreaking as a protocol for money exchange. That alone makes it valuable, it just needs to get stable enough people to want to use it as a regular medium of exchange. However, I don't think it will reach this stability until it is operating at the higher values at which it was designed to operate.
As for the monopoly money statement, I bought PPC at very small fractions of a Bitcoin and that was half the fun! It makes you feel like you might one day be as lucky as that Norwegian bastard!

It illustrates the difference between inflationary and deflationary currency fairly well now that I think about it.

I wish I only had ~$16,000 in student loans :(

Who's to say that in 10-20 years it won't be the other way around? :)

Hm... Maybe. It would sort of be like receiving your paycheck in cents, only there is a threshold at which the Satoshi will be more efficient at communicating transactions. For example, right now a $4 beer at a bar is .006667 BTC, or 666,700 Satoshis. They are both sort of awkward for every day exchange, but I would say BTC makes more sense still.
However, say in some fantasy world BTC is $1M/coin. Now the price for the $4 beer is .000004 BTC, or 400 Satoshi. To me, 400 makes a lot more sense. It's kind of like buying beer in Yen at that point.
