Bitcoin will not forget when you tried to strangle it as an infant.

Isn't is possible that banning bitcoin in China would create more demand (i.e. prohibition) for those that are already hooked?  Forcing them to just be more creative in their purchase and trading?  Or is the amount of potential average Joe bitcoin users lost so high that it warrants long term decrease in value?  I know it's more speculation and I probably just answered my own question, but hey.  I don't see how bitcoin is stoppable as a movement long term.

I pulled my measly 30Gh out of ghash.io a few days ago to help the cause.  Wading around in small pools now, but haven't seen a payout yet.  (tho honestly I am not sure exactly what the payout threshold is - TL;DR - I am just going to give it a week and hope to see some micro btc trickle in one day soon).  ghash.io did have a decent interface to monitor the mining.  Right now I am just on faith that this loud fan next to me is generating some BTC until i see something come in.  I had my boss sold on mining initially - until we looked at the math some more and realized mining was just going to continue to pay less and less... so we tried cex.io and had a lot of Gh in there when it was ridiculously expensive... saw it start to plummet and pulled out to minimize loss pretty early.  Glad we did.  If i had held and waited, i'd be fired now and we would have lost like 30BTC.  So mining now is just something i leave running to hopefully one day recoup the cost for this unit.  Still, bullish on BTC in general tho.

Isn't it just for hotels on expedia?  Use cheap air for btc flights I think...

same here.  Prices aren't moving.  Also their news feed is filling with spam.
