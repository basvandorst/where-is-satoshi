mbit paper wallets, make them look like payslips. Like having a 'redeem your wage here: privatekey', They can file them away or sweep them when they get them.

Protip: Dont try and 'trade'. You will lose unless you're a whale dumping enough to rock the chart and buy back when the multiple btc you sell at once knock the whole thing down a peg.

Also CB + Rev here, why are you using eur? CB accept £ now, so you can just send the money to CB from Rev as bank transfer (under payments) then it always hits your CB GBP wallet in about an hour or less. You cant move the £/coins from CB for 5 days after this but thats a pretty good HODL guard IMO.
Also sold plenty of BTC on CB and withdrawn to my Rev account, used the card to grab the cash from atm, never any problems with either. If people cant stomach losing a single quid in setting up the accounts for transfer back and forth, they probably aint going to love the fees for buying every single time either. (Moving to CBpro solves most of this, but you will **always** buy at a slight loss regardless of exchange.)

As much as everyone will tell you that keeping your coins on an exchange is a bad idea, and generally (especially if you're in poland right now like wtf) it is, but coinbase is probably the safest of all of them, with your coins being insured to their dollar value at the time of loss if the loss is **NOT** your fault (ie; exchange hack, system fuck up on their end)  
Are you more likely to lose your coinbase login info, or a random key / app / wallet you've grabbed from the handfuls suggested by reddit users, none of which you are familiar with or are as widely used as coinbase.  
Long story short, dont keep your crypto on an exhange, but if you dont know enough about wallets and fees to up and move your shit right away, its best and actually safer to leave them on the exchange for now.  
Coinbase is probably the only exclusion. I'm not saying they WONT run away with the coins, eventually, i'm just saying of all the kids in class theyre the least likely to do it.

So let it tumble, you're not going to sell even if it hits 20k tonight. HODL.
