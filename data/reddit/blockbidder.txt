just curious, did you enter your purchase denominated in USD or BTC (you can change the unit by clicking on the green USD/BTC button)? If you entered "3 BTC" then you should definitely receive 3 BTC in your account; I've done this many times and can verify there is no fee.

btw you generally get a much better rate when selling through circle
@_date: 2014-12-19 11:14:58
so start opening your circle account now then?
the 1-2% hit that coinbase charges (or more depending on how much you buy at once) really adds up if you're doing this with your whole paycheck

circle is a consumer platform not a merchant processor
@_date: 2014-09-03 21:54:37
up to $500 of your credit card purchase is instantly accessible, and you can immediately move it out of circle via an on-blockchain transaction

yeah, this is the most plausible

can you give us more details on what happened? was the loss your fault or bc.i's?
@_date: 2014-12-13 15:55:35
coinbase, circle, xapo. Take your pick
@_date: 2014-12-15 21:19:36
this is true, but only in the sense that "bam, bank of america could take all my USDs at any moment"
@_date: 2014-09-03 19:12:24
there shouldn't be a fee for deposits. the difference is probably coming from fluctuation in BTC/USD rate. did you receive the same amount of BTC in your Circle account that you sent?
@_date: 2014-10-14 00:26:04
some people also say they receive more than they put in sometimes. but the real reason is that you are entering a USD amount to buy or sell, and in the background the exchange rate is fluctuating.
if you want to buy or sell an exact BTC amount, you can toggle the unit currency (the green button that says "USD") from USD to BTC.

i guess the one thing to remember is it's still a beta product. i would think all those features are in the works
@_date: 2014-12-15 21:17:26
you are being misleading. Circle has stated many times that the intent of the insurance is to cover the full value of your account.
@_date: 2014-09-18 21:52:34
agree with you, you can use ACH on Circle with no fee
@_date: 2014-12-15 21:16:15
against security problems or theft, your whole balance is covered. there is no distinction of "hot" and "cold" funds -- only coinbase makes that distinction in their insurance program. from the user agreement: "If Circle’s security measures are compromised, we have you covered up to your full account balance. If someone is able to gain access to your account as a result of a phishing scam, by gaining access to your phone and computer, or otherwise, that is not covered by our insurance."

why does that blog post read like it was written by a high-school freshman trying to sound smart?
also can gaw be any more vague about the "complex mathematical modeling" they used to get to $20?
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:56:09
but isn't it true you can buy and sell at the same rate? that is what zero fees means.
it isn't supposed to mean the exchange rate is always in line with bitstamp or bitfinex or okcoin or whatever other arbitrary market rate you are looking at.
@_date: 2015-02-06 17:21:22
Yeah fuck companies that try their best to bring BTC to the mainstream. Who needs them right?

So don't use your credit card on Circle? Use a debit card or connect your bank account instead.
I don't get the comparison you're trying to make -- are you comparing the exorbitant cash advance fee that YOUR credit card company is charging you to the 1% fee that Coinbase charges for ACH (bank account transfer) purchases? Because that's definitely comparing apples and oranges. 
If you want to be fair, compare Circle's 0% fee ACH purchases to Coinbase's 1% fee ACH purchases.
