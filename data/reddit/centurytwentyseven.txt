The CEO of Bitcoin Suisse has a Bentley with the Bitcoin B instead.

In Switzerland? Lol he’s almost considered poor there.

I just don’t get that the whole argument against big blocks is that it needs slightly more hard drive space (which is readily available) for nodes..  nodes don’t have any economic incentive and thus don’t keep the network secure, right? 
Re fees, people are not using BTC for payments exactly for this reason - the fees are too damn high and it’s hurting real world adoption. 
Moving transactions off chain with beta tech is better then something easy, simple and well understood like increasing the block size? 
I want the whole crypto ecosystem to flourish and due to first mover advantage BTC is going to be the poster child for this ecosystem. When people have a bad experience, like transactions taking a long time, using a convoluted LN or paying extortionate fees, it’s bad for the whole ecosystem. 
You guys can downvote me all you want but bitcoin is supposed to be a decentralised, community driven project. If I don’t agree with the direction it is taking I should be free to do so.

But how else do you lower fees? Why is it inelegant?

Not in Switzerland

And you think this solution is more elegant?

It’s a company in Zug, Switzerland. So this is not a bad business name there.

Why are bigger blocks worse? I have 20TB in hard drive space and 2tb and more is really common?

Is LN a fully developed solution now? Is it ready for mass adoption/use? Is it cheaper in TX fees then large blocks would be? Does this second layer make BTC more robust? Less centralised?

Saxo Bank founder picked up the team, got his Danish friend to sponsor recently. Both live in CH - Saxo guy runs a VC fund, Danish friend runs Bitcoin Suisse.

But at that point other solutions will need to evolve too no? I mean how many transactions can you do with LN?
