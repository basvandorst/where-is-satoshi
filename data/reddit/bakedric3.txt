Thanks for the very well done survey. I'm also doing research about Bitcoin, and writing my Thesis focused on the Business adoption of Bitcoin as well as the User sentiment on spending. You can read more about it here: 
I really love your site, and the depth of you survey, and looking forward to see your upcoming reports.
I believe in the wisdom of crowds, and particularly liked the questions about bitcoin prices in 2014, as well as altcoins. Is there any chance you can share the results of the survey with me?

Fair enough sounds like a good idea.
Thanks that will be great Dr C. Will be awesome to have someone with an interest in Bitcoin help me with my thesis.

I have launched 3 businesses previously, one of which was a service similar to Groupon which has discontinued, and one photo printing app which is ongoing in Singapore.
I am experienced with Social media marketing, and business development. If you would like to discuss the business idea you are currently working on to spin more ideas and lean up the business, drop me a message! Or an email at alvinlee133 =)

No you should not mine. And yes you should buy and hold, if you're thinking of "investing" in that sense. It is possible to purchase up to 8 decimal places of a Bitcoin, i.e. 0.00000001 BTC. The best way now is to send your money into one of the Bitcoin exchanges, depending on where you live.
Which country are you from?
For USA, there's coinbase. For Europe, there's Bitstamp. Elsewhere, and even in those areas, you can use localbitcoins.com which should be the fastest way for you to get your Bitcoins now (But at an average of ~10% premium).
Hope that helps!

But as long as the fiat dollars are still used to purchase most items and services, it matters how much 1 bitcoin is worth in dollars, is it not?

If the person doesn't have background in math/crypto, I suggest skipping the crypto section altogether. Help the other party understand it in THEIR terms, because making it technical will make it sound more boring and even harder to understand. At least I have found that more useful from my own experience.
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:05:29
Yes I think it is. Although the downside is that business owners can easily "exploit" the community's willingness to help out.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:16:15
I agree to some extent. I think the Bitcoin/Litecoin duo will continue to do well with their Gold/Silver branding. While Quark, with 98% already mined, will reach a stable price much quicker than any other Crypto.
However, beware because prices will experience the Keiser Effect, and end up in a few bubbles until adoption reaches its peak. But that will easily take a few years.

I'd advise you to begin by buying some bitcoins on Coinbase or Bitstamp. I personally feel that prices will drop slightly today, but will quickly pick back up. Because China doesn't care about the marketand is wiling to buy up all the bitcoins ;) May be a great time to buy today, once prices dip below 3/400.

You must have also heard about DogeCoin by now; there is also CATcoin which just launched 2-3 days ago and could be promising =)

Me too I have US$6000 stuck in limbo since the 4th of November. And I withdrew 13 BTC yesterday which I have yet to receive for 14 hours and counting, I can't even find the confirmation on the address' blockchain. =(
EDIT: Have since created a separate account and it works perfectly, they even replied to my ticket requests on this new account pretty fast. Received my BTC withdrawl (from this new account), apparently they fixed a problem with the mail service. Still waiting on my USD.  On the other hand, they have totally ignored my previous account with the stuck USD, along with any ticket i create at all. Sucks balls.

@_date: 2013-12-25 01:31:34
not true. doge is a popular meme with a huge following, and that existing community has allowed the altcoin to spread to a wide reach of people. even those who have never heard of bitcoins before.
I also believe that the community is rather big now despite it being so young, and have just launched a new version of qt client, and are also hard at work to build other infrastructure. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:35:02
Depending on where you are, use Coinbase.com for US dollars, and use Bitstamp.net for Euros.
Or you can also try P2P selling at localbitcoins.com and you can get a slight premium for your Bitcoins. Hope that helps.
@_date: 2013-11-12 17:46:23
try posting a meme on 4chan.. maybe an anonymous might help you lol :p
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:06:35
You can either 
1) Encourage them to open up an online wallet (coz it's simple to use, dont flame me coz its not as safe). then just donate a small 0.01 or smth to them to get going.
2) No matter how much money someone has, they can't possibly have "not enough to invest in Bitcoin". Even with $2 you can buy some coins, just that they get something with lots of decimal places; but that doesn't mean that $2 won't grow! So if your friend is interested but doesn't have enough money to do it, encourage them! Help them make it easier by selling them coins or buying it for them.
I always tell my friends. Buying anyday is better than yesterday. Hope this helps you =)

Great post. I don't see competing cryptocurrencies as a big threat, although I do agree that if bank/governments decide to enter the market they have a good chance of being to manipulate it. Then again, that's going to drive Bitcoin prices way up again.
I personally hope Bitcoin prices go as low as $500 so I can get in on "cheap" coins again :D The China news may have impacted Bitcoin prices and volatility but don't think it will last long and should pick back up within a week or two.

I haven't personally tried gox. I'm using Bitstamp and Btce. Bitstamp is serving me well so far, deposits and withdrawls are fast n smooth. For cash deposits, I definitely recommend Bitstamp.
Btce is good if you want to trade into other alt coins, by depositing bitcoins in there. Don't ever deposit cash into your btce, because they will not allow you to withdraw anything thereafter for a month.

@_date: 2013-12-07 21:22:01
Mainly because of China yes. After that news, panic ensued in the market as prices plummetted to $850, and now $575. When high impact news such as this as announced, coupled with the exponential growth since mid November, and market uncertainty as a "new commodity" to trade; it's natrual to see large corrections and consolidations before picking up again. Very much like the idea of "price discovery".
Market confidence may pick up over the next days as we find a new support at the $500-600 level.
@_date: 2013-11-22 11:08:20

@_date: 2013-11-22 11:03:44
Dont! my suggestion is to use bitstamp to buy your coins with usd. then if you wanna buy alt coins, send btc into your btce account. then you won't get the "money hold" problem either whereby it will require u to wait 30 days before u can withdraw anything after a fiat deposit.
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:36:02
I don't know whether it is truly "legit" or not, but it does appear to be. It could have been launched better, but well it still is making waves with over 10x increase over a week.
I do think, though, that the price is in the middle of a bubble, and could see it crash back anytime, before picking up again. However, I wouldn't know where the peak is. All altcoins bubble at some point in time, esepcially right at the start if you notice.
eMunie seems to be a better version of NXT, and pre-buy is launching sometime in Jan/Feb so keep your eyes peeled for that too. Then SKYcoin, also similar to NXT, has just began beta testing and could possibly launch in 3-6 month's time.

I had the same problem , I'm from singapore too. The problem is that when we deposit USD into their Czech bank account, the USD is converted into Czech Crowns, and that's where we lose out another 3.5% or so.
This is so stupid depositing USD into a CKR account to be converted back into USD. ANd they do not exactly convey this very well. I sent in money twice, first time i got it in 10 days. but my 2nd deposit was sent on the 4th of Nov and I have yet to receive it.
I recommend using Bitstamp for a more reliable deposit.
