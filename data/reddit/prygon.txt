I think the block should increase, and I don't know what to think about the asic jihan has.
Its more efficient. But its cheating. But it saves energy. But its better. But its patented. But it'll make bitcoin faster. But its unfair.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:49:47
Hes using bitcoin. Is there something wrong with that?
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:32:05
And its also cheaper. I have more bitcoin than bitcoin cash, but I don't think badly of it.
Free market choice.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:46:22
No, it be dash, ripple or maybe waves.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:34:09


You mean there is a free market choice that you feel is a perversion? They're savvy businessmen. McAffee thinks BTC will be at half a million in 2020 or something still.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:30:56
Howso? I thought they just wanted to put in their own method like visa for cash and siphon the fees that way.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:50:27
Great guide OP. I wouldn't have known about it if it wasn't for this thread.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:46:47
Don't blame a subreddit for a crypto. Its not the same thing. It doesn't own them. This sub won't change my mind about owning either.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:15:38
I wish it popped up first on the app store. Which is recommended for iOS?
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:16:52
So far I think BCH does the best job at being what satoshi wanted. Monero is something that satoshi would have approved, and thought was better, even in the forum posts he liked the idea of better privacy.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:31:10
Guess what does?
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:36:52
Hes the grandfather of crypto. I think BCH has better usage, and BTC is better for storing money. 
I think of bitcoin and the blockchain as satoshi's gift to the world. I think money you control yourself is beautiful.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:23:19
Will use that one now! Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:48:57
I regret using it as my wallet. It sucks. Squandered like 50 bucks on fees, and I have $10 that I can't move because its too expensive to move.
Its a piece of shit.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:38:10
Gone through the roof? I don't see that at all.
Looking at the stats: 


wow what huge blocks!!! 1.15MB?! That's way bigger than the 976.936 KBytes that bitcoin is at!
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:44:16


So far only bitcoin. It the best. But BCH does both decently. ETH is cool too, but its not capped.
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:04:43
That takes a while doesn't it?
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:12:08
I'll buy!
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:07:18
A house is no casino. An apartment building is what I want to buy with my earnings. I will rely on rent for income. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:22:56
If it's undervalued I can sell you some at 25k, still half price of your expectations!
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:02:20
Right, and you're a smart bag holder. I'll buy low and sell high as usual. 
Nice one bitcomedian, truly hilarious.

@_date: 2017-05-27 10:37:13
Yeha fuck using it as a currency. Slow, expensive and shitty. It holds value sometimes and not well. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:13:45
I'd sell if you're not confident. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:50:01
A bag holder related to a peak seller, someone has to lose and someone had to win. Glad I won!
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:33:31
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:06:31
Well it's speculative. I have seen 3 bubbles and this is the 3rd one. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:34:31




Not only am I glad I sold close to the peak's bubble I hope it goes lower since you're more and more butthurt. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:35:42
It's value is derived at the current time. I can easily retrace once I see it's bottom. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:19:25

@_date: 2017-05-27 11:10:16
It's always been that way though. 100% since mtgox. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:10:22
Show me your findings 
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:43:26
They can keep my moldy cabbage. I'll just disconnect my wifi antenna from the fridge. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:05:30
Funny your mum said all these things to me yesterday including how much her butthurts
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:36:11
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:44:00
No, gold doesn't decrease in value. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:48:41


Lol ��

Lol enjoy holding my bags while I buy asssets
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:36:13
 Could be a bull trap. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:46:09
Haha bag holders enjoy your loss
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:05:12
Haha �� you know me, never letting go!
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:59:09
Well have quantum computing then, bitcoin will be obsolete or hacked. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:25:26
Your butthurt is showing 
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:06:21
Look how he reacts. Lol
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:59:44




@_date: 2017-05-27 11:40:17
Like your mother on me
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:07:39
Exploding into another bubble isn't healthy as this demonstrates. 
I think the next level could be 10k or 7k, but 3k is barely going to be registered. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:30:22
Lol still butthurt �� I see ��
Bitcoin is still going down! Lol 
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:56:22
You can multiply your gains. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:32:55
 no it's not
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:26:39


Lmao, extra butthurt. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:42:41
I did at 1k and I'm still happy 
@_date: 2017-05-27 18:00:26
Housing is back, like bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:12:18
OP is butthurt and name calling because I sold at the peak. Look at our comment history, he's hilarious and makes "yo mama' "jokes" 
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:53:51
Is it saving them or just stealing? Can't those be cold storage wallets?
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:06:04
Don't believe it. It's just bag holders consolidating themselves. The next cycle could be years off. 
If you're into investing, bitcoin is more of a gamble than investing. Buy assets that appreciate like houses, crypto is a speculative bubble that bursts often. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:24:52


You're so butthurt it's hilarious �� 
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:28:25
Some of us will be dead by then
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:04:36
Probably? Nah. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 06:00:28
Whats the point? If a disaster of acid occurred or something, I doubt the internet will be intact.
