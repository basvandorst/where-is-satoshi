no it isnt
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:33:34
Yeah, but did we have a fucking giant backlog being responsible for the dip?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:31:14
As I said, I do not see it as investment, I use it as a currency. 
I mean, it was made to be used, right? What if I cant? Thats the point.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:35:59
I see, thank you nevertheless. Lets hope for the best for the mempool right now because shit is fkd.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:40:12
that fact is: Will btc have any value when this happens? We dont even have a timeline. Right now, everybody is on the dark.
And what about more frequent blocks?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:14:06
Hello, do you think you can help me?
I only can pay you in ETH since all btc I have is stuck (not much, but a lot for me, 0.1).
Thank you in advance

Man, no one knows when this backlog is going to be cleared up. No one. If the panic sells continue, it is a cycle. The backlog is going to be cleared up when btc reaches a very low value and the public interest is down to zero. Then, any change  will be meaningless.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:01:10
oh, it doesnt? what am I supposed to do with a fucking coin that do not work? 
And to be honest, the door is not a sell button away, as I said my transaction is FUCKING on HOLD for 3 days. I CANT EVEN SELL IT.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:38:04
40 hours here. Hold on, the shit is fucked.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:49:04
the only reason that the value goes up is because people believe in it. Right now everything bitcoin has achieved is going down. So I dont think holding value is the only option for btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:45:41
hahaha, yeah, I make burgers =) What I make in one day you make in a decade.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:52:35
the demand comes from the belief.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:17:40
Typical fanboy. Has 0.00001btc and earned 10bucks on the last month and think it is rich. You guys are a fucking joke.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:32:38
You guys are fucking insane. Downvoted because I exposed my situation and you only care about your cult. This is nuts. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:23:18
Have you even consider that I want to fucking exchange coins?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:43:58
for now. Do you think this is sustainable? Having the mempool clogged for months? pay 40usd for any transaction? The fact that there is not light in the end of the tunnel is what should make us worried.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:46:59
"not try to move them" perfect solution. Genius
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:02:21
it is not panicking man. I can do nothing right now, even sell it. thats the fucking point.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:05:20
its a binance wallet. I cant give my binance account to someone. TADA HOSTAGE.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:28:35
But thank you anyway =)
Lets hope it get in on the next 3 or 4 days.
I dont even have more btc to transfer and converting fiat to btc right now would take ages as local exchanges are overloaded (brazil)
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:40:32
cult. No one here is able to rationalize. Just fucking memes.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:30:13
Makes sense. But I dont think it was an attack. Looks more like it got clogged because of the public interest and thats it. I guess it was predicable. I was looking on mempool history and we have had others bottlenecks before, so I think that the fact the devs ignored it played a role here. And please, I know that the devs do not own nothing to me or anyone, but I guess this is a project that impact many lives and I think that are more people that effectively use it as a currency than as I investment, so I need it to work, that the reason I paid so much on each btc.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:21:25
  
about this.   
I dont know either, maybe they have their own miners and are able to confirm their own transaction. Dunno, but I pretty sure I am not the only one on this situation.
edit. Or if you send btc inside gdax, thats the reason, they can make the transaction internally without depending on blockchain itself.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:09:15
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:59:00
amazing argument man, you are really good at it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:08:45
Thank you for being rational and I believe it will change in the future for better, the problem is the timming. I think back at myspace era, we had some people who would fight for their beliefs on the platform, even with everything pointing to a different direction. I think thats what is going on here.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:03:57
yeah, cool man, congrats, what do you want? fucking fireworks?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:33:39
Yeah, but did we have a fucking giant backlog being responsible for the dip?
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:56:48
yeah, amazing digital currency, isnt?
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:57:38
yeah, because every other person will want to deal with a freaking dynamic fee everytime they want to make a transaction. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:45:54
I did, did you? Do you know miners choose what to put on the blocks? and that you can pay them to put your tx on the next available block? Iamverysmart folks here.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:23:19
It was going up yesterday too, before plummeting to 12k. Lets see how the market see a currency that is not able to scale.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:27:17
No it was a withdraw from a exchange to binance.com, mine is the 0.122, there are others on the same transaction. I paid 344sat per byte =[
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:37:06
I am trying to say the current dip is not relate to speculation itself, but the fact that the network is fucked up with no sight of coming back to normal.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:50:06
it will
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:42:19
this sub is ignoring the full bull effect. If the mainstream looses faith on btc, it will never go back as there are alternatives.
