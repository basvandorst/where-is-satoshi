What are your thoughts about having zero inflation? I personally think controlled inflation is better than having absolutely 0% inflation.

okay but once the supply of Bitcoin will be extremely low, like in 50 years, what would be reasons for people to buy Bitcoin?

Although 90% of my investment in Bitcoin is long-term, I’m making some nice extra money daytrading the other 10%, it’s not like I’m trading full-time but it provides some decent extra cashflow besides my study.

I know (e.g. IOTA) but can this be applied to Bitcoin to?

Same here, came in the scene quite late too and bought some alt coins when bitcoin was around 15k, then completely forgot about it until last august, started really getting into Bitcoin and Blockchain from then on and I'm now putting my savings in Bitcoin (long-term) just having some fun with short-term trading. I expect the price to lower the coming months before skyrocketing towards the next halving.

My ‘business’ is just a cursus where I’ll be teaching individuals or small groups (like a small business) about Bitcoin.

How do I admire IOTA, only thing I said is that it is completely quantum resistant where Bitcoin is not (yet)
@_date: 2019-10-18 10:55:58
Yup I’ll be buying around 6k too, depends on when it will hit 6k, see it falling to 4-5k too in the coming months

I know looking at charts can provide me with useful information, but I am hoping to get some advice from someone who was whatching Bitcoin at that time to see if there were some key factors why the price behaved in the ways it did.

Only thing I’ll do is spread businesscards around in my hometown, people who are interested can than contact me. I’ll give discount to people if they pay me in Bitcoin afterwards.

I sure did look up the price and halving data but I was asking for opinions and external factors that influenced the price, not the price itself.

I bought in dip and sold yesterday at a very low profit (My first short-term trades) Could have made a nice day-wage :( I'll definitely learn from this though

Have a look at the logarithmic Bitcoin chart, it shows that we are in the re-accumulation stage which will last until around the next halving, last rise to 14k was the expansion stage. The next bull-market will start around the next halving.

I see your point, my mistake is calling it a business. It is more of a side hustle where I make a little extra money by sharing my knowledge about Bitcoin.

Thanks for the info! I’ve heard a lot about DCA being the best long-term trading method. As I am not an experienced trader this will probably be the best for me. I am currently learning about it to implement is myself

You’re right, Bitcoin is superior. But a spacerace between them would benefit Bitcoin IMO.
