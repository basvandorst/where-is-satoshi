The fees for this are stupid high.
25% fixed APR. The lender only gets 15% and the company that made this gets 10%.
With fees like that, you're better off screwing your friends with high interest rates outside of this app. Because you know you're just as likely to get paid back, and a company isn't making money off of both of you.

I'll check these out. Thanks
EDIT: 
Okay, so it looks like Trucoin is invite only. I've signed up, and am in the process of waiting for an invite. Hopefully this will happen sometime soon?
Bitsimple is currently sold out of Bitcoins. How long does it usually take for them to restock? 
Any other options?
@_date: 2014-08-11 23:41:00
I already made a comment about this in my original post..
I don't care about anonymity, and do not want to pay 30% to buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-08-10 21:54:43
Bitsimple looks promising, the fees don't look that bad. (5%?) The only problem is that is says that they are currently out of bitcoins..
Trucoin isn't working for me at the moment. (On my phone, will try when I get home)
Thanks again!

Will check it out, and give a more detailed reply.
Yeah.. This method isn't very fast at all. I would have to wait for them to receive the money order, and they currently do not offer any other payment methods.
@_date: 2014-10-09 18:34:14
They only had one day to make a reply. I'm unsure how this will turn out.
@_date: 2014-08-10 19:45:59
There are no ATM's near me. Otherwise I would have already done this. All of the LocalBitcoins traders have really high fees in my area. (20-30%) 
I'll check out Purse.io. Thanks. 
EDIT: The rates on Purse.io are higher than Coin.mx and Virwox. Still need suggestions. Thanks though.

Well, Coinbase was really fast and only had a 1% fee. 
I'm kind of interested in an exchange that has fast deposits. Like is there some kind of payment method that can be used to deposit funds really quickly to purchase Bitcoins? I didn't like waiting a week for Coinbase purchases to go through before instant buy.

You can use Circle to buy with a paypal debit card. However, you have to verify your identity.
@_date: 2017-01-10 00:01:23
Yes. It works in similar fashion to the Bitcoin client. It's it's own wallet, and you are the only one with a key to it.
Coinbase has full control over your money. They could take your bitcoins if they wanted.
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:53:37
I just don’t understand why even risk a million on bitcoin when it’s half of what you have. I’m going to feel so bad for so many people on this sub when Bitcoin stops going up.
Crypto currencies are great and all, but they’re still high risk. It’s possible Bitcoin won’t even be the main crypto in a several years because better stuff is being made/completed

Why should I put myself at risk with Bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies that handle this much better? (stable coins, ETH, etc) Also, I don’t need to invest money to get those benefits.

I don’t have $1000 invested, what’s your argument for why I should invest?

Using a major wallet (breadwallet) is doing something wrong? What wallet do I tell my friends to use that 1) isn't centralized 2) calculuates the fee for them 3) is easy to use 4) is available on mobile phones?
@_date: 2017-09-11 09:47:16
Obviously haven't used Bitcoin lately. I *only* paid $2 to send $5 today.
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:03:24
I think Bitcoin is pretty shit for a lot of things.
It doesn't make sense to use it for 
* buying physical goods online or in person
* investing - its deflationary, so it's pretty bad for businesses/economy to use it as an investment. Plus managing bitcoins is a lot of work for a normal person. I'm doubtful a bank will ever want to use Bitcoin because there are much better crypto currencies available now.
* Avoiding fees/low cost. It will always be expensive to move small amounts of money because the mining network costs a lot.
* buyer protections
Where it makes sense to me though, and I actually see real applications:
* Where you don't trust the merchant with your credit card information. Best way to avoid fraud is to never give the merchant something that can be used against you
* Legal grey areas - For example, the laws on gambling are very confusing place to place. It makes sense to use Bitcoin to avoid your bank account being closed because you wanted to make some sports bets.
* Merchants with extremely high amounts of charge backs - For example, people who sell video game gold/skins/etc face much higher charge backs because people know they can buy gold with stolen information and resell it for real money.
* People who can't get bank accounts because 1) they're not old enough 2) they're not a legal citizen 3) their country has a failing economy with unreliable banks
And so on.. but for regular transactions it's pretty dumb. Your orders on Amazon have a guarantee to make it, or a refund will be issued. It's true value is in digital goods/some of the stuff above.
@_date: 2017-09-05 19:39:41
That wouldn't make a difference.
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:54:36
It's already been solved. It's called multi-signature, and it works on bitcoin.
It's not used often, because it's extremely complicated to a novice user. But, hey, your escrow probably already exists, and you could use it for your transactions... Though.. it's not really worth it. Might as well use a credit card where it is "free" for your escrow.
To answer your question, reversibility isn't a problem, it's a feature.

@_date: 2015-09-23 18:27:02
Yeah I noticed this and thought it was bizarre. It'd make it harder to run a business accepting payments through circle.
@_date: 2015-09-10 01:13:34
From what I've seen... The MyCash cards are not nearly as useful as MoneyPak's were. With MoneyPak's you could literally open card account after card account to load accounts with money to instantly withdraw..
This doesn't work with the MyCash cards. They require you to verify identity with PayPal. You can't even load them until you have a verified bank account on your PayPal. The other problem is Paypal is MUCH more strict than the card companies that accepted MoneyPak's. It's extremely likely that someone who is loading these to their accounts would have their account limited pretty fast.
The other problem is that paypal requires you to wait 90 days or so to get a debit card. So even if you could load these to your account, you couldn't withdraw it quickly. So anyone using these cards risks having the money they are collecting to be held for 6 months.. (And a permanent ban from paypal)
@_date: 2015-09-21 07:02:10
lol, me too..
@_date: 2015-09-08 08:38:11


I seriously doubt it. MyCash was created to replace MoneyPaks. It's still a very new system. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 23:41:10
Oh, I would definitely be using their system.. But the rates are just insanely high. 40% for me, and I've already been loaned and repaid over $1500...
My rates were lower, then they raised them way up... So now, I have absolutely no drive to even bother getting a loan.

US citizen here..
When using a debit card, your limit is $3000 instantly. (Wow, very cool...)
However, bank transfers no longer have instant access to funds ): Oh well, they were probably having lots of trouble with people buying bitcoins when they didn't actually have funds in their bank.
@_date: 2015-11-15 07:22:56
I think it's important to remember that if these companies can do analysis on the block chain then it's fair to say big government agencies could also do the same. (whether or not it's in the United States shouldn't matter..)
And in that respect, I hope they do the best they can so that new technology is created to prevent block chain analysis. I would prefer businesses blacklisting than oppressive governments deciding what happens to it's citizens over analysis of the block chain.

Currently a C.
For a $1500 loan for 180 days, the repayment would be about ~$2300. Which is ~70% APR. However, the 360 day loan is like 2400 repayment. Which is ~38% APR. 
Went and checked currently, and my current rate is ~$2250 for a 12 month $1500 loan. That is ~33%. Basically an over priced credit card, that is way more inconvenient than a credit card.

Why do you need to use bitcoin if you are not here for that?
I mean seriously, Paypal is much more convenient than bitcoin. It's easy for your friends to create accounts. Transactions are free. (in almost every scenario for the customer/family) You don't have to worry about losing large amounts of money from transaction rates changing.
If you're here for investment only. Okay cool, but why are you investing money into bitcoins if you don't support the reasoning behind it?
