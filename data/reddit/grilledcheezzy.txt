Well that’s how businesses “accept bitcoin” at all right now. That’s the best way to accept coins and it’s much more than not accepting them at all. It’s not very possible to accept straight bitcoin right now or at all really because of how it works in general. I’ll take payment processors exchanging to fiat over no adoption anyway.

There is one state that began accepting it for taxes. I believe it is Ohio but I could be misremembering that. So you’re entitely wrong in your statement. Maybe it should be almost no state accepts btc for taxes.

I like the latter option. Jack may be interested in this too. It could utilize the lightning network which would be great for his investment on lightning labs. I’m no dev but I’d be happy to help contribute in some way to an open source project. I can deal with people and assist in that way. Maintain some kind of forum or the like. 
Edit: what if this open source atm project could use square/LN on a raspberry pi with some cheap additional add ons like a square card reader. Then anyone can start an LN node that also functions as a little to no-fee atm. Maybe the LN node fees can be the profit for the atm which will help the LN network and bitcoin adoption by improving the user experience for those folks that aren’t as good with using the internet. This process would take the cash part out of the atm process bc that’s the largest issue making a DIY open source no  to little fee atm project a possible project. Just a couple of ideas that I think align with he original context of the community where bitcoin was born out of.

I would think it would be kind of self fulfilling though. If people began to transact everyday with bitcoin or any coin for goods and services the market price would be so high your daily coffee would be about the same within a few satoshis on a pretty consistent basis. Plus that type of thinking is what I’d call pretty old world. The real age of information we are entering will change macro trends like that id like to think. A few satoshis of change from day to day would be very easy to follow for pretty much everyone. Then the satoshi will be the real equivalent to a dollar or dime in some sense if it basically becomes the dominant way to transact everything. It would be pretty cool but a big change.

I know what you mean but millennials are in a specific situation which is likely to adopt bitcoin over other gens. You can include genX in there as well but millennials grew up with more technology advancement than any other generation and can easily adapt to new technologies. So I can see why we may be the most likely to adopt bitcoin over boomers and genX. Also, they don’t have to understand it or care about technology to adopt - I think the biggest deciding factor is that they can use it. It’s not like people use legacy money and really understand how it works either. The richest part is pretty pointless though.

@_date: 2018-10-07 04:06:54
Yes.  The idea is that the reward halvening creates scarcity which results in higher prices. Less bitcoin being minted through mining means a higher price point will be necessary to keep it profitable. If the price is too low to make mining profitable, then miners with their rewards will hoard their bitcoin which removes even more from the pool of bitcoin for sale which makes it even more scarce which drives up the price. This is assuming that demand remains constant at the very least but over the next two years demand will obviously increase and price will increase on its own from the general scarcity of bitcoin already. Therefore the halvening will result in even higher price point for bitcoin based on historical data.  The answer is Yes.

Yeah there was never any demand for your monkey comic. Scarcity absolutely has an affect on price when there is relatively constant demand.

Paper trading bitcoin is a way of synthetically inflating the supply. It’s a well known way that financial institutions have inflated supplies of other assets/commodities in the past. It is effective at doing this and it is a topic that needs to be addressed. If you aren’t buying “physical” bitcoin then it is not as beneficial to the ecosystem but there’s nothing that can be done to stop it so it is what it is.
Edit: as pointed out by another person below if they are covering the orders with real bitcoin in their supply then you are correct. This has no effect on the supply of bitcoin and it is no different than buying it from an exchange that delivers actual bitcoin to your wallet. This is a correction of what I said above since I was incorrect In this case.

Well in this case there’s been so much delay and let downs that it may be that sell the news could not occur since buying the rumor was less concrete due to the wolf crying that occurred. I’d like to see just a fun news pump since the approval has finally taken place. That was the main thing holding it back and causing delays.

The offering of future contracts. We haven’t had an institutional level trading platform that settles in physical bitcoin with future contracts yet. Also it is using the ICE trading desk for everything if I’m not mistaken. Same as the NYSE but that could need some clarification or confirmation. That’s what I’ve gathered anyway. ICE involvement, physically settled bitcoin futures and institutional level custodial services with insurance is a major combination we haven’t seen yet. ICE adds the institutional legitimacy and the insurance makes them feel warm and fuzzy to have the institutional investors flock to this platform above any others.

The mining network is decentralized. There are very large entities that mine a lot of the transactions but there are also other pools of individual miners that can compete and share the rewards. If any single entity or large scale miner obtained 51% of the hashrate they could maliciously affect the blocks that are created by selectively choosing transactions (blacklisting) or mining blocks for rewards that aren’t shared by the rest of the network. That’s a whole other thing though so don’t get too into that right now. Miners do set the fee prices but it’s a competitive market so it generally is as best it can be depending on the network congestion. The main driver of high fees is high transaction traffic because then you must pay a higher fee to essentially jump the line and have your transaction mined first. As of right now though the fees hardly play a major role in how the miners are rewarded and it’s almost entirely based on the block rewards minted to them when they are chosen to process the next block. Scaling would be the major future factor to allow fees to remain low and the network congestion to remain low. As of now a block is mined every 10 mins and one miner does that at a time, so adding more miners doesn’t necessarily resolve that issue because the block size is finite meaning it can only hold so many transactions. If proper scaling is implemented the block time could decrease and the blocks could hold more transactions meaning more fees can be collected per block, also meaning fees could become a large portion of the reward for mining a block if more can be collected per block. That was long winded but it’s pretty complicated and worth understanding. If anything I said is incorrect someone please correct me.

First part is all of the above. Should cover anything but losing money on betting with futures. I would imagine that as their holdings increase in value that will need to obtain insurance to cover all of their investor assets. It should be one of the biggest selling points to bring in institutional investors so they should continue to insure all assets in the custodial wallets.

I like that they finally put btc in the constant ticker. There was a time when I didn’t have access to the price and had to watch CNBC to find out. They’d only talk about to on fast money. I find this to be great. They will probably not show it any more if it doesn’t keep pumping I’d guess.

Gen z doesn’t have much of a reason to distrust banks imo. The millennials lived through the last recession and entered the work force during that time. I’m worried that they won’t turn toward crypto like we have because of that. This video certainly doesn’t make it seem like that will happen but small sample in one location.
@_date: 2019-10-01 14:05:09
Shouldn’t affect the cost of a transaction but mainly affects the constant sell pressure from miners that sell their coins immediately once minted. That will be cut in half basically.  Typically with less supply, the price goes up and the cost of a transaction would remain roughly the same once it adjusts. Mining is the reward for processing transactions between wallets at this time but eventually the idea is that the fees will become more and more important in paying miners in the future with more halvings and less and less bitcoins being minted.

I’d plan to dump just before the first contracts are set to expire. I remember there being a high correlation of major price dump taking place the same week of the first CME short contracts leading up to the expiration. The manipulation tends to follow the expiration of those contracts not when the trading opens. If anything it will be pumped leading to opening then dump leading to expiration. Mark my words there fella.
@_date: 2019-10-01 15:48:44
Obviously the fees will start coming into play well before the last bitcoin is mined though. It will have to be a gradual transition.
@_date: 2019-08-17 04:05:45
Ummm that’s not what the custody is all about in this case and it’s for institutional investors with a minimum of 10 btc. Since it’s supposed to be physical settlements of futures contracts in bitcoin, they needed some serious custodial services of a huge amount of bitcoin. Your average joe won’t be using their custodial services unless using a broker to handle their trading. 
Plus institutional investors will not want to hold their own keys and take all the risk themselves with no insurance on their assets. They’ll want a fully insured custodial service of all their assets. I read in another thread it will be insured up to 125 million $. It makes perfect sense and affects most of us retail folks in practically no way at all.

Seems like the btc maximalists are a bit worried about ethereums emergence as a crypto currency giant. Andreas attending ETHDenver may be the catalyst to all this worried discussion of competing with ethereums usefulness in many areas.

Security and trust will be its main contributions to the space as the leader and the very first working cryptocurrency in the future of this space. Good read.

@_date: 2019-12-15 13:11:26
Yeah I’ve read all the documentation too. There’s nothing that indicates that you are liquidated 100%. I believe it’s a percentage that is voted on by the community. So unless you have direct knowledge of the process (having been liquidated yourself) then you are wrong. I doubt any of you haters in this sub have actually used the cdp soooo yeah.
Edit: also you’re silly. The ethereum network is doing really amazing things and all of the different smart contracts built on top of it are incredibly cool. They are really changing the financial landscape and picking up where bitcoin left off. I don’t understand why you all have to hate on it so much and can’t support both because we all have the same goals in mind - which is change the entire financial system for the better and take control away from the banksters that ruin a fair and balanced financial system for their own greed. So stay salty if you want but bitcoin hasn’t done a whole lot in the past 5 years to improve its original goal while ethereum is making amazing strides in freeing the world from banks stranglehold on money. I’d like to see more things built on top of the bitcoin network too but it just doesn’t seem to move forward at any measurable pace.
Edit2: also, dai is not being “printed out of thin air” it is actually backed by the eth collateral locked in the smart contract. Your tether is literally printed out of thin air and that’s what was used to pump bitcoin to its current level. in reality it is your claim about dai but even worse. Now tether is moving to the ethereum network because the network value is obviously extremely high. If anything, the move to ethereum network for tether is a pretty huge indicator that a flippening is entirely possible.  You living in a completely delusional world if you actually believe the things you wrote. I welcome a healthy competitive nature of these two decentralized networks and bitcoin absolutely has its own issues with centralization just like ethereum or any large player in the space.  Both are trying to solve very difficult issues of decentralized networks and are doing an amazing job of it in their own ways. So sip on that haterade more while ethereum gains significant ground in DeFi - which is the future of the space. There is absolutely no disputing that. It will absolutely drive adoption for blockchain networks for the foreseeable future and bitcoin would be smart to jump on board or be left in the dust.

Oh for bitcoin like the post says, I think it would need to be a process for wrapping btc. I’ve seen ethereum based exchanges that allow you to exchange wrapped btc. It’s likely going to be wBTC that is used for collateral but maybe not.

Soooo salty in this sub against ethereum. It only liquidates 13% right now. It’s not the same as margin trading exactly.  Love how the new thing doing well is met with as much salt as the legacy financial system was throwing at bitcoin for the last decade... in the bitcoin sub.
@_date: 2019-12-13 14:55:03
No, there is no eth side chain. DAI is a coin on the ethereum network under the erc20 standard. It’s generated using smart contracts and the eth collateral is also held using smart contracts. There is no side chain.
