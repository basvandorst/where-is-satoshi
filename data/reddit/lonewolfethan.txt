That is true, unless the company does something stupid or something happens that the company itself has no control over. In fact, Apple's stock price drops every year around the time of WWDC, and both Google/Alphabet and IBM (especially IBM) has taken some hits the last half a year or so. Markets are, and probably always will be, unpredictable.
I mean, sure, in the long term it's usually a net gain, but the exact same things go for cryptocurrencies; if you invest in an already established cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin or Litecoin, you're very likely to see a net gain in the long term.
And sure, you could argue that a cryptocurrency could simply disappear one day, but again, one wrong move from a company, even a huge one, could result in a bankruptcy.
Of course, this is just my personal view on these matters. I am no financial advisor and have no previous experience or education in said field.

To be fair, so is the stock market, but I doubt they'll turn someone away for having stocks as their assets.
