1) No one recommended wire. It's slower and fees are too high for small deposits. You got the same recommendations today that you got yesterday.
2) You effectively increased your fees by mulling over fees. You might save $15, but you already lost as much.

The problem is that the title is grossly misleading to the uninitiated. A subreddit/forum for day traders would be far more appropriate than @_date: 2013-04-25 23:33:11


I smell FUD. If the business receives USD from bitpay, they are not accepting anything but USD as usual. Explain.
@_date: 2013-04-19 18:52:47
I've used bitinstant flawlessly many times just as described. My concern now is how they would handle a flawed transaction.
@_date: 2013-04-24 02:55:51
Somewhere I read that there are ~250K bitcoin users. Out of ~7B people, that's 0.004%. Probably a bit more than that now. There are 37K subscribers alone and similar numbers joining MtGox.

Seriously, though.. people keep repeating that, but is it true?
@_date: 2013-04-23 18:09:57
Yeah yeah, heard that tale before too.
@_date: 2013-04-22 23:14:12
If in the US, you won't need to be verified for 300.
@_date: 2013-04-16 13:57:39
I tend to agree with this assessment. ~55 is the 100 day moving average. ~35 is the 200 day moving average.

Bitinstant fee for $500 is ~$25 (via ZipZap/MoneyGram)
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:49:07
good luck
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:27:59
Even then, they didn't predict Mt.Gox.
@_date: 2013-04-19 18:13:08
Their express shipping method isn't cheap (~$100 for a single, iirc). I expect it would only pay off for early orders.

All currency trading is decentralized, but the quotes need to come from somewhere. The forex interbank market is unregulated and decentralized. Google's currency quotes come from Citibank (perhaps based on their own foreign exchange services).
@_date: 2013-04-22 13:03:00
Not at all. In fact, that's the coolest experience, because now your 'change' is worth more. I literally purchased something once and had enough change a few months later to buy another. Try that with USD!
*Keep spending coins separate from investment coins and you will not regret it. My only regret is that I didn't save any coins from that period. But make no mistake: bitcoins would not be where they are today if people didn't use them, and you will contribute to its failure if you don't spend some yourself.
@_date: 2013-04-19 19:47:30
Thanks for the clarification.

Wire transfer. Follow their instructions to avoid exchange fees. It took just over a day to hit my account last time (US -&gt; Japan). Some banks may not allow you to set it up over the web, though.
@_date: 2013-04-19 18:34:25
I don't see how the link supports that claim. It just points out that your backup wallets are still vulnerable after changing your password in the live wallet.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:33:09
This post could be freakishly meta.
@_date: 2013-04-22 23:14:52
Bitinstant -&gt; MtGox via MoneyGram (or equivalent). I've done it many times. You'll lose a bit in fees.
*as voiceofxp suggests, BitInstant -&gt; wallet might be better for you


I still trust gox more than most with my money.

You didn't answer the question. How would it be enslavement?

I'd subscribe. My technical analysis is a bit rusty, but bitcoin has renewed my interest.

Not a downvoter, but I suspect the problem is with [your confidence in being able to time the market]( - both top and bottom.
More succinctly, they don't want you spreading bad advice.

Pretty sure you meant 2024. Still unlikely.

CCs have chargebacks; BTC does not. If you could buy BTC with a CC, you could receive the BTC, claim fraud, and screw the seller, leaving them with no recourse. It's that simple.
*It's not just CCs. See the list:

At just shy of $300 million of BTC traded/day, we're still playing in the kiddie pool.


Bitcoin represents a fraction of a percent of that. So buckle up... If institutional traders get a taste for bitcoin, the USD price will skyrocket.

CampBX is for $10K+

If you deposit to MtGox in USD, you have more control over your entry point.
*Direct to wallet might be fine with them. I don't know. If they quote and commit to it before you transfer the cash, the only difference would be fees.
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:52:33
That was it.. thx
@_date: 2013-04-24 19:01:40
Good points here and elsewhere. To be honest, I didn't bother reading the text because of the title, but OP had a good followup.
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:19:50
You're calling this over based on the M5 chart‽
Tip: The price is still way above the 200 day SMA, which is ~35. When you look at the 'you are here' bubble guides, that's the 'mean'.

Same. I will say that the initial setup was not straight forward, but that's not their fault.

It's called arbitrage, and it's been done with currencies since forever.

It's called [Know Your Customer]( and it would only be suspicious if they didn't bother.

You litter your arguments with half-truths and FUD.


*Only* 2% more? That could be huge relative to your profit margins.


False - they handle all that "confusing internet stuff" too
You may have a rational argument in there somewhere.

When you pay more for gear/power/maintenance/etc. than you receive in btc, you're technically better off buying btc directly. I'm with you, though. I'll let mine run even if it dips below that line. For one, I like contributing to the network and 'earning' bitcoins.
