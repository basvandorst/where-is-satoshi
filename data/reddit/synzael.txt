Tiered costs are an interesting phenomenon but I don't think people use less bandwidth because they get less of it. Like internet is a strange enough resource that it's hard to incorrectly match up use to tiered pricing.

The thing about lobbyists is that they just give you a voice in the fight. The lobbyist with the most money doesn't always win but the people with the most money have a voice in every fight so they win more often than the people without a voice in every fight.

MDMA, LSD, NBOME, and 4 aco dmt are all good options. Nbome is the cheapest, mdma is the best deal, 4 aco dmt is the most bang for your buck and LSD-25 is not found pure except on SR

I don't use the road personally. I have heard stealth is more important than quality of product though. Products are quite equidistant in terms of quality
