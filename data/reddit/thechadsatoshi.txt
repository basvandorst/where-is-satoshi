The argument is: *you should be free to speak whatever comes to mind* ***AND*** *take responsibility for the legal consequences of it, in case it's illegal (e.g. conspiring to commit murder).*
It's not unreasonable at all, not even mythical. It's the most civilized freedom that you can have.

In Gab's [terms of service]( it states they don't allow people to use their website *"in any way that would violate any applicable federal, state, or local  law of the United States of America (including, without limitation, any  laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the US or  other countries) and is not protected by the First Amendment to the U.S.  Constitution (the “First Amendment”)"*
So feel free to report when you see people breaking the ToS, and if you're personally attacked you can take legal action against the individual. Gab will comply with any court order because it's an US company operating under US laws.
The fact that they don't take arbitrary precautionary action to "calls to hate" (which is extremely vague and subjective) is just a feature of their platform, and what makes Gab different from Twitter. They won't risk being judges of what is right or wrong but if they receive a court order asking to remove certain content I'm pretty sure they would do it. You might not like it that they don't act as judges, but then that's your personal opinion and problem with it.

Do you believe Monero's blockchain isn't decentralized? It's one of the most decentralized cryptocurrencies out there. Even their mining scene is very decentralized because they're anti\-ASICs. Many people mine Monero with consumer\-grade hardware making it very decentralized and secure.
