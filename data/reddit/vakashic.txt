Well, why both?
@_date: 2019-07-09 20:17:09
If not the ability to print the money the crisis could be much worse, and bigger wars could start.
@_date: 2019-07-13 14:13:24
Well, there is a "freedom" and interest of person against the country. The printing of fiat is a type of tax, that should be replaced by something else if deflation currency comes instead of fiat.
@_date: 2019-07-09 20:34:17
Well, I will respond to some of you here in one message. The deepest and longest financial crisis was during and because the golden standard. It has led to political changes in the world which led to the World War II. And you can not compare anything to that war. If war of that scale would start today billions of people would die ...
So today the governments can print money as an additional tax. This tax can and should be used for people by building schools, hospital, roads, police, parks, pay and help to poor etc. Of course more the government is corrupted the worse destination will this printed money have.
Also, in most countries, this tax money goes to armies and it is a gray zone, I can agree.
I also agree that the system has problems because banks misused their power to lead to subprime crisis in 2008. No, they were not stupid, they knew that the government can save them. But, still, only the ability of printing the money in 2008 saved many companies, people's jobs, and avoided political crises and the wars.

you are optimistic, but remember that nothing lasts forever, should diversify your investments
@_date: 2019-07-09 22:15:36
It does not matter. Look, at any case if bankers go against the law they should be controlled well and punished, else it is the system's failure.   
But if the FED can print money it has more power and tools (for good and for bad) to save the economy/people and avoid wars.

@_date: 2019-07-09 22:06:31
The crisis happens always, it happened more even during gold standard. So it does not happen because of money printing. The money printing is a tax that every fiat holder pays. This tax is used by government. Like in 2008 to save the huge companies from bankruptcy, and many people's jobs, like General Motors and others.
"We bankers need to rob you for your own good." - I do not like bankers misuse of their power, of course, like in 2008. These kinds of illegal behaviors should be detected and punished, of course.
@_date: 2019-07-13 13:43:14
You are optimistic.  
BTW, what do you think about WBTC lending on Ethereum blockchain?
@_date: 2019-07-09 21:47:38
Again, the gold standard in the first half of 20-st century did not save the two world wars... You should explain why everything was worse, because your logic does not work.
@_date: 2019-07-09 21:50:50
This looks like theory of conspiracy, talk finance, give numbers.
@_date: 2019-07-13 13:39:34
Well it is not so much possible by now, especially if you do not live in US for example.

good time to get in, these prices will probably never come back
@_date: 2019-07-14 13:08:54
Never say never, it depends  
If BTC does 100x, it will definitely do, even much earleir
@_date: 2019-07-09 21:39:12
I am invested in bitcoin, but not only in it, so you will probably die before me, if you are all in BTC. If you are criminal, anarchist or terrorist better for you to not answer me. But if you want to keep the constructive discussion you still can... if you will be aggressive and keep talking about death or some other non-respective messages I won't answer.
Money is printed and if people are not fool, the government/central banks decide where it goes. The printed money (M0/M1 for example, let us not dive into M2 and M3) is not given directly to you. Usually it should go to keep improving the economy of the country - for example in 2008 the printed money saved the huge companies from bankruptcy.
So if you want to see the whole picture you will understand that each newly printed dollar (euro, whatever fiat) is taking the tax from anybody who previously owned it.
@_date: 2019-07-09 22:30:29
That's right, but this is just bulshit for everyone. That's why I consider the central bank as a part of the system (government and central bank)
If central bank could not print money (like during gold standard), the system had less tools to save the economy/jobs/etc.
@_date: 2019-07-09 20:18:48
OK, interesting.
@_date: 2019-07-09 17:33:00
The question is if you know that GBTC really holds this amount of BTC. Where is their wallet? Where is the public keys so it can be checked that they hold these 200K+ BTC? Even the crypto exchanges (huobi, bittrex, bitstamp, binance, etc.) have their public keys of their wallets  [
@_date: 2019-07-14 20:46:59
I guess DCA - is dollar cost average
@_date: 2019-07-09 20:16:14
Well, Venezuela is printing too much, you are right.  
But I will answer below to everyone about the government.
@_date: 2019-07-14 11:17:44
Right, governments will oppose, but people vote in elections.
So if most of people will be convinced they will vote for bitcoin friendly politicians.
@_date: 2019-07-14 22:10:09
Good to know.
Found they have some sec filings I see.
But how can we know that SEC checks that they have this amount of bitcoins?
Is not Tether USDT regulated under SEC?
@_date: 2019-07-09 22:28:23
Sure, inflation happened in many countries, now it happens in Zimbabwe, also in less degrees in Venezuella and Argentina.
But it happens anywhere! Even in US dollars - the buying power of dollar has decreased by 95+ % in last 100 years. So what is your point?
Gold standard did not help to prevent two world wars.
@_date: 2019-07-09 20:40:28
You cannot ignore that there are countries that have normal and free schools, medicine/hospitals, police, road, public transportation, parks etc. and all this is done from tax money. I prefer to believe government and not to anarchists. But I agree that the system should be transparent, can be criticized. Nobody in the government should not feel above the country and the laws.
@_date: 2019-07-14 21:13:15
Sure, they publish the number.
But why they do not show their public keys?
Bittrex/Binance/Bittrex/Bitstamp/Huobi - all of them have their public keys, everyone can know how much BTC they have. Look at here  [ 
That bothers me for a little. They do not show the proof they really have this BTC.
Like Tether do not show the proof they have US dollars.
@_date: 2019-07-09 21:54:21
OK, so you think that BTC cannot compete with gold.   
Well, I have some news for you.   
BTC has even several advantages over your gold.  
For example it can be easily transacted, also it can be programmed. BTC is not heavy like gold while it still has a scarcity. So you should check the BTC price history - it has raised 1,000,000x, and need 35x more to pass gold. It is definitely possible. And even if not, it does not mean that they do not compete as a store of value.  
   
And I will agree about the volatility.
@_date: 2019-07-09 22:25:17
Sure I am aware that central bank is autonomous, but for me it is still the part of the system. You can call it government plus pseudo-autonomous FED (or central bank). At any case, each printed dollar is taking tax from anyone who holds fiat.

Come on, not all the regulators are dumb, there are many smart people there, of course.
Let us think about ideas how to accelerate the process of adoption by the big systems like governments and central banks.

@_date: 2019-07-31 13:49:47
Well, it is not exact.
Because I will never sell everything.
Pay attention, I sell always 2% of the remaining, not 2% of the original.
And also, after first 20% rise, the next 20% is 44% of the original. I do not assume the linear growth as you say, I assume the exponential growth.
@_date: 2019-07-12 13:13:15
I see you are trying to be a psychologist, do not do this.
If you have something related to the issue say that 
If not, at least respect yourself and stay respectful
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:47:59
It is a joke man, I hope most readers will understand.
@_date: 2019-07-09 20:31:58
Not so much related to what I meant
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:22:41
I think it definitely can be one of the main reasons. Imagine the company with billions of users can make them sooner or later expose to stable coins, stocks, assets and bitcoin too. Billions of Facebook/WhatsApp/Instagram users can ask questions about the BTC and easily buy it whenever they want.
@_date: 2019-07-17 08:33:58
why not, look, for example you have 10  BTC, that you bought at 10K USD
120%; ===========&gt; sell at 12K 0.2 BTC (remaining 9.8 BTC)
144% (120+20%) ====&gt; sell at 14.4K 0.196 BTC (remaining 9.604 BTC)
173% (144+20%) ====&gt; sell at 17.3K ….
207% (173+20%) ====&gt; sell at 20.7K ….
249% (207+20%) ====&gt; sell at 24.9K ….
it is an exponential growth, not linear
It can be less smooth but more clear - each time it grows x2 from the previous price, sell 10% of remaining BTC
@_date: 2019-07-13 13:44:06
Well, nothing lasts forever  
I think need to diversify the investments
@_date: 2019-07-12 21:34:10
Libra can accelerate this.
And the cheapest smartphones are accessible even for poorest countries.
But I think that having internet/smartphone/computers are not enough.
To my opinion (at least) two other things are even more important:
1. Crypto should give solutions to all the things that usual fiat currencies and banks do.
2. Regulators/governments should join the forces instead of fighting with crypto. They should see more advantages than disadvantages in it, even for them, not only for people in common. And maybe this is the biggest challenge.
@_date: 2019-07-09 20:18:34
Why are you complaining only about the dollar? The other fiat money is printed even more.
@_date: 2019-07-12 21:29:18


Very good point that shows advantage of bitcoin (or other not inflationary currency) over usual fiat currencies.
Did not think about it.
@_date: 2019-07-11 18:54:38
So my conclusion is that you could not explain me how bitcoin can  totally replace fiat currencies.
Probably you are invested in bitcoin and are attacking me aggressively because you cannot explain me in logic.
@_date: 2019-07-09 20:20:43
Printing money is a kind of tax. If the government is good, people and systems are honest, the tax money is going to work for people.
@_date: 2019-07-15 07:11:46
So you assume that there is a lot of "fake" gold and BTC sold to people, including GBTC and crypto exchanges?
Do you say that 70% of BTC available for sale is fake?
How did you come to this conclusion? Some facts, references?
@_date: 2019-08-20 22:01:50
Maybe, but I think they do not really care.
If bitcoin reaches 1 million USD, they can become the first US dollar trillionaires on the earth.
@_date: 2019-08-20 08:04:46
There are too many faketoshis that arrived recently.
Maybe the real Satoshi (a single person or team) lost the private key.
@_date: 2019-08-10 22:58:04
It does not matter 1K or 10K
Investors do not invest in 1 bitcoin exactly. Comon….
They invest some amount of money. Then what really matters is the percentage of the profit, how much you do, for example 2X, 10X or 100X.
If you invest in ripple XRP coin you will not buy a single coin for 30 cents and wait for it to reach million.
What if the amount of bitcoins would be 21 billion instead of 21 million? Would their price be still 10K by your theory? Of course not.
It does not work this way. You should educate yourself more. You should at least know that the market cap matters to estimate the limits of the coin price.
If you do not like math be careful with your investments, better for you to consultate with somebody who understands and you trust him.
@_date: 2019-08-05 21:25:12
Comon man, I am talking just about math, formulas. :)  
It should be simpler than becoming a miner, which takes months. :)
@_date: 2019-08-05 17:42:07
Good idea. But still, hash rate will adjust sooner or later, and investing in bitcoin will give a lot. Are you sure that in this case mining is more profitable?
@_date: 2019-08-14 09:10:16


Because the criminals know that they will not get this money from  the banks.

He **says** that he does not invest in it, while he actually invested many years ago.
He hoped that people will not know that he invested in BTC - this is what he **did**.

He does not :)
@_date: 2019-08-02 06:51:18
I think that in the future the usage will be more simple by UI improvement and also the younger generation will see it as something natural as well.  
Forking  bitcoin will not create another bitcoin, it will create something very similar. You cannot create something similar to gold so easily. This is the point. On the other hand as I said the technology advancements can bring gold from somewhere in the space.
@_date: 2019-08-05 12:35:52
At which realistic scenario can mining be more profitable than holding bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-08-08 21:37:38
why taxes?
until he does not sell he is not required to pay taxes
@_date: 2019-08-10 20:38:51
I do not agree claudiuok :).
You could say this about 10K when bitcoin price was 1K. :)
@_date: 2019-08-05 21:23:56
But the adjusting time is not so long. And how many BTC are you going to get for example for ASIC which costs 3K USD, probably 0.25 in a year if the adjustment is not done for a year!!
Let's assume that BTC costs now 20K, so you get 5K USD instead of 3K USD. In a year! If you buy BTC for 12K today, you also get 20K but immediately, do not need to wait 1 year...
@_date: 2019-08-11 07:21:50
Look, bitcoin has been even more volatile previously. And it did not stop the price to reach 11K by now. So people invested even a small amount of money in it and got rich. Now the market cap of gold is 10 trillion, and bitcoin 200 billion. So if you want to be in a safe side you can invest in bitcoin 2% of what you invest in gold. If you want to take a bigger risk it depends on you. I personally believe that the bitcoin market can surpass gold - it means bitcoin price 500K. So I am invested significantly more than 2% of gold in bitcoin. Of course it is very volatile. I understand that I can loose all the money invested in it. So I think if the investor is young and does not have a lot of money, I think the best for him is 20-50% in BTC. If he is retired then probably 5% or less. But it is only my opinion. Everyone should decide what is the best for him.
