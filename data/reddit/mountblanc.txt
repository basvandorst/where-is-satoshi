Or he was actually telling the truth and this thing really happened.

20 years ago noone knew how to build a secure decentralized financial system. Now we do. Anything that can be imagined can be engineered, if we know how to do it.

As far as I know most physicists agree that there is actually nothing in the "laws of physics" that prevent time travelling from occurring. Research it. Also, I hate the term "laws of physics". You shouldn't be thinking about the models we make of the universe as laws. We make our models to understand and predict the surroundings but ultimately knowledge is not bound by any laws.

Yes. If inventing blockchain technology were easy someone might have invented it prior to 2008. Since we don't have time travelling technology yet we don't know it's complexity level. Maybe it's easy once you know how.

Who cares? The CPC is a useless, evil institution just like the EU and the US government. They will all soon be replaced by blockchain technology. Down with the politicians everywhere, long live technology.

I mean maybe the guy who contacted him really was a time traveller. Anything is possible.
@_date: 2019-07-14 10:28:25
Did not though. I foresee this kind of stuff.
@_date: 2015-01-20 09:39:10
I would kindly like to receive a tip.

The goal is to buy food on a local food market and share with a friend and then documenting it. Others can fund this project or sell it as well if they are interested.
@_date: 2016-01-12 10:15:41
Interesting, send me a PM if you want to discuss it
@_date: 2017-03-06 10:56:02
Haha. The parasites are panicking. Who's gonna use their scammy fiat currencies in the future?
@_date: 2017-01-30 21:21:09
I strongly believe politicians and bankers look at the general population as cattle. They want high population growth because every human cow represents more income from taxes and so on.

Do not underestimate the power of Lagos. If they can purge themselves of the shackles of local politicians it could become a powerful crypto center.
Remember this is 2017, not 1997. Cities that were once financial centers are becoming peripheral and vice versa in the new crypto world.
@_date: 2017-01-21 14:21:58
Cool. Good job.
@_date: 2017-01-23 06:50:14
Not good. I am headed there. You think I still can find a VPN?
@_date: 2017-01-31 11:58:21
I believe everyone should have the right to move anywhere they want in this world but without state welfare. No borders, no welfare or social security, just cryptocurrencies and Dapps, secretive insurances and personal agreements.

Take down the terrorists in Brussels
@_date: 2017-01-31 13:30:22
I don't but you do.
@_date: 2017-01-30 15:46:45
What makes them think they have a "right" to "rule" us?
Politicians are only parasites, usually barely above average intelligence and do not understand geniuses such as Nakamoto and beyond that the mega geniuses.
Why should geniuses be ruled by mediocre parasites?
@_date: 2017-01-23 15:48:13
Yes. Please let me know if you come up with a good way of accessing the real Internet from inside "China".
Someone should develop a meshnet for that region.
@_date: 2017-01-30 15:43:23
If another "country" leaves then the whole scam project known as the "EU" might crack apart anyway.
@_date: 2017-01-22 20:21:34
Taxation is theft so Siluanov and all other politicians are just a bunch of thieves and crooks.
@_date: 2017-01-30 20:20:56
Wouldn't surprise me. All politicians suck and all their projects and mandatory hierarchies suck. 
Donald Duck is running on a road.
@_date: 2019-06-23 06:01:31
Even with all the US customers being forced to pull out?
@_date: 2019-06-29 08:25:15
No, I mean tips as in gifts or busking
@_date: 2019-02-28 00:29:28
He is providing a service though and selling a cd so not just begging.
@_date: 2019-06-23 06:27:59
Thanks. Also considering buying BNB. I actually don't like the Binance exchange due to many bugs and bad UI but I'm thinking our Eastern brothers usually know how to make big volumes. And that matters for exchanges.
@_date: 2019-02-28 01:56:38
I like it. If I can find a place I will let you know but please keep expectations low.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:15:18
@_date: 2016-02-04 13:25:48
Very well said and it completely mirrors my own sentiment. What you said is true and has always been true.
@_date: 2019-12-05 03:22:05
Don't worry man. Nobody ever really dies. It's all a learning experience.
@_date: 2015-04-29 09:10:40
Actually, I'm not :)
@_date: 2015-09-14 00:04:54
I am interested. Send me a PM please.
@_date: 2018-04-17 09:24:34
I'm in Vietnam at the moment and I don't see any KYC/AML popup or anything when I tried logging in to localbitcoins.com today. Does that mean that KYC/AML requirements do not apply here yet and that I can continue trading as usual? 
@_date: 2015-11-27 11:20:56
Haha : )
@_date: 2015-10-16 08:19:30
Well said. That must be one of the reasons those scammers want to implement it so badly.
@_date: 2015-10-16 04:54:37
Swish is a closed ledger, closed source system for sending fractional banking (ponzi) and fiat hybrid electronic money.
Hopefully the scammers and liars involved with it (Mr. Niklas Arvidsson (KTH), bankers, the government and others) will be destroyed as open source, open ledger, limited supply, hard cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin sweeps them away.
@_date: 2017-06-11 04:00:17
It is also because fiat currencies and nationalism are scams so the funds are flowing from scam money to real money.
@_date: 2017-06-11 04:43:52
Banks and states are quite opaque. They can do anything and the taxpayers have to foot the bill through taxes and inflation. Typically they are involved in a lot of warmongering too. Governments prohibit free currency and securities (token) competition.
@_date: 2017-06-05 03:55:20
The EU is looking for one thing and one thing only: increased fundings so they can expand bureacracy within their fiscal region and thereby increase the wealth of the parasitical political and banking classes (obviously the means to do so is through welfare and infrastructure development for the masses as usual). 
Down with the wicked EU and its henchmen. Long live individualism, knowledge and creativity.
