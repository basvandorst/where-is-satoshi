I did the same: 
I still don't understand how some of their shills couldn't see through months of nothing but incompetence that something was wrong.

You're going to bitcointip me? That sounds naughty.

I have just a couple thousand usd in btc there. I don't think that's worth scamming me over and causing a fuss, I'm sure people hold a lot more there. Just being cautious. Thanks for the suggestions though mate.

Bet on Roma DNB (Roma +0) vs Napoli today! Gives another incentive to watch what is supposed to be a good game

The calculation is incorrect: if nakowa wins 10 200 out 20 000, then house wins 9 800, and nakowa's total profit is 80 000, not 40 000. In order for the discrepancy between nakowa's winnings and losses (aka house's wins), which is profit, to be 40 000, nakowa needs to win at least 10 100 times. The probability for that is much more reasonable (around 8%).
Besides, someone on bitcointalk calculated the exact probability of nakowa winning this much, based off of the exact numbers rather than assumptions. I believe it was around 3%. If you ask me, this is not low enough to draw the conclusion that there is cheating involved.

Promoting a gambling site site is a means to an end (making money), not a goal by itself. What I wrote is that he can walk away with over 5 million USD. Unless you think that the prospective profit of this casino, divided by roughly 10 (he takes 10% commission) will ever be worth more than 5 million usd, walking away is a more favorable option.

Huh? How would you make transactions?

When betting in football 1/x/2, only the result by the end of normal time (90 minutes + stoppage time) is considered. Why else would they offer a draw, if a cup tie is decided one way or another after extra time or a penalty shootout? Since this was a cup game the game continued to extra time and Alcorcon scored and won in extra time.
It's a shame that you didn't bother to check the rules page (and in general have no knowledge of football betting) before accusing bitbook of scamming...

Yeah....that sounds like something I would do if I had all my life savings in bitcoin.

I've got thousands of dollars in blockchain. What is the consensus regarding most trustworthy online wallet? (I know, I know, an encrypted offline wallet is safer).

Suppose you are forced to play a bet where you input 100btc into a machine, and you have 1% of getting getting it back, otherwise the machine eats it. The expected value of your profit after the bet is -99btc.
Suppose you win the bet. Your net profit is 0 btc, even though as far as the machine is concerned you were responsible for "taking" 99btc from it. Does that make it clear? The expectation is just that, expectation, while our entire calculation deals with calculating the net profit (the binomial distribution) of the bets. The house edge is already taken into account due to the success probability of 0.495.

Look, your calculation is incorrect. Let's do this slowly: in order for there to be a discrepancy of around 40 000 between the expected profit of the house and the observed profit of the house, nakowa must have net profit of 2 500. 
In order to have net profit of 2 500, nakowa must win at least 10 006 bets at probability 0.495 each, out of 20 000 bets. 
The probability of that happening is around 7%.
Please explain which part of the above is incorrect.
EDIT: I think the part that we disagree on is whether the discrepancy between observed profit and expected profit of the house is 40 000 or 80 000. I don't see how it's 80 000, based on the statistics on the site.

Including the fact that Nakowa is a significant portion of the bank itself complicates things indeed, but I have no time to think about it or check whether I agree with you :(
@_date: 2013-10-01 15:36:21
I didn't incorporate house edge (you didn't either), I was just pointing out that the calculation as you did it is incorrect.
The graph is towards the bottom of this page:

You do realize he could just walk away with the entirety of the bankroll (50,000 BTC which is worth more than 5 million USD at current prices) at any moment if he wanted to, instead of hatching weird schemes? dooglus is one of the most trusted members in the community. Besides, due to variance, the probability of the profit being negative even after 4m BTC wagered is not astronomically low.

Sure np, just the title sounded a bit sensational.
Also in general betting on football when you have no information advantage over the bookie isn't considered a good idea :P

the exact moment of the arrival of the BTC (over which the sender has limited control) does not authorize stealing the coins, it is entirely possible to send the coins back to the sending address (without a transaction fee)
what's written on that website has absolutely no bearing, on anything
practically, the site could just keep the coins and tell the user to fuck off (which it is doing), regardless of what bullshit they add to the fine print in the last minute. 
by all reasonable considerations, the site should return the BTC that coincidentally confirmed after the bet was resolved.


mircea pls go

There seems to be a confusion anyway. Nakowa didn't outright win 40k, he won 2.5k, but OP pointed out that is around 40k above expectation.
To have a profit of 2400, you would need to win 10006 out of 20000, at probability 0.495 of each win, we have that winning that much or more is around 7%.
