The general public needs a stablecoin. The only stablecoins available now are pegged to the US dollar. The creation of a stablecoin that is not dependent or connected to the dollar will begin the real mass adoption. 
There are 2 ways that can happen. The first is for an independent organization to give a value to bitcoin or any coin (beyond demand and supply), just like when the US dollar was based on gold owned by the US. The second is for a cryptocurrency that will be a reference point (with a fixed standard of its own) to be created.

Why would you pay $1.2k for a shiny yellow metal??

I'm thinking; why can't government be crowdfunded? Instead of paying taxes and let congress or parliament or senate (etc) determine what to do with it, why not allow people to direct where their taxes go. All government agencies and stuff should have crowdfunding platforms and they will be open about how much they need to raise and make their case, and people give to it. 
Fines will be used to pay debts. The people will have a minimum of their income or revenue they must contribute to government projects and stuffs. There is no maximum. Congress, senate, parliament (etc) will still be necessary to determine what gets allowed for government crowdfunding and what does not.
Sounds like the future where crypto is mainstream

Sorry if that sounds like a troll. I'm just trying to put things in perspective

Instead of trying to buy the dip and sell the top, why not be cautiously optimistic. Get in every month (or every week). The lower the price goes, the higher the amount you buy.

If you have lots of lands and you are willing to diversify some into crypto, you may sell. However, do not sell all you own. Don't even sell up to 50%. 
Also, you can hedge. Buy btc with your land money without selling your land. For example, you may take a loan, use your land as collateral, buy btc. Then, go stake your btc (or change to eth) on a platform like MakerDAO. Issue Dai from it (when the value grows). Use the Dai issued to pay back your loan in bits. Use your land for business and make money to return the Dai issued, and you get your original btc or ETH unlocked.
The process is simplified here but if you do your research well, you will understand the details.
