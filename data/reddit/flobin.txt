Ah, well then let me return the difference to you. Could you PM me your address?
@_date: 2014-01-16 12:45:30
Do you know who makes that? Because they missed the Dutch exchange (bitonic).

That guy must be Dutch.

This is actually great stuff. Bit of a late reply, but, you know, Easter and all that.
As far as I know, by the way, the nylon bristles were selected because they're better than current eco-friendly alternatives. That's one thing that sets us apart from alternatives that are out there right now. The other thing is the subscription model.
But thank you for the good advice and links!
@_date: 2014-02-11 22:42:39
Well, not right now, obviously.
@_date: 2014-04-16 22:18:49
Sadly, I must admit that they are not. Perhaps a future version of the toothbrush will have biodegradable bristles.
I have turned on shipping to the US (for now), but beware that there could be customs fees.
@_date: 2014-04-02 13:01:11
My bad. I’m based in the Netherlands.
I do plan on using BitPay.
Thank you very much!

The thing about alcohol is that it’s not intended to kill. Guns, though, are. In my opinion, that makes them terrible things.
@_date: 2014-04-02 20:10:36
Well, you know, it does help that the Netherlands is a bit of a tax haven, so if you’re going to set up shop in the EU, you might as well do it here.
@_date: 2014-05-11 20:53:13
Really? I’ve paid with bitcoin for several humble bundles. I’m in the Netherlands.

Ah, yeah I don't really need your phone number, I'll try to fix that soon!

In the Netherlands: debit cards. And online, there's this system called iDeal. I don't know the offline merchant fees, but for iDeal, they're comparable to PayPal. (And for consumers, iDeal is much easier than bitcoin.)

@_date: 2014-04-16 16:48:56
By the way, currently shipping outside the EU is not available, because there will likely be customs fees. If, however, you are a brave soul and would like to be our first ex-EU customer, please get in touch!
Anyway, thanks for the good advice recently and for helping me learn about bitcoin in general!
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:47:37
I never said everyone who uses a gun has the intent to kill. I said guns are intended to kill. (As in, that is why they were invented.)

Something similar happened to me. Since then I’ve changed my listings to only accept deals from people who are verified and have a positive feedback rating. You may want to do this as well.
You could even have a listing for extremely small amounts at a high markup that you do offer to people who don’t have any feedback and have no verifications.
@_date: 2014-04-16 19:49:06
That's great to hear! So if I enable shipping to the US, would you be willing to be a guinea pig in terms of customs fees?
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:24:44
Or localbitcoins.com or kraken.
@_date: 2014-04-16 20:10:07
Haha, I bet you couldn’t wait!
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:05:36
Judging by this comment’s score, it appears quite a few people missed your sarcasm.
@_date: 2014-08-27 13:23:45
Haha, their taste in cryptocurrency is clearly much better than their taste in music.
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:14:22
Well, my comment was mostly a reaction to all the people concluding that Jon Stewart must love bitcoin. I doubt that he does. You are probably right, though.
@_date: 2014-01-29 20:28:00
Wow, that is all kinds of awesome!
@_date: 2014-04-17 07:43:48
I’m curious, too, to be honest! I can let you know once the first Americans have received their orders!
@_date: 2014-01-05 16:02:59
Yes, you are correct. And then you'd wait weeks for the money to actually show up in your account, because it's mt gox. (At least when I tried to withdraw from them, it was going to take weeks.) 
@_date: 2014-04-16 22:32:11
Hey everyone, the response has been great so far, thank you guys so much. I’m going to bed now, but if you have any questions, feel free to get in touch via the site or just leave a comment here and I’ll get back to you in the morning!

I think I will stick with just one type of toothbrush for now, but if lots of people start asking for hard bristles, I will definitely add that option. There is not yet a version that fits on standard electric toothbrushes, but that’s definitely something I’m looking at!
@_date: 2014-04-02 14:10:49
I did not know that. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-04-16 22:19:09
Go ahead!
@_date: 2014-03-31 20:23:01
Yeah, I don’t think he would insult his own audience like that.
@_date: 2014-04-16 22:23:05
I suppose you’re right about the bristles, but since you’re supposed to change your toothbrush every three months anyway, they might as well be more eco-friendly than regular plastic ones, right? In any case I agree and I’ll do my best to make everything fully sustainable.
@_date: 2014-09-05 10:08:49
Same here. Couldn’t even install it.
@_date: 2014-09-11 23:32:05
Have you tried bitonic?
@_date: 2014-02-10 22:37:35
It’s been ignored (not removed) ever since they blocked transfers, as far as I know.

For businesses, it's a tax haven. For instance, see the [Dutch sandwich]( or [this](
@_date: 2014-04-17 12:02:35
I will. I actually only enabled US shipping last night because of reddit, so hopefully all people who placed orders then read my comments. I’m working on a geolocation-based warning now; once I put it up I will enable shipping outside the EU again.

One good way to store your bitcoins is to move them into cold storage. Electrum can help you with that. Here’s how:

Thank you very much! Edit: by the way, if you had 0 bitcoin on January first of 2013 and had, let’s say, 5 on January first of 2014, would you pay vermogensrendementsheffing? Because your vermogen didn't really have a rendement over that year.
@_date: 2014-04-16 21:25:49
They will indeed be shipped through regular ‘airmail’. Luckily the toothbrushes are small enough to fit inside a (padded) envelope. So hopefully it shouldn’t be a problem!
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:51:52
Guys, there’s a big chance Jon Stewart doesn’t care either way about bitcoin, but the Daily Show knows their audience and their audience likes bitcoin (and/or dislikes big banks).
@_date: 2014-04-16 20:10:55
I’ve just enabled shipping to the US. If you could place an order and either add a comment that it’s you, or send me a PM with your name or some other identification, that would be great!
edit: and other potential US buyers, please be aware that if you place an order now, you may have to pay some customs fees.
@_date: 2014-04-16 21:27:50
Hmm, well, not yet, because I haven’t actually had them for that long. Feel free to ask again in a month, though!

Neal Stephenson wrote something a little bit similar in Cryptonomicon.

This happened—well, is happening to me, too. However, the bank took a look at my account and the transfer on localbitcoins.com and are siding with me. Thank god.
Localbitcoins.com support have not said anything, even though I contacted them about four days ago. Not great.
Best of luck to you!
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:07:47
Hey, wow, thanks.
I guess personally, my main reason for thinking it’s not legit is the UN thing—would the UN really pay someone in bitcoin?
By the way, perhaps you should not rely on consensus in some reddit thread, but figure out a way to verify things for real. Perhaps you could get in touch with whoever put up the job. Although right now, since you run this as a one-man operation, I realize that may be a bit far-reaching.
Anyway, thanks for commenting!

For some reason bitcoin.de is almost always cheaper than most other exchanges.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:01:06
If you’re in Germany, try bitcoin.de. Best exchange for those in Europe, if you ask me.
@_date: 2013-11-05 22:58:04
Gotcha. Thanks!
Are deterministic wallets less safe, because if someone has that one seed, they can have all the other keys?
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:04:04
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:24:01
To me that sounds like you’re still paying for something in dollars. Except in between giving the dollars to the merchant, you convert it to bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:04:14
So, if I understand correctly, if you lose a wallet with some bitcoin in it, you can regenerate it from the seed, because bitcoin balance is tied to the address and the seed will regenerate the same address?
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:33:32
Ah, thank you very much!

If bitcoin is truly a paradigm shift, that would mean bitcoin is being used as an actual currency, right? I think that’s not the case right now. Due to people mostly using it for speculation (I’m guilty of this, too), its value fluctuates too much for it to be used as an actual currency. 
For example: I bought seven pizzas yesterday, which cost me 0.1243 bitcoin. I did the same about ten days ago, but back then, 0.1243 bitcoin would only have bought me a little over four pizzas. So how could I ever say how much a bitcoin is worth, if in only ten days its price almost doubles in terms of the amount of pizzas you can buy with it?
Please correct me if I’m wrong.
edit: oh and by the way: haven’t all those markets already been accessible to each other with, you know… money?
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:47:33
Oh wow, thank you so much! 
To be perfectly honest, I'm not sure what point you are making, but I like your idea of using your 'free' pocket change to tip people with. I might just do that myself.
By the way, this is my first reddit bitcointip. I'm not sure if it's proper etiquette to post a thank you, since I've read people saying they hate it when redditors amend their post to say thank you for reddit gold, but my instinct tells me this is the right thing to do.
