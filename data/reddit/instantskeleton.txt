I have had this idea for a while, he doesnt need sponsors before hand. Take a risk and get a large QR code on his pre fight banner and postfight/walkout shirt.  "I fight for tips" with a Bitcoin QR code.  boom. bitcoin community delever's again. That would show the true capabilities of bitcoin esp on a PPV event. I buy the PPV just to see him in a BT shirt haha.

not sure if this helps your situation, I have used quickbt.com for up to o.2 BTC buys, I debit from my bank. not sure what the other purchase options are there.

quickbt.com,  there is a large fee imo (10 dollar fee on 0.2 btc) , you can only purchase 0.2 btc per day.  but it is quick and you can check out with a credit card.  easy to use i have never had an issue.
