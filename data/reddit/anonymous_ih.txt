If it’s in small portion just keep it there. The fee alone will kill you bro.

Sorry my mistake, i thought this is other thread lol. The fees for bitcoin is very high, based on Bitcoin average fee (you can google). While ethereum is low. If you want to transfer don’t even think of using bitcoin. Use ether instead, fast and cheap :) 
Last ether transfer fee for me is 0.00005 eth
