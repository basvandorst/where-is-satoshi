Translation: He has every business intention of centralizing Bitcoin for his own gain. Does he really think the Bitcoin market, the buyers, will follow him and his greed? Does he really think the market can't see what he cares about? His business model is not what's important....at all. If people don't buy Bitcoins, he has no business, so he can figure out how to operate for the greater good, or perish into the abyss of avarice. 
He has a choice to make. We all may have a choice to make, soon.  Choose wisely.

I've always asked why Bitcoin can't have a flexible block size. Like having only one point size in your computer. You have all this technology, but limit yourself in how many, or how few, transactions you can do on a global platform?  This should be the goal of Bitcoin to serve all users quickly and efficiently. There is nothing efficient about one size fits all blocks. You either have wasted space or many delayed transactions. Be better than that.

I like how LocalBitcoins.com sets up their wallet. You do get multi-facet authorization, and they change your public key randomly a couple of times a month so your incoming transactions are harder to trace back to you. It's free, and its convenient if you want to get in and out of fiat. All bitcoin wallets can trade bitcoins with other bitcoin wallets. Some are just easier to use, or more secure, than others.
Down the road, I'd invest in a Case Wallet or Trezor, if you're gonna hold any larger amounts

If you don't really like or understand Bitcoin, and are just looking at it for investment purposes, I say don't do it.
The dollar value of it is far from what its about. If that's all it means to you, you just don't get it, and should not invest until you don't get an understanding of what it is and what it means. Looking at Bitcoin and worrying about dollar value is like looking at a girl and only caring about skin color.

I wouldn't expect any instant value spike that is sustained, but a slightly faster appreciation over time. When Bitcoins are harder to get, the miners are going to have to sell more Bitcoins to fund their operations, creating downward price pressure. More sales equals price drops, not increases. You need more adoption and sales to increase price. Don't expect values to double overnight. Bitcoin is far from that simple, economically.

WIRED made a great article about it, from the inside out. Look it on their site.

They used to be, but they started limiting my trades to $30 each. Don't expect to move a ton of volume on there.

Bitcoin is the revolutionary invention. The blockchain is just a slow ledger. Banks won't admit this is a fact.

That's an impressively desperate reach to compare a 21 to an iPod. Be better than that.

1. Excuse Andreas for being awesome.
2. Instead of all of this being built into the machine, maybe downloaded apps and videos onto your phone would be more practical. Nobody is going to stand at an ATM for 1-2 hours, but make it so they can take some knowledge with them to use at their leisure. Unless you want fees to be 10-15% per transaction, paying people to man a Skype connection 24 HRs a day is not feasible.

Centralized systems with consumer data are like honeypots to hackers. This will keep happening for many years to come. As long as banks keep consumer data to run their antiquated counter-party risk systems, consumer information is at risk.

No question, especially as the fiat currency continues to collapse under its own debts, country by country. And don't be naive enough to think the U.S Dollar is not on the list. America's economic collapse is coming. The only question is when.....

Sounds like another day in the E.U. Isn't this what German people want?  To be told by globalists what to do? That your money is really their money? Why do you think Great Britain, Greece, France, Italy are all trying to get out of the E.U. as fast as possible?  This is the future they have waiting for you!

Now that Bitcoin is legal tender in Japan, this could continue indefinitely.  This may be the start of a real "digital gold rush."
