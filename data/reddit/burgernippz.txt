Can’t complain really can you? Still a good increase, we didn’t expect to hit 10k by Christmas and you’re complaining about a low of 16k??
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:26:55
That’s.. Like scratching your phone password into the back of your phone, that’s incredibly stupid.. I mean, c’mon.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:33:08
Okay 20 ish minutes later and that’s done, now what?
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:40:08
I think* you need to add that to the beginning of this sentence. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:56:14
That makes about zero sense, are you okay?? I’m here if you need to talk about anything..
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:48:04
I just, I just don’t get it.. Why is this sub just a shitstain now, can’t find any useful information.. I actually miss the memes compared to the horde of useless posts it now is...

Although I do respect a well throughout and “researched” answer, I don’t believe you can attempt to value Bitcoin at this moment.. As other users have pointed out, we’re in the “Wild West” of BTC.. This is the infancy and it is very hard, there are people talking about bubbles, and some people saying it is correcting itself.. But no one knows, you can’t go off the stock market because this isn’t the same as a businesses performance so it varies in different ways, honestly you have the ‘HODLERS’ and the ‘Day Traders’ and the ‘Whales’ and no one can predict whether it will crash in 2018 or rise till the early 2100’s when the last coin is mined... If you can name me one person who knew it was gonna but 10k and then 11k with what 24/48 hours of itself I’ll give you my bitcoin.. I’m drunk so this might not make sense but (I think) this is how I feel about it, hope his helped? Possibly

You talking about BCash?
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:16:30
Is that a joke? It’s around $5k for 5 nights??
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:10:29
Why can’t you do that..?
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:59:17
Please could you add a “My opinion is” before posting these comments..

GDAX won't accept any of my forms of my ID, no matter how clear and bright the pictures.. So I don't know which exchange to start up with, kinda annoying to be honest.
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:34:20
Yeah this is very true, it's just annoying that the people who once asked these exact questions look down on the 'newbs' because they aren't like that anymore, we all gotta start somewhere, if we all knew everything straight away non of us would be rich!
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:46:59
Ahh okay, yeah that makes sense! But I guess both interpretations have the same meaning lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:15:06
I see where you’re coming from exactly, but this isn’t stocks, this is “the people’s money” although it sounds cheesy.. Fear comes with these things and it takes the brave ones to back it up and keep faith in it, but I do agree this is a scary time.
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:53:48
You didn't give any names of exchanges, like the OP asked for? Just kinda gave your opinion.. Do you have any to suggest?
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:21:37
Didn't switch to your other account or?
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:23:26
I'm not OP but good on you for not belittling him because he hasn't done loads of research, this is the good shit I want to see more of on this sub!
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:26:47
This is exactly what happened in my head lol, just a big fuckin question mark
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:52:13
Yeah I'm pretty sure it gives you that amount because the fees are included as well!
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:09:37
What do you mean? Sorry for not getting it straight away��
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:34:38
How do you earn BTC? That sounds cool! Does hodl mean hold? I've seen it a lot but never knew what it meant. Thanks for helping out 
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:20:27
I'm travelling the world and it's 3:20AM right now in Vienna, Austria! I'm just having a good time
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:27:29
So (I'm talking from a hypothetical) would that mean that those people make it centralised (I know by definition it's not) but these people who own loads of BTC don't they manipulate the market and bend it to their will? Earning a shit load on the way...
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:06:53
Yeah, although we're getting some solid good news at the moment I just thought this would like the cherry on top!
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:34:25
Ah okay, thanks for the answer. Just that a friend suggested Exodus so I started using that :)
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:08:43
Talking about the all time highs we've been hitting haha, and everyone coming together to help the 'newbs' not fall into the trap of buying through bitcoin.com
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:20:26
Ah okay I get you now!
Yeah I feel like if I was invested (which I will be shortly) that would be like torture by a thousand cuts if I looked at it every day/ week lol. 
I'm gonna just invest and forget, keep adding to it slowly over time. 
Thanks for all the advice 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:31:36
Yeah I'm travelling at the moment but the last couple of days has been researching Bitcoin haha! Thanks for the advice 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:09:41
It’s a Facebook post... Why would they post it on Facebook when there are a hundred better sites to pick.. And also looks like a BitcoinCash FUD scheme. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:46:01
That’s just, not right. But let’s agree to disagree. 
@_date: 2019-12-26 13:18:54
Before I ask my question. No I'm not instigating an argument or defending him and no I'm not American. But has he been charged with these crimes or are you just saying things towards someone you don't like?
