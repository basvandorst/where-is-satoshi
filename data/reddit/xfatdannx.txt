Still gonna lose 1/4 of my btc if I leave CB...

I must have misunderstood, i didn't realize it was free between CB and GDAX. Is that a safe transaction?

why do i have to upload an ID? doesn't that defeat the purpose of anonymous?

That's what sports announcers always do. "This is the single game record for strikeouts by a left handed pitcher during a full moon on a Tuesday night" haha
