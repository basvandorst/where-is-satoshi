After looking at his video clip, my suggestion is to load the currencies one at a time, so the prices cascade down the screen as they all load.  It would still take the same amount of time to fully load, but you'd be able to see it's doing something, and a partial list is more useful than a spinner.

If everyone has that attitude, it'll never see widespread adoption.  People need to start using it and forcing it on everyone else.
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:56:54
When I say "forcing it", I mean simply using it, and telling other people they need to use it to transact with you.  PayPal is successful because eBay essentially requires it to buy stuff on their platform.

Open source doesn't mean you can't sell it.  How many Apple users do you think would want to shell out $100, download xcode, and compile it themselves, vs just paying 99¢?  If clones are a concern, just change the license to include "copy, change, blah blah whatever, just don't swap out the icon and reupload to iTunes"

Compare and contrast:
  
Microsoft: 709 in 2018, 6193 total  
Linux: 171 in 2018, 2195 total
Based on CVE counts, Linux is almost three times more secure overall, and over four times more secure last year.
Also, it's a little alarming that Windows Defender, a tool that's supposed to prevent attacks, has seven vulnerabilities with a severity score over 9.

It depends on error correction levels, and if any of the corner squares are damaged.
I've successfully scanned a damaged QR code by coloring in the missing parts of the corner squares with a sharpie.  The other damaged areas were recovered by the built-in error correction.
When you scan a QR code with a logo in the middle, your scanner sees the logo as damage and recovers the obscured data using the rest of the code and some math.

QR codes don't take much effort. Inkscape has a plugin that generates them as vectors.  Even for a JPEG, since QR codes are large and blocky, it's hard to tell you've scaled it to 400%.

IDK, if Bitcoin is classified as property for tax purposes, then it can't also count as money, right?  You can do the same thing without Bitcoin: buy something expensive with bad cash at Walmart, return it to a different Walmart for cash, say it was a gift you didn't like if the IRS asks.

Or that all good browsers (read: Firefox) have a built-in screenshot tool that lets you grab the visible page, the whole page, a drawn rectangle, or everything inside a `div` or other code block.

If the corner squares are intact, you can lose up to 30% of the code (depending on the settings when it was generated) before it won't scan anymore.  That's how brands put their logos in the middle of QR codes.

It sucks up resources from other stuff.  I regularly have 50 tabs open, plus a code IDE, plus a virtual machine (or two).  Firefox works better.  I have Chromium for cross-browser testing, and it feels laggy, like it pretends to be fast but actually takes a while behind the scenes.
@_date: 2016-10-02 02:59:57
FYI, Firefox is on track for full process separation by the end of spring 2017.  You can download the developer edition and try out what they have so far (they've already separated the browser chrome from the web pages).

There is plenty of statistical evidence that a traditional family is a lot better at raising well-balanced and productive children.
There is actually a population crisis today.  Many countries don't have enough population growth to offset the deaths and retirements of the older generation.  That's a bad thing.  You need young people to do things and care for the elderly, otherwise your economy and society fall apart.
