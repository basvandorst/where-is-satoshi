The blockchain would be the same size. All transactions get confirmed eventually. The only difference is that the 2MB blockchain would clear the backlog faster, and fees would be lower as a result.

Why are you telling people to use SegWit when this will make the blocks bigger which makes it harder to run a full node? Or are you saying that the 1MB size is too small and that nodes are able to handle an increase from the current level?
@_date: 2019-07-02 08:02:27
I couldn't agree more.
I just find the backpedalling on this subreddit funny.
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:03:22
Won't this cause centralisation?
@_date: 2019-07-02 08:01:47
It sounds like you're saying that a block size increase over 1MB is what bitcoin needs.
@_date: 2019-07-02 07:56:50


Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr wants to reduce the block size to 300KB.
@_date: 2019-07-03 00:07:29
If that was actually the plan - SegWit and then hardfork, I would support it. But the hardfork is never going to happen. Luke Dashjr wants a block size *decrease*.

Has anyone ever asked him why he doesn't just log into the bitcoin talk satoshi account and make a post?
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:01:39
Indeed. The doublethink is hilarious.

When people like this are buying, it's time to sell.

Half as many blocks that have transactions, I mean.
If N transactions are sent:
Case 1: The block size is 1MB. You end up with X full blocks, and then Y empty blocks after that until more transactions are sent.
Case 2: The block size is 2MB. You end up with X/2 full blocks, and then Y + X/2 empty blocks after that until more transactions are sent.
Either way, the block chain is the same size in terms of MB. The thing that takes up space on the blockchain is transactions. If the same number of transactions are sent, how could the 2MB chain be bigger?
@_date: 2019-07-02 15:12:49
It isn't the same amount of blocks. The 2MB chain would have half as many blocks as the current one, but they would all be double the size. Hence the blockchain would be the same size. The difficulty has nothing to do with how many transactions are allowed to fit into one block.
The 2MB chain would only be bigger if you think that having lower fees and faster confirm times would encourage more people to use bitcoin. Which is surely the thing we want...

I agree mostly, but where are you getting “hundreds of terabytes” from? The blockchain isn’t even 0.2 terabytes after 10 years. It doesn’t grow exponentially, it grows linearly at a rate of 1MB per 10 minutes. That’s 1TB per 19 years, assuming all blocks are full.

The user sets the fee. You can't say that any type of transaction is "cheaper" then any other.
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:52:50
Transactions cost whatever the user wants. You can say that SegWit transactions are typically smaller and thus for the same satoshi amount per byte, they will be cheaper. But without that qualifier it's a meaningless statement. Miners still choose the transactions with the biggest fees to mine, so you are putting yourself at a disadvantage with a lower fee.
@_date: 2019-06-17 15:54:28
So do I.

Link? I live here and have never heard anyone talk about BCH outside of the bitcoin meetup.
@_date: 2019-06-28 09:40:47
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:21:35
But you can still set the fee to whatever you want, and miners will still choose the most expensive transactions. Your transaction can be as cheap as you want - doesn't mean anyone has to mine it.
@_date: 2019-06-24 22:27:49
To be fair it does the same thing with BCH too.
@_date: 2019-06-28 10:17:38
$4 is a very high fee that I'm pretty sure isn't necessary with current congestion levels.
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:41:11


No, they don’t. It’s an NP-complete 0-1 knapsack problem. It isn’t simple as that. I know this because I had to write an algorithm to do it as a screener question for a programmer position at a crypto exchange.
The fee is only 65% reduced if the user chooses that. They don’t have to. You could pay 65% less for a non-SegWit transaction if you wanted. There is no concept of “transactions being cheaper”; that is misleading - transactions have no set cost and that’s a crucial difference between bitcoin and traditional payment methods. There is only a concept of you having more leeway to set a lower fee for the same likely confirmation time with a SegWit transaction. If time isn’t important to you, you can set that same low fee now for a non-SegWit transaction. It’s important to understand this.
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:11:43
You don’t understand how miners choose transactions, nor did you realise that fees are set by users.
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:34:34
How do BTC's fees impact you guys?
@_date: 2019-06-13 07:09:03
It doesn't. That isn't how it works. If everyone in the world stopped buying bitcoin right now, the price would remain exactly the same.
