I'm really starting to dislike bitcoin as time goes on lol.
Due to the limited capacity of the network it's literally just becoming utterly slow causing more frustration than actual confort and efficiency.

Yes I used VIABTC accelarator and it got 2 confirmations a minute after I used it.
Went 2 hours without a single confirmation so I was a bit scared since the fee was quite alright.

Is there any way to "unlink" these so the transaction gets confirmed without the unconfirmed input having to be confirmed? Like using a transaction accelerator? Or will the btc network still refuse confirming it?

Haha I understand that it may seem like that but I'm pretty sure double spending attacks are mostly impossible now anyway no? Ofcourse in case of scams it could still work but when it comes to actual autoshops and services I'm convinced all of those require atleast 1 confirmation no?
Anyway thanks for your reply :D

butthurt much?
I think I can choose whether to like bitcoin or not?
My credit card payments are instant, and don't care much about anonymity.

Technically you can control this by choosing a far higher fee for one of the transactions no?
Also, broadcasting these transactions to 2 different broadcasters and nodes would mean you'd have to broadcast the exact same raw transaction hash right?

I see it as a plug and play thing. I prefer not to wait 10 minutes either for a loading screen when iI start up a game. Same goes with online poker.

Oh that sounds good.
Can this be done with an electrum wallet? And yeah I read a thing or two about a "race attack", that's what you mean I suppose with 2 different addresses?
I appreciate the solid explanation!
EDIT: Also, you mentioned that I don't have to have the funds for both transactions but I need the funds for the new fee right?

So does this mean my money won't actually get confirmed?
Or how does this work exactly?
im personally not that knowledgable about these things.

This is what I mean with mixed opinions, no clue what the actual answer is now lol.
Just sent a transaction of $3 with a fee of 12 satoshis and I'll keep tabs on it to see what happens to it over time :P

I see, what would you consider "a long time"? Since I found some articles stating that it would take 1-7 days for the bitcoin network to delete unconfirmed transactions.
However that seems like quite a short amount of time lol
@_date: 2018-12-27 15:14:48
So technically if you would get your own personal node and broadcast a transaction to it, you could set it so it gets deleted after being unconfirmed for 10 minutes? Or doesn't it go into those extremes?
