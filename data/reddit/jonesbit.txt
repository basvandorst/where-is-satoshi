Absolutely, it only takes a few minutes to prepare a multi million dollar bankruptcy filing. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:28:02
All of you who believe courts are bastions for the proper handling of situations like this have obviously never been around a bankruptcy proceeding. It is a shitshow and a legal system money grab by all involved in the industry that is bankruptcy law. 
You want this company to figure out a logical way forward. You do not want a bankruptcy.

Zane can't say this but understand that the scale of this theft makes it almost certainly impossible for them to "reverse such problems". We are all going to lose. Let them figure it out and then judge how they are handling it.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:50:28
I don't pretend to know the legality of what you are doing, but if Bitfinex survives this shitstorm it could turn out to be a long run positive example of how to handle a similar situation.
I hate the realities of the bankruptcy process because it is a massive money grab for the legal profession. I support any effort to avoid that process if possible.

Are you clear to stop asking this question? Nearly all of your assumptions are wrong.
It would be nice if you would just delete this and read up a lot on how leverage works at Bitfinex and what they have already done regarding settling margin positions at pre closure prices.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:31:19
People with nothing but virtual $'s sitting in their Bfx account are participating in your loss. How do you think they feel (I am not one, by the way, but I had no exposure to btc)?
IMO, finex is taking the calculated risk that reducing the loss to as small a % as possible for all customers is the way to limit the lawsuits and give the exchange a chance to recover. Simple as that.
We all take a rather large risk with these exchanges and we are paying.
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:52:20
No offense but there is really no point asking this. I personally believe it is extremely likely these guys are despondent over this situation and will be working all hours possible to fix it as best they can.

Wow, how impressive of you. I wanna be more like you.
@_date: 2016-08-07 06:34:40


Bingo, they are a liability. Now what did you call customer accounts at Bitfinex in your OP??


You are turning this into an argument, not me.
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:19:31
I obviously can't give you anything specific, but my point is the BTC you loaned is probably, in whole or in part, gone from Bitfinex's control (through no fault of your own) so I have to assume you are not going to be whole in this mess. I'm sorry. I had no Bitcoin on the exchange but am still expecting to lose a lot, so I certainly sympathize.
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:36:11
With most coming here trying to figure this out and make important decisions, you making statements of fact with no basis is not helpful at all IMO. So why do it?
There were a large number of addresses hacked, not one or two. They have posted a list of relevant addresses elsewhere in reddit.

I think you are absolutely correct here, but I also think the discussion is very worthwhile so I'm glad you guys are having it.
These crypto exchanges are different animals because they handle all the duties that are typically handled by numerous different entities in a typical regulated exchange environment.

@_date: 2016-08-05 01:11:47
We disagree on their legal insolvency. I don't think they are set up in a way that makes them liable for the losses, but that would (will?) have to be decided in the courts.
@_date: 2016-08-04 20:31:53
This matches my sentiment pretty near exactly. Thanks for posting it. I wish you would put some form of this under its own heading.
@_date: 2016-08-04 06:44:40
I pretty clearly said "in many cases". It was luck in my case. If the hack had happened two weeks ago, I likely would have lost a lot of Bitcoin. I happened to have no Bitcoin at Bitfinex as of this week when the hack happened.

I completely appreciate and share your concern. But if you just click and read his constant responses you will get just about any question answered to the extent he can answer it at this time.

@_date: 2016-08-07 04:35:00
I have now listened to the majority of his comments. I draw none of the negative conclusions about him from this particular audio that you or do. 
He is absolutely correct in saying some people don't know how to take a loss in trading. They are common in the markets. Also, it is important to understand his audience here. This is a group of Whaleclub traders who trade A LOT. His frankness here has a lot to do with the fact that he knows his audience well.
To be clear, this audio is a session in which he was answering complaints about issues with the Bitfinex platform long before this recent theft. He actually comes across well to me and I appreciate you posting the audio, although I doubt that is what you wanted me to conclude.
I encourage others to listen to the entire audio to get a feel for one of the players at Bitfinex. Opinions will differ.
@_date: 2016-08-06 02:43:47
You are playing in the crypto world, but when the shit hits the fan you want gov oversight to step in. You're probably not equipped for this world, just accept it.
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:06:44
I'm guessing you don't have any real world experience with business bankruptcy and its intricacies and realities. Suffice to say, no one decides they are insolvent 1 day after an event like this. Many questions have to be answered. One of them that is being ignored by those who lost Bitcoin (which I understand) is that the customers who didn't hold bitcoins at the time of the hack (acknowledging this was pure luck in many cases) have rights as well and have to be handled properly by Bitfinex. It is quite possible that legally these customers have a priority right in their account balances. We just don't know yet.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:45:20
I don't know, but what has been in my mind since this announcement is that the best players in this game seem to be on the Dark Side.
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:00:53
I didn't say I was a CPA to brag, I was just trying to point out that I am not just guessing here.
You obviously understand that the accounts would be a liability to Bitfinex and the assets transferred which populate those accounts are shown as an asset on Bitfinex's balance sheet which have a claim against them from the liability customer accounts. I think your OP was unclear on that, but you obviously understand it.
Now with that said, until we actually see a Bitfinex financial stmt, I have no idea if they may have had some other method of accounting for this since they have insisted the Bitcoin were in segregated accounts. This made me think early on that they would claim no responsibility for the losses, but that has not been the case.

A bank controls my access to the funds in my checking account at all times, but that account is certainly not considered an asset of the bank. It is actually a liability and could not be used to pay creditors in a bankruptcy.

They settled all margin positions at the asset prices posted just prior to the exchange halt so nobody got rich from the later drop off shorting on margin.
Leverage limit was 3.3x. Even with their massive security flaw they were never a bucket shop for degenerate gamblers.

No, it is not that simple and I am pointing this out for anyone who reads your oversimplification, not for you.
Just to point out the major flaw in your logic. Customer balances are not "their" assets.
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:46:57
I would focus on your last paragraph. A lot of people have a lot bigger problems than you do and we are going to be dependent on Bitfinex if we get anything back. It is what it is.

While in theory I generally agree with you about staying out of the glacial mess and money grab that is bankruptcy, you have an inaccuracy in this statement that hurts the credibility of your argument. I will point it out...


The exact opposite is actually true in accounting terms.
EDITED to add a suggested clarification of the paragraph mentioned based on discussion with OP, he wasn't wrong, but I thought it was a bit confusing. Take it for what it's worth ...
"Some of you may be thinking that you are entitled to all your funds, because your BTC were not hacked or because you were holding ETH or USD or ETC or LTC. Well, that doesn't really matter, because the reality is that $70 million worth of those various assets under Bitfinex's control were stolen, and that theft makes it impossible for Bitfinex to satisfy the liabilities our accounts represent to Bitfinex. This means in a legal resolution, you will just become a creditor among many other creditors, and you won't be first in line to be paid in the court process."
@_date: 2016-08-07 06:27:17
I am a CPA.
I am not trying to be an ass, I was just trying to suggest you might want to change an error in your post.
If I did a personal financial statement, my BFX account would be an asset on that statement.
In BFX's financial statements they are certainly not showing customer accounts as assets because they are not.
This has nothing to do with how a court might look at these things in a liquidation, but your statement I highlighted is simply incorrect. Do what you will with that info.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:01:34

At this point nobody outside of the company can confirm anything of the sort and the opinions you get here are probably worth what you are paying for them. I have non Bitcoin balances at finex and am expecting the worst and hoping for better.
I am also imaging much pain and suffering for the criminals who did    this. Bitfinex's obvious F up aside, we as a crypto community need to be more united in efforts to expose these criminals to the retribution they earn.

If people are just waking up to the fact they may lose everything they had at Bitfinex then I feel for them. I have been reading Zane's answers since this started and it became pretty clear early on that it was possible for me to lose all I had with them and I have no Bitcoin position. It is still possible. They have to follow the best legal path they can based on their agreement with their users. Do you want Zane to tell you something that isn't true to make you feel better?
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:24:56
When you say the "same exact thing happened with MtGox" you lose credibility. People are going to lose a lot of money, yes, but Gox was a masterclass in how NOT to do everything. These guys are trying and have a lot more skill. That said, it is still very much in doubt whether or not the outcome will be better.
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:04:18
You're doing fine Zane. A lot of us who can control our emotions understand the difficulty of what you and your co-workers are trying to solve.
That said, a lot of us are giving you guys a pass for now. In my case for one, that pass is contingent on the expectation that what you come up with will be pretty damn logical. Also, that it will give the company a chance to continue while at the same time giving customers some hope of participating in a recovery of their funds over the long term. If you guys are going to save your company that has to happen. Your level of communication has been appropriate to me thus far, but the bar is high for you guys to come up with something that works. You owe us that for the massive mistake that was made.
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:30:00

You just made the case that they are liabilities to Bitfinex, which is all I was trying to point out in my first post. Whether you believe I am a CPA or not (which I am) has nothing to do with the fact that your original post had an error.
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:33:02
I think the complexity the theft caused in situations like yours is a large part of why they are taking so long to even open customers up to looking at their balances. The theft throws a huge wrench into a system that isn't really set up to contemplate how to handle such a theft. They are going to need to be able to explain why your account is showing what it is showing in all kinds of scenarios and then start discussing how they might "socialize" the losses. I am sure they are getting bundles of legal advice on how to go forward even if they aren't insolvent at this point.
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:05:25
Zane, in the past when the site has gone down you guys have been reasonable in not calling margin positions quickly upon restarting trading. 
Please consider this again in this situation. A number of folks, myself included, have had major moves against existing positions as a direct result of the market turmoil caused by Bitfinex (no other way to say it at this point).
I hope you will consider being reasonable in this instance as mass margin calls would only increase an already volatile situation.
I also want to say that I am very sympathetic to the many who have likely lost a lot today.
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:02:53

I will speculate and offer one piece of advice (which is probably worth what you are paying for it).
Speculation: One bitcoin will be worth north of $10,000 USD within 7 years.
Advice: Be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy. In other words, if you believed in Bitcoin 1, 2 or 3 years ago, it has only gotten better as a technology and a currency. The current price is a gift. You should be buying as much of it for yourself as is possible and/or prudent.

It isn't real difficult. A Ponzi is a scheme which pays returns to its investors from new capital obtained from other investors rather than from profits of the enterprise.

I continue to be lost as to what you are arguing. The price at which GBTC trades is set every day in an open, fair market by participants in that market.
I actually sold GBTC at $75 after a very nice profit when Bitcoin was around $450 because I was uncomfortable with the large premium. That turned out to be a bad decision for my wallet. I own a material amount of Bitcoin directly, but wanted some exposure in a retirement fund and GBTC was the only horse in town (thus making their 2% fee seem pretty reasonable to me since they are the only ones who have gotten that job done thus far, after all, they are in it to make money).
You seem to think it is the fault of the creators that participants in a market have bid the premium of GBTC to levels some find ridiculous. It is a free market! If you don't like the premium, don't invest. If you don't understand what you are buying and you lose money, that is on you, no one else. What you or I think is good or not good, in this case, makes no freakin difference.
@_date: 2016-06-26 15:28:38
I think you missed my main point. A lot of people have the majority of whatever investment funds they have tied up in tax deferred accounts. If they want to invest in something, they have to do it in those accounts. If they want to invest in Bitcoin, there is only one vehicle right now, GBTC. Yes the premium is obscene (especially as of Friday), but it is set in the free market, buyer beware as always.

I think you had little short interest in it after the recent rocket ride, but it increased tremendously today. Those shorts covering for profits are likely holding it up a bit.
I am one of them and I am looking for south of $10 before I cover.

To be fair, not sure they were completely aware of that at the time of this convo. It was just happening.

There is no evidence yet that she has a serious skill beyond beauty. Time will tell I guess.

This is a naive comment. Investment vehicles overseen by the SEC and highly paid executives routinely trade at outrageous prices compared to their underlying value. This is how free markets work. If an asset is scarce, and ways to hold a BTC proxy in a tax deferred account are scarce, then it will trade at a premium.
I personally don't consider the premium investors are willing to for GBTC, when it is in an uptrend, nearly as long term stupid as folks paying 550 times earnings and 25 times book value for the stock of an already massive company. But many of the largest and "smartest" investors in the world own AMZN.

Exactly! And that role is all about "appearing" to be knowledgeable and in control. This was the opposite of that, so she threatens to release the hounds if they don't retract the damage she did to herself.

Let's just agree to disagree. I respect your moral sensibilities, but I don't think you live with enough toes in the real world.

If that girl is anything other than a stripper in the South, it's a real waste of potential.

Article leaves a lot of things open to interpretation. The bank is worried they could be on the hook for fraud as she quickly empties her account.
Not a fan of banks in general but this doesn't smell right. Folks don't normally need lawsuit proceeds from a tragedy to feed their children.

His continued involvement with Jeff Berwick events was enough for me to write him off as at best naive and more likely untrustworthy a while ago.

Americans put way too much emphasis on what's happening in America in regards to Bitcoin price changes. When America really gets interested we will be well into the 4 figure price range per coin.

GBTC is not really stagnant. Much more volatile than btc on a percentage basis. Just seems to be letting go of the ridiculous premium it traded at for a period of time. It was up about 3 today when btc was up 30 so pretty in line. Tomorrow will be interesting.

This is really incredible to me. Should be a major embarrassment. Why isn't it?
