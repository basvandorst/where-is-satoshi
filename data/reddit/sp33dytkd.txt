People are accumulating bitcoin... have been at 7-14k because they thought it was going onto a bull run to 20k. People get too wrapped up in emotion and don't trade intelligently ie. looking left at previous events, because it will play out and unfold the same way. Down to 3k. Will remember this comment and tag you in 10 months to remind you!

You're actually stupid haha its laughable. Look into Stock to Reward Ratio. That is why gold is worth so much and has a stable market value, whereas something scarce like platinum could never be. Whenever bitcoin halves, it increases its stock to flow ratio by 2x, hence making it worth exponentially more.

Edit: Once the halving takes place, yes you are correct, we won't see $3,000. But this is a bear market occurring before bitcoin halves...

bitcoin literally just entered a bear market and will be in one for 6 months to 1 year. Can expect it to go down to below 3k. If you are smart and own bitcoin, you'd sell it now and buy back in to double your holdings before it blasts off to 120k in 2021, 1 year after its halving.
bear market occurs when:
50 day ema crosses below 200 day ema, price closes below the 21 week exponential moving average, and when the 5 week ema crosses below the 20 week ema. All of which have occurred.
