bcash is the opposite of all those bullet points.

Just use legacy address on your Nano
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:15:37
Then don’t own your coin and risk loosing it. Rather have it stuck in my Nano legacy address than in an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:15:42
You're blinded.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:44:11
I also sent money via SEPA to Coinbase from a UK account. Smooth and was there quickly, you've probably put in the wrong details.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:08:54
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:18:46
Donated to charity, where's the harm?
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:47:34
I played around with myself
@_date: 2018-10-26 13:51:17
Best to steer clear of P2P market places, use Coinbase Pro, Binance etc...
I've been using Revolut for crypto for 3 years now and never had any problem, because I don't use P2P services.
@_date: 2018-10-26 13:50:23
Don't spread FUD, I saw your post and a user mentioned that the reason Revolut suspended your account could of been because the money you were sent was used in illegal matters. Not your fault, not Revolut's fault, not LocalBitcoins fault.
@_date: 2018-06-28 14:06:55
Hey, I think I know your Revolut issue. You need to go to "more" in the bottom right corner. "profile" top right. Then "account details" and then make sure an EUR account is active.
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:40:13
Oh behave you pillock.
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:14:31
It’s for Etorro, I’ve said it before. Rather it be Coinbase than Etorro
@_date: 2018-06-28 14:18:31
No problem, hope that sorts it!
@_date: 2018-06-14 13:14:24
Yeah, buy the coins...
@_date: 2018-06-06 17:37:02
Coinbase isn’t Etorro
@_date: 2019-10-07 11:43:34
Sounds like a lot of trouble for $300 worth of crypto
@_date: 2018-06-18 06:50:23
This is the sort of adverts us Londoners want to see, not the shitty Etoro ones
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:34:19
Coinbase. Paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:37:24
No lol
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:28:32
It did hit 10k. You’re about 10 hours late
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:49:42
Thanks for the message but sadly I'd already done the transfer using the above method. Could you direct me on how to get the keys out of Copay?
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:14:37
Hardware wallets are pointless in my opinion, just paper wallet and keep it safe
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:42:10
Yeah I'd sell bro....
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:40:33
Thanks for this, opened a Kraken account today, will not be using.
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:16:29
No likely between Copay and Bread unfortunately
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:43:08
Who are these "people" you speak of? I know no one like this.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:38:36
Really want one of these just can't justify 75 euros
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:36:01
lmao stupid, don't put the majority of your money into bitcoin, or do it, helps us all
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:21:19
Yeah Litecoin
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:33:46
He didn’t mean it as in the stock market. I read it differently to you, lol
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:39:29
We know
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:33:12
If you can’t win an argument with your dad who is clearly uneducated (no offence) in Bitcoin then I’d go away and do some reading up before putting anymore money in it
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:59:17
Not his fault the price of Bitcoin rose 17 fold.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:49:54
100% yes
@_date: 2017-11-09 09:50:04
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:44:15
BTC is featured on the front page of BBG terminals at least 4 times a week
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:45:31
I really want a TicrThing but cannot justifiy the price.
Not aware of anything else sadly.
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:22:16
Ahh many thanks, will give that a try
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:51:31
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:04:34
This, and me pls
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:42:21
Research more, BTC price is volatile and especially with this fork the price could plummet
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:51:30
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:33:21
There isn't lol, you could have the whole 16,697,037
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:16:09
It already happened at 8am GMT. Traded @ $10,006
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:16:28
Fundamentals that apply to fiat currency pairs do not apply to BTC. No bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:35:59
Haven’t even looked at the link but I very much doubt Satoshi Nakamoto has released this
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:35:11
I'm sure it would be fine, no need to get a second opinion. CEX are very reputable.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:14:27
Doesn't do anything, just adds to the daily trans amount
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:35:04
nah man
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:22:04
Link not working.
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:13:07
You said it all in the first line.


@_date: 2017-11-27 05:41:27
There is nothing “normal” about Bitcoin����
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:34:26
Nice try but incorrect.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:37:04
Ouch, "bought on Coinbase"
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:31:33
Think the highest traded price was $10,006 this morning (GMT) on CEX
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:05:43
Not heard of that show. And are what still relevant?
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:08:57
Yeah, used by every bank and 95% of voice brokers
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:40:01
Are you high?
@_date: 2019-04-05 11:05:02
Nice! Just signed up. Thanks
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:33:30
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:52:15
Link? Proof?
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:39:28
90eur after shipping...
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:22:55
Dumb and no need to tell us.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:00:42
lol, weak hands
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:52:00
Don't agree. How many times has Sterling "forked"?
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:54:04


There you go.
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:16:26
How is this a bad thing? I’d rather provide a slither of my computing power for a site to stay alive than be bombarded with ads
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:30:01
Or just stop paying fee's alltogether and use Revolut...
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:02:06
Just different opinions I guess, I see no problem with it and actively support JSEcoin
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:29:05
What's your wallet address?
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:37:59
Fun story, good luck
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:33:45
I remember reading another thread on here regarding Coinbase's insurance policy being quite flaky. There was a clause something along the lines that they only insure the coins which are held in the ONLINE wallet and not cold storage.
@_date: 2017-10-30 11:59:25
Not sure if I believe this.
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:21:16
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:23:21
Still don’t get the beef. You don’t ask for intrusive adverts that pop up and track you all around the internet. Giving up 10% of my PC WHILE browsing a site which needs the revenue is a no brainer for me
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:25:26
Lol what
@_date: 2017-10-26 09:26:37
All coins won't be mined in a few years...
@_date: 2017-10-27 06:19:43
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:02:52
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:35:56
What do you expect? Nearly 400k subscribers and near on 30 posts/hr. Course there will be duplicates
@_date: 2017-10-26 10:20:24
Correct but the current estimate for the last Bitcoin to be mined is in 2140.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:29:25
I'd store in a paper wallet, even with Authy if the exchange gets hit offline you're stuffed. No need to buy a hardware in my eyes
@_date: 2017-10-27 06:18:14
Says $ not BTC
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:33:57
But I get what you're saying
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:08:54
Great read, bravo
@_date: 2018-04-24 08:59:05
Wouldn't really say Bitcoin was inevitable... it just happened. Was a smart idea but was in no way "inevitable"
@_date: 2019-05-08 07:06:41
Esdupendo, thanks
