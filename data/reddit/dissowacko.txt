ok it did finally go through but now im trying to pay someone through coinpayments again...i used a lower fee tho because it was about $50 bucks less than the refund I got...I put it through a free txaccelerator about 50 times i was like a robot doing it over and over....but for the refund i actually put it through a paid fee txacelarator as well i paid $15 for that....bitcoin is really fucking slow now am I right? i dont really keep up to date with it but am i right? its slow now

Ok i hear it takes 24-48 hours to verify your debit card and or bank account....something about it sending two small charges to your bank to verify before you can add funds?
