I understand bitcoin but when I try to buy some from Coinbase, for example, they ask for proof of identity the fees are too much and the site keeps crashing so blockchain is an alternative I've been denied Bitcoin multiple times because they don't have anything to verify my card with my name otherwise I could use anyone's card and they'd have no idea until they look at their bank statement. They need proof that I'm using my credit card and not someone elses.

blockchain has a 3% fee if you use bank transfer it's free but can take a couple of days and trades in DKK USD GBP AND EUR
