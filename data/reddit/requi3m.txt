Getting your return accepted doesn't necessarily mean it is correct and follows all their rules. Your return might not survive an audit.
@_date: 2014-03-17 16:41:27
Well now they have heard of it. That's the point.

What a horrible time to cash that out. He would've gotten about 10k more if they'd cashed out a few weeks ago.

Libertarians don't believe that people should be able to steal from other people. And even an anarchist would probably argue that you should face consequences for stealing, just not necessarily from a government. The people saying you should be able to steal bitcoins are just crazy. It's weird how many upvotes they get though.

I think the ones calling this a scam to get the donation don't know who andreas even is. Andreas is smart enough to not be scammed. He's going to deliver it in person.

yeah they really need to train their customer service reps. They like to make shit up a lot.
@_date: 2014-02-01 03:10:52
I had the same experience. It took them 3-4 days to approve the order after initially denying I sent them payment. It has been my experience that their customer service doesn't have a fucking clue when it comes to bitcoin.

mt gox takes months to verify you... if they ever do at all.

Writes also degrade a SSD over time.

not the same thing, and that layout is completely useless.
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:27:59
I forged the address on my power bill (didn't match what was on my ID) and they accepted it. Not that I'd put anything in there after all their recent shenanigans. Sorry you're having trouble.

Governments can't subpoena information that isn't being logged. This article is blowing things out of proportion.

oh hey look it's a linux fanboy! So when did microsoft ban bitcoin? Oh that's right they didn't.
@_date: 2014-04-14 20:44:41


Of course not! Do some research on password hashing.
@_date: 2014-02-11 20:19:14
No we don't. Bitstamp is promising to fix it quickly. Gox hasn't been processing transactions for a very long time and hasn't given a timeframe of when it will be fixed. They also didn't blame the bitcoin protocol itself in an attempt to cause mass panic. Gox straight up lied, and bitstamp is telling the truth.

You should go tell your mommy someone swore on the internet and it hurt your feelings.
@_date: 2014-02-05 06:32:31
Actually it's not, sherlock.
@_date: 2014-02-11 20:17:59
Yeah I'm sure you're a perfect human being that's never made a mistake in his life. Grow up.
@_date: 2014-01-13 04:09:59
stop using paypal you moron
@_date: 2014-02-03 03:41:03
I still don't understand. What have they gained by getting rid of some bitcoin? How does getting rid of some bitcoin distribute their currency?
@_date: 2014-01-29 05:37:52
don't let the doorknob impale your asshole on the way out

It's not illegal for me to give someone money if they tell me they're going to use it for something illegal.
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:44:59
not my problem. I'm not doing anything illegal.

I think Andreas is smarter than you give him credit for. I doubt he'd just send it to some guy over the internet without first meeting him in person.

When asked what his IQ was, Stephen Hawking said "I have no idea. People who boast about their IQ are losers"
What we do know is that he keeps changing his story and has brought the value of bitcoin down with his lies and mismanagement of his company. That's reason enough to hate him.

You should have paid the miniscule fee if you wanted the payment to happen quickly.
@_date: 2014-03-09 05:58:02
yeah it's almost like it was written by someone to whom english was a second language... oh wait it was.
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:03:54
Indeed that's exactly how it would go after the prosecutor submits no evidence other than "he's got the same name."
@_date: 2014-04-14 20:43:44
It's highly unlikely they're sending your password in plaintext. They're more likely using a hashing algorithm for the password.
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:41:13
Wow what a dangerous precedent. If I buy something, and then someone uses the money I gave them for an illegal purpose, I can get in trouble? That's fuckin ridiculous.
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:04:56
Well will you morons get it through your thick skulls that libertarians are not anarchists?
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:14:53
This gets debunked every time one of you idiots posts this. When will you get this through your thick fucking skulls? Free market doesn't mean you can break laws and steal from people, unless you live in nigeria. Most of us live in civilized countries with laws that protect people from crap like this. If you think your country's laws don't apply to bitcoin transactions and contractual obligations then you're wrong.

if tigerdirect is saying they didn't get it then bitpay will refund you your bitcoin

bitcoin is real money
