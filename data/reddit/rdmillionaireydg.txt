It's bullshit that this is the second question in a row asking for information, the entire purpose of this entire conversation, and people are getting down voted for it. Not sure what to make of that, but definitely confirms my biases about people in this sub.

What market? The market predictions for the crypto near 2 trillion by the end of 2018 by most estimates I read. You go deeper mate. Bitcoin will be replaced by the better coins as a store of value. No one wants to hold one of each type of bitcoin just to get a taste of the other coins features. Bells and whistles run the (western) world, in case you didn't notice.  
Stop emotionally defending your currency and start thinking about an exit plan.

What do you mean by my shitcoin? I don't hold any bitcoins or bitcoin knockoffs.
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:27:22
I have. It's more ground breaking than bitcoin.
It's funny how you guys agree that there are all these things that are not as good about bitcoin as  VTC which is already asic resistant and adjusts it's blocks every block, and improves upon all the other stats of bitcoin, doing exactly what bitcoin does but better, and you say it'll always be king.

Bitcoin is the shit coin buddy.
Edit: Slower than other currencies, more expensive to use, power struggles all over the place, many 'forks' because the original is just absolute shit, fairly centralized - esp when it comes to mining, and will absolutely trade price tags with another currency like LTC or VTC once their integrations into ATMs and businesses and such picks up momentum. Only reason anyone even knows of BTC is because it was the first.

But... I'm not trolling... 
Also forgot to add to the original list, your block difficulty only resets after 2100 blocks. Another shit aspect that other currency coins to better.

I listed many reasons why bitcoin is shit, the forks are just part of it. 
It's like saying the original Nike is shit, so why would the knockoffs be any better? Buy Adidas.
You guys are really emotional about this though so I'll drop it.

You're right. BecauSe we're strictly talking about code so that your community can save face. 
You of course have nothing to say about my concrete arguments and just plain facts. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:09:49
Yea, bitcoin is already a scam, why not make a coin that's a scam with it's own name. It'll go undetected for longer.
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:44:56
Aight mate. I listed at least 5 ways that almost all new 'stores of value'  are better (I forgot stealth addresses and actual privacy, there are two more right there). 
Your whole argument is 'nah-uh bitcoin wuz here firstest! This is me and my friends Reddit go away mean fact man.' Like, literally. It's childish. Just respond to the facts and we'll have a nice conversation. 
Edit: If you think the market has finished deciding you don't know what the market is. It hasn't even arrived yet in this industry!
