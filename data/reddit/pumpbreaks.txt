Erm? Thats sound to me you have a problem understanding what it is, to say knowone underatand is quite funny and it made me chuckle, at least the core lead dev understands it ?

Bfl make ideas up and post them as final they then offer pre orders these pre orders are now over 45 days old thus much harder to refund using paypal, or the coins are worth alot more most likey nice gamble.

Amazon needs bitcoin, like bitcoin needs amazon, overstock have took the gamble so you should too. 
If you use coinbase there is no $ risk at all... 100% 0, the bitcoins are coverted to $ instantlly.
Overstock think they might increase there sales by 1%, surely that is something you cant pass up, you must get bonuses.

We can hold out a 1 or so more cant we? New people in the game, even faster mining equipment. Mtgox made false moves and got knock of the top, so can they. What happens if china turns on there warehouse. We need to he carefull of this but people will react.&gt;There is a ton of merit in what you are saying.  I think with exponential technologies we have a really hard time understanding and grasping the rate of change to information technologies.

That all good sending a few letters thats not going to affect them much, i would start buy emailing them every 5 mintues with a hunred or so emails that you legal own or what ever, send them 15 boxes of 200 or so letters per day demanding they dont blacklist you the day of the receipt the letter, this way you will activly be costing them a cost for them to keep the blacklist withstanding.

Pratice with small amounts, make sure you understand paper wallets fully e.g. how to make them securly, how to load them safely and to redeem then safely. When you can do all that, it will feel comfortable to accept the bitcoins. 2 sig wallet is probs best

I think this is a nice idea for a new coin, but not bitcoin. 
Dont need to over conplicate things, smart miners would plan for the havlfing, how you plan they going to work out profits from that? Thinking about it more miners would get less profits, if they miss 10 blocks, its less reward as for now its none. Plus 2016 theres only going to be smart miners around. Thanks for coming up with ideas though.

You havent addressed anything at all.


You didnt say sorry 1 time 


The only "misstake" you have done is buying ferraris.  


We havent forgiven you for amazon, bestbuy or the $20 fake floor. 


You cant fix this its over


Close the door now before you go to jail


It wasnt an investment it was a ponzi

Think people are forgetting how large 11% increase is. This fits into the difficulty/profitbilty agument. Yes if they were to put that amount of power right now they could do a 51% attack but if i switch on my miner and so do another few thousand it soon becomes a cat and mouse race,
 not to mention all the other competing companys KNC??? Not worried period.
