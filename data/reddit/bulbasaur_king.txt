Someone beat you to it buddy, sorry:( 
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:13:11
And this is why we can't have nice discussions.
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:53:55
Right indeed! I'm sure you got more to think about! 
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:55:21
Lol just like the Bitcointalk forum? No thanks, I'm never donating again after that nonsense. 
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:29:27
Is that illegal? Sorry for noob questions but it seems too good to be true
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:33:58
So are you okay with paying high fees? Do you think some fees should be free? Bitcoin is supposed to be an electronic cash system. Not really cash right now huh? I've never heard someone argue against poor people using the coin and for high fees..
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:47:59
How does that work out for you? I would be scared to let an app do that much trading D;
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:11:47
Lol okay. I've donated to the devs and will continue to when I can and just suggested that others do to? I want Lightning out just like everyone. Instead of bashing, provide some facts for where I am wrong. Right now, in its current state, bitcoin isn't doing well compared to others. I am welcome to debate just bring facts
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:49:17
That's called human trafficking and highly illegal
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:19:39
Yupp! Just like the whitepaper says! High fees, none should be free! Oh wait... Satoshi said that fees should be cheapo and some should even be free! Ever hear of a store off value that can drop 20% in a day? Me neither. Ever hear of a currency that costs $15-45 to send to somebody else? Me neither. Bitcoin is broken right now. It is a peer to peer electronic cash system. Biggest words in the whitepaper. High fees mean that poor people can't use it. How do we talk shit about banks and the 1% when half of the bitcoin community is just about HODL? How is bitcoin going to help those I  Africa? Please,  don't lie about Bitcoin not being broken,  I lovr bitcoin and want it to succeed but there has to be changes and soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:17:01
Okay so we can't have an intelligent conversation, Okay:)
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:20:54
Thanks man, everyone in said nothing close to this. Thanks for not telling me to not ask questions here and actually giving me feedback!
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:09:13
Check for more info. I'm in no way a bch shill but do try to be in the middle as possible. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:47:09
Wu-tang is for the children!
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:27:06
Thanks mate!
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:52:06
Yea people are too dumb to understand the difference between ethereum and ethereum classic too. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:17:46
Yea I'm not down to transfer my bitcoin and pay $15 in fees WITH a SegWit address. I'd rather wait
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:10:11
Because we are getting exposure to millions of people every day now by being on mainstream media outlets. I have donated to the developers of BTC and want bitcoin to succeed. Just am worried because we are not that useful right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:00:05
Cate to share why? Seems that your the person who wouldn't even turn the wheel when the car is going to a brick wall
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:16:16
That's why I asked here for more clarification. Everyone over there was just saying how corrupt blockstream is. Getting feedback for from both sides is how people should go about it not close your ears to a group you don't agree with. When I asked here I got a detailed response^^ from someone. Don't send people away just cuz they asked a question they weren't sure about :/
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:14:37
It'll be showing the faster transaction times and lowers fees of BCH vs BTC. Apparently someone created a BCH and BTC wallet where the person deposited $5 increments 20 times (equally $100) to show how a merchant would use it selling goods. Anyone who knows the networks know that BCH will look a lot better than BTC to people who are watching
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:49:15
Read the white paper man. Satoshi said himself fees should be low and some even should be free. You wont convince anyone who reads the white oaper that fees should be higher than pennies. It's supposed to be usable to people in Africa but it's not. As someone else said in this thread if Bitcoin Cash had bitcoins volume it's 8mb would go through our 135,000 backlog in 1.5 hours rather than Bitcoins current 12 hours.
Bigger blocks means less fees but more transactions. Biggest words in Bitcoins whitepaper is P2P Electronic Cash system. Which means it should be able to be used for small transactions with low fees, or else we couldn't use it as cash. Off chain scaling? Not in the whitepaper. Core isn't Bitcoin. Roger Ver isn't Bitcoin. Bitcoin is whatever closely resembles the whitepaper created by Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:44:30
So what's the difference? Does one out perform the other right now? Jc....
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:27:18
That's the solution to everyday use of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:34:11
Okay bud:) issue is still there because not everyone can do 10 satoshi a tx. Tried with Ledger S right now and the confirmation wait time on 10 Satoshis is ridiculous lol
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:46:23
And it's a garbage idea to start using tabs in order to avoid high fees while we are waiting for LN. Mind you this is right after he said to just use a credit card LOL
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:08:23
Sorry man, Bitcoin is supposed to be a currency and if poor people can't use a currency then the holders of BTC will be the new 1%. Bitcoin is pretty useless compared to others right now and it's really obvious... Yes the whitepaper isn't a bible but you get rid of the low fees, getting rid of it being used as cash, and adding off chain support. Makes BTC look like another project that can have a whitepaper of its own.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:15:22
That lady link had an amazing explanation of things thanks! Ask the noe reason to support the developers to get LN out! 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:56:42
If you aren't going by the whitepaper for bitcoin, why not fork and create the coin you want because if you look at Bitcoin, then the whitepaper or vis versa, you can see it's not the same, so why call it the same? Why not make another whitepaper with details that describe off chain solutions while glorifying high fees? That will get a lot of people's attention! Whitepaper doesn't = Bitcoin. Name any other currency that doesn't coincide with the whitepaper. I'll wait..
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:22:22
Sucks when that's what the service provider is asking for and I can't do a custom fee just to go to another wallet where I can add custom fees. And when you try to move over 10k don't even get me started 
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:30:24
Then you should worry because it correlates with BTC quite a bit
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:01:05
Really? A little anecdotal. If people followed their advice they would've bought at $600 when there was a post at the top of the sub saying  "remember wishing you bought bitcoin at 600? Now's your chance" or something like that. If he followed that advice he would've made bank. I followed advice I got on here and lost money, does this mean this sub is shit? Other subs let the spam come and go cuz it'll be downvoted and never reach the top. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:59:59
What does it say about it being for transactions and not a store of value? What does it say about it having low fees? Cuz I'm very confused
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:02:40
Not saying mine will be more productive but it won't have the same people expressing the same ideas and that is productive in itself. Even if it is negative ideas they will express it differently because it's a different person.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:44:00
And the other points? I see the Vitalik talk but all I see is people talking shit about him nothing productive, so I made my own thread. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:20:55
I don't need a question though. I'm just expressing the trouble I've had trying to post here.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:16:08
So you think the same people on 10 hours ago have the exact same ideas as the people on now? Fine. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:18:49
I made a statement.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:05:32
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:24:23
Love how I get downvotes when I'm asking about the differences. It's like people don't want new comers to understand it something. I get that this question has probably been answered but not everyone has the time to scroll through reddit and find the answers :/ people in this sub are so quick to downvotes anything. Real friendly community ��
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:47:27
Really informative, thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:06:21
Not everyone preaches hodl, some people told me to dabble in trading bitcoin, selling at high buying low. Tried and failed a couple times. Now I hodl but still..
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:31:20
Ohhh sorry man. Well to start, before the difficulty adjustments I made a thread asking where I can find info regarding bitcoin vs bcash difficulty adjustment. Got deleted. Had to ask this sub where to find bitcoin DA then had to make another post in /btc to get bcashs D'S and compare them. Why couldn't I just ask about the two in one thread on one sub?
Vitalik threw shade at bitcoin by saying bcash is a true competitor and that theymos has too much censorship. I just wanted to read some opinions about it and hopefully not get a bunch of hate filled comments I saw on earlier posts about it.
How are things always an attack but people like Vitalik can see it's censorship. His ethereum gets attacked in the ethereum and ethereumtrader subs but it's not deleted (I know he doesn't control the subs). People say ethereum won't last, ethereum is bad compared to NEO, ethereum won't be able to overtake bitcoin and will be left behind for new tech etc. Etc. Downvotes all day but IT'S STILL UP. Calling it an attack doesn't make it an attack when people like me are just asking questions. I can get it cuz people spam and stuff but it sucks for people who just want to learn or conversate on reddit.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:55:56
That's what I was wondering, thanks! Like I said, I'm happy with where I bought and just saw the pending status in my bank account and thought that someone who isn't a HODLR like myself would be able to panic cancel lol

Thanks man I'm trying to be the most secure I am
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:09:57
Please tell me where I am ramming anything down anyone's  throat? I asked for a reply to show me how Roger was wrong and you got all agro on me. When somebody answers my question I always say thank you. I don't try to argue with anyone. Look at my post history. Every time I say thank you. One can be concerned with Bitcoin without being a troll and if I'm a troll then I must be the worst troll ever lol who ever heard of a troll who agrees and thanks somebody who actually put effort and thought in their reply? 
@_date: 2017-09-29 05:12:32
Just got one on Amazon, thanks for the help!
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:10:14
Because these are the same people telling us it's a power grab for companies and government but yet want government protection when they please. The worldwide group of voluntarily cooperating individuals is at a civil war right now so it's not that cooperative and someone who is seen as a leader in the community doing something like this can be seen as bad.
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:59:49
Just... stop? Buy half of what you are buying now and have cash for good and emergrncies.
@_date: 2017-09-23 05:38:12
Not really, I can fund it tho lol I'm a quick learner and patient as hell so I'd be willing to learn.

Thanks everyone who gave me replies with some solid info, learned a lot bout the market cap and whatnot. Even though I did get labeled as a conc
ern I s 0b0kpbpkpbtroll I still got good replies in there that adressed my post and refuted the claims by Ver. I'll still post here even though I'm RES tagged, no idea what that is, and ask questions when I'm curious about something bitcoin related. Again, thanks! 
@_date: 2018-02-11 00:26:10
I got this today and am looking everywhere for info about it :/
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:25:50
Didn't know that the Core team was for block size increase in the future. r/btc makes it seem like everyone here hates the idea of a block size increase, glad to know that isn't the case. Also didn't know that about just making your own coin,  like I said I don't know technical aspects that well and that's why I'm asking these types of things. Thanks for some clarification, I often see people on the different subs saying the exact opposite and it sucks that I'm labeled a concern troll for asking a question? Yes I've asked questions before but like I said in an early reply, I always say thank you! I read things on btc and ask the validity of it here to get the other sides ideas. Again, thanks my man
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:28:38

Sorry if it's a stupid question but what does this all mean?
@_date: 2018-02-18 02:49:41
Don't hold btc or bch but okay. Just wanting to get "the other side of the story" as Roger probably sees this as a win for BCH. Was asking for points to refute that they won this debate. You tried,  I guess.
@_date: 2017-09-29 04:47:41
So where should I store my coins reliably? Lol thanks for downvotes when I'm just new and trying to learn

I have the idea I need help with where to start. I need to create an app that can buy through an exchange like coinbase. Can't give out too many details but since I've never made an app i need help starting.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:09:12
Any reason why is wouldn't? Make a claim to stop all transactions with coinbase until further notice?
I might just try it to see if possible.
@_date: 2017-09-23 05:36:38
Lol I just need the option to buy bitcoin on the platform as it relates to something else

Did you sync your phone at one point to your laptop? If so do you still have that laptop? There are ways to get those pictures even if you don't have that phone. PM me for help, I had to do this for my notes
