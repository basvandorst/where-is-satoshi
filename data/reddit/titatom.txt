What do you mean you havent received it yet ? Where did you buy it ? Amazon ?
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:08:12
Hodl or cash out and put it in weedstocks

What fee did you use out of curiosity ? I want to get out of BTC asap and use Mycelium as well.
Cheers !

That seems safer. If its money you can loose and you are ready to gamble it to try to top off the downpayment. Why not, go right ahead my good sir.
The idea is to research the gamble enough that the odds are in your favour.

Bullshit. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Are losses in crypto tax deductible like other investments ?
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:37:41
Lol. +1

Uncashable piece of cap /s

High fees to transfert from wallet to exchange + long time to confirm. Then it seems like exchanges loose transfers or take a lomg time to send cash so you need to deal with that.
Not exactly as easy as gping to an atm or selling stock....so yeah, hard to cash out.

Not gonna give you shit but a three week hold in crypto is hardly an "investment". It's a gamble. Your miney not mine.
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:59:43
Not familiar enough with it to give you an opinion on that but if it's like any other investment, it can go both ways and you cant afford to loose the downpayment.
You say you are already in crypto with other funds. Why not just use some of the gains to top off the downpayment ?

Moving the BTC from my wallet is going to cost me 10% and take a week or two...thats fucking insane...I am cashing out at a loss now and putting it in weedstocks.
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:08:38
Yeah what an asshole. Doenvoted
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:14:33
Thats fucked. On Quadriga the transaction is instant as long as you have funds in the account.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:29:52
You are better off investing in weedstocks in my opinion. Once you have bitcoin it is hard to cash it out.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:31:31
to get you started
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:28:07
Exactly. Nothing stopping them. No exchange asks for sex when registering (thank god).
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:41:19
Is there an exchange that can cash out 5 million ? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:11:17
A bit less than 1% of my investment portfolio. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:42:13
I think you are fucked unfortunately. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:42:00
 Had I put it in Weedstocks like the rest of my savings last week I would be waaaay better off. 
Still made a profit on BTC so not even mad. Ill be back eventually. 
At this point I just want to see if I am able to cash out BTC. Seems to be a problem lately....and very unreliable. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:38:07
I am cashing out and putting my money elsewhere. Not because I dont believe but because cost opportunity is real and I can make a bettre profit elsewhere (not in crypto)  in the short term. 
Downvote away. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:58:10
All the best to you as well.
