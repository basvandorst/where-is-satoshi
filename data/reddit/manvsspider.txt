This "monetary inflation" term is really annoying and often confused with the typical definition of inflation (price inflation). I wish "monetary inflation" was given a more appropriate name like "money volume" or something.

Except that price inflation is the standard definition that everyone uses. Monetary inflation is a definition used by a subset of economists. Of course supply of money is very important variable and cause.

Inflation can also occur for other reasons.

I'm not sure where your definition comes from, but inflation is defined as the decrease of a currencies purchasing power, which is what happens when the value goes down, regardless of the reason.

Don't listen to this guy. His story is ridiculous. How can someone get $150k from his parents account without them noticing. Also, check his posting history, he's a new account spreading delusional nonsense. 
Also, if his story is true, he's an idiotic scumbag for stealing his parents money.

Right, I'm assuming that your parents have their money in a savings account, and unless your parents have some weird scheme set up, then there's no way you would be able to take out that much at once without them being notified.

Hmm, a credit card like thing actually sounds reasonable.
Thanks for the response. I'm not convinced quite yet, mainly since I keep considering the extreme circumstances of not having access to the bitcoin network.

I'm sorry but not everyone here wants to be under the radar and use bitcoin to avoid taxes. Plus for me bitcoin is a natural currency for the internet, but not for day to day life, and I want it to augment my national currency, not necessarily replace it.

That solution sounds a bit clunky and awkward, so we would still need a fiat currency for it to work?
Also regarding having Internet connection, unless I'm at home or at work, I don't have an Internet connection, so a huge infrastructure is going to have to be built before an online currency can become viable as a day to day currency.
