Seriously though, does anyone besides OP (preferably someone who can write in complete sentences and has a basic understanding of economics and history) want to explain this? The distribution of Bitcoin wealth is currently more unequal than the distribution of wealth in North Korea. Remember, the vast, vast majority of people in the world have no Bitcoin whatsoever. That level of inequality in an economic system has never benefited anyone but the very rich. How will Bitcoin be different?

Aren't they directly related?  was (I believe) responding to the questions "Can you tell me what the blocksize would have to be to scale that world to 7 billion people? How much would it cost to run a full node?"
As the physical technology scales (cheaper, larger storage, etc.), it gets easier and cheaper to answer those questions.

Because of the basic economic principle of leverage. The US govt can borrow money at incredibly cheap rates. If you could get a 1% loan that you could put in an investment that generated 10%, wouldn't you?

If I offered to loan you $1000 at 1% that you could invest for a 10% profit, or $2000 at 1% that you could invest for a 10% profit, which would you choose? Even though the 2nd option would technically mean you carry greater debt, it is clearly the superior option.
Debt isn't a bad thing. All that tells me is that the country's leverage is increasing.
