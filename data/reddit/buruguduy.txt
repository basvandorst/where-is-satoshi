Just wait. My transfers always go through in one day, except for one time. It took more than a week n they get backed up at times.

It will be very dependent on where you will send from and to where. The exchanges on both sides should have no to minimal fees. As of the moment, no cheap way I think. Not enough infrastructure...

Discounted reddit gold. I live on SEA so my choices are close to nil. Least I can do to support the btc economy I guess.
@_date: 2013-12-26 11:32:05
Around 15 to 30 mins. Yes you can

Tell your bank that you want to wire xxx usd dollars to bitstamps bank by debiting your cad account... :-)
@_date: 2013-12-27 06:17:30
Maybe not everything is about money?
@_date: 2013-11-13 09:41:43
Very far from the calamity area, but thanks for the concern. :-)

I withdrew 2.5 btc a few hours ago. Worked. I withdrew 4 btc two days ago also, worked also.

Don't think so. Bitcoin prices are being driven by speculation, not transactions. If you look at the forex market, prices are being driven by speculation. 90 percent of volume are done by speculators in fact. :-)
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:38:18
It holds true for anywhere.
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:56:11
I withdrew around that time, if not later
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:07:11
This is the answer you are looking for

Without proce changes,i think you would come out behind. Local bitcoin has a 1 percent charge plus the premium of the seller. Even if you go through btchina youd lose money since btc there is more expensive. :

I too wish they were big enough tonsift through all deposits even during peak times to crredit our account. But alas, growth is too fast and its hard to hire people and train. Very tough to run a business.thats growing too fast

You can try localbitcoins.com, but make sure you deal with trusted sellers. Only go for 5 percent premium max.

South East Asia. Philippines, specifically.
@_date: 2013-11-29 09:19:30
280btc? eh? that's so low
@_date: 2013-07-25 07:46:54
Why did I only see this now? Sad panda. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 11:48:47
Ah yes, but how about the premium of that seller? 
@_date: 2013-12-01 10:15:34
Dont you lose like 15 percent of your money due to localbitcoin and coinbase premium? 
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:41:09
The know your customers rule, or KYC. Look it up
@_date: 2013-08-14 06:00:58
Article was really bad and simplistic... 
@_date: 2013-11-13 04:47:24
Bitstamp. I'm from the Philippines
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:49:21
You don't have to buy a whole bitcoin. Buy .01 if you like
@_date: 2013-12-06 11:34:48
I've withdrawn 6 times, twice a day for the last 3 days. No issues at all.
@_date: 2013-11-21 09:52:39
Working well on my end. My international wire was also immediately credited to my account when they announced that they had finished fixing their bank software problems. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:25:11
Huh? .5% trading fee, under a day international wire transfer, 15 usd deposit fee for a 1k usd deposit on bitstamp. What exchange are you using? 
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:01:26
Arbitrage is a tricky thing. You have to account for the "time risk" of buying delay-&gt; BTC transferring delay -&gt;selling. Price could change during that time. 
Example: Buy at coinbase, delay a couple of hours/days, withdraw btc to transfer to korbit, delay again, and then sell again.

Same. Must've crashed the site.
@_date: 2013-11-10 23:27:54
Yeah thats the with the glasses icon. I do this all the time tonscan qr codes on my mobile
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:33:58
If I had the time, I would. :-)
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:47:05
I think there's a big difference between withdrawing a fraction of a coin and 10k usd...
@_date: 2013-11-11 00:43:08
Yes
