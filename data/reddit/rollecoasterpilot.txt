One year ago the price was about $5600, so yes it's possible.
@_date: 2018-10-21 12:15:42
Sounds like you have a gambling problem. Don't do it.
@_date: 2018-10-18 04:42:07
He's not going to like blockchain technology.
@_date: 2018-10-11 20:18:43
Bitcoin has dropped way more than the leading indexes.
@_date: 2018-10-14 03:13:55
It's the calm before the storm. I think we can expect somethign to happen by the end of the month.
@_date: 2018-10-17 05:14:46
Expect a pump around the weekend, and then another correction, unless it clearly breaks the 200 day MA, maybe.
@_date: 2018-10-21 16:10:49
Something's brewing. Buckle up.
@_date: 2018-10-16 19:03:21
You have to be this tall to ride.
@_date: 2018-10-16 09:08:31
Buckle up!
@_date: 2018-10-16 14:13:53
I'm glad I don't have enough money to be the subject of celebration on Reddit whenever I buy stuff. :P
@_date: 2018-10-12 01:36:40
Yes. It's me.
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:34:54
No. It's just the fact that they abuse the Bitcoin name and trick new people into thinking they're buying Bitcoin when they're ctually buying an altcoin.  
"First Generation Bitcoin"? Is that their new name for Bitcoin?  
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:11:10
What's for lunch?
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:40:12
As if you were going to cash out right now anyway.
@_date: 2018-11-03 16:20:19
The universe? really? 
@_date: 2018-11-05 19:50:49
That 200 day MA is just teasing.
@_date: 2018-11-28 00:53:28
Congratulations. One of the things you might have said happened because of happenstance. Now predict the next six months and see how it goes.
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:38:28
What a class act.
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:07:35
You changed my mind. Now that's what I would do.
@_date: 2018-11-07 20:31:19
Buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-20 00:23:28
Again. It gets repeated every swing cycle.
@_date: 2018-11-18 19:23:06
Buckle up!
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:01:03
Did you read the opening post?
@_date: 2018-11-22 18:45:31
I felt an itch.
@_date: 2018-11-14 03:17:50
lol $52.12B  
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:12:25
So if you sold your bitcoin, why do you care?
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:01:25
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:40:06
He may be weird and crazy by normie standards but he's not stupid.
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:36:32
LP 400 and LP 400S are rare and expensive. I guess the wide body yuppie Countaches are cheaper.
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:59:56
By shitcoin I mean Bcash.
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:01:36
I think it's overdue. The price now seems to just ride roughly $500 under the 200 day average.
@_date: 2018-11-17 22:12:13
How far from  Nürburgring  do you live?
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:00:16
Eth is good.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:24:31
Off course.
@_date: 2018-11-30 16:52:51
Weekend cooldown, maybe.
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:54:13
Duh. Because I want to see the price for one Bcash to be lower than one Eth. Why is that a problem?
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:45:46
And if we're extra lucky we get to reuse them twice.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:18:42
This isnt' preaching. This is when smart money buys. Dumb money buys when it's soaring.
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:45:29
Username checks out.
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:33:14
Buckle up. Keep your hands inside the ride at all times.
@_date: 2018-11-23 21:54:45
Miners shouldn't think about what the gain is right now. Mining 1 BTC today and paying $5000 to mine it (or whatever it costs) looks like a loss if one doesn't think about it, but it still means that 1 BTC will be worth $30k (or whatever) if the price of bitcoin goes up again, so in reality the miner then spent $5000 to mine 30k worth of BTC. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:31:37
I don't have disdain for people who got in high. Investing at 20k will probably give returns in the long run. Just reminding of the opportunity to improve the situation if they believe in the future of Bitcoin. I don't see why people who don't think Bitcoin has a future are even here.  
Smart people do dumb things all the time. Dumb people do smart things rarely.
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:48:10
It's a sign:  
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:12:15
I don't want him to eat his dick. Why would I? We lose if he does.
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:11:44
In times of despair, BUY!!11one
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:51:40
I just want to see shitcoin go below Ethereum in value.
@_date: 2018-11-11 03:50:28
Electrum is Segwit compatible.
@_date: 2018-11-13 20:04:00
I can't blame'em. Right now it's like buying money with money for no apparent reason for most people.
@_date: 2018-11-11 23:19:35
That's good news, because if mass adoption already happened then Bitcoin is fucked.
@_date: 2018-11-18 20:49:07
You have to be this tall to ride. The teacups are over there.
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:45:58
Desperation pump.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:41:37
Look on the bright side. We get to reuse all the old memes.
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:13:01
Maybe they are salty gamers that blame miners for not being able to buy GPUs, even though miners buy their GPUs from the same place gamers do.
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:21:05
You're kind of describing a store. You would basically become a vendor that sells stuff for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:17:27
So you predicted they would happen a year later? Did you also predict the bullrun that happened after you made that prediction?  
Every time there's a large dip all the trolls feel like geinuses.
@_date: 2018-11-07 22:57:10
NOK and SEK is where it's at. They are backed by happiness.
@_date: 2018-11-27 21:20:13
He doesn't have to be a good president or win the hearts of the people to succeed personally. Success in life seems to happen more often to those who take advantage of other people.
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:08:16
I thought Black Friday was yesterday.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:06:49
If you're one of the people who FOMOed in last december and you're down 50-60% on your investment, now is your golden chance to change that by taking advantage of the sale. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:59:52
I'd get a Lambo Countach LP400 if I had $100 million.
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:59:52
Huh? Market cap is already well below Eth. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 18:41:30
Even if you had only bought buy at each ATH before a crash... probably.
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:08:52
It's obviously a view of the earthdisc from above.
@_date: 2018-11-16 11:25:43
Bcashers are worried that Binance is "unfairly damaging their brand".[
The irony.
@_date: 2018-11-21 18:08:26
Unless you invested more than you could afford you do NOT want to sell whe it's in a dip. It will swing. Investing is a long term game.  
If you can afford to play the game this is when you buy more. If you end up worrying about it because you need the money for life things now then you probably shouldn't have invested.
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:00:57
That's not how currencies work.
@_date: 2018-11-14 03:13:01
WTF just happened?  
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:48:02
It could be useful. Sometimes I find things I need on Ebay from sellers that refuse to ship internationally for example. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 17:56:12
What is your plot?
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:55:57
If I were you I'd leave a small amount as Bitcoin to catch the next bullrun. Just in case.
@_date: 2018-11-03 20:45:29
He jinxed it.
@_date: 2018-11-29 21:08:28
What is your plot?
@_date: 2018-11-16 04:29:57
Blockchain.info right now:  BCH - $147.39  
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:08:27
This is true. Bulls are buyers. The people jsut waiting for the price to go up are not bulls.
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:33:12
"those who provide value, a great product or honest service" 
"the leeches, scum, thieves, and gamblers of the world"
Not nice.
Try harder.
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:08:08
Not sure if I agree. Trump became president. Nice guys finish last.
@_date: 2018-11-30 18:22:51
Probably Nicehash Miner.
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:54:34
Calf run.
@_date: 2018-11-29 18:20:03
Note that you don't have to buy a full bitcoin. You can buy any fraction you are comfortable with.
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:11:27
I didn't confuse the two of you. lol Why did you think that?
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:00:34
Must be made of goldfish.
@_date: 2018-12-01 20:14:16
@_date: 2018-12-03 13:43:59
Does not compute.
@_date: 2018-12-01 22:45:21
Bears scare the shit out of me.
@_date: 2018-12-04 10:07:57
Is valve the new hodl?
@_date: 2018-12-01 02:43:39
You're always saying sell, so not surprised you said sell then too.
