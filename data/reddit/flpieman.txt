Do you know anyone who can do it right now? Or is the technology too new and it has to be done "manually"?

Are lightning transactions going to be supported by coinbase? I'd love if there were a way to shorten the fees and transaction times that I associate with coinbase.

Oh ok, well everything I have in bitcoin I can afford to lose so I'm not really planning around drastic changes like coinbase being shut down. But thanks for the explanation.

What's wrong with keeping your coins in an online exchange? I didn't know there was a penalty other than transaction fees.

Your bitcoin exchange/wallet should tell you. Look for something like "recieve money"

Thanks for the tip! Can I buy Bitcoin through Gdax?

So I'll admit I didn't read the whole article, but early on you say Bitcoin charges less transaction fees than Banks, but my experience with bitcoin has been the opposite. Often the fees are over 5% which is far far more than what a bank charges me.

Maybe I'm missing something but even on large, $400+ transactions I was paying $30+ in fees. I'm doing this through coinbase. This is for transfers, not purchases or sales.
This is currently the biggest deterrent from using Bitcoin for me, it seems deceptive to claim the exact opposite. Maybe it's possible to have lower fees if you avoid using an exchange, but average users aren't going to figure that out. It's like circumventing Bank fees by not using a bank.
