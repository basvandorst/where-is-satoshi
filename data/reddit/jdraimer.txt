I got some too. I'm just wondering if they are reusable? If you wipe them clean, then you should be able to load them up again correct?

As an editor, it is usually the Producer who calls the shots all the way through. If not, it's the Execs or Network. In the news, the reporter writes up the story, interviews the subject, then takes what they got and give the Editor a script on how they want it cut. Overall, the interviewee rarely likes the final cut of their interview that goes to air.

I would love to see a Yelp! for Bitcoin. I want to know on a map what businesses around me accept Bitcoin. I'm sure there are not too many at the moment but the times are a changing!

Their browser web wallet is the same thing.

I work in TV and used to work for the news. They will rework your interview to say whatever they want. Fun video, but these guys are right. They're looking at the fact that it makes fun of people who use it. If anything, you should showcase the animation you did for Tapeke.

I found the hard drive and unfortunately, it had been reformatted long ago. I should have taken Bitcoin more seriously back then!

Thank you. I will look for the hard drive and file when I get home.
