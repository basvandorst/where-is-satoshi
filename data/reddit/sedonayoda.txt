Yes but I assume the exchange being used would already load your coins into lighting since that would be the network to use for retail transactions.

I think we tried the organic grassroots method and it failed. Nobody listened, nobody cared. The general public didnt care until corporations and wall street endorsed it and pushed the price past 10k.
Honestly I knew this would happen. I saw the "people rising up" and taking bankers by surprise as a fairytale. I always knew bitcoin adoption would come top down, except of course for early visionaries that saw bitcoin's potential in the beginning.
So to me, everything is going to plan. Bitcoin will disrupt everything is supposed to. You just had too high of expectations of the general populace. Bankers, corporate execs, millionaires are generally pretty smart people and have an interest in how money works. They were always going to be the next wave.
Commerce will begin, and already has, once luxury companies start trying to gain an edge by catering to the new bitcoin rich. It will continue down the chain from there.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:53:56
So lets assume the user bought their coins on Coinbase and that for now they are sitting in their Coinbase wallet. Now if they were to buy something from an online retailer I am assuming that Coinbase would send that payment through a lighting channel and then that would be that, so no problems there.
Now what if this new user decides we wants to store his coins in a Ledger or paperwallet. He would be able to withdraw from coinbase and put them on a paper or hardware wallet all while staying within the lighting network?
When would mainnet settlement be needed for an average retail user or saver?

2. You are storing your bitcoin in a *bank*?
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:05:08
Thanks for the explanations by the way.
What would be the difference between CB opening a channel to the new wallet and sending a payment to the retailer? Couldn't the coins be routed to the new wallet the same way, channel hops everywhere?
I guess my main question is this - are there downsides to buying coins already locked in lightning channels? Can you store purchased "lighting coins" and how solid are these coins vs IOUs?
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:24:04

No I won't, because nobody cares. Some backwater, unregulated exchange for internet tokens nobody knew about. Of course nobody cared. And by nobody, I mean the finance world. As bitcoin goes mainstream in the finance world, that will change. They will expect higher standards of service.
By the way, are you willing to admit now that GBTC and other centralized services have value to certain people who aren't you? That in their case - it makes sense?
I have given plenty of reasons, to which you have offered no coherent resistance. I'm just wondering if you are ready to admit defeat and fall on your sword in shame?

@_date: 2015-12-09 22:39:54
Just 2 things to add -
1. Nobody is doing proof of reserves *yet*. Because nobody really cares yet. Expect this to change as bitcoin hits the bigtime.
2. Most individuals don't trust *themselves* to secure their bitcoin, and rightly so. I think this is the biggest risk for most people. It's easy if you hand them a paper wallet and tell them to put it in a safe and open when rich - yes. But this quickly falls apart if the investor wants to USE their bitcoin like real savings. An average consumer is likely to fuck up the spending process and delete their original key, send to the wrong address, etc etc. And to touch a little of bit of the money, access is exposed to *all* of it. Enter centralized services that will help these investors not accidently delete all their money.

Uh no, that's a bad analogy.
@_date: 2015-12-17 09:21:14


It's hard to disagree with this, since I can't give any concrete evidence, but I do. Their main motivation might indeed be to speed up their systems, but like you kind of said, it really all ties into the future that is coming.
I do see the word "bitcoin" here not neccessarily as bitcoin itself, but any future system that shares bitcoin's open properties. They have to know change is coming, that the change was first brought on by the bitcoin blockchain, and that the future is going to be faster and on *some* kind of blockchain. So their systems are going to need to updated to interface with this, in whatever final form it takes *outside of their internal systems*.
Am I making any sense? I think they are planning around an open blockchain currency possibly taking over, whether each individual realizes they are working towards that goal or not. It will be their end result anyway. 
I do not expect them to be building systems that explicitly will accept bitcoins at this stage. The point is, once their systems are blockchainalized, interface to a bitcoin blockchain would be trivial if it looks like it will actually take over, making them prepared for the future. No need to mention bitcoin at all, and that's why they don't.
Again, this is hard to argue because I have to do it without evidence.

Everything is wrong with this? No. It simply fills the needs of different types of investors. What is wrong with trusting somebody else to handle your security instead of yourself? Bitcoin does not remove the need for trust, even if you are holding your own private key, you have to trust yourself to secure it.
Just like there are million ways for a company to lose coins, same goes for an individual. If your wallet got hacked, or your paper wallet got burned in a fire, your GBTC shares would be just fine.
It is not all or nothing either. It can be wise not to put all your eggs in one basket. Have some at home, and some in stock in a regulated company.
Given how easy it is to audit bitcoin reserves, I'm not too worried about paper gold. A low, calculated risk.
GBTC is a foot in the door to traditional markets. Even if bitcoin disrupts the whole thing, and it all goes away, these steps are needed *first*.
Banks are always going to be around. Because people get nervous holding onto all their money.
 If someone breaks into your house, it is very helpful to truthfully tell them the rest of your money is in a bank account *that you cannot access right now*. What is the robber to do, upgrade this to a hostage situation? Not likely.
Don't go overboard with the childish banks-are-satan rhetoric. Banks exists because they provide a valuable service, but in recent times they have outgrown the original idea and have been creating money. Bitcoin will solve *that* part.

FOMO is important here. Financial entities have to realize that if bitcoin starts to gain ground, pursuing their own blockchain becomes a risky proposition. Too much time and resources spent here could leave them behind in the race.
21's goal of creating this huge mining network is important to solidifying bitcoin's place. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 19:10:23
Exactly. Institutions like NASDAQ would never, ever trust their database systems to random international entities.
Before blockchain technology can really take of in the US we will need an institutional level American mining operation that can ensure investors that no matter what happens in the outside world, the blockchain will still be up and running here.

Your missing my point.  It doesn't matter who got the mining lottery, it matters that network be ensured to exist and secure up to their standards.
The amount of hashing power they use matters but not too much.
For instance what if NASDAQ started using the blockchain. Most of the hashing power resided in China and Europe. Then a critical change was made to bitcoin, or suddenly all the miners on the outside die of mysterious diseases, the scenario doesn't matter - what are they going to tell their investors? They have to have a *reliable* blockchain. And reliability up to the high standards of their investors to keep that ledger running they they are holding their settlement system accountable to. Currently mining companies are about as shady and nonofficial as the old exchanges. That will have to change to make big money happy. 21 inc is the first step in that process.
Believe me, American companies only truly trust other American companies.

But this is more aimed at crossing borders and remittances I think. Coinbase or Circle is no help there(yet).
@_date: 2015-05-02 19:45:29
Agreed. Both sides affect each other.
As bitcoin is used as the rails of transferring fiat money, it becomes more useful. As its utility increases it will require more bitcoin to support more fiat money movement, it becomes more valuable. This translates into a better store of value for anyone who saw this coming.
As the prices rises, it attracts more investment capital into the currency, which indirectly increases the value of the companies using its transmission system. More valuable companies means more powerful companies. These companies are then able to expand and use bitcoin as their transmission system in a wider array of markets and use cases. The utility of bitcoin increases.
Which increases its store of value.
And on it goes.

So isn't the problem that we don't have our own chip manufacturers? Or in other words, could this be bitcoin exposing, yet again, an economic problem that already existed and providing incentive to fix it?

Edit : The problem isn't that bitcoin mining is centralized in China. The real problem, is that world production is centralized in China. And because of bitcoin, we can watch direct symptoms of this in our little ecosystem.

LN depends on SegWit and bigger blocks. But from what I'm gathering nobody believes the solution to scaling bitcoin to a mainstream level is to keep increasing blocksizes until it can accomodate the worlds population. The only actual solution I've heard for endgame scaling is LN. 
Or do people believe Segwit and consistent blocksize jumping would be enough?

This is what I was looking for, thank you. Which option do you think would most likely to be used if Lightning was not workable?

@_date: 2017-03-15 18:02:53
I agree with most of that post. Bitcoin has shown resilience to outside events and some internal ones like the Ghash debacle. But I think the biggest danger is competition from within the cryptocurrency space. All of those geopolitical events could cause a flow into bitcoin, but it will clearly need to be the best crypto investment. There needs to be no question.
Clearly now there *is* question. Interest in crypto and blockchains are at an all time high. Yet we are not seeing that interest reflected in the bitcoin ecosystem like we were a few years ago when interest was high. Few years ago it was - "we can timestamp health records on the blockchain! we can bank africa! we can have sidechains that put any alt features on the blockchain! IOT micropayments!"
Now all that has fallen to the wayside. It seems our last hope was becoming a serious financial product traded on mainstream markets. Digital gold. Is there anything else going on, anything else we are still shooting for?
@_date: 2016-03-16 20:31:40

Notorization of of ticket, insurance, legal documents on the bitcoin blockchain. Proof of validity of these documents could lower legal costs, maybe even in court settings. Steamlines verification of document claims. If the doc was hashed on the *public* blockchain, it is undisputed proof that this document was made and unchanged at this certain time. You would not have to convince a legal authority that you had not altered your own records, which I imagine would at least streamline some process.

No worries at all. People aren't spending because they don't think the current price is fair. They think it will be me much higher in the future. If enough people buy and HODL, it will. But we are all human. Once the price starts getting higher eventually the temptation to spend it on toys or needs will be too great. And the largest hodlers will start selling some first. Merchants will start to cater to these high net worth individuals by offering luxury goods and services for bitcoin to directly. And on down the the list of hodlers it will go, top to bottom. Until the price is high enough to convince the smaller hodlers to indulge in some of the good life. Bitcoin commerce has been bootstrapped.
@_date: 2016-06-09 04:01:16

Well the whole exciting thing about this is it's all new. Nobody has any real idea what's going to happen. Theories are the name of the game and if you wait for proof or hard evidence you will always be a step behind.
As for big blocks that seems pretty insignificant in the whole argument on whether bitcoin can sustain an economy or not. I'm not going to get in any of that mess because I really don't care.
Goodnight. Good talk.
@_date: 2016-06-09 04:53:33
1. But hodlers don't think bitcoin can go up infinitely. Everyone has their price. Do you really think anyone is holding out for 800 million per coin? No, right? 
People with larger stashes tend to have a lower spend price. People with one coin might be hoping to become a millionaire one day. They might hold that coin until a million per, because they see it as the limit of bitcoin's potential. And they will be less wanting to spend it because they know they don't have a large cut of the pie compared to others. Everyone has a price, and it is a different number for everyone based on a whole bunch of incalculable factors. The point is, it's not 800 million. So, the real unknown number is between 0 and 800 million. When the bitcoin price passes their belief, they will spend to lock the value into assets. It will be an emotionally intense time. Greed, ecstasy, fear, and doubt will easily skew an otherwise rational person's thinking when they dealing with larger sums of money than they have ever seen.
2. Why bother arguing with what they think? Either say you're argument in your own words or don't. We are all talking theories here, including them. It's not like citing sources.

2. You did not present reason. You said that academics present reason that you believe. Not saying they're wrong, I don't know what they said. You do. But you said nothing. You gave me nothing to accept.
3. I said the hodlers will eventually *not* hodl. The error you are making is that you believe hodlers think bitcoin will be guaranteed to go up. There are no guarantees in rising price that would enact that rule you're talking about. During huge price rises they will try to hold on on their belief in the fundamentals or hype that the price will go even higher, so hodl longer. But there will always be doubt, because the whole thing could fall apart from some yet undiscovered cause. Once they see huge value contained such a novel, untested and maybe, possibly fragile asset - they will eventually succumb to diversification to further secure that value. Whether that be in dollars, real estate, or ferraris. The percentage of their coins needed to purchase their dreams will dwindle and dwindle as the price rises, and in the end they will give in. Because we all have dreams. The merchants recieiving the coins may hodl them or trade them based on their personal beliefs of bitcoins success. And others will buy and them and save, and so on.

Dude there's nothing wrong with GBTC besides it being the only access you have via IRA funds. This is why there is a premium. If you want to wait for an ETF, and think the price after that's announced will be a better deal than the current GBTC premium... well that gamble is on you.

Generally, the argument is made that humans having their hands on a money faucet leads to corruption - always. To print money is basically unlimited power.
So a more stable monetary system in one where no one controls the faucet. The classic example being gold, since no one can create more. Bitcoin has an even harder limit than gold since it is a mathematically defined limit, and nobody actually knows how much gold there is in the ground.

A series of bubbles over the years, which it now appears we have finished the downside of the a big bubble, so many people think are starting to begin a new one soon, but who knows.
Right now the bitcoin ecosystem is in the building/capital investment phase. Investors are making bets that bitcoin technology is the way of the future and so are handing large sums of cash to builders to help companies. 
Mass consumer products and companies are in the works. Until those are ready, you can invest and learn.

Agreed.. people get caught in this stupid shit of "hoarding and never spending" argument. Stupid. Assuming the value of their money goes up, how long do you think the average person can hold out? Eventually they're going to want to BUY something they've always wanted. And those less wealthy will be spending on necessities anyway. Bitcoin's system discourages frivolous spending, not spending itself.

I don't think sending coins like this will be at all feasible by any kind of majority. I'm not sure I understand the optimism in this situation.

Nothing. You are interacting with the legacy financial system at that point, which is trust based. You are trusting them to complete your transaction. Who you decide to trust from then on, whether it's Gemini or a guy on Craigslist who's going to meet up and hand you cash for them, is entirely up to you not Bitcoin

No. Because those protoccols had no connection with any of it. Both of the scenarios require the concept of money. Which FTP and HTTP dont have.
Bitcoin natively introduces a collectible token which is used to control and manage resources on its network. As far as the bitcoin universe functions, this is money. Which means for this protocol game theory matters

Entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss chose State Street Corp. to help them launch a new exchange-traded fund based on the virtual currency bitcoin, according to a regulatory filing Tuesday.
The twin brothers are hoping the Securities and Exchange Commission approves their new fund, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, after a process that has already gone on for more than three years. In its latest filing, a seventh amendment to its original filing, the brothers said State Street, based in Boston, would serve as transfer agent, while San Francisco-based Burr Pilger Mayer will act as auditor.
The transfer agent acts as a fund’s administrator, responsible for recording ownership changes, calculating the daily net asset value, and maintaining records.
Burr Pilger Mayer, meanwhile, will conduct monthly “proof of control” exercises, essentially an audit to show that all the bitcoin reported as being held by the fund are legitimate. The exercise will be carried out by Gemini, the Winklevoss’s exchange and trust company that will act as the ETF’s custodian, and results will be verified by Burr Pilger Mayer.

    With a Bitcoin ETF, Risk Isn’t Virtual (Sept. 7, 2014)
Bitcoin is a digital currency that isn’t backed by any government or private entity. It was launched in 2009 by an anonymous person calling himself Satoshi Nakamoto.
The price of bitcoin in its earlier days was wildly erratic, and indeed is still volatile. However, since a spike in late 2013 and crash in early 2014, it has been more stable. This year, it has generally been rising, and is up about 48%, trading recently at $635.
An SEC-approved ETF could attract more mainstream investors to the asset, but that isn’t a sure thing and it is unclear how the SEC will rule. There has been a fairly competitive race to get a bitcoin ETF out to the investing public, and it is seen as a key conduit for the digital currency to gain exposure to more mainstream investors.
There is already a bitcoin ETF on the market, the Bitcoin Investment Trust from Barry Silbert’s Grayscale Investments. It trades over the counter and hasn't been approved by the SEC. In addition, another offering from a firm called SolidX is awaiting SEC approval.

You didn't say anything..?
The article failed to make a point(other than some guy made her feel uncomfortable), I don't know what points you are making about reddit.
If I am interested in a subject. I pursue that subject. If I meet unfriendly people along the way, I route around them, in pursuit of my subject. Especially when you're not talking about working inside a company, just random people. I am an adult, I long ago realized it would be unrealistic to make my way through the world expecting people to be nice to me. 
If women, or anyone, wants to learn about bitcoin, they will. I fail to see how we could stop them even if we wanted to.
What does this have to do with white males?
@_date: 2015-10-01 16:57:31
You are describing problems with men in general. None of this has anything to do with bitcoin, or is exclusive to bitcoin.
Everything you have shown here is pretty much on par with normal human male behaviour. Anytime there is a large group of men you will get some bad apples like these. So if you want to complain and rail against it, fine, but know that you are angry with negative human traits in general and it makes no sense to target bitcoin specifically, and expect bitcoin to magically be different for some reason.
Linking random anonymous user comments is retarded. You could make the same case for reddit as a whole being bad and should be stopped. 
Upvoting a stripper with groups logo tatted on her? Show me a group of guy hobbyists who wouldn't. It's not that serious, especially since it's occuring on a free for all internet forum like reddit. Why would you expect anything different? This is not the corporate boardroom.
Bitcoin is free and open. Anyone may start their own communities around bitcoin to suit their specific tastes, whether for more professional discussion or political centered views, and no one is going to mind at all. Reddit may not be the best platform depending on what the person is looking for. Someone really hates it? Join the mailing list. Start a tumblr.

You ever moved dollars around? It's not instant either
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:51:28
Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with your reading comprehension?
You don't wait at the register for btc confirmations, it's accepted instantly with 0 confirmations. This is the equivalent of using a credit card - the card is accepted with "0 confirmations" and the merchant gets his money a few weeks later when it's "confirmed".
When you wire money (move dollars) it is usually confirmed with a couple of  business days. When you move Bitcoin it is usually confirmed (6 confirmations) within a couple of hours.
This  is the third time I've said all this.

Nope. That's why I said we are overestimating retail when this shit goes viral. They just looked at a 2.6k coin and went " well I can't afford THAT" and bought eth instead. Call them stupid all you want, but what did you guys think mainstream adoption would look like?? We do NOT want to miss out on this wave of newcomers.

Yeah its really up to the exchanges to coordinate and make this happen if we wanted any kind of lasting implementation.

RSK is on testnet right now. LN requires segwit, I believe the alpha for segwit2x is out june 16th

I was under the impression that most users were fine with this compromise.
As for time,  I think we are running out of it. We have competition. It won't be very long before nobody is going to care if we fixed it. I can't speak to the safety of the larger blocks.

Loving mine so far. And when I show it to my friends suddenly they take bitcoin seriously, which is ironic.

If holders get richer, merchants will cater to that growing sector because they will want the business. I suspect luxury goods sellers will be among the first to accommodate.

Without an ICO?
