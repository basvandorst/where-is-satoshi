Okay, I'm used to the occasional craziness showing up on this sub, but this is seriously a new absolute low. You're worse than the guy who stole the pumpkins in front of his kids.

The part where you asked the guy to jump through hoops for 'charity' to promote your pet cause.

it's not so much being disgusted by ancaps, it's being entertained that they think their philosophy is valid.
oh, also the mt. gox butthurt seems to come from here, if you haven't noticed.

do you honestly believe people get paid to give bitcoin bad press? that happens on its own.

You're talking about screwing over an entire generation of people when they're old and vulnerable. You can argue individual wording all you want, but that's pretty fucked up.

how's the view up there on your cross?

People could also read what they sign and not bitch about it afterward.

After dealing with the public for a shift the last thing I want to do is figure out how the hell to go through all the steps necessary to download a wallet (I have one, but most people would be starting from zero), get the tip, then get it transferred to USD so it would actually be useful.

Careful, you'll upset their shill account that was spam replying to every comment about Cryptsy a couple days ago.

I'm talking about what I see here all the time, people claiming that someone who doesn't agree with them is paid to sit on reddit and watch shitposts in the new section of beans.
I don't believe the people who claim they've been 'approached' for a second.
@_date: 2014-11-30 04:43:50
Posts like this are why we can't have nice things.

it's actually a mixture, it's a truncated quote from that got more downvotes than anything I've ever seen.
@_date: 2014-09-01 08:08:17
holy shit, you're actually serious, aren't you?

North Korea has some of the largest deposits of rare earth materials in the world. That's why Russia and China are so keen to do business with them.

implying zerohedge is a good source for economic opinion
@_date: 2015-03-10 22:18:22
You put those in quotes like they don't actually happen, when they do.

until the price drops 10% in an hour or two.

"Guys, for fuck's sake, I said *don't* kill each other, did you even read my memo?"
@_date: 2015-02-11 01:43:35
That makes me really hope it happens. Maybe it'll scare off some of the shitposters on this sub.

That's pretty intensely cringy.

If the blockchain can't keep up with transactions as it is, how is the problem needing to put even more shit on it?
@_date: 2015-02-10 15:53:22
It's not a competitive system right now.
@_date: 2015-02-13 03:45:30
At least people who play around with Dogecoin for the most part realize that it has flaws and isn't going to replace any current financial system.

Oh dear. Let's hope some people used PGP and cleaned up after themselves, there's about to be some fireworks.

There are valid criticisms for bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. If you can't handle that, then you're part of the cult-like atmosphere that turns a lot of people off to it all. What you're asking for is censorship, however you want to try to polish that turd of yours.

nothing says 'i'm the manliest man in this room' like talking about your cold storage wallet and how taxes are theft.
@_date: 2015-02-13 04:25:53
Probably because there's a pretty decent subsection of the community here who won't shut up about it being all about investing.
