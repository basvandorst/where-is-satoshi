This. Most people just want to convince others to buy so the value will go up. It's like stocktwits. Everyone's bullish when they want the price to go up, not when they actually think it's going up
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:47:49
Sorry for your loss man. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:50:26
Look at my comment. I said do GBTC. It got downvoted. Now look at their price from when I said it
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:51:52
Would've definitely paid off lmfao
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:29:35
Because they can?
@_date: 2017-08-20 01:00:43
A second fork though?
@_date: 2017-08-20 01:06:16
Will do. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:42:20
Congrats man! Glad you paid off your debts! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:41:52
Yes 
@_date: 2017-09-26 08:44:01
I appreciate the information !
@_date: 2017-09-30 03:12:09
Do GBTC
@_date: 2017-09-21 22:08:51
Put to use? Depends what you mean. But a famous person can, and has, benefited from speculation.
@_date: 2017-09-08 00:00:19
How much money you got OP? If you have a couple thousand I'd put it into GBTC for a bit. I've made a lot doing this. When to get in is up to you. 
Both are investments but there are tax benefits to GBTC, well more of an ease if anything. 
Own both imo. I do 
@_date: 2017-09-04 03:01:55
Good shit! I would've got LTC for $50 but atleast you're investing man. When I was 16 I heard about it but didn't know &lt;18 could. Missed out lol

Good job kid

I listened to a few of your shows and it's very basic. But atleast y'all admitted that you're still learning and developing. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 06:33:36
Damn right

I've lost money on ZRX so I feel this guys pain.
Not to this amount but still
@_date: 2017-09-11 21:50:33
I'm not dogging it. I grew up in Fayetteville NC and it may be hit by the hurricane so I've actually thought of using my own wallet for charity (transfer or sell what I have and use it as a blank wallet or even create a new one) so I can also help out my home town community.  I wish charities did use cryptos but Red Cross is still shitty regardless. Me being a former (I moved a few months back) member I can still impact the community if I did receive enough donations. It's a thought I had man.
Either way I respect the fact you did post this. My views on the Red Cross is not conflicted with my views about people willing to donate. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 06:36:33
Wait addresses change all the time? Me and my friends have eachothers wallet addresses saved incase one of us need financial help. Does this mean it has changed? Obviously we will ask prior to sending what's the current addy but still. Like will it change if I send it then another person sends? Sorry if this is a stupid question 
@_date: 2017-09-09 23:25:29
So you're looking more long term.'I say crypto over GBTC. Crypto will still be here SEC still hasn't even approved of GBTC 
@_date: 2017-09-21 22:13:20
OP stocks are psychological mostly. BTC has massive volatility so if t goes down you can expect more panic reactions. Today I would see the chart go down a bit and be like "watch it's gonna drop." Next thing I knew that candlestick flew straight down. Or it would go close to like $3700 I knew sellers were gonna sell after. It's al psychological. Remember a stock, or crypto is only worth what people are willing to pay for it. Factor in that with your chart readings.
@_date: 2017-09-21 22:10:57
I wish when I was in the military I did. I had less to worry about (as far as bills). Plus I probably would've just used the per diem during deployments or training as a means to purchase.
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:49:26
Good job.
To get more bang for my buck I would've went with ETH or LTC. Either way good shit man
@_date: 2017-09-11 21:47:11
Red Cross is horrible man. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 21:46:53
They'd use decentralized exchanges like oX correct? I'm sorry if I'm wrong and OP I'm not trying to mislead you I'm just very curious about this as well and this is the only way I can see it happening, as far as I have researched. Which isn't far :) 
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:03:17

There are people who do this. I imagine they just get the amount of BTCs worth at payday during that time. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 06:32:14
This made me laugh lmfao
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:56:30
I have Gemini for BTC. Right now my actual problem is finding a reliable/ secure place to buy LTC. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:52:53
No, YOU lose when THEY sell. If I have 20k worth and I sell it I still get 20k. If a majority sells and it goes down but you HODL then YOU lose. However if everyone HODL it'll go up and you'll make more.
Everyone has the right to their decision. Don't say they'll lose or win because at the end of the day it affects them. 
Although HODL would be the best option in my OPINION. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:10:58
Lmfao I love this 
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:44:51
Congrats on pointing out the obvious 
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:12:18
Oooooh my god the same questions keep popping up all the time just fucking read 
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:29:09
Wait, coinbase has a limit?
I'm sorry I'm new to this. What do you guys use and why?
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:44:33
I don't use kraken ����‍♀️
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:26:40
Wait breadwallet you can sell straight from breadwallet? Does it have to be just local? Is loafwallet the same?
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:45:11
Hey OP calm down. Taking a loan and then expecting to get rich is really risky.
But I'm not here to bash you for it just remember there are plenty of people who have done what you did for stocks, some even sold their house, and regret it. $35 stackaroos is still $35 stackaroos. You also have to take into account you can lose your job. Shit happens. 
What I think you should do is spend however much you can a month. You have $4500. I say if you're single amd since you're 22 you should have atleast $2000 left over every month right? I'm 22 and I don't get paid shit but when I was 19 I got about $2500 a month. I put $1000 into a savings every month and now all my savings are dispersed in different stocks. If you're stuck on just investing in BTC then go for it. But I think it'd be less risky to just invest every month any extras you have. If you were willing to pay 800 a month for that loan then throw in 800 into BTC. You might beat yourself up laternfor it if all BTC does is sky rocket and you could've got more money but people literally commit suicide doing what you just said, if they lose. 
Just my 0.02 Cents. I do hope whatever you do it works out for you man. Hopefully I see a post by you in the future with you in a yacht with hella hunnies 
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:57:12
Bro take it easy. You realize there's a fuckton of people who recently submitted their shit. You can't get mad at mcdonalds for not getting your order in on a regular average time if they have hundreds before you.

I just expected a little bit of resistance. But thanks for the clarification 
@_date: 2017-07-03 04:15:13
So many issues with coinbase 
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:28:19
I partially agree only because I have not recently seen a change in business accepting ETH the way they are with BTC and even LTC.
Would anyone assume LTC will follow as well? 
@_date: 2017-07-01 00:35:15
Unless there's a system emplaced where a transaction can immediately be sold and the store gets whatever their fiat is. I think that's doable. Especially if big companies do this. You don't want millions of dollars worth of Crypto currencies in the hands of just big companies and they don't want it either
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:48:18
You seem to be decent with money. How about you just put the 15000 in? 
@_date: 2017-07-05 22:19:05
Just out of curiosity whys that? Fees? 
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:40:36
Are there limits in wallets like breadwallet?
@_date: 2017-07-04 17:05:14
Can't do anything about it. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 20:23:08
I'm surprised a lot of people are okay with BTC being taxed in the first place. The whole point is to be decentralized. Although I do see how people trading it (like investing in stocks/ shares) help with liquidity. Who knows man.
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:57:35
Hey bro she was manipulative. My ex was too. She's on campus with me and I literally have to keep changing parking lots to avoid her and her friends. Yet she's telling everyone I'm stalking her and she wants a "restraining order." She also manipulated in other ways but to keep this short I'm glad you didn't bro. 
Good job on keeping your investment. Good job on breaking free, I know how hard that is especially when you said how infatuated you were with her. So good job broski. Also cyber security is something I'm interested in. CISO is my main goal!
Also good shit on working out and improving all aspects! Good stories like this makes my day! 
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:41:58
I'm glad this worked out for you. As long as you pay back the BTC you owe of course. 
You're not destroying the environment and you're helping the liquidity. Props amigo.
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:09:51
Appreciate the input man'!
@_date: 2017-07-05 22:21:31
Nvm I reread. I get it now.

RemindMe! 1 month 
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:59:41
Exchanging BTC to LTC for example would be anonymous through ShapeShift? Also could it be used to... let's say avoid taxes? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:45:37
Wasn't there a guy who lost his BTC because he kept it on a boat and the boat flooded or some shit?

You can have a fucking bot do this shit for you? 
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:17:52
No one can promise that. Also that has nothing to do with my question. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:48:48
This is the funniest shit I've read in a while
@_date: 2017-06-30 22:42:54
For the same amount of hassle I'd go with gemini. Shit even breadwallet lets you buy and it provides good security. Breadwallet is for iOS users. 
I wouldn't touch coinbase personally. Too many people have had large amounts of transactions "taken," and I couldn't risk it. Gemini is one of my favorites.
Disclaimer: it's just what I choose to do. More people can probably provide a better answer. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 02:49:08

It's just irrelevant to my question so this convo is pointless to me and I didn't want to answer
@_date: 2017-06-04 01:26:28
Oh. I think you misunderstood the question. There's companies like the one I mentioned that are related to BTC. I was wondering if anyone else are into it and what they invest in/ why.
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:38:53

What if it was to purchase a product via internet that isn't legal? I've always wondered this. Shouldn't really be any different than people paying a western union transfer with their name and card info to buy such things right?
