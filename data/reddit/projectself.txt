I do not understand how the fork between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash affects the original limit of 21 million coins that was built into the design.  
If they shared the base up until August 2017, do they now each get half of what is left?  Did it double to 42 million coins, what happens if one or both of those teams fork again?  How does this affect the hard limit on the number of coins?

Thank you, that makes sense. 
Does each fork honor the coins that were created before the fork?  If so, would the coins mined say in block 0 and block 1 be bitcoin and bitcoin cash coins?  That's the piece I am not following.  If they fork the ledger, they still have to have a ledger going back to the beginning right?

if you bought at 3, sold at 10k.  you owe taxes on all that.  
if you then re-bought at 19k, and rode it down to 3k.  you get a little break from those losses.  nowhere near the amount of taxes you owe on first cash out.  
you may have ended up with 100 dollars net profit, but that doesnt change the fact that you may have made huge gains on the days you sold.  that's what they want.
bitcoin is not exactly a commodity, it is not a stock.  it is considered property.  every sale is a distinct event.

This has been trotted out so many times, if, and I mean big *if* it does print a 16k this month, I think 29k Feb almost becomes self fulfilling just on fomo momentum.

Unless you own the stock certificates, you don't own the stock.  You have an account with the stock brokerage

I am assuming he would want to use his paycheck for rent and food, thus requiring he convert it to us dollars.  Thus end up being effectively double taxed.

An atomic operation means that it occurs in one action or not at all.  ie, if the desire is to increment one and decrement another - either both are performed or none are performed.  The term really heralds back to more core computer science - particularly related to multi threaded apps - where you may have different things occurring simultaneously and if they get out of sequence they can be manipulated with a race condition.  
As it applies to crypto, it means each side of the transaction enters into a timelocked contract - and both sides either complete it, or do not.  It is an atomic operation, all or none.

sure it does.  us dollars is a currency.  
bitcoin is a commodity.  
selling a commodity has a capital gains tax of 40-60%
each sell is a taxable event.

The contractual language on my mortgage requires it be paid in fiat currency, my daughters college requires being paid in us dollars.  I see no problem exchanging one form of value for another provided at the time of transaction I get the value I am seeking.
*edit - the point being, I agree on not exchanging to fiat to hold fiat, but I do see the point of exchanging for fiat to then immediately trade that fiat for something of perceived value.  an asset, a liability removed.

Not rose 2250 premium, their currency fell in value so it takes more to get the same.
It like saying bread rose in price.. well not really.  their currency fell in value
