Sorry, I realized now you asked if it's safer. 
If someone finds a BIP38 private key then they still need the password to spend the funds. So BIP38 offers some physical protection. 
If someone finds a wallet seed they can restore the whole wallet. So there is no protection against physical threats with HD backups. 
Trezor lets you protect against this by letting you add a custom 25th word to to the already 24 word seed. That way if someone finds the seed they still need an additional passphrase to make the complete seed. Note how I say passphrase because if you lose or forget the passphrase you're out of luck. 
Hope that helps.

Hey! I run BitcoinClock.com
The other sites are assuming 10 minute blocks. I use data from bitcoinity to make the estimate using the average block time over the last 6 months which is about 9.37 minutes between blocks. This leads to a much more accurate prediction. I update that each month with data from the last month.

Thanks for the response. 
Your tutorial was extremely helpful, and I'm going to generate some wallets with it within the next couple of days. 
The reason I am hesitant to print is because I have no printer that hasn't been plugged into a computer which was connected to the internet. I'm paranoid that the printer might possibly store some data, and then somehow transmit it to the printer. So, I'm thinking I may just buy an $80 printer only for Bitcoin, and also keep the keys on a USB, the old computer, a piece of paper, and printed into metal. Good, right? 
When you say this in step 3: Roll a die 62 times and write down the sequence of numbers. This gives you 2160 possible outcomes, which is the maximum that Bitcoin supports. Unbelievably, You can benefit from buying casino dice for this.
A six sided die is fine, correct? 
My last question: you said you used an old android device with no sim. Do you mean you used that to boot a computer, or you generated the wallets on the old android phone? I'm trying on an android phone and can't get past the "generating Bitcoin addresses..." screen. Also, if you used an android device, how did you get bitaddress.org onto the phone safely? 
Thanks again for your help and the quick responses!

You can download a program called Vanitygen to create addresses with custom characters. Don't use a third party site because they may be able to generate the address you want, but can still keep a copy of the private key. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 12:05:27
No. What it means by private keys is addresses. You'll see that every time you receive money to a new address or send money to a change address the number of "private keys" will go up for that account. 
Your 12 word seed backs up all your accounts, so you don't need a new backup if you add a new account.

Question about Trezor...let's say I have 10 BTC. I send 8 BTC to one Trezor address, 1.5 to another, and .5 to a third address. If I go to send someone .3 BTC, how does it determine which address to send from? If I'm sending .3 BTC I'd prefer it sends from the .5 address for privacy reasons. How does this work?
@_date: 2015-01-17 16:50:56
Is this the news you mentioned here? Or is more coming?
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:58:28
They could eventually integrate stealth addresses for more privacy. Or xpub for unique addresses. We still don't exactly know what reddit plans to do with Bitcoin, though. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 20:59:47
Yes, I want this. I like the idea of smart contracts and all that, but that doesn't help bring crypto to the masses. This is what we need. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 22:44:36

1. Do you mean multisig?  If you want multiple people/keys to sign transactions. Offers better security if done right. 
2. If you want to generate a key with your own entropy. Or if you want to use your own text to create a private key--you can remember the text and recreate the private key from any computer. 
3. If you want custom text in an address. For example, Andreas' fundraising address for Dorian Nakamoto:

I don't really think there is a "best" wallet. It depends on your needs, specifically how paranoid you are :) and how much money you need to store. 
The Ledger HW.1/Nano are good if you are on a budget, and just starting out. You'll need to setup with an offline computer, or using Ledger Starts (a USB bootable OS) if you want it secure. 
The TREZOR is nice since it has a screen, and the seed is generated offline. You can also add a passphrase for extra security. 
The KeepKey is basically just a TREZOR with a larger/digital screen.

You can recover the seed with other wallets like Mycelium, Electrum, or MultiBit HD.

Hey, I’m Jordan, founder of the site. I’ve been into Bitcoin for three years.

Just made some updates that I hope improve the issues you mentioned. Let me know what you think. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 14:34:02
Agreed. It's definitely really hard. I thought about user reviews, but I see with sites like  how manipulated it is (there's money on the table). 
The idea with the "popular tags" is throwing 20 exchanges at someone can make deciding hard, especially first time buyers--who read my site the most. So the popular tags should help making the initial decision easier, but the information is there for further exploration. 
Thanks again for the feedback, will look at implementing some of your tips!

Hi, I'm the owner of BBWW. 
We do use affiliate links when available. They link directly to the exchange. I'm trying to build the best resource I can and without a stream of money I couldn't have translated the site to 13 languages. 
Unlike other sites, I link to all exchanges even when an affiliate program is not available. You'll notice that most of the exchanges don't have affiliate programs. Also, I am constantly rearranging the order of exchanges based on what seems to be used more. 
My goal is to create something that will help new users buy bitcoin. It's taken a lot of time, and as a for profit site I can make it a better and more helpful resource. 
If you have any other questions or concerns feel free to reach out. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 06:06:08

Hi, 
I'm from the US and currently live in Israel. 
Here is my best suggestion. 
Buy bitcoins in the USA at [Coinbase](
That's one of the easiest ways to [buy bitcoins in the US]( 
Then your sister can create an account on [Bit2C]( Once she creates an account ask her to get a deposit address from Bit2C and send you the deposit address. 
Then you send her the bitcoins and they will appear in her account after 3 confirmations. She can then use Bit2C to sell the bitcoins for shekels. She can then transfer shekels to her Israeli bank account. Note that a bank transfer from Bit2C to an Israeli bank account costs 60 shekels. Also her trading the bitcoins to shekels will cost 0.6%. 
Let me know if you need anymore help!

What's the best password manager? I see KeePassx mentioned in the article, but need something that works on both Android, iOS, and desktop.

Did you pay a payment processor like Coinbase or BitPay? If so you'll have to contact those companies. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 06:49:41
There's no way to directly [buy bitcoin via PayPal]( 
But through the above link, it's possible. 
Note that you are going to pay about 9% in fees. It's annoying but still probably the best way. Also you have to buy at least $7 or $8 minimum I think. I'd do $10 minimum just to be safe. 
If you want to try another method try on  but the markup on there will usually be higher than 9%. 
@_date: 2015-11-29 15:42:43
OTC trading group based in New York that specializes in buying and selling large amounts of bitcoin. Genesis actually has a minimum trade size of 25 BTC, but in reality their trades are usually much larger:
“Since September 2013, the Firm has traded over 900,000 Bitcoin (BTC), worth over $360 million United States Dollars, and has completed over 2,400 trades. Genesis makes buying and selling large blocks of digital currency a simple, secure, and supported process.”
If you do the math, it comes out to an average trade of 375 BTC per trade or $150,000 per trade. 
Another New York based exchange, with regular exchange and OTC trading. 
Like Genesis, itBit isn’t open to everyone. Most of its clients include miners, Bitcoin payment processors, and insitutions. You could still try to apply. 
Coinbase is a good option as well. Generally considered an easy place to [buy bitcoin]( Fully verified users can buy up to $50,000 worth of bitcoin per day. 
**Coinbase Exchange**
Coinbase Exchange is a different platform than regular buys from Coinbase. Coinbase Exchange lets users set buy and sell orders, and then matches buyers and sellers through an orderbook. 
One reason to use Coinbase Exchange over Coinbase is because market makers pay no fees. If you put in a buy order and someone sells into your order, you won’t have to pay any fee on your purchase. Even if you become a market taker and buy someone a sell order, the fee is only 0.25%, which is still less than buying directly from Coinbase. 
Not available in every state though:

I was actually writing a post on this now, so I had the information ready. Hope it helps.

There's no way to directly buy bitcoin with [PayPal]( This is because there is a high risk for chargebacks for any merchant who would accept PayPal for Bitcoin. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, paypal transactions are not. PayPal actual bans its merchants from accepting PayPal for bitcoin! 
But through the link above guide, it's possible.
Note that you are going to pay about 9% in fees. It's annoying but still probably the best way. Also you have to buy at least $7 or $8 minimum I think. I'd do $10 minimum just to be safe.

Yes, brain wallet is a section on BitAddress. You can go to  to see it, but don't make a wallet to hold a serious amount of funds while connected to the internet. 
I think brain wallet is a confusing term. My method uses the brain wallet tab on BitAddress, but as you can see it's not exactly a brain wallet. Brain wallet basically just means a user creates the address by hashing something he/she chooses.

I'm also fascinated by this question. I asked Mike Hearn in his AMA but he didn't answer: 
Gavin answered "because I feel cool when I make payments". I'm guessing Hearn would say something similar.
I agree with Trace Mayer. Bitcoin is about sound money and good monetary policy. We need people who are willing to pay to use Bitcoin. That's good. Since Bitcoin provides something that other forms of money can't, it makes sense that it should cost more to use. 
The whole block size debate stems from this as everyone has different ideas about what Bitcoin is or what it should be.

Using Coinbase or Circle as a wallet is asking for trouble. 
Both services allow me to buy Bitcoin quickly. I've never had a problem with either of them. Buy coins, move to my own wallet. If everyone used these services as I do there would be a lot less complaints. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 18:12:17
I just wrote an in-depth guide on [how to buy bitcoin instantly](
If you're in the US your best options are Circle or Changetip. With Circle I'm pretty sure you don't need to provide an ID. You can only buy up to $300 worth of bitcoin per week. 
With Changetip im 99% sure you don't need to provide an ID. But with Changetip you can only buy up to $40 worth of BTC at once.

OP: If you want to avoid the 60 shekel fee you should tell your sister to contact the Bitcoin embassy in Israel: 
They may be able to connect her with a buyer who will pay in cash. That's a bit more difficult since she may not know how to send bitcoins from her wallet. But really the BitEmbassy is great and will be able to help her if she can make a trip there.

Yes. Roll dice let's say 70 times (number needed depends on how many sides the dice have). 
Write down each roll. So let's say you get 6153....163526 (with more random numbers in between). 
Download bitaddress.org from GitHub and put it on a USB. Boot from a live Linux CD, and plug in the USB with bitaddress.
Now you need to hash the number you made with the dice to turn it into a private/public key pair. 
Go to brain wallet and type in the number you made with the dice. Now, since you want everything to be recoverable from one seed, you create each new wallet like this:
{Your dice number/seed}1
{Your dice number/seed}2 
Backup your dice number/seed and you can hash it again whenever you need. You'll just need to add the 1 or 2 at the end. You can use anything, not just 1 and 2 and on. You could use your birth year. It just needs to be something that you can remember, and using single digits doesn't weaken the security so it's better.

2. Yes. The old address will be visible if you go to addresses, then there should be a "used" tab (IIRC). 
3. Yes. Same as a receive address.

If one does a bit of research before sending money to a third party, it's pretty easy not to lose money.

How does BIP70 work?

Do they come out as Buttcoins? Or stay Bitcoin all the way through?

This is just to lower the NYA % so it doesn't hit 95%, which would show how easy it is to activate Segwit normally.

I forget. It either takes from the oldest transaction or the newest. I don't remember. 
You can also right click on addresses and freeze them so they can't be included in any transaction.

Will freeze addresses work with Trezor?

No, the 12 words will backup all transactions made both before and after your wrote down the words.

I plan to have more detailed content that's sortable. PM sent!

Android or iOS? If Android, make a backup:
1. Go to accounts all the way to the left. 
2. Click the menu button (three dots) in the top right. 
3. Tap 'backup'
4. Write down the words on a piece of paper. 
You can import these words into another Mycelium wallet. If anything happens to your phone--app is deleted, phone falls in a pool--you can restore your entire wallet with the 12 words you wrote down.

I thought Electrum was also SPV?
@_date: 2015-02-01 11:38:46
Great. Anyway I only plan to use Electrum. 
Will I be able to set up a Trezor using only Electrum or will I still need myTrezor for that?
@_date: 2015-02-19 14:05:19
Maybe people think that because for some reason the media puts a picture of physical coins in every article about Bitcoin.

Trezor is great because it's easy, secure offline storage but can also be used for daily spending. You can keep all your coins there. They will be safe and if you need to spend it's as easy as spending from a hot wallet.

I love Bitcoin because it is the most honest form of money ever. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 16:40:04
Yes. You create a new wallet, and pick hardware wallet.

What is your response to those who say Chinese exchange volume is fake?
@_date: 2015-02-07 10:12:17
You must trust that Coinbase is using true cold storage. Honestly, it is probably a very secure option but here are the problems:
1) privacy- Coinbase knows your balance, all transactions, etc. If this doesn't bother you then disregard
2) You don't control the keys- this is the bigger issue. Coinbase can pretty much tell you at any time that you can't access your coins. 
So yes, it is very unlikely that your coins will actually be stolen from Coinbase's vault. But this doesn't mean there is no way you could lose access. 
If you don't control the actual private keys they are not your coins.

These are only for Bitcoin. The hardware wallets like TREZOr and Ledger Nano S will also work with some altcoins. 
Best multi-currency wallet is Jaxx

I haven't used the iOS version, but I'd guess that it does.

Bitcoin is constantly getting less volatile 
@_date: 2015-02-25 17:48:51
You can change the settings. Basically it will recommend a fee but still let you change it as you go to make the transaction.

I'm working on a website that has extensive overviews of all Bitcoin wallets. My goal is to make it easy to compare Bitcoin wallets and pick the right one for your specific needs. Everything is still in progress, but I'd like to get some early feedback. Anyone interested in taking a look?
