It helps that Singapore's Prime Minister is a [Senior Wrangler]( who is capable of writing [a clean yet complex Sudoku Solver in C]( And his latest National Day speech called for an integrated digital payment solution (sounds familiar?) to be developed.

Definitely. Look at gold - we had to mine enough of it in the first place and have it commonplace enough for everyone to start recognising its value...

Me! Bought more, in fact! 
I don't believe in the banking system any more.

1) There will be a mass transfer of BTCs from Mt.Gox to other exchanges simply because people don't trust Mt.Gox any more.
2) There will be those who queued the coin trades and forgot to cancel it - a mini-sale will ensue.
3) The mini-sale will push the value down, which will then drive BTC purchasing.
I don't think BTC will reach the heights of $200 within this week, but it should steadily climb by the end of the month.

Just the news, generally. I subscribe to Fortune 500, Newsweek (when it was still a magazine), Time and follow the news closely.
The dealings of the banking industry is from top-bottom (meaning they favour their own board, prioritise profits ahead of consumers). 
As a consumer, it doesn't really give me much faith in them.

Don't 'invest' in Bitcoins. Buy it, use it, help spread it around. Be part of it.
