I haven't but I can
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:57:53
I tried. It never went through, seller wont respond and they wont let me try again until that clears or something.
I give up. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:34:44
I would buy now
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:59:09
It sent a numeric code to my phone to put in. Then I scanned my bitcoin address code. That is where it put the bitcoins.
I dont know if it had a camera.

I wish I believed in hell so I could believe they are going there. It's just fucking mean.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:23:31
If someone is so easily persuaded by such a thing, they aren't going to be buying bitcoins anyways.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:56:23
Find an ATM. You can't trade, but you can buy

They keep forgetting to include that "reportedly" in the articles...and yes people are buying with credit cards because that is one easy, fast way to buy online. It doesn't mean they are going into debt to do so.
Inflammatory bullshit.

They have some really restrictive laws so the exchanges wont touch anything to do with it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:08:00
No one can answer that. This is why investing is risky. You do your research, make your own best guess and do what you want to do.
A good rule is not to invest anything you can't stand to lose. Do not invest your rent money, expecting to make money before the first! Do not ever invest money in anything and expect to make a particular amount of money in a particular time. It doesn't work that way unless you are looking for &lt;1% interest from a bank.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:08:02
Buy a little bit at a time. There's no guarantees on earnings.
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:41:41
Doesn't matter what it is. I am hoping for a big dip so I can buy more.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:22:28
You have no idea what I have or what I don't.
You know what happens when you assume, right? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:33:43
If you cash out a bunch, go talk to an accountant. You likely need to pay estimated taxes to avoid penalties at the end of the year. This would apply if you are selling at a different time. It's December, so you are good. Just plan on having to pay some when you file.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:46:32

If people like you had not been spending bitcoin and working towards it's growth and acceptance, then none of us would be here today.
You didn't spend it, you invested in it and now it really is paying off. You did a good thing.

@_date: 2017-12-08 06:28:34
If you are using something to track your coins for taxes, why doesn't allow you to show where you have transferred them to? 
You need something that shows more than simply buying and selling them because there is more to the game than that.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:44:35
I would read how it is worded really carefully. I believe they ask about bank accounts, stocks,etc.
They dont ask about bitcoin and its really not classified as anything else so I'd go with...um...NO!
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:23:16
They won't take anyone from Wyoming and I can't fudge that as all my cards have that billing address
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:43:19
I dont know
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:33:55
Who tells them they have to monitor it? Who do they report that info too? I am assuming it's some government thing like them tracking large deposits and whatnot.
I'm just curious.

Whipspawn....those who sell only to rebuy

Ok. That's what I thought.

Where are you from? You can't get an account if you are from Wyoming and I think Minnesota and Hawaii too.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:54:02
I used mycelium but there is also electrum and some others. I can't remember where I saw which ones to use. They are phone based but eventually you want to move it to an offline deal but I haven't done that yet.
Sorry, I am very new also but so far this has worked for me.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:22:00
Yes. You need to give changetip your wallet address and then it will be on your phone. It may take it awhile because everything is working pretty slow. There will also be a fee...not sure how much. 
I got an old changetip about a week ago.  It was .50 and now it's like $20!
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:01:05
I just spent $300 of bitcoin while I was watching the price go up, up, up. I did it because I got a good deal on the thing I wanted, so I bought it. I am happy with that decision, even though I think bitcoin will be over $20k by tomorrow.
You can't look back at your decisions through the lens of highsight, unless you want to live a life of regret and second guessing everything you have ever been. Screw that.
Just do what you need to do, or want to do, and don't look back.
Edit: Highsight? Really? Meh, you all know what I mean.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:27:47
Find an ATM. That's what I had to do. I live in a stupid state where the exchanges won't operate, but I work in Louisiana. 
Look there for one. If you have multiple ones, check the rates and go with the cheapest. It's easy and straightforward to buy from them. No ID, just a phone with a wallet on it....and cash
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:11:10

The longer the blockchain gets the harder it is to mine as the computations get more complicated (I think anyways. I am new too). 
I do know that you can't mine bitcoin anymore with a regular PC. I think you can mine other cryptos that way and then trade them in. Do some research and good luck
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:58:54
How can we see these types of volumes when exchanges cannot keep up with what we have now?

Apmex itself is reputable. This guy bought an Apmex product, but not from Apmex.
I buy metals from Apmex all the time.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:02:19
Nope. Not if you are from Wyoming
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:02:42
I have bought from an ATM because I literally had no other choice. The ATM charged me 15% over the bitcoin price. So if it was $10000, I would pay $11500. 
It sucks but that is the only way I could buy it. I have more than made up for it though with the increase in prices.
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:08:37

Most of the people who trade commodity futures like cattle and grain are not farmers and dont own any actual cattle or grain.
They just bet whether prices will go up or down.

I have no method to try to convince anyone to do anything. This is my own plan.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:17:39
Yeah. I bet it will be 50K by the time futures open.
I base that on the fact that a cattle contract is about that much. How small is too small for those guys? We are gonna be big enough by then
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:40:13

@_date: 2017-12-10 06:35:10
Yeah, people here are very helpful here until you start with the attitude. Your attitude in responding to Dima420 prompted my response.
Bitcoin requires a certain measure of personal responsibility. Those who don't embrace that end up losing their coins by not holding their own keys or forget where they are.
There are no "multitudes of recovery systems" I guess because the system wasn't set up for people who trust their information to others.
No one is trying to attack you for this...you aren't alone, but just chill the fuck out, be nice and maybe someone will help you. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:42:38
20k by the time futures start

I can't get my bank account to work either. I'm on Gemini and the alternative is to initiate a wire transfer from my bank to them. I haven't done it yet.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:16:10
They will grow no matter where they are.
You should store them in a wallet over which you have the private keys. Do not keep them on an exchange.
Preferably, you store them in cold storage, off line somewhere.
I am new too, but this much I know.

Apmex and provident metals. They sell gold and silver and they take bitcoin. I think a bunch of other metal dealers do as well.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:04:36
I am in the same boat but I live in Wyoming. I went with the ATM.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:40:09
They don't understand it and you aren't going to convince them.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:12:40
Apparently Wyoming likes bitcoins about as much as they like weed.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:27:20
I get off work in half an hour and am going to buy some more at an ATM. Its gonna be 16k by then.

Mind your own business. It sounds like they are just doing things differently than you would do. Now, if they can't pay their rent, you might have an issue, but until then, leave them be.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:28:33
I bought my first yesterday and then bought some more today. I had to use an ATM. I more than made up the markup on yesterdays purchase and already almost there on todays. Buy!

I have lived over 50 years on this planet. I am sure I could find a myriad of ways I could have become rich..."If only..."
If only I had maxed out my 401k from the very first day they came out.
If only I had stayed with the first "real" job I ever had.
If only I had completed college before I was in my 40's.
I could go on and on.
The point is that we all do what we have to do to get by in life. I have made the best choices I could at the time. Hindsight does not give us the power to change the past, but only to learn from it...and sometimes there really isn't anything to learn.
You paid for school. That's not a bad choice. It was the best thing you could do at the time. Don't beat yourself up over it. 
There will be more opportunities in life and honest to god...money can't buy you everything. I honestly would not trade the life I have lived for having won the lottery or something when I was young. I've had way more fun, done way more stuff, built awesome relationships, etc.
Everything is gonna be ok.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:31:01
I got this. I am not easily spooked. Been around enough to know that money comes and money goes, but bitcoin is more than that.

Speaking of getting caught with your pants down...have you managed to recover the money you so foolishly lost???
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:49:28
The risk seems to be more from when you DON'T handle your own bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:30:45
It's easier for me to buy gold with bitcoin than it would be to buy anything with gold.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:23:26
Also...do not lose the key to that wallet or your money is gone forever. The word that you have to do...write them down and save them. I also took a picture of mine and backed that up like 15 times. There is more about how to store stuff safely but for now, that will work.

You can check all the ATMs. I happen to work in Louisiana so that is how I was able to use and ATM. The closest one was like 14% but there was another a bit further away for 10%. 
I can't say that I tried every single exchange. I did get close using mycelium. They use Simplex to process payments. They actually accepted my credit card, but it took them so long, they cancelled the deal because the market had moved too much. It was also a pretty big premium though.
Localbitcoin has options, but again, I couldn't get any of them to work, probably because they were overwhelmed. In the end, the ATM just was the easiest way. You are probably going to pay a premium no matter what you do, unless you buy straight from someone else. 
Being on an island probably doesn't help.
Someone on here generously offered to sell me a small amount after I posted a similar post as yours (but mine had way more profanity lol). I bought that using google wallet and trusting a fellow redditor. 
I don't think you can post on here looking to buy but maybe there's another place you can? Or maybe someone will see this and offer. Just be careful as there are lots of scammers running around.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:25:47
Hawaii, Minnisota and Wyoming have some stupid rules that don't allow the exchanges to work there. You can't get around it with a VPN because they want a state ID. Hypothetically, someone could use an ID, such as a passport, that has no address, but hypothetically, they won't accept that.
Even if you get past the ID, your bank account routing number gives it away....at least mine does...and my credit card billing address is in Wyoming so that doesn't work.
It sucks
