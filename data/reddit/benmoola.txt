Good point, though surely we can think of a way around such tricks?  And it would be optional anyway. Could your 500 zombie nodes harm the network?
@_date: 2015-12-26 00:29:00
Why not build in an optional compensation system into the next version of bitcoin core. I suppose, though, that there is no way to find the public address of a bitcoin node through it's IP address? Imagine the number of full nodes popping up when people hear there is money in it.  BTW, I run 4 full nodes ;)

One of my clients was hit with Cyyptxxx and opted to pay the ransom located on page   He paid it and 72 hours later, no "ultradecypter". I just wanted to spread the word

This was just a happenstance. Thought I would share it
@_date: 2017-07-29 05:36:27
I actually got ahold of a few of their 500GH units, which didn't work for crap unless the room was 20 degrees. So I disassembled them and ran them as 60GH units. My electric bills were incredible.
@_date: 2017-07-29 07:12:25
Agreed, I copied them off today. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 07:23:45

@_date: 2017-07-29 07:18:15
No one would believe that. Maybe if it said 2011
@_date: 2017-07-29 07:24:56
