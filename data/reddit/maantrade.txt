What does the 1.5btc capacity mean? Is that the value of the combined "deposits" across all the nodes? 
@_date: 2018-08-13 01:00:55
Came here to ask just that. All promises and vapour. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 12:32:01
Was enjoying this until the said theyre issuing their own coin for it. 
@_date: 2017-02-17 03:51:48
One whose term ends this year the other next year. Not much to lose at this point.
@_date: 2017-02-27 03:49:11
Was though. Theyre extinct now.

Like most of these articles, needs to put his money where his mouth is.

I have seen no proof that he's actually building anything. Just a few tweets pumping it. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 11:13:42
If Luke is indeed coding this, thank you Luke. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 04:57:42
Seriously. At this rate Im going to have to sell some coins to buy enough popcorn to keep up!
@_date: 2017-03-21 11:36:31
Oh cool! Great for those of us out east!
@_date: 2017-03-24 23:11:18
Yes, exactly this
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:05:30
It at least Singapore and HK for sure. Didnt know they were operating in Japan though..?
@_date: 2017-03-06 12:52:39
Yeh, where the hat bro?
@_date: 2017-03-21 03:52:24
I hope EVERYONE working on Core is serious and engages in negotiating with him on this.
@_date: 2017-03-19 06:27:17
How do you see it playing out? (Genuinely interested.)
@_date: 2017-03-23 09:02:53
Guess its time to buy again once these threads come along.
@_date: 2017-03-23 05:15:59
100% agree. Upgrade to 2mg with the Segwit option. This will get us some breathing room, and might get Core enough goodwill from the miners to actually activate Segwit.

"The world’s biggest cryptocurrency mining company is going through tough times. But a code change in bitcoin might come to the rescue, again."
The halving isn't a code change, is it. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 01:56:14
Thank you nullc for answering. Another question then if I may, on the same line. I read somewhere a while back (6+ months maybe) that a 2mg version of the current (at the time) Core software was in testing. Is that true? And if so, in terms of the software only (i.e. ignoring the politics for a moment), is this a viable option to put forward?

@_date: 2017-03-30 09:25:25
At the least, it's regulatory clarify which gives big players comfort in investing in the space. GMO and SBI are both excellent examples of companies ready to start bitcoin related business after this. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 01:48:09
Then I hope they're all happy being powerful yet poor.
@_date: 2017-01-10 02:54:48


Great, thanks.
@_date: 2017-01-07 02:32:12
This is the real news here. Sounds reasonable to me. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 03:19:49
HFT, IMO.
@_date: 2017-01-18 04:36:03
Agree. Buy him a beer and change the conversation. I have stopped talking about in person it since it passed around 500. Just quietly enjoying it with you anonymous people on the internet!
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:44:09
Which brewery?
@_date: 2017-08-18 10:51:44
So what?
@_date: 2018-10-18 15:01:31
Bitpay maybe?
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:14:37
In my opinion, I want to assume that those companies who signed their names on an agreement, will indeed follow through with that promised, and we will see a 2x chain. Also a company such as Gemini, who has not signed on specifically, has stated in their ETF proposal that to them bitcoin will be the one with the most hashpower (I think), and thus if the miners support 2x as they promised, its safe to assume they would support it. 
Having said that, its a shit show, and the uncertainty is not helping things at all.
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:13:36
They "..interviewed thirty of the leading bitcoin companies from across the globe. It found a consensus view that bitcoin will become the sixth largest global reserve currency within 15 years."
@_date: 2019-06-10 00:40:48
Not enough.
@_date: 2019-06-14 07:35:02
Exactly my reaction. Word for word.
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:30:59
ETH is waiting for you.
@_date: 2017-11-01 08:57:48
Wheres the BCH address then?
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:15:14
Thanks Mike! I listened days back, and really enjoyed the show! Thanks for continuing to be interested in and learning about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:15:58
This is the biggest news today.
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:53:58
What I came here to ask
@_date: 2017-04-03 04:38:28
As I posted recently, "At the least, this provides regulatory clarify which gives big players comfort in investing in the space. GMO and SBI are both excellent examples of companies ready to start bitcoin related business after this."
@_date: 2017-04-01 02:50:42
Excellent. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-04-05 05:32:53
I bought some too
@_date: 2017-04-06 06:41:49
Damn right it is. You couldn't write this shit.
@_date: 2017-04-29 17:41:41
I forgot who it was yesterday, but someone gave an interesting theory about much of the alt growth being due to bitcoin leverage. Buy btc, (btc goes up) use btc to buy alts on leverage (alts go up), sell alts for profit and buy back into btc (btc goes up). 
@_date: 2017-04-14 05:50:38
Which blockchain?
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:43:43
Once it started getting some use (thanks to speculation) it became clear that it wasn't scalable for daily spending and fees were too high. And thus the "store of value only" idea was born. Ideally once we scale, it fulfils both needs.
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:11:16
FUD. Read the original documents, not some random tweet. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:58:50
"The currency code must be three uppercase characters; passing in anything else will throw an error.
'PaymentRequest': '...' is not a valid ISO 4217 currency code, should be 3 upper case letters [A-Z]
You can pass in any three characters and it will be treated as a valid currency code.The reason for this is that it allows support for future currencies. For example, Bitcoin can be supported with its currency code 'XBT'."
@_date: 2017-09-09 08:27:04
GMO, and DMM, huge! 
@_date: 2018-02-19 08:04:45
Yes, do not buy Bitcoin Crap! Bcrap neither. Scammy forks those.

It's all coded up, running on test net and ready to go. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 09:15:19
$14 for me. And very easy too!
@_date: 2017-10-02 05:38:32
The non-drama answer to 7. is that any chain with hash-power could have value. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 08:05:58
I found the part about 2x and bcash very interesting. He was humble enough to say he was proven wrong and explained why. (Unlike other talking heads out there who wont admit it.)
@_date: 2017-10-01 11:14:13
Lots of paid shills. Everyone has to earn a living somehow, but I'd prefer if they went back to working on the Donald...
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:52:02
So.. if the miners all switch to B2X.. and then say a week later switch back to B1X... and the chain with the most difficulty keeps changing, logistically/operationally how confusing is that going to be for their customers who want "btc"? 
Edit: This is not rhetorical, I'm actually asking if anyone has any idea. Because others like Gemini (in their ETF filing I think) have also defined btc as that having the longest chain and/or most difficulty. How is this going to work?
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:31:01
Heck no. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:31:00
@_date: 2019-09-16 12:21:39
Just shows how much Yang doesn’t understand bitcoin. Or economics for that matter. Regardless, I’d be very happy for him to try and buy enough bitcoin to be able to pay in btc!
@_date: 2018-07-27 12:04:04
Zero. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 09:05:02
Thats what I thought! Is this true?
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:49:17
@_date: 2017-05-18 07:28:10
Damn right. Thank you Barry. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 07:58:32

Pegasus, haven't seen you around for a while. Miss your awesome optimistic comments!
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:02:16
Yes, very much so. And they should take him up on his offer to help too.
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:44:01

@_date: 2017-07-17 04:14:45
Only if you assume any wisdom at all :)
@_date: 2017-07-15 10:33:56
Depends which exchange. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 07:11:48
The BU scare was an awesome buy opportunity. Scary at the time though, but you need to overcome that to profit.
@_date: 2018-12-06 08:06:07
Sweet, thanks!

Are you fucking kidding me? Do any of you non-Japanese out there know how massive Felica is? EVERY ONE of the 125 million Jaoanese, assuming they can walk, has some form of Felica card. Primarily Suica for getting the train and bus, and oh, buying stuff at like any of the million convenience stores in Japan. The payment is instant. For iPhones in Japan, Apple Pay also used Felica technology in the special chip in iPhone 7s. Japan was late to launch Apple Pay cause Sony gave them a hurry up as the confirmation time was too slow, so theyre serious about making a quality user experience. 
If this is even close to true and we become able to load bitcoin onto ANY Felica card... then holy shit..
