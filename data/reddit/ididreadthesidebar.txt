I brought BCH at the lows, and considering selling it off to buy some more BTC while it's correcting. Just not sure about BCHs future.

Listen, I have done a lot of stupid shit in my life. This is far from stupid (for me).

If I didn't have any basic knowledge of BTC, this would not be something along the lines of ELI5

Ha General Bytes is the machine I was looking at and also just watched a couple of their YT videos. Are you affiliated with GB? Either way, you mind if I message you?

Not everyone has a bank account and some banks even decline charges for bitcoin purchase. These machines take cash and can create a paper wallet instantly.
Also, you can purchase anonymously depending on your state requirements.
And it's also convenient.

True. I've seen lower fees though in less competing areas 5-7%.
However, I'm just looking more information on startup costs and the legalities of the entire process.

Some machines allow two way, buy and sell.
