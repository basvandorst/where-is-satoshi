DONT give anyone pics or code's or anything untill you understand what you are doing, ESPECIALLY a picture of a big square code looking thing that says private key, or the long code that is associated with it.

What is this shit?
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:11:34
Sure, but anyone that claims to know what bitcoin is going to do is either lying to you or themselves or both.

So this is basically a super high level hackers candy shop of who to target next... Just remember, you can keep your wallets as safe as they can get, but posting about having a shit ton of btc isn't a good idea. It's not that hard to link reddit accounts to real names and addresses, and eventually people are going to start to make house calls when they know how easy it is to make millions by forcing someone to transfer out their cryptos.
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:25:59
Y'all are acting like it's 10 BTC, 4k is a drop in the bucket for starting and business from scratch.

Yes, I'm fimilar with fractional reserve banking. That being said, next time you want to buy a house or a car, create some money out of nothing like they do and let me know how that works out for ya.

Well to each his own, but I disagree, a badly setup paper wallet by someone that has no experience on a infected computer or even worse a wallet on an infected computer. 
In this situation, someone that has a hardware wallet on order, and next to zero knowlage about bitcoin, I stand behind my suggestion of a major exchange for a temporary place to store them.
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:41:11
It's simple cause and effect. People that boast about how much money they made make themselves huge targets.

The difference between normal millionaires and crypto millionaires is pretty simple. 
Bitcoin millionaire: A bad guy tracks down the average bitcoin millionaire all he has to do is show up with a gun and say "transfer all of your bitcoin to my wallet or I'll shoot you in the head." Once the transfer is complete, the thief disappears into the night. End of story. The BTC isn't insured case closed, it's gone. 
Millionaire: The guy shows up at the house says the same stuff. What do you expect to happen? He logs onto his bank account online and transfers the money to another bank account? You could always argue the kidnapping thing, but that's way too hardcore for most people, and for the people it's not too hardcore for, they do it. Seems pretty obvious to me.
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:27:23
Yea that was super short lived, already back down.
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:52:36
W/e that's my opinion, take it or leave it, idc.
@_date: 2018-03-05 23:35:31
Boitcin has full fungibility. There's no such thing as "tainted coins".
@_date: 2018-02-18 17:05:58

Please, you don't know a thing about hodling if your jumping ship now!
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:50:59
And people wonder how they get targeted for attacks. People like you that flaunt their thousands/millions are going to be the first when people start tracking down crypto holders and making in person visits. 
Imagine this, BTC hits 100k, let's assume you have 100 BTC like you claim, that's 10 million USD. Once bad guys start to realize that going to your house and forcing a transaction will make them 10 million, people like you are fucked. 
I'm bored at work, and on a phone and it took me all of 7 min to figure out your a 30 year old white male living near San Fransisco and in-between your YouTube, OkCupid, and gethub accounts, there are more than enough pictures and details even a child could find you with any amount of serious legwork, and I didn't even look at all your comments, just breezed over your posts.

While you wait for a good solution  like a hardware wallet I would say Coinbase would be a good short term option. I know that you don't really own any coin you don't have the key for but in this situation it's probably your safest option.
@_date: 2017-10-10 08:34:38
1. Don't keep any appreciable amount on the laptop, keep it in the trezor
2. Don't tell random internet people you have a bunch of bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-30 05:00:20
Pretty sure OP is the author.
@_date: 2017-09-28 07:38:09
Hardware wallet or a correctly made paper wallet for long term hodling. As for small amounts, mycelium is good.
@_date: 2017-10-29 08:54:13
Don't be stupid. Obviously he isn't mining BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:58:02
Well, consitering your sitting on over half a million now, I would imagine that is a real problem now, but u do u.
@_date: 2017-10-10 07:54:26
Hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:15:49
@_date: 2017-10-10 08:35:42
So you have 100 now?
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:51:31
There probably is. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:51:17
Selling those individualy will get you more BTC than that thing will mine in 100 years.
@_date: 2017-09-28 08:16:32
That's a very subjective question, every person has a different number for what is too much. 
Personally I think anything over 1000USD should not be anywhere but a secure hardware wallet. Coinbase or any of the major exchanges is more than safe enough for any amount of BTC for temporary storage until you get a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-01 06:35:10
This is all a big mistake, I thought your first response, this one 
"You use a lot of big and hostile words without saying why you feel the way you feel.
Learn how to have a decent conversation and then start refuting people with proper arguments."
was for me, but I now realize that it was for the guy calling BS. Sorry about all the confusion. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 08:32:29
Ledger had nothing to do with it, he just owned one but never used it.
