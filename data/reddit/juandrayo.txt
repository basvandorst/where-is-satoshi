The more people that get in, the better it is for us. As long as they're doing it right, growth will be stimulated

I tend to ignore her cause I'm looking at graphs and reading posts on reddit.

I'm seriously considering selling my car for BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:08:26
I fucked up really bad by selling 1.01 litecoin to buy BTC at 13.8k this saturday. How can I avoid making those mistakes? 
I also heard that it's important to stimulate the bitcoin economy by making transactions. Although I don't buy physical stuff, I buy more bitcoin. Just in small increments. Is that really making a difference? Should I just save up to buy at one exchange rate? What do you guys suggest?

I find it amazing that in a couple of years we could see this meme again but with the caption at 10k.

Shit, I'll take 0.1 BTC hahahaha
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:56:18
I'm buying all the bitcoin I can. Seriously, fuck doing anything but buying Bitcoin right now. The price of this shit is going to only keep on increasing dramatically. Exponential growth is beautiful. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:30:38
I'm glad I did. After realizing that I had 8 measly cents turn into 8 dollars, I knew I had to pour into this shit. I sold my car to buy btc at 10,900

Probably is dude. :(

I thought about that. She is a jewelry designer and she generates a lot of revenue each month.
I'm gonna open up that idea today. I feel like she would appreciate that.

Taking a shit while looking at coinbase ahaha

It's beautiful. It's really reinforcing me to buy more. I love seeing it skyrocket after the overnight/overseas Asian trades. I love seeing the dips at 11pm, 5pm, 9pm EST of people selling. It's fantastic. I love how the price just slightly wobbles around the ATH after some big trades/sells and consequent buys/new ppl including me.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:40:59
Awesome job guys.

Chargeback risks are huge for many businesses and this eliminates them completely.

Usually an enthusiastic yes or cold no. I have done business with some merchants who have told me no and have inquired because of its popularity. I always do my best to promote it and have been successful in some cases. My local supplement shop accepts bitcoin, a smoothie spot i love accepts bitcoin, even some fashion clothing store that I went to for my cousin's birthday gifts accepted crypto. Generally, the young business owners are open to the crypto payment whereas our older counterparts quickly refute its business potential.

I work part time at my mother's jewelry business. I just implemented bitcoin as a form of payment and people are pleasantly surprised. My elders are not keen to the idea of hodling. They usually convert to fiat instantly but I ask for my commission and wages in bitcoin. Personally, I love getting paid in bitcoin.
