I got into BTC about 2010/2011 when I first heard about through word-of-mouth via University.
I thought the idea behind it was fantastic and as stated thought it would be a good way to stick two fingers up to "the man" and had some seriously interesting technology involved.
The first BTC I got was mail order (no idea how I didn't get scammed) and a physical exchange, absolute madness before exchanges (and Mt. Gox) were even a thing. I think I bought about $30 of weed using god-knows how many BTC at that time.
I went on to lose my wallet containing BTC through a mixture of idiocy &amp; poor planning. Not much you can do there, live and learn.
What I did notice though is the community went from being very tech focused "community" driven .. to greed driven. Nothing but greed &amp; people fucking other people over for money. I feel it lost its soul somewhere in the process.
I'm hoping this incoming massive dip might weed out those've infiltrated the community for a quick $$ and bring it back it its roots, but, I think that's wishful thinking.

You know it! I'm just hoping it doesn't do it before payday. Just keep dropping for another week, thanks.

I think that's the million dollar question. How do you stop it? I think perhaps keeping the "coin" at a moderate value and keeping the technical news at the forefront.
I have hopes for ARK as so far it ticks all the boxes I've been looking for. It's just a royal PITA to buy any.

I've been watching BTC for a very, very long time and by todays standards I bought a pizza worth about £100,000+ back in 2011 .. then lost my wallet containing all my BTC. C'est la vie.
But I absolutely believe this is the beginning of a .COM bubble burst; everything is virtually the same about it but in a different setting.
I still think it'll normalize (and I hope it does) to a decent $$ but I don't think the lofty goals of $100,000 per coin will happen. Especially when Governments don't get the juicy, juicy $$ .. oh and money laundering .. and better BlockChain tech being on the market.

I think BitCoin lost its way the moment it went out of the hands of the technically-minded and into the pockets of big business &amp; investors.  Now it's just seen as a greed machine, which is a shame.

Absolutely; I have massive respect for those who try to keep the idea alive but I feel BTC has now become so tainted it's unrecognisable. Outside of holding (very small) amounts of BTC I keep a massive distance.
Plus; most people in the community are now cunts. Just like when "Coke" and profits flooded the DarkNet markets.

Goddamnit! This is making my drugs more expensive!

But I am in GB! It's down about 4BTC for a whopping £50. It's getting silly expensive.
