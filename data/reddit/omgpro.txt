Can't tell if serious
@_date: 2014-05-03 22:07:18


When was that anyways? The 60s and 70s?
@_date: 2014-11-29 17:23:15
Yup that's what I used, followed the guide on TAILS website and used the TAILS setting in the program itself. 
@_date: 2014-10-31 18:28:06
Also, what happens after the last block is mined? No more transactions?
@_date: 2014-10-23 18:17:28
He didn't delete his account. His account's always been like that. Not sure why, possibly something to do with the hyphens?
@_date: 2014-11-29 17:16:02
Yeah I honestly think it's just something with the drive, since there are multiple other drives documented not to play nice with TAILS
@_date: 2014-11-29 16:24:44
I checked all the known issues I could find and nothing helped. I should have filed a report but was honestly too lazy. It seemed similar to the cases they had of certain drives being incompatible but wasn't exactly the same. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 20:04:35
The irony here is palpable.
@_date: 2014-12-24 16:52:06


Not FBI, but yeah most likely something like that....
@_date: 2014-10-31 16:26:53
Pretty good. But I still can't figure out how and/or where this non-transaction information is stored on the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-11-29 21:01:31
Ah, ok. So I just tried to download and install everything fresh. Now I remember what was happening, because the same thing happens. When it tries to boot, it says no configuration found right away.
@_date: 2014-12-24 16:49:00
Of course, keep in mind that 'not illegal' doesn't necessarily mean 'legal'.

Well, there are countries that officially use USD as their currency, as well as others where USD is circulated fairly widely.

A company is both making a good name for themselves by accepting bitcoins while simultaneously encouraging the bitcoin economy to be more legitimate. This sounds like a great thing. But you think it's a bad thing?

I still don't understand what the fuck kind of 11th grade teacher assigns a Dan Brown book. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 17:52:02
I think I did not run it as admin so that might make it work, thanks

I had the same problem with multiple motherboards. It was just such a strange thing, I don't remember exactly but even though I followed exactly how they recommended to create it from Windows it would not play nice with the syslinux file if I remember correctly? What ever file the boot loader looks for. I 
 trying to rename files and move them around (like from / to /boot) based on the errors. I would just end up with more errors so I gave up.

How is bitcoin any more "Magic Internet Money" than depositing money into chips and using those?
@_date: 2014-10-31 14:26:13
You got any good links explaining how the blockchain works? Something that isn't afraid to scare away the reader with math, but also doesn't just devolve into a bunch of math exercises I don't care to do.
@_date: 2014-12-24 17:12:31
How can you tell it's multi-sig?
@_date: 2014-11-29 16:02:25
I bought a Kingston USB drove to use TAILS with, and it just... didn't work. Wouldn't boot no matter what I tried so I gave up
@_date: 2014-11-29 17:07:38
Yes haha, I'm not completely new to this, I used to install Gentoo for fun and have a degree in electrical engineering (although I haven't played with Linux in a few years)

That's a pretty dumb assumption. Sure, if you really want to avoid paying ATM fees, you have plenty of options. But there are more important things to consider when choosing a bank account that might take precedence here.
@_date: 2015-05-16 14:40:22
Don't people say that there is Bitcoin, and then there are bitcoins? You can possess bitcoins, but you can't posses Bitcoin, it's the entire concept.

And if pacifism was globally adopted, there would be no more wars. Unfortunately, we live in reality.

But...the stealing a car and driving around and then lighting it on fire can make sense.

The problem with casino dice is that they're made to be rolled on a relatively soft felt table/wall corner, and are changed out regularly. If you try to roll them on a hard surface they will not roll much at all, limiting their effectiveness as random, and they will become damaged , limiting that randomness even more.

Please think about whether what you are saying makes any sense before you post it.

$200 dollars (plus electricity) every 2 and a half months is a fairly significant amount of money for something that is unnecessary.
@_date: 2013-12-11 02:10:47
No they aren't. Some teachers are just dicks. 
Let me preface this by saying I am someone who hardly truly "believes" in anything, in that there aren't any ideas I won't consider and reconsider ad infinitum depending on the changing of my thoughts and the changes of the world around me. But there is one thing I know I will always believe and there's nothing that can change it. And that thing is that education is the singular most important thing for advancing our society and humanity as a whole, and that education should be given way way more respect and money and attention.
But what you're saying is just cynical bullshit. Yes, there are way too many teachers who cannot tolerate creativity, but that's actually not a problem with the education system and more a problem with humanity and how we mature into being uncomfortable with unfamiliar ideas.
There are many things wrong with the American education system and education systems abroad, but there are plenty of schools and teachers out there who encourage creativity. Not enough, but they are there. And you being overly cynical isn't helping anyone but making yourself and other people who are set in their anti school ways feel better about themselves.

Doesn't that mean that Ferraris are all Fiats then? I mean whatever, it was just a joke.
So what do you think then? Will Kimi be able to keep up with Fernando?
