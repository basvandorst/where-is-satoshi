Update 7-19-2017 (Wednesday): I received a follow-up email from Mr. R. Alexander who apologized for the delay due to 
a high volume of orders for a small business. I received a refund in the full amount. 
So it is not a scam after all, just keep in mind that placing scheduled orders is improbable. 
This website is more intended for same-day deliveries.
Long story shortened: 
On July 12 (Wednesday) I placed an order on pizzaforcoins.com for delivery next day Jul.13 at lunch time. 
In steps 5 &amp; 6 on the ordering page there are 2 text fields for special notes, so wrote in each "for Thursday @ 10:30". 
The transaction went through without a hitch but then Dominos tried delivering twice on Wednesday (same day) after business hours. 
Turns out Dominos was actually paid in 2 transactions by gift cards, that's why they had 2 different orders.
Dominos refunded the gift card transactions and attempted to reschedule for Thursday Jul_13. 
But of course I've no knowledge of these "gift cards" so I could not use them to pay Dominos on delivery. 
They had no indication that the gift cards came from pizzaforcoins.com, instead they thought I placed the order directly.
I cancelled the order with Dominos and requested a refund through pizzaforcoins.com.
Next day I placed a follow-up call, nothing happened. At this point it sure seemed like I got scammed without recourse, 
so I posted negative reviews on several websites. 
Pizza For Coins people saw the review(s) and processed my refund request.
