There is an easy solution to high fees.  Just hold.

Excellent answer.  Exactly what I was looking for.  I was simply musing about how what gives bitcoin security is that it is very difficult to guess sometimes private key.  Then I got to wondering exactly how hard it is to guess.

How do exchanges get around capital drain?
Example of what I mean:
New exchange opens with $1m usd in capital. And allows bitcoin to be bought and sold for cash.
Because of the nature of bitcoin, there is no way for the exchange to control the total value of the bitcoin in their customers accounts to make sure they remain solvent.  I.e. enough people move money into the exchange (2mill worth) and try to sell their bitcoin and bam, the exchange has to put a good on selling bitcoin. 
This causes trust issues with that exchange burying them under lack of cash though in this case they may have bitcoin up the wazoo.  But to continue their business they need a vast sum of bitcoin as well as a vast sum of cash and enough control over deposits and withdrawals on both sides to be able to normalize the flow.  
A similar issue happens on the other side of the coin when people are trying to exchange dollars for bitcoin.
It's almost like an exchange should never use its own bitcoin/cash in their exchange activities. Unless there is a way for them to be insured on both sides of the coin (cash and btc).
I haven't researched mtcgox much so forgive me if this is what they tried to do and I just want paying attention.  What would happen if an exchange were set up such that it is just a medium to connect people with cash that want bitcoin and people with bitcoin that wasn't cash.  Like placing buy and sell orders, the exchange holds the money/btc in a trust until the order is either executed or expires.  If the order is executed, then the money/btc gets exchanged (cash guy gets btc in an account they specify, btc huy gets cash in an account they specify).  Otherwise, the btc/cash gets forwarded to an account specified at the time it was created.  
Less like a bank and more like a stock market.
Until we have that in a reliable method, we will just get more and more failed exchanges.  Am I crazy?  Misinformed? Or talking sense?

You still have access to any principal you invest in a roth IRA.  You can pull that out tax free at any time.  You just can't put it back.
Well, you can sort of put it back.  But only by using your annual contribution limit of $5500.

This happened to me too. It ended up being that my webcam that I was using to verify my identity was to low resolution.  I went to Coinbase and was able to verify my identity there which extended to GDAX.  I forget what part of there website I used (settings or tools maybe), but I was able to upload a copy of my drivers license to verify my ID.  
The part about gdax I have a hard time with is how long it takes cash to clear before it can be used.  It takes about a week and in that time bitcoin may jump.

Totally thought for a second that the type was the private key.   Glad you didn't make the same mistake Bloomberg made a few days ago.

Anyone have a better link to the video? I'm on mobile and all the site does is replay the add over a and over.

This is not likely true.
What if the folks in the government saw the imense gains captured by these bitcoin early adopters.
What if they were very regretful that they did not get in while they had the chance.
What if they then realized that they could tank the market by making it significantly more difficult for the majority of bitcoin users to get their money in and out of bitcoin.
What if they are tanking the market so that the high government officials can time their buy ins and reap the rewards.
What if it is just a ploy to keep the money out of the hands of the peasants and where they feel it belongs.
And all because I never invented that fingwanger.
