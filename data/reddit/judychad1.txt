I always sell when I’m high, and always regret it when I come down.

Still think it was real?

Dude, nobody knows. Your guess is as good as anybody’s. Do a little looking at the charts, maybe read some predictions from coindesk and cointelegraph and make your best guess.

Dude, price is still way up from 60 days ago. Bury your head and chill. If you have more invested then you are comfortable losing pull some out, then chill and watch the money flow in or out (it shouldn’t bother you, if it does take some out).

All exchanges. You’ll just have to pay the taxes.

Don’t sell at a loss, it will come back!!

I think it is most likely option 1. They are growing super fast and still have a lot of kinks to work out. I’ve had a lot of good experiences with CB and a couple really bad ones. 
One bad one included sending 3 ETH from CB to Gdax and it never showing up. This was in December when they were way backed up so I just did my diligence, emailed, called, wrote a letter, filed a formal complaint with the government after a month. Then one day the ETH just showed up in CB again. CB supper continued to email me thinking the issue was still open until I told them otherwise.
I know it’s frustrating to not be able to invest that money, especial during the last dip, but we are still in the wild west and these things happen. If you are done with CB give Gemini a try and/or sign up for Robinhood.

Did they sell again today? Yikes!

I have not opened a Gemini account. Yes, I filled out the CFPB and it made me feel better but I actually got the Ether back a week after that and didn’t hear back from them for a couple weeks, so don’t think it had an effect on my case. It’s good piece of mind to cover all bases when this kind of money is involved.

First off change your bank and tell them why. Switch to a credit union, make sure to clear with them when you join that they allow ALL crypto purchases.
Second, what bank? Let us know so we can do the same if we bank there.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:55:57
I refuse to say anything more to them besides “just wait”

Jk, I’ll help. $50 profit.

I used my credit card to buy crypto and my pints to pay off my credit card, same thing I guess.

If they kill you they can’t get the coins. I’d call the bluff.

I can’t get into Coinbase or GDax right now, maybe maintenance?

Starting a mining project isn’t necessarily a get rich quick scheme, it often requires a large initial investment and a large increase in your monthly electrical bill.

It sucks for all of us, luckily I kept some scraps in my bank account so I can make it. Hope you did the same.
