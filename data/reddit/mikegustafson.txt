Alright ... so.    
A wallet is just whatever that string of characters is, and only works with specific keys (not 100% sure how but I accept it).    
Having the keys is what allows you to sign outgoing transactions. A trezor only signs with the keys, never shows them.    
Using  (or another one of their supported things) I can create a wallet (my random string that works with a key) and send the keys to my trezor (or it creates it, seems more likely) so that it can then be used to create whateveritis it uses to verify any transactions I do...    
That is actually pretty boss. Im only sad that the  is plastic while the  has a sick stainless steel one. And for $100 that sounds like the only way to deal with bitcoin.    
I store mine online, but whenever I get more then $10 I sell it (I have about 1th/s in mining); so if it got hacked it would suck but not end of the world sucked.    
Thank you.

Bad automation is a thing to worry about :S &lt;programmer&gt;

Yeah; that sucks

So don't buy one right now is what you're saying...

Could you go a little in depth with this.  So right now I either have an online wallet, or a desktop wallet, and my bits are saved there.  What would a node allow me to do in terms of being my own bank.
@_date: 2015-08-02 16:59:32
Thanks. I find this very interesting and will probably setup a full node (although I'll probably leave it at my mothers place. My miners alone raise the temp of my apartment).

Well. Based on what I commented on, and what I commented, I don't really understand your comment. Someone made a comment that it should have all these random things, I stated that I assumed what he was going for, based on the title of the post, was that it wasn't a good time to buy one.    
I didn't comment on the design.

How fast does that mine? I have an antminer U2 (usb miner) that does 2gh/s and I thought graphics cards weren't much faster. (I have 2 U2's, 1 S1 (180gh/s) and 2 S3's (480gh/s each) )

Thanks a bunch!

Welp, they are wanting to manipulate the votes.
@_date: 2015-07-29 02:10:28
looks like any of the commands I've used. If you can create a worker  and password for me (pm it to me) I'll try connecting with my usb miner that I use to test connections.
@_date: 2015-09-23 14:02:32
You're also looking at the older version of usb miners.  I have two U2 antminers that are rated at 2gh/s. They are used to test networks before I swap over my S1 (200gh/s) and S3's (450gh/s each).    
Right now if you were able to get an S3 with a power supply for $100 you'd probably make it back (power not included) in about 3 months. Depending on your electricity --&gt; about 5-6 months to break even. At this point all my miners have paid for themselves, except the USB ones. In their life time they might make me $5. Also, according to  the reward is going to halve in: Reward-Drop ETA: 2016-07-26 10:20:26 UTC (43 weeks, 6 days, 1 hour, 20 minutes). Meaning you'll get half of what you were able to mine before. At that point it'll almost break even for cost with electricity (if the price of btc stays), and then a few years later when it halves again, all your miners better be solar powered cause you'll be losing money on it to keep it on.

I think of it more like running miners. I have S3's, an S1 and two usb  U2's. They are entire computers (minus the usbs') dedicated to one bitcoin thing. If your running a full node, why is that computer doing anything else? I was under the assumption that people were using older computers they didn't really need anymore, slapping in a decent size hard drive, setting it up and letting it prrrrr.
@_date: 2015-09-04 14:25:21
You guys are so funny. I mean, what evidence do you have that he wont make his money back? I have 2 S3's that I got a few months ago that are at the break even point for me, minus electricity. I need another 3 weeks and then that should break even too. After that it's all in the green. Paid for them with the money my S1 made after it broke even 3-4 month after having it. A year later and it upgraded itself, as well as gave me random $20 here and there.      
I will say that sometimes it's smarter to mine a different coin then bitcoin for a day and make a random $30, but that means you have to stay on top of things.    
edit) My USB U2 miners may have made $5-10 in their lifetime costing $20 each. They are helpful for testing networks before going to them with other miners but very unlikly to get their return on investment.

My 2gh/s U2 antminer probably does not make me any money, but at 2W of power it isn't really costing me anything. My 200gh/s antminer costs me, apparently, 20 cents a day as of the current price. But that's also assuming a bunch of things. Using a multipool I usually at least break even. But don't get stuck with the other coins, unless you want to start trading, and then that's its own other monster. $/kWh here is 0.1 cents    I just used   to figure it out. It currently makes me 0.00212077 BTC / day (and that seems about right, every 8-9 days now I get a 0.02 payout)

I'd agree if except the miners I purchased with a guaranteed hash-rate at another place didn't crumble and leave me with nothing (I have 3 antminers in my apartment now). *grumble*    
Honestly this specific service/company might be freaking great. I loved the idea.

I'm a PHP developer - I use Wordpress a lot. Looks like you are using it too. Lots of little things to set up in the back end, such as your permalinks having that weird default system.    
Are you using wooCommerce? Works amazingly nice with the Stripe plugin ($80 for the stripe payment gateway). You can set it up so it pays you in just Bitcoin, just cash, or a split. I think it gets transferred a week after confirmation to your bank/wallet.    
If you are wanting to write your own, I would expect it to take some time, as well not be as secure. Also I wouldn't send money to a site that doesn't use a third party payment processor in fear that they will take it and run.

You are probably wanting a USB Antminer U2 - 2gh/s earning you maybe 1 cent a day. Power consumption is pretty small... Probably break even. Cost about $20 on ebay, that you'll never make back. I have two that I use to test pools before I move my antminer S1 over (200gh/s). It's not much but makes me $0.80 a day in profit (was about $2 a day when I got it. Full setup was $200 for my S1, paid for itself in 2-3 months and now it's just free bitcoins (yeah probably $15 a month in electricity). Also it helps if you mine coins that are new, just coming out, and then selling them off before it goes into the shitter. I think I mined $20 of payCoin in one day. Multi pools are pretty helpful too.
