Even with direct deposit you can get screwed.
If the 1st of the month (when I get my deposit) is a Sunday or other bank holiday, the government deposits it the day before putting it in a different month. I get charged for the current month because that month's deposit shows in the previous month. This happens several times a year. 
They know this is how it works have have set the system up to benefit themselves at the expense of people that can least afford it. Fuck banks.

When you have that little, savings are not an option. 
Besides, this isn't about how much money I have, it's about banks coming up with these little gems designed to get your money under the guise of a "free" product.

Only 3 million? Seems a tad low. I would have thought she had a bigger audience.

I've always said, if you have to call yourself "fair and balanced", there's a high chance that you're not.

Yes, but that's not was surprised me, it's that she only has "3 Million US Viewers". I figured she had more TV show fans than that.

Chances are they won't tell you. Same thing happened to me a few weeks ago. When I asked why they said they wouldn't reveal why. Withdrew all my shit and never looked back. I used to support Coinbase and often recommended it. Now, I recommend people get as far away from Coinbase as possible.

Coinbase is just like a bank and operates under the same regulations as a bank. If they didn't, the US would not let them operate on US soil they way they do.
PayPal on the other hand is *not* like a bank. They have not gone through the same rigorous regulations and paperwork that Coinbase has.
PayPal is *much* worse as the government has less control or regulation on what they can and can't do. PayPal can close your account and keep your money for any reason and there is very little you can do about it. Coinbase on the other hand has to answer to a few three letter agencies of the US government.

They *will not* tell you. Period. Same thing happened to me and they outright refused to tell me why. Got out and haven't looked back.
And no, I never did anything illegal. I had sold maybe $1000 in btc through them over the past few years. Fuck them.

Technically, your coin is stored in *their* wallet. I think what you mean is to not use them as a wallet which is very good advice.


Yes, they will hold your coins as long as you leave them there. Leave them there long enough without any account activity and they move the coins to an offline wallet meaning it can't be stolen if Coinbase got hacked.
Of course, along with the first part, you shouldn't leave your coins on Coinbase or *any* online site unless you are actively trading them. There is too much risk.
All said, I got out of Coinbase and advise everyone else to do so. After using them successfully for over two years they suddenly cut off my BTC-USD ability and refuse to tell me why. Fuck Coinbase.

You shouldn't be leaving it there in the first place. An exchange is NOT a bank and really isn't the safest place to keep your coin. You should only have what you are actively trading with on the exchange, everything else should be in your wallet or offline cold storage.

No. Any movement of coin is going to incur a transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-06-16 21:08:53
Yes, and I got a canned reply stating they would provide no further information or reason as to why.
Don't use them.

I'd used Coinbase a few times to cash out to my bank account over past few years. Went to go take advantage of this recent boon and they've decided to not allow me to do any USD transactions anymore and will not give a reason.
I used to recommend them to everyone, but after having my account essentially gimped, I'm warning people to get out now.
@_date: 2017-06-16 21:02:01
Correct. I could no longer convert to USD and withdraw to my bank. I had done this several times with no issues in the past. With this recent jump in BTC I decided to sell some, but no CoinBase wouldn't let me do SHIT. I can transfer BTC in and out no problem, I just can't do anything with it. Told them to fuck off and withdrew every last drop of coin I had. Fuck CoinBase.

After using them for BTC-USD and withdrawl to my bank for over two years, they have suddenly decided that I can no longer covert BTC to USD and withdraw it. They absolutely refuse to give any reason as to why.
Get out NOW. 
Fuck CoinBase.

They cooperate with the IRS just as any bank would. This is the only way they could legally operate. What makes you think it was ever otherwise?
@_date: 2017-06-16 21:23:21
A personal wallet on your PC. There is zero reason to use an online "wallet" and any online wallet that charges a fee is a fucking scam.
@_date: 2017-06-16 21:42:49
Ah, any crypto coin will have a "fee" associated with a transaction. That's what pays the miners to keep operating and keep the system in operation. Those fees are based on the coin, not on the exchange.
@_date: 2017-06-16 22:38:36
I don't have a clue. I basically got out of crypto on this bump and dumped the last little I had. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 02:21:06
Yes, all transactions incur a fee paid to miners for verifying transactions on the network.
