Make sure it's a well known wallet, make sure you're downloading from the correct URL, and verify the signature and checksum after you download it. If you're not 100% certain that you have a legit copy of the wallet executable then **do not type your seed words into it**!

What does this mean? Thank you.

I was trying to read up on this a while back and I was confused as I found conflicting information on what is valid for the redeemScript. On various wikis and articles, they said the same as you - that any script is valid. But reading [BIP-16]( I see this line:


which would suggest that the redeemScript must be a standard transaction type itself.
I haven't actually checked the code to see what rules the network is using, but I guess this specification in BIP-16 was not carried into the implementation? Is there anywhere I could have referred to which says exactly what the final version of the spec is that was accepted? Is the code the only source of truth for something like this?
I realize I also may have completely the wrong end of the stick.

One thing I'm trying to understand - routing other people's payments depletes the liquidity in your channel, so eventually you will need to open a new one. Do the fees that you collect make up for the cost of closing and opening a channel? Otherwise, what's the financial incentive to route other people's payments and deplete your own channel liquidity? Thanks.

Can you not set your own fee? At the time I'm writing this comment, ~15sat/B should be enough to get processed within the next few blocks (~1hr). For a normal size tx that would cost about $0.25.
If you can't set your own fee then see if you can get your private key out of that wallet and into a wallet such as Electrum that allows you full control over your transactions.

That was a good explanation, thanks.

Doesn't Shapeshift require KYC now?
