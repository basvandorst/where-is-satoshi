@_date: 2018-08-09 02:07:56
Thx.. I was bad in school ��
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:47:43
Not realy. Most of the gains came from reddit, shared by crypto community and then articles in international press... the average people from the streets sended just few penies.
@_date: 2018-08-09 14:18:17
Please PM me
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:49:04

Thanks ��
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:42:23

Not so hard, the stencil does all ����
@_date: 2019-06-05 06:29:03
Not yet, but it will surely happen in the future... to avoid this, people should verify first if the address is the good one on the website of the artist... and maybe someone should develop a dapp to authentify the official donations addresses from the artists. Dropping the idea here!
