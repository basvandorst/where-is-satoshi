Well, an hour ago we didn't have mass production and an economy based on people buying things they don't need.

This is what this subreddit seem to miss. If we removed inflation our economy would crumble within months. We need to radically alter the manner with which we spend our money before we remove inflation.

But that ability is essential for our current economy to function. Inflation is literally a requirement, although it should only hover around 2%. If you want to remove the necessity of inflation then we'd need radically change the worlds entire economic system, not just the currency we use. Consumerism would have to drastically reduce for instance. I'm not opposed to this, just pointing it out.

High taxes mean, among other things, better benefits which benefit mainly the poor. Lower taxes, among other things, mean lesser benefits which mainly affects the poor. Poverty is the main cause of crime. It's very simple.

Sure you might be but many aren't. What do we do about them? The cost of incarceration far outweighs the cost of benefits not to mention the cost of crime caused by poverty.

Yes and at what point did I say that that's not the case? 
Are you however saying that Trump hasn't increased taxes on the poor and given the rich massive tax breaks? Because THAT'S a flat out lie.
The more you make the more you pay and that's as it should be. Only it isn't, because at a certain threshold you reach a limit and as if that's not enough there are tons of ways for the rich to avoid paying taxes.

Well yes, but actually no, since the less you earn the less you pay. Unless you live in the US of course, because there they increase taxes on the poor and give millionaires the tax breaks. That's why you should tax the rich, and let the poor pay only so much that they can still live a decent life because it will be more economically sound for the vast majority of people.
Edit: This really is economy 101 for the majority of the western world.

I own btc, I like btc. But why would btc remove banks? We'd still need to loan btc just like we loan money, and we'd a central entity to loan from. Banks would still exist, only they'd trade in btc instead of money.
