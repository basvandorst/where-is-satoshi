Here is my theory, the comment about it's unrelated to the release of the news articles means just that, the tax cops were already planning this, but that seems to suggest Wright himself could have leaked this information now because he feared this was coming. Presuming that, it is still possibly real or a hoax. 
Maybe he has been pretending to be Satoshi for some time and convincing people he would eventually pay them back out of the fund, but never actually had access to it, and this is a last desperate attempt. If he his Satoshi, some weird shit is going down.
Either way, wow.

While I don't agree with OP explicitly, you have no idea WTF you are talking bout.

Would do way more than that. But this is an important thing to note in computer security/hacking in general. Physical threats are frequently more dangerous. Gaining physical access to a computer is much more powerful that over a network. Or if anyone cares to google it you can take the case of the sniper attacks on power stations, shoot a few transformers and you do more damage than hacking the SCADA for way less capitol investment.

I am asking you straight up right now because you have a history of trolling. Do you seriously not get what I just posted?
It has nothing to do with your personal relationship to This is not about which of you comes out looking better. It has nothing to do with your personal feelings. It is entirely about rhetoric, setting a precedent, and following the golden rule of treating others how you would like to be treated.
Most of these threads do not need to be arguments. This is not a zero sum game where the only way to win is to vilify another member of the community. The only thing getting into pissing contests and making accusations without solid proof does is discredit and drag down the entire community.
People were wrong to assume your original post had ulterior motives and start bashing you. Just as they are wrong in to assume the mods are making editorial decisions based on profit. 
This is not like Neo &amp; Bee, there isn't a long documented history of conflicting comments, there are not insiders blowing a whistle, nor is any of it an explicit scam or loss, but even there we have no excuse to run around calling people evil and inhuman. If there is then those things need to be put on the table for the entire community. The excuse that 'it is hard because mods delete' does not count. Evidence is still required on all sides, and even if it is found starting witch hunts will only push those involved to flee.
We need to practice deescalation. We need to give each other room enough to step back from positions that we learn are wrong. If we, as a community, vilify every mistake, then no one will be willing to admit theirs. This can only lead to positions where people are defrauded, however this is usually because people are afraid, not because they are greedy.
EDIT: Added some to the end to clarify my bigger point.

There is a good argument that the regulator bodies actually enabled 2008 and are creating similar circumstances again. IMHO, regulation is a tool, just like btc, that can be used and manipulated for good or ill. It is up to us as citizens and members of the market to push people in the right direction.

How does going after the people at Gox get you there though? There is little evidence to suggest that they are anything besides mildly incompetent and self serving.

Ah yeah, totally agree, figuring out how to deal with bad nodes is a good technical solution, but figuring out who to actually deal with the criminals themselves in a zero trust market is going to take it's own revolutionary jump.

I added this to my previous post because after submitting and rereading I thought I didn't clarify that well.


All my comments are made here in public and addressed to the community at large. You came here to engage me. I would be telling him the same thing. However, you cannot just shift the blame onto him. It does not make it any easy to come forward with your mistakes if you know you will be branded as a villain for them. It's not an excuse, it doesn't vindicate them, but we don't gain anything through revenge.
You are a victim and a subject of this mindset, it is doing arguably more damage to you than Theymos, so why continue to support it? You, individually, have more to gain from a community move towards reconciliation than most. If arguing and trolling hasn't worked for three years maybe it is time to try something else.
@_date: 2014-02-12 20:07:06
Great response. Just to add a little clarification for others, when people are explaining the Malleability problem they are explaining the results of a specific implementation of an attack. It is much harder to explain the relationship between the protocol and the implementations that allowed it to happen. Let alone how the attack as coded etc.

That is the one place where a human mod is the least effective. Vote bots are easier to deal with through algorithms than trusting a person to say, hmm this looks like it got too many votes.
Alternately keeping things on topic is poorly handled by automods. Keyword and title bans are clumsy and will always lead to accusations of censorship.

I'm willing to give bitstamp the bennifit of the doubt and believe they are actually getting DDOSed. I don't really have the chops to dig into the blockchain and see if it's happening myself, but I know others do and would expect to see someone calling bitstamp out if there is no evidence.

I appreciate it, but please don't. 
As you can see from my account I set up some other subs, and mod on but have not promoted them, because while I want to contribute to the values I believe reddit, at least can, represent, I know that I would end up making the very same mistakes as others. 
If I had gained more experience on small subs then maybe I would consider it, but going from 0 to arguably one of the most contentious and important subs (because so much of the community is here, as opposed to that's mostly laymen) would be too much.
Beyond that, no offense, but an endorsement from you would probably ensure the death of any moderation campaign at this point in time.
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:25:19
I'm looking forward to the analysis of the attack. Hopefully we will at least be able to find out if it was undertaken by competitors or outside forces.

I feel bad for you (not in a condescending way). So many people with next to nothing at stake are here for the popcorn and willing to troll to fuel the fire.
To everyone else. There is a real discussion that needs to be had here about transparency, conflicts of interest, and moderation accountability, but it cannot happen while people are blindly downvoting anything that isn't "lol it's all corrupt" circlejerk. 
Remember that the mods are people too, and recognize you probably know very little about what it is actually like trying to moderate a community like this. Unless you actually have proof manipulation and/or illicit gains stop crying wolf. It will only help scammers hide in the shuffle.
If the idea is that we just cannot trust a centralized moderation team and a mutable forum, then build something better, don't make it harder to work with what we have.
@_date: 2014-04-21 07:16:57

Besides Paul and Amash I wouldn't classify any of them as part of the cohorts I signled out. Googling their names with intellectual property doesn't bring up anything of note, Paul's brings mostly people asking what his stance is. 
I don't know much about Tom Woods other than google and wikipedia telling me that he makes his money selling educational information. Arguably relying intellectual property for his living. 
Molyneux (who frequently identifies as an anarchist and volunteerism over libertarianism), Rockwell, and Kinsella are all great, but they are not that closely associated with most of what is labeled as libertarianism these days. Nor are they representatives, and as far as I know none intend to run for office, which is what I was referring to.
Don't get me wrong I'd love to see it become a rallying point for the libertarian party, but I just don't see it. I think most of the people who are attracting a following of young people are not explicitly partied up and a frankly more pundits and wonks that organizers and leaders.
EDIT: I'd also like to point out that people like [Bernie Sanders \(a self proclaimed socialist\) and Joseph Stiglitz]( are opposing the current IP regime. The IP debate seems to have no solid party lines. I will support anyone regardless of party affiliation who is trying to make sensible reforms.

I am aware of accusations on all sides and by no means am I saying that Theymos is not above reproach. However, many things you have said in related threads (not all but many) are very much argumentative and antagonistic. The original post, while I believe it was an attempt at being humble, came off as self congradulating for learning a lesson that many problem feel like was self evident, it was in no way pleading. I can't comment as to other specifics, but I suspect only very few actually can.
I am saying that this is much bigger than individual conflicts and that we can all gain from stepping back the intensity of the rhetoric. What do you have to lose if that happens? The best case scenario, regardless of whether you like it or not, is that you are just as wrong about Theymos being a scammer as you believe others are about you. Worst case, helping to accomplish a real dialog that isn't filled with voting brigades and flames leads to exposing real corruption here that cannot be written off because of the context of the thread. 


I have no idea of how any of this relates to entrapment. It's the kind of stretch that damages your credibility. Please believe me when I say that I'm not pointing this out to try and be right or get more karma, but because I genuinely want to help you make your case better. Not because I have a stake in you vindicating yourself, but because I have stake in this community succeeding and having open dialog is essential to that.

I think your right about DPR not being a single person.

Thanks for the tip! 
I meant that in a less technical way though. As in where is the attack coming from? What seems to be the most likely motive for this specific attack? Are the bad nodes all working in the same way that suggests the attack is a single implementation? Or is it irregular enough to suggest an uncoordinated attack?
Not to bombard you personally with questions. That's just where my mind goes to. I'm inclined to believe it will get fixed so I'm more interested in why the attack is happening now.

What I am trying to say is that we cannot just automate our problems away. A lot of the technical solutions to distributed computing, while they sound like they apply to their social network counterparts, are not one for one matches. Beyond that there is no such thing as a perfectly secure, unexploitable system. Even if there was it would still externalize, still have side effects, still create specific incentives. If we are only looking at technical solutions the those externalized costs will largely be a social burden.

Seems like a lot of communities are going trust broke/bankrupt[?] and people are unable to communicate in ~~goof~~ good faith. 
Not just Reddit, or even the internet, it's basically the problem in Ukraine, a ton of people all saying they want basically the same things, but are unable to trust the one another. People get paranoid, take a stance in the heat of the moment, and wont back down because they are afraid it will be used against them if they do.
Even if the BTC protocol is trust-free it does not mean we can operate as a community without any kind of trust. It makes even having simple conversations difficult, let alone combining resources to accomplish our actual goals.

The point is that regardless of what you name something, some group will have a negative reaction. Beyond that, changing the name now would frankly make it seem like they are trying to hide to a lot of people. It's just not worth it to bicker over branding.

You saying that gives everyone else an excuse to say, I don't take your apology/post seriously because of my emotions regarding you.

Regardless of how it is done the rules have to be unambiguous. 
I am personally partial to a [good faith]( rule in most cases, but it is somewhat antithetical to a zero-trust network. Assuming bad faith seems to be the cause of a lot of problems here, but I wonder if there is a middle path, a no faith rule. 
Any which way you end up moderating rhetoric. The difference is usually the difference between asking someone if they meant X or assuming they meant X. People get pissed when others presume to know their internal motivations, specially when they are wrong. I just don't know if there is a way to properly incentivize simple politeness like not expressing opinion as fact, not assuming bad faith, etc.
Dealing with the Eternal September, Sybils, and all of the other things that come with networked/distributed communities is a not trivial problem we are only beginning to understand. Some of the solutions are going to be protocol level guarantees and accountability, a lot are going to need to be social convention and education about how these communities actually work.

It is hard to work on something that you have packaged up already. Since doing the work relies on testing it on the network they have to be able to push updates out really fast from a development environment. Spending the time to make executables, sign them, etc for ever fix you push is a pain.

I disagree with that. I fully believe that you had the best intentions and have stated them honestly. However, the conversation (regardless of topicality) did not prevent other discussions from happening in subthreads. The mass downvotes are certainly an over reaction, as are many of the unfounded accusations, but the response was predictable, and the burden of proof and accountability (fair or not) is on the moderation team.
Maybe a Bitcoin forum should be totally anonymous, but Reddit is not and it would create a huge overhead for participating in the community, unless you could streamline the process, and ensure you are not leaking information. Something I don't think can be done through AutoModerator. Honestly any real solution would require implementing new features into reddit's core code. Bot's and what can be done with CSS are effectively just cosmetic.
IMHO, this is an issue that cannot be solved with just technical fixes. As much as many of us like to think we can code away the problems with human nature it just isn't possible. We just end up papering over the human element and not doing anything to improve it.

I'd be more than happy to help organize a research group on how to best handle many of the common problems of online communities. I have spent a lot of my free time learning about sociology, complexity, game theory and more hoping to better understand the communities where I communicate (from IRC, to 4chan and slashdot, to reddit) and have seen my fair share of flame wars and drama. 
I really have no interest in becoming a mod though. I suspect I don't know enough of the internal politics and major players to be an effective mod. Beyond that I can do more as a third party than a vested interest. If I have nothing to gain from promoting civility and effective community moderation mechanisms they are more likely to not be undermined by accusations of corruption.

Your totally right, but it goes both ways, it is equally as valid to attempt to turn those terms against them and remove the negative connotations. The people who want to push the edges of the community to conform mainstream branding are equally, if not more, conforming to societal standards.

In the case of the Fed it is a private institution which is not controlled by the government really.
Regardless of the specific goals and 'opponents' that Satoshi had in mind it seems clear it was in response to the Financial Crisis that bitcoin was made public.

It's a possibility for sure, but it could just as easily be nongovernmental. Altcoins, exchanges that think they have the problem fixed, corporate interests, someone who thinks it is the best way to force a change, someone who thinks the can exploit it for profit. It seems more likely that there are multiple motives, but it would be interesting if the attack turns out to be mostly uniform in implementation. Could be almost impossible to figure it out. All I know is that I know enough to be suspicious but ~~know~~ *not* enough to figure it out myself.

I'm not saying it is clear cut, but having an 'majority' vote is not the same thing as total centralization. The real issue is that this is all a brand new frontier, and ETH probably lacked a robust set of self governing features it needed to address these kinds of issues. 
This might kill ETH, but the important take away is that there will be loopholes, whether or not they count as explicit computer intrusion or malicious code installation, or whatever current crime, and the community on that blockchain will need a mechanism to deal with the unexpected and seemingly out of system parameters events. 
We need a way to respond to breaches of the social contract in the blockchain, hell the social contract itself needs to be explict and in there, and self modifying, if things like ETH are going to live up to their promises.

So what law exactly? In what country? How many jurisdictions do the people invested in theDAO live? How about all the computers where the code ran? What contractual agreements are there, and what parts of them are legal in which jursidictions?
This would be a nightmare to prosecute. I totally think this is a breach of the social contract, but this community can't seem to agree exactly what happened, let a lone a court. 
This is not a clear cut case of computer intrusion. Some exploits are legal according to the systems they exploit. There is no way out of that because no system can completely describe itself. Incompleteness is a real bitch, not just a philosophical idea.

That is all hacking is, finding bugs. 
Some people find some bugs in some systems socially acceptable, others they don't, some of us see those bugs as features. 
It doesn't mater if it's in low level systems code, the platform, the people, or the law, a hack exploits any loophole or bug it can.
The question isn't weather it was a hack or not, the question is how do we respond when an individual exploits any system for their personal benefit?

... really don't get what you are trying to say here. I am not conflating any of those things. My assertion was that criticism is not a method for gaining understanding. To expand a little I would say its proper place comes after a relatively deep level of understanding has been achieved.
I have said nothing about disagreement or hate. I am even more confused as to "conscious empathy != binary." For one that is structurally unsound. != is generally only used if something at least could be equal. I think you mean to say that empathy isn't binary, but I don't know what you mean by that, nor do I know why you think I am making such an assertion.

I just did. It does seem to be relatively harmless, but I watched SRD go from somewhere funny and light heartted to having some pretty dysfunctional people throwing fuel on fires for the fuck of it.
I appreciate the conversation and thank you for your time.
@_date: 2015-04-17 10:37:52
I appreciate you being candid. And frankly from your comment you seem to be the positive side of 'meta subs,' but there are all too many people willing to instigate drama to feed places like that. I agree that hate is probably not the right word, but frankly because for many once someone is designated as an outsider (explicitly or not) they are not worth hating. There are also those exceptional individuals who in spite of not being hateful, just love to watch other peoples drama, to watch the world burn, or are just curious and what to see what will happen if they push people.
IMHO if you really want to understand a community you will participate in that community without, (I'm trying to think of a way to say this diplomatically), a crutch, or external community dedicated to being outside of those you are 'curious' about. I honestly think it is usually a sign of a very unhealthy kind of interaction and is additionally not great for the community. Warranted or not seeing a group of people, who are not you, get together to talk about you can cause some paranoia. More reasonably it is seen as being a holy than thou attitude and many people find the idea of "oh lets watch these strange people" condescending at best. Directed at communities admittedly much more marginalized than this it is seen as exotification, tokenism, and/or benevolent prejudice at best and perhaps too easily attributed to malicious bigotry. However, there truly is a thin line between the aforementioned. 
I appreciate your curiosity, but I ask you to satisfy it by placing yourself in the place of those you are curious of, and ask yourself how does it feel to be observed as a mere curiosity?
@_date: 2015-04-17 10:48:27
The point is that it describes, people, all people. Not individual communities. You are not immune to the effects of memetics, nor am I.
@_date: 2015-04-17 10:44:42
I agree with you completely. I'd also argue that such actions only serves to further marginalize and isolate a community. It also frequently gives credence to an oppositions claims of intolerance, nepotism, etc, perhaps convincing those that are unsure that the worst is indeed true. 
There is of course the venerable Streisand Effect as well as the less well known Eristic Principle. Or one might point out that even if you are not feeding the trolls directly, seeking to actively remove them is still taking the bait. One should not take bait lightly, for the risk of over reaction is more than real.
@_date: 2015-04-17 11:45:47
Okay so this is the thing, I totally believe you that you honestly feel/respond that way. But I am not asking about *you* I am asking you to put how you feel and think aside and perceive it as another would.
You seem like the kind of person who is very self assured and confident in the person that you are. Not a bad thing at all, but it can mean running roughshod over others without noticing. I say this as someone who had to make a conscious effort to learn to be empathetic. I appreciate that you are trying, I wouldn't be taking the time to this conversation if I didn't, but expressing your views (no matter the intention) has nothing to do with empathy.
@_date: 2015-04-17 11:21:46
I actually responded to and agreed with you on that comment. I think you are totally right about that.
But think about what you have just written here. How much of it actually has something to do with what I said (I never once talked about criticism to get you started)? How much of what you just wrote is a defense of a community that you are a part of?
Read "If you identify so closely with the community that you cannot help but to take it personally when the community is looked at critically, I would say that is probably not a healthy level of detachment." That could be my response to you right now.
I am asking you to make a conscious effort of empathy, of understanding (something you yourself have claimed to desire), but your response has simple been more criticism. In my experience there is a significant difference between criticism and understanding. By your word you want to understand, but by your actions (admittedly also your words) your comments are more about presenting your opinion and criticism of this community.
Form a quick look I see you post to pcgaming. So I will try and use that to express my previous point. How would you feel if there was a sub called pcgayming and people who regularly post in that sub regularly came to pcgaming and said pcgaming is an unhealthy community. That pcgamers were curious people hard to understand, but that watching their drama was good popcorn (to steal a phrase form SRD)?
If you cannot do so, and show some self awareness and reflection than the only thing I can conclude is that you are indeed more interested in telling people that your opinion of a community you are admittedly at least distanced from what you think of them.
@_date: 2015-04-17 12:12:27
Frankly I am usually the one telling people they need to get a thicker skin. 
I think strawmen are strawmen and I frankly don't have strong feelings about this at all. I, like yourself, am primarily curious, (I also didn't even know buttcoin was a thing until today) it is just my experience that the meta-sub phenonmenon gets in the way of actually understanding a community. It acts as a psychological barrier between you and the people that you are, in ungenerous words, studying, and contributes to the kind of thing happening in this thread.
As far as answering my questions goes, I think you are maybe being a little too correct and I am not sure what assumptions you are referring to. This isn't a right or wrong answer kind of thing, its an exploring different states of mind kind of thing.
@_date: 2015-04-17 15:40:04
Not sure I see your point. 


if it is then I was totally unaware. This whole thread seems to be about peoples emotions. Can you point to where this was stated otherwise?
Beyond that, people just have them like it or not, I am asking another, in a totally rational way, to analyze why another might be having a specific emotional response. Not adding in more emotions...
As a side note, this seems to be a pretty odd point to jump into a discussion. I am curious as to why you decided to.

Most conspiracies are started because the conspirators feel they are being conspired against (rightly or wrongly). It is a serious problem in game theory, there are pretty good solutions for most situations, but once you get to the stage where good faith is lost you are almost always going to get suboptimal results and have an incredibly hard time getting out of that hole.

I only understand enough of this to ask questions, but what is to stop the community from having a diverse set of specialized nodes that one could opt in to running? I'm thinking not just about the current state of bitcoin but its future where more projects like namecoin pop up looking to use more cycles on the bitcoin network. Would there be a way to efficiently distribute different tasks to nodes who were most suited to accomplish them?
@_date: 2011-08-09 07:50:51
I can't say that I am sure this is right, but I get the same impression. As long as the community remains vigilant and there are good ways to form pools, (or co-ops, or affinity groups whatever way miners decide to organize themselves) then it is not really the same concern. The ability to scale does concern how many projects like namecoin can fit tho. I think bitcoin is brilliant, but it does not answer every problem and where it fails other solutions will have to be built. But supernodes probably are not going to be the biggest issue. Understanding the economics of the network as it gets more complex is going to be the real challenge.

From a psychological perspective it's just not the same to attack a pseudonym. We don't connect to a name the same way we do to a face, to knowing where someone lives, what they do in their spare time. They can attack Satoshi as the original developer of bitcoin, but there is nothing else there to attack, no known personal traits, etc. Sure they could make something up, but that is not nearly as effective as going after something real about a person, whether or not you or I think it's shameful/wrong.

The blockchain is public, so we actually do have ways to say that. It's also a counter to the idea that its a perfect money laundering solution, and a counter to the theft argument, a bunch of people have lost stuff to hacks, but almost none of that coin has been spent.

Much agreed. Over the last year speculative investment has turned btc into some kind of bastard stock. IMHO people just buying coin and not using it (ie not even running a real wallet) are the equivalent of leeches. Not saying we should burn them with fire or anything, a healthy ecosystem needs bottom feeders etc, but those innovating on the platform and using it in novel ways are those who should be held up as leaders in the community. 
I don't know where btc, and cryptocurrencies in general, will be a year from now, but I am a fan of anything that helps promote a better understanding than "digital gold."
@_date: 2013-12-30 10:54:22
I'm not inferring anything, I am saying exactly what I mean to, any technology that significantly impacts socio-econimcs tends to change the definitions of related terminology. I am not saying that bitcoin needs to change the definition of fiat money, just that might be a side effect.
And actually, yes, yes you can. That is the whole point of a dictionary having multiple entries, things have multiple definitions. I am not saying that bitcoin should be referred to as a fiat currency. I am saying what I said and nothing more, for the definition of fiat as not having intrinsic value OP's statement was perfectly correct.

I think what OP means is that it is not backed by anything like a fiat currency.
Additionally it kind of is distributed fiat, it is still issued by decree, it just happens to be the decree of the network, not the decree of a nation state or monarch.

I think cryptocurrency is a nicely descriptive term that is already being used, but I actually like cryptoledger better. It emphasizes that the actual software is a system for accounting, not just a mint and a product.
@_date: 2013-12-30 11:32:02
No its not. Bitcoin is an account in a ledger, known as the blockchain, distributed across the computers running the program while being secured and guaranteed accurate by a cryptographic algorithm. 
A bitcoin is one unit of value in that accounting system. The five W's of that value all depend on how it is being used at any point in time.

Can't say that I am playing stupid, but you sure do still seem to care since you are responding. But seriously, I'm not trolling you or playing stupid and can't see why you think so. It is pretty obvious I didn't even imply most of the shit you said, but judging by most your comments you are a rational intelligent person. I can't see why a little thing like differing definitions has got your panties in such a bunch.
@_date: 2013-12-30 09:53:32
I just hope that more people begin to realize that cryptocurrencies are not monolithic. The real power of bitcoin is the distributed proof of work algorithm. The technology can easily be used to innovate in all kinds of accounting. 
I think the most important thing it might do is make people realize that money is just that, a made up system for accounting. Too often our economic system is presented a solid physics when it is anything but. Bitcoin has so many different hooks, I just hope the line leads to the same place.
@_date: 2013-06-16 04:08:12
Not really. Think about who we are talking about here, someone/s who solved a major computational problem that many people had been working on for years. So far we know they are snooping on major cloud providers, splitting fiber at major network choke points, and possible serving NSLs to SSL  providers. All you'd really have to do is not use cloud services, self sign your SSL, host outside the US on fairly secure servers. VPN to a tor node, etc, there is a lot of stuff that someone just willing to learn and be careful can do. That's not even talking about someone who is truly gift.

However, give people some slack, by some definitions just the algorithms involved were revolutionary advancements in computer science. People can have all sorts of different definitions in normal conversation, when it is something as new and nebulous as cryptocurrency that gets even harder.

Unfortunately nothing. Most definitions put fiat money as state declared legal tender etc etc first, but usually one line item is just "money with out intrinsic value" which is perfectly accurate in this context.
Plus btc's goal is to change economics, I would say its not doing that very well if we don't start to see the semantics change.

[bitcoinity]( is a good place for market data. Something you will need if you want to make money trading. The exchanges are not yet built up to the same level of trading you might see in established markets (wall street etc), but there are some places that are starting to offer features like that.
[Coinsetter]( is coming from Wall Street and going into open beta soon. [Bitfinex]( offers some similar features now, but are incorporated out of Hong Kong.
If you are going to be doing it seriously then you will want to invest in security, what that means is up to you, but can include a dedicated computer, offline wallets, etc.
Also if you are looking for information on how to read market charts and about trading in general I think Kahn Academy has some videos on the subject still.

Don't treat Tor like a solution, it is not. BATMAN, i2p, freenet, hypeboria/cjdns/project-meshnet, netsukuk, are all alternatives that have slightly different goals and methods. Tor is only mildly good at keeping the origin of your traffic hidden.

I love how people make shit up when they want to be right. I never said it was any ones duty, only a logical side effect of massive change. Beyond that your analogy is terrible. And if you weren't lazy you could look it up on wikipedia and any other dictionary and see that I am actually correct. One of the definitions of fiat is without intrinsic value.
I'm so tired of this useless pedantic bullshit that people use to stifle discussions they disagree with. You don't like the definition fine, but that doesn't mean you get to make up bs and read whatever you want into peoples comments so you can stoke up your e-penis.

From a formal Ethics perspective you just hit on one of the really Big Questions. My personal conclusions is that it is usually ethically wrong, but can be the morally correct decision.
