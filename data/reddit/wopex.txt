I'd be willing to translate into German!

Thanks for your input!
I was thinking along the same lines as you but wanted to find out if there was an interest nonetheless. 
That tuna can idea is great :D who would look for information on an empty tuna can?! (well up until now)

Kraken has a good UI and nice features like stop loss but they went offline yesterday for &gt;6h and for the first 2 hours there was no word as to why and when they were planning on restoring services. Then they tweeted:


and we had to wait another 4 hours before services (Website) came back. The thing that made me a bit angry was that the API access was still active meaning people who had written bots could still perform trades leaving the normal users standing there watching trades go through without being able to log in (luckily the price didn't move much during that time).
The kraken team have now stated that they were under a DDoS attack during the time they were offline.

I'm sorry I don't have a solution to your problem but I have some advice once you get the codes back.
The app Authy is a very good alternative to Google Authenticator as it has the option to backup your codes to their server and you can recover them in the case something happens to your iPhone (Yes, encrypted!).
Good Luck!

Your first priority should be to secure them **as fast as possible** and **don't** connect your Laptop to the internet as the OS is probably outdated and very vulnerable to malware. If you then want to spend some install a wallet onto your Laptop and learn how to do an offline transaction with electrum for example.
Offline transaction for electrum:
About your question concerning the best services: 
There are a number of sites dedicated to trading website where you can trade your BTC into various fiat currencies or altcoins. If you are not an experienced trader I would advise you to stay away from trading.

Yes it will take a long time for you to download the whole blockchain. I would also advise you to get an lightweight and easy to understand wallet like electrum or multibit, armory is aimed at the more advanced and feature hungry bitcoiner.
Not trying to bash anyone but windows is widely known as an OS that attracts more malware than other OS'es. Why not get an USB bootable Linux and boot from there (It also leaves the possibility open to encrypt your whole OS)?

Nothing involving heat signatures, I'm sorry!
But something that would withstand a very hot house fire and some harsh physical environments.

I wouldn't risk it. Why don't you use Bitstamp If you're in the EU? They only have a 0,90€ fee for withdrawal and you would even have a small arbitrage.

Please do some more research on Bitcoin! All transactions are final.

Try resubmitting the images of your ID and Tax Return. It should say "PENDING" when a verification request has been made.
