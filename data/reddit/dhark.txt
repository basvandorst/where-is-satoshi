I'm not saying there wouldn't be enough bitcoins to go around, I'm saying that the motivations to hold and to spend impact each other. If most holders believe the price will continue to rise at faster than real interest rates in fiat currencies, that makes BTC more attractive as a store of value (for obvious reasons), and less attractive as a currency - pricing goods is a challenge, and more importantly once you have BTC there's a temptation to sit on them and get rich, among other reasons. 
If most people believe BTC prices have stabilized, then there's an incentive to use them as currency - no point sitting on bitcoins anymore if that won't get you rich. That's the scenario where 10% of e-commerce becomes conceivable - but it also brings the coins out of cold storage, leading to short-term inflation, and pushing up velocity.
I'm having trouble conceiving an equilibrium where 90% of coins are sitting idle, while the rest of the world is happily doing its e-commerce with BTC. What deflation rate would allow that?

I think you're leaving out velocity. Even if $125B in bitcoin gets spent each year, you have to factor in how many times per year each bitcoin gets spent, on average. It's silly to assume that every merchant who receives a bitcoin will just sit on it for the rest of the year. Velocity of M1 has been in the 7-10 range for a long time, but I doubt that's a reasonable predictor of something as different as bitcoins.
Of course if it's primarily used as a store of value, velocity could be very low ... but that means capturing 10% of e-commerce is unrealistic.
