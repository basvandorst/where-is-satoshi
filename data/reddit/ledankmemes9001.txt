Thanks for the link, this place has become just as toxic as @_date: 2017-09-29 14:22:40
By opening the app, I meant using the generated codes to disable Authenticator so it can be re-enabled somewhere else. If you have the password to the phone it’s easier to do this instead.
EDIT: After looking more into it, Authenticator does seem to only use that private key you referred to, and not any kind of hardware verification. In that case it looks possible to move it from one rooted phone to another.

I think it’s more than just a digital key, I believe it use unique IDs in the phone’s hardware too. 
Even if your right, you need the phone’s password to root, and if you have the phone’s password, you could just open the app anyway.

If he is referring to google Authenticator this will not help, and will make the situation worse.
What type of two step verification are you using?
@_date: 2017-09-29 05:30:12
Yeah he can just disable it and re-enable it.
Using text message as 2 step verification is easier when switching phones, but it’s less secure. Apparently hackers can spoof text messages now, so if they have your password and phone number, you’re done. 
Google Authenticator is tied to your phone. It’s inconvenient if you change or lose your phone, but it cannot be spoofed (that I know of at least).

Google Authenticator cannot be backed up via iTunes, iCloud, or any other backup method. 
You must log into coinbase via their website and disable google Authenticator, then re-enable it using your new phone. When you link your new phone, coinbase will give you a backup key in case your phone gets lost or broken. Physically Write that down and keep it somewhere safe.
If you listened to this guy and you did not write down the backup key you would have locked yourself out of your coinbase account, and you would have to go through coinbase’s customer service to unlock it.
Always write down google Authenticator backup key, and always know that Authenticator is tied to your phone and cannot be moved to a new one!!!!!!!!

Yeah that’s right, just remember to write down the backup code while doing step 4. 
Concerning your old phone. Once you disable Authenticator in your step 1, the old codes on your old phone are useless, so you might as well delete them, but not a big deal if you don’t.
