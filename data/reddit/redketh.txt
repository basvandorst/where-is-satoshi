Good point, but I don't think that a radically new Commerce Clause interpretation is coming soon to save marijuana. Plus, the federal government can always fall back to their power to make and enforce treaties--marijuana is covered by one.

That's not how it works. When there's a conflict between federal and state law, a constitutional federal law displaces state law entirely. The state can use the federal law to prosecute, the feds can use the federal law to prosecute, and both state and federal courts are bound to follow the federal law.

It's not any more legal in Colorado than it is in Texas. Just because a state ignores federal law doesn't make it go away.

We don't have two law systems. When there's a conflict, federal law supersedes. Marijuana is still illegal.

How would this be different from the current system? And why would Debtcoins be valuable to anybody?

Thank you for the information and for correcting my earlier mistake. I feel a lot more comfortable about Bitcoin now!

This needs discussed more. It Bitcoin is going to thrive, it *must* develop a robust layer of abstraction. Something like Visa or MasterCard for Bitcoin--the merchant swipes the card and the online wallet places a hold on funds. Sure, this would create some dreaded centralization, but it would still be possible to transfer money directly. It would also make Bitcoin a lot more "non-geek" friendly. No more software, QR codes, verification delays, etc. Just an account that works just like any other online banking service.

Why can't a third party holder be used instead?
@_date: 2013-04-25 08:49:22
Perhaps I'm just confused then. I thought that the network didn't iron out double spending until the generation of a block. So if you sent the coin to yourself first, then the merchant, the merchant's transaction wouldn't make it into the block chain. Where does the network check for double spends before the generation of a block?
@_date: 2013-07-02 00:49:01
That might protect me from some forms of outright fraud--shipping an empty box, etc.--but chargebacks can be used for much more than that. I can use them if the product is of poorer quality than expected, of if it's broken, or if the merchant doesn't respect their return policy. I've had these problems with respected merchants (NewEgg being one), and a chargeback was the only way to get my money back.

No offense, but VPS providers are notorious for failing. What happens to my hardware fee if you go out of business?

The Gonzales decision doesn't allow the federal government to do anything, see [United States v. Lopez]( It's actually from a longer line of cases that began in 1942 with [Wickard v. Filburn](
@_date: 2013-04-08 07:06:33
I'm confused. Can somebody more experienced than me explain why arbitrary data is allowed in the blockchain? Shouldn't the network just reject data that isn't required to verify transactions or that doesn't hash/encrypt correctly?
@_date: 2013-07-02 00:51:44
Yes, I am. I'm not afraid that Home Depot will abscond, but it's a very real possibility that they'll refuse to adhere to their return policy, or to return a defective item. It's happened to me before, even from respected merchants.
@_date: 2013-07-02 00:53:06
If you seriously believe that you were a victim of chargeback fraud, you can always sue the buyer in a court of law. Sound to difficult? Well, that's the only recourse that Bitcoin gives buyers...

Read up on [United States Code, Title 18, Section 1956]( Money laundering laws apply to all "financial transactions," which the law defines to include:

Not entirely accurate. Double spending attacks become exponentially harder with each successive block, starting from the block that the transaction is in. However, an attacker can trivially spend the same coin twice simply by making two transactions during the time between the last block being generated and the transactions being placed in a new block (around 10 minutes).
In this case, it would be simple to, say, send some Bitcoins to another address of yours with your phone and then immediately pay with the same coins for the taxi ride.

The Court in Missouri v. Holland held that Congress has the power to enforce treaties, even if the federal government wouldn't normally have the power to pass laws on the subject.
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:07:46
Uh, yes. Why would I want to hold on to something that I can't spend without fearing prosecution?

Federal law is local law, per the above provision in the United States Constitution.
@_date: 2013-07-02 01:55:04
Yes, I could use the court system to resolve a $40 scam. Heck, I'm even a lawyer and could represent myself. It's still not worth the filing fees, lost time, and collection process. Under the chargeback system, I just call my bank and have the money back in my account the same day.
What's wrong with the *seller* using the court system to collect against buyers who use fraudulent chargebacks?

Why do we even have a messaging feature? Especially considering that we're starting to get worried about bandwidth issues and hitting block size limits.
@_date: 2013-07-02 00:42:37
I refuse to use Bitcoin for most Internet purchases precisely because I'm afraid of scams. As a buyer, it's a no-brainier. I can use my credit card, where I can almost always get my money back if I'm scammed by a seller; or I can use Bitcoin, where my only recourse is suing somebody.
@_date: 2013-04-08 11:10:07
I see. I also just learned about scripts, which also allow arbitrary data to be injected into the blockchain. I would have just said that scripts should be eliminated, but your public key example is a good point. I can't think of any reasonable way to distinguish a legitimate public key from encoded data.
Thanks for helping me understand!
@_date: 2013-07-02 00:46:29
I fail to see how this is preferable. A fraud prevention system should always benefit buyers first, considering that it's their money at risk. The current credit card system is perfect in that the buyer has a good chance at winning chargebacks, but the seller can present enough evidence to defeat a claim--each side has some protection. With Bitcoin, buyers get zero protection and sellers get absolute protection.
@_date: 2013-05-13 06:00:23
There's not much legitimate about violating federal and international law. Crap like this only hurts the legitimacy of Bitcoin.

You do know what "[notwithstanding]( means, right? You can rephrase the above as:


@_date: 2013-05-13 16:07:30
Congress can use the Commerce Clause, which the Supreme Court said was valid in [Gonzales v. Raich]( to ban marijuana. Even if, for some reason, the Court changed their mind, marijuana is still banned by the international [UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]( treaty. As the Supreme Court held in [Missouri v. Holland]( Congress has the power (and responsibility) to enforce international treaties, even if doing so exceeds their normal power.
To quote from the Wikipedia article on Missouri v. Holland:

Are BitStamp coupons no longer offered as a transfer option?
@_date: 2013-05-13 09:10:24
Here's a theoretical attack. Your Bitcoin client loads the private keys into memory, and some executable code executed while the client is open (from whatever source, Flash, Java, etc.) exploits a security hole to scan the computer's memory for the private keys. It then sends the keys back to the attacker and terminates itself. It may even be possible to access the private keys in memory after the client is closed, although that would be a pretty big oversight on behalf of the client authors.
An attack like this seems pretty advanced, but I guess it could have happened to you.
