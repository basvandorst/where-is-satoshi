Criminals on a large enough scale have historically used banks to launder money.

How is it not a common solution?  It's gaining worldwide adoption, more every day, and reality doesn't really care what your biases are.  Market cap tells the story.


Nice opinion you have there.

I've been saying this for a while... if you look at fiat currency for what it is (a government debt note; a bet on the issuing entities' continued willingness and ability to pay its obligations), then it's entirely plausible to me that geopolitical, economic and military instability (or really anything that makes people think governments are less reliable) would drive down the value of fiat relative to crypto.  People and entities might then flee to it as a store of value that does not rely on the solvency or trust of any particular individual or entity.
Look at Venezuela, Zimbabwe or Weimar Germany before WW2 to see what runaway fiat inflation does to people (hint: they end up hungry).  Governments can always print more money.  Bitcoins, on the other hand can only be mined at a given rate, and will eventually become deflationary (there will be less available, rather than more).
Edit: I accidentally a word.

Having worked at one of the banks during college and shortly after graduating, a couple of years before they went under, I'd say the people who work at them know better than anyone not to trust them - after all, they see the toxic corruption and deceit from the inside.

Well, they'll certainly learn a valuable lesson about investing.

That reality doesn't make it any less likely to happen.
