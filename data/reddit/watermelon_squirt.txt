Exactly, the only real value of money are the things it pays for.
What I meant was that if no one cared about money, and we took money away from the world, nothing would change. People would still show up to work. They would still continue their education. They would still go out and get things at the store. Theoretically, they would only take what they needed. 
Maybe I'm wrong, and perhaps it has become a tangible thing. We've transformed our desires into a green dyed cotton strip. Now it's become digitized.

Websites are trying to scam you for your BTC.
Why, if BTC was a scam, would anyone want to steal them from you?
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:37:47
Say you always buy BTC on a gut feeling instead of regular intervals. Your gut feeling may be wrong more than half the time, leading you to lose more money in the long run. If you buy in regular intervals, you average your losses with your gains, and you end up gaining more. 
It's called dollar cost averaging. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:58:21
What a hypocrite. You're a supporter of BTC, a decentralized currency that gives people freedom to do as they please, but you're also supporting a company that thinks the opposite.

Our societal values (i don't speak for all of us) and our genetics determine how susceptible we are to conflict. 
The easy answer would be to have an authoritarian style society. The problem is that people dissent. You can't force people to consent. 
What we need is gradual change. Unfortunately, I'm not sure if we'll be able to make it before we kill ourselves and the planet.

How audacious of you to say that. Where's your proof? If Google sold us out, the government would have all of our private information, which they don't. 
Just like Apple in the iPhone cracking cases. Sure, I hate Apple, but they know that if there's one phone that can be cracked, then all phones could be, and they'd tank as a company since the public would lose trust in them. 
Same psychology with Google. No matter how malicious you think they are, they will never fully sell out their customers. They need us.

Have you ever looked into any of the comment history of the posters in that sub? 
Watch the times they post, also. Some of the accounts are strictly Moscow time 8am-5pm, like it's literally their job. 
You want to know the real conspiracy? got trolled hard as fuck, and continues to get trolled. But the dems got trolled even harder. 
I'll tell ya something though. You're not completely wrong about everything. Both the dems and republicans are right on some issues and wrong on some issues. 
There's some truth on for sure, but you gotta wade though all the troll accounts and obvious bots. Honestly, it's not even worth my time trying to sift through the bullshit on that sub anymore. 
Just skimming through your post history, I think you need to cool off for a minute dude. Understand that both sides are right and wrong on some issues. 
The minute you refute someone's argument only on the grounds that they're democrat, you become ignorant. 
[most of the donald in a nutshell](
But in the case that you're a troll, bravo. You stole ~20 minutes of my time.

It's not virtue signaling if I actually practice what I believe. And you don't know shit about me. I don't force myself on others. I just call people out when they're being hypocrites - like you are.

mBTC --&gt; bits --&gt; satoshis ???
People will/are call(ing) mBTC "millibits". Once the "early adoption" phase is over, BTC will rise to $100.000. That would be $1/bit. bit is nice and easy to say. will stick around for a while. The price very well just might rocket and stabilize at $1.000.000, making it $10/bit, but I think that $100.000 is a more reasonable stopping point for a while until the next halving - which is predicted to be around mid-2020, which is also around the same time people are predicting BTC to be $100.000. BTC will crash for a while, then eventually soar to $1.000.000, where it will be $1/satoshi. que mass adoption? only after this will people refer to BTC as satoshis.
