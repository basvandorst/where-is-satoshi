I wouldn't call today's comedians comedians. They all have the exact same views, all their comedy revolves around "Haha Trump such a moron eh?", and they're politically correct as hell because they're too afraid to "trigger" somebody and cause an outrage.

Btc-e went down almost two years ago. If you sent it there, it's gone.

Compared to McAfee's prediction it's pretty conservative.

So how do I see my true legitimate address where all these coins being received can be seen on the blockchain? Are they stored between all the addresses separately, and Electrum just centralizes them?
@_date: 2019-02-28 19:19:03
Okay cool, so after you use an address, it shouldn't be used again. 
What happens then when all the addresses on the electrum wallet have been used once?? Do they just start the cycle over again, as in, every address works its way up to 2 txs, then 3, etc.?
@_date: 2019-04-20 02:03:46
Jesus you're a fucking nutcase.
@_date: 2019-04-18 18:14:35
Anybody know if the Electrum servers are still getting DDOS'd?

I was wondering why I was unable to synchronize and see my new balance. Thanks for the information.

Plenty of Bitcoin use going on in countries with currency issues. Venezuela, Iran, Turkey etc.

It bubbled. People were buying alt coins and ICOs with no product and pumping them to obscene valuations. People were getting scammed(Bitconnect, etc.). Everything was overvalued. There was no way bitcoin deserved to be $19,500, just like in 2013 bitcoin shouldn't have been valued at $1100. What we are seeing now is bitcoin retracing to a place closer to it's true value.

I love this answer. I have done plenty of research on the current system. The Federal Reserve, fractional reserve banking, etc. I completely understand why Bitcoin is sound money, and that is what keeps me calm during these times. Of course the crazy speculative gains were nice, but i plan to be here for decades, as a hedge against any future economic crisis. 
Guess I'll start getting ready to buy more BTC as we approach the bottom. See you in a few years.

Interesting, Georgia is interested in crypto. I also know Belarus is really open to crypto as well. I believe Belarus and Czech Republic have no crypto capital gains taxes.

Cash is better than debit/credit (privacy).

I have dumb friends who bought during the bubble, are mad at me for talking about crypto, and stopped buying. I also have a rare few others who have continually bought during dips in 2018 and will continue to do so. Maybe the latter and myself turn out to be fools, but I doubt it.
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:25:12
I remember making my first buy at around 1-2k, and thinking fuck, I should have bought more then, instead of buying on the way up throughout 2017, lol.
Doesn't matter though. All that matters is how many Bitcoin I hold when the time comes that we all need it.

I was making a joke. 
Nevertheless, he's lucky nothing happened. Do you remember when Ron Paul spoke out against stuff like this? He got cheated out of the 2012 nomination. JFK spoke out against secret societies and the like, and he was domed in broad daylight.
If you don't think the bankers and those in power will use every method in the book to stay in power, including whacking people or possibly making crypto illegal, you're dumb.

I wonder how long until he suicides himself in the back of the head

Bernie doesn't even compare to Ron Paul. While I get the comparison you're making, Bernie wouldn't have been able to actually change the world the way Ron Paul (and now crypto) are attempting to. I would circlejerk somebody too if they were the best candidate in decades. 


I agree with you here, probably it's because they've gone the route of using the MSM as a FUD machine to convince every luddite normie that crypto is too risky, only used for drugs &amp; guns, etc. It seems to be working decent so far, especially with the recent dip in price.
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:34:09
Haha, you got me. Forgot that part.
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:00:41
Yes, correct. There was a lot of positive news surrounding crypto last year, particularly in November/December. What does that correlate with? The massive price. 
In general, for the last 9 years most mainstream news sources (Besides CNBC, they've actually been alright) have almost always been negative towards crypto. 80/20 negative/positive coverage historically doesn't make them in any way "pro crypto"
[For example](

Hey man, it's always good to have a large chunk of your portfolio in bitcoin, but don't avoid alt coins all together! Just avoid shitcoins like Digibyte, lol. 
If you're looking for some recommendations, I'm a big fan of NEO, XMR, OMG, LEND, NXS, ICX &amp; REQ. Good luck ☺

I honestly think Crypto Investor should have a much larger following than he currently does. In my opinion he does way better analysis than someone like Doug Polk who is basically a crypto version of PewDiePie.

Good news. Nothing has changed fundamentals wise, we just got too big too fast. We will be back!
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:23:05
I know, it's crazy. I just bought a bunch in person with cash for 6800 and then once i get home and check CMC it's already 500 up... ridiculous!

ATMs often allow you to buy anonymously with cash (for a fee of course).
