e-coin seems promising.

Windows is targeted more.  Writing malware and virii for Linux is just rude.

So was I. Why would I need your mailing address to return BTC.
@_date: 2014-05-24 18:56:55
Excellent job!
@_date: 2014-02-11 04:57:11
will this ever get confirmed? 
@_date: 2014-02-11 04:58:23
Sure. what's your mailing address.

This knowledge predates books on bitcoin.

I didn't know seized money was the cause of not having 1-to-1 USD on hand.  Did Tether show that was the case?
@_date: 2019-11-08 15:31:49
Ah, yea.  It has a satire quality I think.  We know there isn't hard evidence, but it makes for a hilarious meme.
@_date: 2019-11-08 12:14:38
Maybe forever; they never submitted to an audit.  Only after recent legal trouble did they change the story from 1-to-1 backing to backed in full by "other assets".  I'm not in the camp that believes they are doing anything fishy btw.
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:33:16
Don't tread in me!!!
@_date: 2019-11-08 14:52:02
You think that's what this illustration means to convey?
@_date: 2019-11-08 12:00:17
Tether is a fractional reserve--so it can print as many $1 bills as it wants.  Some suspect this is being used to pump the price of BTC, which is figuratively represented here as a sexy ass strip dance, baby.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:10:29
Yes!!! Now I can start using Bitcoin again for remittances without fearing the crash of the recent price frenzy.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:09:12
I just came to the subreddit hoping to show my friend one with the current price drop an all.
@_date: 2019-10-23 14:25:28
It's a reference
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:28:01
Not it isn't.  You clearly do not understand coinbase.  Even though they create the transaction, you can control the fee--as I did and always do.  They basically have a UI window that pipes the value to the transation command.  Also, I have a ticket, which is how I got they response informing of they service issue.  Finally, I am not asking the wrong people here.  Coinbase users use bitcoin.  This is the perfect place to find coinbase users.  I think you have it backwards.  You are the wrong person to be commenting here.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:32:24
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:11:31
Maybe I dont understand what you mean, but you add the fee when you make a transaction.  I added a $7 fee for example.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:01:17
So it seems you didn't reread my post.  I never asked anyone here for an explanation.  That is all in your head.  I asked if others were experiencing it.  That is information you can't get from Coinbase support.  Asking that question doesn't create drama in the slightest.  Drama is usually create when people, like yourself, fail to have the faintest clue about what someone is intending, but nevertheless attempt to drudge forward with incorrect assumptions.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:46:15
How are you this weird?  I experienced an issue with a BTC service.  Investigated it and then came to the online community where serveral people also use the service, and merely asked if anyone else was experiencing this particular problem.  Then you commented with an incorrect understanding of how the transaction fee window works in the service, and I corrected you.  That doesn't mean I know everything.  It doesnt mean that I think I know everything.  It only means that I knew how one thing worked where as you didn't.  Now, I reread everything before giving you this account.  I'd be interested in you doing the same, and pointing out my missteps.  I maintain that the issue here is just your wierdness, but perhaps you can convince me otherwise.  I am open to it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:19:07
Thanks man!
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:19:51
What fee are you talking about?  If you mean the mining fee, coinbase doesn't pay that.  You do.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:05:50
No, man.  Please reread my post.  Coinbase never broadcasted the transaction.  That is, even if there were miners, the transaction never made it to them to mine.  Coinbase is having issues outside of miners.
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:51:15
I don't think people are working just for me.  That's a lazy strawman your mind concocted.  I did what I could by compiling and testing code on his branch throughout the development process.  He answered every question I had and explained the backwards compatibility difficulties that slowed down the development. I love all his work with bech32 as well. Despite his hardwork and efforts, I still wish he had more dev support and that the release was prioritized more.  I know your "fuck you" was conditional on me, someone who writes free and open software, thinking devs somehow work for me--which I don't.  But I'll raise you an unconditional "fuck you" for your discivil response to my mere opinion.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:03:00
Like--all these crashes are fake calls of Bitcoin's death, but eventually it will really die?
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:51:51
Of course.  Damn you and your pets. :D
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:06:33
Agreed.  This is the release that will restore any lost confidence!
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:48:17
Bel? Acc? Don't tell me Cora.
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:00:41
No disrespect to Wuille, but we needed this much sooner.
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:00:47
3k in assets with a one million dollar personality ain't bad.
@_date: 2018-04-28 19:47:37
I don't think you know what the SEC is.
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:55:26
You ain't part of the 1+ club?
@_date: 2017-07-21 05:09:31


No.  It means that it appears Miners are claiming they will support SegWit.  Since we haven't heard from these miners (or "Miners") directly, we can only assume these signals as a claim.  Maybe widespread malware produced the signals against their will.


No, No, No - BIP148 will not force anyone that isn't using the protocol.  That is why a fork is possible.  People can simply not adopt a given BIP, and will not be forced to do anything.

I've done exactly this in the past--but with free building electricity instead of solar.  It will work for a while until the market drops.  And if you haven't exited your equipment before the drop and the market does not recover quickly, your hardware will depreciate in value by the increasing network difficulty.  Basically, enjoy it while it lasts, and I hope you don't get caught in a bitcoin drought--which you are historically likely to do.
