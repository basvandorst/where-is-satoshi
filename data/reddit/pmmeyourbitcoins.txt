8 cents is WAY too much money.  Not being sarcastic.
@_date: 2016-01-24 17:32:15
I totally agree.   But the issue now is that core devs have proven that they are unwilling to listen to the majority unless that majority says, then we are leaving you in the dust.  
Just not a great precedent.   Also, they argue that it's basically not safe and not necessary...  So if it's not safe and such an issue, why would they do it?

The USA?   Why do I need to post stats to prove that I don't mind an increase to 2mb....?
@_date: 2016-01-29 00:11:43
I can't believe a bitcoin developer would actually say this.  It goes against the very foundation of Bitcoin - to give the majority (normal people) power over the minority (banks and government).
Edit:  Some more unbelievable quotes that show just how personal this is getting:


. herd is often wrong. in your country coffee was very illegal for a long time. owning fruits of labour should be strongly protected.


. interesting question; say 99% decided to steal your money because you were in a minority of social norms that reversed in future.
So now if people want to change to higher transaction-per-block limits, we are stealing HIS money??
@_date: 2016-01-29 03:09:23
Indeed it is - which is partly why I thought this was important for people to see.

Relevant quote: "We are going to cease support for FSS-RBF after upgrading to version 0.12, some time in the next few weeks. We may not implement the opt-in RBF feature. We believe that we should do everything we can do to make 0-conf transactions as secure as possible. We do not believe the concept of fee market."
@_date: 2016-01-29 19:10:20
No, this is the market working as intended - because using that same argument from the opposite side (let's say we stick with 1MB blocks) many users will also sell their coins out of dissatisfaction due to the LACK of progress and LACK of change. 
Whatever happens, the market will voice its opinion and we will find out pretty quickly.
All I know is, if you were to ask me (which I know you aren't), I'd like to be on the majority side as I want my investment (time and money) to retain as much value as possible.
It also helps that the majority is *right* in this instance - we shouldn't have an artificially imposed limit to force us into FEE BASED sidechains that some of the Core Developers are using as a BUSINESS.   I'm not paying more money to use their side chains so they can make more money, period.

Yes I did a few hours ago, thank you for responding!  I wasn't worried that it failed or anything but rather that my entire balance disappeared completely with no withdraw history.. so to me it almost appears as if I never had a balance.  If you would like I can PM you my account name?  I actually looked for your reddit name but it hadn't commented in a month or so so I didn't go through PM.

That's fair, but similarly then that statement can be used to argue fees of 100s of dollars if you send a lot of money... and I guess it's all conjecture but I wouldn't believe that was the idea behind Bitcoin.  We already have services that do that..
@_date: 2016-01-28 19:50:36
I agree.  I am speaking specifically, though, about how it was a drop from 90%.  Overall though this makes me really happy - I'm glad to see some progress.  Although it may set a precedent and make things harder to accomplish in the future (maybe), at least right now there is forward progress.
Stagnation has been a problem.

One of the whole draws of Bitcoin was cheap transactions.   If I eventually have to pay 20bucks to send thousands of dollars I might as well use western union...  
@_date: 2016-01-29 20:20:45
I've been involved in Bitcoin for many years now, and I have done all my research thank you.   Even if we were to dismiss the idea of a transaction per block increase, I think many people agree with me that there is a direct conflict of interest to have a company contributing the majority of  code to something that at its very core (pun not intended) is supposed to be decentralized. 
What about rbf?   That was pushed out AND automatically opt in, when, once again, many people are in direct opposition (including miners) but we are just supposed to trust this company Block stream, even though it directly benefits them (as does small transaction per block size, fee based side chains, etc). 
@_date: 2016-01-22 13:36:23
Truthfully I wouldn't buy in until classic releases this month.   The reason being, I bet you can buy in cheaper later than now due to all the uncertainty surrounding the block size increase.  
This has nothing to do with support of either side but rather people are unsure of what will happen.   When there is uncertainty, price goes down.

@_date: 2016-01-28 18:22:55
I believe the change to a 75% majority is MUCH more reasonable.  Asking for 90%+ is ridiculous and would create more issues than solve (i.e. a single mining entity being able to veto it due to, as Gavin mentioned, coercion).
Limiting (or maintaining, more accurately) signatures is also a *brilliant* and simple solution to the claim that, by expanding transaction-per-block size, we are opening ourselves up to spam attacks.  Now this is not an issue at all.
I can't wait to voice my support via my nodes for 2MB block.  I believe binaries are being released from XT/Classic within the next 24-48 hours.  This can't happen soon enough.
Edit:  Please be aware this is not meant to shill for a specific client.  Regardless of my own beliefs, I was posting this so people who DO support the 2MB transaction-per-block change know that they have options to voice their support until Core implements their change officially.

@_date: 2016-01-29 00:46:36
It just blows my mind.  This is not tyranny of the majority in any way.  This is NOT about a developer, or one person - and he is showing he believes it is.  People who run Classic aren't voting for Toomin to be in charge of bitcoin, people who run Core aren't voting for these guys.  
They are voting for a change (or not) in PROTOCOL.  To act like he is losing the 'fruits of his labor' or having his money stolen is an unbelievable affront to anyone in the Bitcoin ecosystem.  It's a terrible twisted argument designed to confuse people.
I just hope this is done once and for all sooner than later.  It's obvious people are reacting to the uncertainty - and thus the price.
@_date: 2016-01-21 21:59:38
I'm not talking about blocksize though.. lol

This is the important part.  Also, as someone mentioned a few days ago, a fee that is 7 cents USD may be the cost of a bag of chips in some other countries (i.e. a couple bucks in their country).

Working as intended.  
@_date: 2016-01-24 18:42:37
The biggest concern of many right now is that a few months simply isn't quick enough.  Many blocks are approaching the transaction limit.  There is a consistent backlog of transactions waiting.  I can't tell you how many times I myself have personally had to wait a couple hours (not to mention others that mention the same issue) to get my transaction included in a block even with the recommended fee from the most recent Core client.
This is really just not acceptable when the change can be made much quicker, as being demonstrated by the goals of Classic, XT, and now the mentioning of a ridiculous 'patch' from the chinese miners.  
I respect the hell out of you guys for the work you have done getting the ecosystem to where it is, but it seems that the dev team overall is sitting on its hands and simply claiming 'roadmap,' when it's obviously a majority of users and miners want this increase ASAP.  
Regardless of reasons, it doesn't look good when inaction means higher fees from users to get their transactions included in blocks.  That makes people think it's on purpose.
I mean is it any surprise anymore that the Bitcoin price goes up when word comes out that block sizes will increase, and the price goes down when news comes out to the contrary?
@_date: 2016-01-18 15:41:27
Agreed completely.  Nothing puts people off more than those in charge - currently Core devs at this time - saying that "this is the right way because we are the experts - just trust us, worry not your little mind."
This is basically what everyone HATES when it comes to their own government, yet people are willing to accept it for some reason in this space.  I even saw someone respond to someone yesterday saying that the Bitcoin core devs were the ONLY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD who understood Bitcoin enough to make good changes.  THE WORLD.  
Relevant quote from "Well, there is the small problem that those are only people in the world that know how to program bitcoin competently. Aside from that, sure, get rid of 'em! They got us this far, but who cares! Burn everything to the ground."
Excellent write-up, and hopefully they will take this to heart.

When they closed your account did they allow you to remove your bitcoins or have you lost those assets? 
@_date: 2016-01-23 15:28:41
Yup, this is what the vast majority of people are arguing.  Why introduce an artificial fee-market well before block rewards are gone?  It is ruining the spread of bitcoin to make miners a few more bucks.  In the long run it's much more damaging than helpful even to them.
@_date: 2016-01-28 19:59:10
It's actually a tactic used in business.  Many people believe that is why Trump came out and said "ban all Muslims," so that if he gets into office he can "settle" for less than all.  Makes sense because then it looks like they are 'conceding.'

Can I ask why Gavin wants to see Bitcoin destroyed since a hardfork with a 2mb increase - which he is supporting by helping write the code?
@_date: 2016-01-19 01:56:33
Seriously.  Just throwing up their arms and quitting because people value certain things they don't is kind of juvenile.  The mature thing to do, if you actually DO care about Bitcoin, is contribute in any way you can to the path it takes.
If they only care about money and/or power, then sure, quit the job.  It's what I would do if I was unhappy in my job.  If you care about the principle and what it represents, you would think they would keep working to improve it and change the world, truthfully.

When the hell did this idea come about?  Ever since 2009 the idea was... use bitcoin and its blockchain for everything.  Replace dependence on banks and third parties.
@_date: 2016-01-24 22:07:50
I understand your point and it is completely valid.  However, when you have other trustworthy actors, some that used to be core devs (Gavin for example, possibly the most influential and important dev in bitcoin's history outside of Satoshi) laying out reasons why it WOULDN'T damage the network - and in fact that inaction can be more damaging -, you need to make an educated decision.  Sometimes the majority are right even if they aren't 'in the know' with the technical stuff as much as people on the frontline (core devs), such as in this case.
@_date: 2016-01-25 02:18:55
You would hope by rationally sitting down and talking about it, discussing implications, etc.  The ONLY reason I am so annoyed with Core Devs and their position is because they are *unwilling* to relent.  They really won't even open a dialogue about it - it's that they know, and because they are the experts, that's it.  That's the problem - not being open to another idea - maybe even a *better* idea.
@_date: 2016-01-21 21:42:44
Every time the price moves up or down my recommended fee costs me more or less money.  In both regards, that's not cool.  Why do I have to pay more or less fees for sending the same amount of money depending on the value of one bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-01-24 16:52:02
Yup.. smart decision, and let's hope this gets settled shortly.
@_date: 2016-01-23 00:00:43
As a full node operator, I could not disagree more.  
@_date: 2016-01-24 23:19:44
It certainly is, and I do.  But, I would say to wait until the 2mb hardfork.  The price will continue to stay where it is/stagnate/dip until we hear about that.  You probably have another week to get cheaper than 402 coins.
@_date: 2016-01-21 21:38:52
I think we need wallets like Core to start adjusting recommended fee based on daily price - or SOME reasonable way where the price fluctuation doesn't affect the fee.  Otherwise, the small .06 cent fee right now would double if the price doubles.  And, call me a cheapskate, but I am not okay with doubling my fee because my money is worth more.
Is this taken into account when setting recommended fees?  
@_date: 2016-01-21 14:09:37
I can only speak from experience, but quite a few times I have paid the recommended fee via the Bitcoin Core client and been stuck waiting 3-4 hours.  Any way you slice it that's not really acceptable.
@_date: 2016-01-24 15:38:41
Everyone had said from the beginning the issue is that core won't budge on the block size limit, when it's so painfully obvious everyone wants the limit to go to up to remove this artificial fee market.   
I think this is more damning of core than anything, since core has come out multiple times saying they won't do it this quickly.   If core changes their mind, that's all well and good, but it will be obvious *why*.   Not for the good of Bitcoin, but to stay in control.  
@_date: 2016-01-29 17:42:46
Which is exactly why the majority is important, and this garbage 'tyranny of the majority' argument simply doesn't apply here.  It's just a cop out argument because the minority (self-described by Adam Back via tweet yesterday) who support smaller blocks are afraid of losing this argument and having to go down the path described in this post by Gavin.
@_date: 2016-01-21 21:46:01
I'm not saying that it doesn't happen man.  But it certainly isn't consistent by any means..  Earlier the backlog was at 12k transactions, now it's at 4k.  
I've had recommended fee transactions stall for hours and hours and I've paid less and had them included.  That stuff points to one issue..
@_date: 2016-01-21 21:53:18
I just don't get the idea of spamming the blockchain.  A transaction is a transaction.  If I send 100 bucks with a recommended fee it shouldn't be a guessing game if it will take hours, go into an orphaned block or go through instantly.
@_date: 2016-01-28 18:42:49

It wouldn't grow linearly like that.   If we get a ton more users the the user base isn't the only thing that will go up.   Now that there will be a continuous backlog in the mempool if we gain that many more users, fees will increase as well as people try to one up each other to get in on the next block.   I'd imagine it'd be a good portion more than you think.

@_date: 2016-02-03 18:36:06
It's concerning that they received this money even in light of the fact that there is a chance (however small, or large)  that people move to 2mb clients and a hard fork occurs.  
There are only a few options here.   A, that they know the risk of blockstream going under after a hard fork and is worth the risk; b,  they are unaware of what's going on or c, blockstream's innovation doesn't require Bitcoin to succeed 
@_date: 2016-02-05 17:43:58

If this is true and not an isolated incident, this is an *outrage*.

Can we get a Coinbase rep here to talk about this?
I mean... at the very least you need to alert people before each and every transfer.  This could wreck some people this year.  Especially those of us that still have those coins but in a private wallet..

@_date: 2016-02-22 19:11:25
What you fail to realize is that 8 cents USD is a lot more in different, poorer countries.  People have posted multiple times that the transaction fee recommended can buy them chips and a soda in their country.  Now if suddenly we had to pay what they do equivalent in USD, about 3 bucks for chips and a soda, I bet you hear a lot more people complaining.
