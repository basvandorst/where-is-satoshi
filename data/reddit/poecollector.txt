To clarify, a genuine ledger does not come with a scratch off sheet. A fresh seed is created when you set up the device, and you must write it down. Trezor is the same. Order from the manufacturer and set up the device yourself!

What a great read. His an anxiety sounds very familiar to many of us in this community, especially the cold sweat waiting for a large transaction to be confirmed and hoping you didn't screw it up somehow.
@_date: 2018-01-03 06:30:02
Yes, I did the same thing with my Ledger Nano S last week. Here's what I did:
* Used the "cold storage" function of Mycelium to import the BIP38 key and send directly to my Ledger's address. (not to the mycelium address)
* Used Coinomi to sweep the same keys for Bcash and Bitcoin Gold. The balances then showed up in Coinomi.
* Sent bcash and bgold coins from Coinomi to an exchange and traded them for bitcoin and ethereum, which I then withdrew to the Ledger.
Make sure your Trezor or Ledger seed words are backed up correctly first! Send a tiny amount and then wipe the device and recover, make sure that process works as expected.
Also, it's unlikely your phone has malware that could grab the keys before you transfer. But I suggest making sure both android and the wallet apps are updated, and that you've downloaded the real app (with lots of reviews) not some scammy clone. You should be fine but it never hurts to be a little paranoid about such things.

Your portfolio should always reflect the % risk on each asset you are comfortable with. If your bitcoin was a small chunk of your portfolio which then became huge, it's totally reasonable to trade some for less exciting assets.

Thinking of doing the same. I have a paper wallet with a little bitcoin from before the forks. Any tips on the easiest way to trade my bcash and bgold while keeping the BTC safe?
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:47:53
Good post. For others that may be worried about future forks, just leave your bitcoins in cold storage. If there's long term value in a future fork then you'll be in on it. Think of it as diversifying with no effort. If instead a fork drops super low it's probably because its value was absorbed back into the original coin, which you also own. No need to be greedy and try and time the market hopping between forks.

You're basically right. It means marking coins so that they represent other things.
Let's say you have a company with 1000 shares of stock, and you want to just use bitcoin to distribute those shares.
You make a legally binding declaration that the 1 BTC you put in a particular address represents all the company's shares. That coin is now has a color, which is a way of saying it's a token of ownership for some other asset.
You could then sell little pieces of that colored bitcoin in exchange for normal bitcoins, and do it all in a bitcoin [transaction on the blockchain]( -- making the transaction publicly verifiable, secure, and frictionless. Everyone can see that someone who controls an address containing .006 of that colored coin owns six shares of the company.
That's the basic idea, but you'd need special wallet software to prevent anyone involved from confusing normal bitcoins with colored coins.

The presentation is really nice and the teas so far definitely seem higher quality than common loose leaf brands (e.g. Twinings). It varies from tea to tea, but for example, one of the green teas they sent me had only whole leaves -- not one broken leaf in the tin.
All in all not a bad choice if you're a tea snob looking for an excuse to spend some bits.

You can do this safely. The steps would be similar to my post above. I'll modify them for you:
1. [Download Ubuntu]( and burn it to a DVD or make a bootable flash drive with it.
1. Turn your PC off, then boot it into Ubuntu using the live DVD/USB.
1. Open a Firefox and visit [ Do not go anywhere else. Look at the address bar to make sure you are really at Github.
1. Download the .ZIP of that repository.
1. Now, turn your PC's wireless OFF. Double check to make sure you're offline. Do NOT turn the wireless back on until you're finished.
1. Open the webpage inside the ZIP. Skip the generator thing since you're not using that. Click the validate/decrypt tab.
1. Take off your tinfoil hat. You are using a clean OS with no internet. Enter your encrypted private key (it can even scan QRs with your webcam). Enter the password when prompted.
1. If it's correct, it will show you a public address and private key pair. Verify that the public address is the same as the one shown on the wallet. You can just eyeball this and see that the first few characters are identical. Don't connect to the internet yet!
1. Breathe a sigh of relief and turn off your computer. Wait a couple minutes for the memory to dump, then reboot as normal. 
You don't have to move your funds. Your keys still haven't been on the internet, not even the encrypted ones!

Mycelium and Hive are probably your two best options. Mycelium has some cool advanced features, like decrypting paper wallets. Hive IMO has a more appealing interface. Download both and see which you prefer.
Coinbase has a nice app, but it's not the best wallet since transactions are sometimes delayed.
Android phones aren't the most secure way to store BTC, so I'd only keep petty cash in it.
Personally, I keep about $25 in Hive, and refill it with a much more secure wallet.

Make sure you avoid losing it, but don't go crazy over its security. The point is you're adding a second point of failure that won't be easy for physical thieves, and will therefore buy you ample time to transfer the funds.

I'll tell you my process, without buying another computer. The trick is to use a a linux Live CD. I did a bunch of research and I tested this with serious money. It is safe, but read carefully:
1. [Download Ubuntu]( and burn it to a DVD or make a bootable flash drive with it.
1. Turn your PC off, then boot it into Ubuntu using the live DVD/USB.
1. Open a Firefox and visit [ Do not go anywhere else. Look at the address bar to make sure you are really at Github.
1. Download the .ZIP of that repository.
1. Now, turn your PC's wireless OFF. Double check to make sure you're offline. Do NOT turn the wireless back on until you're finished.
1. Now you can open the zip, and use the webpage in Firefox to generate your wallets. 
1. When printing wallets, use a basic printer that doesn't have a hard drive in it. A printer with no wireless ability is best, but if it's wireless just unplug your router temporarily, so the printer will fail to connect to the internet. Just print via USB.
8. Finished making wallets? Turn off the printer, turn off your PC, take the flash drive out. Wait a couple minutes afterward for the memory to dump on the PC and printer.
If you follow that, your private keys will have never touched the internet. They were created an destroyed in a clean OS while offline. You're now OK to reboot as normal and reconnect everything; there will be no keys on your computer to steal.

If you are in the US, your crypto holdings are irrelevant until you sell. However, trading one crypto for another counts as selling at a price of whatever the USD value was on that day.
Once you sell, you must report it as capital gains or losses when you file taxes for that year.  If you hold for at least a year before selling, the capital gains tax will be lower.
It is the same thing with any other commodity, such as precious metals.

I think in the context of economics, intrinsic value would be something that is useful even if no one else agrees that it's useful. If I have bushels of wheat, or a gallon of gasoline, I can use them (to eat or to get someplace) regardless of whether someone else acknowledges their value. 
So, using intrinsic value as the criteria, everything we normally call "money" including bitcoin is fiat, because it's ultimately just a number in a system.
A trickier thing to define is something like gold. It's a useful metal, but its monetary value is vastly disproportionate its usefulness. It's rare and shiny and slightly useful, and so we kind of arbitrarily decided it's extremely valuable.

Agreed. It's likely USD will inflate by 2 or 3% in a year, but a typical student loan APR is about 5 or 6%, so adjusting for inflation the loan still has an interest rate of about 3%.
But if we bring bitcoin into the mix, it gets tricky. On the one hand, selling it to pay debts is tempting because bitcoin is so unpredictable, and debt is a concrete "problem" you can solve by selling.
On the other hand, I refuse to sell an asset while it's experiencing value growth at a rate that leaves my student loan APR in the dust.

My sympathies. For next time, an easy way to have pretty good security is use Electrum on a computer with good anti-spyware or linux. You can memorize the seed, creating a brain wallet, but it's sufficiently random that brute force would take an impossibly long time.

@_date: 2013-09-22 00:50:15
In that case, your English is pretty good. Here's the difference between much and many: much refers to a category of something, or an amount you wouldn't count in distinct units. So you might say "I ate too much pizza", but you would say "I ate too many pieces of pizza," because pieces are distinct, countable units of pizza.
Similarly you would say "so much change" but you could also say "so many coins," because coins are the distinct units of change.

@_date: 2013-09-14 01:32:51
Armory is good. Like AgentZeroM I prefer electrum. After some research, I decided on what I believed to be a good balance between security and convenience, and did the following:
1. Make doubly sure you have no spyware (especially if running Windows).
2. Download Electrum and create a new wallet
3. Encrypt the wallet with a nonsense passphrase you haven't used elsewhere, e.g. "onion dance light mud blue pickles"
4. Write down the passphrase and the seed on a piece of paper and hide it somewhere safe with no explanation attached to it. If you're up to it, memorize it.
If you want even greater security (but less convenience), do the above on a spare linux computer and keep it offline, connecting only when you're sending money from it.
