As Menger wrote in his 1871 work, Principles of Economics:  
"Value is thus nothing inherent in goods, no property of them, nor an independent thing existing only by itself. It is a judgement economizing men make about the importance of goods at their disposal for the maintenance of their lives and well-being. Hence value does not exist outside the consciousness of men."

Latvian-born American photographer Philippe Halsman (right) photographs Spanish Surrealist artist Salvador Dali as he poses with each of the points of his signature mustache piercing a $10,000 bill, (1954). 
Armed guards escorted the two bills from the Federal Reserve to the photo shoot. They were alarmed and displeased when Philippe Halsman pierced holes into each so he could thread Dali's signature mustache through.
