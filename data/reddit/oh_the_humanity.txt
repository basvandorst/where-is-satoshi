Exodus has no way to do user adjustable fees, and will rape you with all these mempool spam attacks going on. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:58:47
I have to disagree with you due to the fact that will not let users set fees instead relies on  to set fees at the fastest confirmations. Currently with the mempool under constant attack its causing fees to be outrageous. I used it as a beginner and now regret it.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:29:34
I think thats your change.

Too bad their support is absolutely atrocious. I probably wont ever buy another one of their products, and will suggest to others to look elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:20:31
And this is just as secure as using the native chrome apps?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:52:48
Time will tell. But that same TX would never be confirmed today.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:07:01
The BTC app is decent, the ETH wallet is very bare bones. Leaves a little to be desired IMHO.

You obviously haven't tried transacting this week. It not just coinbase and bitpay.

How did you go about easily transferring the ERC20 tokens to your ledger?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:14:35
If it cant be moved without loosing huge percentages of your value, then it is worthless.

@_date: 2017-12-21 17:01:41
It's not just narrative, have you tried transacting this week? Its gone from bad to outrageous and it just keeps getting worse day by day. Its completely unusable. If something is unusable, it will not take very long for other alternatives to grow. Were talking days and weeks. There is a real problem, and its happening right now.

I didnt do any of it, and I very well could be wrong. Was just remembering something about it when this was going around back when he/she first started this up.

While that might be true, I believe its been worked out based on comment history/ twitter handle sleuthing/stalking.

Can't the argument be made that, the intrinsic value of bitcoin is two parts its guaranteed rarity based on the maximum number of coins and time/difficulty to mine, plus the fact that any sum of value from 1 cent to 1 million+ dollars worth of value can be instantly transferred any where in the world with minuscule fees and no middleman, any time of the day or night. That in itself is a value thing that doesn't exist anywhere else (save other cryptos)

Cheer up thats only almost a house depending on where you line in the US.
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:38:14
That is why I preferenced it with "depending on where you live."

Slow down tiger, it hasen't been released yet. This is an announcement to make you aware of an upcoming announcement. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 20:00:49
I second this sentiment. I've dealt with many companies. Ledgers support is one of the worst I've ever dealt with. Nice product, bad support.
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:01:25
Try not to fanboy too hard, their support is still atrocious.
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:23:56
Wait wait wait... WTF did I miss? I thought the real Satoshi is unknown. How did he prove his authenticity? Did he transact from known Satoshi coins?
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:07:30
Ah interesting I had not heard the distinction but to be honest it doesn't matter much, most people are not using them on a ChromeOS device.
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:42:38
It's not worth all that for me.
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:30:04
Oh hah hah hah.. hilarious /s
@_date: 2018-02-23 16:59:32
Blame google, they are shutting down app support. This has forced ledgers hands.
@_date: 2018-07-13 15:07:50
Ah gotcha.

Is that near Walmart? 64th ave  or something ?

If you are going to say that you put your money in a bank, and some robbers found that the bank accidentally left the back door open one night, and the robbers stole all of the money you had there that your cool with that? "Good on em! That'll teach those banks to do a better job." "What ? my thousands that they took? Nah its cool. Im glad they took the money, as long as the banks get taught their lesson."
@_date: 2017-07-30 00:52:57
Its not a strawman argument, its a direct analog of what you basically have stated above. Because its not your money that you lost, you have no skin in the game. To say otherwise means your either full of it, or just really stupid. Pick one.

This is the second reference to this .. where is that coming from?
@_date: 2017-07-29 20:58:37
If those were your coins that were stolen from Mt. Gox you'd probably feel a little differently about it.
