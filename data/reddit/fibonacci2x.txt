So coinbase allows the users of r/bitcoin and many more access to their bch to dump and buy more bitcoin and you guys are freaking out, this should be viewed as a positive for the true bitcoin users. If they allowed access right away many would have sold for less. Coinbase doesn’t even have segwit addresses yet, that is the real crime here, not the all of a sudden access and trading to BCH.

I really hope I come across one of these, I probably wouldn't spend it, just keep it maybe even frame it, as it continuously decreases in value year after year

Deposit cash onto coinbase then dollar cost average $10/day on gdax for 20 days or $20/day for 10 days. And the percentage gain will be the same now matter how much you invest

In order for it to be worth billions, $200 in today's dollars to be worth $2 billion (you said billions meaning more than 1) bitcoin would have to be worth $232.5 billion. Please feel free to check my math there was a lot of commas

Just watched his interview from today with questions regarding bitcoin, from the way he spoke about it, it sounds like he doesn't have a true understanding of coin itself and the tech behind it. Also he goes on to give a perfect use case for Bitcoin, which he said it would have been helpful in Venezuela and Cuba
