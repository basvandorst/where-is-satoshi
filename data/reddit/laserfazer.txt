Report them for what? Having an opinion?

Dear Coinbase: I want to know when I can start using Coinbase.

I was rooting for it to go even lower in order to buy more. I suppose if I had a huge balance I'd have been nervous.

Which exchange did you use?

Sitting president*. And who gives a fuck what he mentions, he's a complete fraud.

Wow Gabe, ya knocked that one out of the park! I stand defenseless and in awe of your penetrating wit!

 nobody knows who he is,  the bitcoins haven't moved,  he's probably dead.

I'll bet you're a blast at parties.

I'm new and as I was researching today, I really wanted to use Exodus, as I wanted a desktop wallet for Mac. There were enough warnings about it not being open source that I decided against it and ended up using mycelium for Android.
So... Isn't the fact that it isn't open source enough to stay away? That you're being asked to trust the developers that they don't do anything screwy with your bitcoins?
Like I said, I'm new but the warning sounded good enough for me.

That's right, encourage him.
@_date: 2019-06-30 20:21:20
Oh fuck Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-30 22:39:20
I heartily concur.

I think I'll wait until it goes back to 6k next week.

Oh, to get rich for sure. I bought just $550, now it's worth $210 and I am looking at Maserati catalogues.
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:41:05
It'll be 3200 by next week.
