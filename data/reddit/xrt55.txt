When then?  Without a release date, that just means forever.

The media is now saying it's never coming.  Perhaps I should believe that.  That seems more accurate.  Waiting forever with no real set date is far shittier.  Screw testnet it's been three years now.

It's going to have problems.  It's better to see them sooner imo.  Everyone knows it's alpha, alpha.  I'd just warn people.  Hell it'll be alpha for a year anyhow.

I'm wondering what the timeline is for out of testnet and working with major companies starting to set up hubs.   It could be on testnet for a long time possibly.  In other words, that doesn't really give us a real indication of a timeline for production and adoption.  Thanks

Cash for bitcoin.

Personally I believe over time more and more people will simply hold a certain amount of bitcoin, this will squeeze the supply even further leaving less and less to trade.  Each time there is a bubble it brings in an amount of new people what will just keep holding increasing the overall size of the value.  I just don't see this stopping long term.

They are going to do that anyway.  Are we to hold it off forever?  That's far worse.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:52:30
Honestly they just need to go mainnet and say it's super alpha to not put more than 20 bucks worth of bitcoin in.

Also, the sticky should include donation addresses.  That would be cool to.  I bet as we get closer and closer people would be willing to donate a lot more--especially companies and services that will use it.

Can you withdraw to your bank account for a cheaper rate?
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:02:18
There doesn't seem to be any currently working implementations.  Last I heard on this sub was it was at 90%.  
Honestly I'd like to see some large companies start to offer services through Lightning.

They make stuff up anyway.  Who cares?  No one believes the media any more.

10 billion a year is nothing for a world currency.  Talk to me when it's a trillion.

This seems oddly hostile.  I'm sure many just want to know the status and we don't know where to get that from.  This isn't some kind of attack.   
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:33:38
No it's an awful idea for you.  You don't represent the rest of us.  You're free to make a bitcoin of your own though where no one cares if they ever deliver on features and the time that happens.

Theoretically some larger company could open the channel for them, give complete control over it to them and then they could receive and send bitcoin that way.  The larger company would collect the transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:59:10
Yes, but so, they are moving.  Who cares if people bitch?  They'll bitch anyway.
