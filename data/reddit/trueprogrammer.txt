No ads, no investors pushing agenda, fully independent. Short, up-to-the point news. We mostly try to post news with telling headlines, so that the important thing is in the headline, not the body.

We have email notifications and on-site notifications.

Perhaps, because user hodls one of the keys to the multisig escrow.
@_date: 2017-04-24 16:40:53
It's on the frontpage, exchange fee is 0.6%.

We'll add Bitsquare.


In short: the frontend Javascript generates seed, encrypts it. You can inspect it. User's key is only accessible to the user himself. Backend prepares the transaction, frontend verifies and signs it, backend then signs it with the exchange key and broadcasts it.

1. The Paypal question: a) don't forget this is a demo b) while we're not going to restrict traders from creating offers with Paypal as a payment method, I don't think it'd be the most popular choice, given known issues. Premiums and payment windows for such offers would obviously be much higher.
2. Theoretically one could hack an asset server and change Javascript to generate wrong keys. While this is possible, it's much more difficult and the implications are less severe - only current trades would be affected. This is in contrast with centralized exchanges such as Localbitcoins: not only do they hold bitcoins in their own wallet, the incentives for hackers to hack them are actually much stronger, since a lot more bitcoins can potentially be stolen.
3. The site IS NOT holding user's private key.


That's exactly what's going on.
@_date: 2017-04-24 20:11:08
Ok, so I think this is nothing new and Localbitcoins, which has been working for years, has the same problem.
Paypal is known to be a very bad choice to trade BTC for years. Thus, people trading Bitcoin with Paypal on Localbitcoins usually have higher premiums and much longer payment windows set. Also, no one really exchanges large amounts with traders with less than perfect reputation and many trades in their history.
Many other payment options are non-reversible, that's why people use them willingly. Surprisingly, many countries have a variety of instant irreversible payment options. For example, Thailand, Russia, Ukraine all have instant internet-banking payments, in Spain you can withdraw cash from an ATM without a card even (phone number and a security code needed). Your PayPal example is no way a demonstration of why the exchange won't work, but merely an evidence that PayPal itself is just horrible.

Frontend code is already de-facto opensourced, but we'll be making it readable and available on Github for sure. Backend code need not be opensourced, as it only generates transactions and without the opensourced frontend verifying and signing them nothing will work anyway. Hope that addresses your concern.
@_date: 2017-04-25 10:26:59
We eat failure for breakfast.
@_date: 2017-04-24 17:29:15
Thanks, we're working on better mobile experience. Will fix that soon.
@_date: 2017-04-25 12:47:50
I'd say ~3 months from now. It's hard to say with absolute certainty at this point.
@_date: 2017-04-24 15:22:02
Founder here.
We'd like to point out a couple of things:
1. TESTNET is here to stay even after mainnet launch. The goal is not to just find issues before they go into the mainnet version, but to also allow people to learn how to trade Bitcoin without the fear of losing money.
2. For those interested in thorough discussion about our exchange, we'd welcome you to our Telegram group:  We're also obviously on twitter to answer shorter questions: 
3. Our Bitcoin News website has been around for a while, it's part of the effort to bring an exceptional trading experience: 
Of course, any questions are also welcomed here on reddit.
@_date: 2016-09-28 22:22:49
We try to post as little as possible, unless it is more or less affects Bitcoin and its perception.
@_date: 2018-02-24 11:49:21
2-out-of-3 actually makes us more vulnerable to attacks because the seller posing as an independent arbiter holding another key can easily refund his locked coins and effectively steal from the buyer who sent him fiat funds.
@_date: 2018-02-24 02:22:49
As with any other exchange. Except in our case, there is no incentive for us to disappear, as we can't get access to the funds. Same applies to anyone trying to take over. Wouldn't you say it's safer by definition?
@_date: 2018-02-24 02:09:27
No, this 2 out of 2. One key belongs to the seller, the other belongs to the exchange. The exchange cannot steal the funds, because to sign a transaction both keys are needed - the exchange doesn't know the seller's key. That's why it says "Hodl Hodl exchange only holds one-out-of-two keys to the multisig escrow". Please read that slowly.
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:46:56
Not yet, working on it.
@_date: 2018-04-17 08:46:47
You may say you're paying directly to the buyer. The funds are temporarily locked on a p2sh escrow address, which Hodl Hodl can't do anything with without the seller's approval (signature). Bitcoins are then released to the buyer's address.
@_date: 2018-04-17 10:45:32
Indeed, we monitor for our exchange name. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 10:52:35
I'm sorry,  but what exactly is your problem with Hodl Hodl? The news is about Localbitcoins introducing KYC/AML which we dont have. We work our asses off to create a great product for our users (spending our own money,  btw,  as we're  not making any just yet) and yes, it's a convenient opportunity to mention it. Because you sound like we're pushing some sort of scam or ICO down people's throats. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 05:03:17
Uhm, so what kind of scam would it be for the seller? Lock your bitcoins and destroy your reputation on the exchange? Like, where's the upside of NOT releasing bitcoins to the seller? What exactly is the hack? We've heard these claims many times before, but the problem is that there's literally no incentive for the seller to behave in such a way.
Yes, there are hypothetical situations where bitcoins may remain locked forever. Once again, such is the risk of this platform. Localbitcoins and Paxful have other risks, such as storing all users' bitcoins centrally. Pick the risks you prefer to take.
@_date: 2018-04-17 08:50:51
We actually have a testnet version where you can play with contracts with testnet bitcoins (that is, free of charge with no risk, just to familiarize yourself with the workflow). And there are educational videos on how to use Hodl Hodl available on YouTube and on the exchange frontpage: 
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:56:32
If the fee is smaller than the current dust limit we actually wave it. But it can be smaller than the network fee.
@_date: 2016-10-24 20:21:27
All suggestions in this thread will be carefully considered and are welcome. We're looking to improve this instrument and this is only the first version of it. While basic at the moment, we hope it will be able to become a valuable addition to the Bitcoin infrastructure.
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:31:13
Yes, we intend to charge a fee starting this summer (lower than Localbitcoins, btw), but for now it's completely free - a 0% fee.
@_date: 2018-04-17 08:30:49
Not all the power. We won't sign a refund transaction unless we have reasons to believe buyer is a fraud or unless the contract was cancelled by the buyer himself. Worst case, funds remain locked in escrow. But what would be the point of that for the seller?
@_date: 2018-04-18 09:07:34
@_date: 2018-04-18 06:01:54
Ah, now I get what you mean. And that is also why we will be introducing safety deposits, which will be associated with trades, so in case of a rouge seller, he loses the deposit and this kind of attack, even though unlikely, would now have a cost.
@_date: 2018-04-18 04:25:47
Yes, there are situations where funds may remain locked indefinitely and Hodl Hodl wouldn't be able to unlock them as it lacks the key. That's just a trade off. With Localbitcoins and Paxful you have another trade off which is that they are honeypots for hackers: they store bitcoins in their own wallet and if they're hacked, money is lost. Hodl Hodl offers a much more secure trading alternative, however it does come with this trade off.
We are planning to add 2-out-of-3 keys scheme in the future with independent mediators holding the 3d key, so this might be something a certain group of customers feel more at comfortable with.
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:34:02
The release transaction generated by Hodl Hodl (but signed by both us and the user) contains a separate exchange fee output.
@_date: 2018-04-17 10:43:03
We have key backups. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:30:11
Why would we want to update the private key in real time? :)
@_date: 2018-04-17 05:25:41
Hi, Hodl Hodl here. When you create a contract with someone, a new [p2sh] multisig escrow address is generated. The seller deposits bitcoins to this address. It is a special address because to unlock the funds from it and send bitcoins somewhere else two keys are required: one key is held by Hodl Hodl, but the other key is generated on the user's side (in the frontend, the browser) and is never stored on Hodl Hodl's server. Thus, even if our server is hacked, the funds are safe.
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:16:10
What do you mean by "replications"? A key is a key. We obviously store it in many places. If the server is hacked and our key is deleted from it, we of course have a back up key stored safely.
We also do regular backups of our database, so if something goes wrong we can, of course, come back up after an investigation.
@_date: 2018-04-17 08:53:27
Perhaps you are mistaken, we've never written a whitepaper, but we have an extensive FAQ on the website: 
Yes, you're paying fiat directly to the seller who's selling you bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-05-01 19:30:53
1. We try to store as little data as possible. Only email and password are required to sign up. Obviously those are not enough for anyone to identify a person. I agree that Bitsquare is more resistant to government censorship, however it is so at a price of being much more difficult to install and use. Or goal is to be safer than Localbitcoins and more user friendly than both Localbitcoins and Bitsquare.
2. I haven't had a chance to look at multisigna in detail, but I suppose both use Bitcoin multisig. The real difference is UI and workflow at this point, which, hopefully, users find is a lot more convenient and advanced on Hodl Hodl. We put a lot of effort in developing UI and testing the workfow thoroughly, it took us a year of work. From the looks of it multisigna doesn't have that, but perhaps I'm wrong. We also have a testnet version where users can learn how to trade, multisigna doesn't seem to have that.
