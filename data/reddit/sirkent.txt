I'm no expert, but my guess is that 3rd party services will be created that optimize paths if the network is decentralized (e.g. everyone is only connected to their friends). However, since regular users are unlikely to keep a server running, there would likely be supernodes that effectively act as large hubs in which others connect to on demand. This structure may act like a bank (in the sense that your BTC is locked up), and it's likely supernodes would be at most 1 or 2 edges away. The supernodes will have to lock up their own BTC in order to pay others, it's likely that they'd only do it when there is financial incentive (e.g. a merchant).

Yes, the discount is subsidized directly by the bitcoin buyer. The 10% is actually just the recommended amount. Currently, we have less people spending BTC than buyers, so even orders of 25% discount get taken within a few hours.

Ripple is two things that people get confused about.
1. It's a currency (XRP) that's premined by opencoin and used for network transaction fees.
2. A credit network (rather than payment network that Bitcoin is) in which users can extend credit to peers. This system is **extremely** powerful as a complement of cryptocurrencies because it allows for decentralized exchanges (among other crazy things). 
Granted that opencoin's implementation isn't decentralized and suffers, they open sourced their code. If we can get a decentralized fork going, we can turn ripple monetary system ( into a reality.

To further explain the issue: We charge a 0.1 mBTC flat fee for withdraws, regardless of how much the fee actually turns out to be. Vast majority cases, they are 0.1 mBTC, but sometimes it's higher. We sent 0 fee transactions to average things out, but only on high priority transactions (large withdraws with old inputs). These 0 fee transactions are completely legitimate almost always gets confirmed the next block. 
What occurred with OP was largely due to the improbable event of **very slow block discovery**. There was only 1 block discovered in roughly 1 hour preceding that transaction. Thus, the following blocks were jammed with tons of other transactions waiting to be confirmed. Some miners apparently apply artificially low tx caps to their blocks, which made it worse. This is the nature of such a decentralized network. 
Regardless, we are now enforcing a minimum 0.1 mBTC fee.

In addition to what everyone else said, these big drops that we've seen lately can be attributed to a few types of people:
1. scammers/hackers who stole a lot of bitcoins that are cashing out.
2. old money who are cashing out.
3. (conspiracy theory) CIA or similar group whose interest isn't to make money, but rather control/destroy the bitcoin economy. If what kdoto said is true, then option 3 might be the case. I attributed the last drop (when it went from $5 to 2.50) to the bitcoin7 ordeal, but I do not know if there was this sell/bid wall that kdoto claims. 
If it's option 1 or 2, I think it's an overall good thing for the bitcoin economy, as the distribution of wealth will be more even. If it's option 3, then who knows..
Anyone, please critique me on this analysis, because unless you're "cashing out," trying to control the market results in a negative net value transaction.

Yes there is the novelty factor. Building an agent would essentially to build an AI that can compete with humans on an open market. The challenge would on a different level than anything we have today. If they would survive, they'd make humans obsolete. Maybe we'd get new jobs as upgrade software writers for the agents, but a new agent can potentially dominate that indusrty. We'd all be useless at that point. Not saying it's objectively bad, survival of the fittest after all. But it certainly wouldn't bring the same benefits to ourselves that Bitcoin would.

Yes of course. Like I said, most are here to make money. But we need to be careful. Proper education of the fundamentals of bitcoin will create more confidence in long term hoarding.

The system wasn't "upgraded" so to speak. Orders can only be placed at a limited rate now. If anything, it's a restrictive downgrade. It does it's job of preventing people from abusing the order placement system to lag up the system. In addition, lag can occur without any volume taking place. For example, before the change, someone can place 1000 orders for 0.01 btc sells at $1000-$2000 a piece at various increments. As long as he has 10BTC in his account, those individual orders will be added to the orderbook, and the system will lag. No actual transactions would be made.

Can any algorithm experts explain why mtgox always lags so bad during high volumes? Why wouldn't a quality cloud service benefit them? As it has been the past few months, the only time worth "trading" is during times like these, and those are the times the lag makes it impossible to trade. 
I'd imagine that by simply taking a digit or two off of the USD prices would reduce the lag significantly. Changing fee structures to incentivize those that provide liquidity, rather than those who buy into the order books.

A bit off topic but Bitcoin Foundation looks like an oligarchy to me:
1. 3 of the 5 board members are CEOs of MtGox, BitInstant, Coinlab
1. 1 media guy 
1. 1 developer
1. A lawyer as general counsel
Founder is coinlab CEO, and two seats are reserved as corporate seats, so there will always be a majority corporate influence. 
1. Standardizing Bitcoin - *As a non-political online money, Bitcoin is backed exclusively by code. This means that—ultimately—it is only as good as its software design. By funding the Bitcoin infrastructure, including a core development team, we can make Bitcoin more respected, trusted and useful to people worldwide.* **Paying Gavin**
1. Protecting Bitcion - *Cryptography is the key to Bitcoin’s success. It’s the reason that no one can double spend, counterfeit or steal Bitcoins. If Bitcoin is to be a viable money for both current users and future adopters, we need to maintain, improve and legally protect the integrity of the protocol.* **The protocol was fine for the 3.5 years before the existence of the foundation**
1. Promoting Bitcion - *In the context of public misunderstandings, misinterpretations and misrepresentations, Bitcoin needs to be clearer about its purpose and technology. Allowing the community to speak through a single source will enable Bitcoin to improve its reputation.* **They have done very good job of this** 
[Why we need a foundation]( doesn't answer the question. 
*botnets that attempt to undermine the network, hackers that threaten wallets* **Couldn't help MtGox**
**[Join as company benefits](
1. Observing rights for board meetings
1. Voting rights for one board seat exclusive to Platinum members
1. First **right of refusal** for sponsorship opportunities at annual conference
1. The right to run for Bitcoin Foundation board seats and influence the direction of the organization
1. Exclusive networking opportunities with members of the foundation community through members-only forum
Gold + Silver gist: Can vote for other corporate seat, can run for board member, can access forums. 
**[Join as individual](
*To promote transparency and enforce fair voting procedures, we require a real name and address for Individual members.* **There are no description of any benefits. If the only benefit is to vote on the board members, they won't get that vote until July 31, 2014 (effectively making the annual membership benefitless**
Forums are not accessible to anyone but corporate members
**[Oh they give out grants?](
*Some areas we all felt pretty strongly we wouldn’t give grants for*
1. *Viable Business Ideas* 
1. *Publications* **Both contradicts previously stated interests/mission**
1. *We had a hard time with a third category — highly interesting ideas about protocol changes, or enhancements to Bitcoin.* **They don't want improvements to bitcoin? What are they paying Gavin for?**
*One the Foundation (and CoinLab) could use would be something designed to let finance people interact with their balances like a historical ledger; aggregating up accounts for Income Statements and Balance Sheets, and separating them out for assessing who got paid when.* **Right, that's what bitcoin needs! Free development work for CoinLab**
[What they ended up giving the grants to]( Two testnet proposals: A faucet that gives out coins that no one wants, and *DNS seed for TestNet to make it easier for TestNet-using nodes to sync with the network.* 
No proposals were actually published, including the winning ones. 
The only other thing they have done is Bitcoin 2013 conference, which again is another commercial venture (that MtGox and CoinLab can deny you entry to). 
**But yes, Max Keiser is nuts.**

@_date: 2013-04-10 05:30:30
On the contrary:
**Dot-Com bubble:**
Where are we today with Dot-Coms? Google.com, Facebook.com, Youtube.com, etc. What then is a tech bubble? It is mother nature's way of weeding out the weak to make room for new and better species. Yes, bubbles are a part of nature, like the reptilian bubble that occured 450 million years ago. Thankfully that bubble popped 65M years ago to allow sentient beings to exsit today. 
Yes, many companies like Webvan was fundementally flawed, but if someone who believed in the technology (the Internet, that is) invested a little in every Dot-Com company series A since the 90s, I bet that man would be rich today. The analogus bubble occurred for Bitcoin in mid 2011. Those who bought at $20 and sold at $10 lost half of their investment in a matter of days. Those that bought at $20 and held it to this day just made a 1100% profit. (Joke: The guy who bought two pizzas for 10,000 BTC is the dinosaur).
My intepretation of the state of Bitcoin today (compared to history) is more akin to the first couple guys who found gold nuggets in the local river -- It's nice and shinny! I'll sell this nugget for some sea shells (the currency at the time). Some time later: "Grandpa traded gold for sea shells and that's why we're poor?"
No one knows if the current market is a bubble. But the previous bitcoin bubble and dot-com bubble are examples of what to do if it is. As long as the fundamentals are sound, go long.
[more]( 
Edit: I'm not sure why I'm getting down voted. I wasn't sure about the value of stocks, but my point is that the Internet today brings much more "value" than it did in 1999. If the fundamental benefits of some technology is that great, there may be ups and downs along the way, but the destination will always be top.

That's interesting if true. It would *perhaps* be a negative for bitcoin. If the borrower has to think really hard about whether or not to borrow, many would choose not to. That results in higher scammer/defaulter to good loans ratio, increasing the interest rate demanded by lenders -&gt; feedback loop. 
This would hinder businesses from growing, unless the entire model moves from lending to equity (investing).

1. I'd say that localbitcoin could be considered a distributed exchange. Given that it reaches some level, local communities will form. Even if the site is shut down, new (more distributed) sites can pop up. 
2. Yes the USD coin probably doesn't make much sense USD itself is controlled by centralized agency. But there could potentially be a distributed crypto-currency exchange, where anyone can be the mediator/escrow, and all orders are public. Both parties just have to agree to the same escrow. 
3. Even with physical cash, [Hawala]( has proven to be useful in transferring cash quickly across long distances. All that is needed is credit. This is essentially the system ripple tries to generalize.

Given that Avalon ASICs are produced using 110 nm transistors, and top of the line chips are currently at ~14 nm, the performance difference is probably enormous.

1. There are the [their by laws](
1. [Law Suit](  [contract]( and a comment by someone whom I will not reveal: 
Coinlab is almost certainly in violation of F.2 - "During a period of two years from the start of the Term, CoinLab shall not, directly or indirectly (including through legal entities ultimately owned by the same person or persons as CoinLab) provide services similar to theServices on any website. During said two years period, CoinLab may provide the Services to the CoinLab Customersonly on the MtGox Website or on a CoinLab Website."
1. I haven't parsed though all that stuff yet, but Section 5 of the by laws states that only 3 of the board members are needed to start a quorum, and majority is just two of them. So it only takes 2 people to abuse their power (if you allow them to have any).
1. **Shameless Advertisement Warning** As this is one of my most top voted comments ever, I'd like to take this opportunity to advertise a new project to be released in several months. I always believed that things should be cheaper in bitcoin (since the risk of fraud is not factored into the retail price) and we will attempt to make that a reality. Register in and you'll be amongst the first to test the service.

Computer being compromised won't get the password until you type in the password, so there may be some time between the two events for you to discover the threat. 
Yes blockchain.info sends private keys encrypted using AES, but SMTP is the email protocol they use to send that email. You have a strong password which is great, but I am evaluating this as the typical case of risk/reward between local and online wallets. I don't believe anyone would say online is more secure. A low overhead wallet like electrum is really not a big deal; it's certainly not any slower than the JS that blockchain.info runs on your browser. 
Another attack vector I forgot to mention is blockchain.info can alter the live code to steal the password rather than decrypt the wallet, thus giving them access to you wallet. This is probably the most threatening attack for the security savvy. Remember that the whole point of bitcoin is to minimize trust requirements. 
All being said, I have no reason to believe they would do that, and an online wallet has its advantage for amounts you'd put in your real wallet. Considering how many noobs lost their bitcoins to inputs.io, I try am just trying to give them proper digest on the matter of web wallets.

I don't actually recommend paper wallets to most noobs. It requires more understanding to accommodate the ways you could lose them. Some (possibly fake) dice site user sent a few thousand coins to a paper wallet that was in the trash a while back. You're more prone to such mistakes, fire, or theft with paper wallets.

1. My options give enough of a buffer that I can take a significant dip without losing any money. 
2. I won't be getting too many orders at the start, that'd I'd invest the effort into this site and then run.
3. If it grows, I'll secure more options contracts to properly hedge my risk. Actually, I hope to find a group of people to trade options with and perhaps develop an options market. Bitcoin really needs one. 
4. I will place orders with DX as I get them, so on the event there is a catastrophic crash, you order would already be in route.

And that's perfectly fine. I don't see how that is an argument against free market. I'll just have to suck it up and drive on dirt. Compared to the current system, the government would take everyone else's money, and build a road that only I use.

In a closed economy, exchange rate doesn't matter. Do you ever think about exchange rate of usd vs hundreds of other currencies? No because they don't affect you. If usd vs jpy rate went up, you wouldn't describe that as positive. So why do you care about this rate? Because everything is still priced as usd in our heads. Someday we will price things in btc and this exchange rate won't matter. Fact of the matter is, most of us are hoarding speculators, you included. There's nothing wrong with that, as long as some hoarders decide to open shops so they can charge more coins. The hoard-ablilty of btc is a design feature. If you don't like hoarding, there is a fork that is an inflationary crypto currency. (can't recall the name ATM)

I consider "math-based" either inexpressive or redundant. It's redundant in that everything is math based, including USD. Economics, computer science, and other fields of science all rely on math. It's inexpressive in that there's very little math actual involved or at least not that complicated. 
"Cryptographic" is far more descriptive. If it must be dumb'ed down, "digital" is sufficient. Open source and peer-to-peer are always what I include in my elevator pitch as they are both factual and nice sounding.

You guys are a step in the right direction, but I have several questions as I'm a bit skeptical. I didn't see the initial launch until the aftermath, so maybe that would have answered a few questions. As I'm running a similar (albeit less breadth and popular)  service, I've thought about the challenges you'd be facing.
1. What is your BTC/USD exchange rate equation? Last price? Daily average?
2. And along the same lines, how do you quote the prices from of any random website? Do customers get invoices instantly?
3. As the bitcoin market is bullish, have you guys considered buying/selling options in-order to hedge against bitcoin movement? I believe this is a method a large company with dedicated services can provide services for LESS than amazon what you guys would be paying. I propose this to be a viable business strategy as long as bitcoin prices continue to rise (on average), you hedge properly, and you don't take more than you can swallow. 
4. I believe amazon (and probably other sites) tries to ban drop-shippers. Is this why you're doing this re-shipping service? If not, how do you plan to deal with problems such as amazon banning your account? 
5. I don't see how (or for what purpose) a customer's shipping info can be stored offline. You need a server to host your site and accept shipping information. I'd imagine it would then encrypt that information, send it to your office computer (which is still online), and you guys manually fulfill each request. Suppose you then move all that info onto a hard-disk daily. That seems like it would be less secure than having a well secured online storage; there are more points of venerability. This is something I've questioned every time someone promotes offline storage (usually of bitcoins). It's especially weird to me in your case, because you emphasizing on the security of shipping addresses, which are probably less desirable hacking target than a server with a wallet.dat file.
It's great that you guys are providing such a service, and with so much the support of users here. I really do hope you guys succeed. But having thought long and hard about these questions myself, I don't believe it will be easy and until those questions can be answered, I'll be skeptical.

Maybe I am being cryptic. I agree that merchants are most important. I am a merchant myself. All I'm saying is, most merchandise/service is more expensive to buy when comparing purchase method 4 and 1. 
Example 1: reddit gold cost the same in btc and usd. If I buy it with btc and then replace the btc using fiat, I'd have to transfer 3.99 into dwolla, then into gox, and then buy back btc at 0.6% fee. By then, my 3.99 usd only buys 80% of the btc I originally spent. I can of course plan ahead 3 days, and buy reddit gold after I bought btc. But why would I do that when I can bypass all this by paying with cc?
I'm not arguing to hoard or to spend. I'm arguing that 4 is a **terrible** replacement for 1 in current market conditions. How can that be improved? Since reddit no longer have to deal with cc fees and chargebacks, they save ~5% by accepting btc. They can now charge 3.79 instead to btc users, incentivizing us to use option 3. That is how merchants will start to accept btc, not by users paying them a premium on btc. 
The long term goal is that everyone switches to btc and no fiat. To get there, we should do it now. That means when you want to cash out, consider spending the btc on something instead. And the merchant that took it, instead of using bitpay to turn it into usd right away, hold on to it. Maybe use it on namecheap next time the domain named needs to be updated.

1. I'm not saying that paying gavin is a bad thing, but they advertise themselves as some sort of non-profit for the greater good of bitcoin. They have their private interests in mind, and that's fine, but don't fraudulently collect donations to support own agendas. 
2. It may be modeled after linux found, but there are huge differences.
The linux foundation has much more expenses (bitcoin foundation has 10k's of bitcoins, and I'm (not sure) guessing the companies do not have much direct influence in it (btcfound directly involve themselves in influencing how to prioritize code upgrades). Also, the satoshi of linux (Linus Torvalds) actually heads that foundation i believe.

**Regarding the "weekend dip" myth:**


This is actually somewhat of a myth propagated though this community. I've done some back-testing of strategies that sell and buy 1btc over the weekend, and none proves to be reliably profitable during the last 6 months. There's somewhat of a trend of prices being more stable over the weekends, as the banking freeze over weekends is a legitimate reason for less volume. 


That's actually a very illogical strategy for a day trader to perpetuate. I'd dump on Thursday if I knew prices would fall on Friday. Then a smarter guy would dump on Wednesday, etc... 


So are weekday dips. There was a 15% dip on the 19th. 
My point with all this is that these statements are all speculation. I have personally been annoyed with the number of people here that propagate speculatory claims that are voiced here matter-of-factly without siting sources. If I were a mod, I'd be more careful with PSAs that propagate these myths.
Now with all that said. **Every other advice ThePiachu gave are sound.** Trading during the flash crashes are definitely profitable (if you can see them coming) but stressful. The most enjoyable time I've had with my investment wallet is when I just left it alone and took note of weekly price increases. 
My added advice to other newbies is: 
1. Buy in now and consider it a write-off. Don't touch it for a year. 
2. During that year, pay attention to bitcoin news. Differentiate opinions from facts. Take opinions with a grain of salt. 
3. DO consider how you can make ~~money~~ BTC! When you contribute to the bitcoin economy with solid businesses, you'll earn BTC, and help propel BTC to wider-spread adoption, securing the value of your wallet. 
**My speculation regarding recent flash-crashes**
There are two things a whale would do (depending on his financial goals) in response to recent FinCEN documents and MtGox+CoinLab partnership:
1. Dump x amount now, to possibly avoid taxes once regulation have grip with CoinLab, or the volatility that will come of the transition. 
2. Hide the rest of bitcoins in offline storage. 
I'd say the recent crash that happened in 3 min was due to

To a certain degree, I agree. However, Bitcoin to me promotes personal responsibility (and the societal benefit it brings). CC provides fraud protection, which puts the burden of my personal responsibility of protecting my money to merchants. That in turn drives up prices, which discourages those practicing personal responsibility from doing so. The game theoretical conclusion to that is then everyone becomes completely irresponsible, fraud rampant, and prices sky high.

Why would there be more people in violence market? 
Typical an-cap believes the opposite would happen. A soldier in front line of battle gets paid the same as the guy in the back. In a free market, he would be paid at least 2x. That's 2x less fighters we can afford.
And according to [this]( Iraq War costs us $6T. California spent [~$10B incarcerating people]( Then you have cops who hide just to trap people for speeding.
Who in a free market would pay for these things?
The argument against unreasonable road tolls is that I don't have to pay. The owner would have to hire security to enforce the toll, which is not profitable.

So true. People confuse ripple with XRP. The concept of ripple is not a scam, and in fact the ONLY real solution to a decentralized exchange I've seen. XRP is a scam in the sense that the company wants to ingrain itself as a vital part of the trust network.

Quite the opposite in fact. If fiat currency collapsed tomorrow, people would have to resort to an alternative currency or barter within local communities. 
If society didn't collapse with it, then the only thing that can replace fiat is crypto-currencies. Gold and silver wouldn't be good replacements for our modern lifestyles. This is the long term future I envision for bitcoin. After 100 years, I can imagine the value of gold would even go down, as its store of value property replaced by a superior store of value.

ITT: No one who actually watched that.
What happened was someone with over 1M in capital decided to push the price up from $90 to $93. He then made buy/sell walls on both sides to pinch the price within $0.00001 constantly. Notice that there are still trades by the volume bars at bottom, but the price doesn't change, because no one can take down the walls he built.

I believe their address is public, so that a quick search can produce an estimate of their monthly rent. They have roughly 20 employees, server cost, legal fees, etc. So it's most likely that they burned through the 8 mils profit they've eaned this year. 
Based on my past convos with magical tux, all the money they've made before that probably pales in comparison to that 8 mil. With massive withdraws after dwolla, I'd say that they are likely insolvent.

It actually simplifies the loan process. Currently, loans would need to predict inflation, which may be complicated. With a deflationary currency, one should be satisfied with simply getting just a little extra back. Whether -2% or -3% deflation might not actually matter. 
The premium then would only be a factor of risk of default of the borrower + some arbitrary premium.

Yes fiat encourages investing in these services that are sold by financial institutions. However, those are not truely "investments." The money you pay do not actually go to the businesses you buy the stock of. That money was given to them during their IPO and previous funding rounds. Real economic growth occurs when companies produce valuable products and services that customers are willing to pay for. Real investments are then funding that helps the business grow. The investments you speak of are essentially forced upon you by inflation. 
So deflationary currency such as Bitcoin makes clear to us to invest only in things that have *real* value. I have been selling coins for the past few months to fund a project, consciously knowing that if I just sat on the coins instead, it'd be worth a lot more a few years from now. If the opportunity to produce real value wasn't there, I wouldn't have sold. I'd certainly wouldn't sell BTC to invest in something like a mutual fund.

The kingdom of Qin ended up conquering all of China to become the first [dynasty]( The emperor became paranoid over assassinations upon his life, built the Great Wall at cost of many lives, and was unable to manage the empire. Qin  Dynasty fell after only 15 years.

This is one of the best concise, understandable, and comprehensive descriptions of bitcoin I've seen in 2 years. And excerpt for the technical details. There is more but I will respect their rights. 
**Bitcoin Technical Explanation**
For the unique signature Bitcoin uses the same technique used by banks, credit cards, etc - public/private key digital signatures. This was introduced by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman in 1977 [formally RSA, acquired in 2006 by EMC (EMC)]. The public &amp; private keys are chosen such that 1) encryptions using the public key can only be decrypted by the private key and 2) it's computational intractable to determine one from the other (it would take longer than the lifetime of the universe to crack the private key). Conveniently, doing the reverse - 'encrypting' with the private key, 'decrypting' with the public key - forms a unique signature: if the verification comes out as expected, then only the corresponding private key could have made the signature. This ensures that payments are coming from the right entity. In the case of Bitcoin, the public keys themselves become the identifiers of the paying and receiving "wallets", and knowing the private key represents ownership of that wallet.
The standard solution to the double spending problem - ensuring I don't spend more money than I have - is to use a special trusted entity. The trusted entity looks at all transactions and makes sure none are repeated. Some protocols use a government entity; mobile protocols typically use the network operator; the phone-to-phone prototype I worked on used a bank as the trusted entity. Bitcoin on the other hand does not use one entity checking for double spends. Instead, Bitcoin uses the whole community to do checking. Making this community checking work is the technical innovation of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin spenders announce all their transactions to the Bitcoin network. These are picked up by anyone which wishes to participate in verifying Bitcoin transactions - these are called 'miners'. Each miner takes each announced transaction and checks that it both, has right signature and data entries, and has not been seen before (ensuring this is a first-spend); if both pass the transaction is added into the newest 'block' of data. The miner then hashes the block. The one-way hash function is a mathematic function [y = hash(x)], with the special properties that 1) it is easy to compute y given x, but impossible to compute x from y and 2) small changes in x create big and random changes in y. So it is very easy to check that we agree on the outcome of the hash of a particular block, but it is very hard to get a particular hash value. In the Bitcoin protocol, the miners must get a hash for the block below a specified target value; if they don't, they add a random number - called a nonce - to the end of the block and try again. The miners will try billions of possible nonces before they successfully 'mine' the block. As a reward for the verification work, the winning miner gets to include a small transaction to himself - this is the source of the money supply. The new block is announced to all the other miners, who then verify the block and if it follows the rules, the miners all start on the next block. If the other miners think something is wrong, if they think someone is trying to cheat, they will reject the proposed block and continue to mine it for themselves. Each block also has a reference to the previous block, so every accepted block is an acceptance of the entire history of bitcoin transfers.

Great question. The percentages can be adjusted based on demand of either types of orders. If there are too many Spend orders, we can simply lower the discount along with the Buyer fee to move them faster. Ideally, we'll find a sweet spot such that orders are on the books for less than 12 hours but there will always be orders available. 
From what I often hear, the process of buying bitcoins are often too difficult for new users. 6% on a $100 is only $6, and it's comparable to what bitinstant charged for orders up to $500. For buying in the US, a new user would spend over a week at Coinbase or take a risk on Localbitcoin (both great companies), and many would rather reduce the hassle. This is our target demographic. 
As for Spenders, we want to heavily incentive them filling up the orderbooks to offer wide selection to Buyers. 5% seemed like a unbeatable deal :)

The only solid information you'd be able to get is its current balance at any given time. Total past transactions can be obscured by cycling the same funds between the publicly known address and some sort of mixer.

Bitcoin isn't something that should or can be advertised. It's like advertising gold. People that it's valuable through our culture. We already promote that. 
Now promoting might be worthwhile, but honestly, I think the best thing would be to tip (with the bot) people in other subreddits to spread the culture. People respond to money, even if it's a few bitcents. A visible tip to a top comment will generate much more interest than any traditional advertising. The cashing in karma feature would also get high profile redditors interested.

The recent media crazy was probably made easier due to the new bitcoin.org website. 
The bitcoin.org should go back to it's original form. Bitcoin is an open source software project and the site should reflect no more than that. There should be developers, code, and some associated literature. It's basically turning into a government entity that's giving handouts to their friends. Now if media decides to contact devs and ask about businesses, they can do that. But bitcoin.org should be focused only on the core code.

I am kind of a hardware guy although only a small part of the whole process. 
I do know that if you had a billion dollar, you can buy a small fab, but certainly not enough to have the expertise on site to make top of the line chips. The companies who can produce top of the line in volume can be counted in 1 hand (intel, samsung, tsmc, globalfoundries, and at most 1 other). The companies that create the tools can be counted in two.
The only redeeming factor is that the technology is relatively spread out between US, Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, and soon UAE. They'd all have to work together to rig the chips or the honest one would get all the business.
The counter measures are either get ready for a hard fork or have bitcoin grow faster than the cooperation can solidify. The latter option is not impossible as adoption is exponential. 
Edit: The quoted argument presented by who I assume to be John Dillon is actually a reasonable one. Hardware manipulation indeed presents a great risk for bitcoin, so CoinValidation may indeed be martyrs buying us time as a pointless distraction for the USG to control bitcoin (the irony). However, the cryptocurrency cat is out of the bag and a slow destruction of bitcoin may not be a long term solution for USG. As it becomes clear that the integrity of bitcoin is compromised, altcoins will gain traction and become the next thing. By this time, it'll be clear that cryptocurrencies are *it,* countries would invest hundreds billions into IC manufacturing to vie for control, and much more people will use it and accept its values. Jumping to 10 new altcoins will occur far faster than bitcoin adoption. Knowing this, hopefully the USG won't bother trying. This is of course all speculation.

Ripple the monetary system is a concept or implementation that tries to allow users to quantify trust in other. In real life, you trust your friend for $10, and he might trust his other friend for $20. On ripple, he can effectively borrow $10 from you through this trust network. How the effect propagates based on adoption can obviously lead to immense implications.

Few comments from an ethnically Chinese American that spent a few years there:
1. Chinese tend to practical. They generally won't use morality as a tool to guide opinion and actions. There are negative consequences, but it tends to be more objective. 
1. Example of negative consequence is government corruption. However, capital controls do not benefit the elite either, and bitcoin actually opens an avenue of financial freedom for them as well. 
1. News tend to be very objective compared to the US.
The combination of these and the fact they are real competition to the US will make it an interesting dynamic for bitcoiners in the upcoming years.

Your concerns are valid. A lot of replies here are in fact evangelical and uneconomic.

All the returns/refunds can be handled solely by the spender very easily with the Amazon Order ID or just shipping address. Amazon will be able to look up the order. If the spender opts for a refund, a gift card balance will be applied to his account. However this only applies to Amazon fulfilled items.
