Dude, don’t be worried about that. That’s going to happen. The conflict needs to play out, and some don’t have the stomach for it. When the price goes down, fine. Just buy more because this thing is too brilliant to fail completely, and all it has to do is survive to eventually take over.

Because this is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch; the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker, and this is my ski mask.

But I’m not arguing there is no risk. There is always risk. My savings was in an online account. Aren’t there risks associated with keeping Fiat-based assets sitting in a Chase account? What is the difference between the 2 sets of risks over 5 yrs let’s say?

Lol, fair enough, but before you beat yourself off to your own boundless wisdom you need to look into diffusion of innovations theory. Just because people are aware of something doesn’t mean they understand the value of it. It takes time to cross the chasm from early adopter to mass market. But when that happens, things will skyrocket quickly. 
You have the curse of knowledge and so you are doubting the quality of the BTC solution just because of the behavior of the masses. It’s a safe way to live, I’ll give you that, but I’ve seen a lot of ideas and this one is near irrefutable. 
The masses will all eventually fall in line, and the ones who had vision will profit.

I survived my first correction. 
I had put all my savings into bitcoin during the last bottom, and even though I fully believe in the technology and claimed I would always hodl, I was sweating bullets as I saw my first negative valuation. Then within a day later, everything turned around. Fast forward to now and I am once again $1000+ in the black. 
I didn’t sell. I was so close. Got it all ready to dump below $10,000. But I just couldn’t do it. I said F it, I’m staying. 
Feels good man.

ITT people who think OP said “intelligent bankers” instead of “intelligent people.” 
History’s biggest disasters happened because the people at the bottom were marginalized and silenced. 
Bitcoin is the opposite of that, and as long as the internet is alive, it can not be stopped by the smaller number of privileged elite.

I still don’t know ALL the details. I’ve been reading about mining and halving and wallets and such, but nothing I’m seeing has made me regret my instinctive move.
I was initially concerned to read about all the manipulation, but when you think about what bitcoin is and what humanity is, it should not surprise or concern you. And it’s way better than the manipulation going on in the hands of human judgement. 
The strength of bitcoin is in the quality of the idea and the fact that it has already enough of a following not to die as long as the internet is around. I’m in. Long term.

Get a Ledger Nano S (a “hardware wallet”) with your next $60, then keep porting your bitcoin over into Coinbase Pro and then your Nano. This saves you transfer fees and keeps your bitcoin holdings safe. Hodl your bitcoin in your wallet.

Not reckless to invest in brilliance. You are just not used to seeing the exponential results of true team collaboration. 
It’s not magic, but it’s rare, and somehow we’ve been able to get this idea up and running despite  being in the poisoned pool of crony capitalism for so long. 
This is a beautiful solution, and it’s now conceptually unstoppable. I’m INNN like a Winkleboss.

“Governments will not allow it?” What a scary notion that people like OP think governments can and routinely manipulate what people choose to value. 
Shouldn’t it be the other way around? With governments protecting the right of the people to choose what to value?
