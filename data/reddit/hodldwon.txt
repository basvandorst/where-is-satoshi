Yes... [The Blockchain]( that is being [forked by IBM, UBS, CIBC, etc.]( and also the same one [R3CEV]( is interested in. Anyways, regardless of the private chains [The Blockchain will handle IoT]( [store of value]( etc...
[The Blockchain]( that [Don Tapscott]( was talking about **will** decentralizes all the things ;-)

Ya, I didn't know about the password feature before I owned one (it was a present from my wife). Basically you have your seed words (12, 18 or 24 words) but wait... THERE'S MORE!
Whatever passphrase you enter each time you plug in the Trezor makes a different HD wallet!
So your seed might be "Book, Rainbow, Slug, ..." and that never needs to change, but then when you use it type "Password1" for an HD wallet and with the same seed, use "Password2" for a second entirely separate HD wallet!
Have as many wallets as you do passphrases without resetting your seed!

To clarify further: They forked so they could be ready for the demo linked above (the washing machine and TV ads).
Long term they are implementing EthereumJ (Java) for Android devices and releasing it as OpenSource back to the Ethereum community. So... "Yes" IBM will be on the public Ethereum blockchain and not their own proprietary IoT chain.

Ethereum is actually building it into dogecoin first. Their Devs were super excited about the idea.
Edit: Oh and RBF wouldn't work on Ethereum. The way BTC would be represented on the Ethereum network is as a subtoken that was verified by an SPV contract. Let's call the subcoin BTC^(E). Therefore all transactions involving BTC^(E) are validated by Ethereum Stakers, not BTC Miners.

[Where is your god now](
@_date: 2016-01-27 16:29:43
There was a crowdsale that lasted 42 days... where the exchange rate was 1 btc =&gt; 2000 ether fir the first 7 days. Then it dropped linearly to 1btc =&gt; 1337 ether until the 42 days were up.
Then we waited through all the proof of concept chains and test nets for nearly a year our funds were locked up with no guarantee any of it would work. I call that an investment... not a pre-mine.
There was also an unofficial EtherCoin that allowed trades during that wait period. None of us knew if EtherCoin was a scam, but in the end it turned out people were able to redeem EtherCoin for real Ether... we still don't know who ran EtherCoin.
When the real Ether finally hit a few exchanges the price tanked because volumes were super thin mnany people from the crowdsale wanted to lock in profits we bought about 1 eth for 33 cents) and ether stabilized around $1 USD through much of Frontier release.
Now it's today... I still have 6100 ETHER (6K presale, 100 purchased).
Once again, google is your friend... you can find the truth for yourself.

Btc holders don't want to believe it, but Ethereum is an order of magnitude ahead in the tech. That's not to say Ethereum can't fail, but it won't be from competition.
Regardless of the spammer's intentions anyone with even moderate google-fu can see through the FUDders and trolls. Ethereum stands on it's own merrits, which is why it's rising now and over $10MM moved into it in 24hrs the other day.
But honestly, ignoring market caps... as they are nearly meaningless. Pay attention to the fundamentals.
 - Huge number of Developers
 - [DevCon1]( was an amazing success
 - r/Ethereum and r/EthTrader very friendly subs
 - Ethereum.StackExchange site in private beta stage, should go public in February (has excellent question quality)
 - u/The_Daily_Decrypt just [interviewed Ethereum Dev Taylor Gerring](
 - Shibes wuv us and we love them too ;-)
 - hell, even the [CEO of Bitcoin]( likes us
 - IBM Made a washing machine
 - Microsoft Azure hosting Ethereum based private chains (mostly for testing) via Consensys integration
 - [R3CEV (40+ banks testing Ethereum)](
Infrastructure / dApps:
 - Oraclize.it
 - AlarmClock
 - Digix Gold
 - Maker / DAI (StableCoin)
 - [DogeRelay Bounty Contract]( (Two-way pegg / sidechains PoC)
 - Auger / Groupnosis (prediction markets)
 - EtherEx (Distributed Exchange)
 - Provenance (supply chain traching)
 - Slock.it makes smart locks
 - [Consensys (tool builders, Dev community, evangelists)](
 - EthCore (tool builders / Consulting firm)
 - ~17s block times (will be 5s after Serenity update)
 - ASIC resistant GPU Mining algorithm [Ethash](
 - issuance 5 Ether per block, ~4 for first uncle/orphan block, ~3 next orphan (orphans add to security instead of being wasted)
 - [Dynamic Blocksize Algorithm (gas limit)](
 - [Understanding Serenity, Part I: Abstraction](
 - [Understanding Serenity, Part 2: Casper](
 - curently top load has hit about 20 tps, but a naive Sharding implementation should get us to 10k tps ( Serenity), more research looks to be able to get us to 100k tps (a few years out)
So... the only risks I see are problems with PoS not being technically or economically viable (low risk, but non-zero). Or a breakdown of governance like in Bitcoin.
Some of us are advocating a certain amount of inflation be sent to a [Futarchy]( contract that can forward funds to Common Goods, maybe the Ethereum Foundation or just burn it to negate the inflation.
We *are* what Bitcoin was *supposed* to be... the one chain to rule them all...

There is no adapter that could possibly be written on the ethereum side to make a two-way peg work... otherwise it would mean we could inject arbitrary code into the bitcoin chain and that my friend would be the Grand Canyon of security holes.
Pegging by it's very definition is opt-in. Ethereum has a scripting language powerful enough that it has opted-in already for every chain that exists now and into the future (hence turing complete catch-phrases). Anything that can be programmed, ever, can be stuffed into an ethereum contract... it just might not be cost effective...
Bitcoin on the other hand has an intentionally crippled scripting language, because Satoshi thought it was a security vulnerability. Ethereum significantly reduces the attack surface by running contracts in a Virtual Machine ratheer than natively like Bitcoin. And second the Gas mechanism means we are priced by computation, so an infinite loop costs infinite Gas... and you have to pre-pay before the Miner runs your contract code.
So... you misunderstand.... Bitcoin must add the appropriate Op Codes to allow the 2-way peg. Ethereum can only do a 1-way peg by validating proof of burn until then.

not really... 200K is at or above the top end wage, unless you manage a large team at which point you're more of a manager than a programmer.  I would have expected 125-150K for a senior developer, prior to seeing this return statement.

I don't understand why so many are concerned about a ~$120 device to secure their coins. It's a one-time fixed cost.

Ethereum was on proof of concept 5 at the time and Swarm was dropped from the initial development plan as many other teams including IPFS, StorJ and MaidSafe were already working on this problem. That said I don't believe Storj had any publicly working code when IBM forked Ethereum so they went with bit torrent because it was a functional and well tested protocol that their devs were already familiar with.

@_date: 2016-05-19 04:33:06
Sharding and Asynchronous transactions:
Also with Proof of Stake even full-nodes will be able to drop the chain after the oldest validator block. Archive nodes would then be the only ones interested in the full history for historical purposes (not security). And Swarm/IPFS may end up acting as a distributed host for the archived chain anyways so won't be overly duplicated (perhaps dozens of redundant coppies, not thousands).
Did I mention Ethereum's node count exceeds Bitcoin's now? Since last week... just throwing that out there...

Vault of Satoshi (which is closed now) had cryptographic proof of solvency... Basically anytime I wanted, I could view their Cold Wallet (~4000 coins) and I could prove through the merkle tree that they actually held the X number of coins I had with them.
Only shitty thing was they had terrible volume... I really loved VoS' policies/tech... to bad they couldn't make any money at it.

Food for thought, that Bitcoin is like land ownership.




Andreas Antonopoulos has said much the same about replacing Bitcoin with something else if it gets co-opted/corrupted or too powerful.  Cryptocurrency is about people and how we manage value creation/distribution fairly. If you are so bent on Bitcoin being the only solution, then you are missing the point of the revolution in the first place. You'll be left holding the bag while everyone else moves on...

Ethereum is for smart-contracts and a generalized platform for building DApps (distributed applications). If you're a bit technical, see the following (theorized) application-stack which includes Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains among others: 
It is vastly more likely that Ethereum and Bitcoin will complement each other. One is unlikely to dominate over the other, as they are good for different things.
