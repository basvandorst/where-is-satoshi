there are lots of different methods of FOREX hedging, I would start here if interested: 
@_date: 2016-06-26 22:10:57
why would you think Gemini would?
@_date: 2016-06-26 22:10:32
but their influence in the BTC market would be hugely important, compared to say, Zimbabwe

Keynes almost got his world currency during the Bretton Woods Convention.  Wanted to call it the "Bancor" of which he would likely be the governor of.  Settled/bamboozled into a Gold back USD for global reserve currency

I agree, as an amateur economist, Ver's reasoning is murky.
@_date: 2016-06-25 15:28:12
crazy to watch, how much China dominates...What I can't understand is why Zimbabwe, South Africa, Venezuela and other struggling currencies aren't piling in to BTC as fast as they can?!?!

I think it had very little do do with either, more to do with short term disruption in market equilibrium fundementals. 
@_date: 2016-06-25 22:44:57
I agree.  supply constraints on a commodity are a major explanatory variable of prices.  but i would ask yourself this question: "why did I get motivated enough to ask this in a reddit forum? and do i believe that this motivating factor will also encourage many others to make decisions just as I have?"
@_date: 2016-06-25 16:26:23
but is it not an aggregation of all exchange volume?
@_date: 2016-06-26 03:03:33
If you are thinking short term then yes, long term this is a good indication that it is even considered.
@_date: 2016-06-25 05:04:01
did you attach a miners' fee?  The blocks may be pretty full these days and without a fee it may be that no pool will pick it up.  Also, Kraken requires like 6 confirmations, which can take some time.

I think ur assessment of the mid-June rise was incorrect, not directly influenced by "leave" in the polls.
previous highs were speculative.  Price dipped due to Aussie Auction.  See post: 
Price bounce back to $660 was a return to market equilibrium.  Price of $690 might be a bump caused by increase demand from Brexit.
@_date: 2016-06-26 20:48:26
supply side is an important determinant of commodity equilibrium markets, however, the marginal addition of mined BTC is increasing less...at roughly 4% supply increase for a number of years, compared to 8% for the past few years.
This means that the same change in marginal demand would have a larger impact for the following years.  However, as most of the market knows this, the price is probably already baked in to the current price.  Although, market is still fairly immature with limited liquidity so the perfect market principle does not really apply to BTC.

wow, that was hard to watch, so much confusion on his part.  Why doesn't he just say, "I have no idea what Bitcoin is."  Hey would have saved what last bit of credibility he has left...
@_date: 2016-06-26 17:10:49
I agree, that's where he lost me.  Bitcoin is being modified into a better "steam compressor"

dude, it was a metaphor for moore's law, technological problem solving and capacity of human innovation...u might wanna unplug for a while...
@_date: 2016-06-25 17:46:38
good insight, thanks for your reply
@_date: 2016-06-25 19:42:39
thanks for another data point
@_date: 2016-06-26 17:11:25
why no edit?
@_date: 2016-06-25 22:47:45
I disagree.  The price may already be a reflection of both those things: 4% annual increase in supply and calculation of growth in demand.
Granted this is similar to a "perfect market" interpretation of price, which may have little baring on an immature market such as BTC

Does the future hold NGOs and other ORGs firing up mining rigs in order to counteract monopoly, oligopoly voting power?
@_date: 2016-06-25 04:39:46
How this got passed the author is baffling.  Fiat is the definition of an invented currency, only it is backed by a monopoly on violence.  Wasn't the secret service first used to ensure US citizens were spending it and not private bank notes?  That is a blatant invention and coercion to create value.
@_date: 2016-06-26 22:31:58
not exceptionally insightful
@_date: 2016-06-25 16:02:13
plus, it is illegal to use gold as currency, at least in the US
@_date: 2016-06-25 17:26:03
i haven't noticed any volume going to Britain.  Any sources out there with numbers?
@_date: 2016-06-30 15:15:47
is this a joke?
@_date: 2016-06-25 04:53:34
I don't think it should matter...the BTC were bought by firms who would have had to purchase from exchanges otherwise.  No need to be bought on a "market exchange" or a "off-market exchange," the real impact of extra BTC in grey market activity would be identical.
@_date: 2016-07-11 20:52:06
bitcoin does not behave according to Chart-onomics theory.
@_date: 2016-07-01 23:02:32
No idea, I am not invited to those.  But I am pretty sure traders at Goldman or JP Morgan aren't on Btstamp
@_date: 2016-07-01 22:08:35
I disagree.  There are magic OTC markets.
@_date: 2016-07-28 03:25:45
In what world do wire transfers take 5 days?  Most are done in less than 24 hours.  I am all for bitcoin, but not exaggerating to promote a core use case that is already widely accepted.
@_date: 2016-07-23 17:41:00
maybe, but the market cap of BTC is so small that any institution could out leverage market volume
@_date: 2016-07-01 00:24:06
I wish more citizens had a PhD in econ, would make the BS crony market regulatory process more difficult to achieve
@_date: 2016-07-09 06:16:07
Closest thing I can see to set your alarm to
@_date: 2016-07-01 20:41:43
if a big player wanted to buy a large sum of BTC, say $50 million (which is a small position for institutional investors) since the market is so light on liquidity, they could put a $2 million short to lower the price, and then do the transaction OTC at the lower price.  That would be manipulation, not to mention front-running
@_date: 2016-07-25 03:11:39
I had the same analysis, only more broad scale
