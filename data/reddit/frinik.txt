Probably a good idea get a friend to go to these exchanges with you for security purposes pending on size of transactions.  Theres a lot of sketchy people out there.

I second coinjar, though their rules for new accounts are pretty stupid imo.
Send scanned documents for verification.  Takes around a week for this.
Once verified u get $500 cash wire transfer limit per day for a week.
Then thats raised to 1k and u get an additional 100 added to that per deposit.
Seriously why complicate things so much?
By the time you have built up a decent wire transfer limit you would have been better off using a cash deposit service.

Its a shame the transaction wasn't done in bitcoin.
Heres an extract from new scientist article: 
...Now the block chain is being applied beyond the movement of money using a technique called "colouring" bitcoins. It has the potential to transform commerce. Take the buying and selling of real estate, for example. In a statement before the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs on 19 November, Anthony Gallippi, CEO of Bitcoin payment firm BitPay, described how co-opting the block chain could do away with the gaggle of fees and legal manoeuvrings that usually accompany home sales.
"The biggest up­front costs for consumers trying to buy a home are the closing costs, which include fees for deeds, titles, stamps, title insurance, and other redundant tasks to record the sale in different record books," Gallippi said. "Bitcoin can replace thousands of dollars in closing costs with a single transaction that costs 5 cents. By reporting deeds and titles on the block chain, the information would be public record forever, for pennies, and eliminate the need for title insurance."

The Department of Justice (DOJ) warned about how the Bitcoin enables money laundering, illicit tax shelters, and anonymous purchasers of illegal drugs, child pornography, and stolen credit card information. Said Mythili Raman, a DOJ assistant attorney general, the growth in the use of the Bitcoin “inevitably will be accompanied by an increase in illicit transactions
....because you cant do that with USD already?

Many thanks kind sir.  Thats all I wanted to know.
I'd stop harassing them if they'd just communicate.  4 words would have worked.  'we're low be patient'
Kinda bad that I had to find out from a stranger.
