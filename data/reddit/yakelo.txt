You would probably have to contact exchanges directly for over the counter trades at a fixed price. Buying on the standard markets would be very difficult without increasing the price a significant amount

"Out of thin air" -
this was a Bitcoin Cash FUD campaign against Bitfinex, when Bitfinex referred to Bitcoin Cash as BCASH.
The increase in Tether printing is more likely due to people depositing money to buy the dip.

Exchanges will always be the targets of hackers.
Its the exchange's job to make sure their platform is secure and unfortunately there's nothing a user can do in regards to 2FA, secure passwords, etc. to protect their balance if the exchange itself gets hacked.
The best thing you can do is only store coins in exchanges when you're trading then remove them once your done. It might cost you a bit in fee's to send to/from but it will cost you far more if you lose all of your coins to to a hacked exchange.

No. generating a key pair is easy. The chances of generating a keypair that somebody else has already generated is pretty much impossible with todays technology.
If you had even a tiny fraction of the power required to generate an already use private/public key pair in 1000 years - you'd be better off just mining them.

@_date: 2018-01-22 14:24:42
I hope you are right!
There's definitely a drop in both volume and transactions though. And the current drop is certainly just a case of nobody buying, not irational panic selling like we see on most big drops.
That being said, bitcoin trends changes weekly/monthly. So while we're currently projected to keep going lower, in crypto its usually best to expect the unexpected hahaha.

Coinmarketcap probably didn't know the circulating supply at the time so just left it at 0
Then they "found out" and set it so market cap went up to 10mill 
then they removed it (probably decided the number was wrong)
then they set it to a different value causing market cap to go up to 400mill
market cap changes if supply or price per coin changes.
Coinmarketcap use the "circulating supply" not the "total supply" so they constantly change it if more coins are released into circulation

This sounds like more of a psychological issue rather than a financial issue. Stop looking at the unit "Bitcoin" - you say "a single Bitcoin" like its a small thing.
Very few people are able to own a Bitcoin and there will be even less if Bitcoin reaches where it wants to be.
OP this a problem we see a lot. Too many people counting in BTC and not mBTC. A Bitcoin is divisble down to 8 decimal places and has a fixed supply of 21 million. It was never intended to be held by the whole number in the future.
According to Wikipedia: 


Imagine an individual gold investor saying "Oh I can't afford this, I'll never own a single gold bar"
Invest what you can afford to lose and be proud of your investment - instead of looking at the LARGEST possible unit and thinking "I'll never have one of those"

@_date: 2018-01-30 23:57:42
Not at all.
The 170 billion market cap you see is based on *last agreed trade multiplied by the total supply*. Market cap has no real bearing on what all Bitcoins are worth..
If you had 2billion dollars right now and wanted to put it into Bitcoin you would increase the market cap by **significantly** more than $2 billion. like a lot more.
Equally, if it comes to light that $2 billion worth of money inserted into Bitcoin was non-existent, expect the market cap to drop **significantly** more than $2billion. Then factor in the loss of market confidence and yeah, we're looking at an 80% drop. 
You can not increase the value of a market with artificial money then remove that money and assume things will just stay as they are.


Personally, after finding out the subpoena was back in December and they never stepped in and shut them down, Im pretty confident the money is there. I don't *like* the tether system because its stupid and it's one group of people earning interest on our money, but knowing the money there is better than finding out the entire crypto market was the victim to a $2 billion scam.

The first time Mt. Gox got hacked and somebody dumped the price from $17 all the way down to 0.
I decided to look up what Bitcoin was at the time and seen they'd bounced back up to $17 - decided not to buy because the price seemed high at the time.
Not really any regrets though, I was unemployed and had no spare cash at the time.
Wasn't until the 2013 boom when I started buying.

A short position means they've already sold BTC they don't actually have and are waiting to buy lower (think of it as borrowing bitcoin because they're confident it'll go down).
Because it went up instead of down like they bet it would, their broker has basically just noped out and liquidated them so they had to buy back the bitcoin at a higher price to pay back that loan.

Bitcoin is traded on exchanges, so 'price' basically just means 'last agreed trade'.
Its like gig tickets, when there are only a few people selling and a lot of people want them, they start offering more and more. As demand for bitcoin increases, people will want more for them and people will offer more for them. as supply reduces and/or demand increases, the price people are willing to pay will be increased.

Ethereum isn't really a currency, its a token used on a smart contract platform. A lot of people here and there (i.e the Ethereum community) see it as "us and them". (moonboys who don't like the idea of it taking some of Bitcoin's inflow of buyers)
In reality with the introduction of decentralised oracles, Bitcoin and Ethereum will be able to work together. Its possible that the Ether token itself will be hidden away and most Ethereum transactions are initially funded by Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-28 14:51:36
Adoption and it's name. Every other coin was in some way created from Bitcoin - whether it was written from scratch or a fork of an existing coin, the idea came from Bitcoin and Bitcoin will always be seen as the "original" coin. On a technical level, every other coin is either equal or better than Bitcoin. Some of the other coins have incredible innovations.
But.. at the rate technology moves these days and how quickly changing the crypto space is, theres no point in everyone migrating to the newer/fancier coin because in 6 months time another coin will come along better than that.
Bitcoin has it's flaws but its proven itself over nearly 9 years and in most of the first world its now a recognised name. We shouldn't be looking for new coins to move to, we need a solution to upgrade this existing block chain to make it more efficient and fit for purpose - and hopefully in time create a easy way to adopt some of the great innovations put forward by other coins.
For now, perhaps it is easier and cheaper to send money with Ethereum or Litecoin - so it would make sense to use them for transferring value. If it does become apparent we're going to be waiting 5+ years to find a scaling solution then maybe should consider alternatives. In the mid-term/short-term we should all be rooting for Bitcoin to succeed.

Regulating exchanges is not the same as regulating Bitcoin... regulation of exchanges is a good thing because they're centralised and require so much trust. Insolvent exchanges will almost always be an issue unless somebody goes and reviews their accounts to stop them lying about having more Bitcoin than they do.

Bitcoin is about decentralisation and allowing people to take control of an aspect of their life that was previously dictated by governments and banks.
People who feel their own personal opinion should control how other members of society live are no different to the banks and the only reason they would care about bitcoin is so that they can turn a quick profit and sell off at the top. Those people are very hazardous to the long term survival of Bitcoin.

To be fair, some cryptos are great. Most of the good ones have a completely different aim than bitcoin and aren't really currencies.

It baffles me that people still think that if somebody bought 1 billion dollars worth of BTC that would increase the market cap by 1 billion. As if market cap is the "total value of all coins" or something and not just "the value of the last coin sold unrealistically multiplied by the supply"

+1. This is the biggest misconception of Market Cap. Equally, if the market cap was $2billion - you would still never ever be able to buy every bitcoin on the market for even $4 billion.
Market cap is useful for comparing the value of different cryptos and/or similar assets. Useless for calculating overall value.

The price would probably go down initially (panic sellers, etc.) but once the market stabilises and realises its not such a big deal, who knows?

Adoption and it's name. Every other coin was in some way created from Bitcoin - whether it was written from scratch or a fork of an existing coin, the idea came from Bitcoin and Bitcoin will always be seen as the "original" coin.
On a technical level, every other coin is either equal or better than Bitcoin. Some of the other coins have incredible innovations.
But.. at the rate technology moves these days and how quickly changing the crypto space is, theres no point in everyone migrating to the newer/fancier coin because in 6 months time another coin will come along better than that.
Bitcoin has it's flaws but its proven itself over nearly 9 years and in most of the first world its now a recognised name. We shouldn't be looking for new coins to move to, we need a solution to upgrade this existing block chain to make it more efficient and fit for purpose - and hopefully in time create a easy way to adopt some of the great innovations but forward by other coins.
For now, perhaps it is easier and cheaper to send money with Ethereum or Litecoin - so it would make sense to use them for transferring value. If it does become apparent we're going to be waiting 5+ years to find a scaling solution then maybe should consider alternatives. In the mid-term/short-term we should all be rooting for Bitcoin to succeed.

Typically, if Bitcoin makes a noticable move in either direction, other coins go down.
Reason being is that Bitcoin is still THE CRYPTOCURRENCY and used as a base currency across most cryptocurrency markets - some makets don't even have fiat pairings which means their price is always based in Bitcoin, not actually based in $.
When Bitcoin goes down, alts go down too because it knocks the confidence of the entire market.
When Bitcoin goes up, people fomo into Bitcoin, a lot of the time by selling their alts.
During positive market sentiment (like stability after a Bitcoin rally), people start trying to increase their Bitcoin positions by investing into other blockchain projects, which is usually when we get an altcoin rally.
So the answer to your question is the market follows bitcoin 99% of the time. Obviously sometimes altcoins break the trend and may get their own big move if something big happens, but its never permanent.

Every other price drop has been government regulation or exchange hacking, this is the only one where people have dumped because they've realised that Bitcoin is just not fit for purpose. As a store of value or currency.
It's currently just an inefficient system with a solution nobody is willing to adopt (Segwit transactions).
LN is a nice idea but nobody is skilled enough to get it rolled out quick enough. When they do, fee's will be at the discretion of the hubs who's interest will be to maximise their own profits - do not expect it to be the 'cheap' solution everyone will make it out to be. It will be more like 'priority sending at a premium'.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:13:43
You are absolutely right. Insolvency is an issue. That's why we need *some* regulation just to ensure exchanges are not faking numbers or pretending to have more Bitcoin than they do. However, most exchanges large enough to fake their numbers significantly .
This has already happened with Mt Gox and Cryptsy.

\^Just to add to this.
Bitcoin has nothing over any other coin other than its level of adoption. Bitcoin was the original concept and every other is technically superior - except the ones which are equal.
That being said, you could argue that Bitcoin is 'good enough' technically (after its upcoming enhancements) and trying to get another coin to be accepted the way Bitcoin is, may be a waste of time.
I for one welcome Litecoin.

The network/protocol itself is still decentrilised. The Bitcoin themselves are just bady distributed.
Technically they are owned by individuals. The exchanges obviously aren't allowed to just spend them.
Honestly, exchanges will never go away and they should be under strict regulation in how users funds are handled. (Exchange regulation is not synonymous with Bitcoin regulation!).

'The price' basically just means 'last agreed trade' which is why most exchanges directly call it 'last price'.
Remember each exchange is separate and have their own thousands of different people making buy and sell offers so prices vary between them but generally follow the same trend.
People sometimes take advantage of these gaps by buying up on one exchange and selling on another for more - this is called arbitrage.

A glorified singly linked list.
Each block contains a group of transactions and the checksum of the previous block.
Every blocks checksum must be below a certain value for it to be accepted on the end of the chain (for simplicity think of it needs to have a certain amount of leading zero's, the more specific it is, the more difficult it is to achieve). Miners are basically just creating a block and slightly changing it millions of times (specifically changing the 'nonce' fields) until its checksum is within the target range.
That target/difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks based on how fast they were completed so that it should take 2 weeks (1 block every 10 mins).
The reason it works is because everyone is just playing by the same rules and anyone and we mutually agree to just ignore anyone who doesn't. Sometimes people spread lies in order to get people to start following their rules instead of the ones of the original chain. This causes a fork and we end up with 2 different 'coins' with the same historic data up to the point it split.

Yes there is a "chance" since its basically a case of "pick a random number".

exchanges don't determine the price, USDT is traded just like any other coin so its actually the traders who determine it's price.
The difference with USDT is its backed by the 'promise' that it can always be redeemed for $1. depending on the confidence level in the promise, the closer the actual price will be to $1.
I suppose in that sense its not really a 'peg'. As you would expect a peg to mean somebody is always actively buying at the pegged value and preventing it going below.

I'd been holding my BTC since they were like $1200 back in December 2013. When they recently hit the 1xxx's again earlier this year everyone was really aggressively telling me I should sell up because 'they're obviously going to crash to $250 again'
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:38:27
^ Terrible advice.
If you can afford to deposit $50 without breaking the bank, do it. 
Getting involved is the best way to learn - Once you're familiar with how it works you can deposit more if you're confident. I'd even recommend going 50/50 on BTC and other Cryptos. There are some brilliant projects in the works, a lot more than just 'decentrilised payment systems'.

The actual economical impact will probably be zero (since CBOE volumes are not even a fraction of total Bitcoin trade volumes - CBOE haven't been relevant since Dec 2017). But the news that Bitcoin isn't relevant anymore will probably be bearish.

Dont forget about word of mouth though - people will be in work tomorrow talking about Bitcoin to their colleagues.
You're right, its flucuated $80b in the last day - on $15b volume. Market cap doesn't quite work the way people think it does and is only really useful for comparing value of different coins/similar assets. Bad for calculating overall value.
If somebody bought up $1.9billion worth of Bitcoin, it would increase the market cap by significantly more than $1.9billion (or potentially less - depending on sell pressure).

@_date: 2019-06-17 13:16:28
this is stupid, thats not how market cap, order books, supply/demand or markets in general work.
Currently you would need to buy about 950 BTC to lift the price from 9.25k to 9.3k, lets say we market bought at 9300 because we're really kind it would cost 8.8 million (in reality, we would be buying each sell order upwards so it would cost less)
we could raise market cap by 850 million by spending 8 million.
Then we have to factor in bots quickly dumping, hidden orders, etc.
Market cap is not just "Total value of all coins". 
TLDR: This makes no sense, you can't just say: "hey if we take the population of the earth and multiply it by 100, that would be the market cap!!!!"

The price went from like 7k to 19k in little over a month. Too many people buying in as an investment in 'internet money' without actually understanding what bitcoin actually is or its original purpose. 
Now interest has fell, no way near as many people are buying and the price can not be maintained.
Money can be made from price movements in either direction. So those with short positions are now taking advantage of a downward trend.

Legal owner. Probably not.
A lot of people will probably disagree with me.. but ownership would be treated the same way as cash or any other property.
If you found a bag of cash in the street you have a legal obligation to hand it in. Nobody just leaves cash around as free pickings - if you find it, it was either lost or involved in some kind of criminal activity - either way it doesn't just make yours.
If you find the key to a bike lock in the street and get access to the bike, that's not suddenly yours either.
Similarly, if you find a USB stick containing a private key, you can't suddenly say you own them fair and square because you've now encrypted them with your own private key. Just like you can't just find a gold bar in the street and say it's yours because you put it in your safe and the previous owner can't get to it anymore.
Ownership is determined by who owns the Bitcoins (be it through donation, buying, earning, etc.).
That being said, I highly doubt that anyone who loses a USB stick containing Bitcoin is ever getting them back!

How is tax on 10% profit "stupid"? Thats actually a pretty fair capital gains rate compared to what some other countries set their rate at.
For those of us in real civilised societies where we get free education and universal healthcare, it's only fair that we all pay a % into the pot to allow these services to exist.
That being said, if I lived somewhere where all taxes did was fund wars then I'd probably feel a bit cheated paying them.

Those people, like Elon Musk, will absolutely have more money, he will have a better car collection and a bigger home than most. Taxes dont stop that. Proper taxation just means little Timmy doesn't have to watch his parent's die of cancer because Mr Trump wants to look at a bank balance he will never spend.

Bitcoin has crashed multiple times in the past and has taken a different amount of time to recover every single time.
One previous crash in 2014 has no bearing 5 years later. Theres not even any guarantee we even see another ATH, Bitcoin was a very hot topic in December 2017 and lots of people bought in - nobody falls for the same trick twice.

Comparing daily volume  to cash inflow is retarded and isn't a thing. 'volume' includes the same bitcoins being bought and sold throughout the day. Whats the actual liquidity across all exchanges? With $1billion USD you would probably buy out the entire order book on any exchanges.
Tether has a total market cap of $2billion and a daily volume of $4billion.
$1 billion cash inflow would have a significantly larger impact than just increasing the market cap by 1billion.

It's your job to declare it, not to wait for them to come and find you to take it. Failing to declare and concealing it so you don't have to pay is tax fraud.
There are hundreds of arguments for and against tax, some people think its stealing, some people think its an investment in their community - that would be an entire debate of its own that I don't want to get into.
Regardless of your personal opinion the law says its your job to declare it and failing to do so is a criminal offence.

Apparently this is old news. Though IMO it wouldn't even be that bad if ICOs got banned.
Dont get me wrong, ICOs can be great. They're a great way for blockchain developers with big innovative ideas to get themselves kick started and there have been some really good ones. (Walton - RFID blockchain, NEO - Smart economy Blockchain, etc.). They're great for investors too - I've bought into many ICOs and investing into a startup early is always the best way to make a profit.
But.. you only have to check ICOAlert to see how many hundreds of ICOs there are right now. I would put money on 75% of them being straight up scams, with absolutely zero intention in delivering anything at all. 
When people like Floyd Mayweather and Paris Hilton are tweeting about ICO's its just blatantly obvious that they're hoping on pulling in the absolutely non-technical people who are unfamiliar with crypto currencies in order to take their money. Its wrong and unfair and something needs to be done.

Could be an easy way to increase my BTC holding as if it turns out to be something like "All exchanges closed down until they are issued a license" we may see some serious FOMO and price rally. 
If we dont then I'll accept its my own fault.

People struggle to accept its very unlikely they'll ever call the absolute bottom and any trend contains fluctuations in both directions at different levels. So when they buy and see it continue to decline they start to panic and end up selling again. Then it rises a bit and they buy back.

Me. Lee (or whoever manages this account), 
Have you considered reaching out to the Chinese government to come to some arrangement? or to work out what would be required for an exchange to be allowed to operate within the country or to offer some 'regulation' or 'control' over operations?
The government MUST know that banning exchanges wont stop Bitcoin, it won't stop people trading it and it certainly won't stop people holding it. So if it really was for the safety of the Chinese public, wouldn't it make sense to have a China controlled and regulated exchange instead of none at all?

You 'might' need physical access. If you type the internal IP of the router in your browser (If you don't know what that is, try 'ipconfig' in a command prompt and it'll probably be your default gateway)  you'll be able to access its control panel. If you don't have the admin username/password it will probably be written on the router itself.
The steps involved in port forwarding vary between routers but the basic principle is the same. Forward incoming port 8333 connections to your laptop.
As mentioned by virtually_sane above, portforward.com has a huge list of routers so that should help.

They got raided by the us feds last year losing some funds and have issued users 30% of their balance of each coin in tokens (I.e if you had 1000 LTC you'd now have 700 LTC and 300 LTCET). The reason for the extortionate fees right now is so they can refund the tokens for actual coins I think. 
If they eventually follow through and refund all tokens and start doing reasonable fees I'll be impressed considering the owners are fairly anonymous

When you encrypt a string using SHA256 it actually loses data.
Think about it...
The string:
encrypted using SHA256 produces the following.. The output actually contains less data that the input (it's half the size!):
obviously there are 'collisions' where multiple inputs produce the same output. But theres no way to 'mathematically reverse' it to find the input like you can with symmetrical algorithms like BASE64 encoding. The only way would be to do a 'reverse lookup' whereby you SHA256 encrypt millions of different strings until one of them produces the output your looking for. Goodluck doing that on your home PC in this decade.

Price went to 19k and has been dropping ever since. it doesn't matter what the price was this time last year. 
Dispite what people in this sub say: history rarely repeats and history rarely rhymes.
Past performance doesn't indicate anything about the future - all that matters is what's happening now. The price is currently going down and hasn't shown a single sign of stopping
When we hit 19k, Coinmarketcap was the most view financial website on the internet, coinbase was the most downloaded app on the app store and trade volumes were at 80 billion. We're struggling to maintain even 10% of any of that now. The only 'good news' we've been getting is from biased crypto news sites like bitcoinist and ccn

If you bought at $2, hold all the way up to $20k and sell at $2k you're a fucking retard.

'Current price' on each exchange/market pretty much just means 'Last agreed trade' but when you're looking at the price on just a site (Google, Coindesk, Coinmarketcap) its pretty much however they want to determine it. It could be just a average over different exchanges (sometimes also weighted by volume) or they might just use a single market.
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:38:56

@_date: 2018-04-17 12:37:59
Most people I know in the UK use Coinbase. Takes a couple of days to get set up though I think. 
Localbitcoins is faster but it's kind of private listings so you'll wanna only trade with the highly rated traders - which means paying a little over the current market rate. (Though that being said, I think Coinbase charge a fair bit over the market rate anyways so this might be your best option)
How familiar are you with Bitcoin? Honestly, If you buy 50 quids worth its definitely worth using like a tenners worth of that just to send between wallets, get a feeling for the way it works in terms of public/private keys, wallets and finding your transaction in a block explorer, etc.

how big of a chunk are we talking?
100 BTC is a pretty huge chunk I guess - it would't have too much of an impact on the price.
Or are we talking like 1million BTC? in which case it would have a pretty significant effect.
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:49:53

Price rise from 6.8k to 8k was all just the short squeeze. Absolutely nothing bullish about it, just too many bears. Now back down to retest 6k and likely into to the 5s

Nope it wasn't settled, the article you linked was from when the started the redemption not settled it. It's from the day they re opened after weeks of silence.
Look down the side the side the token redemption status is there for each coin and the token markets are still open.

Unless something big happens in Bitcoin, this is just going to keep going down.
@_date: 2018-04-04 13:07:25
I am. I'll admit that haha. It's not so much addiction to gambling or day trading.
It's more like... an addiction to always need to know what the price is (i.e constantly checking coinmarketcap) and always needing to know if theres any news or anything interesting happening, usually via Reddit, Twitter, news sites, etc. 
I think it differs from gambling and day trading because theres no desire to act on it - just know. I have a few coins which I intend to hold for 6 months+ at a minimum, some people even intend to 'long hold' for years. Yet there's always the need to know whats happening right now.
If I went 3+ hours without checking that would be unusual. It was the same back in 2013, massively reduced how often I checked between 2014 and 2016. Now, since 2017, I check all the time again.
@_date: 2018-07-16 18:15:00

What are you expecting to happen by posting this?
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:37:37
Hard to say.
It's almost certainly them moving coins from cold storage to the exchange hot wallet. So you could say its a good thing because it's a sign that a lot of people are buying.

The splitting thing can seem a bit more complicated than it is if you're not familiar with how it works. Your paper wallet essentially becomes valid on both networks, like you have a balance on both.

Unless you add some or withdraw, your paper wallet will contain the same number of bitcoins after Segwit activates. If by "increase in their valuation" you mean dollar price per bitcoin - nobody can answer that without speculating. In the event of a hard fork and BTC splitting, the paper wallet would be valid on both chains. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:49:16

This. Altcoins were alive before bitcoin had scaling issues. Hype will keep them alive after. I've increased my Bitcoin holding by around 100x my initial investment thanks to alt coins. I know a lot of people on are "anti-anything that isn't Bitcoin" but theres a larger profit to be made holding alts than there is holding BTC and those who are too stubborn to accept it are missing out. That being said, my 'Bitcoin count' fluctuates like crazy every day so if you're a panic seller then maybe alt trading isn't for you.

£10 is a good amount to invest to get a feel for how it works and develop some Bitcoin experience. You're never going to get rich from that £10 and it certainly won't buy you a car. When you will start to understand and become comfortable transferring coins between wallets and once you've got the hang of it you'll be able to slowly start adding to your stack. Download a few different desktop wallets and get a feel for which you like the most. Use some to buy yourself a cheap game from Steam so you can learn to understand how it can be used for payments. A lot of people are suggesting £10 isn't enough but they're wrong - its IS enough to use as a learning curve.

People like to victim shame on this kinda thing. Keeping that much money in an exchange *was* a stupid idea and in retrospect Im sure you now agree! That being said, the largest exchange shouldn't be keeping this much of somebodies money locked up and I really hope you get this sorted.
Fortunately this is just probably a security mess up and not a full on Goxxing/insolvency issue. Hope you manage to get it sorted.

its up 8% after a 50% drop in like 2 weeks...
short term correct until it continues downward
@_date: 2018-12-27 16:09:22
because 'HODLING' is for retards

Youll get the opportunity to buy back cheaper so its not all bad.

Localbitcoins would be your best bet
@_date: 2019-05-01 10:36:05

ETF will be delayed until Feb - 100% guaranteed based on the SECs recent comments.
People will sell the news and we'll definitely drop into the 2xxx's

When you sent the 1btc TO the hardwallet. Where did you send them from? An exchange? Coinbase? Check your account there and see if theres any record of them being sent.

Try not to let yourself get too stressed by price fluctuations. Bitcoin is VERY volitile. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 15:31:37
Price has been going down since January - i don't see why people are suddenly surprised. Price will hit $2000 before we see $5000
@_date: 2018-12-20 12:36:38
price is up from 3.3k to 4k and you're all acting like its moon time/calling a reversal. 
@_date: 2018-12-24 12:59:39
These temporary rallies are just to get more idiots to buy in
@_date: 2019-05-17 09:00:21
We don't care for their approval

Look on the bright side. You can all post your 'over 900' memes again in a month

Got that post card?

If you're alt coin trading to increase your BTC holding like I do, don't pay too much attention to the red itself. Use the BTC change value as your 0%. In this case -11.48% is your zero. XRP is doing OK in your screenshot.
Im pretty confident (or maybe naive) in BTC rebounding and hitting another all time high. So as long as my BTC count keeps going up, Im not too fussed about what the price is right now. Im winning.

Certainly not in my lifetime. VISA or Mastercard would have a replacement for cash long before Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:52:07
ATM's usually charge pretty grim fee's. Probably isn't worth it to be honest. Would get a lot less BTC than you should.
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:49:15
BTC is at 4k...
@_date: 2019-05-03 15:22:31
No because i would die in a matter of days,
Did you just compare your need for water with your need for bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:03:53
BTC will never reach the level of hype it did this time last year. It will never reach another all the time high. The world doesn't really care for it anymore 
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:07:28
No they are not buying all the way down.
This is something the people of Reddit have convinced you because they want you to buy. 
You can't call it FUD if it's the truth. Interest in bitcoin is gone. Using lies to try and get people to fomo in is a shitty thing to do.
People with real money will buy your bitcoin for 1k and sell it back to you for 2k. Rinse and repeat

Had 2FA enabled on every exchange except Polo (out of laziness). Going to enable it right now after reading this.
@_date: 2018-12-17 14:59:53
They probably didn't get as rekt as people who went long at any point during 2018
@_date: 2017-06-19 10:38:43
Nothing on there to identify who it belongs to?
