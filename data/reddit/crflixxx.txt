I'm on a 5 year path.....Bitcoin will hit a million a coin.  Just a question of is it 5 years from now or 10. I bet 5.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:32:34
I bought in at $9500.
Only regret is I didn't keep the 2 BTC I used to invest in Dogecoin.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:05:34
And now it's $10k.
On a 5 year path...you won't lose a dime and will gain minimum 5x your original investment.

If you're gonna "diversify" buy litecoin, don't get out of crypto. Bitcoin may eventually reach a peak, then people will look to cheaper coins to invest and there will always be a cheaper coin.

I've been thinking hard....problem is the deposit to your bank account delays would at best, give you 2 buy/sells a week if not 1, and you'd have to buy at least $5k+ to make it worth your while.

I screwed up a drunk buy a month ago, accidentally bought $4k of BTC or so from my bank account instead of my coinbase USD account. Filed a ticket they never got back to me and when it bounced I just got an email saying there was a problem with the order.
They didn't ban me, I've made byes and sells since, but my bank did give me a $20 charge for the overdrawn cancel.

Follow  on twitter and watch his periscopes. He's a GOP operative, but he's big into crypto and he called Litecoins price fluctuations with scary accuracy.
I got into a couple of coins when he said buy in and I'm up 5x on one and 2x on another, plus I got into Bitcoin at $9500 because of him so I'm overall up 20x now.
Only problem is since he's a conservative, if you're not it's hard to listen because he talks Trump and religion in a positive way, but he's 100% right on his crypto advice.

Dude...my first crypto investment was Dogecoin. Bought in at the high 3 years ago and it then went down 70%. I held....and 5 months ago sold it for 5x profit. Since then I'm up 20x.
Plan would be to get $15k, put $13k in crypto keep 2k in cash for first year payments. Worse case I have to pay out of pocket 6 months to a year, but I'm confident in it doubling every year.
Then second year go $30k with $26k in Bitcoin, 3rd year go over $50k, 4th year $70k then 5th year I've built enough capital and credit to get a $100k loan for a used low mileage Lambo.

@_date: 2017-12-29 06:05:44
Right, everybody saying don't go into debt....on a 5 year loan even at 15%, you're better off paying that interest since bitcoin will be minimum 10x in 5 years if not 100x.
I'm seriously thinking of getting a $15k loan, putting $13k into bitcoin or litecoin, spend the other 2k on the first years payments. Bitcoin has doubled every year except 2 years. One of those years it only went up 50%, and this year it's up 1500%.  That's as safe a bet as I've seen.

UBI would be doable, but lots of other stuff need to happen first. There need to be micro apartments people can rent for $100 a month in ANY city. People would live in a shoe box if it had a toilet and shower as long as it was in a city they could find work.
Once you had enough of those shoe boxes UBI could be done for those who don't want to work.

I bought $1500 worth of Dogecoin 3 years ago &amp; a month later it was worth $500. Six months ago I sold 80% of it for 5x return.

We don't know how much gold is in the earth, we know EXACTLY how many bitcoins will be mined. Always better to hold something with a finite supply vs infinite. Plus how much easier it is to get Bitcoin vs gold, anybody can mine bitcoin very few can mine gold couple that with beyond unfair salvage laws. If you find a sunken galleon with tons of gold, you have to give it back to Spain. Fuck that.
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:28:46
The rules are changing faster than our minds can adapt. I see a future where you're borrowing $100k, put $50k into Bitcoin, use $20k for first years payments, live off the other $30k. At the end of a year, you're flush if not up 5-10%.
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:09:30
I love how, despite people saying Bitcoin's changing everything, they're still stuck with this old fashioned thinking about debt. Bitcoin has doubled 5 out of 6 years or more.
Google "Bitcoin price", there's a number and a graph. The graph is slow growth, slow growth, then rocket's straight up. EVERY major company that becomes big has the same growth chart.
You are 100% better off going into debt now(especially if your credit is good) because paying that interest is way cheaper than cashing out that Bitcoin because the longer you wait to cash out, the more you're in profit.
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:44:10
Fair-ish point, the barrier to mining bitcoin(and other cryptos) is way easier than mining gold is the main point.
And sadly yes the Spanish government sued a long time ago a treasure hunter who found gold &amp; silver of the Florida coast and WON and it got it all back. You have a bit more leeway in international waters, but even then the laws are against you and you have to declare any wrecks you find and if you offloaded silver or gold from them.

When I first bought into Dogecoin I bought Bitcoin to trade it for Doge. That was 4 years ago and then 1 BTC was $600. One million Dogecoin was $500.
Both prices today reflect almost the same growth. I'm all in crypto now, no more banks. Any money I don't need for 5 years, is going into BTC, Doge &amp; BAT.

Or they banned ads so the price would go down, bought lots of Bitcoin to HODL, and now with ads back they're waiting for the top to sell?
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:52:52
Seriously, look at the price of Bitcoin Jan 1 of the last 6 years. Worse year was a 50% increase, best year(this) was 1500%. 5 years at 15% would cost $20k with around $30k profit at minimum and that's worse case scenario.
@_date: 2018-08-20 21:51:38

Either way I agree with the sentiment.
@_date: 2018-08-27 14:37:56
The last 6 years bitcoin has doubled every year except two...one year it only went up 50%. Last year it was up 10x. That's the growth every January 1st not it's peak.
That's probably what will happen again. So i'd bet $30k by this Jan, then $60k next year, etc... That's on track to hit a million by 2023, what I hope happens.

I originally got into Dogecoin 4 years ago. Two weeks after I got in I lost 70% of the value of my coins. Luckily the idea was in a year I'd be a millionaire or 10 years.
Well I'm on year 4 of what I now believe is an 8 year plan. 2023 is gonna be FIRE!!
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:29:16
I bought into Dogecoin when Doge was $500 for a million. Two weeks later it was $200 for a million. I held, forgot about it, now it's $2400 for a million.
Thank god the thinking was either in a year or 10 years I'd be a millionaire. On year 4 of what I now believe will be an 8 year journey. 2023 is gonna be fire!

When I got into Doge the thought was, either in 2 years I'd be a millionaire or 10. I think the 10 year plan still has some hope. I've still got over 100k+ doge so I'll sit on that til over 2020 and let's see what happens.

Fair point, but I'm in for 5-10yrs max, preferably 5.
When I got into Dogecoin I lost 70% value the next month. Sat on it for 3 yrs and up 700%. Yes you need to plan for at least 5yrs, but crypto is officially to big to ignore.

Coinbase is the easiest since you can buy instant with a credit card. They have a bad rep with large cash withdraws so be warned.
I recently got the Robinhood app and bought some Bitcoin &amp; Dogecoin. Very easy, BUT you can't transfer your coins off the exchange(it's insured however) &amp; bank transfers take longer than I'd like.
I am going to try and transfer between $20-50 a week to buy Dogecoin for a year or two, but no more Bitcoin buys there.
@_date: 2018-07-29 20:17:17
I would say all of them. When I got into Crypto, it was in Dogecoin. Over 3 years ago a million dogecoin cost $500, today $500 buys ONLY 132k doge.
I got out of Doge into Bitcoin 6 months ago, got into a few other cryptos then checked the total value of my portfolio vs if I'd just stayed in Doge....it was almost the same.
The rising tide of Bitcoin lifts all crypto.

If you're in the US the Robinhood app is easy to setup and buy.
In 2014 I had go the the dogecoin subreddit and go to the market subreddit and hope I didn't get scammed. Then I had to buy bitcoin on Mt Gox and send it to another exchange to trade it for Doge.
Poloniex looks like the biggest exchange for Doge, but depending on your country it might not work. AND once you're on the exchange make sure to check the volume and trade pairs. I was forced to buy XRP cause I send Doge to a shitty exchange, eventually traded to USD and the USD market was shit. Buying XRP was the only way I didn't lose 20% of the value of the Doge.
@_date: 2019-05-18 13:26:45

I feel ya. I got so lucky that the guy who told me about crypto(dogecoin to be exact, :) said in a year you'll be a millionaire or at worst 10 years.
I put all I had in 2014, and a week later my investment dropped 70%. I thought...."Well, I guess I'm on the 10 year path."
Now it's looking more like it will only be 8 years, but yeah, if in a couple of years I'm sitting on $250k it's gonna be so tempting to sell. I probably will sell $10k just to buy a new car and move to a weed legal state, but I will HODL til I'm a millionaire the majority of my coins.
