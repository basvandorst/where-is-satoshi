I bought my first the very same day. One more the day after. 2k. Lost a bunch of money and forgot about all my alt currencies I had. In June I realize I have half a btc that helps me pay for my house and yesterday I found out I have millions of reddcoin. I lost probably 30k yesterday. But still. Hold. It has been a good strategy for me.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:27:41
My only concern is that I don't have access to more fiat to buy some more.

That'd be a freakin bad movie. I love documentaries and still wouldn't watch it.  
The plot would be about a fan of bitcoin and al cryptos that even with the crypto bubble managed to lose money.  
Straight to dvd and netflix.

Thanks, that helped a lot. It's the second time I read bout it so I'm about to fully get it I guess. You cleared for me how transaction work !!!

First, you shouldn't ''keep'' your money in a bank. It would be stupid to invest it all in bitcoin as it's a high risk with a potential high reward (I wrote potential).  
You have to diversify. With that kind of money talk to an investment specialist. Those specialist are not into cryptos for now so keep a little for that, but only as much as you can lose. It could crash tomorow or make you rich the day after.  
For example I am young and don't mind risk, but on 100k I would put about 20 % in cryptos. The other older markets should do well this year.

Thanks Mike. I will keep on paying higher-ish fees on VOS as long as your business stays straight like it is today.  
Hopefully VOS will gain volume from this.  
Now that I have your attention : please add reddcoin ;).  
Seriously, good job.

Yes. We have to remember though that current one had to welcome a big surge in a very short span, which obviously created havoc. Hopefully the current exchanges will evolve quickly. Just to make sure : I ain't talking about Mt gox here, still shit.

Filing for bankruptcy is a legal process. Solid advice when under invesitgation or in a legal process : don't talk about it.
I would like to know as well, but not talking about it would be the advice he must have gotten from his lawyer.

Can you make a ELI5 explanation of how the blockchain works ? How are transaction processed ? I hope I made this clear enough. Thanks for doing all of this.

C'est une excellente idée surtout que c'est une ville qui gagne à se faire connaître.
Mon restaurant favori est la microbrasserie Charlevoix à Baie-St-Paul. Pour être honnête je mange rarement là parce que quand je passe c'est souvent pour aller voir ma famille sur la côte nord et je passe souper à la Malbaie !

I work with investment specialist. I manage accounts so I am not on the advice part.  
Yes, they work to get a commission, just as you walked into work this morning to gain money to feed yourself instead of spending all that time volunteering.  
These guys spend 50 % of their time tracking markets and getting knowledge. As much as I am interested in finance, somehow who spends time analyzing and reading about it all day + has education into is somehow better than me. My portefolio says it all.

It's a horrible advice. You have to think.  
Is today a better time to invest in typewrites companies than 20 year ago ?  
Is today a better time to invest in Blackberry than 20 years ago (if it existed by then I don't know).  
Don't get me wrong, I think the best time is still now regarding bitcoin, but discard the tree metaphor for any financial advice.
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:15:25
I'm gonna get downvoted but isn't bitcoin more of a stock than a currency at the moment ?

Hey you guys at bitcoin embassy. Do you guys have events or something planned ? I'm really glad as a montrealer that you exist.
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:25:09
Yes thanks I looked it up. I'm free and I want to go but : what are those meetings about ? What is discussed ?
Great website btw.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:58:05
My answer might seem vague, but it's my best take : Currencies change value every second as well. I just think that bitcoin at some point will settle and fluctuate much less, which will make it  usable as a currency. For now, it is presented as a currency, but pretty much seen as a stock.  
Historically, I have been told that currencies were invented to trade goods versus just swaping stuff (don't know the term in english). Bitcoin is different. It is somehow meant to replace currencies, which serve as paying for goods.  
I am sure I will be using bitcoin or another digital currency to pay for my groceries soon, but not now or not very soon.

Oh well thanks I might show up. I'm a newb, geeky but not computer geek so I'm more curious than anything. 
Do they talk about other cryptos as well ? I'm curious about the whole alt currency movement.
@_date: 2013-11-08 02:23:17
I won't as there is no basis for its current value beside pure speculation. If I buy now and it loses its value it won't be worth it. I am not gambling on this. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:34:36
Thanks for all the great info. I will go I think. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:44:30
Yes, it really doesn't apply everywhere. BRB, gonna invest in typewriters companies.

Ok cool I'm highly interested. Thanks !
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:21:50
Thanks yes. But it is presented as a currency, and I know it is its goal but right now it is hard to use it as a currency and the speculation surrounding it makes it look like a stock.  
There will need to be some kind of price setting before we can use it as a currency, because right now if I take a bitcoin wallet and go to the store its value can rise or dive 10 % by the time I get to the cashier.

Forget about it, throw away the hard drive, remember you had some bitcoins a few months after when the price rises and then try to find it at junkyard.
