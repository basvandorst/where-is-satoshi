Really? That's awesome. Thanks for the tip, I'll give this a shot myself.

Either that or you burn up in the Earth's core :(

Too bad Gemini isn't available in Europe. At least not in my country.
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:39:18
Right through the planet you mean?

Ugh the part about diversity quota's was cringeworthy. Silicon Valley ...
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:35:57
You've got to wonder who signed off on that name though. BAKKT ...

They could just hold on to it. There's no way to know how many end up in the trash.
OP should have included an expiration date so they could redeem the funds if not taken out.

That's not what he's implying at all. The tweet states Coinbase now has 25 million users, and with only 21 million BTC's in existence, a large part of which is permanently lost, it's impossible for all Coinbase users to hold 1 bitcoin. That's all. Don't overthink it.
@_date: 2018-10-03 12:42:05
A large portion is permanently lost though. And then there's the rest that's already privately owned. But even then, assuming suddenly every bitcoin in existence was available for purchase, and every Coinbase user had the means to pay for it, it would still be impossible for every Coinbase user to own 1 bitcoin. That's scarcity cool to think about.
@_date: 2018-10-30 12:21:04
That's actually really cool. Well done :)

Fellow Brit here. As long as we're out of the sinking ship, we'll be fine. Deutsche Bank is already going tits up.

As is Bittrex, who announced they are lowering their fees an hour after Coinbase announced they were raising theirs ;)
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:52:32
Obiously not or the market would be tanking.
I'm seeing insane optimism everywhere. Even all the crypto youtubers are calling for 15k easy. Which makes me take a step back.

FOMO'ed into ETH at $360. You're welcome!
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:54:37
I tried that once already. Didn't work out so well. I'll leave it to the newcomers to pump my bags :D
@_date: 2019-06-29 07:44:13
That's what I keep telling myself at night! ;)
@_date: 2019-12-18 00:50:21
Notice something? ;)
@_date: 2018-11-13 15:35:55
Good for him. Fuck Paypal. Closing the account I've had with them for years. The only service I really need it for is Ebay, and sales on that site have been tanking anyway.

Narrator: "It wasn't."
@_date: 2018-07-28 20:12:17
Because for now fiat currency is easier to buy things with. Although the ability to pay with crypto's sure is increasing fast, which I applaud.
@_date: 2018-07-28 11:49:57
It's possible to care about both. Sure, I'd like to take out a little profit to make my life easier, but I'd also love to see crypto's succeed in their goals and improve our world.
@_date: 2019-05-30 18:20:20
Man, that was a HARD rejection.
@_date: 2019-05-03 09:35:35
And it turned out to be one of the best long term investments you ever made, I'm guessing.
@_date: 2018-12-06 13:53:13
Good for you. Still doesn't mean you have to be a smug twat about it.
@_date: 2018-12-06 13:22:28
BTC has also lost 80% of it's value. Being a smug twat does you no service. Just be honest to the guy. Perhaps you'll both learn something from each other.
