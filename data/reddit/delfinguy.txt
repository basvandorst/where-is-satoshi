Will Bitcoin's price, measured in fiat, increase?  Certainly, eventually, over the long run.  Partly because fiat money always ends up being worth less and less until it gets close enough to zero, partly because every DAY, more and more people learn the truth about Bitcoin, and see its value.  Supply and demand.

They do this at our expense - yours and mine, along with just about everybody else you'll ever see.
This amounts to "legalized theft".  They didn't do work, take risk, or create anything of value.  They merely typed numbers into their banks' computers to rob us.

Gold's intrinsic value is about the same as aluminum or copper.
Don't let people trick you with their "intrinsic value" fallacy.
The whole point of "money" is to have little or no intrinsic value, rather, to have something that _represents_ actual value.   USD has no intrinsic value.  Gold has very little.  Bitcoin has none - yet it is the "hardest/strongest" money ever invented.

Correct.  If you're investing wisely:
1. You haven't invested money you might "need" in the next few year
2. You haven't invested money you cannot afford to outright lose
3. You understand what Bitcoin actually is, and the basics of how it works.  You also understand at least some of the problems it solves and how serious those problems can become
4. You're patient.  You're willing to wait for fiat to implode.  When it does, (not IF, but WHEN...) the price volatility we've seen will be NOTHING in comparison to where the value of Bitcoin is heading.
I see Bitcoin as a WAY OUT of doomed fiat money and a very corrupt system.
If you see Bitcoin as a way to accumulate more fiat, I'd like to encourage you to find out why people like me see things so differently.  After all, it's your financial future; it's your responsibility; you will either suffer or enjoy the consequences of things you choose to do/not-do today.

"Get loans to pay off your debt."  lol

@_date: 2018-09-16 03:13:29
First: Get out of debt. Stay out of debt. Save an emergency (liquid) cash cushion - enough to pay all your bills for one full year (two years, even better). Then save your investing money.
Don't invest more than you can't afford to either lose altogether or to have underwater/upside-down/locked up for a year or two (you don't want to be forced to sell at a loss). **Do not borrow money to invest**.
Don't put all your eggs into just one or two "baskets".  Bitcoin is one basket.
Carefully consider risks vs rewards.
Don't invest heavily in anything you don't understand.
Don't think you can "beat the market" by trading frequently - you can't. Nobody can. Ignore people with their "technical analysis". **Buy and hold.** 
Bitcoin: get some, then send it to a wallet for which YOU control the KEYs. Learn about securing your keys and keeping secure back ups and such before you invest significant amounts. **Remember: "Not your keys, not your Bitcoin.**" Don't get ripped off, phished, or hacked.
Most of all BE PATIENT and don't be stupid.
In the mean time, listen to Elmore James  recordings.
Best wishes!

Meanwhile, Bitcoin isn't going to burn down.  People aren't going to suddenly forget about the technology or the Bitcoin they own, or would like to own, or used to own and wish they'd held onto.  Bitcoin is here to stay, unlike the fiat money it is replacing.

Most people are broke and have piles of debts.
They can get a loan for a car.  They can get a loan and overpay for a home.  So they do... and they go deeper and deeper into debt.
They **cannot take out loans to buy crypto**.
Instead of admitting, "Yeah, I have no wealth to protect.  I have no money to invest, as great as this opportunity is..."  it's easier for them to try to ignore Bitcoin, badmouth Bitcoin, etc.

They recently created many tens of trillions of dollars worth of fiat money, have been using it to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies -- at YOUR expense (mine too).   They don't want more money, they're busy taking ownership of all the important STUFF: land, factories, minerals, oil, resources, businesses, media outlets...

Ah!  That's the "better" of the two possibilities I had in mind.
You know, when you've held a significant amount of BTC for more than two years or so, five percent is really "noise" compared to the gains you've already seen.
For example, 3 years ago, 1 BTC cost $238.  Today it's about twenty times that price.  Five years ago: $124 per BTC.  Today its' about fifty TIMES the price it was in early September, 2013.
Be patient.  Also, be frugal now, so you can eventually have all those nice things you're dreaming of...

Institutional money will not help the value/price of BTC.
The banking criminals will do what they've done to other assets, like gold (and even stocks).  They'll sell "paper Bitcoin" not backed by actual Bitcoin. 
This allows them to inflate the supply (or the perceived supply) of Bitcoin well beyond the 21 million limit which will actually suppress the price of Bitcoin as measured in fiat.

Point 1: "Printing more money" does not fix problems caused by "printing too much money".  You can't "print" prosperity.  The real problem is not "there isn't enough money" -- that is never the problem.
Point 2: More mythology.  If you're hungry, you'll buy food, even if food might be a tiny bit cheaper next month, for example.
Point 3: See point 1.  You can't borrow your way out of debt.

You're right.  The Federal Reserve could just suddenly decide that deflation is good, after telling us for over 100 years that deflation is bad.  Yes, indeed.  In theory, something like that COULD happen.
Chances are almost 100% that something like that won't happen.  Rather, we're extremely likely to see the dollar hyper-inflate at some point as it dies.  Why would it die?  Because it is only fiat currency, created at will by a small group for their personal benefit... and... fiat money always goes to zero, in the long run.

You didn't explain why fiat is better than "sound money".
Prior to 1971, the USD was backed by gold.  Nixon had to end that because there was a "run" on the US "bank" - and not enough gold to cover all the "notes" which were in circulation and claiming to be backed by gold.  In other words, the US "Fed" was lying and got caught.  That doesn't make fiat better, it shows that it's a "last resort" by desperate losers on the road to ruin.

I had been looking for something to store wealth/value, which would be difficult to detect and/or confiscate.  Gold: too heavy, sets off detectors.  Cash?  That's what I wanted to get away from (fiat money). ...
When I saw Bitcoin I said, "Is THIS what I've been looking for?"  Read the white paper... hmmm, maybe... did some research about the specific cryptographic hashes, etc. used.  "Yeah!  This is the REAL DEAL!"
I've had to slowly realize that a lot of people who are new to Bitcoin are only seeing it as this thing you buy, then sell to end up with more fiat - as opposed to an escape from fiat into something Way Better.

You are wise to avoid on-line (exchange) storage.  (seriously)
With a hardware wallet, you'll want to (need to) write down the seed words (and make a copy).  If you lose the piece of hardware, you'll be able to buy a replacement and enter the seed words again.  If you lose the seed words, you'll be so sorry!  So, keep two copies in separate locations (and secure from prying eyes, thieves, etc).
Or, you can be super-extra paranoid, use a "throw away" computer (about $35 or so) to generate one or more private keys, then write those down (two copies, secured in separate locations as before), but like another poster pointed out, getting the private key back into a wallet is not a trivial matter.  If you're a computer geek, you'll have no problem, you'll save the expense of one or two hardware wallets, and you won't have to fret that the hardware wallet maker put a "back door" into your device (like I said, this is the route for the extra-paranoid).

S. Ammous points out in his book, "The Bitcoin Standard," that each fiat currency always started as better money, backed by something, and then, over time, became gradually devalued.
Nutshell, greatly simplified example: people used gold coins, people stored their coins with the goldsmith who already had secure storage and the goldsmith gave them "notes" so they could get their gold back out.  People eventually started trading the notes instead of gold, but they were still backed.  The goldsmith would end up doing fractional reserve (which devalues the notes in existence).  Then, like the US in 1971, there's a bank run, and the banker doesn't have enough gold to cover...
Another greatly simplified example, a country is using sound money - coins containing a specific amount (weight) of gold, but then the foolish leaders decide to gradually reduce the amount of gold in the coins, over time, until there's none at all, and eventually that shit crashes, burns, and dies.
Throughout history, fiat money has been the road to ruin, and today's fiat currencies are no exception.

When they create fiat money like that, it amounts to theft.  So, they and their cronies are ultra-rich because they and they alone run a very crooked system, and **not** because they are smarter, **not** because they work harder, **not** because they have ever contributed anything significant to humanity.  No.  They are scumbags - evil scumbags.
Bitcoin helps put an end to their corrupt system of theft.  Under a fair system, **your share of the planet's wealth should be about one billionth, give or take, depending on how hard you work, how smart you work, and how your work affects the welfare of humanity in a positive way.**

This is an interesting topic.
Look up, "Fractional Reserve Banking," and also look up, "bank run".


Long ago, people used gold as money.  Gold is difficult to store securely, so people would pay the goldsmiths to store their gold, since the goldsmiths had to have secure storage anyhow.  The goldsmith would give them a "note" in exchange, so they could get their gold back out, later.  Often, the goldsmith would start lending more "notes" than there was gold in his vault to cover...  people would hear about it, and literally "run" to the "bank" to get their gold before the rest of the town showed up.
**Bitcoin is different** in that it is not difficult or costly to store securely.  **There is no need/reason to let somebody else "store" your Bitcoin for you**.  Do it yourself.
If you're dumb enough to allow some exchange or "custodial service" to store your Bitcoin, then you should expect a "bank run", where you'll be locked out and lose your money.

Right.  144 blocks per day, **on average**.
Cannot work ahead because they would need the "hash" value of the prior block(s), which isn't/aren't known yet.

It won't be a mere "recession".  The old "business cycle" your parents/grandparents grew up with is over and it isn't coming back.
The prior downturn was no "recession".  The economy basically imploded and the Federal Reserve (and other central banks) did what was previously unthinkable: they began to monetize the debt and to bail out selected losers.  They started creating their fiat currencies in previously unheard of amounts.  Since around 2007, tens of trillions of dollars worth of central bank "play money" has been created, from thin air, backed by nothing -- at the expense of the rest of us.  This is not sustainable.
The global economy is still on "life support" from the prior meltdown.  The next downturn hits a fragile, ailing economy where central bank rates are already at/near/below zero.
@_date: 2018-08-27 22:47:34
I guess so.  That would drive up the price of BTC relative to their fiat currency "play money".

I'm lucky that I got to live during a time when a New Kind of Money was invented and when it began to replace the existing crap foisted upon us by criminals.
The price of Bitcoin right now is about two and a half TIMES what it was just one year ago, and about EIGHTY TIMES what it was a mere five years ago.  That trend is not because of "luck," rather, it is because BITCOIN IS SOUND MONEY.
Bitcoin Is Good For You.
The price more than doubles every year, on average over the long run, because more and more people are finding out the truth about it.  Hooray for the truth!
Hooray for Bitcoin and Sound Money!

Let S be, "they know the secret recipe".

We have not B, therefore, we have "not S".

Get out of debt.  Stay out of debt.  Save an emergency (liquid) cash cushion - enough to pay all your bills for one full year (two years, even better).  Then save your investing money.
Don't invest money you can't afford to either lose altogether or to have underwater/upside-down/locked up for a year or two (you don't want to be forced to sell at a loss).  Do not borrow money to invest.
Don't put all your eggs into just one or two "baskets".  
Carefully consider risks vs rewards.
Don't invest heavily in anything you don't understand.
Don't think you can "beat the market" by trading frequently - you can't.  Nobody can.  Ignore people with their "technical analysis".  Buy and hold.  Have an exit plan before you invest ("I'll sell X amount when this happens, or else I'll sell all of it if that other thing happens."
Stocks: consider an S&amp;P500 index fund, then let it sit until you get old.
Gold: don't buy "paper gold," only buy physical gold that YOU store; get an ultrasonic thickness gauge and learn how to detect gold coated tungsten before investing heavily in gold.
Bitcoin: get some, then send it to a wallet for which YOU control the KEYs.  Learn about securing your keys and keeping secure back ups and such before you invest significant amounts.  Remember: Not your keys, not your Bitcoin."  Don't get ripped off, phished, or hacked.
Real estate: most people think they understand it.  Very few actually do.  It's highly overrated and has considerable risks.  Better to get rich, then buy real estate than to plan on getting rich by purchasing real estate.
Keep some cash handy for those rare occasions when a fantastic deal comes your way.  Still, remember, if it sounds too good to be true...
Most of all BE PATIENT and don't be stupid.
In the mean time, listen to James Brown recordings.
Best wishes!

Get out of debt. Stay out of debt. Save an emergency (liquid) cash cushion - enough to pay all your bills for one full year (two years, even better). Then save your investing money.
Don't invest money you can't afford to either lose altogether or to have underwater/upside-down/locked up for a year or two (you don't want to be forced to sell at a loss). Do not borrow money to invest.
Don't put all your eggs into just one or two "baskets".
Carefully consider risks vs rewards.
Don't invest heavily in anything you don't understand.

You kindly echo the "conventional" reasoning: USD backed by military power.
However, it's the other way around.  Military power is backed by the currency.  Proof?  History.  Examples?  The former Soviet Union had significant military power.  Had.  
Military power is expensive.  It must be paid for: equipment, supplies (food, etc), fuel, parts, labor.  Must be paid for with money that is worth something.  You stop paying, you stop getting.  When the currency fails, military power evaporates...

The guy speaking in the video says that backing a currency doesn't matter.  I disagree.
However, there is no "substance" backing Bitcoin, that is, you can't take it to a bank and trade it for something physical .  So, technically, it doesn't matter in Bitcoin's case that it is not backed because it's supply is limited.
However, with fiat currencies, we see that they end up being created by the billions, then trillions, then hundreds of trillions ... into oblivion, to the detriment of the population and the benefit of certain bankers and their cronies.

Good question.
Short answer: we won't have any more recessions because the next downturn is going to be such a huge disaster that we're likely to see the death of "money" as most of us have come to know it.
Fiat currencies are doomed.
Do you know anything about the prior financial crisis (2007/8/9)?
Nothing got fixed as a result of that.  In fact, we're in worse spot now than when that happened: global debt-to-GDP ratio, central bank rates already at or near zero percent (or negative in certain cases).
The prior downturn hit a relatively healthy economy pretty hard.  The next downturn hits a global economy which is still on "life support" from the previous downturn.
Fiat money is not backed by anything.  It is created from nothing ("thin air") by central banks, backed by nothing.  When central banks create money like that, they're robbing the rest of us -- it amounts to theft.
When the next downturn hits, the chances are high that there will be more bail outs, AND (something "new") bail-INS, where depositors/investors simply have their stored wealth confiscated.
Bitcoin cannot be created from "thin air" like fiat currencies are.  Bitcoin (if stored properly) cannot be confiscated (to bail out criminal bankers, for example).
@_date: 2018-08-16 16:13:36
Hooray for strong encryption.
Hooray for "strong money" (Bitcoin) to protect us from weak fiat "play money" and the criminals who create it from thin air to enrich and empower themselves by stealing from the rest of us.

The "news" you see on tv and hear on radio is fake.
A **ledger**.  A list of every Bitcoin **transaction** ever made.  Transaction: when an amount of Bitcoin is sent from one address (account) to another.
This ledger is special.  It is **immutable, public,** and **distributed** on many thousands of computers all over the world**.**  It is protected by cryptography and unimaginable amounts of computer power 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  There can be no double spending.
The supply of Bitcoin is predetermined, and limited.  No central banker can create Bitcoin from "thin air" as they've been doing with their fiat currency "play money".  No person, no government, no bank gets to say, "Let's create 5 trillion new Bitcoin backed by nothing and use it to bail out ourselves and our cronies."
When stored properly, nobody can confiscate or steal your Bitcoin money.
Bitcoin is a form of "good/strong/hard/sound" money.  Fiat money is not.
Bitcoin is like gold in certain important ways, and yet, Bitcoin is even better than gold in certain other ways.
Bitcoin is a good way to protect wealth against kleptocrats and the criminal bankers they work for.  Banksters hate you and think they're inherently better than you and the rest of us.  Banksters have been stealing from you.
Fiat money is doomed.
Bitcoin is strong.
Bitcoin is good.

The US government, like several others, is currently owned and operated by criminal banksters. 
Those banksters have the sole ability to (legally) create USD from thin air, and have created many trillions of USD.  They've been, and still are using those trillions to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies (at our expense).  They own the law makers, the executive branch, they have judges in their back pockets...  They've gotten the so-called "supreme" court to declare that the money they spend to buy politicians is "free speech" for example.

The "intrinsic" value of gold is about the same as aluminum or copper.
Money, by its very nature - by design - has little or no intrinsic value.  After all, money is just "general purpose IOUs".  As with any IOU, there must be trust, but I won't delve into that here and now.
What makes something (gold, bitcoin) a form of "good money" or "sound money"?  It has all 7 of these characteristics:
1. Durable
2. Divisible
3. Portable
4. Fungible
5. Recognizable
6. Rare (scarce)
7. Difficult to counterfeit
Fiat money lacks 6, and 7.

The public address is generated from the private key.
The private key is (**hopefully**) a random number, or "random enough".

Today, we have a small group of people (central bankers) with the sole ability to create all the money they want from thin air, backed by nothing.  Since around 2007, they've created many tens of trillions of USD worth of their "play money". Trillion - with a T, that is 1,000,000,000,000.  They've been using that money to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies -- at the expense of the rest of us.
Their corrupt, inherently flawed system of money and banking is doomed; one day it will suddenly collapse.  When it does, you'll wish you had Bitcoin and/or gold/silver coin, or all three.

The "intrinsic value" thing...  Other things to consider: ALL money, by its very nature, by design, has little or no intrinsic value.  Gold's intrinsic value is on par with Aluminum and/or copper.  Most USD, Euros, Yen, etc. are digital (90% or more) -- those dollars have zero intrinsic value.

It would seem the only way for the IRS to know about our Bitcoin activities: get the Exchanges to rat us out, which is exactly what they've done.
So, if you sell me a bicycle for 0.035 BTC and I send it to your wallet... who's going to notify the IRS?  Not me.  Would you?
Now, if you take that BTC to Coinbase and exchange it for USD, they will tell the IRS.  But that's your problem, not mine.

Frequent trading is a good way to end up broke. Each trade carries risk and expense. Eventually, the risks and fees win, and the frequent/day trader loses.
Meanwhile, over time, the value of Bitcoin has more than doubled each year (on average, over time). If that's not a high enough return/yield for you, you're fucked up, stupid, or both. So, just buy, and hold, and be happy someday that you were patient.

When somebody posts any kind of Technical Analysis here...
Stop and think.
What is the purpose of TA? To show us where the price has been lately? No. We can just look at a chart and see it - no analysis needed. Is the purpose to tell us the current price? No. We can look at various "tickers" and see the current price - no analysis needed. The purpose is to predict near-term price changes. In other words, "predict the future".
What is the point of trying to predict the future? To make money.
Can TA predict the future well enough to allow people to use it to make money? Suppose it could, if you knew the right technique to employ. Suppose you figure out such a technique, and it works reliably. What are you going to do? I can tell you, my heart would be pounding with excitement and the last thing I would do about it is tell anybody. Certainly, I'm not going to go blab it onto the Internet! Seriously!
The reality is this. There is no such thing as TA which can reliably predict the future. Nobody beats the overall market average over the long run. "Extrapolation is seldom an accurate predictor."
Here's a second thing worth considering. Speaking of long run average... the value of Bitcoin has more than doubled per year, on average, long term. I see no reason for this overall trend to end. I do see reasons for it to continue, but that's a different topic for a different post.
With returns like what we've been seeing, long term, who needs to predict tomorrow's price, or next week's price? Idiots, that's who. For Bitcoin investing, TA is useless, even IF it works. If doubling your money every year isn't good enough for you, you're fucked up, and earning at an even higher rate isn't going to satisfy you -- your problems lie elsewhere.
If, on the other hand, doubling your net worth every year (on average) is good enough for you, then just buy and hold Bitcoin - no analysis needed. No risky trading. No trading fees.

Amount?  I put in "some money" every month, typically, like it's a bill I just have to pay.  Markets go up and down.  When they go down, you get to say, "Oh, yay, it's on sale..."  When it goes up, you get to run around the house in your underwear yelling, "MUUU--HA--HA--HA--HA--HA!!!"

Fiat money is doomed.  Fiat money is weak and worthless - literally worthless.
Bitcoin is strong.  Bitcoin is sound.  Bitcoin is good.
We now have a small group with the ability to create all the fiat money they want from thin air, backed by nothing.  Since 2007 or so, they've created many tens of trillions of USD worth of their "play money" and have been using it to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies.  At our expense.  Yes, they get to "rob" you whenever they want.
What can you do about it?
Stop using their play money.  As much as possible, use forms of "sound money" which they cannot create on a whim: physical gold and Bitcoin.
Fuck the bankster pigs.  Use Bitcoin.

I'm not saying, "Bitcoin has gone up, therefore, it will just always go up."
I say, "it goes up and down, but the long-term trend has been up and I see no reason for the trend to end."  In other words, I look for the reasons for Bitcoin to exist and to be adopted and desired, and when I look at the BIGGEST PICTURE I can fit into my mind I see the current fiat system imploding and more people learning about Bitcoin and learning about the inherent problems in the current system... Those things (and more) are why I expect Bitcoin to become even more valuable in the future, vs, "Well, it went up, therefore it will go up."

Please allow me to kindly suggest to you that buying ONE lottery ticket is the best deal in town, whereas, the 2nd through nth lottery tickets, for the same lottery are "really dumb".
Yes, mathematically, every lottery ticket, even the first, has a relatively low "expected value".  This is a fact.  You are kind and helpful to point it out.
However, the FIRST ticket for a given jackpot buys the holder something precious: HOPE.  Yes, for a mere buck (or two)j you can buy HOPE for one week.
What do I mean, "hope"?  Let's say your boss is giving you shit, just because he can (and he's a dickhead anyhow).  In the back of your mind, you get to say, "If I win the lottery ..."   Price of groceries goes up?  "Man, when I win the lottery, I'm going to eat .... every night and wash it down with ...."
I think most people would agree that such "hope" is worth about a dollar per week.

Let me make up a hypothetical example, to illustrate a point.  Three sisters Alice, Jane, and Wanda.  Two years ago, their uncle died and left $12K to each of them.  One of them heard about this new Bitcoin thing and told the others.  Alice decided to put her $12K into a bank account.  Jane and Wanda bought 20 BTC each.
One year later, Alice had $12,063 in her bank account.  Jane said, "Woo-hoo!  My Bitcoins are worth over $100K."  She sold them, bought a BMW, and put $15K into her bank account.  
Wanda held.  Bitcoin got her interested in things like money, the history of money, gold and silver, banking, and so on.  She realized that the USD is a fiat currency, created in the trillions by the Federal Reserve, backed by nothing... She learned about what happened during the 2008/9 financial crisis and could see "part two" of that crisis on the horizon.  She saw what happened in Venezuela.  Today her BTC are worth about $300K.  She's patient.  She's informed.  She waits.
A few years later, Wanda buys a nice home, using Bitcoin.  She buys a nice car, using Bitcoin.  And she still has Bitcoin left over in her wallet.  Jane has nice car.  Alice has $12,500 in her account, but with the high inflation, she can barely buy a month's groceries with it.

* The central bankers have the (sole) ability to create fiat money from thin air.
* The central bankers have indeed created many tens of trillions of dollars worth of the "play money" since about 2007.
* Bitcoin threatens the central bankers' very existence, or at least, it puts a huge "DENT" in their sweet monopoly
* The bankers and/or their cronies are buying and selling Bitcoin in massive amounts in order to create and/or amplify volatility in the price of Bitcoin -- even if it costs "a lot of money".
It doesn't cost them anything, personally, because the "a lot of money" was created from thin air.
Then, they (and the mainstream "news" stooges) get to point at the volatility and criticize Bitcoin for it.  That's right, criticize Bitcoin for the very thing they created (in theory).
Also, the price drops tend to financially hurt a lot of new/young/inexperienced investors... gives them a bad initial experience.

No - because you're ignorant.
You're a fool because you're bickering about something you don't understand with a person who does.
Therefore, you are an ignorant fool.

Bitcoin cannot be created from thin air.  The supply is limited.  Over time, the demand grows.  Supply and demand.
Do you know how big "one trillion" is?  It's okay if you don't.  It's a really, really big number, and people who work with big numbers all the time have a hard time grasping just how big one trillion is.
So, a trillion is one million times one million.  Stay awake!   **One trillion dollars is enough money to make a million millionaires.**
The Federal Reserve, has created several trillion dollars recently - from thin air, backed by nothing.  Chances are nearly 100% they will create many more trillions in the coming years.  Trillions.
Meanwhile, there are fewer than 20 million Bitcoins.  There will never be more than 21 million Bitcoins.  In fact, people estimate that many Bitcoins have been "lost" and so there will never be more than 17 or 18 million.
The Federal Reserve created 3.5 trillion dollars in 6 years.  That's over one million dollars **per minute**.  
Think: 20 million Bitcoins, max.  Probably less.  The Fed created 20 million dollars every 20 minutes.  How "valuable" can a dollar be when some dickhead bankster can create a million of them every minute of every hour, night and day, seven days a week for 6 years?    When they create more dollars, all the existing dollars are **devalued.**  
When dollars are devalued, people get robbed.
**Think about it: ultra-rich banksters rob poor people.  Is that fucked up or what?**
Bitcoin cannot be created from thin air.  The supply is limited.  Over time, the demand grows.  Supply and demand.

When somebody posts any kind of Technical Analysis here...
Stop and think.
What is the purpose of TA? To show us where the price has been lately? No. We can just look at a chart and see it - no analysis needed. Is the purpose to tell us the current price? No. We can look at various "tickers" and see the current price - no analysis needed. The purpose is to predict near-term price changes. In other words, "predict the future".
What is the point of trying to predict the future? To make money.
Can TA predict the future well enough to allow people to use it to make money? Suppose it could, if you knew the right technique to employ. Suppose you figure out such a technique, and it works reliably. What are you going to do? I can tell you, my heart would be pounding with excitement and the last thing I would do about it is tell anybody. Certainly, I'm not going to go blab it onto the Internet! Seriously!
The reality is this. There is no such thing as TA which can reliably predict the future. Nobody beats the overall market average over the long run. "Extrapolation is seldom an accurate predictor."
Here's a second thing worth considering. Speaking of Long Run average... the value of Bitcoin has more than doubled per year, on average, Long Term. I see no reason for this overall trend to end. I do see reasons for it to continue, but that's a different topic for a different post.
With returns like what we've been seeing, long term, who needs to predict tomorrow's price, or next week's price? Idiots, that's who. For Bitcoin investing, TA is useless, even IF it works. If doubling your money every year isn't good enough for you, you're fucked up, and earning at an even higher rate isn't going to satisfy you -- your problems lie elsewhere.
If, on the other hand, doubling your net worth every year (on average) is good enough for you, then just buy and hold Bitcoin - no analysis needed. No risky trading. No trading fees.

A parable.
Long ago, in a land far away, a famine was coming. Some people could see it coming, others either failed to notice or had decided in their minds that there would be no famine. Still, the famine was coming.
The wise people began to buy and store grain for themselves. The price of grain went up. Speculators took note and began to buy grain as well. This caused a massive FOMO spike in the price of grain, until it peaked and began to fall, but not without volatility. Traders tried to guess which way the price of grain would go next. Most of them ended up broke.
Wise people continued to hold their grain; those who were able, continued to accumulate it.
The unwise saw grain as merely a way to accumulate piles of local fiat currency. They sold their grain and stashed the money.
Then the famine arrived.
What good is a pile of local fiat currency when there is no food in the market and your stomach has been empty for days?

I agree.
"Military Industrial Complex," for example.  Look at the US military budget compared to the rest of the world, then ask yourself, "WTF?"  People getting rich killing people in other countries, people getting rich selling the weapons and supplies for those activities, and people getting rich by creating fiat money from thin air to lend to the US to pay for all that BS, and charging interest.
Our best way to fight back against such a system: stop using central banker fiat "play money".  As much as possible, use forms of money they can't create from thin air: gold, silver coin, and Bitcoin - for example.

Gold is a form of "sound money," because it has all of these properties:
Durable, divisible, portable, fungible, recognizable, scarce, difficult to counterfeit.
Bitcoin also has all of those properties.  Bitcoin is also a form of "sound money."
Be careful, if buying gold.  There is a lot of gold coated tungsten being sold.  Since the density of tungsten is very close to that of gold, you need an ultrasonic thickness gauge and you'll need to know how to use it -- test every piece of gold you buy.

Oh yes.  I'm sorry.  I did neglect to make it perfectly clear that:
1. I have no idea why the price changes from day to day
2. It doesn't matter to me, I really don't give a fuck (honest)
3. If you knew what I know, you would not be concerned about daily, yearly, or monthly price changes
Some of the best "financial" advice I ever heard (and I've heard quite a lot): **Look at the BIG PICTURE.**
The bigger, the better.  Try to understand how things relate to each other.  Understand, for example, that money is just a "general purpose IOU," but central bankers have created tens of trillions of dollars worth of "IOUs" which claim that we owe them products, assets, services, etc. for that amount (we don't).  Understand that they're not the first set of clowns to ever try that stunt.  Know that they'll fail, and are actually failing just like the clowns before them... etc.  Fiat money always ends up failing.  Take yourself up, in a balloon, to 12,000 feet and have a good, long look at the "big picture".  Compared to that, worrying about last night's price movement is like focusing on ripples in the ocean vs. knowing that the tide is about to come in...

I know it stings to lose money, especially 0.05 BTC.  But it hurts for a reason: to teach you.
I sincerely hope you'll learn from this; if you do, in the long run it have been worth the initial loss.  Think of it as part of the cost of "education".  ("*If you think education is expensive, try ignorance."*)
There will be bigger, trickier, more sophisticated scams later, but (hopefully) because of your recent experience, you won't fall for them.
For example, somebody tells you, "There's a tax advantage."  Make them show you all the math.  Even the slightest hesitation from them says, "there's no math, only bullshit."  The person may be lying to you, or they might actually believe the lie.  Even if they show you the math, double check it, ask around to see if they've left out an important expense or risk.
Best wishes!

In a nutshell, Bitcoin has a pre-programmed and finite supply (it's supply is predictable).  It requires a significant investment of resources (electrical, etc.) to produce any amount of Bitcoin.
Fiat is created from thin air, backed by nothing.  It can be, and has been created by the tens of trillions of USD worth in the last several years.  It requires virtually zero resources to create a trillion USD, for example.
When the supply of fiat money increases, it robs wealth from innocent people.

They own the too-big-to-fail banks.  They own and operate the central banks.  They therefor control the creation of fiat money from nothing.  Why bother using their "play money"?  It just makes them richer.
They own the most of the mainstream media.  Why bother watching that crap?
They "own" most of the politicians and major political parties (thanks, in part to "Citizens United" and freshly "printed" fiat money), and they "own" some important judges.  Why expect justice?  Why expect the government to follow the laws?  Why expect the banks to follow the laws?  Why expect the press to follow the laws?
At this point, a lot of knuckleheads retort, "**What you going to** ***DO*** **about it?"**

@_date: 2018-08-13 01:26:12
Oh yeah!


I trust crypto more than I trust my bank, my government, or my neighbors.
Not sure I understand what you mean by Bitcoin avoiding the 2008 scams.  I know that if we used money that cannot be created from thin air, then the huge debt bubbles could not be blown in the first place.  I know that when the SHTF around 2008, that the Federal Reserve and other central banks would not have been able to bail out themselves and their cronies.  I know that they did anyhow - and illegally.  I know that none of those banking criminals went to jail as a result.  I know that if I don't pay my parking tickets, I might end up in jail.  I know that those criminals were bailed out at the expense of the rest of us.
The Bitcoin revolution changes this:
Right now we have a small group (central bankers) with the sole ability to create all the fiat currency they want.  Since about 2007 they have created many tens of trillions of dollars worth of their play money.  They have been using it to enrich and **empower** themselves and their cronies.  (Governments now answer to them.  The US, for example, has been silently overthrown by criminal bankers.)  When these bankers create money from thin air, it is backed by nothing, and they, in effect, ROB the rest of us.  We have ultra-rich organized criminals robbing the poor, the middle and even much of the upper classes.
The best way to fight back against these criminals is to merely stop using their play money.  Hence, Bitcoin, gold, and silver coin.

Maybe one or more of these will cheer you up:
Banksters will be banksters, but now we can choose to use Bitcoin, and they can't just "take" from us any longer.
Bitcoin is here to stay; people aren't going to just "forget" that it ever existed.
Bitcoin still costs more than twice what it cost just one year ago.  Yeah, the price goes up, and it goes down, but so far people who hold patiently have been extremely rewarded.
Two or three years might sound like a long time to you, and in some ways it is, but the time will pass.  Be patient.  On average, over the long term, the price of Bitcoin has more than doubled per year.  I see no reason for that long term trend to end.  Be patient.
If you don't like waiting - put your money into a bank account and see how long it takes to double.  Ugh.
The current global banking system is not only corrupt, but it is doomed because of inherent flaws in their fiat "play money".  Again - patience.  When (not if) their system collapses, Bitcoin holders will "rule".

The reason Socialism ultimately fails has a lot to do with the fact that they try to have a **Centrally Planned Economy** where bureaucrats dictate prices (instead of letting free markets determine prices).
Here's what most people don't understand: **Today's Central Banks (including the Federal Reserve) are "centrally planning" the global economy** by setting the most important price of all: the price of borrowing money.
Like the Socialists and the Communists and all the other fools who ever tried to dictate prices, they will fail, and in fact are already failing as I type this, and as you read it.

Mining has two rewards.  One is an amount of BTC rewarded for solving a block (the one you mentioned).  The other reward is transaction fees.
When people want to send BTC from one address to another, they "tip" the miner -- this gives the miner a reason to include their transaction in their block.  Block rewards go down over time.  Transaction fees will likely go up over time.

 [GOLDMAN SACHS: Bitcoin is never coming back](
Which is it?
@_date: 2018-08-04 01:59:42


It's good that you're concern about what backs your money!  Most people never give it any thought.
Think about the US Dollar, prior to 1971.  It was backed by gold.  Now it isn't.
Is a dollar backed by gold better than one backed by nothing?  I think we'd both agree that it is better to use little green rags backed by gold as opposed to being backed by nothing.
So, ask yourself, "**What backs gold?**"  I did.  I don't remember exactly when.  But I found out!  I'm glad I did.
Gold is backed by its inherent properties:
1. Durable (it won't rust, rot, or evaporate)
2. Divisible (you can make bars, coins, tiny coins, one gram 'bits', etc.)
3. Portable
4. Fungible (one ounce of pure gold is as good as any other ounce of pure gold)
5. Recognizable (see below)
6. **SCARCE**
7. Difficult to counterfeit (or, hard to produce)
*Note about  Xenon gas, for example, has all of the above properties* ***except*** *  If I gave you a glass tube filled with clear gas, you would not be able to tell whether it was really xenon or nitrogen or just plain air.*
Note that the USD (and other fiat currencies) fail both  and 
THAT is what backs gold: it has those 7 properties.
Little green rags/notes?  They don't have all 7 of those properties.  But, if the person/institution giving one to you says, "You can turn this in for *this much* ***gold*** any time," and you **trust** them, then those rags/notes are "backed by gold" and gold backs itself.
Bitcoin also has all seven of those properties.  Bitcoin also backs itself.


I keep some emergency "fiat money" in my wallet.  It is not insured or protected.  It is very easy to lose, if I'm careless.  When I was young I had to learn the hard way not to lose my keys, and to not lose my wallet.


You are correct.  Bitcoin is relatively new, and global.  It didn't even exist ten years ago.  So, is it ***really reasonable*** *to* expect it to gain global, mainstream adoption in fewer than ten years?  I don't think so.  Apparently, you disagree.
Still, it has been gaining adoption.  My personal opinion is that when the next financial crisis hits, it will be a big one, and lots of "unimaginable" things will happen as a result, some of which will cause people with wealth to protect to flock to Bitcoin.
Notice I said, "wealth," instead of "money".  There's a huge difference.
Finally, you don't think Bitcoin will ever be at the point of "mainstream adoption".  Maybe you're right.  Still, you don't get "ahead" by staying in the middle of the herd.
Best wishes.

The moral of this story: **Be patient**.  Be patient with an exchange which has to jump through flaming hoops of financial regulation.  Be a **patient, long-term investor.**
I've used Coinbase for years.  It's WAY better than what I had to use prior.  It's "slow" in that it takes a while for them to get everything all set up with your bank so that you can do your first purchase (banking regulations' fault).  When you buy, it takes about a week before you have access to the BTC.  After that, sending it to your address, for which you control the private key is quick and straight forward.
They have limits, but my limits have been raised over time.  I remember when the limit was under $500, but then, you could buy a few BTC for that price.

There will be bail ins, more bail outs, price controls, wage controls, outright confiscation of wealth and property...
Nobody can confiscate Bitcoin (if you store it properly).  Nobody can devalue Bitcoin by creating trillions of BTC from thin air.  They CAN, HAVE, and WILL continue to create fiat currencies by the trillions, then hundred trillions, then...  well, look at Venezueal, or the Weimar Republic or any of the many examples history provides.

 When somebody posts any kind of Technical Analysis here...
Stop and think.
What is the purpose of TA? To show us where the price has been lately? No. We can just look at a chart and see it - no analysis needed. Is the purpose to tell us the current price? No. We can look at various "tickers" and see the current price - no analysis needed. The purpose is to **predict near-term price changes.** In other words, "predict the future".
What is the point of trying to predict the future? To make money.
Can TA predict the future well enough to allow people to use it to make money? Suppose it could, if you knew the right technique to employ. Suppose you figure out such a technique, and it works reliably. What are you going to do? I can tell you, my heart would be pounding with excitement and the **last thing I would do about it** is tell anybody. Certainly, I'm not going to go blab it onto the Internet! Seriously!
The reality is this. There is no such thing as TA which can reliably predict the future. Nobody beats the overall market average over the long run. "*Extrapolation is seldom an accurate predictor."*
Here's a **second thing worth considering**. Speaking of long run average... the value of Bitcoin has more than doubled per year, on average, long term. I see no reason for this overall trend to end. I do see reasons for it to continue, but that's a different topic for a different post.
With returns like what we've been seeing, long term, who needs to predict tomorrow's price, or next week's price? Idiots, that's who. For Bitcoin investing, TA is useless, even IF it works. If doubling your money every year isn't good enough for you, you're fucked up, and earning at an even higher rate isn't going to satisfy you -- your problems lie elsewhere.
If, on the other hand, doubling your net worth every year (on average) is good enough for you, then just **buy and hold Bitcoin** \- no analysis needed. No risky trading. No trading fees.

By the way, there are hundreds of ounces of "paper gold" for every ounce of physical gold.  Will this end well?  History says, "no."

Bitcoin is a ledger.
The ledger is just a list of every Bitcoin transaction - ever.  A transaction is when some amount of Bitcoin "money" gets sent from one account to another.
The Bitcoin ledger is stored in copies in computers spread all over the world.  Anybody who wants to can get a copy.  The computers all keep each other up-to-date with the latest additions to the ledger.
To prevent double spending (like writing bad checks), miners use computers to do a bunch of math to protect the ledger, to make it immutable so cheaters don't get away with anything.
Bitcoin is good.  Your Bitcoin "money" cannot be confiscated by any banker or government.  The number of Bitcoins is limited - this is good.  Bitcoin "money" has all the properties necessary to be "sound money" like gold.  Unlike gold, Bitcoin can be sent over the Internet.

Somehow, statements like that make me automatically conclude that the opposite is probably true.
Anyhow, the answer to your question boils down to **trust.**  Specifically, trusting third parties, even central "authorities".  In case you haven't noticed, you can't trust the government, you can't trust the big/central banks, etc.
Somebody like Tether **claims** things, but you and I really have no way of knowing -- use them and you just have to believe.  Faith.  Meanwhile, there's Bitcoin, where people can transact with other people and there is no need to trust the other party, no need to trust any third party or crooked central authority.

No need to trade.  Like gambling, trading has risks and costs.  Eventually the risks and costs win, and the frequent trader ends up broke.
Just buy and hold.  Over the last 5 years, for example, the price of Bitcoin has more than doubled per year on average.  If that's not a good enough return on your investment, then you're either very foolish or mentally ill or something.  At this time I can see no reason for that long term trend to change.

We have a small group (central bankers) with the sole ability to create all the fiat "play money" they want.

There is actual wealth, and then there is money.  When a government or central bank creates more money, it does not create new wealth, but it redistributes wealth -- this is a form of theft.  It is also why the rest of us are not allowed to create USD (counterfeiting).

First thing: Welcome to Bitcoin!
Second thing: you mention "making money".  Bitcoin  **IS**  money.  Bitcoin is a new ***kind*** of money, superior to "money" as you and most people have come to know it.
With Bitcoin, therefore, you can preserve and protect your **wealth**, long term.  The government cannot confiscate your wealth parked in Bitcoin; neither can criminal banksters.
Mining: there are costs - the rig(s) and (mostly) the electricity to operate the rig(s), plus cooling.  Meanwhile, there is competition - other miners, from all over the globe.  Some of them are located where electricity is relatively inexpensive and/or the climate offers "free or low cost cooling".  You might make money, you might end up spending more than you earn.  So, investigate before investing heavily.

It hawked worthless mortgages to dozens of unions and state pension funds, draining them of hundreds of millions in value. And when it wasn’t ripping off workers and pensioners, it was helping to push insurance giants like AMBAC into bankruptcy by fraudulently inducing them to spend hundreds of millions insuring those same worthless mortgages.

Actually, Bitcoin ***can*** do things "your money" cannot.
Meanwhile, "your money," that is, fiat currency is inherently worthless, backed by nothing, and legally counterfeited at will by your central bank.  See that inflation in Venezuela?  Yeah.  Coming soon to "your money".
Also, "your money" can be taken from you during the next financial crisis.  It's called a "bail in".  Bet you never heard of that.  Before putting too much faith in "your money," I suggest learning about bail ins, bail outs, debt monetization, inflation, and fiat currency collapse.
It's your financial future (or lack thereof).  It is your responsibility.  You will enjoy, or suffer, the consequences of what you decide to do or not do at this point.

It hawked worthless mortgages to dozens of unions and state pension funds, draining them of hundreds of millions in value. And when it wasn’t ripping off workers and pensioners, it was helping to push insurance giants like AMBAC into bankruptcy by fraudulently inducing them to spend hundreds of millions insuring those same worthless mortgages.

The Trezor will be able to provide you with an "address" to send BTC ***to***.
On the phone, you'll tell the software, "I wand to **send** (or **spend**)."  It should allow you to enter the "address" you got from the Trezor.  Be very careful.  If you screw up, it's your fault, and your money is gone forever and nobody will help you because nobody can help you.  So be careful to enter the numbers correctly.
Depending on your phone's software and the hardware wallet's software, the Trezor might present you with a QR code which you can aim your phone camera at.  I don't know.  
The thing is, take your time, be careful.  Consider sending a very small amount ($20) the first time to make sure you're able to work everything correctly.

Miners are going to mine, whether you use Bitcoin or not.  If you don't, kleptocrats and/or central bankers will expropriate (steal) your savings.  So, you might as well use Bitcoin and enjoy it.
If you are truly that concerned for the environment, you are barking up the wrong tree by even thinking about Bitcoin, which uses a small fraction of one percent of all power -- you have much "bigger fist to fry" before Bitcoin mining even shows up at the bottom of your list.

You live in "make believe" land.

I was brainwashed too, and still am, but to a much smaller degree, and I'm still working to un-brainwash my mind after many years....
It's okay to be brainwashed - just about everybody around you is.  It's not okay to find out that you're brainwashed and go on doing nothing about it.
I suggest, turn off your TV.  Even better, get rid of it.  After a few months you'll begin to wonder why you ever had one and then you'll feel sad about how much of your precious TIME got wasted, sitting in front of it.

It's both right now.
When there are two currencies in circulation, people are going to spend the "weaker" of the two and "hodl" the "stronger".  Bitcoin is BY FAR the stronger.
Shall we use gold coins for parking meters and vending machines?   Would that not be foolish?
Eventually, most of this fiat crap money will collapse on its own, due to its inherent flaws.  After that happens, I can envision a world where Bitcoin is used like gold and we'll either have the Lightning Network implemented and matured or we can use silver coins (for example) for smaller, face-to-face (cup of coffee) kinds of transactions.
Right now, Bitcoin IS being used.  Some are spending it.  Others are holding it (which is a valid and important use for it -- like gold, for example).






Two things: 1. You'll be a millionaire (probably multi trillionaire) measured in USD (or what ever fucked up fiat you prefer to compare it to) because Bitcoin's purchasing power will increase while the purchasing power of the fiat will flop and fail.
2.  Let's say I had enough money saved up for a nice car, way back when I first discovered Bitcoin.  Suppose I used that money to buy a pile of BTC, and kept farting around in my old, worn out car.  Now, today even, that pile of Bitcoin will buy a small parking lot full of nice, new cars.  Eventually, those same BTC should buy a nice home, a couple of apartment buildings, and a yacht.
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:34:31

@_date: 2018-08-20 21:55:34
When somebody posts any kind of Technical Analysis here...
Stop and think.
What is the purpose of TA? To show us where the price has been lately? No. We can just look at a chart and see it - no analysis needed. Is the purpose to tell us the current price? No. We can look at various "tickers" and see the current price - no analysis needed. The purpose is to predict near-term price changes. In other words, "predict the future".
What is the point of trying to predict the future? To make money.
Can TA predict the future well enough to allow people to use it to make money? Suppose it could, if you knew the right technique to employ. Suppose you figure out such a technique, and it works reliably. What are you going to do? I can tell you, my heart would be pounding with excitement and the last thing I would do about it is tell anybody. Certainly, I'm not going to go blab it onto the Internet! Seriously!
The reality is this. There is no such thing as TA which can reliably predict the future. Nobody beats the overall market average over the long run. "Extrapolation is seldom an accurate predictor."
Here's a second thing worth considering. Speaking of long run average... the value of Bitcoin has more than doubled per year, on average, long term. I see no reason for this overall trend to end. I do see reasons for it to continue, but that's a different topic for a different post.
With returns like what we've been seeing, long term, who needs to predict tomorrow's price, or next week's price? Idiots, that's who. For Bitcoin investing, TA is useless, even IF it works. If doubling your money every year isn't good enough for you, you're fucked up, and earning at an even higher rate isn't going to satisfy you -- your problems lie elsewhere.
If, on the other hand, doubling your net worth every year (on average) is good enough for you, then just buy and hold Bitcoin - no analysis needed. No risky trading. No trading fees.
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:47:31
That's nice.
Still, "extrapolation is seldom an accurate predictor."  Maybe this is one of those "seldom" exceptions?  Maybe not?
I personally believe that Bitcoin will continue going up in value over the long term, for various reasons, including, but not limited to:
* Bankster activities
* Government debt
* Personal debt
* Inherent flaws in fiat currencies
* Human nature
* Bitcoin's design and implementation
* Bitcoin's potential for global adoption

Get out of debt. Stay out of debt. Save an emergency (liquid) cash cushion - enough to pay all your bills for one full year (two years, even better). Then save your investing money.
Don't invest money you can't afford to either lose altogether or to have underwater/upside-down/locked up for a year or two (you don't want to be forced to sell at a loss). Do not borrow money to invest.
Don't put all your eggs into just one or two "baskets".
Carefully consider risks vs rewards.
Don't invest heavily in anything you don't understand.
Don't think you can "beat the market" by trading frequently - you can't. Nobody can. Ignore people with their "technical analysis". Buy and hold. Have an exit plan before you invest ("I'll sell X amount when this happens, or else I'll sell all of it if that other thing happens."
Stocks: consider an S&amp;P500 index fund, then let it sit until you get old.
Gold: don't buy "paper gold," only buy physical gold that YOU store; get an ultrasonic thickness gauge and learn how to detect gold coated tungsten before investing heavily in gold.
Bitcoin: get some, then send it to a wallet for which YOU control the KEYs. Learn about securing your keys and keeping secure back ups and such before you invest significant amounts. Remember: Not your keys, not your Bitcoin." Don't get ripped off, phished, or hacked.
Real estate: most people think they understand it. Very few actually do. It's highly overrated and has considerable risks. Better to get rich, then buy real estate than to plan on getting rich by purchasing real estate.
Keep some cash handy for those rare occasions when a fantastic deal comes your way. Still, remember, if it sounds too good to be true...
Most of all BE PATIENT and don't be stupid.

I use Bitcoin Core.  I heard Bread Wallet is good for a phone, depending on your phone.
Your BTC will be safe because it is stored in the Blockchain, which is just a fancy Ledger.  That Ledger exists on many thousands of computers all over the planet.  That Ledger is protected by strong cryptography and a very clever protocol.
So, you Bitcoin is not only stored on your computer - but all over the globe.  However, only the person with the PRIVATE KEY gets to spend it.  That's why it's important to keep the Private Key a secret.  Not only that, but when you accumulate a lot of Bitcoin, you'll want to make secure back up copies.
For now, to get started, all you need is a free wallet.  Bitcoin Core is good, for example:

After much thought, I've concluded that most people go about their lives **as if things will always be the same as they are right now**.  Of course, they are wrong.  Still, that appears to me to be the major, underlying assumption.
* They see home prices rise 20% per year and figure they will always go up like that from now on.  They never consider whether it is mathematically sustainable.
* They see the stock markets go up... similar deal.  They **don't** ask, "Is this sustainable?  What about all that QE and ZIRP shit?  What about stock buy-backs?  Gee, it crashed pretty hard in 2007/8/9... did anything get fixed or did they just blow an even bigger bubble?"
I tell them that the shit will hit the fan someday.  Typical response, "It isn't happening right now, so it won't ever happen."

Short answer: two wrongs don't make a right.
More complicated discussion: gold ETFs made sense at first, because gold is expensive to securely transport and store.  Others already have secure vaults with gold sitting in them.  Just change the owner and let the gold sit there.
HOWEVER, rehypothecation comes along.  Now we have hundreds of ounces of "paper gold" for every ounce of real gold, and because of that gold ETFs are also a bad idea.
Bitcoin is not expensive to transport or store securely.
Two bad ideas don't make a good idea.

They can't control Bitcoin.  That's part of Bitcoin's beauty.
If a central bank started buying Bitcoin with "freshly printed" money, then that money would devalue (crash, go towards zero) and the price of the Bitcoin would go up, especially when measured by the "freshly printed" currency.

Just buy and hold.  No trading necessary.  Each trade carries risk(s) and a fee.  Eventually, the risks and fees win - you lose.  So just buy and hold.
I mean, if more than doubling your money year-over-year, long term, on average isn't good enough for you, then money is not the issue, and you should discover what your really issues are, and work on them instead.
You don't want to end up all rich but still miserable inside.

For example, go to:
(You'll have to move your mouse around for several seconds... to generate some randomness.)
After a short while, you'll see a couple of QR codes.
In the green part above those, you'll see "Wallet Details" -- click that.
If you scroll down, you'll see, "How do I make a wallet using dice? What is B6?"   You can click that, and follow the directions.
Basically, roll a die 99 times and write down all the numbers you roll, in the order they're rolled.  Then type those into the "Enter Private Key" text thing at the top of the "wallet details" page.  
It will generate the private key AND the public address for that key.
To send money TO that address is easy.  To send it out can be more work, depending upon your wallet and/or exchange.  You can google, for example, "bitcoin spending paper wallet" or "swiping" instead of spending.
So, that's one way...

If a person is ready, yes, they should buy Bitcoin and hold it for many years.
* Out of debt
* emergency (liquid) cash cushion
* additional funds with which to buy Bitcoin such that:
   * won't need the money for two or more years
   * can afford to actually lose all of that money
Don't buy a significant amount of Bitcoin until you have spent time to learn what it actually is and the basics of how it works.

"Traditional roles" are no longer "good enough".  Traditional roles allow a small number of people to create all the fiat money they want from thin air - backed by nothing - and then use it to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies (like, Goldman Sachs, for example).  They do this at tremendous expense to the rest of us.
Goldman Sachs and their buddies are able to commit serious crimes under the "traditional system" - crimes which would send any of the rest of us to prison for a long, long time.
Bitcoin wasn't invented to carry on the "tradition" of corrupt global banking.  Bitcoin was invented BECAUSE "traditional roles of currency" have been perverted and corrupted. Bitcoin was invented as a way to do commerce and store wealth WITHOUT having to use and/or trust those crooks.
**Good bye, Goldman Sachs**.  In the long run, **nobody will miss you**.

That's bad enough.  But they do so at the expense of the rest of us -- which amounts to theft and fraud.

Beyond my mere opinion, there is the fact that **for every ounce of physical gold, there are hundreds of ounces of "paper gold".**  Supply and demand.  The financial criminals on Wall Street can manipulate the supply by creating "gold" (in quotation marks) from thin air.
By the way, they're about to do the exact same thing to Bitcoin.
Getting back to gold, and the price of gold - another (sad) fact: the density of tungsten is very close to that of gold, rendering the specific gravity tests useless.  It is my understanding that there is now a significant amount of gold-coated tungsten being sold (on the Internet, via coin shops, from banks).  So, this also boosts the apparent supply, but not as much as the financial criminals and their "paper gold" ETFs.

It hawked worthless mortgages to dozens of unions and state pension funds, draining them of hundreds of millions in value. And when it wasn’t ripping off workers and pensioners, it was helping to push insurance giants like AMBAC into bankruptcy by fraudulently inducing them to spend hundreds of millions insuring those same worthless mortgages.

Yeah, it's my fault; I control the price.  You see, I have this lever on my desk, it's wired into a Raspberry Pi which runs the software to change the price... 
Sorry, but my cat, Mr. Squiggly Doodlepants jumped onto my desk and bumped the lever with his foot, causing the price to fall.  I was taking a nap and didn't notice.
As soon as I saw it, I was going to fix it, but the lever broke, so I had to go on eBay to buy a new electrical part.  It took a while to find a good deal - one with FREE SHIPPING, you know?  But it's coming from China, and with free shipping that means it could take a while.  And then, I'll have to hook it up and test it out.

Frequent trading is a good way to end up broke.  Each trade carries risk and expense.  Eventually, the risks and fees win, and the frequent/day trader loses.
Meanwhile, over time, the value of Bitcoin has more than doubled each year (on average, over time).  If that's not a high enough return/yield for you, you're fucked up, stupid, or both.  So, just buy, and hold, and be happy someday that you were patient.

Another good one.  I enjoyed part 1, too.
As far as intrinsic value, I say **all** money has little or no intrinsic value.  This is by design -- the very **nature of money.**
Gold?  Gold's intrinsic value is on par with aluminum, a soft metal which conducts electricity well.  Maybe copper.
In other words, even gold has very little intrinsic value.  Gold's value comes from the fact that it has the properties of sound money: durable, divisible, portable, fungible, recognizable, **scarce**, and difficult to counterfeit.
Keep up the good work!

Actually, there's no need to trade.  Each trade carries risk(s) and fee(s).  Eventually, the accumulation of risks and fees wins, and the day traders are rendered broke.  In other words, frequent trading is foolish.
Here's another reason not to be trading Bitcoin: the long term average yield - over time, on average, the value of Bitcoin more than doubles.  Not, "double your money in only 5 years," rather, "quadruple your money every other year or so."  If returns like that aren't good enough for you, there's something wrong with you and you should find out what it is and work on THAT while you "HODL".
**Again: no need to trade.  Just buy and hold for a few years or more...  be patient.**

Is Bank of America run by known criminals??


...  
Bank of America has systematically ripped off almost everyone with whom it has a significant business relationship, cheating investors, insurers, depositors, homeowners, shareholders, pensioners and taxpayers. It brought tens of thousands of Americans to foreclosure court using bogus, “robo-signed” evidence – a type of mass perjury that it helped pioneer. It hawked worthless mortgages to dozens of unions and state pension funds, draining them of hundreds of millions in value. And when it wasn’t ripping off workers and pensioners, it was helping to push insurance giants like AMBAC into bankruptcy by fraudulently inducing them to spend hundreds of millions insuring those same worthless mortgages.

Frequent (day) traders end up broke in the long run.  Each trade entails **risk** and a **fee**.  Eventually, the risks and fees win.
Meanwhile, people who jut bought and held long-term have seen the value of their Bitcoin more than double per year (long term average).  If that isn't enough yield for you, you're fucked up, really stupid, or both.
So, just buy Bitcoin, put it into a wallet for which you control the private key(s), and be patient.

See?  That money is "locked up," and "controlled" by laws and lawmakers.  That money can be confiscated (and most likely will, in the not-too-distant future).
This is not what Bitcoin is all about.
There are many "issues" with Bitcoin ETFs.  If you think it will drive the price up, think again.  Do some research about "rehypothecation".  See what they did to gold.  There are now hundreds of ounces of paper gold for every ounce of physical gold.  You WANT them to do that to Bitcoin, too?
People who put fiat into "Bitcoin ETFs" will not be buying into any revolution.   They'll be paying FEES to banksters while simultaneously taking on serious risks -- when they could just buy Bitcoin and keep the private keys themselves.

Sadly, we've gone well beyond the point of being able to "vote our way out of" the troubles facing us as a nation.
We have a small group with the sole ability to create USD from thin air - backed by nothing - by merely typing numbers into their computers (that is, they don't have to produce any wealth nor take any risks).  Since around 2007, they've created many Trillions (with a T) and have been using it to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies - at the expense of the rest of us.
Ultra-rich stealing from the poor and middle classes.  How mentally ill is that?
The solution is to stop using their central bank fiat "play money" - as much as possible, start using forms of money they cannot create from nothing: gold, silver coin, Bitcoin, etc.  This cuts off their main supply line and we win.

You don't need to trade on margin, you don't need to trade at all.  You don't need an ETF or mutual fund manager to "own" Bitcoins on your behalf (and charge you fees).  You need to put some BTC aside for your old age, and wait.

Does the supply of Bitcoin go up to match the flood of new "play money"?  No!
So, over time, in the long-term, guess where the price of BTC goes, when measured in fiat?
As the value of fiat goes to zero, the value of BTC goes to infinity.  Before it gets to infinity, we reach the point of "permanent backwardization".  What's that?  Look it up.  That's when we get to the point that fiat is so worthless that nobody will trade "good money" for it -- at ANY price.

I believe there is value in a decentralized, global currency where all are free to participate so long as they obey the rules.
I believe there is value in a deflationary form of money that encourages and rewards savers while discouraging debt slavery.
I believe there is value in money that cannot be easily counterfeited to benefit a few rich criminals at the expense of the rest of us.
I believe there is value in a public, globally distributed, immutable ledger protected by cryptographic proof of work.
I believe there is value in a token-and-blockchain implementation that has the potential for smart contracts to cut out middlemen and streamline  the verification of things like property/asset ownership, chain of custody, etc.
I believe there is value in a form of money that allows ordinary people to protect their savings/wealth from criminal bankers and crooked governments who would otherwise confiscate it or steal it through "money printing".

We still have gold.
* Only FOOLS are buying and holding "paper gold".  Wise people only accept physical gold
* Wise people test every piece of gold they buy; there's a lot of gold plated tungsten out there
* Gold is expensive to securely store and transport
* Gold can be (and has been) confiscated by the government
People deposited their gold in "banks" and the banks loaned it out.  Then there were bank runs.  So, why would people deposit their gold in a bank?  Because gold is expensive to store securely, and the bank has a secure vault.  But the banker ends up robbing you.
Bitcoin allows us to circumnavigate/avoid these bankers.  We can securely store and transport Bitcoin very easily and inexpensively.  Bitcoin cannot be confiscated by force.

Someday there will most likely be "bail ins" where  governments authorizes the criminal bankers to simply TAKE some/all of your savings in order to bail out the ultra-rich (already happened in Cyprus).

Bitcoin protects against that sort of thing, too.
@_date: 2018-06-18 23:52:52


Right.  Which is part of why it is worthless.
Criminal central bankers get to create tens of trillions of dollars worth of their fiat currency "play money" by merely typing numbers into their computers.  That money is backed by nothing.
Nobody can create even one Bitcoin without mining it, without proof of work. Bitcoin cannot be created from "thin air" like fiat currency.

ALL money has little or no intrinsic worth - BY DESIGN.  This includes Bitcoin, gold, and dollar bills.  Most USD, Yen, Yuan, Euros, Pounds, etc. only exist in digital form and those bits have zero "intrinsic worth".  This says that the person/people who wrote this drivel don't understand money.

Let this be a reminder to all:
* Don't invest money you cannot afford to either lose, or to have "upside down" for a long time (a year or two...)
* Don't borrow to invest (get out of debt, stay out of debt).  Maintain a liquid cash cushion
* Don't put all your eggs in one basket; Bitcoin is just one basket.  Consider stocks, cash in the bank, real estate, gold, silver, etc.
* Don't invest heavily in things you don't understand
* Consider risks vs rewards vs your tolerance for volatility...
* Learn what Bitcoin actually is and the very basics of how it works before investing heavily.  Learn to effectively secure your Bitcoins before investing heavily
Having said that, if you have some money to play around with, Bitcoin can be a very fun hobby.  
Also, buy-and-hold has been a very rewarding strategy so far.

No. YOU made an apparently bogus claim which you are not able to back up.
@_date: 2018-06-20 19:48:34
You worked hard on that reply.  I will be respectful of that.
The first paragraph: seems like you're saying we have a "motivation" problem, not an "ability" problem.
To that I say, respectfully, there's some truth to that, however... (yeah, the "but" part)... for example, if I give somebody a pencil, and don't say anything special, then ask them two weeks later, "Hey. Where's that pencil I gave you?"  Some would know, most probably wouldn't, if they're like me.  If I gave them a bar of gold, then asked them two weeks later, I bet most/all of them would know \*exactly\* where it went.
My point here is that with the gold bar, they're motivated to pay attention.
Second paragraph: You're right - because of the safety nets, people are habitually careless.  Good point.  However, learning to keep a 24-word pass phrase safe takes a lot less time, effort, motivation, smarts than, say, becoming a doctor or car mechanic.  Again: motivation is the key (no pun intended).  "Here.  This pass phrase is very important.  Pay attention or you'll lose $X amount of your hard-earned wealth..."  I think most people would figure it out, but it would be unfortunate for the others.  Thus, my suggestion to new people has been, and continues to be, "Buy a small amount of Bitcoin.  Learn how to send it from one address to another.  Learn to watch the transaction with a browser.  Get the feel of things.  Ask questions, learn as you go."  After a while, they'll know how to secure millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin.
The example paragraphs: nicely done.  Very thought provoking.  You raise an interesting issue.
Finally, as to your "how do you convince someone..." question.  I explain that their savings are at risk in the current banking system, then they laugh at me.  Eventually they get robbed by their own bank during the next financial meltdown - like the people in Cyprus a few years ago.  Then it's too late for them.  Seriously, if I knew how to convince people of things, I'd be in SALES.  But I'm not in sales.  LOL.  Oh well.

Bitcoin, on the other hand is a new KIND of money.  Turns out there are very serious problems with the current global banking system and its kind of money.  Bitcoin has been designed from the beginning to avoid those kinds of problems.

The IRS can quickly and easily snatch your savings account, your checking account, etc.  The IRS cannot confiscate your BTC.
To get your BTC, somebody (the IRS in this case) would need to transfer it from your account into theirs; to cause a transaction to happen they would need the Private Key so that the transaction could be digitally signed.
If you don't give them your Private Key, they'll never be able to guess it.  Also, they'll never be able to "force" the rest of the Bitcoin network to given them your money.

Well, then, why not start by learning what Bitcoin actually is, and the very basics of how it works?
Also, consider buying a relatively small amount at first.  Get used to moving it off the exchange into your own wallet.  Learn some of the "ropes".  Send a small amount to a friend, perhaps.
Learn a bit about ways to properly secure your Bitcoin before you invest heavily.
Once you're more comfortable, then you should consider investing more significantly.  
Remember: so far, buy-and-hold has been a very rewarding strategy.

Government, at this point, is part of the problem.
People getting ripped off by scammers?  "A fool and his money are soon parted."  Tough luck.  Don't invest what you can't afford to lose and don't invest heavily in things you don't understand.
Meanwhile, central bankers created tens of trillions of dollars worth of their "play money" from "nothing" and have been using it to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies.
Stop!  Back up.  See that one one word?  "Empower."  Yes, they use some of that money to literally buy politicians (both parties), regulators, judges, etc.  Those clowns ultimately work for the biggest crooks on the plant -- so, let's not turn to them for help.
**Things we should all do:**
1. Learn and teach.  Seek to understand.  Help others to understand.
2. As much as possible, stop using central banker "play money", use things like gold, silver coin, and Bitcoin because the bankers cannot create them at will, from essentially nothing.
3. Take personal responsibility.  Encourage others to do the same.

I like how you carefully define terms, like "cryptocurrency" and "asset" -- but you didn't define "currency".  Some definitions require a government to issue it.  Under those definitions, Bitcoin is not a "currency", but it IS a cryptocurrency.  So, who cares.  It is what it is.
You mention that Bitcoin is not tangible -- but 90 percent or more of USD, for example are digital, and not tangible, and nobody has been bitching or complaining about that.
Bitcoin is money.  Money is an asset.  Money is a currency.  I don't need a long article about that.
Meanwhile, for an article that long, consider, "If the reader doesn't get ANYTHING else from my article, I want them to get THIS."  This is your gold nugget, your bottom line: move the bottom line to the top - it might be the ONLY part of your article (other than the title) which gets read by many people.
Make a bold statement.
Provide a brief executive summary, which supports your statement.

Zero And Negative Interest Rate Policies.
Certain cronies of the central bankers get to borrow hundreds of billions of dollars and either pay zero percent interest, nearly zero percent, or in some cases get paid to borrow money.
Imagine going to your bank:
You, "I'd like to borrow a billion dollars."
Bank, "Okay.  Here you go.  We'll start paying you interest on it and deposit it into your account..."
You go out, make a bad investment, lose part of it...  Go back to the bank and borrow more!

Right now there is a small group with the sole ability to "legally counterfeit" all the fiat "play" money they want.  Since about 2007, the central bankers have created many tens of trillions of dollars worth of their "play" money from thin air by merely typing numbers into the bank computers, and have been using it to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies \-\- at the expense of the rest of us.  They've been buying all manner of actual wealth: real estate, stocks, bonds, commodities, yachts, furs, gems, politicians (both parties), judges, regulators, mass media news outlets... They are thieves.  Criminals.  Scum.  Weak.
If we all switched to gold or silver, they'd have the government confiscate it from us.
Now we have Bitcoin.  They cannot confiscate Bitcoin (unless you're dumb enough to hand over your private keys).  They cannot create Bitcoin from thin air, like they've been doing with their "play money".
Our best way to fight them is to \-\- as much as possible \-\- stop using their "play" money (fiat currencies).

Here's the root of many serious problems:
A small group of people have the sole ability to "legally counterfeit" all the (fiat) money they choose.
That's it.
Those central bankers have created many tens of trillions of dollars worth of their "play money" since about 2007, and they've been using it to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies \-\- at the expense of the rest of us.
What is a dollar?  A general purpose IOU.  So, why do we owe them many tens of trillions of dollars worth of labor and materials and wealth?  We don't.  But they get to just take it from the rest of us by merely typing numbers into their banks' computers to create more "money".
They type numbers, then buy real estate, stocks, gold, politicians, judges, regulators, media outlets, etc.  That's theft.  If we do it, it's illegal, as it ought to be.  When they do it, somehow it's supposed to be okay.
Bitcoin threatens their little game.  They can't just create Bitcoin from thin air.  And they can't confiscate it, like gold or real estate.

1. Crypto has no (intrinsic) value.
That's the whole point of "money," isn't it?  General purpose IOUs: durable, fungible, portable, recognizable, divisible, difficult to counterfeit, scarce.
Meanwhile, the USD has no intrinsic value.  Some are little green rags, but most (90&amp; or more) is just digital bits in the banking system computers, with no intrinsic value.
Gold's intrinsic value is about equal to that of aluminum, for example.  The reason gold is more expensive \-\- it is rare compared to aluminum.

The chart at the 6:30 point... turn it upside down, there's the "cliff" he spoke about shortly before ...
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:01:08
Let's think this through.
We have a small group of people with the sole ability to create all the "money" they want from nothing.  They've been doing so, and have greatly enriched themselves and their cronies to the point they practically own everything.  Along comes Bitcoin, threatening the existence of their system.
They're not going to give up without a try, or two, or three...
Remember, they can create tens of trillions of USD by just typing numbers into a computer.  We can't, but they can.  Is it difficult to imagine them buying and selling Bitcoin in huge "waves" to mess with the price, on purpose, using money that they never had to earn or trade for?
Suppose they're doing just that, and then using the mainstream "(fake) news" outlets they own to have "experts" come on and tell the public, "Oh, look how BAD Bitcoin is \- too much volatility!"  When the price is up, their experts are brainwashing TV viewers with, "It's a bubble, it's a scam..." then they drive the price down and the experts are there explaining how their "analysis" shows no bottom!  OMG!
If that kind of thing is NOT happening, then those central bankers are even DUMBER than I figured.
Meanwhile, ignore the noise, focus on what's real \- the fundamentals: what IS Bitcoin?  how does it work?  Why was it invented?  What's wrong with the current system?  Etc.
@_date: 2018-06-22 02:06:01
Wow.  Did you think I meant money was "literally" created from air, that is our atmosphere? 
Literally, trillions of dollars have been created by merely typing numbers into the banks' computers.
Fiat money is evil and doomed.

@_date: 2018-06-21 12:42:37
No. Fiat is backed by nothing.
Bitcoin has value because it has all the properties of "good money".
1. Durable
2. Divisible
3. Portable
4. Recognizable
5. Fungible
6. Rare/scarce
7. Difficult to counterfeit
Bitcoin also has some functionality as "programmable money".
Fiat money is easily created from thin air by bankers.

@_date: 2018-06-28 20:51:14
First, most people have a mortgage - they don't own the home they live it, they're renting it from the bank (they're renting the money.  If/when they lose their job or encounter a financial hardship, they often lose the home and the money they've invested in it.  This tends to happen most often to people who overpay during a bubble, for example.
Second, there are typically property taxes.
Third, insurance costs.  Liability, fire, flood, earthquake...  Not cheap.
Fourth, maintenance.
Thus, once you've invested in a home, you have to keep pouring money into it.  And there is no guarantee that the value of that property will go up.
Contrast with Bitcoin: Buy it.  Move it into your wallet.  Zero mortgage payments.  Zero tax to let it sit there.  No insurance costs, no maintenance costs.
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:18:45

Gold has all of the properties (characteristics) necessary for something to be good money, namely:
1. Durable
2. Divisible
3. Portable
4. Fungible
5. Recognizable
6. Rare
7. Difficult to counterfeit
The USD is easy to counterfeit, for example, if you happen to be a banker.  So it fails the test.
Xenon gas has all the required properties, except one.  Can you figure it out?
That's right, it is not recognizable.  If I offer you a glass tube filled with a colorless gas, you have no way to know whether it's xenon or pain air.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin  has all 7 properties!  Isn't that great?  Yes, it is!  Bitcoin is a "good money" -- even better than physical gold in many ways, whereas fiat currency is essentially worthless, and doomed.

Here are some real world applications:
No government, IRS, banker, nor crook can steal/confiscate my Bitcoin.
No government can declare a Bitcoin "banking holiday" while their buddies loot the economy.
No government or central banker can create tens of trillions of BTC by merely typing numbers into a computer.
No metal detector or search by any "guard" at any airport or border, no highway robber nor pirate on the ocean can "find and take" my Bitcoin as I travel about.
No d-head loser can stop me from sending BTC to other people around the world.
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:20:17

What makes something like gold and/or Bitcoin a form of "good money"?  It has these seven properties: Durable, divisible, fungible, recognizable, portable, rare, and difficult to counterfeit.
As you can see, "fiat" money is not a form of "good money".
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:42:20

Currently, there is a small group of people (central bankers) with the sole ability to create all the fiat currency (play money) they want from thin air.  Since about 2007, they've created many tens of trillions of USD worth of fiat, and have been using it to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies at the expense of the rest of us.  Soon they will crash their evil system again.
Bitcoin cannot be created from thin air and our accounts cannot be confiscated.
Once the banking criminals are forced to play by fair rules, they will fail.  When they fail, there won't be endless loans of fiat money to finance endless and needless wars and other global atrocities.

Here's where you go wrong:
Not everybody "entering BTC" understands it, not all of them are HODLERS.  Some of them are new, they know/knew very little.  Some are short term speculators.  Some are HODLERs.  Some are not.  Some know a lot, already own BTC and bought more.

Let this be a reminder: Don't leave significant Bitcoin or fiat sitting around on ANY exchange.
Don't store significant amounts of BTC on any smart phone.
Don't store significant amounts of BTC on any computer connected to the Internet.
Learn about paper wallets, hardware wallets - carefully consider how you control/store your private keys.
Be sure to keep your private keys backed up (and securely encrypted) at an second location in case of fire, flood, etc.
Remember: exchanges get hacked all the time.  Now this...

It allows people to exchange one form of money for another, for a fee (of course).
Every time a person walks past a Bitcoin ATM, the image goes into their brain and stays there.  As a result, some people become curious, then they do a bit of research, they learn the truth, and then they become Bitcoin proponents.

Do you mean "y'all"?
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:38:43
Exactly.  Just a few minutes ago, somebody asked me to ELI5, I replied:
Bitcoin is just a ledger.
Your bank uses ledgers. Employers use ledgers. Maybe you use them to do your book keeping.
Bitcoin only exists within it's ledger, that is, there are no physical coins, paper bills, or shiny rocks, just numbers on that ledger. The ledger keeps track of every bit of Bitcoin ever created and/or sent from one account to another.
But the ledger is useful because it is public, global, IMMUTABLE, and protected by cryptographic proof of work (mining). So, why not just have a ledger, and forget about the Bitcoin part?
Because the miners are motivated by rewards and fees, and those rewards and fees are \-\- ta da \-\- Bitcoin. Remove the Bitcoin, you remove the reward, you remove the motivation (mining is very expensive). Remove the mining and you remove the protection. Remove the protection and suddenly your ledger is no longer IMMUTABLE... When you have a public ledger that's not protected, not immutable, anybody can say whatever they want on it, or rewrite "history". There is no "truth" and therefore no "trust" \-\- you end up with a big pile of garbage.
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:12:20
Yes.  Physical gold, for example.
Somebody takes it, it's gone.  Poof.
When you have significant wealth stored in Bitcoin, for example, you suddenly have a powerful motivation to not lose it all.  This isn't like, "Where did tweet go?" for example.
Taking personal responsibility is a good thing.
@_date: 2018-06-21 01:42:48
We would go back to fundamentals: revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, management,etc. would drive most/all of the prices instead of bubble prices fueled by cheap debt pushed by criminal central bankers.

@_date: 2018-06-14 22:31:59
Okay.  Sorry about any confusion I caused.
I mean competition as far as technology, not price.
IMO, what we need is for the general public to have a better understanding of the truth about Bitcoin (and other crypto).  It might help if more people knew what Bitcoin actually is, and the very basics of how it works.  Also, knowing about why it was invented would help people to see that it is a good thing, an anti-scam.

You can "park" that wealth in Bitcoin, for example, where it is "safe" from the banksters.

Just two quick examples (of many possible):






No. Sorry, no need to understand the mechanics of Bitcoin in order to buy.  Instead, tell them how to buy Bitcoin.  I'd put a bullet list, then describe each item on that list in separate paragraphs.

Just because you haven't bothered to take a bit of time to learn what Bitcoin actually is, nor the basics of how it works, that doesn't make it a "religion".  It's a new technology, a new kind of money.
Why won't you go learn about it (sooner than later)?  Knowledge is power!  I'll say this, I haven't met even ONE person who spent the effort to learn about it that wish they hadn't.

Bitcoin is a ledger of transactions.  A transaction is when somebody sends BTC (coin) from one account to another.
The ledger exists simultaneously on a large number of computers spread all over the world.  Bitcoin has been carefully designed to thwart would-be cheaters.  In a nutshell, Bitcoin "miners" protect the integrity of the ledger by using special cryptography (math); their work is rewarded with new Bitcoins and fees.  Typically, the fees are small.
No banker, no government, no criminal can create BTC from thin air.  This makes Bitcoin more like gold, and **not** like mere fiat currency.
You will use your computer to generate a **private key** (a long random number).  Computed from that private key will be your **public key, or Bitcoin "address"**.  The address is like a unique bank account number.  You can then buy BTC from an exchange, or from a private individual, and have them (the exchange or individual) send your BTC to your account (public key).
**KEEP YOUR PRIVATE KEY SECURE.**  The private key is used when you want to send BTC from your account to another account - your private key will be used to "prove" (via digital signature) that you own that account.  Anybody who discovers your private key can spend your Bitcoin. \[Do not lose your private key, if you do your BTC in that account will be gone forever.\]
Since the ledger is public (remember the ledger?), you'll be able to watch it, with a browser, as the miners process the blocks...

It goes up and down and sideways.
It would not surprise me to find out that the big/central banks were messing with the price just to frighten people away, and/or give them something negative to say about it, "The price is too volatile, blah blah blah..."
A year ago it was $3000 per BTC.
Of course its volatile \- it's still relatively new and it's disruptive AND it attracted a lot of speculators who lack much understanding during the run\-up towards the end of last year.
Remember: NOTHING GOT FIXED in the banking system / financial markets after the 2007/8 disaster; criminal central bankers just created a bunch of money (many tens of trillions of USD worth) from thin air, used it to enrich and empower themselves and their selected cronies, then blew even bigger asset bubbles in stocks, bonds, housing, etc.  WHEN these bubbles pop (and they always do), the magnitude of the ensuing crises will dwarf 2007/8... will dwarf 1929...  We will see the death of fiat currency, and those with wealth to preserve and/or transfer will turn to Bitcoin.
Compared to that, today's little price wiggle is just "noise".  Focus on the big "signal".

"From what I'm seeing people are looking at the wrong thing..."
Yes, I agree w/ what you wrote.  I appreciate that you took the time.
I've given this a lot of thought, and done my own research and have connected the dots to my own satisfaction and here is my conclusion:
**As much as possible, we the people should stop using central banker "play money" and use forms of "good money" such as gold, silver coin, and Bitcoin.**
Why? 
Because we have a small group with the sole ability to create as many USD as they want, from nothing, backed by nothing.  Since about 2007 they've created many Trillions (with a T) of dollars and have been using them to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies -- at the expense of the rest of us.  This is theft, by the way.
They steal from us, then use the wealth to "buy" politicians, judges, regulators, etc. from both political parties.  They buy stocks, bonds, commodities, yachts, mansions, private jets, etc.  And they own much of the mass media.  **Television, for example.**  Their only power comes from their ability to legally counterfeit money.  When we stop using their "play money" they instantly lose power.
**Hooray for Bitcoin - Power to The People!**

Instead, ask yourself what gives Bitcoin any value at all.
 I Believe there is Value in Bitcoin
I believe there is value in a decentralized, global currency where all are free to participate so long as they obey the rules.
I believe there is value in a deflationary form of money that encourages and rewards savers while discouraging debt slavery.
I believe there is value in money that cannot be easily counterfeited to benefit a few rich criminals at the expense of the rest of us.
I believe there is value in a public, globally distributed, immutable ledger protected by cryptographic proof of work.
I believe there is value in a token-and-blockchain implementation that has the potential for smart contracts to cut out middlemen and streamline the verification of things like property/asset ownership, chain of custody, etc.
I believe there is value in a form of money that allows ordinary people to protect their savings/wealth from criminal bankers and crooked governments who would steal it through "money printing" or outright confiscation.

I've never heard of Breadwallet.
Can't you send directly from Coinbase to sportsbook?  Seems to me that sportsbook, whatever that is, would provide you with a Bitcoin "address" to send some BTC (Bitcoin) to.  It would look something like 13Gn5Q6ReYeWADqRUSBzKsn6QEHGQsEJZz, for example
You would use that "address" (copy and paste to avoid typos) to "send" BTC from Coinbase, for example.
Similarly, if you use a wallet, your wallet should provide you with a "receive address" that you can "send" BTC to from Coinbase.  Don't leave much money (BTC or fiat) sitting around on Coinbase any longer than necessary, just in case.

Bitcoin is just a ledger.
Your bank uses ledgers.  Employers use ledgers.  Maybe you use them to do your book keeping.
Bitcoin only exists within it's ledger, that is, there are no physical coins, paper bills, or shiny rocks, just numbers on that ledger.  The ledger keeps track of every bit of Bitcoin ever created and/or sent from one account to another.
But the ledger is useful because it is public, global, IMMUTABLE, and protected by cryptographic proof of work (mining).  So, why not just have a ledger, and forget about the Bitcoin part?
Because the miners are motivated by rewards and fees, and those rewards and fees are \-\- ta da \-\- Bitcoin.  Remove the Bitcoin, you remove the reward, you remove the motivation (mining is very expensive).  Remove the mining and you remove the protection.  Remove the protection and suddenly your ledger is no longer IMMUTABLE...  When you have a public ledger that's not protected, not immutable, anybody can say whatever they want on it, or rewrite "history".  There is no "truth" and therefore no "trust" \-\- you end up with a big pile of garbage.

* What Bitcoin actually is
* The basics of how Bitcoin works

@_date: 2018-06-13 04:49:59
Creating a paper wallet is free.
See "[bitaddress.org](  Generate one or more private keys.  Each private key has its associated public key.  "Send" your BTC to one or more of the public key "addresses" associated with your private key(s).
Store them off\-line, to protect yourself against hackers.  You can store them on a computer that never gets connected to the Internet, for example.  You can write them down (double\-check for accuracy).  You can print them out.  
Keep a backup copy in a secure, remote location to protect against fire/flood, etc.
If you store the private keys on, say, "thumb drives" you can (and should) encrypt them first \-\- use a long and strong password and keep a hint or two to help you remember that password.
If you don't control the private keys, you really don't own the Bitcoins \- you're trusting somebody else, and you're just asking for it.
Again, keep the private keys secure and safe (and in two or more locations) \-\- if you lose them or forget the password you'll lose the Bitcoins forever.

First of all, Welcome to Bitcoin.  Welcome to "the sub".
"Digital money": Most money is already digital.  Over 90 percent of USD, for example, exists in digital form.
"Money to be made": The central bankers can make all the fiat money they want by merely typing a few numbers into their computers.  Since about 2007, they've create many tens of trillions of USD worth of their "play money" and have been using it to enrich and empower themselves (and their cronies) at our expense.  This is theft.  Fiat money is backed by nothing and doomed to eventually collapse, just like in Venezuela, for example.
Bitcoin cannot be created "from thin air".  Bitcoin must be mined, which requires specialized equipment and electrical power - costs and time.  The amount of Bitcoin is limited, unlike fiat.
Bitcoin is decentralized, by design.  It's for people who are willing to take care of themselves, willing and able to secure their own wealth by managing their own private keys.  If you have "bitcoin" in a brokerage account, you don't own sh**.  They can still steal your wealth and/or confiscate it.

Temporary fluctuations.
I know how you feel.  I've ridden out a few "cycles".  It helps to see the big picture, beyond Bitcoin's price, beyond Bitcoin, beyond cryptocurrency, beyond your own country.  Learn what money actually is.  Then learn about fractional reserve banking.  Then learn the reality of central banks.  Learn how the central bankers and their cronies/bosses are the ones who are really in control - not congress, not the president...  (Please: don't just take my word for it; do your own diligent research.)
Once you can "see" for yourself a bigger picture of the world and global finance with respect to history -- you should have a very deep appreciation for the "miracle" of Bitcoin and where this is all heading.  In comparison, today's price fluctuations are mere "noise" compared to a strong "signal".
On the other hand, if you just want to use Bitcoin to increase your near-term supply of fiat currency "play money" -- you're missing out on the biggest financial, social, and humanitarian opportunity of your entire lifetime.

For me, there are seven (not six) properties/characteristics necessary for "good money":
1. Durable
2. Divisible
3. Recognizable
4. Portable.
5. Fungible
6. Rare
7. Difficult to counterfeit
I suppose you could make a case that if it isn't difficult to counterfeit, then it won't be rare.

We have a small group with the sole ability to create all the USD they want from thin air by merely typing numbers into their computers.  Since about 2007 they have created many trillions of USD, and have been using those trillions to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies.  These people are now above the law.
For instance, if you or I commit fraud, we get arrested and we go to jail.  Not them.  Their 'bank' pays a relatively small 'fine'.  No bankers went to jail as a result of the prior financial meltdown, though thousands should have.
These bankers and cronies happen to own much of the mass media, which they have been using to tell us that they are the "elite".  There is nothing "elite" about robbing the poor with your "money printing" -- these people are criminals.
The US has been, and is being slowly and silently overthrown by criminal bankers.  You won't hear it on TV because they own and control most of what you'll see there.
The best way to fight back is to stop using their "play money" which is created from thin air and backed by nothing.  Instead, use things like gold, silver coin, and Bitcoin -- they cannot create these things from thin air.

The trade war is a symptom of the currency war which has been unfolding for years.
The currency war is a symptom of people using "bad money" (fiat central bank currencies) on a global scale.
Let's take the USD, for example.  How can it be a store of value when some criminal "banker" is allowed to create tens of trillions of dollars by merely typing numbers into a computer?
What does history tell us about fiat currencies?  They always die.
"But the USD isn't dead!"  That's right, but it is DYING right before your eyes, and the trade war is just one symptom of that...

Sort of.  They rely upon the central bankers being able to create trillions of dollars from nothing, backed by nothing, and then 'lending' it to cronies (like Buffet, Dimon, ...) at (nearly) zero percent interest.  This amounts to theft from the rest of us.  It also usurps free markets, as winners and losers are being chosen by a few "criminal bankers".
Bitcoin, like physical gold, cannot be created from thin air by merely typing numbers into a bank's computer.

If you want to be ultra-paranoid (which isn't nec. a bad thing, when dealing w/ significant amounts of Bitcoin/crypto), consider generating your private keys, off-line, on a machine that will never be connected to the Internet.  Then put those private keys into a text file, encrypt that text file and copy it to **two** micro SD chips, which should be relatively easy to hide, and delete the plaintext key file from the machine where you generated them, in case somebody breaks into your home and steals it.  Keep a file or two of the plaintext public keys.
Now, since you're ultra-paranoid, store the second copy in a physically separate, yet secure location.  **Don't lose the password you used to encrypt the text file with your private keys!**
Now, just send your Bitcoins to your off-line private keys, using the public addresses.
Note: this is the old-fashioned ultra-paranoid way.  Maybe buying a hardware wallet is safe enough for you.

If you can see the big picture, the big vision of cryptocurrencies and their blockchains -- and -- the big mess the current global banking system has gotten itself into, then Bitcoin starts to look like the great long-term asset to be holding.
Suppose, for example, that you KNEW there was going to be a huge flood.  You buy a boat, then the price of boats goes down.  But you KNOW that the flood is coming... Just a matter of time.  That's how it is for me.  This "boat" is going to save my \*ss when SHTF - and it will be worth every penny.

Now you're here telling us how great Bitcoin ETFs are and how the economy is fine...
The economy is not fine.  For example, we've been stuck on/near zero percent interest rates (for certain crony billionaires) -- ZIRP.  That's not normal; there is nothing healthy about it.  Similarly, ten years of "QE".  Nothing good or healthy about that, either.  Look at the GINI coefficient for the US -- we ought to be ASHAMED of ourselves as a nation.  Since about 2007, central banks have STOLEN tens of trillions of dollars worth of wealth from the rest of us by creating fiat "money" from literally nothing, backed by nothing.
Now we have new "echo" bubbles in stocks, housing, bonds, commodities... we have a student loan crises, and we even have a "used car sub-prime loan bubble".

Why don't you learn what Bitcoin actually is, and the basics of how it works, instead?
@_date: 2018-06-20 14:00:40
First, Bitcoin is not too complex for normal people to own and use.  Look into "hardware wallets" for example.  
So, you're also incorrect to say that there is a "need for custodians".  If you're mentally disabled, then, yes, you need somebody else to look after your finances - this is true whether Bitcoin exists or not.  Most people don't need that.
Second, the government could tell the exchanges to hand over their private keys.  They already did this in Italy, or so I've been told.  This is why you **always store your Bitcoins in a private key that you (and you alone) control**.  Do not store significant amounts of BTC or fiat on any exchange.  That's not the purpose of the exchange.
Would you store gold bars/coins in your mailbox?  I sure hope not!  Similarly, don't store Bitcoin on any exchange.
How to avoid storing BTC on an exchange?  Either generate your own private key and send them to the corresponding public address, or just buy a good hardware wallet and RTFM.
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:34:31
Do not invest heavily in things you do not understand.
Having said that, a good way to learn is to invest a relatively small amount and do research (sort of like what you're doing now, by asking here).
You can buy Bitcoin from an exchange, but don't leave large amounts of Bitcoin or fiat money sitting on an exchange (that's one way to make sure you're money stays safe).
Learn about private keys (they protect your Bitcoins, so you need to protect them).  Transfer your Bitcoin from the exchange into your private key(s).
Learn what Bitcoin actually is, and the basics of how it works.  This will put you way ahead of the average person.
When you know what private keys are, what they're for, and how to secure them yourself, you'll be ready to invest larger amounts.

It's your wealth.  It's your responsibility to learn a few relatively simple things to secure your wealth.
Seriously: "Here's you pass phrase.  Don't let anybody else know it.  Don't lose it.  Keep a secure backup copy.  Even better, memorize it."
If that's too complicated for you, then maybe you have more serious issues...
@_date: 2018-06-16 00:07:53
Fair enough.
I suppose if I bought a significant amount and paid $15K or more, I'd be saying words like "crashing".

He's deceptive.  He's gently pushing the idea the JP Morgan (or whichever TBTF institution) can hold your money and invest in crypto for you.
Don't fall for it.  Unless you and you alone control the private key, you don't really own sh\*t, you're a sucker.
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:42:07
You and your "loaded questions".  Sorry, man, I'm not in the mood for loaded questions and other logical fallacies right now.  Maybe later.

So, you don't know, either.  You might be right.  Okay.  Have a nice evening!

Bottom line: Keep presenting the truth, the facts.
We are still in the very early stages of Bitcoin.
If FUD could kill it, Bitcoin would have died by now.
I guarantee you -- the more you learn about the evil corruption within the central banking system, within the stock markets, within the mainstream "news" media, within government, the more "miraculous" Bitcoin becomes to you.  When you reach that point, if you haven't already, you may start to feel sorry for those who focus almost entirely on the short-term price fluctuations.
We have the truth on our side.  The truth has a certain "ring" to it, it resonates with most people and it irritates the liars and sociopaths -- so keep telling the truth.
Remember: when somebody says some BS about it, politely and calmly respond with the truth.  If they start bickering with you, then that's too bad for them.  Our task is not to win every "debate" with every uninformed person, rather to encourage them to consider that they don't know shit about what they're talking about.
For example, somebody blurts out, "Bitcoin is stupid!"  You might ask them, calmly/politely/respectfully, "Do you know what Bitcoin actually IS?  Do you understand the basics of how it works?"   Most people don't.  (If you can't explain the answers to a 5 year old or your grandmother, then, dammit dude, you need to learn...)  If they can't admit they don't know, you're dealing with an idiot -- never argue with an idiot.  If they admit they really don't know, you have an opportunity to suggest that if they DID understand, they'd see all the goodness and long-term potential in Bitcoin.  Encourage them to go learn (on their own).

The intrinsic value of gold is about on par with aluminum.
@_date: 2018-06-20 13:07:38
Gold has characteristics that make it "good money".  Good money has **all** of the following characteristics:
1. Durable (does not rust or rot)
2. Divisible
3. Fungible
4. Portable
5. Recognizable
6. **Rare**
7. **Difficult to counterfeit**
Bitcoin has all of those characteristics.

Imagine a particular story.  You've read the book, not once but twice.  You've seen the movie.  In fact, you even played one of the story's characters in a play - so you're intimately familiar with the plot details.
Along comes some crazy person making bogus claims about that story.  Would you not be able to instantly see that they have no idea what they're talking about?
If you knew much about Bitcoin, you'd be able to see how stupid/crazy your post looks.

Two things:
1. We, the Bitcoin community, have a tremendous opportunity to educate young people about what Bitcoin actually is, the basics of how it works...
2. It would be even more fun to ask people of all ages what they know about "money", fiat currency, fractional reserve banking, central banking, gold standards, how money is created/destroyed, questions about debt, debt-to-GDP ratios, home-price-to-income ratios...  Why would this be "more fun"?  Because money is not new, like Bitcoin, yet most people have little or no clue about it.
For example, I've had a lot of fun asking "gold bugs," what backs gold.  Most of them have wrong answers.
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:26:45

Every dollar bill has a serial number, but it's still fungible because one dollar is as good as another.
If you go buy wool socks with Bitcoin, to the seller, Bitcoin is Bitcoin -- that's fungibility.
"In economics, fungibility is the property of a good or a commodity whose individual units are essentially interchangeable. For example, since one kilogram of pure gold is equivalent to any other kilogram of pure gold, whether in the form of coins, ingots, or in other states, gold is fungible."

**One Million Dollars per minute...**

Do you want to hold "digital gold" or central banker "play money"?
Have patience.  Look at the long term.
Know that there are some very serious problems in the current banking system.  Money as we have come to know it (central banker fiat currency) is about to die an ignominious death.
Learn about what happened in places like Venezuela, Argentina, Zimbabwe, the former Soviet Union, 1920's Germany.  Learn: You can't "print" prosperity.
Remember 2007/8/9?  The financial calamity?  Well, nothing got fixed \- instead, they've just blown even bigger debt bubbles, which will eventually pop.

@_date: 2018-06-16 21:28:56
Bottom line: does it matter?
The idea behind Bitcoin, you don't have to **trust** a **central authority**.
Along comes an exchange, then another, and another.   Remember Mt. Gox?  Anyhow, it turns out you can't really trust an exchange.
So, along comes some government regulator.  You mean, like the guys who were keeping an eye on the banks in 2006 and 2007?  Those guys are lame... worse than useless.  They work for huge, bureaucratic central authorities, the kind we set out to **not** trust.  Hence, my question: what difference does it make?

No problem with lending money for profit.

When it comes to central bank fiat currency, we have a small group with the sole ability to create as much as they want, from nothing, backed by nothing; it's just play money, created at will without work or risk by the central bankers, by the trillions, to greatly enrich and empower themselves at your expense.
I'd like to encourage you to learn about that kind of thing, learn about the unfair, corrupt form of money that Bitcoin is replacing.  Learn about all the other fiat currencies in history -- fiat money always goes to zero.
You might say, "Not mine," but you're deluding yourself.  There are serious problems with fiat money -- they're your problems whether you realize/acknowledge it or not.

Beanie babies were centralized.
Bitcoin is a new kind of money: decentralized.
I'd like to encourage you to learn what Bitcoin actually is, and the basics of how it works.  While you're in research mode, learn about the significant problems in the global banking / fiat money system.
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:26:27
Yes.  Use a computer that will never be connected to the Internet.  Install the key generator code from, say, bitaddress dot org onto it, using a thumbdrive.  Generate random numbers with a die or flipping a coin, or pulling colors balls from a bag - type those numbers in and get your secure Private Key and corresponding Public "address".  Send your BTC to that address.
Make a secure backup copy of your private key(s) for off-site storage.  I suggest encrypting it first with a very long password.  Don't forget your password.
Sounds like a lot of trouble?  It's nothing compared to building/installing a safe for precious metals.
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:36:06
Buy a little at first \- know there is a learning curve, but it's worth it.  It's fun, too.
Don't invest more than you can afford to lose or have "locked up" for a couple of years.  Don't borrow money to invest.
Don't invest heavily in things you don't yet understand.
Take security seriously.  Either learn about private keys or invest in a "hardware wallet".
Learn to ignore the FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt spread by trolls).  Similarly, beware of "irrational exuberance".  Stay calm, in other words.  Don't panic.
So far, buying and holding for the long term has been very, very rewarding.  Having said that, know that extrapolation is seldom an accurate predictor.
Learn what Bitcoin actually is, and the basics of how it works.  Then learn the reasons Bitcoin was invented \- this will help you see its tremendous long\-term potential.
It's a wild ride.  Enjoy.

Not sure.  These things typically take longer than I estimate.
According to J Rickard's, when it collapses it will be like an avalanche, where one little thing sets it off, then once started, there's no stopping it, and for those in its path there is no time to get out of its way.  He presents a good case for using a stochastic/chaos-based model, as opposed to the obviously-wrong model used by central bankers and most "economists".
I thought the dot-com would end sooner than it did.  I thought the housing bubble would collapse sooner than it did.  I knew something like 2008 had to happen, but it happened later than I expected.
So, if I'm thinking, "Hmm.. next year to two years?"   Then maybe you should figure, next two to five years?  Who knows?  Maybe 6 months?

I have yet to encounter anybody who actually understands Bitcoin who does not believe in it.
I have encountered innumerable fools who attack it without any understanding whatsoever of what it is, how it works, why it exists.  Oh, they think they know all about it, but they're just repeating rubbish they heard elsewhere without giving any critical thought, without investigating or researching or learning...
It is my experience that most (90 percent or more) "gold bugs" don't even understand gold, for example.  Real estate is similar: so many people THINK they know all about it, but they've had their little heads filled with myths and other assorted rubbish.
Sadly, we also have a lot of Bitcoin "investors" who know very little about it besides the price.   
Every day, every hour, more people are seeing the big picture, and they're seeing how Bitcoin is a solution to some very serious problems.

I'm referring to your false premise.
@_date: 2018-06-17 14:41:41
All money, by design, has little or no **intrinsic** value.  That's the whole idea behind "money" -- a general purpose IOU into which a reasonable person can put their **trust** with minimal **risk**.  
For example, gold's **intrinsic** value is on par with other, similar metals: copper, aluminum, etc.
Gold and Bitcoin are forms of "good money" because they both have all of the necessary properties to be a **trusted, general purpose IOU**.  Durable, portable, divisible, recognizable, fungible, rare, and difficult to counterfeit.
So, an ounce of gold is "worth" more than an ounce of aluminum because gold is rare.
A Bitcoin is a number on a ledger; it has no intrinsic value, but it has tremendous value.
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:36:53
People who believe they can predict the price of Bitcoin by merely looking at a simple chart are fools.
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:46:07
Money is not gold, rather, gold is one form of money.  There are various forms of money.
Gold happens to be a form of "good money" because it has all of these 7 properites:
1. Durable
2. Divisible
3. Portable
4. Fungible
5. Recognizable
6. Rare
7. Difficult to counterfeit
Bitcoin also has all 7 of those properties.  So, Bitcoin is a form of "good money".
Money, in whatever form, is ultimately just a "general purpose IOU".
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:17:44
One thing I've noticed: people who attack Bitcoin don't know much about it, if anything.
They tend to think that because they're ignorant, we must also be equally ignorant -- so they say the dumbest things.
Sometimes people hear those dumb things, and without knowing any better, believe them -- for a while.  Eventually, the truth comes shining through.  Our job is to know the truth and keep feeding the truth to all who want to know.

Let's see.  Four things.  I'll be brief.
1. What if it doesn't?  How can it not?
2. What makes me think...?  People will chose Bitcoin when the current fiat currencies die. When, not if.
3. Consider how much fraud and crime is and has been associated with the USD, for instance.  Also, I'd rather discuss the biggest crimes which are being committed by central bankers as we speak.
4. Why do I think things will get better?  Because we will have an honest form of money.  Because we won't have a small group with the sole ability to create all the fiat "play money" they want, and those people will no longer be able to create money from thin air to loan to governments to fight endless wars, for example.  There will be less human suffering as a result.

Be patient.
When fiat finally implodes, you'll see a sudden mass adoption of Bitcoin.  Be ready for it.  In the meantime be patient and encourage others to learn what Bitcoin actually is, and that it is a GOOD thing, despite what they've already heard on the street or from their TV set.

Now is a good time to learn about Bitcoin and related topics.
There is a lot to know besides recent prices.
Learn about money.  What characteristics make something a good form of money?   Which of those characteristics does Bitcoin have?  Which of them does gold have?  Fiat currency?
Learn about the global banking system, how fractional reserve banking is supposed to work, what central banks do.  Can you explain to a reasonable person why central banks are evil?
Learn what Bitcoin actually is, and isn't.  Learn the basics of how it works.
Learn about the on-going currency war, how China, Russia and others are ditching USD hegemony and why.  Learn about the causes of the 2007/8 financial disaster, how no bankers went to jail, how nothing got fixed.
When you've been busy doing that, one day you'll notice that the price of Bitcoin is going up, up, up again...

1. Understand the problem; know your enemy
2. Cut off their supply line ("Stop feeding them," as solvangv points out.)
3. Wait.  Win.
The root of the problem: we have a small group with the sole ability to create all the money they want \-\- from thin air, backed by nothing \-\- by merely typing numbers into bank computers.  Since 2007 they've created many trillions of dollars worth of their "play money" and have been using it to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies, at the expense of the rest of us.  Their "legal counterfeiting" is a form of theft.  This, by the way, is their ONLY source of power.  They'd like us to believe they are "elite," but in reality they are weak criminals who can't win unless they cheat the rest of us.
Solution: stop using their central bank fiat currencies (play money).  Instead, use gold, silver coin, Bitcoin, barter \-\- these are things they cannot create from thin air.  This cuts off their "supply" of power; they get left holding databases showing they own billions and trillions of units of worthless play money.

Belt\-tightening tricks:

When you get to the checkout, ask yourself as you put items onto the belt, "What happens if I don't buy this right now?"  If they answer is, "something bad happens," then get it, otherwise, put it back.
Cars cost money to drive.  Combine trips.  Avoid unnecessary travel.

Fiat currencies always die; they are backed by nothing and too easily abused by those in power.  So far, today's existing fiat currencies appear to be on the usual trajectory which leads to their sudden collapse.

Nice Post!
Basically, there was an old fashioned "bank run" on the US in the early 70's.  Like a criminal banker, the US didn't have enough reserves to cover the "notes" they'd been dishing out.  Nixon's actions were essentially saying: "Yes, we're broke, but f. u.  What are you going to do to us?"
Anyhow, the best way for us to fight back against the criminal central bankers is to (as much as possible) stop using their fiat "play" money \-\- use Bitcoin, gold, and silver coin instead.  Like you said, the crooks can't create these from thin air.
Keep up the good work.

Currently, if you're a bank (in a country with a fractional reserve banking system) and you make a loan, about 90&amp; of that loan money is created from thin air, on the spot.  Gee.  Little risk there.  Meanwhile, you get to charge high interest on that "play money".
Meanwhile, if you're **not** a bank, and you loan somebody cash, or Bitcoin, or anything else of significant value, you'd better get some **collateral,** in case they don't pay you back.  This is how pawn shops operate, for example.
So, if somebody says, "Can I borrow a BTC?" I'd say, "What do you have as collateral?"  That collateral better be worth more than one BTC and not have a lien against it (say, a car with an outstanding loan for example).

We have a small group -- central bankers -- with the sole ability to create all the fiat currency they want from thin air by merely typing numbers into their computers. Since about 2007 they have created many trillions of USD worth of their "play money", and have been using those trillions to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies at the expense of the rest of us.
This is legalized counterfeiting; legalized theft.
These people are evil sociopaths.  They create and promote war, poverty, environmental destruction.

With the current global central bank fiat money system, we have, at its core an IOU system - money is based upon debt; money is general purpose IOUs.
Within that system we have a very small number of individuals with the sole power to legally create all the "IOUs" (fiat money notes) they want.  They don't have to print them, they don't back them with anything at all -- they merely type numbers into computers and edit account balances, and, poof, new "money" is created.  This money says that we OWE THEM, for debts.  But we don't owe them anything.  They are legally counterfeiting, and counterfeiting is theft.
A lot of people have been led to believe that this system can go on indefinitely like this.  But it cannot, and it will not.  It will eventually collapse.
Really, how long can you have a few crooks at the top creating tens of trillions of USD worth of fake money, claiming that the rest of us "owe" it to them, for nothing, so they can enrich and empower themselves and their cronies?
**Bitcoin is not like that kind of money.  Those bankers cannot create even one Bitcoin unless they mine it, just like everybody else.**

I know how you feel, I once paid about $850 and then it went to $200... but I held on.
Maybe it will help to remember the seriously significant problems with fiat money, central banking criminals, corrupt government officials...  In other words, remember why Bitcoin was invented in the first place.
Right now there is a small group with the sole ability to "legally counterfeit" all the fiat "play" money they want. Since about 2007, the central bankers have created many tens of trillions of dollars worth of their "play" money from thin air by merely typing numbers into the bank computers, and have been using it to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies \-\- at the expense of the rest of us. They've been buying all manner of actual wealth: real estate, stocks, bonds, commodities, yachts, furs, gems, politicians (both parties), judges, regulators, mass media news outlets... They are thieves. Criminals. Scum. Weak.
If we all switched to gold or silver, they'd have the government confiscate it from us.
Now we have Bitcoin. They cannot confiscate Bitcoin (unless you're dumb enough to hand over your private keys). They cannot create Bitcoin from thin air, like they've been doing with their "play money".
Our best way to fight them is to \-\- as much as possible \-\- stop using their "play" money (fiat currencies).
Anyhow, fiat money is doomed.  Bitcoin is even better than physical gold.

The next crisis will be the mother of all financial meltdowns.
Because the debt (relative to GDB) is bigger than ever, and the economy is still on "life support" from 2008, and nothing significant got fixed as a result of 2008 -- instead, the central banks blew even bigger financial bubbles, which will pop.
So, the next meltdown is highly likely to be the end of "money" as most people have come to know it (fiat currencies).
Some may go back to gold and/or silver.  Most will move onto using crypto, such as Bitcoin.

Other ways to "get rich" involving Bitcoin?  So far, buying and holding has been extremely rewarding for patient investors over the long run.  Frequent trading, for example, exposes you to risks and fees such that you'll soon regret having gone down that path.  So far, long term, the price of Bitcoin has more than doubled every year, on average.  If that's not high enough return for you, you're either an idiot, mentally ill, or both.
For someone with not a lot of money, like I said, buy and hold Bitcoin in a secure wallet can be extremely rewarding -- if you're patient.

Get out of debt, if you have any.  Stay out of debt.  Save an emergency cash cushion.  Then start investing.
Don't put all your eggs into one, or even just two baskets.  Eventually, own some of each, perhaps?
IF you buy gold, only buy **physical gold** which you store in a secure place.  Also, be sure to **test the gold you buy**.  There is gold-coated tungsten out there, which has nearly the same density as gold, so you'll need to invest in an ultrasonic tester (because sound travels at different speeds in gold as compared to tungsten).
If you buy Bitcoin, make sure you (and only you) control the **private key(s)**.  Learn to make backup copies of your private key(s) and store the backup copy (encrypted) in a secure off-site location.
Buying and holding Bitcoin has been extremely rewarding so far.  I see no reason for that to end.

Sometimes there are win-win, or even win-win-win situations.  It doesn't always have to be win-lose.
Clearly the government in Puerto Rico is broken.  Much infrastructure and other wealth has been wiped out.  Corruption abounds, from what I've gathered.
With Bitcoin, for example, people like me can "instantly" send "money" to friends or relatives on the island - without going through (corrupt) middlemen who take a serious cut.
So that's one way it can help.
Another possibility would be to take advantage of the open, public nature of the blockchain to track where and when donations to relief organizations are spent -- to cut down on corruption or at least expose corruption so donors can more efficiently direct their donation funds where they will better help victims as opposed to enriching crooks.
So, that's another way it can help.
Then there's the idea that by using "sound money" (Bitcoin, in this case) the economy can better grow and flourish compared to the corrupt ways of the past.

For many fiat currencies, 90 to 97 percent of it only exists in digital form.
So, we're already about as "cashless" as can be in most of the world.
The problem is that central bankers create tens of trillions of USD worth of their fiat currency "play money" from thin air - backed by nothing by stupidity/tradition/ignorance.  When they do that, they enrich and empower themselves and their cronies at the expense of the rest of us.  They commit theft, in addition to many other crimes.
Criminal bankers get to rob the rest of us.  Bitcoin puts an end to that.  Now, you can choose to get robbed, or you can choose to use Bitcoin.

A person can buy BTC, then store it in a wallet where they control the private keys. Nobody can confiscate it from them.
Or, they can pay a fund (ETF) to buy BTC, then hope that the fund is not run by another Bernie Madoff, then hope that the fund doesn't suddenly go bankrupt like Lehman Brothers did, then hope that the the fund doesn't get hacked, or claim to have been hacked... then hope that the government doesn't decide to confiscate part or all of money invested in the fund because the ETF will just fork it over when told to do so. Don't forget: the ETF exists to make money and charges fees to pay the owners, managers, employees, etc.

The minimum wage in Venezuela is about $1.50...
... per **month.**
@_date: 2018-07-12 01:42:53


Then they should be able to afford to buy some amount of BTC every week or every month.


But they won't own any Bitcoin.  They'll own "pretend" Bitcoins that only exist in the database of their ETF as an accounting entry.


See?  They're not really in charge of that money.  They can't use it when they want, how they want without having to cough up fines and fees.   And if/when "austerity" gets imposed, the government can merely take it from them.

IMO: In the **long-run** Bitcoin ETFs will suppress the price of Bitcoin.
Because there will then be "paper Bitcoins" and "actual Bitcoins" analogous to the "paper gold vs physical gold" we see lately (which I feel plays a big part in the relatively poor performance of gold's price over the last decade or so).  Yes, **there are hundreds of ounces of paper gold for every ounce of physical gold.**  A lot of people ***think*** they're invested in gold, but they're not.  If/when the shit hits the fan, they'll have to find out the hard way, when gold goes up past $40K, $50K, $100K per ounce -- that they don't have any, they've been robbed by the banksters.
Meanwhile, why pay an ETF to supposedly buy and hold BTC for you when you can just buy and store it yourself?

History repeats itself.
Krugman is a famous idiot.  Why do I call him an idiot?  Because he says we can make everybody rich by just creating more fiat money from thin air.  History says otherwise.  Current events in Venezuela say otherwise.  Is everybody in Venezuela sinking rich?  No.  In fact, there is great misery!  Still, according to the shit Krugman has been preaching, they should all be stinking rich, based upon their inflation rate.

Definitely get your own wallet.  I've been told that your home computer is likely to be safer than a cell phone wallet.  "Hardware wallets" are highly recommended and probably the most secure and easiest to use.
Where to purchase?  Which has lower fees?  Probably Coinbase.  If you use an exchange, don't let too many BTC accumulate there -- transfer it to your wallet, it's much safer there.
Bitcoin is "sound money" like gold and silver coins.  My aunt was a waitress and saved her tips, which were pre-1965 coins.  They stopped using solid silver coins, the price of silver went up, and she had a comfortable retirement.  I hope you do, too.

So far, buying and holding Bitcoin has been an extremely rewarding long-term investment.  I see no reason for that to change.
Bitcoin Is Good For You!
* don't borrow to invest
* don't invest money you cannot afford to have "locked up" (underwater) for a year or two
* don't invest money you cannot afford to lose
* don't invest **heavily** in things you don't understand
So, I recommend, buy some Bitcoin with your "fun money".  Maybe, delay that new car purchase, or that extra vacation...  Get some, then start learning.  For example, learn about wallets, then get a wallet and transfer your BTC (Bitcoin) from the exchange where you bought it into your wallet where it will be much safer.
Keep coming here to ask questions or just read and learn.  It's a fascinating hobby, and, like I said, for those with patience, it has been extremely rewarding so far.

Today's horrible analogy:
The ship hit an iceberg, and it is going to sink.
Some people are busy boarding actual life boats.
Others are in the ship's casino, gambling  against each other with little plastic chips about the future price of lifeboats.  So what if they end up with a big pile of plastic chips?  When the ship tilts and slides into the icy water, they'll be sorry.
The people on the lifeboats will be saved.
Actual Bitcoin is the "lifeboats".  The ETF market is the "casino".  The plastic chips are USD.
Why?  Because they'll end up doing to Bitcoin what they did to gold: there are hundreds of ounces of "paper gold" for every ounce of physical.
When SHTF, that "paper gold" will be worthless, except maybe to wipe your butt with.  Same for "paper Bitcoin".

Listen people: "cryptocurrency" is backed by cryptography.  Anybody telling you that their "crypto" is backed by anything else is scamming you, just like Maduro in Venezuela claiming his bullshit coin is backed by oil.
If you want to own gold, buy gold, physical gold, test it to make sure it isn't gold-coated garbage, and find a safe, secure way to store it (like, NOT in a safe deposit box in a bank).  When somebody says, "Oh, trust me, I'll hold your gold for you," you're taking a bad risk.
Similarly, if you want to buy Bitcoin, buy Bitcoin, then put them in your own wallet, where only YOU control the private key (and keep a backup copy, preferably encrypted, in a safe, secure off-site location - NOT in a bank safe deposit box).  Don't "trust" some ETF hedge fund and/or their paid custodial service, don't trust an exchange.  There's no need for that.  Get your own wallet and store your BTC there.

You can memorize a private key, or a 24 word "seed" and take your BTC with you wherever you go.  No weight, no space, completely undetectable, cannot be taken from you by force.

An ETF is when an ignorant person gives their fiat money to a bankster, believing that the bankster will actually buy Bitcoin with that money, and hold it securely for him, and charge him fees, and hand the ignorant person's money over to the government when told to do so.
The ignorant person should just buy their own Bitcoin and keep it in an address for which they (and they alone) control the Private Key(s), where no bankster can steal, lie, cheat, rob, and where no government can confiscate.

*He was born in Kentucky, raised in Indiana, and lived in Illinois. And this is what he said. This is what Abe Lincoln said.*  
"The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present.  
The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion.  
As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew.  
We must disenthrall ourselves and then we will save our country." \[Annual Message to Congress, December 1, 1862\]  
*When standing erect he was six feet four inches tall, and this is what he said.*  
**He said: "It is the eternal struggle between two principles, right and wrong, throughout the world.**  
**It is the same spirit that says 'you toil and work and earn bread, and I'll eat it.'**
  
**No matter in what shape it comes, whether from the mouth of a king who seeks to bestride the people of his own nation, and live by the fruit of their labor, or from one race of men as an apology for enslaving another race, it is the same tyrannical principle."** \[Lincoln-Douglas debates, 15 October 1858\]  
*Lincoln was a quiet man. Abe Lincoln was a quiet and a melancholy man. But when he spoke of democracy, this is what he said.*  
He said: "As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master.  
This expresses my idea of democracy.  Whatever differs from this, to the extent of the difference, is no democracy."

My recommendation:
Use the program found at [
Run that program on a computer which is disconnected from the Internet and which will **never** be connected to the Internet again.  Supposedly, that program does a good job of generating randomness.  To be extra sure, you might want to get a quality die, roll it 99 times and enter the numbers rolled.  Go to the "wallet details" page/tab.  Near the bottom you'll see, "How do I make a wallet using dice? What is B6?"  Follow the directions.
You can generate as many keys as you'd like.  Write them down.  Some people suggest making three copies, with two-thirds of each key on each piece such that any two of the three copies are sufficient to reconstitute the key(s).
You'll want backup copies of your keys, in case of fire, flood, or other disaster - you'll still have a second copy (or the other two of three copies).
Do not store any of this in any bank's safe deposit box.
Do store your copies securely.
If you use several keys, you will only have to put part of your BTC at risk at any time - in the event you want to send/spend some.

You'd have to see the entire balance sheet of the ETF, in real time, AND see the address(es)... 
Event then, there's a possibility of getting ripped off:
Let's say Bernie Madoff Jr. is running an ETF.  He has a wallet with a public address, which he publishes, but HE has control of the private key for that wallet.  He takes in $10 million from ETF customers, and publishes that.  You look and see that ten million USD worth of BTC has been sent to his published wallet.  THEN Bernie JR just disappears.
You're a sucker in that case.
But suppose the fund is run by Johnny O'Nest.  He takes in $10 million, buys $10 million worth of BTC and puts it into the wallet which no one person controls.  Then the US Government says, "Fork it over."  Johnny doesn't want to sit in jail, so he forks it over, and IT'S GONE.  What are you going to do?  You're a sucker.
Or, honest Jonny's wallet gets HACKED.  Oh, gee... you lose, Mr./Mrs ETF sucker.

Fools and their money/wealth are soon parted.
Bitcoin was designed and carefully built so that **we no longer need to trust third parties**.
What is an ETF?  Some "trusted" dude says, "Yeah, give me your money.  I promise I'll buy Bitcoins with it, and hold them for you."  He looks you in the eye and lies to your face because, unlike you, he's a sociopath.
Why trust that guy when you can just buy and store BTC all by yourself?  When you control the private keys, nobody can confiscate it from you or charge you fees to own it.  Nobody can pull a Bernie Madoff on you.  Nobody can just take the Bitcoins and claim, "Oh, gee, the ETF got hacked... I \*swear\*!"

I have good reasons to doubt your ability to do either of those things.

They might buy Bitcoin.  They might not.  How would you know?
Bernie Madoff's victims believed he was investing their money for them, for example.
Meanwhile, I'm not so excited about ETFs because I'm not desperate.  I'm patient.  I can wait.
Also, I know there are hundreds of ounces of "paper gold" for every ounce of physical gold.  We could end up with hundreds or thousands of "paper BTC" for every real BTC.
yeah, yeah -- regulators, auditors, blah blah blah.  I DON'T TRUST THEM, AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU.  They've shown themselves to be useless failures.
@_date: 2018-07-13 19:39:17
Gold used to be the main currency.  Gold is expensive/difficult to store and/or transport securely.  It was then, too.  So people started storing their gold in the goldsmith's vault.  Why not?  He had to have secure storage anyhow.    Drop off some gold, get a note to represent that gold.  Banks were born.  Banknotes were born.  Eventually, the goldsmith-bankers figured out they could lend out part of the gold in their vault, figuring that most people would leave most of their gold in storage most of the time.  Fractional reserve lending was born.  Occasionally, people would figure out that there was a lot more banknote gold in circulation than real gold - bank runs were born.  Credit-driven boom and bust cycles were born.
Fast forward a 110 years.  Central banks and deposit insurance are supposed to prevent bank runs and credit cycles.  Never mind 1929.  Never mind 2008/9.  This post is about ETFs.  They're up to their old "trick" but with a new name.  "Yeah, I'll hold your gold, right here in my secure vault, and here's a piece of paper to prove it's yours..."  We've ended up with hundreds of ounces of "paper gold" for every ounce of real gold.  The next bank run should be very interesting, if not epic.
What next?  "Paper Bitcoin," to go with "paper gold".   What?  Yes.  We all know that there will ever be at most 21 million BTC, and likely 16 or 17 million will be the max because of lost coins, etc.  So, what happens when the supply of "paper Bitcoin" is several hundred, or even thousands of times higher that 21 million??
Don't tell me about "regulators" and "auditors" -- it will just prove to me your ignorance about this subject.  Instead, ask questions, like:
* Where are the regulators when there are hundreds of ounces of paper gold for every ounce of physical gold?
* Where were the regulators in 2006/7?  CDOs.  Subprime mortgages.  Outright fraud...
* What about the repeated failures of the "big four" accounting firms -- they say a company is in good shape and next thing you know, it's bankrupt? 
If you want to put your faith in a system which has repeatedly shown itself to be corrupt to the core (including the so-called regulators, auditors, ratings agencies), then Bitcoin is not the thing for you.  In my opinion you're an ignorant fool.
Bitcoin was designed and built so that we would not longer have to trust those crooks.  So, why trust them with your Bitcoin?

So, put the main point in the title -- that will be the ONLY part of what you write that most people will read.  Make it concise, clear, unambiguous.  Test it on a couple of people who fall into your "target audience" category.
The first paragraph should back up your main point, and if you're a good writer, will also give the reader a reason to keep reading.
The rest of the article should be factual, contain examples, and should support your main point.  Ideally, the entire piece -- the presentment of the information should go from general-to-specific.  That's how people learn: not by diving into details, but by going from general to specific.
Keep it short.
People have short attention spans.

**Executive Summary: Stop using fiat currencies and start using Bitcoin, silver coin, and gold.**
The best way to fight against that evil is to attack the root of the problem, rather than the symptoms.  I've given this a lot of thought.
**Root of problem**: we have a small group with the sole ability to create all the fiat money they want: central bankers (the Federal Reserve in the US).  Since their system "crashed" in 2007/8, they've created tens of trillions of USD worth of their "play money" and have been using it to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies -- at the expense of the rest of us.  Actually, they've always been doing that, but not at the preposterous scale we've seen lately.
Their system is based upon ever-growing, never-ending **debt and their ability to "print" all the money they want**.
**War is extremely expensive and drives up huge amounts of debt.**  So, the central bankers like wars, and military conflicts, and any expensive government waste.  Compare the US military budget to the rest of the world.  The US spends almost as much as every other country combined.  Why?  To keep us safe?  Hell, no.  To drive government debt so the central bankers and their pals can become even richer and more powerful.
**THE SOLUTION IS SIMPLE:** as much as possible, stop using central banker "play money" (aka "fiat currencies").  That is their only source of power, their "supply line".  In a real war, one way to win quickly is to cut off your opponent's supply line.  Instead of using USD, Euros, Pounds, Yen, Yuan, etc., start using gold, silver coin, and **Bitcoin.**  Why?  Because the criminal bankers cannot create these forms of money "from thin air."

Bitcoin has no holding costs.  Bitcoin can be "transported" to where taxes are lower.

The FORMER Soviet Union HAD one of the most power militaries, ever.  But their currency collapsed due to what many call "money printing" (which is what the Federal Reserve and other banks have been engaged in, lately).
Did their powerful military protect their currency?
Now you know the truth, actually two truths:
1. Militaries do not support the value of any currencies.
2. You have been lied to, repeatedly, until you became brainwashed.
But you can learn the truth!  I, for example, was once brainwashed by the same lies, and I broke free.  If I can do it, you can do it even better!

The Federal Reserve (and central banks in general) is a colossal failure, when measured by the bullshit reasons we've been given for their existence.
Of course, if you believe that they exist as a banking cartel to thwart honest competition, they're a huge success.  If you believe that they exist in order to greatly enrich and empower themselves and their cronies at the expense of the rest of us, again, they're hugely successful.
Their own web site says: 






The Federal Reserve Act mandates that the Federal Reserve conduct monetary policy "so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
They fail.  They fail at employment, they fail at price stability, and in my lifetime I've seen interest rates from 20&amp; to zero percent.
Their "real" job is to "print money from nothing," to bail out, enrich, and empower themselves and their buddies.  They are evil.

You're wasting your time and effort.
I'm sorry.  I know you worked hard, but the fact is: you can't guess the future accurately enough to be able to get away with frequent trading.
Look: Over the long term, on average, the price of Bitcoin has more than doubled every year.
Let that sink in.
More than doubled every year, on average.
If that's not a good enough "ROI" for you, then you're fucked up and there is no cure.
Every trade involves risk and a fee.  Eventually, those risks and fees take frequent traders to the poor house.

No.  Housing bubbles are easy to see, plain as day, unless you've been deluded by realtors, lenders, well meaning friends and relatives, and their myths.
It makes a difference because you don't want to end up owing a lot more than the home is worth.  You might think you won't care, but you will.  Plus, you might have to, or want to move, but you'll be stuck.  Why do that to yourself if you can avoid it?

Long before one Satoshi is worth one USD, we will have reached a state of "permanent backwardization."
That is, people will have stopped using USD as "money" because the USD will be recognized by all as worthless at that point.

How big is 2 to the 256th power?
One way I've seen it explained: Imagine how many grains of sand there are on planet Earth - every beach, every ocean, river, lake, ... every desert, sand storm clouds, etc.
Now, imagine that each of those specs of sand is its own "earth-like" planet, with just as many grains of sand on it as the Earth has.
Out of all the sand on all of those sand-worlds, you're looking for a particular grain of sand.  Better pick just the right grain here on Earth, then make yourself really small, go down onto the grain you picked, then pick one grain from all of its sand.  Didn't find the one you're looking for?  Try again.
You'll need more than luck.

There is and has been a "revolving door" between government regulation agencies and the entities (banks, etc.) they're supposedly monitoring.
Think carefully before placing trust in those people in that kind of situation.
Study the causes of the 2008/9 financial meltdown -- where was the regulation and/or government protection when we needed it, that is, *before* the catastrophe?
While you're at it, try to find out what got fixed since then.  If your answer ends up being something like, "nothing significant got fixed," then perhaps you'll see more and more of the real long-term beauty of Bitcoin.

Or, I can pay some ETF dude his fees, then have to trust that he's not another Bernie Madoff, then trust that he and/or his corporation doesn't go broke or run off with the funds or pretend to get hacked or actually get hacked... while I also trust the so-called regulators and auditors (who have already demonstrated they should not be trusted).

I saw a post here about running a lightening node on a Raspberry Pi (or, it might have been an "Orange" Pi).
I've been thinking about doing it.    
Your post just convince me to do it.
I have a spare R-Pi sitting right here.  I have to go to the store later, so I'll pick up an external drive for it.  Stay tuned.
The Pi itself is only $35, but you'll need a power supply, Internet cable, external USB drive, an SD card, and optionally a plastic case.

Seriously, I've never had the need, nor desire for a smart phone.  Sometimes I feel bad watching other people walk around with their faces glued to those tiny screens... I feel bad for my friends who have to check their phones every 3 or 4 minutes while we're supposed to be having lunch together.
You know, people used to sit around, listen to albums and TALK to each other.   Today, people's attention spans are about 8 seconds.  (Yes, I've actually counted.)  Back in the days... a "long story" took about an hour, and a 12-pack of beer.  Now, a "long story" is 32 seconds.  I'm not making this up.
So, I haven't needed a smart phone, nor wanted one -- until now.

Or, I can pay somebody to buy them for me, then hope that he's not a Bernie Madoff, then hope that his company doesn't suddenly go bankrupt like Lehman Brothers did, then hope that the he doesn't get hacked, or claim to have been hacked... then I get to hope that the government doesn't decide to confiscate my investment because the ETF will just fork them over.

You did not convince me that you have an understanding of how Bitcoin actually works. Also, you do not have to read even one line of code to know the basics of how Bitcoin works.

Most fiat is digital.  Over 90&amp; of USD, for example, is digital and exchanged digitally.

Smart people care.
Obviously, you don't care.
@_date: 2018-07-05 00:56:12
They do.
Why do you think counterfeiting is illegal for the rest of us?
Suppose you had a bank account where you could change the balance to whatever you wanted, then click "Save" and poof, all the money you want.  Suppose you gave yourself a few trillion dollars. 
Four trillion dollars is enough to make four million people into instant millionaires.
So, there's your new account balance: $4,000,000,000,000
You rush out and buy things: stocks, real estate, businesses, gems, gold, yachts, private jumbo jets, exotic cars, etc.  
You buy congress people, senators, judges, and regulators by the score.
If you're smart, you'll also buy some mass media and have them brainwash the public that you're a good person who just happens to be smarter and harder working than the rest - but that's bullshit and you know it.
Meanwhile, where did all that stuff come from?  
WHERE DID YOUR NEW WEALTH COME FROM?
You didn't make it; you did nothing to earn it.  You took no risks.  Nobody chose to give it to you.  You merely took it from society - you stole it by merely typing a big number into a computer and clicking the "save" button.
This is, in a nutshell, how central banks rob the rest of us to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies.

Every trade involves risk and a fee.  Eventually the risks and fees win.
You can't predict the future price of Bitcoin accurately enough to beat the market consistently.

Some say gold is WAY underpriced.  I tend to agree.
Possible cause for its low price includes, but is not limited to ETF "paper gold" (hundreds of ounces of "paper gold" for every ounce of physical gold).
Other causes to consider: Gold coated tungsten.  Fear of government confiscation.  Ignorance among the general public.
A Bitcoin  ETF could result in hundreds or even thousands of "paper Bitcoins" for every real Bitcoin.  Tell me how that would be good for it's price in the long run.

1. Most people are broke... debt slaves... they have ZERO cash for Bitcoin, and they can't put it on their credit card or HELOC.
2. Most people are LAZY and would rather drink bleach than do math or logic.  Bitcoin is closely related to those.  Which is easier to understand (never mind which is right or wrong): It's a decentralized, public, distributed, immutable ledger protected by cryptographic proof of work, or "it's a scam".  You could replace "scam" with any other one-syllable word and they'd believe it.  "It's a shoe," for example.
3. Most people have no idea of the actual dire state of the global banking system.  They're in for it when the next financial crisis hits.
When the SHTF, they'll come flocking, and the price will go well into outer space, so load up on BTC now, at today's low prices.

See?  You don't know what you're talking about.
You're attacking something (a relatively new technology) which you have no understanding of.
Bitcoin transactions are "instantaneous" compared to traditional banking transactions, which often take days or even weeks to "clear" (settle).
Bitcoin **transactions** are not subject to hacks or forks.  You're just plain wrong, buddy-boy.
They're not reversible by **design.**  See?  You don't understand this topic.
Various governments have already banned crypto, or tried to -- and failed.  Again, you are just full of sh\*\*.

Bitcoin Is Good For You!
So far, Bitcoin has been a totally rewarding (and fun) long-term buy-and-hold investment.  Since it keeps improving, I see no end to that trend.
Bitcoin is good.  The current global banking system is corrupt and evil.
Bitcoin is strong, safe, and secure.  Fiat money is doomed.

When I was a little kid, I sure was impressed with those massive, solid-looking bank vaults.  Gosh-darn, they must have bags full of gold back there, and boxes full of crisp million dollar bills.
I got older, and learned that there aren't any million dollar bills (yet, but examine Zimbabwe...)  I also wondered, one day, why they keep the vault door ajar like that.  Apparently, it's all a big prop, a big "show".  Turns out the sides, back, roof, and floor of the vault aren't so massive, and only have to be thick enough to make it likely to take more than two or three days to cut through...
I got older and found out, there aint shit in that vault... not much for how big and massive and intimidating the always-ajar vault doors are.   When we deposit our money into the bank, it's typically electronic "checking money".  The bank loans most of it out, and keeps a small percentage - in their computer... not in the big vault, which is there just to impress people that their money is "safe" here (when it really isn't).
I got older and Bitcoins were invented.  Oh, thank God for Bitcoin.

The criminal bankers silently overthrew our government during the prior financial crisis.  Those banksters now "own and operate" the politicians -- our government.
The best way to "fight back" is to simply stop using their fake money (as much as possible).  Bitcoin is one way to ditch their evil money system in favor of something fair, honest, open, secure... something which they cannot merely create out of thin air to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies.  Gold and silver coins are another way to ditch them and their corrupted financial bullshit.

Well, it all starts with electricity.  Actually, before that, it starts with protons, electrons, and neutrons.  Actually, before that, there was a big bang when/when "stuff" got created: matter, energy, space, time, forces, gravity, electricity, light, magnets, and the immutable laws of nature which govern the the behaviors and interactions between all those things.  Yes, and then there was life, too.  Otherwise, there would be no people to build robots and thus no robots or people to ask questions about robots.
So, you have all this stuff, which exists within time and space... stuff which interacts with other stuff through visible and invisible forces.  And you have people.  And people use stuff to build new stuff.  And then they discover electricity.  So, it kind of starts with electricity, but before you can have electricity you need all that "stuff," and so it **really** starts with the creation of the stuff.
With electricity, the electrons break free and travel around.  They particularly find it relatively easy to travel, that is, flow around the outside of metal surfaces.  Metal, as you probably know, is a form of "stuff".  It's pretty neat.  And it is used for making certain robot parts, like the electrical wires, the frame/skeleton, the motors, coiled springs, and the claws.  I mean, every good robot should have a set of gnarly claws.  Right? 
So the electrons flow over the metal, and some of them go into the CPU "brain" circuits, and some go to the sensors, and some go into the motors and makes them turn this way, or that, depending upon how the CPU "brain" controls them.  Eventually, the electricity gets tired of being in the robot and it flows back out the cord and into the AC plug at the wall, but that's okay because new electricity arrives at the same time, but then, the nuclear power plant changes it's mind and reverses the direction of the electric current (it does this 60 times each second).  So, some of the electrons that just went back into the wall come back out and go into the robot's power supply - again.  But that's the power supply's problem.  Some of the electricity eventually makes it to the toaster.
Meanwhile, the robot goes into a "loop", that is, it repeats the same steps over, and over, and over, and over and over until somebody accidentally kicks the cord and unplugs it.  It reads input from the sensors, then it evaluates the situation and decides what, if anything, to do next, then it moves one or more of the motors, and maybe it makes a little green light blink so the humans know everything is okay.  Then it reads input, evaluates, moves.  Eventually, the robot decides it's bored and starts moving the claw.
You'd better step back - that claw is wicked and sharp, and might be electrified.  Heck, it might even shoot a big **lightning bolt** across room, hitting you in the chest, stopping your heart, and killing you.  You see, robots don't care.
So, that's how robots work.  Except for writing the software for the brain...

Okay. I watched it.
He/you claims that stocks are traded based on value. (1:30)  That USED to be the case but hasn't been the case for about a decade.  (2:10) He thinks today's stock market is okay.  It isn't.  It is in a bubble, fueled by free/low-cost money created by the Federal Reserve (and other central banks) from thin air.
At (2:50) he gets hung up on "return on money".  Like I said earlier: Bitcoin IS money.
Let me encourage you to think about it like this.  Suppose you were living in Zimbabwe many years ago, and you could tell that the Zimbabwe dollars was about to be hyperinflated into oblivion.  You see people people buying, say, USD with their Zimbabwe dollars.  You see the price of USD going up sharply in relation to the local currency.  If you're thinking, "I'll buy some USD, hold it for a little while, then sell if for Zimbabwe currency and be rich," you're a short sighted fool.  On the other hand, if you realize, "I need to park my wealth in something that will have value later, something like the USD, which I can get my hands on," then you see my point.
In our case, today, central bank fiat money is doomed just like the Zimbabwe dollar.  Think about "zero percent interest rates" (ZIRP), "NEGATIVE" interest rates, quantitative easing... look at the central bank balance sheets...  
When the SHTF, there will be more money confiscations, like last time, only worse.  Bail outs, bail ins, more "money printing" by the central banks... bank holidays... etc.  Read, "Hormegeddon," for example.  My government (and yours too) can lock me out of my banking funds and retirement funds denominated in fiat money with a few clicks on a keyboard.  **They cannot confiscate my BTC.**  They can, and will devalue my savings, but my BTC will be there to protect me from them.

No need to trade Bitcoin.
Just buy and hold long term.  So far, the long term average has more than doubled  the price of Bitcoin each year.  All you have to do is be patient.  It that isn't a high enough ROI for you, you're fucked up, sick in the head, and there is no cure for you.
Frequent trading involves risk, and fees, and you're more likely to lose in the long run.  So just buy and hold for the long term!

I tried to come up with a lottery model that could also prevent double spending...  I didn't get very far.  Basically, have a lottery every ten minutes.  Instead of mining and using tons of electricity, you buy a lottery ticket, for like, one satoshi each.  Something like that.  I need to go for a long walk and just think about it more...

That's foolish.  There's really no need for trading at all. Each trade has risk and a fee. Eventually, the fees and risk win, and the frequent trader loses, like any other gambler who believes they know how to "beat the house".
Long term, on average the price of BTC more than doubles every year. If that isn't enough ROI for you, you're fucked up, crazy, mentally ill - and there's no cure.

A short, but excellent book (if you can find a copy): Katz, "The Paper Aristocracy".
A much longer version of roughly the same thing: Griffin, "The Creature from Jekyll Island."  The first 2/3rds of that book are very good to read.
A more recent account of the kind of things likely to transpire, and why, might be: Bonner, "Hormegeddon".  It has good tips for what to expect, and how yoiu might prepare.
A more academic approach, might be a set of books by Jim Rickards: "Currency Wars," "The Death of Money," "Road to Ruin,".  I see he has a new book (he's been promising a set of four), "Aftermath".
Seeing things from a slightly different angle, Matt Taibbi's "Griftopia" exposes how corrupt and fucked up "the system" is.
The current system is not sustainable.
When it collapses, it will be quite sudden, dramatic, and too late to prepare.  As Rickards says, it will be like an avalanche (if you're familiar with stochastic processes, you'll appreciate the third of his four books I mentioned).
You see, the people in charge are clueless and corrupt.

So far, on average, the price of Bitcoin more than doubles each year.
If that's not a high enough return, you're fucked up and there is no cure.
There is no need of constant trading.  Every trade carries risk (and a fee).  Eventually the risks and fees render the frequent trader broke.
Meanwhile, the people who buy and hold end up nicely rewarded for their patience.
@_date: 2018-07-09 01:26:30
So far, buy-and-hold has been an extremely rewarding long-term strategy, and from everything I can see/read, it should remain that way.

Nobody thinks much of the lifeboats until the ship sinks.
The global economy struck an iceberg in 2008.  This ship is doomed.
Based upon the many dozens of books I've read, the thousands of web pages I've read, the countless hours of listening to videos... based upon math, history, and common sense I can say:
**Fiat money is doomed.**
The next financial crisis will be the mother of all meltdowns because the debt-to-gdp ratio is sickening.  We're pretty darn likely to witness the death of "money as we have come to know it".  Venezuela.  Zimbabwe.  Argentina.  The ***former*** Soviet Union.  1920's Germany (Weimar Republic).  There is no shortage of fiat money failures.
What's different this time is that we have this amazing GIFT we call Bitcoin: a new kind of money which cannot be hyperinflated by any government or bank, cannot be confiscated (if and only if you control the private keys), can be sent anywhere in the world, any time, day or night...
As people start to realize that **nothing got fixed as a result of 2008/9** and that the global banking system is "sinking", they'll flee to Bitcoin in droves.
**Banksters cannot create Bitcoin from thin air.**  This point is essential to understand.  We now can choose to park our wealth where their evil system can silently steal it from us.

Taxes? When a government tells the ETF guys to fork over a big chunk of your Bitcoin ETF balance for taxes, the ETF guys are going to do just that, and there's no way to stop them.
Taxes?  The USD is on the road to ruinous collapse, and you're worried about trying to get a tax advantage?
You don't seem to understand the severe gravity of our current situation.  You seem to think that this is how everything is going to be from now on, that Federal Reserve and other central banks can merely keep creating unfathomable amounts of money from thin air, backed by nothing, and that there will be no price to pay down the road, as long as you can sit around and believe you're getting a tax break.
When a person has a wallet, and controls the private keys for their Bitcoins, nobody can unilaterally take them by force.  That might not seem like a big deal to you now, but think about the people of Cyprus when the bankers took money from their accounts; think about the people of Greece when their banks were shut down; think about the people of France who saved for retirement so that the government can say, "austerity measures" are necessary, we'll just help ourselves to your retirement money.  I know people who fled from Vietnam in the 1970's --- they wish they had Bitcoins back then.  I know a guy who had all of his accounts frozen by the IRS - click - just like that, because he couldn't reach a fair agreement with them.
If you don't control the private keys, you don't own Bitcoin, and your "wealth" can (and likely will) be confiscated from you during the next financial meltdown.  The ultra rich can't go after poor people, and they're not going after themselves -- that leaves people like us.  Me?  I'm going to protect my wealth from them.

So, I can pay the ETF guy his fees, then trust that he's actually buying Bitcoin with the money I gave him, and trust that he isn't another Bernie Madoff... AND trust that he gets regulated and audited, and trust the regulators and auditors even though they've demonstrated they cannot be trusted....    And then I have to HOPE AND PRAY that the  government never decides to merely confiscate my ETF balance...
I can just buy some BTC, then put it into a wallet for which I control the private keys, knowing that nobody can take my Bitcoin by force.

Oops.  There are fewer than 70 million BTC, there will never be that many -- not even close -- maybe 16 million Bitcoins.

Today: 1 BTC = $6240

I always recommend:
1. Buy a relatively small amount of BTC, using a popular exchange (or from somebody you already know and trust)
2. Get a good wallet for your home computer.  Don't store BTC on any smart phone.  Transfer some of your BTC from the exchange to your wallet.  Verify that you can do it.  Take notes for when you do it again later; keep the notes in a safe place.
3. Send some BTC from your wallet back to the exchange.  Yay!  Now you're getting it.
4. Send all of your BTC from the exchange to your home wallet.
5. Learn how to make a secure backup of your private keys / wallet file.  Or, make a paper printout of your private key(s) and put it in a secure, fire-resistant, flood-proof location.
If you can do all that with $20 worth of BTC, you could do the same thing with $2 million worth of BTC.
Before you rush out to buy $2 million worth of BTC, I recommend learning about "cold storage", off-line wallets, hardware wallets, etc.  I would also recommend buying the BTC in "chunks" so that IF something bad happens, you only lose part of your money, instead of all of it.

Bitcoin is a ledger - a list of transactions.  A transaction is where one "account" sends an amount of BTC to another "account".
Each account has two "keys": one is private, and the other is public.  The private key (which must be kept secret) allows a person to send BTC *from* their account to another account -- the private key is used for proving that you actually own that account. \[Digital signatures...\]
The public keys are the ones stored in the "ledger".  
**The public key (address) is where BTC can be sent TO**.
When somebody wants to send BTC to you, you give them the **public** key (address) for an account for which you own the *private* key.  They don't need to know your private key to send BTC to you, they only need your public key.  They **will** need their own private key in order to digitally sign the transaction (to prove they own the BTC being sent).
Your wallet helps you manage your keys.
If you have BTC on Coinbase, then you're wise to move it to an account for which you control the private key.  Your wallet should be able to give you a **public key/address** for receiving BTC.  You'll need to **carefully** enter that public key into the Coinbase web page.
Try not to fuck up:
1. Keep your private key(s) private/secret
2. Any time you enter a public key (aka "address") make double/triple sure it is accurate (there is no "undo")
3. Keep a secure **backup** of your private key(s) (or your wallet file, or pass phrase if your wallet provides one)
4. Keep the back up in a separate location (in case of fire, flood, tornado, meteor...)
5. Don't store your backup in a bank safe deposit box
6. Don't store large amounts of USD or BTC on any web site / echange
7. Beware of phishing scams
Enjoy being your  own banker!

As for me, I saw the impending doom of the central banks and their fiat currency "play money" before I heard of Bitcoin.
That is, fiat currencies last, on average, only about 50 years.  For example the US stopped pretending to be on a gold standard in 1971.  The clock has been ticking since...
For example, look at the Federal Reserve's balance sheet before and after about 2007.  They've succumbed to "money printing" which has always failed in the past, in the long run, and I see no reason for the US situation to be significantly different from all the other failures.
A similar case could be made for other central banks: European, England, Japanese, Chinese, etc.
I see Bitcoin as a reaction to the inevitable collapse of the current banking system, not the cause of it.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
— That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, **deriving their just powers from the consent of the governe**d, 
— That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, **it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government**, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. 
Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. 
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, **it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.**

It means that more computer power is being applied to "protect Bitcoin".  Bitcoin is more secure, safer from attack.
The main way to attack Bitcoin, as mentioned in the original white paper, is to launch a "51 percent attack" - and perform "double spending".
Double spending: Evil George sends 5 BTC to Alice as a payment.  Evil George only transmits his transaction to some of the miners.  To the rest of the miners, he sends those same 5 BTC to another wallet of his.  Basically, he "writes a bad check".  George can't get away with writing a bad Bitcoin check unless he controls over half of the mining power.
Nobody can rewrite history on the Bitcoin blockchain (ledger) unless they control more than half of the mining power.
**To control more than half of the mining power, you need more than half of the hash rate.**
The more honest miners there are, the more it would cost a dishonest "evil George" to obtain more than half of the hash rate.  At a certain point, it's more profitable for "evil George" to just mine Bitcoin than to scam Alice!

"Money" as most of us have come to know it is about to cease to exist.
Bitcoin is a new kind of money.  Bitcoin is good.  Bitcoin works.
If you have no wealth, why should you care?  Probably, the reason you have no wealth is that you're stuck in a crooked system which denies ordinary people a fair chance.
My parents' generation: men with little or no education did well by merely going to work 5 days a week and not being stupid.  People like that bought homes, raised families, had a station wagon and took the family on vacation once or twice a year -- on one "ordinary" income.  Moms mostly were able to stay at home and care for the kids, volunteer at the school/community, etc.
Today?  I see well educated people with "above average" jobs who have to have roommates to get by.  Most families have two or more jobs, piles of debt, and struggle to get by.  If you think today's economy is okay, you're high on dope.

Gold is a form of "good money" because it has all seven of these essential properties:
1. Durable
2. Divisible
3. Portable
4. Fungible
5. Recognizable
6. Rare
7. Difficult to counterfeit.
The "utility" value of gold is on par with, say, aluminum or maybe copper.  So, scarcity is extremely important when considering gold's value as a good money.
Fiat money is not backed at all.  Hence the name.  "These little green rags are valuable because I say so..."  Who are you?  "I'm your king!"  Well, I didn't vote for you... etc.

Nicely written!
You're right, most people have no clue about what money is, what makes one form of money better/worse than another.  Still, many people seem to think they're an expert simply because they've used "money" most of their life.
I like this description, a lot:  Money allows complete strangers to engage in commerce without much trust.
My personal description has been: Money is general purpose IOUs.  I like your description more.

You are wise to not trust politicians.  They are puppets, controlled by the central bankers and their cronies.
The central bankers are evil.  They have recently stolen tens of trillions of dollars from the rest of us, and have been using it to empower and enrich themselves and their cronies.  They own politicians, judges, regulators, media outlets, banks, corporations, precious metals, gems, etc. -- at your expense.
Using Bitcoin, instead of their fiat "play money" is a good way to dethrone them.

Okay.  That made me so CRINGE.  Good to know I'm not the only one.
Also, Schiff did not mention any of the significant problems people of yore encountered when using gold and/or silver as money.  Yes, gold is a good form of money, but it has it's own problems, some of them serious enough to have enticed the bulk of the population to switch to using "gold backed notes" instead.
Today: we have gold-coated tungsten, which requires special equipment and certain knowledge to be able to detect.
Gold is nice.  Bitcoin is even better, IMO. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 19:46:56

Actually, you can start by "playing around with" some "fun money" by "investing it" in Bitcoin, then holding onto to it "long term."

Here's my experience, so far.
Started with a Raspberry Pi.  Fresh Raspbian OS.  Followed the directions from here:
Messed up the /etc/fstab file.  Oops.  Unable to boot the poor, little Pi.
Scrubbed the SD card, reloaded the OS, re-performed instructions, left the fstab file alone.  Installed all kinds of things, cloned a copy of "bitcoin".  Tried to compile it.  ... The compiler choked!  Man, you hardly ever see that.  Told me to file a bug report against the compiler.  Went to dinner, had a good time.
A few days later, tried everything for a third time.  Ka-boom.  Right in the same place.
I'll just wait a few more days.  I'll double check that I didn't skip a step somewhere (it's possible).  Maybe find a different set of "how to" instructions".  This kind of thing is perfect for cold, rainy days...  not nice, summer afternoons.

There are many forms of money.  In the end, money is just a general purpose IOU.  Some forms of money are "good", but not all.  "Good" forms of money have all of these properties: Durable, divisible, portable, fungible, recognizable, rare, and difficult to counterfeit.
Most of today's money, fiat currencies, are not "good" money.
Bitcoin, like gold, has all seven of the necessary properties.

Letting people sell "pretend" Bitcoin won't grow the market cap.
I don't trust that those ETFs will actually buy very many "real" BTC.  They'll just do like they've been doing with "paper gold" and sell hundreds or maybe thousands of paper BTC for every actual BTC in existence.
Do you want people to buy "fake/pretend/paper" BTC?  Or do you want them to own the real thing so that when (not if) the USD dies, they'll at least have \_something\_??

Do you realize that governments are beyond broke, sort of by design?  Do you realize that it's just a matter of time until the next financial crisis hits?
Do you know that the stage is already set for the next financial crisis to be even bigger than the prior one?  It will be so big that we are likely to see the death of "money" has most of us have come to know it.
That's right.  Did you know that the average lifespan of a fiat currency is 27 years?  Do you know how long ago the USD was taken off of the gold standard?
Do you trust the government?  The politicians?  When the shit hits the fan, and it will, they're not going to rob the ultra-rich, because they are owned and operated by the ultra-rich.  The won't be able to rob the poor - they aint got nothin to rob.  They'll come after you and your stupid ETF.  They'll tell the EFT to fork a big chunk of it over, and they will.
You have been warned, my friend.  I tell you this as a stranger, with a heart full of brotherly love.  Please don't just take my word for it.  Do your own research, like I did.  Then you'll know, and hopefully you'll join me in warning others before it's too late.

Metcalfe's "Law" is a joke.
Let's say there's a popular social media web site with millions of users signed up.  At one point, early in the history of the web site, the tenth user, Billy, joins the site.  Billy is 10 percent of the users of that site.  The site's user base grew by 11 percent.  Later, the ten millionth user joins, Billy's grandmother.  She's only one-ten-millionth of the users.  The user base grew by about one millionth of one percent - an insignificant amount compared to when Billy joined.
Yet, Metcalfe's "Law" says that grandma has 10,000,000,000,000 TIMES the "effect" as Billy did.
Gresham's Law is not a joke.  It says that when people have two kinds of money, and one is better than the other, people will hoard (HODL) the better money and spend the other.  Gresham's law does not "explain what Bitcoin can be used for."  Still, if you read the article, there's a nice paragraph to explain: 


Then there's this rubbish:


"Proprietary value"?  I had to look that term up:


Hello?  Bitcoin is not a company with a new, patented technology.  **Bitcoin is a new kind of money.**
"...fixing a problem"?  How about central bankers stealing from the rest of us?  How about asking the people who had money in Cyprus banks what "problem" Bitcoin could have fixed for them?  How about asking people in Venezuela right now what kinds of serious problems Bitcoin can fix?
Meanwhile, **the USD is already doomed, blockchains or not.**  Invest in Bitcoin because of that, because something is going to replace the USD when it collapses, so how about something good and fair?

There's really no need for trading.  Each trade has risk and a fee.  Eventually, the fees and risk win, and the frequent trader loses, like any other gambler who believes they know how to "beat the house".
Long term, on average the price of BTC more than doubles every year.  If that isn't enough ROI for you, you're fucked up, crazy, mentally ill - and there's no cure.
All people need to do is **buy and hold, long term.**  So far, patience has been greatly rewarded; I see no reason for that long term trend to change at this time or any time soon.

Inflation is theft.
Money is just general purpose IOUs.  On a USD bill it even says, "ALL DEBTS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE".   Suppose you are a farmer, and one of your crops is going to be a good one, but a bit late.  You need supplies.  Normally you'd trade quantities of your crop for the supplies, but your crop is late this time.  So you write an IOU -- you promise a certain amount of crop.  You end up writing 10 IOUs.  No problem.  Not yet.
The next day, somebody trades an IOU from you for some gold coins from a banker in town.  **The banker then creates 5 copies of your IOU, without your permission.**  Later, after you harvest the crop, people show up to cash in their IOUs, including the banker.  Can you see how the banker is "stealing" some of your crop?
This is pretty much what central bankers do when they create fiat currency from thin air.  They steal actual wealth from the rest of us.

This includes, but is not limited to claims of being backed by gold, real estate, oil, a fiat currency...

You try it out.  You enter one trillion dollars and click save.  Done.  You go out and start buying stuff: real estate, precious metals, stocks, bonds, yachts, private jets, media outlets...
Wow!  That was great.  So you bump your balance up to five trillion.  And so on.
(This isn't EXACTLY how central banks work, but it's close enough to illustrate my point.)
So, now you typed numbers into a computer, and obtained stuff -- actual wealth.  You did no work.  You took no risk.  Where did all your stuff come from?  The rest of us -- you stole it from us.  In effect, you counterfeited money, which is illegal because it is theft and morally wrong -- yet this is pretty much what the central banks have been doing.
Look up/study: hyperinflation, debt monetization, quantitative easing, etc.
Bitcoin cannot be created by banksters merely typing numbers into their computers.

The central banks have create many tens of trillions of dollars worth of their fiat "play money" since the prior financial crisis.
They create all the money they want from thin air, backed by nothing.  This amounts to theft, by the way.

You can't have a real (and viable) blockchain without a "coin" (reward).

Yeah, but the power of the ghost of the dead rancher, often seen just after sundown along a less-popular mountain biking trail, not far from a popular mountain biking trail.  Once there was an OWL.  That OWL HOOTED, not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES.
I swear I heard the owl hoot exactly three times while I beheld the image of the old rancher floating exactly four feet above the trail before me while I stopped to catch my breath at the top of a steep climb, near his grave site.
Two years later, the price of 1 BTC is exactly TEN TIMES the price it was on that wonderful, unearthly event.

Tell him you're reporting him to the FBI.  Also mention that the FBI is extremely thorough, so he won't be hearing from them right away - no - but later, when he least expects it, they nab him, probably in a public place.  They'll have him on the floor and handcuffed before he realizes anything is happening.  "They WILL get you.  Not today or tomorrow, but eventually, and when they do, you'll end up in jail for a long, long time."

We've been given a precious gift: Decentralized money which allows us freedom from trusting banksters and other third parties, money which cannot be confiscated by, say, the government.

Experience.  Other peoples' experiences.  Louis Rukeyser and many of his guests.  Facts from books, web sites, videos.
Exchanges exist to get in and out.  Your logic flawed.  Just because something exists doesn't make it a good thing to use.  Just because some other people are doing some activity, that doesn't make that activity wise.
When to act?
Buy when you're out of debt and have an emergency (liquid) cash cushion saved up -- enough to pay all your bills for one full year (two years, even better).  When you don't have to borrow to invest.  When you can afford to have your investment funds tied up, locked up, underwater, upside-down for two years or more.   Don't invest heavily in things you don't understand.
You think you have some secret sauce, some magic formula -- well, you don't.  If you did, you'd be USING IT, you'd be eating your own dogfood if it was so tasty, but you're not.  If you are, you're not making money from your own "get rich" thing.

ETF's seem like a "wolf in sheep's clothing" to me.  Why?  Because customers will give their fiat money to centralized middlemen who will then give them a "printed" statement claiming, "Yeah, your \*\*bitcoin\*\* is worth $XXX,XXX.XX".
People will be trusting those middlemen to buy and store actual Bitcoin for them.  Should those middlemen be trusted?  One way to answer that might be to look at the "paper gold" market.  Last I checked, there are literally  **hundreds of ounces of "paper gold" for every ounce of real, physical gold**.
In other words, they're not buying gold, keeping it in vaults.  They're misleading people.  Eventually, this kind of "house of cards" collapses, and the unwise investors find out - **too late** \- that they don't actually own any gold.
Is it unreasonable to extend this to Bitcoin?  Seems reasonable to me.  We'll end up with over one billion "paper Bitcoins" being represented by just a few million actual BTC.  Eventually, it collapses, and investors find out they don't really own and Bitcoin, they've been screwed.
Look at the price of gold over the last five years.  Not too impressive.  Not a reflection of reality, IMO.  We're likely to see a similar facade in Bitcoin unless we start educating the general public to **buy actual Bitcoin and store them in a wallet/address for which they control the private key(s).**

It's a great time to buy IF:
1. You are out of debt
2. You have an emergency (liquid) cash cushion saved up (enough to pay all your bills for a full year)
3. You have money that you won't need for two years or more
4. You plan on buying and holding, long term
5. You don't invest heavily until you have a basic understanding of Bitcoin and know how to properly store it in your own wallet
So far, long term on average, Bitcoin's price has more than doubled each year.  There is no need to day trade.  Patient owners/investors have been well rewarded so far.
