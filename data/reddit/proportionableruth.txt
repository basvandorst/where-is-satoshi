if it's not too much trouble for you. What would be an adequate amount to motivate you
to find him?
Necessities like this do happen from time to time for a person in my position. I have
others I can turn to, but it is always good to have options and you are close to the case
right now. Hopefully this is something you are open to and can be another aspect of our
business relationship.

ah yes, the *only* reason people die from heroin is because its in the black market, no potential for adverse effects if we just sold it on every street corner to every kid and out of work coal miner.

As an expat, you're not obliged. Being a US citizen is a choice. If you would like to no longer receive the protections of US citizenship to avoid taxes, that is easily done.
Also, any taxes you pay to your country of residence (you know, to fund those roads, schools, healthcare systems) are deductible from your US tax bill, although you are still obliged to file US taxes (unless you choose to no longer be citizen)

we would be so much better off without roads and airports then, you're so right.

His only defense was saying that he wasn't actually dread pirate roberts (Even though the DPR wallet and the wallet found on his laptop, the one this post is even about, were the same). 
If you still somehow choose to believe his defense, that would also mean he did not even run silkroad, had no bitcoin of his seized by the government, and had nothing to do with the operation of silkroad. If all of that is true, why are people like you worshiping him, when his only defense is that DPR and him cannot be positively linked?

Then you guys should make an honest argument. 
When you say taxation is theft, what you really mean is public schools, roads, airports, and clean air are theft.

"public schools, roads, the internet, cancer research, health insurance for children is theft."
This is what you really mean, but that argument sure would be less effective.

You admit he started silk road, but deny he is behind the pseudonym that started silk road because that pseudonym ordered 3 hits. That is some grade A doublethink right there.
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:50:41
you aren't even arguing that that isn't true, though, just that it was inadmissible as evidence.
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:48:59
you're right, he also ordered hits.
