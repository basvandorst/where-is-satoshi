There's nothing wrong with realizing profits, but your claiming the fees and confirmation times are problems of Bitcoin specifically make little sense. They are technically correct, however, it is like blaming a specific book for wear and tear of paper. 
You first need to use the book, in order for this problem to arise (discounting the effect of time which, of course, doesn't apply to Bitcoin), but that's just how paper works, it would be silly to point at the book.
It's the same story with distributed ledgers. Once you get to understand how the technology works in more depth, you slowly start realizing its potential brilliance of doing certain things (immutability, security, censorship resistance), but complete inefficiency of doing others.   
*Potential* because the value of the technology doesn't come from the technology alone. Blockchains are generally pretty much useless, even with the right code their value/real world use is not a given. There are other necessary requirements, most importantly, the network must be truly distributed and the processing power securing it must be so significant, that it, in fact, does become secure (note that meeting those conditions is extremely hard, which is why the *brilliant* part truly applies to exactly one coin, no matter how many times the rest mentions "decentralization" and other stupid buzzwords in their whitepapers--nothing even comes close). 
Back to my point, distributed ledgers are insanely inefficient at handling large quantities of transactions. There's no way around it, the distributed system works a certain way and that ensures the good stuff. These are the necessary sacrifices. You only start to notice them at a certain point, of course. From the simple point of view, it could seem there are dozens of altcoins with no scaling problems whatsoever. This is what people often don't know/understand, yet becomes clear once you get the fundamentals of the technology--first we need some scale before scaling becomes a problem.  
We already have great, very efficient ways of paying smaller amounts with generally no fees, distributed ledgers are not here to help with that. They fundamentally can't, no matter what we do with them. 
What Bitcoin can do is give us the good stuff--hard, secure money without government--in my mind something imperative for our future society, on top of which we fit what we already can do extremely well--additional layers (and no, it cannot ever work the other way around).   
Also, additional layers don't just mean variants of Lightning. Almost every place that trades vast amounts of bitcoin today does so off-chain for the most part (the only on-chain TXs on exchanges are people buying in and out).
There are very few instances where final settlement is actually needed, but when it is, the good stuff Bitcoin offers is invaluable (nothing like it exists today)--mostly because it also offers to back all the other layers. 
This is the ultimate solution which preserves all the game-changing and imperative properties of Bitcoin. Once we start curing the symptoms by increasing the block size, we're not only delaying the inevitable (if mass adoption happens, scaling can't keep up at all), but more importantly, we're forgetting and sacrificing the things we need for something we already have. Only the new product will be much less efficient, as distributed ledgers simply can't compete at this game.   
Stop chasing shadows and start focusing on what's important, especially when it's right under our nose.

I don't dismiss lack of control over the economy as a "downside", I see it as a big upside. I want the people in control to be the people putting their necks on the line. With Bitcoin, this is a given, with centralized economies of scale, moral hazard is.
Also, I am advocating for Bitcoin, not gold. I am simply using gold as an example because it is the only medium that shares SOME of the important attributes.
 
And I see deficit-funding of wars as extremely short-sighted. 
EDIT: I'd appreciating you not strawmaning my arguments. Especially by later editing your posts, rather than replying to mine.   
Stimulating the economy is curing the symptoms. How is trying to find ways to never get there short-sighted? I see it as the opposite. 
Also, I have never said money is only for making people rich. My point was that there can exist money that actually appreciates and lowers people's time preference. The last generations don't knew what that is.

Bitcoin would need to lose what makes it so valuable and imperative to our (future) society--its completely immutable monetary policy.   
What could cause such a thing? There were times when Bitcoin was vulnerable, but those are far gone. So the real answer is **nothing**, at least nothing I can imagine.   
I don't care about the short term price. If BTC drops 90%, I will just buy more. A medium with such unique properties (extreme scarcity: strictly limited supply; extremely high **global stockpiles : annual production** rate for the future...) will always be invaluable.

OK, I'm done here. I have better things to do with my time than trying to explain things to a clueless sophist.

Bloomberg just bumped up their 2018 expected price from $11k to $14k. However, I'd be careful with this sort of information. I wouldn't pay any real attention to the "economy experts", other than it gives Bitcoin some more exposure. The more time I spend in this space, the more I get convinced that there are no experts, only good salesmen.

If people expect something to rise forever, it doesn't mean it's a bubble. There might be a very good reason for the increase in value. Sure, *pumps* could be considered bubbles (as could other *irrational* behavior) but that's not really that relevant.   
On the other hand, if I say "copper is money now", the value goes way up. Is it a bubble? Yes, because copper is incredibly easy to produce and the increase in demand will cause supply inflation (bubble -&gt; burst). 
If you say gold/Bitcoin is money, there won't be any noticeable supply inflation and thus no debasement. It means the price is not artificially high, the intrinsic value simply increased. Not a bubble. That's what I was trying to explain.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:31:03
I know the definition, I just don't think it's very good.  
The anatomy of a market bubble: increased demand causes a sharp rise in prices, which drives further demand, raising prices further, incentivizing increased production and increased supply which inevitably brings prices down punishing everyone who bought at a price higher than the usual market price. Investors in the bubble are fleeced, while producers of the asset benefit immensely. For copper and almost every other commodity in the world, this dynamic has held true for most of recorded history, consistently punishing those who choose these commodities as money by devaluing their wealth and impoverishing them in the long run, and returning the commodity to its natural role as a market good, and not a medium of exchange.  
For anything to function as a good store of value, it has to beat this bubble trap.

The fact that a technology is tangible has nothing to do with its inherent value. Look at the internet.  
Bitcoin's real value has profound reasons, it's not a "speculation". Same as it isn't a "bubble" - hard money is immune to bubbles by its definition. Does that mean it's past the stage where it can drop 90% overnight? No, it just means it isn't a bubble.

Until now, humanity has ever known only one sound money - gold. Central banks ruined it and forced people onto their easy money (easy to create in large quantities) backed by nothing. On top of that, gold has some limitations: very difficult, expensive and risky to move etc. Plus, almost ~20% of all above-ground gold is now owned by central banks.   
And now comes Bitcoin with its completely unique properties. The fact that Bitcoin's monetary policy is, at this point, completely immutable makes it alone invaluable (supply is fixed and will stay fixed, nobody can ban it, censor it, control it, and despite all the efforts and proclamations how certain things would kill BTC, its value continues to rise) and one of a kind. As opposed to the other altcoins.
Bitcoin is the complete antithesis to the current Keynesian over-consumer, high time preference paradigm. Finally there is a medium that is a great store of value, you can use it to save money so that it will appreciate and you can spend only when you really need to. You can see that when hodling Bitcoin, each time you consider spending some, there's this voice telling you that maybe you don't really need to spend here or that you should immediately replace those bitcoins. That's great, that's how civilizations are made - by saving and consequent abundance. 
  
The "coin creation" (mining) itself requires adequate electricity expenses and considering the attributes I've just described, to me no cost is high enough to get a medium like this. If all of this isn't real value to someone, I don't know what is!
That's why I think that the whole debate about high fees/long confirmation times completely misses the point. None of this matters. Bitcoin simply isn't solving the problem that we don't have effective ways to exchange money! We do. If you want fast micro-payments, Bitcoin's distributed network where every transaction has to go through thousands or tens of thousands of nodes can never compete against the centralized systems like VISA, MasterCard or layer PayPal (not that it transfers money, it just credits accounts, but is much less expensive/time intensive). That's not the purpose and it's not even close to the real reasons behind Bitcoin importance and value.   
Bitcoin is this amazing tool - money without a government (or any authority) - a priceless settlement network where you can send transactions worth of millions and billions of dollars across any borders with $2 fees in under an hour with absolute safety and security. Micro-payments and lightning fast transactions are not important and using Bitcoin for these things is a huge and inefficient overkill (like trying to use a jet to get your groceries). All of them can still be done with our current extremely effective systems backed by Bitcoin. Plus, higher layer solutions can also help solve some of these problems. I'd like to see LN work, of course it would be nice, but by no means necessary.

I was talking about how money that appreciates and rewards saving creates abundance in a society and allows it to use the resources effectively when truly needed (which has many other benefits along the road).  
My claim is that today's mind-boggling Keynesian approach (centralization, regulation and consequent risk asymmetry--those who take them don't pay for them) creates over-spending fragile (huge debts) consumer society that is being incentivized/forced to spend money pretty much instantaneously (or invest in something more risky) because of debasement/eventual blow ups from hidden risk accumulation (credit bubbles etc). That is how some of the greatest civilizations fell.
This is getting tedious... If you read Rothbard's [Economic Depressions: Their Cause and Cure] ( that might give you a more comprehensive idea about most bases behind my claims.

For the context of my post where I was trying to explain Bitcoin's monetary policy and why it beats this bubble trap. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:44:05


That's the thing, it couldn't. There is no way the monetary policy of Bitcoin can change now, no way. Once it was vulnerable, that time is far, far gone. The fact we got to this point is miracle to me, and now, this miracle is here to stay. Whether you like it or not. Get familiar with how the system works and, who gets all the benefit. That will explain why the "economists" don't agree with me (I take that as a compliment).
You know, you can go ahead and change some of the Bitcoin code right now, but chances are nobody will use it, because it will be crap and won't benefit other people in the network. That's why it's great. Again, nobody can change it. On the other hand, if you're a central banker, you make that decision, you decide what is useful for the people. A world of difference.
Look at [this picture]( of the global stockpiles / annual production ratio. A good store of value means you have a medium that can effectively transfer purchasing power from the present to the future. In the long run, only a strictly limited supply and very restricted production can get you that. Bitcoin is the hardest money ever created, it's the cheapest way to buy the future. There is a reason why the 21 million hard cap exists and there's a reason limit why the mining difficulty adjusts with time (to the value). 
Why? For simplicity's sake imagine that the government decides that Bitcoin is official money sometime in the future. Suddenly, everyone needs/wants bitcoins - production, value and demand skyrocket. But the amount we can produce (relative to the existing supply) is still so negligible (due to the extremely high ratio from the picture) that it won't be negatively consequential for the value. As you can see, gold is the only other medium that shares this property. Anything else, even silver, is prone to supply inflation, bubbles and inevitable busts. 
You see, it's the producers who always get their pockets full. For them, easy money is great. It goes like this: raise something's value (e.g. make it money), start high production &amp; inflate the supply, make tons of profits by selling for that artificially high price, let the eventual blow up/debasement ruin savings of people holding the money. The producers don't care (of course the central banks don't really want the entire system blowing up (they still have to live in it), I am just illustrating what incentives they--the producers--have and therefore why the system works like it does).
As for gold, it was very solid before the FED/central banks and its self-enriching Keynesian experiment. There's a whole time period called La Belle Époque, the golden age, when the west experienced incredible economical and technological growth. The monetary systems (under gold) were extremely stable, pretty much all instability came from the outside--mostly wars and political regimes.
The post-FED era of gold was much worse, but it wasn't gold that was the problem...
As to "not everybody shares your viewpoint" - I am not forcing my viewpoint onto anyone. Nor do I pretend to represent anyone else other than myself (except maybe those people who agree with me). 
I believe I've said enough. I don't owe my time and history lessons to random people on the internet. Hope I made my point clear. Draw your own conclusions but do it based on information, not narrative.

Why might that be... Perhaps because Bitcoin, unlike Myspace, Digg and AIM, gets stronger--more decentralized and therefore more robust and secure--with each increase in its network.  
The **technology itself** directly benefits because of its inherent structure! 
The network effect of Bitcoin is an entirely different animal and your analogy is about as useless as comparing Bitcoin to tulips!
