In fairness if it actually went to court and one side was given the rights over the name, it would probably be bitcoin cash, since the national institute for science and technology said that bitcoin cash was technically bitcoin.
The reasons that make btc bitcoin is ‘majority opinion during a transition’ which would be tougher to prove, unfortunately.
