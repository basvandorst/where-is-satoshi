Can you not transfer to GDAX and sell as much as you want into your USD wallet and then just withdraw the weekly limit?

Sounds like you used a credit/debit card. Coinbase has to pay a 3%ish transaction fee for that. You better believe they'll pass that on to you.
Use your bank for a lower fee. Just enjoy waiting 7 days for it to show in your account.

Just go to the bank and ask for coin sleeves. Tellers give them away happily rather than have to roll loose coin customers bring in.

Ask him why a piece of cotton/paper mash with ink in the shape of Ben Franklin on it is worth $100? It's not backed by anything of intrinsic value. It's accepted and understood as having value because everyone says it does and believes it does. How is BTC any different?
The argument only gets BETTER the deeper you drill into the discussion.

You can deposit from your bank, but can't use debit/credit. And you'll have to wait for the ACH to settle (7 days roughly).

I didn't say it was safer or more reliable than USD. It is (currently) significantly more risky. I would take issue with the statement that BTC is not currency. Currency is any non-good/non-service that can be exchanged for goods or services. Unless you're only including currencies accepted by governments as currencies. 
Edit: also the USD is insured, yes, but only the quantity is insured, not the value. If you have $250K in the bank and the USD has a period of massive hyperinflation which debases the currency, your $250K loses substantial purchasing power (value) even if the $250K number doesn't change. This is a much lower risk (currently) with USD than BTC, but the fundamentals are the same.

Are you (and your bank) in the US?

Mildly clever fish. 2/10

No, that would be barter. I said non-good/service for good/service. 
Securities fall outside this discussion.
A promise is ironically closer, and only someone who trusts you implicitly would consider that anywhere close to currency. 
In order to be a viable everyday currency, widespread adoption/acceptance is important. Acceptance of crypto is growing. Would you argue US Mint gold coins aren't currency? Good luck walking into 7-11 and buying your beer with a US Gold Eagle.

The first wave of mass public speculators ran out of cash?
