The USD didn't "tank" in 2008.  Annual inflation has been pretty steady for the past 2 decades.

Why the fuck are you investing if you have no income and little enough savings for the drop to "hurt".
You don't invest with money you might need soon, period.  The entire $5000 should be written off as unspendable unless it's invested in a **stable** and liquid asset.  Bitcoin is anything but that.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:33:05
The institutional investors cashing out at their expense certainly do.

How would that be any different if those markets were denominated in Bitcoin?  It wouldn't...
The only difference is, when shit hits the fan with a fiat currency, the central bank can take measures to keep the value of the currency itself semi-stable.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:29:44
Yeah, have fun with those transaction fees.
It's not that people have "lost sight" it's that it's completely insane to try to use Bitcoin that way at the moment.

Maintaining savings is not the same as "hodl"ing.  People save USD but they don't actively avoid doing anything that *isn't* saving with USD.  
In fact, the very purpose of inflation is to prevent people from just chucking all their money into a shoebox for 40 years.  It encourages investing.
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:29:53
You missed his point.  The very purpose of inflation is to drive behaviors like investing long-term in the economy to generate wealth, which benefits the entire society.
Hoarding doesn't benefit anyone but yourself.
And with IRAs, any kind of target date fund is going to rebalance towards more stable assets as you near retirement.

Because the ACH system was designed in the 1970s and that's just how it works.  There's no reason for it other than a lack of will to change ACH (because it's ancient and fragile, written in COBOL which few people understand anymore, and high risk) and a lack of will to replace it (because it's high risk, a massively expensive undertaking, and most people seem not to care too much about the delays).

1). Warren Buffet didn't invest in Theranos. No idea where you heard that but it's wrong.
2).  Nobody except for Tim Draper is standing out there telling everyone she shouldn't be charged with crimes she committed because she's "an innovator" which Tim Draper thinks are too important to be bound by laws like the rest of us plebs.
@_date: 2018-08-07 17:43:04
**You're the one claiming things.**  You claimed that Warren Buffett invested in them and now you're asking me to prove that he didn't.  Stupid.
  $10 says the reason you're trying to pass it off onto me is that you tried momentarily, realized that you *can't* back up your claims, and are trying to avoid looking bad.
But since you *insist*, the only information I can find about "Warren Buffet" and "Theranos" is him saying that they have a lot of big names on their board, and that he isn't interested in companies that go after investors just because they have big prestigious names.  So, yeah, I don't think he invested in Theranos.

AC causes your muscles to lock up, DC doesn't.  So if you grab hold of a live AC wire you might not be able to let go.
edit: AC and DC both cause muscles to lock up, but AC does so at 1/4 the current, and DC is more likely to convulse your hand away from the source.
The main problem back in the day was that live, exposed wires were everywhere.

This video does a good job of representing the typical arguments
@_date: 2018-06-16 14:17:46
It has nothing to do with DC being "dangerous" and in fact it's a little safer than AC.  The problem is that in the early days there was zero regulation and little experience so poorly done wiring could be incredibly dangerous, and nearly all of it was very poorly done by modern standards.
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:52:32
You completely misunderstand, then.
That has already been happening for a decade.  ASICs are far, far more power efficient than GPUs, which have also continued to get more power efficient.
But it doesn't matter, because as the hardware gets more powerful and efficient, the difficulty of mining also goes up, resulting in ever more work needing to be done to mine a block, resulting in the power usage remaining effectively the same.
@_date: 2018-06-16 15:41:25
Actual experimental evidence shows that it is not that cut and dried.  The threshold for muscle activation with AC 4 times lower.  DC is also more likely to cause a single convulsion which drives your hand away from the source, whereas AC is more likely to cause sustained convulsions.  
Beyond the gripping issue, AC is also way more likely to cause heart fibrillation than DC is, and at lower currents.

Lol.  What Venezuelan was like "nah, everything is totally fine" a couple years back?  Western leftists have a really skewed perspective on the realities of their socialist utopias.
Newsflash, when you base your entire economy around one product (oil), you're utterly at the mercy of demand for that product. 
This is why the US and Venezuela are not comparable.

It's a "private entity" in the same sense that the US Postal Service is a "private entity".
It is, legally speaking, a "nonprofit corporation".

Technically speaking it's the Department of the Treasury.  The Mint is underneath the DoT umbrella but only produces coinage, not paper money.
Also technically speaking while the Treasury produces the currency they do so under the dictates of the Federal Reserve.

There is an entire book written about this subject.  It's quite a good book, I recommend it.
It's not *just* that it didn't work - they committed massive fraud.  They both ran blood tests on commercial machines that they claimed was being tested on their own machines, and they tried to cover up the inaccurate results that their own machines were producing.  They set up a Potemkin Village for regulators and hid the actual lab and equipment that was being used for blood tests.  They falsified statistics.  They fired anyone that raised the slightest concern about what was going on and forced them to sign ridiculous NDAs on their way out the door.
