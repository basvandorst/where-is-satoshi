I have read some of his twitts. He did have some good intention of creating ethereum. But the real question is that how are you going to create such a stateless platform after you revealing your identity and by only work on it in a few western countries. Bitcoin successed because no one know where and whom it was come from beyond the cyber space。To assume the countries will not interfere you will be impossible. And if that is the case, politics will simply tear you apart like what they did to google.(otherwise it will be still in China instead of the sucking Baidu) eth. will then only serve the few west countries and the "decentralized idea" fails. Till now, i have not read any of this smart young man's solution have touched this central issue.

you over estimate miners' power. They are absolutely nothing without btc users !!!!! T price will drop to negative without their support as mining cost money. Neverthless, I do agree with you that 95% may never work. But history will eventually look for the critical point of change which will not need the majority's support at last - even it mean destroy of the old system !

@_date: 2017-03-19 07:25:08
one team, two team, three team... do not makes any sense! the thing makes real sense is the intention behind those teams. the core stand at the users' side, and BU stand at miners'(and I have long predicted some political power will stay behind the miners).  the  first one is more rational and foresight but less determined as it consider too much factors, and the later one carries definitely stronger will to enforce its police as it only consider the profit bound the current matters. Nevertheless, future will only favor one solution, as we do not need two "digital gold" to standardize our value system in the future.  Now it is not a situation to be judged by democracy nor decentralization/centralization. it is a situation to be only judged what the future really need.   Will you coinbase choose potential users as the future, or you believe concrete miner and the political power stand behind it will win?

"To give back the power to working people from the old dictator" I believe it is just another phrase of "decentralization" - to liberate users from the wrongful centralized authority. As a child, it is not that I believe them, it is because I have nothing to believe and was scraed to death if I did not join their hallucination. But once you take these mental drug, it is hard to give up. More or less, I believe this also happens on you and so do others people's childhood. As a leader, Satoshi stop bitcoin from destroying by cut the link between wikileak once. Nevertheless, these politician simply does not give up, and is raising the fear again. And so, the hallucination was finally raised.

You assumption is based on that gov. will act together to destroy it, but that will never happen and Trump are just keep destroying the hormony. Chinese gov. will never destroy sth which can benefit other. Since 75% are mined in china, destroy it just mean the country will lose an huge asset to trade with other country. What they are doing is try to gain control, so anyone who wants to use it will have to do them the favor to help the country(or someone's own interests sometimes) intead of just use it as a hedge or a tool to take money away from the country. But since btc's trading function is still intact(like the segwit), and the progress is still hindered by its decentralized nature, the dogfight will continue for some time.
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:09:34
Credit card, e-mail &amp;so on just directly bond you to central authority like gov. , bank. and so on. Like chinese gov can one day say that it will stop you bitcoin user from withdraw bitcoin from public exchanger because they "assume" you are committing the crime like money laudering. Neither storj  or any user can stop this incident from happening as long as we are all living under central authority. If you storj really want to make the profit, you have to bond your coin directly to btc without using any real world money. And of course get rid of the user- registering step ! Btw, this is what siacoin is doing.

Ambiguous talk, I am afraid. Assume that our Chinese gov. have just print enough cash to exchange most of coined mined in China. Since 75% are mined in China, will you call that "majority"? And how about it does not want the "economic", but to deliberately disintegrate the community in order to gain control?

BU does not solve anything, I am afraid. It is based on the illusion, (hope not deliberately)that people will not attack the vulnerability of the transaction for profit, if there is one. And it is exactly what make btc success at the first place by avoiding it. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:34:18
Users do not care if their transactions are done by miners or third party, as long as it is still bitcoin. What they really care are confirm time, stability, and transaction fee. This is exactly what LN&amp;sgwt promised to bring. It reduce confirm time to seconds, lower the transaction fee to nearly 0, without sacrifice the stability as the larger blocks are all kicked into the "2nd layer". It largely reduce the difficulty to build a third party service( not confused with "the 3rd party trust" as your bitcoin is still in your pocket), so many more competitors will compete with existing service provider like coinbase, blockchain.info. Therefore the stability of 2nd layer is expected to be finally solved, and 3rd layer is ahead of us...... But there is one downside of core's solution, the hand of btc's future will slip away from miners' hand, which is exactly what BU come from.

You guys really have a simple mind ! The ones that are benefited are neither the miner, nor the exchanger. It is the owners in bitcoin-friendly country ! Holding these much virtual currency without using them simply won't make sense! And Bitcoin can not be usesd anywhere in China! Even if the volume does say something,  the speculation must be started by western capitals!!

That's side chain and secondary layers' works. There will only be more miners.
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:40:12
Take a look at my comments before, it explained everything. Do not worry though. If 8888 is the peak, that means the capitals have bought some coins around the peak. It may just be a sign to draw gambler's attention, and next peak will soon surpass it. If that's not the case, the price at least won't plummet like 2013. These capitals are fast cash lover at last.
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:17:44
Let's be clear: These Chinese gamblers are good for bitcoins' future, as they are the ultimate force raise the price. Since this is their only desk to do play their game, I highly doubt that it will plummet on 2013 without gov.'s intervention. The real question is that how important is the coin for the gov., when and if the gov will take control on the miners. The answer to that question is of course that" will bitcoin become gold". After developed for three years, there is a chance that gov. take control not long. And if that happened, these capitals with the speculation will just cease the game, the price will eventually be stable. This is the happy ending we all wanted but there is still doubts. 100 bitcoin owners are not the problem, since the number are larger than the number of the superpowered- countries. Neverthless they will play a role in next step.

A little advice from another startup: I have already been doubt that bank is really necessary for virtual crypto-currency in the future. What you really need is lightning-network and segrated witness, google it.
@_date: 2016-12-30 06:26:11
The concept of lightning network is actually the thing to let bitcoin make sense at this time, and side chain makes sense only if bitcoin's potential would reach at certain level in the future.
@_date: 2016-12-21 09:10:14
I have spent one third of my life in the western countries, and all I can tell you is that we are not that much different as many imgained...... 
Though, I should say that I don't think the "decentralization" Bitcoin should bring to us is the same as you mean. 
First of all, you should be clear that centralization is not for monopoly or dictator but to utilize the resources in a most efficient way, at least for most of the people. The only reason why Chinese miner took the major market share is that the IT industry in China is so centralized. Therefore they can have the most economical hardware and technician. Any boss who took the block off first along the way of building their social network, will be accepted by the centralized Chinese society. Then him will be the only one that can utilize as much the resources from the society as possible, and promised to keep utilizing them in a most efficient centralized way.  The rest of the players will only left to either quit the game or were subdued to join the first one's company. It really doesn't matter what the company is about, or what personality of the boss has.  In fact, most of the bosses I saw in China knew little about the tech, and also care little about the "paradigm shift" their company will bring to our world. The only thing they cared about is synchronizing with the centralized society, and taking away the blockage of building social connection as much as possible. Believe it or not, this game has been played for thousands of years, and it doesn't matter which industries you are in nowadays. All do my respect, believing in these miners will bring the "decentralizing" is like believing Chairman Mao's revolution is really to liberate the suffered workers. Nevertheless, you can not deny that his centralized power did promote China advanced greatly in many area for the first time, after the scarced resources were centralized. 
However, no contract can be made without sacrifice. Higher efficiency  always comes with less “lifespan”.  And here it brings the true value of “decentralization” of Bitcoin – perish the declined centralized organization, so new vital centralized organizations can be sprouted. And yes, I do mean the absolute political power only defined geology is becoming outdated!
While our minds are colliding in Reddit after Aaron’s death, the most Chinese are still in their self-indugence behind the Great Wall. That is to say, the real “great fire-wall”is not really online, but was built in their mind by themselves. It was built to protect their greed, indolence, low self-estem, their stupid little tricks that were used to fool their own people, and mainly – the fear to admit the lifespan of their centralized political power is going to an end! Pollution, unreasonable high real-estate price, the blood-sucking state-owned firms without any profit, and the retarded famous TV show are only the phenomenon. It is for the “glorious” owner and their obsessed followers not be tainted by the outsiders which include their own ones who want a change. It is then bitcoin responsibility to gather the force worldwide to bring down this great wall and perish their centralized power, so everyone can have more chance to build and decentralize new and better centralized organization for more and prosper future !

This is why they just can’t keep their hands out of the market : pushing community from uasf to segwit and to the signature in the future . Although Jihan&amp; his followers set their timebomb after the centralized farm,  core have just do the same thing only in a different way. Both of them violate satoshi’s vision about btc.

Actually you are wrong, 99.9% Chinese (include middle class) do not know what bitcoin really is and what it will become. If you only talk about investing, Chinese simply do not like to invest sth they are familiar!
What you really want to talk about are the Chinese who want gamble. At this time, the peak reaches "8888" yuan , which means "money, money, money, money" in Chinese. As I predicted, this is an obviously capital's speculation to draw the gambler. It works only because the gamble is not permitted in China.
For the miners , rise like this will draw gov.'s attention, which could lead to the plummet like 2013.  What they want is the price rise continuously.About black market, this topic is too navie for me. All I can say is that bitcoin is the worst tool to do the money laundering.....
The bubble will eventually burst at some point. Although the final price will be higher than the price in 2013 after the plummet, it will only be decided by how much bitcoin worth for the next speculation in the future.

This is actually possible, but not practical at this time. You can modify hash function and make a derivative version, but there is no "random mathmatical" formula can be made by human, so contentious hard forks will eventually destroy the price and its credit. A solution to it should require the help from quantum superposition which can be consider truly random. Neverthless, it is not practical at this time as I mentioned. A comprised solution can be made by let AI to help change the encryption in a way which can not be understood by people, and google just prove that it is possible. Then a new issue will raise, who should have the license to maintain the AI ?
