Yeah, i have much more money invested in traditional asset classes. Why sell bitcoin for 2K in cash? If I was really in a jiffy I would for sure sell some stock for 2K as oppose to selling bitcoin.

This doesn't answer your question but Many profitable miners use cheap electricity sources - like hydro. And have convienent cooling systems as well which cut down on the environmental costs

Studies have shown that people who use bitcoin also are much more likely to try other cryptocurrencies as well. There are some whack coins out there that you can pump and dump right into your veins. In fact there are places you can go on the internet to exchange bitcoin for these dangerous coins.
