Buy with the money you willing to lose. Write down the pass phrase in a paper and keep it in a safe place (multiple places is better). Don’t check the price every 10 minutes. Hodl it till 2021.
Yes, you may lose everything you invested. But if not, it will generate N times return.
Maximum lose: 100%
Maximum profit: N%

At 2040, bitcoin will be the common currency. So, you can only use it to BUY anything, but cannot SELL.

Just hodl it. You can tell the same to people who bought at $170k in the future. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:58:15
It will be come an universal store of value, there is no relevant price at that moment. Because money (fiat currency) is already dead. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:45:45
Ignore the market, just HODL for long term. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:50:26

I think checkout GitHub and start to contribute, it’s a good start. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:52:56
It will be great. But I will not use it. Because I will not trust a closed source app running on the closed platform. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:02:17
Nice one!! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:24:20

@_date: 2017-11-26 04:59:30
Go to $10,000 by this year
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:18:01
How about they asking how to mine bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:55:08
At that time, BTC price will high enough to make the transaction fee as incentive for miner to keep mining.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:00:34
Pay by bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:03:11
$1k - huh?
$2k - what is bitcoin?
$4k - crazy...
$8k - where can I buy bitcoin?
(considering... waiting for dip...)
$10k - It’s bubble!!!

@_date: 2017-11-26 23:56:13
HODL and prepare to the moon
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:00:23
It’s depends on the scale. If you have few hundreds of bitcoin, maybe you can start with OTC trading. However, the main issues of setting up an exchange are security and regulation.
