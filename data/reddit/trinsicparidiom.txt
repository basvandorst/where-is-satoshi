Given their resources I'd upgrade you remark from ludicrous to possible. I always go back to who has the most to gain from destroying a thing.

Thats probably what the establishment is trying to cause. Fear, uncertainty and doubt about Bitcoin by encouraging the worst experience possible by everyone involved so it gets killed. 
Make no mistake, the banking industry has no intention of loosing the monopoly over currency. If you get involved in Bitcoin, be prepared to research this shit and the people involved beyond acceptable lengths, I would bet the CIA is involved in creating any and all disinformation about this form of currency as well.

My thought is to question where the authority is coming from to send the letters in the first place, and see where that takes you. Too many people assume too much authority to the government. They have nothing other than what we give them.
There is a huge red flag when you see something like this:


If they are trying to silence people on these letters it usually means they have no authority to be doing what the they are doing and are trying to hide it.

Was it hostgator? I dont like hosting companies flipping a switch like that without warning and I think it needs to be known that customers shouldn't tolerate that kind of response with out some kind of warning ahead of time and some time to make arrangements.
