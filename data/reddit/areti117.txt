Hello Mr. Powell,
I'm an ex-user of CAVirtex who's now attempting to log into my new Kraken account. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to log into my account with Kraken and expressed my concern with the support team. 
It's been **seven** I've received two emails, still haven't been able to log into my Kraken account.
I'm trusting your organization with thousands of my hard-earned money, I expect better service. This is causing me unwarranted stress and anxiety.
I'm very disappointed, is there a 1-800 number I can call to have this resolved right away?
Thank you - I trust you will help.

In fact I have two ticket numbers: 98194 and 96847.
Alex and Linda we're helping me initially and then I didn't here back from them.
I have still not been able to log back into my Kraken account.
I appreciate your help here, I'm looking forward to logging into my Kraken account..
