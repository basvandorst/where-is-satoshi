Is it true though ?
It does need growth and compound growth (like compound interest). But not exponential growth, I think, that's a lot more.

Higher than bip-9-segwit chart I mentioned before, so maybe I got it wrong after all. I suspect some/many are not using one full node but multiple and they haven't all upgraded yet ?
@_date: 2017-02-26 08:59:22
The real question is: when will Bitcoin get SegWit and LN ? When will technologies that people have worked on actually be adopted by the Bitcoin network.
Where is the incentive for the miners to adopt this ? The miners are making a ton of money right now. LN depends on being able to broadcast on the Bitcoin network and having it be possible to be included in the blockchain to have things happen in a timely fashion (not needed for most, but possible if needed). Who will pay the transaction fee if needed ?
@_date: 2017-02-26 10:31:53
Euh, that's fullnodes, miners is what you need, actually a lot of them.
I'm actually watching this:
The tooltip says: "In order to lock-in there must be 95% support within a single activation period. There are a total of 26 possible activation periods."
Edit: An activation period is 14 days, 2 years in total, started in 15 November 2016, so round about 13 November 2018.
Edit 2: Here is the full list of all the mining pools:
Based on the above list you can get the blocks and look it up.
Someone should make a list of who have upgraded and who haven't and make a website about that.

Does anyone know of any other ATMs ?
PS The Dutch also founded New York, or New Amsterdam as it was called at the time. The English took it from the Dutch in a surprise attack with 4 ships if I remember correctly. The surprise attack was part of a much larger coordinated surprise attack around the world in different regions/territories.
It wasn't just the name of the city that was renamed, but also parts of the city like Wallstreet and Brooklyn.
If I'm not mistaken, there is also a funny fact: the Dutch and English head honcho at the time were at war, but they were also brothers.

I suspect Bitcoin might be the gold of cryptocurrencies, because the way things are going with Bitcoin I think some other cryptocurrency will be used as a daily currency. The alternative would be if Bitcoin does not get adopted that Bitcoin goes to 'zero'.

Didn't really mean they would spend that much time, just download the source. Make a single change to disable segwit and compile.
But you are probably right about that.
@_date: 2017-02-26 16:35:29
I doubt I can find a simple way to check that, though. I don't have the list blockchain.info has to identify these people. Maybe if I ran a Bitcoin client for a long time I could figure out their IP-addresses or something like that.
The version numbers/bits are in the list. Most of them claim they are 20000000 which would mean older code than segwit version. I've seen a few odd versions like (30000000) which I would assume are non-core versions, but not many.
Wouldn't be surprised that people that don't like change like segwit but who do want security updates would just patch their code.
@_date: 2017-02-26 11:32:37
I'm also kind of curious, I would love to know if the Bitcoin network can solve their problems. I want to know where I need to place my money long term.
Edit: I also don't yet know which bit to check for SegWit, but I could look that up of course.

@_date: 2017-03-16 19:23:39


Euh, not really, you can use 3rd parties (they actually called them 'payment processors' in a presentation).
The miners are making profits now and they get uncertainty if they choose SegWit. Seems pretty easy choice for them. They might even be thinking: if SegWit is such a good idea an other crypto currency will adopt it. An other possibility is: some are waiting of Litecoin adopting it first.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:06:36
Here is my thoughts on that: if it doesn't break anything, why would you need a soft-fork ?
When do you get a "SegWit"-block ? That would be when one of the miners which has SegWit enabled mines a block with SegWit data in it. All full nodes accept them, all miners will accept them.
When do you get an invalid "SegWit"-block ? That would be when one of the miners which does not support SegWit mines a block which has data in it which is invalid by SegWit rules (if everyone plays by the rules, this is less likely to happen, but still possible ?). Most full nodes reject it, a small portion of miners reject it. So that would be a hard fork because now you have no consensus, you have 2 chains.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:49:57
Because most full nodes and some miners (currently around 25%) would reject BU blocks at 3MB, it not already at 2MB. Which means you have a hard fork because those miners which are not BU would reject BU blocks and still create blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:54:55
So concluding: there could be code which enables SegWit without waiting for 95% for 2 weeks (UASF). It has a potential to create a fork, but the believe is: if it happened it would force the miners to choose between SegWit (maybe less money in the long run with LN) or less transactions to process right then (aka less money in the short run, maybe none at all) and they probably can't block SegWit because that other chain with 25% of the miners will continue mining.
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:21:28


LN is a very complicated solution to the problem, it takes a lot of time to make it. SegWit exists today, I really doubt it is blocking the people working on LN to work on LN.
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:39:01
Well, you would piss off about 75% of all the Bitcoin miners if you did it right now. With altcoins going up, some might not come back.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:53:34
Now that is something we agree on. When a hard for happens, people will need to make a choice. Which should be pretty easy in this case.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:24:26
If you choose to do an accidental fork, that's not much different from a hard-fork is it ?


Not relayed is an other word for: blocked ?
@_date: 2017-03-15 08:40:24
How would you be able to tell the difference ?
It's like saying: a browser is signalling that the user-agent is a Firefox browser on Android. And you are looking at webserver logs. How can you tell it really is Firefox on Android and not just one pretending to be one. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:31:24


Euh, isn't miners check transactions and create blocks, nodes check both blocks and transactions. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 11:38:34
OK, I was just checking.
@_date: 2017-03-15 02:23:21
So far they are happily still mining BU blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:25:43
I don't see BU fans doing anything right now. Other than block adoption of SegWit.
@_date: 2017-03-15 02:21:37
Clearly the miners are not taking your advise.
@_date: 2017-03-15 09:14:17
So basically, a hard fork to SegWit.
So again we'll wait for everyone (currently: most of the full nodes and around 25% or more of the miners) to upgrade to a version which currently does not yet exist. What would a user-activated soft fork look like ? You pick a date and everyone will change a setting by hand ?
An other way, which core could go: lower the SegWit softfork to 60% or something like that.
@_date: 2017-03-15 08:11:15
I don't know, but there are more miners signalling BU support than SegWit support.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:58:23
If one part of the network with the most miners accepts this block and other part of the network which has the minority miners but most full nodes does not you get 2 chains aka a fork.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:52:08


I made it very clear: I was talking about a block which is invalid by SegWit rules. Clearly segwit nodes would not accept such a block.
@_date: 2017-03-15 09:22:35
When you enable SegWit and based on those rules start to drop/block blocks from a majority of miners that's called a hard fork. The question is: which of the rules in the Bitcoin core version which has SegWit would end up blocking blocks when clients start using features. Because I'm pretty certain those exists, why else would you need a soft-fork ?
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:20:24
OK. So a hard-fork it is.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:16:19
Please do a thought experiment like I did for yourself:
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:08:58
Ohh, OK, my mistake.
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:34:43
I was expect miners to connect to the full nodes of the pool. But there would probably be some software as a proxy between them to handle  at least authentication of the miners, collecting per miner statistics and handle distribution of transactions to miners. I guess that's what you'd call the bridging node. The full node would take care of the validation I would expect.
So my point was, the full node ends up creating the transaction list and any other information without the hashes on the input side and maybe even creates the block that is send out of the network.
Sorry for asking/checking fundamentals. :-(
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:17:06
Miners also run full nodes (that is what the pool is).
@_date: 2017-03-15 08:18:35
You believe one guy controls multiple mining pool which together have almost 30% of all Bitcoin mining power ?
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:18:46
I suggest you to look into using an 'altcoin'.
@_date: 2017-03-16 18:41:07
On the miners side, I suspect they might not even be BU fans. They just don't want SegWit. They like getting the transaction fees and don't want Lighting Network with off-chain transactions. Understandable off-chain transactions do not give any incentive to miners at all.
@_date: 2017-03-15 11:21:24
Yeah, I can see that.
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:38:07
Hey, confidence is a scale. I'm probably not as far off from where you stand. It just looks that way if you think I'm all the way on the other side. Maybe I'm just less worried about a Bitcoin fork, because I now see that if a fork of that type happened the miners only have a few ways to go: get less money, join the Bitcoin SegWit nodes or go somewhere else. Now I am surprised at how many miners stayed with Ethereum Classic. So maybe I shouldn't be as confident.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:42:39
Last time I had a discussion like this with someone, they said: miners aren't smart enough / don't feel confident enough to patch the code they are running.
You are saying the opposite. What do you believe ?

Actually, you can't, as I understand it there is no production ready client.
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:46:10
Whatever happens, some turbulence/drama would definitely ensue.
@_date: 2017-03-15 14:24:52
Well, those don't sound that unlikely... because SegWit only has 25% of the hash power of overall (almost 30% for BU, but on the rise faster than SegWit).
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:25:32
But this means: the SegWit code for producing and checking blocks is not being tested.
@_date: 2017-03-15 09:29:54


Yes, that's called a hard fork. No software has been released for this yet. Or a 51% soft fork instead of the current 95% soft fork for that matter.
PS Adoption of SegWit with miners is at about 25% currently, so not even near 51%
@_date: 2019-03-12 10:05:01
Last few times I bought it would always go back down again just after (usually just a little bit, nothing scary). Kind of takes the joy out of it. :-)
@_date: 2017-03-15 01:54:55
The Bitcoin-core software uses a soft-fork for SegWit.
Which means it uses rules to determine if it can automatically enable SegWit. Here at the rules. As far as I know there is no other switch (other than a software upgrade which would add such a thing):
"Lock-in: once 95% of blocks in a 2,016-block long retarget period have signaled that their miners are ready to enforce segwit, segwit will lock-in – meaning that unless the blockchain is rolled back at that point, segwit will become active (see next point).
Activation: 2,016 blocks (about two weeks) after segwit is locked-in, it will activate. That means all full nodes running segwit-aware code will begin requiring miners to enforce the new segwit consensus rules."
I can tell you BU blocks are still being mined and the trend for BU blocks is up, not down. The trend of SegWit is also up, but slower:
For example the current latest block is from AntPool block (they are in the Bitcoin Unlimited camp):
So to answer your question, as I understand it: no, it seems not.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:36:15
The payment processors act as a 3rd parties, I believe it was explained in this presentation:
(I should probably watch it again as well, as a refresher)
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:15:20
I really doubt they stop developing LN because SegWit was blocked.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:44:37
Sorry, my mistake for being unclear: I meant, the full nodes which run the mining pool still check transactions.
But sounds to me like we'll end up: to agree to disagree.
@_date: 2017-03-15 08:50:41
It doesn't matter if BU is adopted or not, what is important to me is that the block size is increased. For that you need BU to be adopted or SegWit needs to be adopted. BU will not be adopted, I agree with that. But let's again look at what you need to get SegWit adopted:
SegWit needs 95% of all miners to support SegWit for more than 2 weeks. Around 25% of all miners are signalling SegWit and almost 30% are signalling BU.
If the BU camp keeps mining the way they do that means SegWit will NOT be adopted. Because SegWit will currently only be automatically adopted with a soft fork if 95% is reached before, I think it was, November 2018.
For as long as those miners keep supporting BU and don't change their mind, they will block SegWit. And if they keep it up until that date SegWit will not automatically be adopted. At all.
As things are now: no blocksize increase happens. At all.
@_date: 2017-03-15 08:56:37
There are 3 options:
- BU gets adopted (it won't. That is clear)
- SegWit get adopted (this is currently blocked by enough 'support' by miners for BU)
- nothing happens (that seems to be what is currently going to happen)
@_date: 2017-03-15 00:55:32
Something I did notice when I look at the blocks: BU miners are still mining their blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-15 09:50:20
Please repeat your thought experiment with the current situation:
- almost all full nodes are running SegWit
- 25% of miners currently support SegWit and about 30% support BU.
Now what will happen if you upgrade all SegWit nodes &amp; miners again and then at some point enable SegWit and enforce the SegWit rules.
I believe that is called a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:20:51
99% ? You'll never get that.
The trend of BU miners is up and the trend of SegWit miners is up, but much slower than BU. So one possibility is to choose a lower limit than the current 95% to enable the soft-fork.
@_date: 2019-03-14 19:57:37
Actually, there is no fractional reserve banking anymore, the rules are much more loose than that.
@_date: 2019-03-19 00:09:48
From what I understand USD is most used, but I think their is a limited supply of it. And prices went up fast.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:27:29
So clearly not one guy, I see 7 pools:
@_date: 2017-03-15 09:35:18
Not really, looks more like a small drop:
BU also had a similar small drop:
Basically, nothing changed.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:20:03
Maybe I'm wrong, but as I understand it: when you run a mining pool, you run one or more full nodes, those would reject just fine.
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:40:30




So a mining pool runs full nodes which at least partially dictate what kind of block you'll get.
@_date: 2017-03-15 02:38:58
OK, but this is a whole group and their firepower is increasing. Not decreasing.
@_date: 2017-03-15 09:06:56


What I'm saying is: BU is blocking SegWit. BU adoption is not their goal anymore. The goal is blocking SegWit adoption.
@_date: 2017-03-15 09:38:44
Nothing will change, unless you can convince the miners that currently show support for SegWit to update to a version which does not soft-fork SegWit, but basically hard fork's it.
@_date: 2017-03-15 09:00:25
Currently the miners control that. You need 95% of all blocks to be mined with signalling SegWit, only about 25% is doing that right now. And almost 30% is signalling BU. BU will not be adopted, but currently SegWit won't be adopted either.
@_date: 2019-03-14 13:40:39
What's new is that the reserve ratio doesn't exist anymore.
Sorry, I'll jump directly to the right point (and when he says UK, US is pretty much the same):

You did not watch the video series (it's 6 short videos, then you'll know how it works), your ideas are pretty much outdated since the 70s or 80s or something.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:21:53
As I understand it: the mining pool runs a full node, those will reject just like a normal full node.
@_date: 2017-03-15 09:08:34


So basically a hard fork.
That is possible. This will mean an other round of upgrading software. And picking some kind of date when to enable it.
Currently around 25% of miners upgraded to SegWit.
@_date: 2019-03-17 00:10:02
Their were more candidates which didn't receive corporate funding in 2018 and seems their will be even more in 2020.
So actually I would say things are improving (even if very slowly).
@_date: 2019-03-19 00:02:07
This is what I heard:
Cash wasn't working before the power outage, to give you some idea: from what I heard buying a roll of toilet paper needs a bigger stack of money than the toilet paper roll itself.
And the power outage pretty much took done everything else.
A large part of the population doesn't even have smartphone. And as I understand it the power outage in some part lasted 7 days ? So good luck charging your smartphone.
But that meant Dash Text was one of the last things still working (it's just SMS text messages similar to m-pesa I guess):
Just providing GSM is fairly lower power usage compared to 3G and 4G data connections so that part of the telephone network was still working (maybe everything did, I haven't checked. I just know SMS kept working all that time).
Does a BTC based service exist ?
An other problem was: lots of point of sale systems didn't work either of course.

@_date: 2017-03-15 08:17:24
I don't know, but there are more miners which are signaling BU support than SegWit support.
@_date: 2019-03-11 06:00:30
Honestly, I think there are roughly 3 reasons people are into Bitcoin and crypto in general:
1. those with ideals, for example: 'end the fed' people, 'this can help the 3rd world', etc.
2. those that like technology in general
3. people who think this just a get rich quick scheme.
4. memes
For example Andreas Antonopoulos is probably in 1 and 2.
I'm in 2., I think maybe people in 1. are right for wanting to do this, but I think we can't predict what impact it will have on the long term. It could still go very wrong.
I'm afraid r/Bitcoin has become mostly 3 people and not much else.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:46:46


There are 7 pools, or do you mean: hard-coded to mine in one of his pools ?
@_date: 2019-03-16 23:47:46
And labor participation is dropping in the US.
More and more people are working more and more hours and are still underemployed.

The BU people are working on it, they want to reach their 75% or at least more than now before even trying such a thing. They are currently at 38.5%.
@_date: 2017-03-15 02:09:35
They are still mining BU-blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-15 09:52:49
This is what we know: SegWit is currently not enabled and enforced on any production blockchain network.
@_date: 2019-03-17 01:50:25
Actually they 'started making profit' but not paying taxes, so I guess they pay it in an other country.

As I mentioned before: in practice there isn't a difference, or is there ?
@_date: 2017-03-15 08:38:08
Well, so far fees are only getting higher. You could wait till Bitcoin solves it's problems.
@_date: 2017-03-15 11:18:04
OK, I see. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:41:03


Remember: only miners create chains.


Semantics don't really matter in practise do they ? Because the results are the same.
There could be multiple reasons which could cause an invalid SegWit block. Here is a less likely example: lots of people on here agree that BU has bugs, could they end up creating a block which is BU compatible and not SegWit compatible ?
Anyway, it could be a year or more before one is created, unless someone wants to force the problem.
Some say governments would love to cause problems with Bitcoin. A perfect opportunity right there for more drama.
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:15:18
Ultimately my goal is, what I want is for the problems with the blocksize to be solved. Which ever way. And I want to know where Bitcoin stands, when it will get solved. And how much drama there will be before it is solved. That is what I'm trying to find out. I'm trying to find out where the problems are, where the boundaries are, what needs to be done, etc. I've not been following Bitcoin (especially SegWit) closely much this past few years, I'm sorry. I knew what they presented about SegWit in 2015.
Here is a question I have: are there any mining pools that don't run a full node to connect to the rest of the network ? If so, is that common ? Because I always thought all mining pools run one or 2 full node to connect to the rest of the network.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:19:07
It's not enabled, the soft-fork hasn't happened yet. The software is on 80% of the nodes and 25% of the miners. The soft-fork only happens when 2 weeks 95% of all miners signal SegWit compatibility.
@_date: 2017-03-15 11:18:44
Ok, but be aware that could lead to a fork if an invalid SegWit block was created before everyone moves to SegWit compatible code.
@_date: 2019-03-19 21:10:55
Here is my take on it based on what I've read online and the people from Venezuela I've been in contact with:
From what I heard the Venezuelain fiat cash wasn't working even before the power outage because of inflation. And limits were in place at ATMs on how much cash people could get out of them. People where trying to use electronic payments but their were problems with that as well. For example because of inflation some payment networks couldn't even handle all the zeros so outages were common. Point Of Sales system had similar problems. Worse the US is now working on blocking use of creditcards as well.
The biggest alternative for payment in shops was USD. So when the power went out the most used became USD cash. From what I understand was that their isn't enough USD cash in the country so prices went up quickly when the power outage happened. Point Of Sales systems also didn't work anymore in most shops of course.
While the Bitcoin network and telecom network were working people need a smartphone to use an app for that or a laptop/PC (last is probably not a likely option at a shop). There are 2 problems with that. Most of the people in Venezuela doesn't have a smartphone but are still stuck on a feature/dump phone. Which means for only a small number of people or even shops could use Bitcoin, but the power outage in a large part of the country lasted 7 days which I assume meant smartphones did not keep working either. Because they use the 3G/4G data connection (or WiFi) which drains a lot of power. My guess is the same applies for the telecom provider side, I don't know if they shut down the 3G/4G data connections.
From what I heard some crypto enthusiasts in the country did develop a crypto solution which did keep working, which is Dash Text because it's a text/SMS message based solution similar to M-Pesa in Africa:
So what other options were actually still working ? In theory barter would have been one, but my guess is that didn't happen either because that is clearly less than ideal in a modern society.
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:38:24
From what I've read the SEC does not need to give a ruling, the default is that it's allowed. So could be they will not say anything. In that case in theory you would have to wait till monday to be certain.
@_date: 2019-03-17 00:28:44
I know things are improving.
Honestly, I was not being very courteous.
Anyway... back to the point: their is a lot of change coming in the job market. UBI isn't trying to fix anything it's just giving people a soft landing when shit hits the fan.

The idea how Yang wants to do it: make sure companies like Amazon actually starts to pay taxes which they are not doing right now. But they are destroying jobs and creating a lot less new jobs in the process.

They will not, but they will also block adoption of SegWit, which means as things are currently: nothing will be fixed.

That's a pretty crazy situation. Does anyone know when he'll have a newer faster or cheaper hardware so their hashing power goes up ? Because almost 30% is pretty bad, but if that keeps increasing... you get the picture.
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:21:17
You'll probably get a fork and loose (as things are currently) 75% of mining power. Which then means the miners will have to decide what they will do, join the people who make the transactions or make less money or go somewhere else.

It would depend on if both parts block each others blocks (thus 2 chains ignoring each other) and what part the people that generate the transactions are on and if they still had miners (because otherwise you can't extend the chain).

That sounds very free indeed.
Maybe I should explain why I looked at inequality, not because I care how rich people are, but it can be an indicator how poor others are or will be. For example in the US the middle class is shrinking, not to mention how the poorest are doing. With people in dire straits death and violence are more likely.

Well, r/bitcoin is 99%: memes and price and memes about price.
Not like Bitcoin is really used that much in real life.
Something like 99.9999999% is all speculation and most of that is on exchanges.
Caring about the Bitcoin price is like looking at US GDP and saying the economy is doing great !
Most of what is counted by GDP ends up being the stock market, etc., just money making more money on the stock exchange. Not actually money flowing into the real economy. The number of new businesses is at a low point. The unemployment numbers look pretty good, but that is just because of many people have left the workforce and they aren't counted (I read something about 50% on disabilities, but it can't be of those that left the workforce that would be a very big number). The jobs people do have are of low quality aka: not long term jobs with benefits, but crappy jobs like Uber driver. Inequality is on the rise and real wages have been stagnating since 2000.
Used to be cryptocurrency and the Occupy movement had something in common.
Bitcoin in less than 10 years has pretty much become what it was against. If I'm not mistaken: Inequality in Bitcoin is even worse than in the regular economy.

If your employer would pay you in Bitcoin wouldn't it be a bad thing if you can't get it directly because of high fees, etc. and you both had to depend on an exchange to handle your transaction ?
That's basically what I'm talking about.

I guess cryptocurrencies mixing services might actually be a pretty good example.

Microsoft can push a silent update to any Windows system, even targeted did you know that ? So why wouldn't Apple be able to create such software ? They already do silent updates for Mac OS X.

My field is computing. I'm into crypto for the technology. I like reading/understand about things like encryption and hashes, etc. how they are used in new and interesting ways.
Some are into crypto for political reasons.
While I think it would be good to have better rules and oversight to govern banks and if all else fails competition could be a good option.
I also believe here in western Europe governments in a lot of cases actually work for the most part and aren't completely corrupted like in the US for example. I life in a society with a working social safety net. So I'm not some anarchist or libertarian who wants to completely take down the government.
I do see the appeal of a government who can't keep printing money to fund wars. The US is the biggest warmongerer around and one of the biggest offenders of it. A big part of the problem is how capitalistic the US is.
Crypto is also very capitalistic in nature, so I hope if crypto wins the race for being money and government money is marginalized we don't end up with a world where we go to far in one direction thus creating new/even worse problems.
Anyway... crypto still very cool technology. :-) Some of which can be applied more broadly in computing.
Some just want to make money, hey I get that. But's a very boring motive to me, someone doing just fine without crypto.
I did put some money into crypto to hopefully boost the pension which will probably won't be very good when I'm of the age when I get it (I don't believe they are doing a very good job, but it does look like the price of basic needs might go down over time).
When I made profit I took out all the money I put into it. So when the price goes down to 0 I will have made no loss, everything above 0 is pure profit for me (at the time of sale).

My guess is you are not an IT security expert (I'm not either, but I do follow the space).
Every recent model of Intel processor and intel mainboard chipset actually does have a management engine. The management engine can be used for good or really, really bad.
Here is an article about DRM:
vPro in the past already was a problem:
The ARM processors also include a "trustzone" they might also be used for good:
Currently, we don't have any control over our Intel devices, 
On most ARM-devices we, as a consumer, don't have control over the ARM trustzone either.
There are hold outs though:
Certain security experts are already complaining how they don't have a 'trusted computing base' anymore.
Because everything includes firmware these days and firmware gets hacked:
Intel CPU has had microcode for many, many years. It's not permanent though. Intel now has this management engine in the mainboard chipset. Intel still can't build something which is secure though, you see this every year at the security conferences.
USB-devices have always had firmware, but exploits have been getting better, look up: badusb
Storage devices like harddisks and Flash-based devices like USB-sticks, SD-cards and SSDs are firmware based:

All flash-based systems have an embedded controller with firmware.
Why ? Because flash is really, really unreliable without it. They are all error correcting. Nobody uses raw flash. The reliability is fully done in software. And because newer models internally work differently from older models and these are sort of trade secrets how they do it. The operating system can't have a driver for it to talk to the raw flash.
If you want to know how it works you should watch video. They explain all the things. If you want to skip some of the technical stuff. Just watch the beginning introduction until it get to technical and than skip to the end where the questions start.
The quick summary of the technical part is: they disassamble the device and part of the software (firmware) and replace it with their own software.

You must be someone that lives in the US. :-)
EDIT: Although I've never tried to do that with my whole paycheck. I would need to use multiple exchanges or sellers for it. I can however transfer smaller amounts from my bank account into BTC in minutes in my country, you'd probably want to monitor it to make sure it gets enough confirmations.
@_date: 2015-04-10 09:08:02
Have you ever seen a shop where you can buy a raw flash device which did not include (updatable) firmware ? Because that is the important part for security.
If you have a flash device which can be used as a raw flash device with UniFS that's great you can do that, but you are probably still talking to a device which has a controller with firmware.
Thus security-wise it doesn't matter how you talk to the device.
The only solution is:
encrypt all your data before you write anything to your storage.
The problem becomes, especially for embedded devices, where do you keep your key ?

The article is a bit more sensationalistic than the answers he gives in the video: 
Peter Todd mentioned a number of problems.
For example fast transactions. He seems very pessimistic that it can be solved.
Darkcoin, euh Dash, has implemented InstantX to do fast transactions which depends on centralizing things a bit. But 2400+ masternodes sounds pretty distributed to me. Not that bad in my mind for a smaller currency.
I think it's great to have these experiments in altcoins.
Even if they might regulate things and they force changes in these currencies the way for cryptocurrency fans to win this war would be if we can still do simple exchanges between cryptocurrencies. Some might be more illegal than others, but if you can easily exchange it they can't stop the users. - probably more important a good decentralized mixing service.
The jury is out on who will win and that jury is going to stay out very many years to come.
Just look at what came before it:
Who won the war between Hollywood, iTunes, Spotify, Netflix, etc. vs. Piratebay, Bittorrent and PopcornTime ? I believe the jury still out on that too.
@_date: 2015-04-16 10:58:08

Actually, virtual currency is a term that applies to many sorts of currencies, not just crypto. Other examples are: currencies in massive multiplayer games which are used for trade. (remember where the name of Mt. Gox came from ?)
Sometimes they can be exchanged for real money.
There is also a country in Asia where you have to report to the government how much game money you have if you have a significant amount. I don't remember the details right now, I just know it's part of these videos:

The router is hardly the problem, most people have NAT, you can't connect in from the Internet to these devices.
What many of these devices do is:
They talk to a 'cloud service' from the manufacturer, if you give these devices a way to connect to the internet at all they are indirectly exposed (some don't work without an internet connection). Bad guys don't talk directly to your device, the break into the cloud service and own all devices. These devices will auto-update.
The other way they will get into one device on your network is: devices that come with WiFi.
What will most people do ? They will have most devices on the same network. Probably the same as their PC which has a browser with a Flash plugin...
Good luck.
@_date: 2015-03-16 10:50:23
Sure, but my guess is. The reason the article called it virtual currencies, is because the law firm meant virtual currencies. Not just crypto currencies.
@_date: 2019-05-01 17:27:52


that's not true, think about that again.
Simple example: hyperinflation.
Most people with a lot of money have a very large part of their money stuck in buildings, businesses, etc. Which means you first have to sell something to be able to use it for something else. A less wealthy person usually has a bigger share of their money in easily spendable bank account, cash, etc.
