Taxation itself is not theft. Democracy technically allows us to indirectly choose people who appoint people who then allocate spending of our taxes (taxation with representation).
The theft is that so many of these people are corrupted, and allocate funds in exchange for bribes, amongst other shady dealings.

One could argue that an ETF will cause the value of bitcoin proper to rise, thus canceling out most of the hit from the reduced premium. Also, a 401K is tax-deferred, and many companies offer a 401K match, so those should be considered as well. I think it all combines into a reasonable scenario.

It's a typo of "hold" so it makes sense that "yodel" is the pronunciation.

Roll it over to an IRA, get GBTC. Sell it just before a true ETF arrives, then get the true ETF.
