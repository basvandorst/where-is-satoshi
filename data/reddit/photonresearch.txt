I have always been inspired by the future that bitcoin represents, and the burgeoning art world and forms of expression that it provides.
After being exposed to a Casascius Gold bar, I knew these bindings with the blockchain could be used as visual medium, relics from a parallel age that is coincidentally fully capable of being reality.
Chasing Casascius is a book about that reality.
I am committed to the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and am working with my printer to create this book in a way that leverages the blockchain and bitcoin service providers to the fullest extent.
There will only be 5,000 copies and we are collecting orders until the bitcoin halving at block 420,000.
A portion of the proceeds will go to bitcoin charities, and although we can donate in private, we are still negotiating with which charities would like to publicly be part of this. We really want to use the ecosystem in it's entirety and set the standard for how bitcoin can be tied to assets and the transparency it provides.
As such, we are *only* accepting orders in bitcoin.
We have been working closely with them for the past several weeks. The sales close at block 420,000, and I will be available to give updates on your orders.

yeah, I really think technology evangelists in different regions of the world could introduce them in that scenario. The main thing being that places separated by real geographic boundaries would have different exchange rates and would need different series of notes to keep up the exchange rate for local goods and services. But across continents at the minimum different notes would already be in circulation.

0.19 btc at time of writing, Coinbase fix at $150, we are working on making that more apparent on the website

Looks closer to European style notes

ah good point, a modification to this scheme is if every single note had funds tied up in a trusted multisig address.

what about those two years where it trended downwards to the $200s

NFC tags are mere flat metallic sheets inside of thin paper material, it is unpowered and the data on it is read by the electrons becoming excited to a powered state by the electromagnetic field of another powered NFC reader like the ones in your phones.
The problem half a decade ago and probably still today was the price of the tags. It would add an overhead cost of 2-3 dollars to each note.
But if governments are purchasing in such big quantities, then there will be competition amongst NFC tag manufacturers to accept lower and lower margins getting the price down.
