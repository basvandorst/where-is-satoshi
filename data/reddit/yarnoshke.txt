I'm pretty sure that coal was burning before the mining even starts. So claiming that it causes more environmental emissions is kinda void.
If it were all solar or other renewable energy it wouldn't be a problem.
I'm pretty sure population growth drives emissions so we just need a good ole fashion genocide or mass disease to cull the demand. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:48:53
Also... would the other locations eventually follow a similar price pattern?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:12:45
Hope so! 
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:55:46
Everytime it goes on sale people mass buy and the price goes stupidly high... Then the fomo people jump in and boost it even higher 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:45:20
Is the price different depending on your location? o.O I dont understand this and I've been reading alot of similar posts.
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:44:21
Ultimately you should have more bitcoin.

last laugh? Ive been laughing all along... even if the bubble bursts I think majority of us still gain more than we invest by atleast 2-3x, if the bubble never crashes we have x10+
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:28:47
You'd think that adopting bitcoin as a global currency and abandoning fiat would mean you transfer significantly more than afew hundred bucks. What is 20-50 bucks when your salary is eventually paid in it?

Past historical bubbles (5)
Note how each bubble had inflated past reasonable valuation.
Bitcoin remains un-evaluated... and seems to be speculated on price alone.
Might be a bubble... but too complex to actually tell.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:24:13
Tfw you missed out so you try to convince peeps to sell so you can buy. I don't intend to sell.. So many others do not intend to sell. Probs just use it now as its more liquid thru services such as CoinJar. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:45:28
Scrappy scrape 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:35:07
Hopefully the bubble never bursts.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:37:54
I'm happy for you. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 23:20:02
I wonder if it's work looking into trading based on the idea it's being manipulated 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:43:34
You can try be one of those guys who expressed how its going to crash eventually and excite sellers.. then when its cheap you buy.
But most bitcoiners are now bred into a generation of long term holders/savers now... so not gonna happen I guess..
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:11:25

Btc skimming

The interesting thing with transferring btc to hedge in CoinJar is I think there is no transfer fee. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:29:06
Also I don't mean to sell all my bitcoins when it's over priced. I was thinking like 3-5%. Still not a good idea? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:33:04
I'll trial it at a low 1-2%  and see how we go. Might post an excel for you guys. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:30:51
Don't listen. Sell to me! 
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:17:19
Guys crypto is only like barely a fraction of the world's derivatives. Once it's like 1% of the world... We rich! To da moon! Hodl
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:27:40
What about the use of a hedge? Like the one in CoinJar? 
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:05:00
Swiss central bank are saying Bitcoin isn't good enough. I don't really think Bitcoin itself is being hacked. It's the exchanges they are stored in are getting hacked.
@_date: 2018-06-22 00:37:03
For me. I bought a 2004 Yamaha FZ6N. No where near a Lambo but its nice.

Is there a video I can watch related to trading? I'd like to give it a go.
@_date: 2018-07-23 03:16:21
Plot twist. The price is inflating because someone made a bunch of fake orders and cancelled them all instantly suggesting mass buy ins. So everyone is buying in.
@_date: 2018-07-25 00:50:33
Im bad at german. First class was last night ��
@_date: 2017-10-14 05:39:13

I was reading somewhere. When ever the price reaches a new high it goes highly inflated.
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:38:52
Pretty sure bip is a fork. Which is a significant event where a concession between 2 choices is made. Likely the way we authenticate transactions. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:17:37
What were other event related factors? 
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:20:47
Your wealth is determined by how much money you spend. Not how much you jew. And you can't spend Jew'd money

@_date: 2017-05-19 15:54:49
Will this result in a decline or increase of value? 
@_date: 2017-05-19 07:52:18
Some people here claim that its not inflated, rather it has reached a new plateau. Hard decisions! But I've decided to take the risk and put abit of moneys
@_date: 2017-05-19 07:53:41
Why do you think that? Its pretty high already do you expect it to go higher? Looks inflated kinda
@_date: 2017-05-22 06:59:57
@_date: 2017-05-19 13:07:08
I keep hearing about people incrementally buying 
@_date: 2017-05-19 08:26:40
Your hand?
@_date: 2017-05-19 06:11:31
I would consider a long-term hold yea
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:21:05
So the price has gone up. Is this directly driven by the sigwit agreement? And what to expect when sigwit is finalized and functional?
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:46:53
Like after 1k it went to 4k. After exceeding 10k it went to 18k. 
What happens if it exceeds 18k? Will it be 30k?
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:23:49
It's saying eth is ok
@_date: 2017-05-28 12:09:17
I agree with this. I also want to fuck manipulation from governments. Primarily China.

I am guessing someone is paying btc in the deep dark web to communities such as Cthulhu to get rid of these people
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:24:46

You can transfer money and buy bitcoin. And also hedge the bitcoin or sell easily. 
They offer easy access to addresses to recieve and easy to send as well. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 01:02:24
Is your order still pending? If so maybe you want it too cheap. Offer slightly more 
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:04:54
Bitcoins will remove banks and thus the interest rates that influence our inflation. No banks means no loans means no further inflated costs based on the current system. However population and limited space will still drive inflation as a function of increased demand and limited supply. We need to basically kill alot of people. Vote yay for genocide. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 03:09:38
Ask Nancy Tranny 
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:12:24
Looked at charts with met cap against price and noticed it's reasonably correlated (ignoring the outlier type peaks from excessive buy/sell) 
Does that mean the more money converted to btc the higher the cap thus higher price? 
Double cap = double price? 
What is the math  expression for the price currently? 
@_date: 2017-06-26 22:48:45
Put some into tenx 
@_date: 2018-12-01 00:19:04
I think we still need this system for awhile. Like... These socialist welfare payments need to come from somewhere.
For now it's no where.
@_date: 2017-06-09 01:03:41
Nancy tranny has a word or two
