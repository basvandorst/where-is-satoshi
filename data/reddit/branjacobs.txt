"want to be coins" is a grammatically corrected version of "wannabe" that feels wrong.

"Deposit" and "withdrawal"

Sort of. I use their pro.coinbase site. It was called GDAX before.
Fees are lower than regular coinbase site and app. Catch is you have to wait for ach bank transfer from checking account.

Same here. $25 a week. I look at price movements like I would a clock on Sunday.

Can't say I have paid too much attention to my deposit limits, I don't get anywhere near them. 
1k a week works out to 50k+ a year, quite a bit of money even for 6 figure income. Be careful, I suspect the market will continue to cool in the short/mid term.

I don't think I've ever typed a crypto address out ever. 
Copy and Paste or QR only, then a quick sanity check on the first and last 5 or so characters. 
I would consider crypto address' and keys as not really human-readable and as such one should avoid 'writing' them manually.

Op couldn't be bothered to scroll through this sub before claiming censorship. 
Op suspects that titles suggesting censorship get more attention.
Either way, down voted.

What trading strategy would involve paying fees?
@_date: 2019-01-16 17:01:50
I would think Coinbase, the 'app', is just a clean, dead simple and up-charged-cuz-convenience front end for Coinbase Pro, to be used by small dollar non-technical folks. 
buy/sell ' order on Coinbase = buy/sell ' order on Coinbase Pro   -   "sucker fee"
I would guess.

It does require a fix for transaction malleability, which segwit does. 
Wouldn't have to be segwit, any fix for transaction malleability would do.
