Absolutely consistent, avg. downtime &lt; hour per year.

Great point, however I don't believe there is any available power at that price. Most of the cheap energy comes from hydro, which has steadily been eaten up by data centers before the bitcoin boom.
Since that time, more than a few bitcoin miners have moved into that area. From talking to utilities in that region, Chelan.. etc.. I'd estimate ~GW of energy is devoted to mining. Capacity at that rate has been saturated.

I grew up in a renewable power company- it is in my blood and it became my passion. I don't know your background but I love seeing people rooting for it and it makes sense to give a damn about the world we share, thanks for being a decent human being.

Yes, I agree with you 100% for a green mining future and yes I am 100% renewable.
Dang, I wish you were investing. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:28:43
Will do.

Wow, the envion whitepaper is incredible and describes exactly why I've been working to power datacenters with green energy and why bitcoin mining needs more affordable renewable energy now- I will continue my research but thanks for the lead. Nice to see a little affirmation from others in this ecosystem, thank you.

Shoot, well ok- 
Welp, see ya later!

I'd imagine sybians are cheaper than ASICS miners. I'll have to "research" erotochines when I'm back home on my personal computer

So I would need to find a bulk supplier of S9's to utilize a MW worth of power which you would be comfortable putting the money up for.
Is that roughly 330 S9's @ about ~$1.7M you would put up?

I'm sorry I'm not understanding your post, specifically the "Good luck though" portion -
Are you saying there is or there is not availability of these miners? 
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:06:44
Interesting! But I do not know of a way to get those in bulk. I am not a current miner either.
Beyond that, while I understand $250k is a lot of money for the private party, in large scale power projects (utility scale) are tens to hundreds of millions of dollars. I would be interested in potentially breaking this down into chunks or tranches, but I was envisioning something in the neighborhood of 1MW+ deals, up to the whole enchilada- Is that a scale you could work at?

Send me a pm with an email/phone number- I may reach out later in the week
@_date: 2018-02-25 22:03:01
Keep your eyes out and I will do the same. A little capital backing is definitely valuable to me. I envision working with some bitcoin experts BUT going into a deal partnering with a novice also appeals to me as we could both learn the bitcoin business together.
I will keep my eyes open but no promises on being able to find bulkminers- I'd imagine you'd have jumped on a deal yourself had you found them already!

You own two mining facilities already and are building an 80MW facility? Wow, that last one is a huge project! How much power are the other facilities? Are these domestic to the US? 
I have had discussions in the past with hyperscale data centers, of which there are only 400 in the world and at 80 megawatts we're talking roughly that scale. I like that.
Did you fund, build, own and now operate these facilities as a single entity? Do you think that would be your role at this 20MW scale or do you envision some kind of 3rd party consulting/brokering to other bitcoin miners or a crowdfunding scheme? I haven't heard of your company before, no offense.

I'm a green energy developer. Fuck coal. 
Power is online and 100% renewable.

Great!
