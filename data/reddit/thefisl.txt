The point, I think, that is trying to make is that possession of coins was given up to gox and the btc protocol doesn't "know" that the possessor is not necessarily the owner.
The point everyone else is trying to make is that it doesn't matter. Consider any hard currency being put in a bank. The us dollar has no way of "knowing" that the possessor shouldn't be able to use the money.  That is to say, if the bank decides to spend your money, the money itself isn't going to stop it.
Another tangential argument I think you ar making is also that there is no regulation keeping box from doing what it did with btc because "that's the point" of btc. True, but, there was an agreement made between the users and the ”bank". Its that agreement that was violated not the btc protocol.

You can always go on the digital street corner with digi-hat in hand.

I think the more appropriate analogy would be native Americans vs settlers... The native Americans doing their thing (Mt box) then the settlers come through and don't give a sit about anything and just start fucking shit up (investors of the big firm variety)... Its not small groups of humans that mess shit up usually. Its the "advanced" civilizations that are too shortsighted to care about the future.

nice. Similar story except I did a wire transfer which means after several days I have yet to actually get any bitcoins. At first when it started plummeting I was like cool I will be able to get more. Then I was like... hrm... this is taking too long and I started getting nervous because I felt like the fall wasn't going to last long (I figured it would stop at 80), it hit ~55 and I am really tripping considering I could purchase for "half" (considering I was going to purchase at 120). Now it's climbing up and I am wondering now if my funds are just in limbo now because of all the shenanigans.
TL;DR Bitcoins = roller coaster of emotions

Like says, the native americans weren't peaceful etc. That wasn't the point. It was more that they lived within their environment and didn't try to extract more from it than necessary. We ALL know that they killed and massacred each other. If you think about it like a company, business... etc.... they do that to each other. The difference is that they weren't going about ruining the land upon which they lived. The system that they survived in. That's what I am talking about. 
MT.GOX is doing what they can to make this system happen. They are the most prolific company for this sort of thing. I am not saying they don't have their faults, their issues, etc. But to blame the burden of the system on them is ridiculous. To say that it's their fault they can't handle the load, is naive. They are trying to do their thing and they are getting slammed with requests. If they decline requests, they are shitty, if they accept and can't handle their requests, they are shitty. Its as real a catch 22 as you can get.

Well I just moved up 40 spots in like 10 minutes. My feet are tired from running through this line. 40 down, 27 THOUSAND left!
My fault though, I should have submitted for verification a long time ago. Probably when things were moving along steadily... eh.

You do understand the currency is in its infancy right? Also, you could have similar problems with regular currencies if you decided to"invest" in them at the wrong time.... btc is meant for the digital realm, as far as I know the complications in getting hold of digital money isn't too far off from the way you would do it in the real world (credit card apps and approvals, setting up bank accounts etc) Just, you know... digitally.
Also, scammers and the like exist everywhere...but you're right whoever heard of banks and such folding? 
Edit.. came off kinda shitty and reading your other responses puts your statement in a different light. The point of the"success" for me is the fact that the internet's created something that is traditionally only done by governments... full fledged countries and the like... showing that the internet is in itself a realm of sorts... a little drunk right now so if nonsense... Sorry. :)

They should really consider a shorter name...

Gox is the best exchange. Not to be confused with "a great" exchange, just out of the bunch of exchanges and their offerings, it holds up as the best. This needs to change though.
