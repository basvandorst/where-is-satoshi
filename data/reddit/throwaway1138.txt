Ya I realized that after the first few posts last night.  Not only that but these ppl replying might be sitting on 99% of their coins and report the 1% they have spent.  
My point in all this is that if the vast majority of coins are being hoarded or flipped then the product isn't doing what it is supposed to be doing - acting like a currency.  The dramatic price swings are counterproductive for a currency and encourage "investment" and speculation which is the opposite of what a good currency should be.  So if it isn't a good currency and it isn't a good investment I'm not really sure what it is...besides an interesting concept...

I don't have any coins, I was speaking hypothetically.  If I bought a stock that went from a dollar to a thousand dollars a share I would do the same to diversify so I'm not so heavily vested in one security.
Suppose you have 20 bitcoins right now to your name.  That's worth roughly $20k now at current market price.  If you didn't have those coins and someone handed you $20,000 cash would you go and buy 20 bitcoins at $1000 each?  Just curious.

Aye, therein lies the problem.  A constantly *deflating* currency is as much a problem as a hyper*inflating* currency.

That's actually a pretty good point.  I guess I would cash out around now to lock in gigantic gains.  Why stay in when there's a good chance it plummets back to zero?

I said I was a more traditional investor, not conservative.  I take as much risk as I can relative to my age, job security, financial goals, and ability to stomach it without making bad decisions.  I have a good job with tons of opportunity for growth and a long time span before retirement so most of my money is in stocks.  My stock allocation is a mix of domestic and foreign/emerging markets with a moderate tilt towards small caps.  A relatively small allocation of my portfolio is in bonds split between government securities, corporate debt, and inflation protected bonds (tips).  So it's basically a well diversified long term portfolio that I can stick with for the rest of my life that should do quite well all things considered.  I take neither too much risk nor too little.
I think stocks and bonds are less of a gamble and more of an investment because businesses and debt instruments actually create value as opposed to simply being valuable.  Businesses expand, create new technology, get more efficient, and produce goods and services that society values.  I'm not big on currency or commodities because they are what they are and will never be greater than that.  The prices may fluctuate but a lump of gold will always be a lump of gold and the only way to make money off it is the find a "greater fool" who will pay more for it than I did.

Not if the price of bitcoin drops back to 100 and all you have are lots you bought at 1000.  The point is that currency isn't supposed to be extremely volatile in either direction.  Hyperinflation is bad because it strongly discourages any saving of cash and the rapid "growth" of bitcoin is bad because it strongly discourages any spending.  
As for using bitcoin to invest, grow your money, and buy more goods and services in the future: be careful of outing your wealth into a volatile asset with the intention of using it for short term goals.  That warning applies to anything be it good, stocks, real estate, or bitcoin.  There's no such thing as a free lunch and if you aren't careful you may find yourself in the red with no recourse.

Not if the price is artificially high from speculation.  Everyone and their brother knows about bitcoins skyrocket trajectory so the price could very well be peaking as everyone gets in on it.  I can't say for sure whether it will be worth $100 next month or $10,000 but the point is currency shouldn't be this volatile. 
If your coins are worth ten grand each next month good for you, go buy your car, but beware because the price could just as easily be $100.

That's precisely it...a currency's value should be stable over time, ideally with a bit of inflation to encourage spending and discourage hoarding.  Bitcoin appears to be the opposite: you'd have to be crazy to spend it because it might be worth $2000 tomorrow.
