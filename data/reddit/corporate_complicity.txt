Your argument is analogous to asking: how many times have horses failed us?  What's this new automobile thing and what can it do better?  Sure... paper money can be counterfeited, printed out of thin air (no guaranteed scarcity), its impossible to send over the Internet without a trusted third party, etc.  But you have a good point... horses are produced naturally and no one needs to travel over 25 MPH.  Let's stick with transacting with pieces of paper.

Guys, fuck the price and look at [this]( chart.  Transactions per day are near the ATH of 93k (which happened back around Thanksgiving last year when the price was going nuts).  We are now consistently hitting 60k+ trans. per day!  People are obviously using Bitcoin more and more each day.  An expanding user-base is one of the best ways to increase liquidity on exchanges and stabilize the price.  We stabilize the price, we get more users... People start realizing Bitcoin is a tried and tested protocol that isn't going out with a whimper.

That's some scary, authoritarian shit but I wouldn't put it past the US government to duplicate Bitcoin as their own "Digi-Dollar."  This would create an ecosystem even **further** locked down than the current banking+credit+government corroboration currently strewn together.

I'm with ya, but this guy really does deserve to see some pitchforks.  Gox has failed the community repeatedly (and had many opportunities to get their shit together).
@_date: 2014-03-06 02:21:49
The solution to this is more exchanges.  Gox sucked up way more market share than they deserved.  If Gox users splinter to other exchanges (or say "fuck it" and leave Bitcoin) there will never be another opportunity for a thief to steal **5% of all existing coins**.  850K BTC will never be in a single entity's possession ever again.  The thief is going to have a hard time spending the vast majority of those coins (while simultaneously remaining alive).  Next, regulations need to catch up so their is less "uncharted territory" when it comes to starting an exchange.  Banks are very apprehensive to do business with exchanges in the US.  Also, a community-supported, open-source trading software could help streamline and harden some of the issues exchanges deal with independently while also increasing transparency to those trading.
**tl;dr:  Less barriers to entry for exchanges =**

Of course your money won't physically disappear, but its ~~value~~ *purchasing power* will continually diminish as the currency is debased.  If someone put $100 in a safe place in 1912 (and went to spend it in 2012), they would need an **additional $2,240** to have the same *spending power* their $100 had in 1912.

If you think our broke government can actively investigate even a tiny percent of transactions, you need to tone down the tinfoil. Users can (and do) drastically increase their anonymity by laundering through actively traded alt-coins, using a new address for each transaction, only sending transactions through Tor, using Blockchain.info's new "shared send" function, only converting for cash, residing in a non-NATO country, etc. These practices lead to more of a "surveillance nightmare," for those seeking to draw any prosecutable conclusions from blockchain data.

Its obviously hit or miss, but you can always check [LocalBitcoins](  You might just find someone willing to sell you BTC in person for a fair price.

@_date: 2013-12-18 21:00:15
LocalBitcoins does not **need** to be competitive with exchanges.  However, the higher their margin is and the lower their feedback rating, the less business they will receive.  The two methods of obtaining bitcoin are competing with one another.  The consumer is provided with varying options at different prices and they vote with their money.  Free-market capitalism sometimes works.

A lot of people complain how hard it is but its not any harder than making any other sort of money transfer with an online server (such as funding a brokerage or paying bills online).  You choose a trusted exchange (such as Bitstamp, Camp BX, or Coinbase) and fund your account with your checking account by giving them 2 numbers (routing and account number).  I have been buying and selling Bitcoins for the past 2 years and have not had a single issue.  Its already easy to exchange fiat for BTC (and BTC to fiat) and is getting continually easier.

Don't think of &gt;$1,000 as being too high to jump in.  Just buy as soon as possible.  There's always a possibility for a crash, but Bitcoin has more of a tendency to go the other way.

Fortunately, you will have deniability if any of your spent or sold coins end up being used for illegal purposes.  Just as you can receive bitcoins from any stranger that sees your address, you can also send Bitcoins to any addresses you find graffiti-ed on a wall, in print media, or on the Internet.  The amount of coin movement on the network is immense with over 200k BTC hopping between addresses daily and well over 1 transaction per second.  Authorities can only see what the rest of us see: the purest form of crypto-anarchy. Complete freedom to move units of account anywhere, instantly with no intermediary to ever intervene in a transaction.  The point I'm trying to make is that even if you sell someone $100 worth of BTC with reasonable suspicion they will immediately exchange it on the dark web for a quarter of dank (even though you are not liable for what happens to your coins after you sell them) the chance of authorities knocking on your door is about 0.000053% (8 users busted / total SR 1.0 users).  There's a 90% chance a piece of fiat in my wallet has cocaine on it and that doesn't keep me up at night.  Neither should selling your BTC locally or online.

It does not necessarily dispense anything physical.  If you are trading local currency for BTC, you **insert** your cash and scan your QR code (where you want the BTC sent).  Perhaps a receipt will print with information regarding the transfer (transaction id, amount exchanged, time of transaction, etc.).  Some ATMs also allow you to convert BTC to your local currency.  This would require you to send the machine BTC from your device, prove you made the transfer, then the ATM would dispense cash **to** you.
