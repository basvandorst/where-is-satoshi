This is so cool!  Thanks for doing this!
I got the 0.001 BTC for the answer "What is Rosebud?"
It's simply amazing what you can do with Bitcoin.  Excellent write up too!

Ok, thanks.  I overlooked that the 2 NMS was also there.
So we could now assume that Jenny is the issue.  She won't be able to scam John, but she can cause his 2 NMS to be destroyed.  This would cost her 0.1 NMS to acomplish, so there's a penalty for her to "grief" the system in this way.
In the end I see one of three ways abuse would be attempted:
1) **[John claims he did not receive $200 but actually did.  John declines.]**
John = +$200, -2.1 NMS
Jenny = -0.1 NMS
2) **[Jenny claims to have sent $200, but actually did not.  John declines.]**
John = -2.1 NMS
Jenny = -0.1 NMS
3) **[Jenny claims to have sent $200, but actually sent $100.  John either accepts or declines.]**
This is a mutual destruction scenario in which some interesting game theory may end up coming into play.
3a) **John declines (mutual destruction)**
John = +$100, -2.1 NMS
Jenny = -$100, -0.1 NMS
3b) **John accepts (John realizes that either way he will lose 2 NMS but this will save him the collateral 0.1 NMS)**
John = +$100, -2 NMS
Jenny = -$100, +2 NMS

Yea, it definitely sounds like an interesting protocol.
In my post above, I didn't mean to imply that it wasn't secure.  Rather that it is mutually destructive at best to attempt to violate the trade agreement.
The biggest concern I have is that in scenario 3, Jenny can essentially pay John much less than their agreed price, but John will still have an incentive to accept his loss.  This should result in Jenny being able to receive cheaper coins simply by threatening mutual destruction.
Basically, the 5% figure seems too arbitrary for me which may cause one party to have an advantage over the other.  (Why not 1% or 99%?)
This seems like a very interesting concept though and I will enjoy seeing how this plays out.

I tried... it's too hard!  XD

Haha, thanks again for the hint.  I must have tried at least 20 different spellings of Casascius coins.

This looks very fancy, but I just took a look at their "decentralized exchange" in the paper since I was highly skeptical.  If they keep it the way it is, this will be a catastrophe of fraud.
Collateral is taken from two parties who are trading.  Person A gives a bank account number and deposits their cryptocurrency into the exchange.  Person B deposits fiat into person As bank account and then A marks the transaction complete.
So what's the huge problem?  There's absolutely no incentive to verify the deposit was made into the bank account.
To abuse this system person A simply doesn't mark the payment as complete and can steal the fiat.  Am I missing something here or is this not well thought out at all.
Edit: Person A risks a collateral of 5% of the trade quantity from his own cryptocurrency.  Any collateral less than 100% gives incentive to scam the other party.

Maybe I am misunderstanding it then.
The collateral is 5%.  Using the example in the paper:






Doesn't this mean that John can simply deny ever receiving $200 in his bank account and take the 0.1 NMS collateral penalty for a huge profit?
If the market value is truly $100 per NMS, then with such a small amount of collateral, he has a huge incentive to scam Jenny.

Thanks.  Can you say if the blanks all lowercase?
