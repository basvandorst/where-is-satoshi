Appreciate the input guys. I agree with all. Very few, especially those most deeply involved on the coding side, understand the true implications socially, politically, economically, of blockchain technology and its associated coins/tokens. They seem to know so much about so little. However, this is the nature of the beast and one reason why I thought the opening article befitting the start of what I intend to be an authentically fruitful dialogue. Will be posting more of what I think you will find to be continuing quality fodder for thought as regards this and related issues. For instance, after 40+ years of in-depth research across many domains, I have found what I believe to be a handful of meta-trends that represent the proverbial drivers going forward; e.g., we have spent generations now rewarding the creation of specialists in all areas of knowledge and fields of inquiry. This has led to eras we tag with descriptors like “Industrial Age”, “Information “Age” and so on and so on. The reality of it is, we have and continue to upload mans’ collective knowledge, wisdom, technology, etc., etc. Today, we are in an era where the ability of hundreds of thousands of scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs from all over the planet can collaborate on single issues to solve extraordinarily complex problems with simple, elegant and effective solutions. What is at a premium now is the generalist that knows a little bit about a lot of things that can formulate the better question that teases out the better answer that the specialist, with their too-narrow an understanding of how things work in the real world don’t even know they have.
