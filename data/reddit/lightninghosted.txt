LightningHosted.com is doing something like this. Give it a try.

Seriously, Hopefully with lightning becoming more prevalent someone will spin up another version in a year or so.

They is me. Yes instead of a traditional Captcha lightninghosted uses a small lightning payment (currently 250 sats) to deter spam. When your image reaches 100 views the sats are automatically credited back to you. You can read about it on our about us page [here.](

Offer to give away money on the internet and the internet gives you money.  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯  thanks! I'll add it to the prize pool.

The sats go to whoever has the most views on an uploaded image by 11/14. If anyone wants to participate and doesn't have a lighting wallet to upload an image post your invoice and i'll pay it.

Nah technically its a taxable event every time a US citizen spend bitcoin. It's a huge pain. Personally I think it should be handled like a US citizen buying something with yen or euros.

Do they really have positive or even neutral coverage of bitcoin? Or is this just some Bitcoiner stretching the truth to make China's blockchain push include bitcoin?

Dude is falling down the Bitcoin rabbit hole on live tv. What a time to be alive.

Everyone thinks a block chain can solve everything now days.

The lightning network is made up of a series of channels. You can think of these channels as tubes you could roll a marble through. To pay someone you roll a marble through the tube. Right now all the marbles are on your side of the tube. To move some to the other side you need to spend pay someone. Then there will be marbles on the other side of the channel that someone could roll back to you to pay you. 
This is hugely simplified of course and please keep in mind that there are efforts being made to automate these strange requirements of the lightning network so that users won't need to know any of this in the future.

I think Cash app can do  this in the US. I'd love other suggestions as well because cash app doesn't work for me.

The Vegeta one was something Samson Mow of Blockstream did. No idea about this one.
@_date: 2019-06-13 00:18:49
Exactly and Bcaah is the real Bitcoin ;p

Can you imagine? 70% of the world would hate bitcoin in an instant.
@_date: 2019-09-12 05:11:24
Now there are two of them?

Sorry to ruin a pretty good joke but this actually isn't a flash drive. It's a highly specialized bitcoin wallet called an Opendime.
@_date: 2019-05-03 03:53:36
eh not very i'll spend a bit as a little treat to my self but never tempted to sell bitcoin for dollars.
@_date: 2019-05-03 12:17:47
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-05-03 11:22:27
Wish we could take credit this has been kicking around for years not sure who created it.
