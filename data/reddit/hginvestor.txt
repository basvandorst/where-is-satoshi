If you are unfamiliar with a Bid/Ask spread, then it seems like an over charge, however it’s how markets work. You sell at the Bid and pay at the Ask, they can be close in price or further apart depending on a number of factors including what you’re trading.

If you want to buy a house, a boat, an engagement ring, use bitcoin (main net), both parties have the time to wait for confirmation.
If you want to buy a coffee, burger or some groceries, use Lightning Network (Bitcoin’s second layer), so you don’t have to wait a long time for confirmations.

If you have ever seen the movie the Princess Bride, you will realize that “The Dread Pirate Roberts”, the handle the owner of Silk Road, was a name used by different people at different times being passed from one “pirate” to the next once they had achieved wealth.

@_date: 2019-11-02 07:59:00
Download a Lightning wallet, like Blue Wallet or similar. Then send some Bitcoin to it. Then in that wallet transfer some of your Bitcoin from the Bitcoin main net wallet to the Lightning Wallet (both within the same app). After that confirmation you’re good to spend on the Lightning Network. Some wallets will ask you to connect to a node, usually optional, and some will defer to their nodes. Best of luck!

@_date: 2019-08-31 14:57:06
Lightning is in Alpha, it’s not even in Beta yet. The Lightning Network will fix both fees and speed. Things take time, you can’t just snap your fingers and have complex code written. I work on Lightning and so do tons of others. By the time Lightning is ready for Prime Time (mass adoption) all the bugs will be worked out.

This comparison ignores the Lightning Network and it also argues that it is more secure which is not true. Bitcoin has the largest network and is the most secure. Most of these coins would have the same scaling issues as Bitcoin if they had the same amount of transactions and user base. This was written by a Digibyte shill who is intentionally misinterpreting the information to confuse noobs and non technical people for their own gain. Beware and do your own research.

@_date: 2019-06-13 19:13:52
I always use 1 Sat/Byte and it always goes through just takes time. You only have to pay higher fees if you want the transactions to be cleared fast. The Lightning Network, which is meant for smaller day to day transactions, is fast and also has low fees. You’re spreading uninformed information.

Use Bitcoin to buy house, car, wedding ring, vacation etc. 
Use Lightning Network to buy coffee, groceries, movie tickets etc.
Bitcoin has higher fees than Lightning and takes longer to confirm. With larger purchases it makes sense to use the Bitcoin blockchain. Lightning is instant and has lower fees, and is later confirmed to the Bitcoin blockchain when the channel is closed.

We used gold for 5000 years with no issues. Recessions are cyclical, regardless of Deflationary/Inflationary currency. It’s a Human nature problem. They sold us fiat so they could tax us with inflation and make it easier to pay back their government debts, under the guise that it was good for the economy and would stop recessions. Even after switching to a Keynesian economy in the US we still get recessions( and even had a Great Recession)about every 10 to 20 years. In fact we had one just two years after dropping the Bretton Woods Gold Standard 1971 (don’t get me started on Bretton Woods vs Real gold standard). Then again in the early 90’s and again with the Housing Crisis in 2007/8. And we’ll have another one in the mid 2020’s regardless of what currency we use (look at historical data). So a Bitcoin economy would be good, because at least people wouldn’t be constantly loosing value on their hard earned money.

Don’t worry about it, I send low fee transactions (1 Sat/Byte) all the time. The longest it’s ever taken was 48 hours and that was during the craziest of times. Worst case if you need it confirmed faster you can do a child pays for parent, but I personally would just wait.
