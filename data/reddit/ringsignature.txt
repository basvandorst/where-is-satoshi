what does that even mean? I'm a liar because I'm thinking about jumping ship on bitcoin? These insane conflicts of interest that are dragging us into the quagmire make me seriously consider it.
@_date: 2015-12-14 21:14:41
wow, unreal.... I'm thinking about jumping ship from bitcoin. This is just too much.
@_date: 2015-12-14 23:10:28
I said I'm thinking about it. Do you know how to read?
@_date: 2016-01-12 04:05:26
I find it hard to believe a person with 500 bitcoins could be so uneducated about bitcoin in general.
@_date: 2016-01-14 02:16:07
Im 36 and think its great. Dont be a condescending douche.
@_date: 2016-01-14 02:00:36
Seems like a valid meme to me.
@_date: 2016-01-14 03:15:32
I dont hope fiat becomes worthless. I also dont think its funny. It makes a good point.
@_date: 2016-01-13 04:36:52
You are the most reviled character in the world of Bitcoin. How does that feel?
@_date: 2015-08-19 20:04:28
That's some brilliant analysis.

shit man had I known playing poker would have enabled me to read minds across the internet I would have started long ago.
@_date: 2015-08-14 20:18:13
Thats disappointing.
@_date: 2015-08-19 02:12:19

Teach me this special skill that enables you to see into MOST of the 80%'s heads to determine them not understanding the importance of the debate. Thats an amazing skill.
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:26:57
you sound like a moron my friend. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:34:03
youre filled with way too much angst. step away from the computer screen and take a deep breath.

wtf is peernova?
@_date: 2015-08-19 03:09:50
It was more than a few downvotes.
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:32:13
Its stupid to despise people because they disagree with you. Im well educated on the debate and am in favor of the block size being raised. So bugger off.
@_date: 2015-08-19 02:16:11
Enemy number one is blockstream. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 16:19:28
a few questions? you mean 17 questions?
@_date: 2015-08-19 03:05:53
I agree
@_date: 2015-08-11 22:26:35
You did it to yourself. English is either your second language or you are extremely uneducated.
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:47:47
The way you write makes you sound extremely young. I never claimed to be smarter than you. I have my opinion you have yours, but you sound like a dumbasss when you assume people that disagree with you dont understand the debate.
@_date: 2015-08-11 22:23:29
How old are you man?  Stating things in absolutes makes you sound moronic. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 03:01:54

@_date: 2015-10-19 15:44:00
his point seems crystal clear.
