Theoretically, if you represented all the VISA transactions with bitcoin's transaction format, it would take several terabytes to store years worth of transactions. You would need fiber access to hold full node.
That may seem unreasonable but if you increase the blocksize slowly and keep the transactions flowing, the participating people will be able to purchase fiber access and keep holding full node wallets as well.
Terabyte drives for that purpose only may seem unreasonable as well, but the prices are coming down as well. If you decide to gradually increase the throughput, then the communities operating with bitcoin will be able to afford larger node requirements.
Also you could probably decrease the difficulty adjustments a bit, and require that there are at least 10 blocks above the transaction before you consider it verified. This would "pipeline" the verification of transactions, as it becomes increasingly difficult to erase a transaction that is deeper in the chain.
If we decrease difficulty, then at some point deeper in the chain we have spent the same amount of effort to secure the transaction as before. The chain grows just massively faster.
A public, immutable, fair, widely replicated ledger is one of the nice things in bitcoin. It could make transparent accounting much more transparent in many non-profit organizations, or even in countries.
Update: Another idea that came to mind is that you could try reorder transactions in each block and run zlib on them, that way you might be able to fill up more transactions into a single block.
