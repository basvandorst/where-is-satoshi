So, with the way Electrum sets up SegWit wallets, most mining pools and exchanges **don't yet recognize** those addresses. This is because Electrum uses "full-SegWit" bech32 implementation.   
To work around this, you can create the more "backwards-compatible" BIP49 implementation of a SegWit wallet via Ian Coleman's website then import into Electrum.
Here's a step-by-step.
**Note: Please take all available security precautions when generating your seed--VPN, https, firewalls, etc.**
1. [Go to this site]( 
2. Click "BIP49 derivation path" and generate. Those fifteen words are your wallet seed.
3. In Electrum, File--&gt;New/Restore--&gt;Standard wallet and click "Next"
4. Select "I already have a seed" and click "Next"
5. Click "Options" box and check "BIP39" Seed then click OK
6. input fifteen words from Ian Coleman's site and click "Next"
7. On the "Derivation" screen, replace **m/44'/0'/0'** with **m/49'/0'/0'** and click "Next"
8. If you want wallet key encryption (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED) enter a strong password and store it somewhere safe, then click "Next"
9. Look at your wallet's addresses: they should all begin with "3" (if they don't, start over with a new seed).
10. Enjoy your new SegWit backwards-compatible P2SH-P2PKH wallet.

Not particularly. In my opinion, deviations from "one person, one vote" generally are lacking in humanity.
How much one is taxed ideally ought to be a function of how much one has benefited from the legislative framework of that fiscal year--a framework upon which one's earnings and wealth have flourished or withered. This has been a vexing problem to solve throughout history. However, good approximations have led to enduring societies and happier people.
If a society is born under the mantra "all men are created equal," and later provides universal suffrage for its people, when it becomes time to elect new officials such a society ought to hold each citizen's voice in equal regard.

Yes, in fact. The downside is that your BIP49 SegWit transactions are about 10% larger than bech32 "native" SegWit addresses. This adds a little onto the tx fee, but it is still much lower than the fees on "regular" BTC addresses.

When politically difficult agreements--like the NYA--are made in good faith, it is critical that the parties to that agreement honor it. Otherwise, you get fragmentation and balkanization. Compromise is how shit gets done, even in these extraordinarily polarized times.
Furthermore, backing out of BIP91 and NYA by not activating 2x would mean that any further bitcoin agreements could rarely, if ever, be trusted. Losing that trust is disastrous, because cryptocurrency is largely built on trust.

Extreme deflation gives an economy a completely different set of problems as extreme inflation, but to put it bluntly, extreme deflation can be nearly as bad if not worse. Mild inflation and deflation is generally a good thing, because wages, prices and lending are predictable enough to keep people employed, shopping and willing to take out loans. 
Extreme deflation, in an economic sense, means that work comes grinding to a halt, shopping grinds to a halt and loans come grinding to a halt. Everyone expects their money to be worth more tomorrow, so they hoard it and don't actually use it for anything. In the meantime, unemployment and poverty (in real terms) skyrockets as real economic output plummets.
I love that my bitcoin is increasing in value so sharply, but if the world switches to Bitcoin as a primary currency in the not-so-distant future, I would prefer my Bitcoin purchase roughly the same amount this year as next year. Why? Because I'd rather have a world where people are generally happy and performing meaningful work, being paid in a much-more-stable-by-then form of Bitcoin, than a world in which bitcoin holders are contributing to a deflationary spiral and a decline in real economic output as they hoard their new primary currency. There's enough misery in the world as it stands, and any global system of economics and payment like Bitcoin must prove that it can reduce global misery and poverty before making any significant progress as a global currency.
Fortunately, in many ways, Bitcoin is doing just this. The one thing that made me rethink Bitcoin in the past year has been its brilliant use as a form of remittance for the world's immigrant workforce. Bitcoin, in a very real way, helps working people send more money home to their families than if they had used a bank or other foreign exchange service to change the local currency for their home country's currency at exploitative rates. 
At any rate, I will celebrate the day that people with far more expertise in economics than myself, while obtaining both the authority and the mandate of the democratic process, are able to succeed in bringing about a massive restructuring of economies around a stable and secure Bitcoin.

The 2008 financial crisis inspired both bitcoin and a propensity towards saving money for people born in the U.S. during the 1980s and 1990s. Stagflation in the 1970s encouraged a "spend money before it's worthless" mentality for people born in the U.S. during the 1950s and 1960s. 
As much as I don't want to say it, both types of approach towards money were appropriate given the respective economic conditions of the age. 
With that said, I think saving and working hard is a better approach, and it might be the better mentality for the planet's environmental health.

First, check your old e-mails. Search for a BitCoin address, website login and maybe your password. 
Second, searching "greenwallet" on android app store turns up nothing but greenaddress.it wallets. Their github also has greenwallet written in their code. I think maybe they changed names. 
Third, contact GreenAddress.it customer support and ask about your old coins--if requested, give e-mail and login ID.
I'm not sure you can access your bitcoin via blockchain without your private keys. If you recover your coins, I would suggest transferring them to a [hardware wallet]( a [paper wallet]( or an exchange like GDAX to turn into fiat immediately.

You're completely ignoring three consecutive years of Pulitzer Prizes for national reporting in 2015, 2016, 2017...
You're also assuming that new ownership of a media outlet completely shatters its integrity and commitment to journalism. 
One instance of a journalist using outdated information about bitcoin doesn't discredit the entire publication, nor does new ownership.
On matters of internet culture and recent developments in technology, you likely won't get the best info from WaPo. But to say it's the "least credible" of major publications demands far more evidence than its coverage of pewdiepie and bitcoin fraud.
