how much bitcoin do you have and how much do you plan to buy?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:23:46
I'm also interested in this.
I know it's a bubble, but not sure how to bet against it.

just a pump and dump on a unregulated market

It will crash at some point...
Everyone says HODL because they want it to grow so they get out before it burts. If everyone sells then it's over, so they tell you to HODL.

Sounds good but nobody understands what it means.
I love you guys.

nope, if you format and then check the data maybe... but if you use it for years then the data was overwritten and it's gone.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:47:36
Because it takes a scam artist to see a scam...

yea i'm also asking for a friend... how do i sell?
@_date: 2013-11-11 10:34:09
There is one thing to like it. is more like...
  "Hey guys bitcoin is going to work, right?" 
 "You bet'ya" 
  "Ofc" 
  "i just bought 10 more btc i suggest you buy more"  
 "i bought 200 too" 
  "Ok guys i'm buying more tomorow"
  
... so a circlejerk.
in fact is similar to but investing knows that you should not take tips blindly from investing while bitcoin is just a simple circlejerk where everyone agrees to bitcoin is awesome and everyone who sais anything else is out of the tree club house.
I hope you understand my point of view mister i-write-with-**bold**-and-*italics*-to-make-me-sound-smart.
Circlejerk definitions that apply perfectly to * "people who get together for a debate but usually end up agreeing with each other's viewpoints to the point of redundancy"
* "Sometimes used to describe an internet forum thread where forum members all give each other kudos (Or rep where a rep system is present) for some non-event that has occurred."
* "A group discussion or activity between like-minded individuals that validates mutual biases or goals in a non-confrontational environment."

This entire subreddit is a circlejerk for bitcoin. That's all it is...
@_date: 2013-06-18 08:55:43
Why would you use paypal... paypal is the worst.
@_date: 2013-07-13 09:06:19
This is getting more and more like a religion. It's about money. And you are trying to get people to accept Bitcoin.
