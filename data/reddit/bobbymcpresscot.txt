I mean he could have done better, he didn't invest in tech companies like facebook because he didn't understand it. Apply this to a lot of tech industries he probably ignored because he didnt understand tech he could probably be a lot richer, not that the dude would ever need to.

There is some dude who accidently locked i think what is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoin in some wallet that he has no way of accessing. It just sits there, taunting everyone,

Even pocket lint has value as kindling.

Even if you did, you honestly think you would still be holding onto those 10 dollar coins today? You would have either sold at 50, or sold immediately after the first crash, or the second, or the 3rd, or the 4th. I would love to know how many people bought them at 5 or mined them themselves back then and intentionally kept them this long. Id be willing to bet the number is very small.

I mean if i was investing all my money into bitcoin I'd be looking at any possible way to not have to throw myself off a building.
Bigger players join the fray the higher the price of bitcoin goes, more people that join the more recgonized it might be as a currency. None of which will give it any semblance of stability, because the coin has no physical value and the worth changes by the hour.

It is tax deductible though, and right now that's probably a lot more valuable than a shillcoin.
