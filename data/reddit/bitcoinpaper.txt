Thanks for the fast response, and I really appreciate the time taken for you to type out the response, and the infographic helped to expand my knowledge on how hash values are generated. I have a further two questions (as well as a new query) and comments in response to this reply.
- How is the Bitcoin economy "resilient"?
- Do you know of any major bugs which have been stomped out of the main client?
- Where did the premise of a mining pool come to fruition? I think this would be a great point to write about, seeing as some pools have a combined hash power which is a percentage of the overall hashing power of the entire network.
For the point about the 51% attack, the chance on that happening after doing some further reading is that it would take a serious amount of cash (and some unknown, extreme hatred of Bitcoin) in order to amass the hashing power required to bring the network down.
I know that ASIC miners have been on the cards for quite a while now, but all I've heard about them is that the companies seem to be working in secret, and I haven't personally heard of any which have been spotted in the wild.
The whole open-source and transparency features on Bitcoin are what inspired me to write a paper on this, as (in my opinion) it's truly remarkable how a group of individuals can work together to shape a developing economy, and using it to trust each other and pay for goods. Probably the most well known example of this is the person who paid 10000 BTC for about $25 worth of pizza, which looking at today's charts and figures, is a very large amount, but could have been a risk given the uncertain future and unknown adoption rates of the currency by general end-users.
For anyone who doesn't know about that particular transaction, here's the link to the thread on the Bitcointalk forum:
