**Your transaction will do one of two things**: 1. It will eventually go through or 2. It will eventually time out in the network and full balance will reappear to sending address.
How do I know this? I've sent many low fee transactions that got stuck for weeks as well. Usually they'll be stuck for a week or two then randomly on their own they'll clear and confirm like normal. Recently I had one transaction get stuck for 12 days then it was rejected and full balance returned to my Mycelium wallet on my phone.

The November 2013 - January 2015 crash of about 86% would price bitcoin around $1,966. Not as bad as the other crash if you want to look at it that way. I think the only thing for sure is what's happened before can happen again with bitcoin.

I recently started using BitWage to get 3% of each paycheck in BTC. I tested out the service for 2 months beforehand by receiving only $10 per paycheck to see how the system worked. The BTC are deposited to my phone wallet, and from there I decide what to do with them. I'm building a new PC for a fathers day gift with parts bought 95% with the paycheck BTCs via Newegg (95% because amazon had a sale on SSDs). Being paid in BTC is the way to go.

It's real easy to get setup on Coinbase or Circle, just takes a few days initially to get accounts linked as they have to comply with some US laws. But I would recommend Circle.com more than Coinbase.com though. When you buy BTC on coinbase, you have to wait an additional 4-5 days before the BTC is available. With Circle, the BTC are available as soon as you purchase. 
If you need any help or have any questions just ask at or and they should help you out. Cheers!

I tried that also. i used command 
- tar xzf bitcoin-0.11.2-linux32.tar.gz
and extracts and makes a folder in the default Firefox download directory. I then do command 
- sudo install -m 0755 -o root -g root -t /usr/local/bin bitcoin-0.11.2/bin/*
and it says something like file or directory doesn't exist. I've also tried changing "/usr/local/bin bitcoin-0.11.2/bin/" to the directory where bitcoin-0.11.2-linux32.tar.gz extracted to but that didn't work also. I don't have the Pi on right now so cant write exactly what it says, but i tried following the Other Linux Distributions instructions to the letter and it still wont install.

I was having a couple of problems when it was on my FreeNAS server. When I had Bitcoin-QT running on Ubuntu in VirtualBox I could never figure out how to forward port 8333 correctly as i never got more than 8 connections. Also it would never get past syncing the last 19 weeks, it was syncing for 2 weeks at 19 weeks. Additionally when i would periodically check Ubuntu through VNC Bitcoin-QT had automatically shut down, despite it set to auto start when Ubuntu starts.
When I setup Bitcoin on a FreeBSD jail in Freenas everything would go fine until I get to parts where I had to enter **bitcoin-cli** commands. Every **bitcoin-cli** command I entered would say **bitcoin-cli: Command not found.** so I could never check its status. I would strongly prefer a GUI as I haven't used command line since MS-DOS days.

For other noobs like me: to navigate to the folder in step 5 type "cd /usr/local/etc/" and to edit the files type "ee rc.conf" and "ee bitcoin.conf"
1. Do you also add "service bitcoin start" in rc.conf or is this a command you type after saving and exiting the file? I've typed that command but bitnodes.21.co says the node is unreachable. If i type "bitcoind" then the node becomes reachable.
2. How do you make this automatically start if FreeNAS reboots?
Also as for SSH into the FreeNAS jail, once signed into FreeNAS via SSH, the command "jls" needs to be entered to get the number for the jail, then type "jexec (jail  to SSH into jail.

I found the best way to run a node on a Raspberry Pi 3 is install Raspbian (I'm using Lubuntu) on a USB hdd and booting the OS from that. There's no configuring mount points or fstab or any of that command line stuff. I recommend using Lubuntu over Raspbian as installing Bitcoin is so much faster, a few mins to install via PPA rather than 1+ hour compiling in Raspbian.
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:12:26
I actually do use Bitcoin-QT interface on my Lubuntu Raspberry Pi 3. I much prefer GUIs to command line and am content with whatever performance decrease there is compared to Raspbian Lite.

You direct deposit any amount or percentage you want to an account # + routing # BitWage provides. I set my direct deposit amount as 5% to BitWage. When BitWage received the funds you have direct deposited it automatically and quickly converts that to Bitcoin, then automatically sends the coins to a public bitcoin address you have provided.
Furthermore BitWage can convert any percent of cash received to Bitcoin (say 90%BTC-10%USD, 30%BTC-70%USD) and send to multiple Bitcoin addresses. 
My setup is this: 5% each paycheck to BitWage, 100% to Bitcoin. 50% of that Bitcoin goes to my Trezor, 50% goes to Mycelium on my phone for everyday spending. 
I have not had any use for a Bitcoin exchange like Coinbase or Gemini since I started using BitWage 2+ years ago. Hope this helps.

I never saw bitcoin as an option. Newegg only gave me options to pay with PayPal, Visa, Amex, and some other methods. How did you get bitcoin as an option?

OK I see now. I don't recall seeing bitcoin on the list for my other parts, I'm going to double check to see if the parts I bought from Newegg (I bought from Amazon, eBay, Superbiiz, etc as well) had bitcoin as option. Why wouldn't they put bitcoin as payment option alongside the other options in my picture?

Not all lottery winners lives are ruined. If a person has trouble managing their personal finances before winning the lottery then they'll have trouble managing their finances after winning too. Playing the lottery tends to attract those who are not so great with their finances. Lottery winners are offered help to manage their new wealth but most turn it down, hince the lottery attracting those bad with personal finance.

Why not? The whole premise of the subreddit is to make someones life better. The system to pick a winner is provably fair. People are under no obligation to donate.  The past 3 drawings people have had problems donating via PayPal and Google Wallet, but their eyes open when they see people donating via changetip. People on this subreddit love and encourage tipping BTC via changetip. is the perfect opprotunity to showcase to people with 0 knowledge of cryptocurrencies what is possible with bitcoin.

So I was reading about anti nutrients because I never actually heard about them. The wiki page said that white beans contain an amylase inhibitor, which prevents amylase from breaking down carbs to sugar.  Why would that antinutrient be a bad thing? To me it sounds like Americans should be eating more beans to lower their sugar intake.
