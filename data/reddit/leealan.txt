come on guys 
we all know bitcoin is a experiment 
and hackers did this 
sure they had a lausy security but 
why not give them a chance 
it will be good for crypto if the comunity sticks together 
yes we all lost some for the moment but keep in mind crypto is risky no one knows the traps befor you fall in it 
i will trade there again if they make it 
and i perfer them to get back to bussines instead of closing

yes i agree with you 
as i always say crypto is so new, such a early state 
and the risk you take as an early adopter will reward in the furute 
isnt that all its about 
and on the way we will see less and less of such hacks 
couse each one will teach how to close the holes 
i mean watching bter and how they deal with this now means they wont give up and thats a good sign

why kidding, bter was not the only one hacked, hacking is the evil not the exchanges they did a good job 
why is everyone asking to drop the victim and not hunt the attacker i realy dont get it 
and did you follow the news ? 
how many companies, exchanges and othere online services have been hacked in the last year 
@_date: 2015-02-18 10:07:20

after spring ...... withdraw of alts and fiat 
but its a bad translation
