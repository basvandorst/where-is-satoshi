I do totally agree that the picture of a coin thing is pretty misleading and hurts people's understanding of it if anything - however I can kind of see that they do need to have a picture of something and a nice shiny coin is more likely to grab attention than a picture of a computer!

hmm although bitocin is nearly instant/nearly free, i don't think that justifies people going around telling everyone it's completely free and totally instant - will just lead people to trust bitcoin supporters less for not describing it accurately in the first place

who is responsible for this recent trend of calling it just "blockchain"? (does it not deserve an article, e.g. 'the?'). This really grinds my gears.

In the UK - It is possible to buy BTC through Coinbase with a Debit card (buy limit starts at £40 GBP per day). 
You do have to submit ID e.g. a passport photo.

This claims that (unlike Satoshi) Mr. Wright's writings were apparently  pro-capitalist, anti-hacktivist and was pro-corporate. 
Some other interesting observations
"The very few times he mentioned bitcoin he didn't even name it as the first alternative to PayPal. He suggested Google Checkout as the most likely digital payment system to replace PayPal’s" 
Personally, I'm not buying the Wired article!

Seems like great news... it looks like Mulvaney is not only pro-bitcoin but also against the fed system as a whole:
Mother Jones obtained audio of Mulvaney's speech to the John Birch Society chapter. In the speech, Mulvaney blasted the Federal Reserve, saying its actions have "effectively devalued the dollar" and "choke[d] off economic growth." He praised bitcoin as a currency that is "not manipulatable by any government."

Can bitcoin golded defeat?
@_date: 2016-12-22 10:35:59
no, because if you use paypal, there is a risk the paypal transfer will be reversed. Your bitcoin sale cannot be reversed so you can easily end up losing money if you deal with a scammer.

it's an interesting moral dilemma...because I think Trump is wrong on SO many levels...but I consider it more likely that bitcoin will succeed if Trump wins, because the chaos it causes will make the opportunities presented by bitcoin and blockchain tech's to revolutionize the entire political process and do away with all these idiots.
I see bitcoin and decentralised governance as the future of politics - it's the system that needs to prevail and the quicker the current system can crash and burn the better...so maybe I should vote trump for the greater good?! even though he's a complete bellend (can't vote anyway, i',m from the UK)
@_date: 2016-12-22 21:14:39
if you short bitcoin, you make profit if the bitcoin price falls. He's saying that you should do that if you are so convinced this is a pump and the price will fall back down again.

thanks for this illuminating post
I think btc is lots of things for different people...and it doesn't really do any of them perfectly YET!
Part of the problem with using btc as a currency for everyday purchases is that everyone else is still locked in to the traditional financial system with their credit cards and atms etc. (especially us privileged enough in the developed westernized nations to have access to all this stuff) 
I can imagine though that in developing countries, the 2.5 billion people without good access to banking, children will grow up without ever needing to go into a bank - and will be able to transact with each other using digital currencies  with a lot less friction and without having to go through a load of exchange hurdles.
Also, another use that is not really an investment or using it as a currency - I have been buying extra bitcoin lately as a hedge - I'm from the UK and see the value of the pound falling lower and lower.. to me it simply  feels safer to keep a decent portion of my savings in Btc. It's not really an investment as such,  I simply trust btc to hold its value a bit better than £ sterling what with all this brexit nonsense!
I don't think its really a problem that people want to use bitcoin for different things and in slightly different ways - and no one "vision" for what bitcoin should be is really any more valid than any other - i think it will probably end up being used for a bewildering array of different reasons, just like the internet is.
@_date: 2016-11-04 19:19:18
why do we need amazon and ebay accepting bitcoin right now? i think the focus should be on maximizing security,  decentralization and functionality of the network for the long term, rather than simply rushing to get a few large retailers accepting it as currency

Well that sucks!
I've never really been sold on the idea of bitcoin debit cards in their current form - if you read the small print,  "The BitPay Visa Prepaid Card is issued by Metropolitan Commercial Bank" - so you are not avoiding banks or being your own bank or anything like this and its not really in the spirit of bitcoin if you are going via a bank!
Though I concede its probably useful for some people

You could try making a shop on Openbazaar. Not many users at the moment, but huge potential for growth and no selling fees.
Perhaps try selling something you're interested in or you can make yourself.
 I made my first sale after having my shop open for a couple of weeks. I think its well worth getting to grips with it and has been a fun experience, there is an OB reddit the guys there are very helpful.
@_date: 2016-11-06 04:29:52

@_date: 2016-11-05 13:34:13
I think your assumption that it's "natural" market is  always going to be "technically savvy people who are willing to deal with all of the really tricky security measures" is short sighted
Not too long ago you would have said the 'natural market' of the internet was only geeks and techically savvy people. now we have kids with their own social media accounts. 
We here are all privleged that we have an existing banking system and atm's we can use and we can compare this experience to bitcoin. But what about kids who will grow up in developing countries? They will have smartphones (because mobile phone tech does permeate even in developing countries) -
But these kids may have no good access to a bank account, atm's etc....for these kids, they may grow up with bitcoin being their only option to transact and send value using their smartphones -  and in comparison  to trusting value with national, hyper inflated,  corrupt, technically inflexible banking operations - cryptocurrency will not pass them by and will appear far superior in pretty much every way
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:38:09
You could add localbitcoins to that list!

Thanks to everyone for your advice - I've now completed the transfer with no problems and all coins safely on Trezor.
Despite all the advice here I must admit I was still pretty nervous about the whole thing as never made such a large transfer in my life before  and have read many horror stories
I look forward to the day when devices like Trezor are widely used and cheap to aquire - To be honest, I think it's the only really viable and practical option for secure bitcoin use and storage for the masses!

gold &amp; fiat doesn't threaten banks - and you can't yet say that banks have "survived the internet", bitcoin tech comes as a result of the internet and could make banks obsolete by allowing people to transact directly with each other

@_date: 2016-07-26 18:03:03
I personally find it frustrating if it takes longer than an hour to get a couple of confirmations.
I am often transferring btc from one market place or exchange to another, and usually can't actually use it until it gets at least 2 confirmations - this period in limbo can be frustrating if I just want to get on with what i'm doing.
Edit - I will add though that I can deal with this frustration if it helps keep bitcoin secure and I do support core.
