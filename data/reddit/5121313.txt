My added perspective.. HODL's have done a purposeful and wonderful job of keeping the bottom from dipping further below and becoming stronger and longer losses to the community.  Thus why the often repeated drops and gains seen in a % repetitious pattern mostly conducted by trading bot's and free form traders, the gain/loss is contained to the usual overall amount traded. (Albeit after weak hands have all sold out and the continuing crypto bashers, fiat manipulators, Govt's have quieted down - Till at least the next larger bull step up over the bears).  Establishing a stronger more solid higher bottom once again without the ingrained fomo.  Higher bottom steps up will be coming once again with the slow growth from gaining worldwide understanding and adoption. (All Just FFT).. Have a great week all !

Bitcoin changes or improvements are coming slower than an Elephant in a "jungle of the adept and hungry". Block Chain size speeds too slow! Segwit, Lighting Network, Specter, Alt-coins, Competing platforms will devour the Elephant if it doesn't speed up. Accept a modified path of sorts, at least pick something downhill even. Then improve on awareness get nimble. Dam! Put on some Air Nike's, Adidas, Hell even Converse do something! Leave the PBOC in the dust.. Embrace Change for the Future.... Lets speed it up BITCOIN!

I've watched the average cost of bitcoin go up, settle, and then rise again (with dips and rises). But upward momentum seems to settle upward, more often than not.. With the same volatility on each rung going higher. I believe with a few rungs left on the ladder to 21 million bitcoins, volatility will diminish, thus there are still more price increases to be had over time. Add the use of the Blockchain increase worldwide (A blockchain — originally block chain — is a distributed database that maintains a continuously-growing list of ordered records called blocks). Along with the billions of individuals world wide with no access to banking but own cell phones. Plus ETFs, Exchanges, ect..still to be born. And you have a demand (even borderless) that still wants or needs to be met. SegWit or Lightning Network as such: (per example) should be the next Bitcoin minor step (finally) forward in acceptance to a larger faster/quicker dissemination and growth to the value of Bitcoin.  So Bitcoin too can "slip through your fingers like money". Add in the halving again in 2020 for good measure. Also then add, as long as Bitcoin can compete globally in the monetary field of transactions on a Global scale with speed and proven thus far "security". I'll buy and hold like I have been.

Who's Greedy Idea was it to cancel instant buy Credit Card (low fee 1%) bitcoin purchases, to a 3% or 4% higher fee instant buy Debit Card only purchases? Is the Halving or hard forking going to result in the same type of greed and abuse to Coinbase customers?

After the loss of "Customers" who they upset or who closed accounts because of Citi's "unfounded PC infringement" on associated Business's. They'll just Jack up ATM fee's, Bounced check fee's ect.. On the poor sheeple that continue banking with them. In order to cover their bottom line for any cumulative loss's derived from their Anti-Second amendment position against Americans and their God Given rights of Freedom, as stated in the Constitution.    (My Opinion - wait three to six months Citi customers will see an increase in their fee's, under some other lame excuse for the increase). Dump your accounts!!

Simply put the buying Power of "Fiat" paper money will keep diminishing  (continuous printing of fiat out of thin air) ... There's a set supply  of Bitcoins ever to be issued.. (21 million).  Plus cryptocurrencies can  be P2P transferred across the globe with no middleman involvement. -  (banks, bankwires, money exchangers, ect). And "Oh yea" no Central Gov't  can control it.. It's decentralized.. and on the Public ledger  (blockchain) for trustless use in every transaction. Plus you don't have  to haul it around  and try to transport ton's of it like you might have to  do with gold (another costly endeavour)... Thus the Moniker Digital  Gold is sometimes applied to Bitcoin, due to it's slowly growing sometimes difficult use in daily small transactions.

Plus Add - "And don't interfere with our beloved over burdened  constantly running 24/7 Fiat printing presses! That are busy creating "paper money" out of Thin Air!   So the BIS can look the other way when all the illegally laundered paper money the BIS services, mixes in with the so called "legitimized" (printed out of thin air) monies.   "So stop trying to create Money- You Crypto Coders ".  While we pursue our massive printing efforts to ensure our world wide control and effort in diminishing  "paper" monies value around the Globe to an actual worth of almost next to zero.

Then there's the Deep State Puppet with glasses "Howdy Doody" himself Congressman Brad Sherman! These are just a few I consider "Tiiiders" that just flat piss me off with their comments obfuscating Bitcoin and all Cryptocurrencies. Please feel free to add more names below..That you feel earned or demonstrate the title of just another "Tiiider" that doesn't have a clue nor ever will. That has or had or is spouting negative Sh!T about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
As the Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Global "Tide" ebbs and flows higher in it's prices and gained accomplishments, the "Tiiiders" you can dam well bet will come out enforce. Declaring everything connected to or associated with Bitcoin or cryptocurrency (under the sun) can't compete or compare to "Fiat" that's created, made out of thin air, and then printed. I'm referring to the "fiat" that is utilized most often by any and all types of Criminals, (political and or blue and white collar). It's also the largest criminally Laundered Currency (paper money) on the Planet. Constantly manipulated by "State Governments around the World" to keep their so called mindless minions and little people in and under control. When the cryptocurrency "Tide" even slightly rushes in flowing higher in value the Louder the "Tiiiders" will declare it's valueless, useless, and has no economic function. While Fiat's purchasing power slowly declines even  sometimes drastically year over year, requiring larger and larger volumes of paper money (fiat/digits written on paper) be accumulated to maintain the same relative buying and spending power. That's why we no longer talk in Millions but in Billions and Trillions. Partial cause, devaluation is always in progress. All the while making sure that the middle man (banks, bad corporations, credit cards, money transfers, fiat currency converters, loan sharks, ect.) get their share of the debt pie. While Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are a trustless  (no trust required or a third person involved) just P2P on an open ledger (blockchain) for all to see and can't be changed. You are also acting as your own bank (hard wallet) too, not needing permission or charged exorbitant fee's per ratio, or the need to meet time constraints. Your just able to send Bitcoin/crypto anywhere anytime globally to anyone that has their own crypto wallet or hard wallet aka Bank. I say be your own "Bank" (cellphone even) and look to the future it's coming faster than you think. And call out these Dinosaur Tiiiders for what they are when they opens their mouths - "Technologically Illiterate Idiot In Denial Extremely Repulsive"

Larger World Wide acceptance of Bitcoin as a storage of value.. And also a growing use as a fiat currency replacement for purchases. (Thanks Japan) to name just a couple. Come on SegWit! What level after bubble bursts? (if and when it does).. Almost always shakes out higher than the sideways level that was stagnate before the bubble. Just Opinions on my part.

Received my 3rd and final overdue pending transaction a day or so late. I have sent 2 Email's (several weeks apart, not transaction related) with "nary" a reply to either one of them so far. They definitely need to angle and focus more effort into their Customer Service Support side of the house, ie: Hire more people, set some sort of reply standard times, Heck maybe even set-up and establish an "IN COUNTRY" such as in San Francisco maybe, an actual "Live" Question and Answer phone bank. Hell could even go as far as a phone bank established in each country they serve, mitigating language barriers. As the Customer base grows (and it is) so should the Customer Service! IMHO... Overall though I still do endorse CoinBase.  Just store your Coins in your own seed wallet if you are a Hodl  ;)

From what I could understand and gather collectively . One could/should definitely support SegWit and BIP148 neither of which is what Wu wants ( SegWit stops covert asicboost and BIP148 is a soft fork) Wu wants to keep things the way they are now because it is his bread and butter for his miners and fee's. Plus these first 2 steps will definitely effect his current growing monopoly attempts, IMHO.   Just want to add  I am not a Core Dev or BU Dev or a shill or whatever, for anyone. Just explaining the way I see it so far, in answer to your question.  "Peace".......

IMHO - Overall on average, each correction (dip) after the high of the roller coaster ride, always seems to settle a little higher than the last stabilized (dip) correction. Sometimes you may need to incorporate a slight time duration variable now and then.  ie: tx times, new sign ups, demand jam, pumpers and dumpers ect...  Sleep knowing the next dip will end up higher than the last.  Sleep and fortitude.. ;)
