Well assuming 1 million people use it today (underestimate) and there are 10 billion people then it needs to go up about 10,000-fold, which is about 2^13.   So 13x8 months=104 months which is 8 years or 9 years.   
However it's much more likely adoption takes an S curve than this type of shape... Just doing the math for you.

All right buddy.  Sorry my second paragraph was entirely wrong.  Here is something true though:
Congress is a bunch of old men in a room signing papers.
@_date: 2015-06-02 11:46:03
your second paragraph is completely wrong.
The point is you're assuming things about how people view the law. 
It's made by people who are just as human as the rest of us, so we should always question the motives behind laws -- and the motives behind harsh sentencing.  The law is made by humans, and humans are capable of questioning it.  Calling someone "legally illiterate" and "uneducated" because they don't agree with the law is silly -- we know what the government's law says, we just think it ought to not be one of their laws,  and bringing attention to that is the best way to get it changed.
It doesn't sit well for a lot of people to see life imprisonment for creating silk road, it seems overly harsh and largely a "fuck you we have all the power"

Someone having an opinion of justice that is against common practice (appeal to authority) makes them neither illiterate nor uneducated (ad hominem).
 Opinions are high in this case since it strikes a chord with many people in this sub.  We all understand that what he did was illegal and he was sentenced for it, however many of us disagree with the law itself and find the sentencing overly harsh.

...I've explained why they are possible to be attacked, regardless of if it is possible in any specific wallet it is certainly possible in the protocol itself, and a wallet implementation demonstrating the attack will follow.
Let's be honest, for many use cases of Bitcoin the point is that it is not always trustworthy, e.g. A cam girl selling videos to a user who wishes to remain anonymous, or a contraband purchase on the darknet where it is easy to make a new identity.   
You'll note satoshi himself mentioned this attack in the conclusion of the whitepaper but only assuming the spender would try to fork the blockchain by hashing, what I'm suggesting is the same attack is possible by paying the miners to fork the blockchain for you.  And that there is in fact no downside to attempting it in many of bitcoins use cases, especially when you remain anonymous.

Ah. I wasn't familiar with Peter R's argument.
And an argument from consequence is a basic tenant of game theory. When you have control of an outcome it would be unwise to make bad decision.
It is similar to why the no arbitrage axiom is true, it's true because if it weren't you should be grabbing that free money and making it true.  In the case of miners, the assumption is they will take the free money.

If you're interested we can talk about it on IRC, as the above poster mentioned Bitcoin does need a standard for fee calculation and this would provide one (namely an equilibrium to this game)

There'd be a fee market even without a blocksize cap.  Otherwise it would be too easy to incentivize miners to fork the blockchain when the coinbase runs out.  By re-spending the same transaction after a single or even double confirm, only with a much higher fee, miners will be incentivized to revert the blockchain and re-write history. Therefore, a fee market exists between a buyer and merchant in any bitcoin transaction.   The fewer confirms you want to  secure your transaction the higher the fee you should post.   This type of attack is especially possible if you are making a transaction moving a volume significantly higher than the average fee reward for a block.
This should be pretty simple to understand, but I'll write the math out if anyone is curious.
@_date: 2016-01-05 17:06:00
Agree, I'm just posting that message everywhere I can so we can get over this hurdle of "no block cap=no miners"
@_date: 2016-01-22 13:08:16
I'm not talking about anyone's paper specifically but a basic intuition, since we tend to assume mining is a competitive industry.

I don't know what Peter R's paper is about but if it is on this topic and has been refuted id love to hear the intuitive form of the argument.

We'll see them for awhile.   All miners try to mine empty blocks between receiving a block header and receiving the actual block.   Reason being they don't know which transactions are already included or not.
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:26:55
Peak demand should still cross the blocksize cap. 
But regardless a fee market exists without a blocksize cap
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:51:43
What you're saying is mostly true, and I don't mean to say that merchants are defenseless.  What I am saying is that there is an incentive structure for a fee market regardless of a block size limit, and that one of the steps merchants can take to prevent fraud is charging a miner fee on the transaction. (thus avoiding playing this game of back and forth with the miners to compete to fork the chain with high probability).
I'm not sure if you're suggesting the spender not play because the payoff asymptotically approaches 0 or not, but he can only gain from attempting it.  It is a dominant strategy for the buyer to attempt a double spend if utility is only measured in BTC payout.
@_date: 2016-01-05 22:16:40
This is not what I'm suggesting at all.   I said nothing about RBF and whether implementing it is good or bad, and I am not defending it.  
I'm saying even at infinite network capacity fees will still exist.

I'm curious if you think the current blocksize limit is the same as the limitation of the network to relay data.   I believe they're distinct things.  In order for the networks ability to relay data to be the limitation then bitcoin would be operating on that edge (e.g. that limit would be a binding constraint in its optimal operation.  Instead the blocksize limit is.)
@_date: 2016-02-09 04:04:25
?? What? The worst that happens is the network will reject the block. I'm not following what you think will happen here 
@_date: 2016-02-23 02:44:12
Phrenico,  I believe the idea is to supply as much as possible without the hard limit, and the price is the price.
@_date: 2016-02-23 03:02:11
I'm pointing out the edge case here.  Clearly increased fees makes holding Bitcoin less desirable. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 11:23:33
Regardless, you now admit the transaction cap is artificial.  The rest isn't what I'm arguing about
@_date: 2016-02-09 03:27:26
The point im trying to make is that the limit is indeed artificial, contrary to your first assertion.   The idea is the have no artificial blocksize limit at all, and let the blocks size themselves. Blocks that are too large will end up orphaned and miners will learn to be wiser.
@_date: 2016-02-23 02:41:06
What if each transaction cost 1 btc? Would that not make a Bitcoin much more worthless?
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:30:28
Joe the fee is .1% on most exchanges then .001 btc to move across the blockchain.   Fees are small in crypto and that's one of the main benefits
@_date: 2015-11-26 20:55:54
I like that you say metcalfes law, but then suggest transactions and users are proportional.  The very point of the law is that the square or transactions and users are proportional.   1000 fold increase in transactions ~ 30 fold increase in users 
@_date: 2015-11-27 22:56:48
I'd agree with that.  I was just pointing out that metcalfes law, which you mentioned, and the conclusion you came to, were at odds.
@_date: 2015-11-08 14:28:42
I actually think his solution is very realistic.  This isn't unlike how electricity is bought in power markets (bidding), wallet users always have the option of setting their min and max transaction the same, and it'll be like nothing happened to them.  But how to cancel transactions that didn't confirm is the question?
