Literally I could potentially access the entire Ledger's customer base. I can't believe you guys are taking this so lightly. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:20:13
They still didn't get it right. 
I sent you a PM. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:35:41
Thanks for forwarding it. 
I see they tried fixing it yet again. Unfortunately they **still** didn't get it right. I have PMed you and u/murzika
Third time's a charm right?  
EDIT: To address your question.. It's not personal, I just think that people being able to access and expose personal info for the entire Ledger customer base is a big deal.

I sent them a PM, not going to take it down though. Who knows when they will respond (people should know). I already tried getting in touch with them on their own forums too.

Yea.. I prefer core too. 
I have nothing against their product though I actually ordered one for myself too and I'm looking forward to ~~getting~~ dissecting it. I am just very skeptical these days. I have lost a lot in the past. 
EDIT: The coins are probably safe, this is just a flaw with the way they have their website setup.. I can access your address, telephone  payment method, etc...

I haven't disclosed how it's done. Part of me does want to take this down, the other part wants to let the world know about it because if we're trusting our coins with the hardware/firmware these guys designed how can they overlook something this simple?

I understand that there is some kind of code on the ledger device. And we cannot see the code that's on the device. 
So hypothetically speaking how do we know that a malicious programmer or factory worker hasn't inserted dormant malicious code into the device? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:39:39
You're saying it has a chip that stores the information and that the information never leaves the device... That's great for security and all.. 
but how do I know that the device doesn't have dormant malicious code that is set to wake up at a future date and send all wallet/password information to a third party when an internet connection becomes available? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:28:44
So what if the private key is forwarded to a third party because of unknown malicious code inserted into the ledger during programming/manufacturing or mailing? 
Edit: Apparently they ship them with "tamper proof" stickers sealing the boxes.. (though I wonder how truly tamper proof they are). 
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:37:34
How and where has this been validated? 
And also how do we know that a malicious piece of code isn't set to wake up at a preset time in the future... And send wallet/password information to a third party when an internet connection becomes available?

Ok then. Humor me. ELI50
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:26:02
Ok very nice thread. Thank you. 
What I'm understanding is that it's not entirely trustless and that we have to basically "trust" ledger's checks and balances. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:43:31
It's my understanding that the devices come with software already installed on them... So being able to see the open source code is great (ty for link) but how do I know that's the actual code that's running on the device when I get it in the mail?

Banks dont ask you these types of questions when you go to spend YOUR money. 
They already know everything there is to know about me and they STILL want more. 
Example.. 
"Help us understand your current source of income/funds for your bitcoin purchases. Please be as specific as possible; any supporting documentation you can provide (e.g. your LinkedIn profile, if available) will help expedite the completion of this review."
lmao they want my LinkedIn profile ffs.

They have no problem when you bring your money to them. 
They start giving you problems when you take your money back. 
@_date: 2016-05-18 19:55:29
That's the thing. I'm not anonymous. They literally have ALL my identifying info. Bank Account/ Credit Card.. SSN you name it. They STILL want more.
