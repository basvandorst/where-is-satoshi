What do you care? That’s awesome! I did the same for my son.

I just got it. I have moved coins to it. But that’s it.
I like carrying it in my wallet. I like not needing a computer to use it. I like it more then my Trezor.

“The wallet also utilises facial recognition, as well as passcodes and touch ID to carry out its 2+1 factor authentication”
I have a cool wallet S, and none of these things are true. Although the company says a passcode option is in the works.
