Could you elaborate on that thought?

Bitcoin is clearly set for adoption when normal people have to these things to minimize fees, especially when it peaks at 50 dollars per transaction.

Whoever wrote the article just spewed out words in quantities in hopes of getting enough of them to call it an article.

Velic.io is a all-in-one platform with fiat onramps, decentralized key management, various of alts outside of Bitcoin, and returns 70% of their revenue back to Vela holders :). Good luck on your crypto journey and may the moon be with ya!

"Rights" mean you control your own assets. It is a set of responsibilities that was taken away from you right before your eyes...

Fees are cheap right now but will go up to $70 with a 7 day confirmation time per tx once it gains activity and eventually bursts again.

Designed to pump; historically it goes up up up and outperforms all other traditional assets you would wanna invest in.
@_date: 2019-06-19 22:21:52
Historically if you far enough in time Bitcoin only goes up so its not really a problem - As long as the 2 come to an agreement.

Proof of stake was an alternative, there's also Proof of Contribution. It takes the best things out of centralization and decentralization. Not all but some projects stay censorship resistant whilst also being instant. Also, could you please tell me why I would ever use protocols like Segwit and Lightning. That's work, effort. I do not care enough to download and learn about these things when I can just stick to alternatives that does the job better in general?
It really bothers me having Bitcoin holders telling you to "use this and that" which even requires technical knowledge as well as effort. Those are big obstacles and mass adoption will never come by if that exists, and I personally don't want to be apart of that. I suggest that you start looking at things objectively and being less tribalistic about your Bitcoin and the world will open up. It is in my experience that people who do not choose to adapt to advancements are stuck there in their timezones forever.
Just to give you another example: Cryptokitties lose 99% of it's users due to the difficulty of metamask (Source: Cryptokitties CEO). They basically give up because it's too hard. Can you please tell me what's so different about Bitcoin?

Yes fees are low since mass adoption is gone. Every time people get into Bitcoin the fee will skyrocket, hence why we stopped going up after 20k; during late 2017 you had to wait for many days and pay up to $40 dollars for 1 transaction? (Source: [
You're implying something as if New York was having good traffic when nobody is using the streets but in reality the traffic is terrible because it's the most populated area per m\^2 in the word. Wake up.

It doesn't matter what it was. The point still stands as it caused the volume to spike and Bitcoin clearly couldn't handle it hence my first post: *"You probably won't lose your Bitcoins from a hacker but you will lose it from high fees".* Surely that quote doesn't relate to now but it will in the foreseeable future so you might as well stick to Proof of stake until Bitcoin actually has been fixed.

Because it was eventually revealed once it was resolved. The point i was making was that they had to keep it a secret because of how bad the bug actually was.


Nope, I hold very little in ICX and that is all; might as well assume I hold 0 tokens.

@_date: 2019-01-21 02:47:15
I am talking to a wall right now. The Bitcoin bug (in 2018) was a disaster and the devs even kept it secret because they knew how bad it was. Read up, kiddo.
*"That sounds like something an altcoiner would say" -* I hold very little in one token currently just for the sake of developing dApps. I don't really know how that makes me an "altcoiner".
Also, Proof of Stake is not liable to get hijacked by large coin holders because the current exchanges doesn't even offer enough tokens for you to buy. And even if they managed to accumulate enough tokens (making everyone rich) they would still have an incentive to just hold them and be good actors, but also morally.

No i didn't "look it up". I am not enforcing information bias here. You are simply ignoring every bad detail about Bitcoin because you are tribalistic about it. It doesn't matter if the fees set new highs because major adoption comes in. People like you will always say: "it's simple just use lightning", even though it's a difficult process for those who don't care enough about it. Lightning is also off-chain technology meaning Proof of work doesn't apply. How is that better/safer than pos/dfbt/poc where as you have an incentive to be a trustworthy candidate &amp; forge new blocks as well as voting for good actors?
@_date: 2019-01-21 00:14:57


Yes it's not hard for tech nerds and people who are incentivized for it (holders). But if you ask the average Joe he will not care enough to use segwit. You clearly agree with lightning being hard to use since you ignored that completely.
Also Bitcoin doesn't "work", it is barely functioning is a more fitting term. It has already had implications multiple times. Worth mentioning is not only 2010 but also in 2018 the printing bug that could have led to billions of Bitcoins if it weren't for a Bitcoin Cash developer to have found the bug. You could look it up yourself.

I don't see a moon anywhere?
Nice cake though, I'll have a couple ones like that for a later date.
