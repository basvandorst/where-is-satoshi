You know if they really do have the police involved it would not be that hard to give the division and branches of the police that are involved. Kind of reminds me of that guy who tried to prove he was Satoshi but failed to do the obvious proof.

As with all this stuff they need marketing, marketing and more marketing with really good docs and videos.  I think there getting there but it takes a good marketing department.  They should get some cues from the Ether guys.  They managed to market that as the solution to everyone's problems and people fell for it :-)

I sold everything that mr Worm @_cryptoworm_ sent and buy cash USD$ on localbitcoins. I have no trust to crypto  
Are we supposed to believe this lady sold $250,000 on localbitcoins the same day she received it. I assume this is all part of the game.

Bitfinex has been hacked by btcdrak in Bitcoin
[–]MemoryStealers -2 points 1 year ago 
I'm Roger Ver, long-time Bitcoin advocate and investor. Today, I'm at the BitFinex world headquarters in the United Kingdom. I had a nice chat with BitFinex CEO, Raphael Nicolle, about their current situation. He showed me multiple bank statements, as well as letters from banks and lawyers. I'm sure that all the current coin redistribution problems at BitFinex are being caused by the traditional banking system, not because of a lack of liquidity at BitFinex. The traditional banking partners that BitFinex needs to work with are not able to keep up with the demands of the growing Bitcoin economy. The dozens of people that make up the BitFinex team are hard at work establishing additional banking partners, that eventually will make dealing with BitFinex easier for all their customers around the world. For now, I hope that everyone will continue working on Bitcoin projects that will help make the world a better place.

There are no known independent pictures or videos of Bitfinex’s CEO, and his current whereabouts are likewise unknown. Raphael Nichole or someone going by that name has however, been part of bitcoin since 2011, seemingly investing in numerous schemes that offer incredibly high returns, with the most prominent being Bitcoin Savings and Trust [BST] run by “pirate 40” aka Trendon Shavers. In vigorously defending the Ponzi scheme throughout, Raphael Nicole states at one point:

@_date: 2015-12-31 10:16:58
Is it April 1st?
@_date: 2015-12-26 07:46:18
Updated to show as wild guess. Seems reasonable to assume some announcement will come out early next year. 
@_date: 2015-12-14 09:26:25
So let's assume he buys a cup of coffee with bitcoin.  He needs to report the item, date and calculate the gain based on the 1st bitcoin he bought at 200 dollars or the last bitcoin he bought that cost him $400 ?
@_date: 2015-12-31 05:11:40
Perhaps because the devs got tired of the few posters here who keep posting and making it sound like it's the end of bitcoin.  I prefer to put my trust in the devs thanks.

Does everyone forget that BU is 99.9999% code created by the core team that they complain about so much.  I am not aware of the BU guys making a single contribution that has helped Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 05:31:13
Plus ten times bigger and full of transactions for cups of coffee and cookies so nobody except a few could have there own node. Thankfully he didn't do this. 
@_date: 2017-02-16 11:01:54
When's the estimated release date?
@_date: 2017-02-01 11:17:08
That would be the most valuable information of all !
@_date: 2017-02-05 05:29:43
I know I was just giving him the benefit of the doubt.  He was certainly there from the beginning but I hear a lot of people saying he didn't exactly set the world on fire with his skills. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 04:00:57
Either still in your wallet or with coinbase.  Just be patient. No need to worry unless your life depends on that transaction executing. While waiting you can sit here and read all the comments from alt coin pumpers that will tell you that your problem is an indication that bitcoin has failed :-) 
@_date: 2017-02-02 07:04:34
Are there any companies (not including paid off Chinese miners and the boring never give up BU paid trolls that I am sure will answer this) that have declared they do not support SegWit?  As far as I know 100% support of companies support it as a solution to increase block size immediately,  to fix maleability and to allow multiple 2nd layer solutions
@_date: 2017-02-03 01:37:35
All's quiet with that for the last few weeks. I thought we were supposed to be getting an announcement soon. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 17:13:36
You are talking rubbish and you know it.  Give it a rest and stop trying to spread FUD like this.  
@_date: 2017-02-02 08:49:46
I used to think they were a bunch of idiots but now I think of them as paid trolls and alt coins pumpers. The lengthy, biased and incorrect arguments they come up with could only come from some reasonably intelligent people that are being paid to cause problems and divide the bitcoin community.  Many of those same posters are here in this forum also trying to spread FUD, promote BU and in some cases promote things which would clearly be a risk to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 02:19:43
This looks like pretty big news!
@_date: 2017-02-01 13:54:41
See what happens when BU blocks SegWit.  Hope you will continue to push for SegWit so we can get this BU rubbish laid to rest and move on.
@_date: 2016-01-20 16:32:06
That's correct as the core has clearly identified that in the short term there plans for segwit will increase the block size and longer term they will evaluate increasing the block size. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 17:14:44
Well I would suggest buying more if you could. I just bought in the last few days. 2016 is looking to be one of the best years for Bitcoin ever. So many new things on the horizon. 
@_date: 2017-02-27 16:53:56
Considering this is your 2nd post and you have been using reddit for less than 20 days you seem to thing you know a lot.  Typically posters like yourself are just trying to stir up trouble but I'm sure you're not like that kind of person. oh sorry for editing my post a few minutes after I created it.  It seems to have upset you.  I suggest maybe wait 1-2 minutes after you see something so you can reply in an appropriate manner.

These people are not seriously concerned about fees. They are just part of the make block size as big as possible and bitcoin as centralized as possible group. They post whenever they get an opportunity to.

I am very glad that core:

The bit about putting Bitcoin at risk if they don't get the perfect solution is absolutely not correct. Imagine that was an airplane that Brian was in.  Would he prefer high volume or safety!

He knows it and of course that's what his aim is !
@_date: 2017-02-21 05:04:04
The OP is a new poster.  Almost no posts about bitcoin and then just now he suddenly posts like an expert. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 13:59:44
Have you completed and tested your thin block solution. That's great to hear that the problem is now solved. 
@_date: 2016-03-02 13:58:32
You can't tell that to the Ethereum posters here :-)  They won't believe you. 
@_date: 2016-03-02 08:37:41
Yeah and I don't continually post that the sky is falling like the hundreds of other posters.  Here again in this post we have an example of that.  
@_date: 2016-03-03 14:14:59
The op along with others who are trying to cause problems are just spreading FUD. Meanwhile the future has never looked better for bitcoin. I stopped daily buys about a week ago but will start again soon after I have some more cash come in from my business. 
@_date: 2016-03-05 08:18:32
He's become too stupid to realize what you are talking about.  I remember once I had two friends. I didn't see them for a few years and met up with one of them. I asked where the other was these days and the guy I met replied "he's lost his mind". Possibly this could have happened to Gavin.  We all go that way in the end. Some of us earlier than others. 
@_date: 2016-03-22 15:17:32
I am still here because I have a big investment in bitcoin and I'm sick and tired of hearing never ending FUD posts.

Your 2nd post and you're asking this question :-)  I suggest you spend a while on this forum and you'll find there is a lots of talk about sensible solutions. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 10:46:19
As you've not responded to a request for the transaction id then I guess it's not so important. Or are you just looking for another transaction id that you can give here to try and justify a problem?

Best post I read all day.  
@_date: 2016-01-19 19:44:02
yep and in particular I find it amusing that the guy lists all the problems with support for a product that is still in development as though the problems are major failures with the product.  For example at this point "Does the Mycelium bitcoin wallet support the Lightning Network to make payment transactions?  NO" really does sound pretty stupid.  Do you expect wallets to support a product that's not yet ready in full test mode?
@_date: 2016-03-05 08:12:16
Well there's a reason for that.  Something to do with the fact that the guy and his team of 2-3 developers are trying to take over control from 40-50 hard working core developers.

@_date: 2016-03-01 16:14:17
I think it's not ethereum guys.  Most of the posters of this type of thread show that they have interests in bigger block sizes is you look back in the posting history. Having said that I saw some of the spam posters with Montero postings earlier so could be them. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:23:45
What's going on is one of the more childish developer kids that didn't get what he wanted left bitcoin a couple of months to join a banking group.  His new employers gave him his first job which was to attempt to damage the reputation of bitcoin as much as possible and asked for help from some reporters to make sure his rant got a lot of exposure. In the meantime the bitcoin core guys continue to do their work and bitcoin keeps getting better.  every day that goes by.

Yeah that's what a lot of us are thinking. Brian, Gavin, Mike. These are the guys that might have or are in the process of making more enemies than anyone else in the bitcoin field.  I wonder if Brian's  problem is due to an inferiority complex related to hair loss. Oh maybe I should not talk about that.
@_date: 2016-01-21 09:09:49
Great legacy for him and his family.  The guy who caused around one billion dollars of asset loss for perhaps hundreds of thousands of people.  Quite a few blog entries out there thanking him for his help and wishing him well which is all well and good but I think they are hiding what they really want to say.  The guy lost the friendship of 99% of the bitcoin developers and that is something he will never be able to get back.

Seems like we go up 2-3 and then fall off 1.  These days I am pretty happy with all that is happening with bitcoin.  The sky has never seemed more blue to me even if many redditors are still staring at the ever more tiny clouds and predicting rain.

FUD post that a subtle variation of this. Honestly I don't know why people like you are still here and talking in this manner trying to suggest that everything proposed or supported by anyone who is not part of the Bitcoin Classic group of 4-5 developers and Coinbase / Circle exchanges is not going to happen. This quote applies to you:

I'd say bitcoin is more than fine.  It is two days closer to a lot of great new features and the core devs have kept calm while everyone else has gone into a panic caused by the trolls here endlessly repeating we have to move to Bitcoin Classic or the world will come to an end.  I bought more bitcoin at 410, 390 and 370.  Yeah my timings not perfect but I don't regret the recent purchases. I am not looking to make my fortune in a few months I am thinking long term.

@_date: 2016-01-15 13:07:55
I left a job a while back. I had an evening out with the team, they wished me well, I wished them well and said I would be back and I'll keep in touch.  Compare that to what Mike did.  Well one thing is for certain he might have friends with R3 his new company but I think if there was anyone who respected him before he lost that with his final rant. Glad to see the guy move on so the real developers can get on with the work in hand. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:13:22
I don't know for sure? Do you know? All I can say is the main core developers who have well over 100 years of combined experience are suggesting to hold off for the short term.  Who would you believe.  The reddit "we want more" group or a group of experts?
@_date: 2016-01-18 15:08:45
Have you read the scaling roadmap in detail and looked at the list of signers:
@_date: 2016-01-21 18:07:32
Have you suggested this to the core guys. I suggest you work on a white paper and publish it for review which is the normal way of suggesting major changes. Once reviewed by the core team then I'll listen otherwise suggestions by Reddit members mean pretty much nothing. Thanks
@_date: 2016-01-16 07:54:50
It is a developer computer so if you were going to be involved in early development for the 21 products then yes it may be a good buy if you want to have something up and running out of the box. Some argue that you could set up your own computer for much less so bear that in mind.  It does not sell itself as a computer for anyone wishing to make any money with mining.
@_date: 2016-01-11 12:13:09
Are you under the impression that you will have to pay Blockstream to use side chains or the LN?  From what I understand they are open source and yes by making them open source I do consider them to be the good guys at Blockstream.  Don't you feel the same with something that a company gives you the code to use yourself?
@_date: 2016-03-05 11:05:08

Here's yet another announcement.  Again the formatting is not that good but if you read it you can also see mention of core's plans to increase the block size. This announcement is one month old now:
@_date: 2016-01-22 03:40:23
What were the dates you saw last time you checked core plans for release of segwit?  Last time I checked it was April this year. Not 2018!  As for LN. What were the dates last time you checked. Have you not noticed there's more than one version in test right now?
@_date: 2016-01-07 17:54:43
Don't understand you.  Do you expect it to have full support from all wallets a couple of days after it is put into a test network?
@_date: 2016-03-05 06:33:53
They would like bitcoin to go in the direction of the path that is best for them.  You might not call that a takeover but when Gavin is on the payroll and when they are suggesting a move to the code run by Gavin's "team" of 2-3 developers that sounds like trying to take over to me. 
@_date: 2016-03-02 09:43:47

Bitcoin Classic dev team are not even active developers any more. If you count totals then Bitcoin Core - 149 releases · 337 contributors.  Bitcoin Classic - 0 releases 5 contributors.

@_date: 2016-03-06 17:51:06
I rather doubt your average user is busy reading this reddit and as a user myself I noticed no problem with transactions. Who are these discouraged users that you talk of.  Command line, low fee spammers?
@_date: 2016-03-03 16:17:15
I have started to think that 99% of the "my transaction is slow posts" are FUD for the media.  Some people are very busy hoping to make bitcoin fail.  
@_date: 2016-03-01 09:03:33
I wonder why this is happening to you.  I moved bitcoins from coinbase to bitcoin hardware wallets over the last few days and had the confirmations went through without any problems. I did notice the transactions took 1-2 minutes (just yesterday) to show up on my wallet web page but they showed as confirmed with 15 minutes. I suppose your fee was too low. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 09:16:20
The only thing that has failed is Mike's ability to get what he wants. After leaving to join R3 his last parting gift to bitcoin was to cause as much damage as he could.  What a guy !

Probably best not to take too much notice of Mike Hearn. His first commit to Bitcoin caused a hard fork  and the price dropped about 35% in a matter of minutes. More recently Mike along with Gavin were pushing for a GB block sizes with no testing. Then even more recently Mike went to join the banks to work on their blockchain.

This could be a good business case for a new type of bank that actually supports bitcoin.

I and I think most others feel the same way. No idea who he's working for but it certainly seems like he's not helping Bitcoin these days. Hopefully he'll give up and join R3 one day.

Good news for a change.  
@_date: 2016-03-22 11:00:48
I very much agree with this guy when he says this:  "One thing that has been a constant in the Bitcoin space is the disinformation spread by the mainstream media about its viability". It will be interesting for me to see how the Classic/Coinbase supporters and FUD promoters respond to this article. I am sure they will try hard to discredit what the guy has to say. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 10:40:54
Going forward Mike Hearn will for the rest of his life be considered as the laughing stock of Bitcoin and the guy who tried the hardest to break it. It's sad really as if he had done the right thing and made positive contributions he could have gone down in history as one of the guys who helped create the most important digital currency the world has ever known.
@_date: 2016-01-09 11:23:22
Yes it is. Just look at the people who pushing hardest to upset things. One of them was Gavin who seemed to not notice that the fellow members of his organization were criminals while taking a nice big salary. One other is Mike Hearn who has now left bitcoin and joined the R3 group. That leaves assorted trolls who I am guessing are not making all this noise for the benefit of bitcoin.  I am thinking that once we all stop this never ending block size debate then the same guys will come out of the woodwork to complain about other things the Core devs are doing. I'm actually glad some of this debate is moderated off the board.

I don't think there's enough space on this page to list how stupid it would be to switch to classic.  As you are a Classic Promoter then I rather doubt there is any point in us telling you what you already know.

Do you have international shipping yet?  When I use Trezor it gives me an option once connected to enter a passcode that's then used as a 25 word so the Trezor can effectively have multiple accounts. Does KeepKey have something similar?

Grow up and come back in 6 months and complain if it's not in the roadmap by then. In the mean time stop trying to cause issues when there is no issue. I think I can speak for most of the people here when I see we're sick and tired of posters like yourself who do nothing more than promote conflict and try to distort the facts.  Go back to r/btc

He moved to R3 the banking consortium a couple of months ago.  All this rant is being made months after he already left bitcoin.

I suggest reading this comment so you will see where block size is heading:  
@_date: 2016-01-19 19:16:43
A common sense interview about the block size that will be completely lost on those reddit stay at home experts who are fixated on promoting alternative solutions.  
@_date: 2017-02-01 09:51:57
Interesting idea but those HUGE fonts on the first page need to be more normal size. Something the size of the r/bitcoin title at the top of this page or small would look much better.  My whole screen filled up with them. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 12:40:09
Can you guys ever stop this continual attempt to push for an alt coin.  It's as annoying as when you were all pushing for XT which was a complete failure.  
@_date: 2016-03-03 19:05:08
Don't know but these days this reddit is 50% FUD and at the same time Bitcoin is getting stronger and stronger. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:26:18
Can you tell me what good things Roger has done lately, not for himself, but for bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-03-04 11:07:50
An old tweet but nothing has changed and seems like they are still doing this while at the same time saying they need bigger blocks. What a joke. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 12:41:13
haha I think that poster is trying to suggest that which at least made me laugh.
@_date: 2016-01-13 10:52:04

@_date: 2016-01-21 18:11:24
There is no feud other than that being created by groups trying to cause problems. Have you checked the core roadmap where they agreed to implement segwit, look at block transmission speed up and then test and review the impact of block size increases. Do you feel it's best to decide  on a date before implementing easier changes and before doing research into the implications?
@_date: 2016-03-05 05:19:49
The only problem out there is with company manipulation of the media.  Keep up the good work with what you are doing.  You have many real supporters while Coinbase has many fake posters !
@_date: 2016-01-15 14:48:15
If I recall XT takes effect when 95% of the mined blocks have an appropriate flag. The reality is that on January 11th exactly 0 out of 1,000 blocks had that flag set.  I would not call it a split when the percentage of miners that agreed to XT were exactly zero.  Now that the XT guys have not got their way the one of them left to join a rival company and the other tried to promote Bitcoin Classic. 
In the mean time the core developers are coding as usual. I think they are tired of the bullshit and prefer just to get on with the job. The only thing that changed with Bitcoin recently is that we're a lot closer to really good new advances that are in the works. 
@_date: 2016-03-03 12:19:50
Did it take you so long to figure that out ?  I don't care what other's think any more, in my opinion the guy is clueless or being well paid to cause as much damage as possible. 
@_date: 2016-01-08 12:20:51
95% of them are good for scamming people.
@_date: 2016-01-10 13:44:05
Yes agreed but I am sure many will try to argue it won't be enough.  After SegWit from what I recall there are also other proposals that would make it easier to move to a larger block size.  Looking forward to the day when all the "give us big blocks yesterday" guys calm down.
@_date: 2016-01-21 18:20:42
LN, side chains and other payment networks are like the Internet of the 1990.  We don't know what's going to come out of them all but there are more possibilities on the horizon than most of us could start to imagine.

Here we go with more BU pumper lies.  
@_date: 2016-03-01 13:01:02
So funny. I just predicted a new bitcoin dead post 4-5 hours ago and now here it is.  What a joke with these guys.  First fill up with spam transactions, then sit back make a lot of posts and then post to say bitcoin as ecash is dead ! 
@_date: 2017-02-27 07:29:32
I'm glad to see you at least support increasing the block size with segwit and possible other improvements later on. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 14:39:48
I have a feeling this was not a very difficult thing to do.

haha these guys are like parrots. They can't stop repeating the same thing. I have to wonder if these are outsourced trolls. I had a friend who's girlfriend's job was to do the exact kind of thing but not for Bitcoin.  Her pay was based on the number of posts she made promoting a product.  She didn't earn much but it kept her busy. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 18:15:39
Yeah this is what I am thinking.  I'll keep this post bookmarked in case it is needed. 
@_date: 2016-03-05 05:25:28
He's calling it Flex Cap.  No cap on block size so voting for Classic is basically voting for Bitcoin XT or Unlimited all over again.  Even if tomorrow Classic gives you 2MB then the plans are for removal of the block size limitation which is exactly what the guy was trying to do 6 months ago with his crazy plans.   
@_date: 2016-03-03 07:23:46

No, only every single day since the "we want a hard fork now" group didn't get there way and the miners decide to trust the combined experience of the Core developers. I fully expect more of these threads to start flooding reddit as anyone can create users here and spam the forum.
@_date: 2016-01-20 17:47:18
Adding conjoin is already in development for mycelium wallet. Confidential transactions are being looked into for bitcoin as soon as segwit is working or same time. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 21:42:53
There appears to be a group of new individuals on reddit who are taking every opportunity to make it appear that a fork is likely to happen. Some of these posters are posting about it on the first day of joining reddit. I think this might give you a clue as to what is happening both on reddit and through the numerous blog posts that have started to appear by new authors. Blogs which are being promoted by these same new posters.   
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:24:14
No comment from me about Roger this time but regarding this video. Either the presentor is dumb, he knows nothing or he is a paid troll trying to push BU.  Most of what he says is incorrect. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:27:24
Can you please tell us all why you feel it is bad solution.  Hopefully your knowledge is greater than all those far more technical guys who are saying how good a solution it could likely be.  If not then perhaps better for you not to try and comment. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 02:51:55

@_date: 2016-01-18 15:07:36
@_date: 2016-01-22 06:04:43
These kind of posters are trying to disrupt bitcoin and have no interest in the truth. They are hoping that by continuously talking about something they can fabricate new problems.
@_date: 2016-01-01 16:38:15
Unfortunately no longer correct.  Moore's law is slowly changing as it becomes more and more difficult to reduce the size of transistors. See this quote by Intel:
Intel confirmed in 2015 that the pace of advancement has slowed, starting at the 22 nm node around 2012, and continuing at 14 nm. Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel, announced that "our cadence today is closer to two and a half years than two.” This is scheduled to hold through the 10 nm node in late 2017.[20] He cited Moore's 1975 revision as a precedent for the current deceleration, which results from technical challenges and is “a natural part of the history of Moore's law.”[21][22][23]
@_date: 2016-01-20 17:20:50
I am sure the poster is aware of this.  There have been over ten posts written in this same writing style just today.  This one may be the different one but I assume they are all from the same person who continuously tries to push for bitcoin classic.  
@_date: 2016-01-18 08:55:48
Thanks - You made me laugh :-)

Very good news. Is Segwit still on schedule for an April release? 
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:11:13
I notice this.  I think most of these posts are spam.  There's going to be one or two real posters but the posters that know enough to post the question know what they are doing and know why the transactions don't get confirmed. Funny how none of them ever say "wish we had Segwit so are fees would be lower" 
@_date: 2016-01-21 20:45:38
I see thank you for the clarification.
@_date: 2017-03-05 23:24:23
That would be a lot more interesting than a stand for your Trezor.  Would be good if Trezor guys could show there support for Segwit and Lightning through their blog rather than this kind of thing.

So now the truth comes out "I don't know what time it is, but any minute now there will be a New York Times article saying Mike Hearn broke up with Bitcoin and called it a failed experiment." 
@_date: 2016-01-21 15:50:12
Usually I see a post or two ever hour from the same group of reddit Bitcoin Classic promotion guys I have seen nothing posted in the last 4-5 hours from them.  Perhaps they are all having a "what to do next" meeting?
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:52:26
I believe this same question with minor variation has already been asked at least five times today by other members of the bitcoin classic promotion group.  Please refer to your group members for the answer to this question. Thank you 
@_date: 2016-01-21 18:12:24
There are a group of people who have a lot to gain if it could be considered dead.  Just like any business gains a lot if they can discredit the competition.  Sad really but that's the way things are these days.
@_date: 2016-01-21 20:38:34
The SWIFT banks settlement network is pretty useful and serves every bank in the world.  Do you think that money there is no good because it can't be used to buy a coffee ? If you feel worried about bitcoin  buy a Starbucks card.

Why didn't you mention that at the Scaling Bitcoin conference if it was such a concern to you?

FUD post if I ever read one. 
@_date: 2016-03-09 09:47:09
I believe a micro payment wallet would not be worth so much.  I read about it a while ago. The plan is to collect the information on pages that have a tagged bitcoin address and then at intervals use that data to make micro-payments to those addresses.  I guess we could have the situation where 21.inc chips are used to mine some satoshis that are used as part of this payment.  No idea really but I guess the future will reveal some interesting ideas. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 07:22:41
A New Year, lots of new announcements coming up, China troubles and getting close to the day (January 11th) when we can all breath a sigh of relief and the letters X T will have no more meaning.

This was communicated but very poorly.
@_date: 2017-03-29 15:31:24
That's a pretty clear message that they have no interest at all in supporting BU and that they feel any BU fork will be treated as an ALT coin and no part of their business. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 12:12:06
Some last ditch attempts to salvage BU from the pumpers. These days anytime I read: 
"I’m for larger blocks, so I run a BU node."
I am pretty sure the guys's a paid troll :-) 
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:54:39
Yeah but I bet Roger can't resist the temptation to cause more trouble.  Basing that on the way he has behaved up to now. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 11:46:09
Check out the roadmap and you will find core have already mention of a 2,4 and 8MB there and that's the roadmap agreed to by all the core devs.  The problem is nobody is looking and I think most have given up on this reddit and I can't really blame them for that. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:39:28
Sounds like this guy has no coin and is hoping for the old days when it was $100 :-)  Now I come to think of it that's probably what all of these "bitcoin is dead" trolls are hoping for.

Why would anyone in their right mind invest in something like that? I have a friend a few years ago who was telling me he made 100% a year.  He stopped telling me about it when the company went bust and he lost everything.  Too many rubbish ponzi schemes out there these days :-(

Thanks for this information. Can you provide a few more details,  perhaps a white paper documenting your findings and have this validated by the core developers who have well over 100 years of combined experience with bitcoin. 
Then we'd be happy to listen.

@_date: 2016-01-21 16:14:39
I'm just wondering. Do you consider you know better than the large group of core developers who thought it safer to hold off and look at other solutions in the short term?  
@_date: 2017-03-15 06:25:17
So far they are happy mining and setting a flag to pretend it is BU.  Do you really think they are so dumb as to mine with BU code that's supported by 1-2 developers rather than the tried and proven code supported by 100 or more core developers.

10-20 profiles on the the bitcoin reddit are continually bashing bitcoin and stirring up trouble on every thread they can. You'll probably see some of the guys on this thread. I think it's something we just need to ignore as they have a lot to gain by trying to make bitcoin fail.

I don't think there's any need for a developer. I run the free Visual Studio Community edition and I have used a few of the Azure services. In some cases all that's needed is someone to create an account and copy paste some C# code into the sample applications and click "Publish".

Did you not see the segwit roadmap which aims for April.  I think you need to see that before talking about such a ridiculous option as Classic?

Read the plans and look at the signers
@_date: 2016-01-16 09:20:13
I have not heard of any person or company that does not want segwit so I think it's highly unlikely that it will not be implemented at some time in the future.  It is working on the segwit test network already.
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:21:43
Just lost all my respect for this guy. What an idiot to post this.  Just backs up my thoughts that Armstrong, Gavin and Mike were all in this together to try and take away control of core.  Luckily this has about zero chance of happening. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:45:29
We have a few people working for Roger Ver who are trying to delay the implementation of an immediate solution that will almost triple the block size.  Suggest your research into Segwit which has been tested for the last year and which will solve this problem.

From what I understand. It's considered that it will take 9-12 months to do a fairly safe hard fork.  Are you okay to wait that long or do you feel 3-4 weeks for SegWit right now would be better?

I see a lot of this where trolls pretend to be civil and polite.  They sometimes even go the other way and praise core ... but then ... comes the trolling from them and they show their true self towards the end of the posts.

As a block size increase is suggested by you then this sounds very much like a bitcoin classic promotional group posting. FYI more information from your groups lead can be found here:

Obvious to anyone who's not paid to say it's not obvious :-) 
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:50:46
Taking a guess I would say that almost all developers would decide to continue working on BTC.  That's just the way developers are.  Many of them work not for financial reward but for the reward of knowing they did something that could help with the greatest digital money of all time.  
@_date: 2016-01-18 14:55:08
If you look at the agreed plan then you can see core already plan to do block size increases and this was documented after the scaling conference here:
Specifically: 
Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic
block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk
and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals
(such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). **Bitcoin will
be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them.**
Followed by more clarification today:
Core have already said they will do the increases but they want to be sure the risks are understood first. 
I have no idea why people are still going on and on and on and on about Bitcoin Classic. How many times does it have to be said that core already have plans to increase the block size. It's pretty clearly laid out here. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 02:49:12
I think Theymos has done a great job standing up to all the trolls on this board. I'm so tired of hearing the same complaints again and again from people who just want to promote their own self interests and go against the good work that the majority of the core guys are involved in. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 14:26:35
I think it's bad for bitcoin as the news media quote him and his title and people wrongly assume he's the guy in charge and the one who knows best.  When I first heard about bitcoin that's what I actually thought myself.  
There are a lot of very good people working on bitcoin and Gavin with his own version is one of the few people who I feel has caused more damage than anyone else to the reputation of bitcoin over the last 6 months.  Just my opinion and I'm not getting paid for saying that :-) 
@_date: 2017-03-12 16:25:10
Go back in time, post the same thing on reddit and see how many people agree with you :-) 
@_date: 2016-01-17 13:25:58

@_date: 2016-01-18 15:25:35
They can't really rescale to 1 when it is already 1 so I think it is reasonable to assume it's 2,4 and 8.
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:20:54
Yeah right and I suppose you have all of the stats needed to prove that :-) 
@_date: 2016-03-05 05:38:53
Very good work. This could be a game changer for bitcoin. If this proposal is accepted how long do you feel it would be before we could first see it in use? 
@_date: 2016-01-22 04:54:10
Are you more of an expert than the Onetime Team?
"I’m surprised by how big an issue the blocksize debate has become when the current bandwidth is clearly not throttling down usage in any significant way. We, at Onename, were sending 50–100 blockchain ID transactions per block last week (~9,000 total) and didn’t hit bandwidth limits or spike fees.
Yes, everyone would like to see more bandwidth in the future but things are not falling apart today. A reckless increase in blocksize can expose security and reliability issues or disconnect nodes with slower connections. Increasing bandwidth without proper testing and data collection from real networks risks security and reliability which is a bad tradeoff to make."

Every month there's a new Layer 2 scaling solution that I hear about.  Do you ever consider that some of these might actually work or would you prefer a blockchain where 1 million coffee cup purchases are recorded and that is so big that only data centers can hold it?

This is not really the right forum for this kind of posting. Best to try a local newspaper :-) 
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:23:30
I agree with all you say about SegWit significantly increasing the block size.  But just thinking sometimes it's a good idea to agree on something that's not perfect like planning a HF for the sake of world peace. Remember that the original proposal was for SegWit followed by a HF.  If at least planning started for the HF that would not be far from what core were originally suggesting. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:34:22

Can you explain here and hopefully in github the background and benefits. Very good work but really hope you can add some more words around it to explain as much as possible.

The promoters of bigger and bigger block sizes seem completely unable to grasp this simple concept. Which led me a while back to believe they are either completely dumb or they wish to destroy bitcoin.  
In the end my thinking is this whole block size needs to be increase asap emergency issue is basically an attempt to destroy and screw up bitcoin. Looks like they have failed so far but I'm sure they will be back with more issues to try and break bitcoin.

Luckily with the exception of a small number of people I think anyone with any technical knowledge of the situation is very much aware of what is happening.

I listened to this podcast and I am now even more excited about the future of bitcoin today. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 10:53:23
I agree 100% that there is no fire. In fact things are looking very good for bitcoin in 2016. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 07:20:38
Prices moves up and down all the time.  Right now I think Bitcoin has less issues than any time in the last six months.  I just purchased a few minutes ago at $399 on Coinbase as I think it's a good time to buy. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 08:57:47
Ver well said !
@_date: 2017-03-05 21:30:44
A one time increase that adds many other benefits and enables layer 2.  So what's your reason for not wanting it again ? 
@_date: 2016-01-20 17:45:15
That's correct. It is dead just like the last 90 times it also died: 
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:55:14
The core guys have signed up to Greg's plan already. 
I do agree the plan is not as nicely formatted as Mike's rant but the core guys do seem to have come to an agreement and development seems to be progressing very well indeed. 
Check out this link for a vision of what's to come
@_date: 2017-03-04 18:03:30
Yeah.  Roger and his guys are holding up the introduction of segwit which will solve your problem. Sorry about that but you need to message your boss and tell him to support Segwit. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:47:52
You my friend are a great example of a person who is trying to destroy bitcoin. Good luck with your alt coin investments 
@_date: 2017-03-03 18:36:23
I highly doubt it.  Sounds like the daily no confirmation FUD message. Even more so as you have provided no information at all about the transaction.  As you appear to know the rate then it would appear you are the sender and you are also the receiver. So ... why are you worried.  Either it is in your new wallet or in your old wallet.  
@_date: 2016-01-20 14:26:49
Can you let me know if there are vacancies in your group and how much the posting of bitcoin classic promotional posts pays? I would love to earn some cash for reddit posting.

Good to hear there is some competition for OB.  I got tired of hearing Sanchez knocking the core devs and showing his support for BU.
@_date: 2016-03-05 05:14:44
It would appear they want to take over control of Bitcoin with Gavin as the lead developer.  I think it's unlikely but that's certainly what they appear to want to do. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 16:43:38
These Bitcoin Classic promoters are starting to get a bit annoying.  Could you please just take a break and let the real core developers get on with their work for all of our sakes. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 11:19:29
If Mike is living in America there are probably quite a few attorney's that would jump at the opportunity to initiate a law suit against a guy who pretty much by himself caused over 100,000 people to lose a total of around $1,500,000,000.  As far as insider trading well yeah Mike already admitted to selling his bitcoins prior to his timed announcement.  
@_date: 2016-01-19 19:38:57
Here we go again. Another doom and gloom report funded by some entity with a financial interest that does not quite line up with what's in the current plans for bitcoin. I love this comment:
"Finally, the biggie.  Does the Lightning Network exist in usable form today?  NO"
Well yeah, we all know it does not exist because it is in development and first code was only recently released for test/review.  Does the guy not know that you have to develop something before you can use it? 
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:45:10
Is that like with the XT fork where the miners did not vote for one single XT block out of the last 1,000?

For all those who think it is dead then maybe they should listen to this:
@_date: 2017-03-04 07:44:42
Don't complain here.  Message Roger Ver and the BU guys who are holding back SegWit. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 15:33:03
I think they will continue doing posts on reddit and maybe keep busy with some side jobs, interviews and blog posts.  None of the developers for classic have any recent coding experience with bitcoin at all. Gavin gets pretty much ignored these days, Jeff lost his job at bitty and I have no idea who the others are. Are we going to trust the future of digital currency to 5 guys who don't code?
Check this out. Core already agreed to scaling a month ago. I added links in other posts and will add same here. 
If you look at the scaling then you can see core already plan to do block size increases and this was documented after the scaling conference here:
Specifically: 
Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic
block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk
and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals
(such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). **Bitcoin will
be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them.**
@_date: 2016-03-02 08:33:58
Always some who manage to include the same boring complaints about Bitcoin in every post. For those people I suggest paypal might be a good alternative. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:49:35
Andrew is I think they main dev.  Not sure if the others contribute much other than having their name listed there. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 07:58:45
That's great. I hope you're pushing for the SegWit block size increase and not just one of those FUD posters who says all our problems will be solved by Roger and his two BU devs who hope to take over the work of hundreds of others.
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:46:36
Coming from a guy who claims to be (have been) an r/btc moderator I am surprised by this twitter statement.

Getting my bank to do an international transfer took 6 weeks and cost me around $100 plus all the fees.  Don't bother to ask why it took so long, its a long story to tell.  It will be interesting to see how many decades it takes for R3 and the banks to implement blockchain.  I've a feeling Mike will soon get bored with his new job far away from the good developers he left behind. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 18:15:06
They have a lot of money.  Perhaps they can find more devs who need cash.  Even a dev who has almost no involvement could be called "one of the leading devs".  We saw that when that's what they called Mike.
@_date: 2016-01-20 18:02:13
Thanks for posting. More information on the alternative can be found here. I find it's very educational
 
@_date: 2017-03-23 05:42:18
Ryan's an odd character.  His business depends on bitcoin but he shows no thanks to all the hard working core developers who make his business possible. Hard to respect guys like this and even harder when he comes out with dumb statements about BU not being dangerous in light of all the recent events. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 17:22:31
Very good news to see the industry consolidating.  I hope they can introduce some new products to the market.
@_date: 2016-01-21 14:34:41
This is going to upset the large number of trolls that continuously post about what to do after the next fork.

99 doctors in a hospital agree on what's needed to keep you alive but 1 who knows the hospital director has a different opinion and he is able to hold up your life saving operation for months and months.  
You okay with that, do you think it's fair? 
@_date: 2017-03-12 14:24:48
He's too busy pushing for big blocks.  Have you forgotten all the problems and non stop headaches he caused for many developers over this last two years.  He completely lost respect of many developers and has done nothing to gain it back. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 14:04:35
Blockstream was formed by core devs.  It's not a big company that came and bought them all out like R3 bought Mike. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 15:26:42
@_date: 2017-03-12 14:45:54
I am pretty sure I speak for many.  You must have forgotten what people were saying about him 24-12 months ago.  He pissed off more devs than I knew existed. Oh and don't forget when he was dumb enough to announce to the world that Craig White was Satoshi and then in the face of overwhelming evidence it took him a very very long time to say he was wrong.
@_date: 2016-03-01 10:40:01
I see you have posts on the r/btc asking for people to help with support for Bitcoin Classic.  Just wondering if that has anything to do with your post here on the r/bitcoin forum?

Another death of bitcoin to add to the obituary.  You can only say bitcoin is dying so many times before people stop taking you seriously.

Sounds like you're hoping for a price drop so you can buy some coins :-)  
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:34:53
Ryan is not neutral.  He has been pushing for big blocks for months as he has no interest in bitcoin being decentralized and is just looking for fees to be as cheap as possible for the benefit of his application :-(  Sad that's he's on the one hand trying to make a useful application and on the other hand he is very much a big blog supporter who belongs on the bottom row of that picture next to Gavin.
@_date: 2016-03-01 11:33:21
All other avenues of getting what they want have been exhausted so now they try a new way to claim Bitcoin is failing.  What a bunch of ____   The few times in the past when I have looked I see the posters who complain the most I see they are the ones that have promoted alternatives. I see a few who have been promoting alternatives like Ethereum but not so many. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 20:41:10
Your question seems rather dumb based on the way things are right now. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 06:05:13
Yeah I really find it funny when the biggest con artist in Bitcoin tries to tell you a whistleblower who decided to come clean is lying when that guy had absolutely nothing to gain and a lot to lose by speaking out like he did.

Mike Hearn's first commit (5e650d6d2dbfc284c300668e71188e663d8f0a45) to Bitcoin went badly wrong and caused a hard fork. Not sure about the other hard fork.

If it's not a failure you can bet that they will try there best to make it fail.  Just look around at what you can see in the press and a lot of these trolling posts that are appearing here.  Doesn't take much to sit a few employees down in an office and tell them to do there best to post rubbish on the reddit thread and come out with a few articles a week about how everyone is in conflict here and how nothing is working.

My last transfer took 6 weeks and cost over $100.  First was a two week wait to get from one country to another where I could get a notarized copy of my passport.  Notary charged $30. Then Fedex to my bank in UK and then weeks of waiting and follow up emails.  Finally I got pissed off, started to sound a bit more pissed off in my emails and got the email bank saying the transfer had been initiated.  4 days later I got the money in my US account at a bad exchange rate.

I wonder if you have been keeping up with the technology for the last few years.

@_date: 2017-03-26 14:05:43
Absolutely amazing.  Thanks.  Here is the full text of that quote from the link you sent: 
“If scaling bitcoin quickly means there is a risk of [Bitcoin] becoming Paypal 2.0, I think that risk is worth taking because we will always be able to make a Bitcoin 3.0 that [. . .] has the properties that we want. But I think we only have one really good shot at having bitcoin become the default platform for people to transact on across the world. We need to make sure we scale fast enough to allow these new people come onto Bitcoin, even if it means risking some decentralization or risking it becoming, like I said, Paypal 2.0”

I am waiting for the time when the world finds out it can earn bitcoins by browsing web pages. No matter how small the payout the idea of earning something for doing nothing other than looking at a web page is going to be very attractive for a few billion people in the the less developed countries.

@_date: 2016-06-23 10:30:00
You sounds like one of the Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin XT, Ethereum promoting, sky is falling unless the block size is increased crowd.  That was the same crowd that said bitcoin would fall apart as early as last November. Perhaps the reason core is not as obsessed with it as this bunch of people is because they feel it is less of an issue.  Personally when it comes to core devs and miners vs "reddit experts" vs bitcoin disrupters,  I'm pretty sure I know who I'd put my trust into and I'm very pleased with everything that core has been doing.  
@_date: 2016-06-29 09:31:43
Oh that's funny. So you think we should just "try" without doing a thorough investigation and based on what "redditors" think.  This isn't Ethereum you know.

They are voting to change the thing that should never be changed.  No better than what the banks are doing and once they have done it once then I assume they'll do it again and again :-(  Gives crypto a bad image if people associate this with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-06-26 12:02:52
Excuse me.  Did you read anything where I said I pushed or convinced any of my friends into buying.  I have more sense but you appear to not have the sense to even read my post :-(  As far as being at the top of a bubble well if you think that you're welcome to sell.  I personally won't sell for a very long time.

So let me get it right. You are saying it's madness to support these guys because they are not doing enough!
Do you still think Core are doing nothing. Here's a snapshot but perhaps if you look into it you will find there's 100 times more work going on in the background by hundreds of other developers both on their own and in companies:

Hi Gavin, I'm sorry to say this but I think you may not really be welcome here. Have you considered posting your views on r/btc where there are many highly skilled bitcoin experts who I think you would find a lot more receptive to your constructive comments.
@_date: 2016-06-13 10:21:19
If they keep delaying then those people who realize they are doing this might end up moving to other mining pools. If you support a group who tried to disrupt bitcoin then why would people use your pool?

I thought her org sounded like a scam after checking the web site.  Heck maybe we should all start one of these orgs and try to get companies to donate :-)  No wonder she hopes to stop that interview as it exposes her for what she really is.

A lot of all this is due to the work that you and the other core devs are doing. Thanks very much for all your hard work and support. You have the respect of many thousands of people and you're working on a technology that could change the financial world.  Thanks!

Tell him you're having a great month after your bitcoin holdings went up in value over 100%.  Money talks.  I have mentioned bitcoin to my four of my  friends but never pushed them or suggested to buy.   2 of my friends have purchased now and another is asking where he can purchase while another said he wants to buy as soon as he gets funds. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 08:23:04

Both Mike and Gavin failed in their efforts to disrupt bitcoin.  I think their bosses will be pretty pissed off with him. From the way Gavin has acted I'm sure he will try again to see what he can do to disrupt the currency and cause as much damage as possible.

Would be great if you could give up posting this rubbish in a different form every 3-4 days.  I realize you spend a lot of time composing these posts but most here are I think by now tired of the "we need big blocks or the system will fall apart postings" and the "I have now changed my stance on the block-size debate" posts you and other trolls keep trying to post here. It would be much more constructive if you could talk about the amount of zero to low fee transactions that are being used to fill up blocks to make them appear full than posting this rubbish. Thank you. 
@_date: 2016-06-04 05:48:18
You sound like "no expert" so I think you should probably try not to predict things and stop posting rubbish like this and stop the follow up posts that you'll post on this thread from different user names. You're just wasting everyone's time.

Sounds like you know absolutely nothing about what is going on and all the good work core are doing.  Making changes to a 10 billion dollar currency is not like painting a house. It's done with care and planning and takes time to get right. I for one hope that core take their time to ensure every last thing is checked before releasing any change. If you prefer a fast changing, untested alternative the there are many out there.  
@_date: 2016-06-26 02:24:43

Are you more of an expert than the Onetime Team?
"I’m surprised by how big an issue the blocksize debate has become when the current bandwidth is clearly not throttling down usage in any significant way. We, at Onename, were sending 50–100 blockchain ID transactions per block last week (~9,000 total) and didn’t hit bandwidth limits or spike fees.
Yes, everyone would like to see more bandwidth in the future but things are not falling apart today. A reckless increase in blocksize can expose security and reliability issues or disconnect nodes with slower connections. Increasing bandwidth without proper testing and data collection from real networks risks security and reliability which is a bad tradeoff to make."
@_date: 2016-01-10 13:42:12

If there was something wrong with the rc then that's why they have an rc, to give people a chance to find out if there is something wrong. What was the problem that you were concerned with and was this fixed?
@_date: 2017-01-23 19:11:48
The source is in the link where the BU Chief Scientist comes out and says it's not particularly important.  Can't get much more clear than that.  So good luck with BU, unlimited it seems applies to the number of coins as well as any number of other params they want to play with. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 11:56:27
In a 3 or 6 month context it's all hugely positive but by picking the window you did you falsely suggested there was a problem with the price trend right now.  Totally worthless post and chart.

Yeah, Sanchez reminds me of Roger Ver when it comes to his views about core, the blocksize debate, hard forking and SegWit adoption.  He has a short term view of what's needed and what would be best for his company rather than a long term view of what would best help bitcoin. Sad to have people in the industry who are more focused on their own gains than the gains of millions. Wondering if there's something / some deals going on between him and Roger. Right now he's busy promoting Teechan which is not even a product as an alternative to SegWit so go figure !
@_date: 2017-01-23 18:22:37
Do you doubt the word of the BU chief scientist?
@_date: 2017-01-26 17:16:56
100% correct. It was always from the start created to spread Bitcoin FUD and help the growth of the other 900+ alternative coins.  When you're an alt coin dev you need things like r/btc to help spread the FUD to keep people interested in alts.

I just went to a recipient bank to ask about an international wire transfer.  I've been trying to find out how to do this for hours now and nobody is giving me clear instructions. The recipient bank is saying my address must appear on the transfer information. The sending bank is saying no. The recipient bank is saying I can try but then if it fails they will need to write to the sending bank and it may take 1-2 weeks as the banks are usually slow to reply. But they say try it anyway and if you don't hear from us after a few days then come in and we'll try and sort it out.  I had same problem a few years ago and it took around 2 weeks to resolve.  Oh and the sending bank cannot send until they receive a notarized copy of my passport with written instructions which I will need to Fedex to them so that adds another few days and $40. Plus I can no longer find out where to Fedex to so I have just emailed my bank to ask them. Well that will be another day at least. Plus then of course I need everything printed, copy of passport bio page notarized. I don't have a printer but then I can go to an internet cafe to get them to print out what's needed but then they'll have all my bank info if they print that doc. I could go on for another 20 lines but hope you get the picture. Same process with BTC would take around 3-4 minutes and most of that would be time to start up my computer and login.

So the merging of segwit is not a scaling solution, so the upcoming 2nd layer networks are not scaling solutions?  Would you prefer a blockchain that recorded a billion cup of coffee purchases but that's so big that only a few nodes can hold it.  I get very confused when people think the only solution to scaling is to make something bigger and can't consider other ways to scale.

Agree it's overpriced but for a company with a loaded labor rate of more than $100 an hour for an employee the price is less than the coffee budget.

Does it matter? I can't see your point.  So some transactions possibly go through faster than others. It's not a race.  Getting back to my comparison of cars on the highway.  There's always someone who wants to go faster and if so then good for them.  For fast transactions I suppose people can use Ethereum or alt coins if they are okay with censorship and nobody actually accepting payment for anything. I'm happy with btc and I leave Ethereum to the speculators and the get rich quick crowd.

There soon may be a lot of bank blockchain developers looking for new opportunities as soon as the banks realize private blockchains are no different from replicated SQL databases with auditing switched on. 
@_date: 2017-01-30 12:21:51
Thanks for your comments.  Right now it's my feeling that pretty much every use case is handled now with SQL databases that have been perfected over the last 30-40 years. Database technologies have been move forward so much but unless you work as a database administrator you're probably not aware of just what can be done these days. Local replication, seriously strong auditing and so many other features have been around now for 15 years and that's the reason I think no company is going to seriously use blockchain for anything either now or in the future.  It has one very very good use case and that is the case of digital currency. Nothing can replicate what it offers for currency.

Thanks for reply. Would be nice to hear from Washington but not sure if he bothers with reddit. He seems to prefer twitter.  Here's a quote from another poster in this thread which kind of sums up what I thought when reading Washington's posts. 
"Washington Sanchez is a vocal big block / BU supporter and is happy to shit on Bitcoin Core when ever he has that opportunity."
It was Washington's very critical twitter posts which really prompted me to post here and not so much your posts as I did see you have a much more balanced view. The way I look at it with Washington posting the way he does it does not reflect well on OpenBazaar and in turn on you as for many people you are a very important part of OpenBazaar.

There is no victory, it's just common sense that there's more to scaling than changing a number from 1 to 2 or 20 (as Gavin suggested).

I bought so I guess you are wrong. Bought yesterday also. By the way SegWit is not currently blocked by anyone.  Perhaps later but to say something is blocked before even voting has started is a bit premature. Regarding ETF, do you think that's the only way to obtain bitcoins :-) ?

That's fine as long as they are good at playing catch up. Which would you rather sign up for as a new user.  A wallet that had SegWit capabilities or one that said they will get around to it sometime in the future.

I don't think this is new news.  If you follow the IRC you will see it come up sometimes.  It's just that these days people have more sense than to go making announcements every week as every time an announcement is made then the r/btc trolls get hold of it and do their best to put it down. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 15:30:22

I am guessing the chat logs will be posted soon so let's see if the guy really is lying with his comments about no devs being invited. My personal feeling is that if he was concerned then he could have easily upfront said that he would like to postpone the chat until he had his devs there also. 
@_date: 2016-12-15 04:04:08
Roger acts like a spoiled child who is not getting enough attention. He uses his money to pay people to support him and does nothing more than hinder progress.  So sad to have this kind of person involved with an open source project that has so many dedicated developers who in many cases offer their services for free.

That's not what others are saying "btcd with BU port - yuck".   I doubt anyone will want to buy that product unless they make it pretty clear that the buyers are not going to be supporting BU and that they'll have 0.13.1 SegWit ready
@_date: 2016-12-23 12:57:22
You may be right or wrong but I don't think anyone of us knows for sure. So dollar cost average and by a small set amount each week. Suggesting that now is not the right to buy even a small amount is not good advice at all. Years ago I bought a house when the prices were up.  My friends said it was too expensive and they would wait.  Price doubled in a year and my friends still had not bought.  There was no house price correction and those friends missed out big time.

@_date: 2016-12-04 08:37:22
Search back in the history and you will find some answers. The developers have more sense than to make weekly announcements as they know that every time they do this the r/btc trolls get hold and try to find fault in what they have just said.

"Software managers tackle far more complex problems every day" - Do those complex problems involve many billions of dollars and a digital currency that has the potential to change the world?  Seems strange to me that anyone would try to rush something rather than carefully test it out.

Gavin could have been the Tim Berners-Lee of Bitcoin after Satoshi disappeared but my feeling is he ended up as the Forest Gump of Bitcoin. I think it very sad that a person who knows so much about Bitcoin chose to head off in a direction that conflicted with the views of so many people instead of working with the developers and contributing. I wish Gavin could go back to working with the core developers and stop working against everything they are trying to do.

Agreed but with their continual attempts to push through a hard fork even when it's obvious there is risk by doing it quickly it has seemed like they want us to get to the point where the forks might potentially cause a split. Thankfully it looks like all their attempts to promote something "quick, dirty and untested" have failed.

What wallet are you using.  I have never experienced a single problem where there has been any delay that I even noticed in the last 18 months. I am not saying that some transactions might have taken 20 mins instead of less than 10 but I've never noticed any not confirmed after I checked back later.  Samourai wallet will have the option to bump up fees and also child pays for parent.  Soon if the other wallets adopt this then problems like this where people initially pay too low a fee will end.

"he wants" &lt; Oh that's nice.  What about the millions of users and 100s of other developers who have contributed to core plus all the other miners.  Don't they count or is it just Jihan who thinks he can get what "he wants"?

Good to see this new release.  Just some suggestions for your web site:
- Maybe it would be good if you could simplify the install page. Perhaps a button for each of the operating systems which would then show the instructions below after the button was clicked.  Just looking at it from a UI point of view.  Good to keep things as simple as possible.
- When I click documentation it takes me to a page saying: The documentation is hosted on docs.electrum.org.  Would it not be better just to change the top menu link to post straight there?
@_date: 2017-04-13 14:47:19
I find it funny that they are so pissed off with the bitcoin core developer and yet 99.5% of the code they run was developed by the bitcoin core developers and they appear to support nothing more than a highly centralized solution which favors miners making as much money as possible. It's almost like those trolls are being funded to post this rubbish :-) 
@_date: 2016-02-26 14:15:44
They are pessimistic about everything except things they want for themselves.

Emin has no interest in the success of bitcoin but if you say that to him then he'll try to list all the "wonderful" things he has done for bitcoin.  He's as much of a con artist as Roger is.  Saying this based on what I have seen first hand, reading his tweets over the years. 
@_date: 2017-04-21 14:26:39
Please explain why you think it's good for a group of 12 people to decide the future of a crypto.  Is that what you want for bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-04-10 00:44:48
I don't think that's a threat but if I was Jihan I would be concerned as there are hundreds of millions of dollars involved. A long time ago I saw a person who had been killed because he had stolen a car battery.  Things happen and it's never good to make enemies. 
@_date: 2017-04-11 16:43:48
Which item of fake news are you trying to suggest?  We've listened to fake news now from the BU / Roger / Gavin camp that nobody takes them seriously any more.
@_date: 2017-04-15 21:37:45
They have a way to make a lot of additional money without being noticed. Given what we have observed about Jihan if you think he's not used ASICboost then you're out of your mind. 
@_date: 2017-04-12 14:20:59
Emin is nothing more than a troll these days.  He's doing the same thing as Mike, Gavin, Roger and Jihan.  Pumping the BU propaganda machine as much as possible. I have to wonder how much these guys are getting paid.  No respect at all for this guy.  Lowest of the low.

@_date: 2017-04-15 21:32:48

Those full blocks have tripled my net worth since I first started purchasing bitcoin. The fact that fees are higher than before is meaningless to many who are holding btc as digital gold.

As usual he is making a fool of himself again. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 06:24:20
Taking a guess I would say that almost nobody believes what he is saying.  It's become pretty clear that delaying SegWit for as long as possible will increase the profits of miners who are using ASICBOOST. Once that news came out then it became very hard to believe anything coming from bitmain and associated mining pools. 
@_date: 2017-04-11 16:51:19
That there are over 100 regular core contributors and last time I checked 98% of them don't work for Blockstream. So take your silly comments back to r/btc please
@_date: 2016-02-28 14:20:32
That's good to hear.  Much prefer to have a well tested product than have code rushed into production.  As I said before on another post we waited around 4.5 billion years to get this far.  Another few months is not long to wait for an important new feature. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 17:53:18
I agree. Issues get resolved. When I worked at IBM we had thousands of database software issues that were in the process of being resolved. Most DBMS systems still have hundred and hundreds.  If LN did not have issues I'd be very surprised. 
@_date: 2017-04-26 09:02:12
Sorry you're having these issues.  There's a scaling solution (SegWit) ready to be implemented but being held up by a miner and another person who have an interest in keeping things the way they are. Looks like the problems are going to be resolved now the BU (Bitcoin Unlimited) solution is pretty much dead.  Keep your fingers crossed for a quick resolution.

Based on 99% of the bitcoin developers in my Twitter feed who now seem pretty confident it's dead.  Didn't hear much from the 2-3 BU developers lately but I guess they are still on their world tour trying to promote what's left of BU :-)  
@_date: 2016-02-26 14:55:19
If they got control they would not know what to do with it.  They have less than a handful of non active developers.

What I have to wonder is, what exactly has your company come up with in the last 18-24 months.  I had high hopes but so far after 1 1/2 years I've seen nothing other than an email API application. Is your company ever going to come up with anything innovative or is that always six months away? By the way, do you or do you not support SegWit and do you or do you not support BU?  Why exactly don't you have any position on the block size debate.  Please have the guts to form an opinion and don't just sit there trying to keep everyone happy, if you cannot form an opinion then you're as bad as the worst of them and time for you to move on as nobody's going to have any respect for you if you just sit on the sidelines and keep quiet hoping to keep everyone happy.

It's not hard to figure out that if there was a group that's spent the last six months trying take to control, a group that didn't get their own way and who wanted to make Core look bad, then they would probably do exactly what is being done at this time. For all that I know they might even come up with posts on medium to say something like "bitcoin is dead".
@_date: 2016-02-22 07:20:08
When everyone of any importance says "It's dead" then yeah I believe it is dead.  Might not be dead for the reddit posters who never give up but it's about as dead as it can get right now.

ps. Lightning Network, Payment Networks Sidechains are looking good to me for the future.

Just because you have a fast connection does not change the latency and time it takes for blocks to propagate around the world so no it's not really relevant. For further details and FUD please return to r/btc and ask the "expert" Roger Ver.

Only a guy as dumb as Roger could think up the idea to replace over 100 dedicated core developers with four new guys who just took the work of 100s, made a copy of it and changed a few lines.

Prominent people have not been going around causing all the upset that Gavin has.  Him and a few assorted others have caused a lot of headaches for many over the last 6-12 months. The guys that have been doing the real work have been quietly doing it in the background.

@_date: 2016-05-25 08:56:25
Anyone have any updates on the progress of side chains? Is the continued work waiting on new features to be added to the bitcoin protocol?
@_date: 2016-05-05 19:47:54
Next couple of months?  From what I recall people on reddit were coming to that conclusion about 60 minutes after the announcement.

Seems reasonable. It can always be added later once he confirms the validity of his post.

If I want to transfer $500 to a friend around the world and the fee is 5 or 10 cents do you really think that matters?  Stop wasting all our time as we all know people don't give up on bitcoin because of frustration of waiting because they need to pay a 4,5 or 6 cent fee. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:19:46
Confirming what I thought 9 months ago the very first time I heard Gavin talking about block size and saying he wanted to have an agreed upon growth path for the next 20 years.  Really I think the guys lost his m__d and he would better serve bitcoin by choosing a different hobby. 
@_date: 2016-05-07 07:43:59
The world has moved on since Satoshi's vision and people have come to realize that 1 billion cup of coffee transactions might not fit on the blockchain.  If you want to stick with the past dreams then go ahead but we've all moved on now. Just out of interest which other cryptocurrency do you feel is the best alternative to Bitcoin? By the way I think your statement "it's causing visible angst" is overblown. I don't see the community here getting particularly upset about it. 
@_date: 2016-05-12 09:44:52
Except blockchain and driverless cars are here now and quantum computing is still very far in the future (unless your a D-Wave salesperson).

A quick check of the Slack and IRC channels shows that developers are really busy right now.  Yet the message being put out by some is that they are not doing anything. What's the motive behind the continual need to say that bitcoin progress is slow.  Are these people working for big time investors in alts such as Ether?
@_date: 2016-05-28 11:39:42
@_date: 2016-05-17 16:23:37
I've not noticed any change in price since the spams (if you want to call them that) restarted. What change did you notice? Just pay the correct fee and you'll have no problem at all but if you're part of the people doing the spamming (if you want to call it that) then they may experience delays with their spam.

- Todd - doing great work for core - no commit access
- Greg - doing great work for core - no commit access
- Luke - doing great work for core - no commit access
- 100's of others doing great work for core - no commit access
- Gavin - Causing nothing but problems for core - certainly does not need commit access. He has I assume commit access for Bitcoin Classic so why would he need commit access to core? Is he going to start giving out commit access to Classic to all the core devs?

Gavin is doing himself no favor by keeping quiet at this time.  Makes him look even more foolish and less competent than before (last 12 months) and that takes some doing :-(  WTF happened to Gavin.  He used to be a huge contributor to bitcoin up until the time about a year ago that he started to undo all of the trust, respect and good work that he did.  Now his reputation is somewhere down the toilet.

Of course it's priced in already.  Just the same way as the cost of any investment is priced in.  So what's your point?  My house has the dollar amount priced in but if they were to suddenly reduce the number of new houses being built by 50% do you think the price of my house would go down.

Yeah we need those 1 exabyte (a unit of information equal to one quintillion (1018) bytes, or one billion gigabytes) blocks.  Help us Roger I know you can do it.  You just need to use your dollars for a bit more troll marketing.

I wonder what r/btc will have to say about this.  Will they agree with Roger and say fees are too dam low?
@_date: 2016-05-05 15:31:14
A foundation of two people with the one calling himself the Chief Scientist. Hopefully one day these guys will realize how stupid the whole thing is and go off and join R3 leaving the hard working supporters of bitcoin to get on with the good work they have been doing. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 08:24:08

Roger needs to do us all a favor and disappear in the same way that Gavin and Mike did.

@_date: 2016-05-09 08:57:24
Classic has just 5% of hash power and from what I understand most of that is because the mining pools split the vote for which to support 50:50 for the people who don't care.  So in reality perhaps Classic has less than 1% support.  Given that then why are people even still talking about it?  
@_date: 2016-05-03 11:03:22
I have found Gavin's behavior for the last year disturbing and outrageous. Leaving commit access to a person who borders on incompetent is probably not a good idea for any important project. Would you trust Gavin with the keys to a multi-billion dollar project after all he's done this last 12 months?

Now that the big block guys are not able to tell us the world will fall apart at the time of the halving if we don't have big blocks today they are simply trying the usual never ending FUD.  I notice these guys never say anything about new payment channels, LN or anything they just hope that people here will fixate on the Satoshi vision of years ago.  No thought is given to the fact that things might have changed and a few hundreds of people might have come up with better solutions.

Either way BCC or BCH, if you dump all in one go you just gave the chain analysis companies a birthday present.  Maybe that's the true intent.  To have all BTC users reveal every one of their addresses.  Possibly that could be more use to governments than any BCC or BCH tiny alt coin.

I don't see it matters as Fred the co-founder of Coinbase has already stated this about Ethereum:
"Ethereum has a serious security issue as it is (correctly so) in move fast and break things mode which is unrecoverable"

The guy has recently been posting some positive stuff about Ethereum but he still loves to come back and post his stupid ideas about bitcoin every so often. In some ways he reminds me of a person that's a cross between Gavin and Hearne.  Basically his end game seem to be to disrupt bitcoin as much as possible.

I actually think most ignore him.  He's got about as much credibility as Gavin and Mike Hearn.  The guys become somewhat of an idiot lately.  Guess that's what power does to you.  You start to think you know everything even when you know nothing.
@_date: 2016-07-25 09:42:03
Gavin's commenting non-stop.  Yesterday he was trying to suggest that LN would not work as it depends on sender and receiver node being connected all the time.  He completely missed that the expectation is other always on nodes are planned for LN.  Not sure if he's no idea or if he's just trying to spread FUD.  Probably not explaining that very well but the IRC groups were talking about it and wondering why Gavin's spreading false info.

They're possible and 100% working now.  But enforcing them, ensuring there are no bugs and managing them might be the biggest problem of all.  I don't see a good future for the Ethereum blockchain but I think there may be a future for such products as Rootstock and Counterparty Smart contracts as they could be backed by a reliable currency running in some kinds of much smaller side chains.

Sounds like more FUD by the big block Classic, Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Unlimited guys to push the same agenda they have been trying to push for over the last year.  For some reason they always forget to mention the large number of dust transactions with very low fees that are used to fill blocks.

"i had to reindex because as usual bitcoin core derped out and failed to start with idiotic bugs..."
Perhaps it would be a help if you provided feedback on the idiotic bugs. I have no idea of the answer to your problem but so that others can help, some more information on the type of computer, speed etc may be of use so that people will take you seriously and spend their time answering you.

"The push for a raw 2MB increase without the mitigating improvements by a couple people (and basically no active developers) is bizarre in the extreme, and leaves even me wondering if the push isn't explicitly malicious rather than simply ignorant."
For some of the posters here I do think it's malicious (most likely they are alt coins supporters). A small number are simply ignorant and the rest of the crowd are ones who feel there's a financial gain for their business by having blocks as large as possible. I think the number of people who want big blocks to improve bitcoin is close to zero. Must be frustrating to have to deal with these people all the time.

Cutoff time is usually 4pm each business day.  Transactions are normally posted at midnight but there may be significant delays if your transaction is over $3,000.

Good to hear that I am not the only one that noticed these posts popping up every day now.  I notice the writing style of most of them is very similar to what we used to see before.

Great to hear he has such an interest. I cannot wait to see the data and look at the research studies that have been published by his team to back all of this up.  All that detailed and well laid out data will I am sure be a help to everyone.  Has this data been made available so that it can be viewed by everyone and verified? As far as the statement 
"He showed me specific transactions with over $5 fees that took hours to confirm and told me about other transactions with higher fees and the same problem."
It means nothing else backed up with solid data and in a report that everyone can see.  I'm not really into believing when people use words like "he showed me"  ...

I have Japanese friends who seem more and more interested in bitcoin these days. One bought a few weeks ago (not such a good time) another planning to buy after he has funds next month.

Andreas - for once in your life maybe you should say what you really think and not give the sanitized version.  Gavin and Jon were fooled, we know it, they know it.  But did they have the guts to tell this to the media?  No they just keep quiet. 
Do you not for one minute think they should come out and tell the media what they now think in the same way that they originally told the media about how they thought Craig was Satoshi? 
If the answer is "no" then fine but if the answer is "yes" then why don't you have the guts to say that in your tweet.  Getting tired of hearing the "we should all be friends" routine.

I think we can move on when Gavin stops spreading FUD.  It's been perhaps 12 hours since his last attempt to suggest LN won't work.  He's either very well paid to spread FUD or he's an idiot. I am sure he must know what he is saying sometimes is a load of rubbish.

Nothing more than a bunch of dumb trolls trying to disrupt bitcoin.  I am guessing most of them are ethereum guys,  classic guys or sad soles who are hoping to push down the price of btc. Wait a while and they'll move on to some new topic and try to blame block stream or core devs for the next stupid thing they come up with.  Last time I checked was a couple of months ago.

I think POS would be okay for Ethereum as Fred Ehrsam (cofounder of coinbase) has already made clear his views in his recent AMA:
"Ethereum has a serious security issue as it is (correctly so) in move fast and break things mode which is unrecoverable"
"I am OK with this risk though: don't put in more money than you are willing to lose, and whatever the issue is can likely be resolved, new version of the network spins up a month or two later."
If it's seen to work out then perhaps bitcoin core could consider it in the next 5-10 years.

@_date: 2016-07-12 10:52:01
And some great bullshit :-)  
@_date: 2016-07-18 23:19:54
Sorry to say this but I feel your comments regarding block size are foolish FUD and I am sure you are well aware of it.  Have a nice day.
@_date: 2016-07-02 19:28:00
They've been asking this for at least the last six months.  Maybe this time your transaction is a bit higher than your usual one. 
@_date: 2016-07-24 02:34:54
Because trolls will troll and by now after a year of it I think almost everyone just ignores them here.  Nobody has the time for the rubbish they keep posting. 
@_date: 2016-07-25 16:40:45
You're back again.  Is there anything positive you can find about anything.  You were just there on the other post saying the same thing about another investment that involved bitcoin.  I realize everyone should by btc and hoard as I do but having a wallet to keep stuff in is not for everyone. 
@_date: 2016-07-29 07:53:55
You lost all credibility when I looked and found your comment history including this recent comment:  "Particularly "It's a little pathetic that no one sees that Bitcoin is definitely being manipulated by the company block stream." -

Are you by any chance working with Amanda on this:

Try sending a big parcel in the US with 1/3 of the normal postage and see what happens.  Have a nice day
@_date: 2016-07-22 05:53:45
I gave up after I saw the picture of the fork.  A crypto forks, funds that belong to one person are moved to others who lost funds through a foolish investment.  They call that a success. Could this be something to add to the bitcoin obituary site? 
@_date: 2016-07-17 14:51:59
I am also interested to know what it could be used for if anyone could come up with some examples. 
@_date: 2016-07-12 12:07:04
Checkout the Bitcoin Unlimited podcast where they talk with one of the people promoting Onecoin.  
@_date: 2016-07-21 17:25:08
Give them a break and upgrade rather than complain!
@_date: 2016-07-23 16:34:22
None of us here like to hear opinions of fools and trolls.  The r/btc forum is for that. 
@_date: 2016-07-15 05:23:08
It would be even more excellent if the FUD guys had not joined the conversations to spread a load of rubbish about Blockstream.  
@_date: 2016-07-28 11:50:18
The only people concerned about Block Size appear to be those who can benefit financially from bigger blocks or those who do not stand to benefit from the growth of bitcoin.  The vast majority of developers who work with bitcoin code every day do not appear to think any block size increase is needed right now.
@_date: 2016-07-25 07:18:34
He is saying each of btc and ether have their uses.  He acknowledges that the best use of ether may not be something to do with money where there is a chance of litigation. Check out the latest Let's Talk Bitcoin and here what he has to say. 
@_date: 2016-07-15 16:56:17
Why don't you step up and contribute instead of complaining about Core.  I'm sure you'd do a great job.  Hey maybe you can replace Greg as one of the most knowledgeable developers out there.  Have a nice day. 
@_date: 2016-07-19 05:04:08
oh dear,  I'm getting down voted for telling the truth :-( 
@_date: 2016-07-23 14:38:11
They invest in it because of great marketing :-) 
@_date: 2016-07-29 14:11:20
Brian reminds me of a number of other posters here who are like children who sit there crying if they don't get there way. 
@_date: 2016-07-15 02:41:39
It talks about bitcoin and the halving and then tries to push people into buying Ethereum in a ponzi like presentation. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 06:05:41
Did anyone els noticed all your previous posts have been in the Ethereum forum.  
@_date: 2016-07-26 08:52:32
The problem is the kids are either getting paid to argue or they are alt coin pumpers. I think very few of the true core developers who do not have an agenda want to see a bigger blocks size right now. Whole things being blown out of proportion in the hope of pushing some of the bitcoin money into other currencies or improving profits for companies that could benefit from a bigger block size.
@_date: 2016-07-02 06:13:13
Old news that's already been disproved with twitter comments from some of the Chinese miners.  Seems like people will publish anything they think will make some news without checking.  Reminds me of the Craig Wright announcement. 
@_date: 2016-07-20 12:26:04
can we see more pics please.  I would like to see pics of some kittens if you have them. Thanks
@_date: 2016-07-16 10:47:26
The sooner we get 2nd level layer solutions in place and these guys shut up the better. Getting really tired of hearing this non stop from people for the most part are writing click bait articles.  When it comes to who knows best "the core devs" or a bunch of journalists my choice will be the devs that live and breath bitcoin every day. 
@_date: 2016-07-05 16:32:28
My bank accounts goes up 0.5% a year while bitcoin has gone up 50% this year and you say "not shooting up"? I am very happy with bitcoins current state and I look forward to future changes being introduced slowly and carefully.

Well I would maybe try but the link to give more info is not working. Was not working yesterday and is not working today.

Can you explain why you seem to be so upset by this companies product?
@_date: 2016-07-20 12:25:26
Yeah the OP sounds like a child crying over the promise of an ice cream. I highly doubt he's been even close to a meeting. A lot of jokers here on this reddit these days :-) 
@_date: 2016-07-11 16:18:55
This guy's posting saying the price will go down all the time. Not such a smart guy as he seems to be unable to spell complicated words like "when" and "money" 
@_date: 2016-07-27 19:16:17
I posted to the r/ethereum for informational purposes. We should all remember to keep each other informed of developments like this. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 00:06:53
Are you talking about Gavin and Mike? As the previous poster said: "Please do not troll our subreddit, we enjoy peaceful lives here in our kingdom"
@_date: 2016-07-25 16:22:16
Can you explain why you seem to be so upset by this companies product?

She's not that hot.  Oh wait I guess everything is relative and depends where you come from :-) 
@_date: 2016-07-07 16:04:56
Yeah I know :-) 
@_date: 2016-07-04 05:32:04
Common sense and new developments changed the timeline. I expect more common sense and new developments in the future so don't expect things to keep to the same plan year after year. 
@_date: 2016-07-12 02:10:52
As the current  doom and gloom it will go DOWN DOWN DOWN poster. I was expecting you to post here.  Like your funny post about someone who committed suicide based on the website.  You come up with all kinds of different bullshit every time :-) Waiting for your next DOWN DOWN DOWN post.  Will you be posting that today for our entertainment? 
@_date: 2016-07-18 22:56:31
How long before we will see the 1st?
@_date: 2016-07-19 15:34:27
Things have changed since 2013-2014 when people used to think the way you did.  Time to check in and see all the new stuff that's happening.  Everyone else learned a lot this last two years so please check out all the new stuff.  You'll find your thinking is so out of date. Have a nice day. 
@_date: 2016-05-18 06:08:48
You both did the hard work. Thanks Peter !
@_date: 2016-07-30 07:54:13
haha keep saying this and maybe you will convince yourself. I prefer to follow the wisdom of the core developers who put in thousands of hours working on bitcoin and who know a heck of a lot more than a bunch of reddit users.  Btw as a redditor for 21 days do you now consider yourself an expert that is able to tell other people "I am not sure what you are talking about".  You certainly learned a lot in 21 days :-)  
@_date: 2016-07-27 15:36:10
I think 89.9% of the 90% of the votes are his own votes so pretty much means nothing other than highlighting his agenda. 
@_date: 2016-07-27 05:28:16
One of these days his investors will realize that Brian has a screw lose and dump the guy.
@_date: 2016-07-25 15:03:47
I thought they got paid to do daily pumps.  Better check up with Gavin, Brian and the others to find out what's happening.  Don't we need the 2Mb hard fork by end of week any more?

What's wrong with you?  Just wondering.  YES I think it would be much better for people to buy btc and hold themselves but for those that don't want to do it then this is better than nothing. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 10:52:37
Reddit people know everything.  Didn't you know that;-) 
@_date: 2016-07-30 08:06:15
Yeah it was all worked out while he was in jail.  Btw when's he going back to jail to pay for the millions of dollars he stole from the people he's now trying to make friends with?

I think most are by the same idiot poster who probably works for coinbase :-)

@_date: 2016-07-19 03:59:33
haha yeah very positive.  Can it be considered a success for your coin to be allowed to be censored.  Not really something you should be proud of and from that point on the coin becomes no better than onecoin. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 05:44:08
You sound like a kid complaining why his mum won't give him the 3rd ice cream of the day.  The kids not able to understand mum might be interested in his health but the kid just sits there crying and can't understand as he sees a lot of other kids with ice creams and he figures they must all be eating ice cream all of the day.

I guess people do anything if they get paid enough but how can these guys stoop so low?  There's a word that comes to mind but I won't mention it here. 
@_date: 2016-07-24 04:46:43
Yeah really.  
@_date: 2016-07-23 12:59:15
I fully agree with these guys when they say they trust Blockstream more than any other company in the industry. I wonder how the Blockstream hating r/btc guys will respond :-)
@_date: 2016-07-24 20:42:47
As far as I remember most of your posts are trolling posts.  Can't be bothered to provide links or spend more than a few seconds answering a troll. 
@_date: 2016-07-19 03:23:03
With all the money the guy has you'd have though he could at least put something toward hiring someone to help with the bitcoin protocol but you're right.  He spends all his time criticizing others who help with an open source project and then reaps the benefits.  In my opinion he's no better than  Mike, Gavin or Carples. Not sure what's up with these guys.  Don't they care what people think about them?
@_date: 2016-07-29 07:49:06
Roger acts like a spoiled kid who didn't get to eat his third ice cream. He needs to grow up and be a big boy instead of crying all the time.
