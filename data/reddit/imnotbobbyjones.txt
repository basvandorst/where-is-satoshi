Taken from this blogger "First, they could show that the U.S. and other major states would not feel threatened by a well-established payment system that they couldn’t control..... I don’t see any very plausible arguments........"
At this very moment, since before you were born in fact, there is a well-established payment system that they already dont control. Besides for positioning one member in the federal reserve, the government has no control over their operations.

the big f*&amp; you that you mention, is when you SPEND your bitcoin and alleviate the need for paper money. Buying (x) amount and holding it is nothing more than buying Gold and saying F*&amp; your paper money... if you arent actively trading your gold with others than its just a speculative investment, your not harming the banks by holding. If you want to change the world, trying converting your money to bitcoin, get paid in bitcoin where you can, and use it as a currency to pay for your life.

whats wrong with downloading the full client, letting it run in the background for a few days? Its not like you have to constantly write code for 48 hours as its syncing...

Bitcoin is borderless? Unless its the border of a country without a central bank.... Bitpays chief compliance officer worked over a decade with the FDIC and Banking industry. These are the people that love legacy, dont be fooled.
