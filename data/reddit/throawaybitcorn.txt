Videos like this make me think that bitcoin needs someone who is better at speaking in front of the camera.
First of all, no one dominated anyone in this video. 
The two major issues that were brought up have easy rebuttals 
1) Hacking bitcoin to create coins
yes it happened before but the blockchain was simply rolled back and the bug was fixed leaving the network stronger than before. Sorry andreas you are wrong and you missed a perfect opportunity to show why bitcoin is strong.
you know what else happened? There was a bug in 2010 that let anyone spend anyone elses coins. 
Read comments and link: 
fixed and moved on. shit happens - bitcoin learns and grows.
2) volatility (flash crash to 100)
Happened on one exchange, someone fucked up a trade and lost tons of money. Sucks for them, but also sucks for andreas and matt for again missing an easy rebuttal against bitcorn professor. Also happened on btc-e which has much less liquidity than bitstamp... people need to realize that bitcoin doesnt have just one exchange... everything is hodge podge 
this doesnt even mention the fact that bitcoin is essentially a STARTUP  filled with the hopes of dreams and nerds around the world who trade on emotion, pitted against savvy daytraders who manipulate them with ease - so of course it is volatile. give it some time lame popcorn guy.

See, I don't mind bitcoin haters. They, along with hacks on the network, are what allow us to grow instead of be complacent. Every attack is a chance to be stronger.. like goku (cmon dbz is the best show ever made).
Anyways, like I said, I don't mind them, but I wish they werent all fucking idiots. Where is the 'smart' bitcoin hater?
