Yes, but think of what you are getting.  You are getting hard money, money that the government can't inflate away from you.  Look at Zimbabwe and Venezuela.  Look at the budget deficit numbers for the US and several other countries.

I'd also like to point out that sending money to Venezuela doesn't actually reduce the number of people starving.  The person that you send money to can buy food, but that just means that someone else can't afford to.
If Venezuela were connected to the world economy then it would be another manner, the money would ultimately be used to import more food.  However, Venezuela has capital controls, which means that money cannot leave the system, therefore it cannot be used to import food.

Antpool is run by Jihan, the leader of the Chinese mining cartel.  He is the main guy behind BCash and was a top guy in the S2X attack.  His miners have a kill switch so he can remotely disable "your" equipment.  By supporting Antpool you support Jihan.
I don't know much about other pools.  Slush invented pooled mining and when his pool became the biggest he banned new people from joining, because he didn't want to have a majority of hash power.  He also invented Trezor, the first hardware wallet, making bitcoin much safer to use.

Yes it can go below 1.  If your transaction is 225 bytes (a very common size) then a fee of 1 sat/byte is 225 satoshis.  You could drop it down to 224, 223, etc...   For example, if you total transaction fee is 100 sat that means that you are paying 100/225 = 0.444 sat/byte.
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:27:28
You can decide that.  Since a bitcoin is only worth $10,000 to you then you should sell it, because right now you can get $11,000.
Since a bitcoin is only worth $10,000 to you but now it has gone to someone who values it at more than $11,000, maybe $12,000.  Since you went from having $10,000 worth of bitcoin (to you) to having $11,000, you are now $1000 richer.  The other guy went from $11,000 to having bitcoin worth $12,000 (to him) so now he is also $1000 richer.  $2000 worth of wealth was added to the economy.
That's how wealth is created, through voluntary exchanges between people.  Socialist attempts to control the economy destroy this wealth production mechanism, and replace it with a wealth destruction mechanism.  Imagine that you are a very productive White farmer in Zimbabwe.  You have a farm worth $1,000,000.  Now the government confiscates it and divides it among 10 black people.  These blacks have no idea how to farm efficiently, so each portion is only worth $10,000, for a total of $100,000.  Just like that government policy has destroyed $900,000 worth of wealth, 90% of the farm's value destroyed.  Zimbabwe went from being a food exporting country to a country with famines.  The government kept printing more and more money in an attempt to build wealth, but the result was that the value of their currency went to 0.
The same thing is happening in Venezuela.  It used to be a rich country, now people cannot afford to eat and people are dying of starvation.
The same thing happened in China, Russia, etc... everywhere that socialism flourishes people die.  Even the Mayflower Pilgrims tried socialism, and half of them died the first year.

Of course he didn't, why should he give an answer to someone who writes a very short post that starts with a very rude statement?  


Now it seems that you just got off on the wrong foot and that you aren't normally a troll, so I'll answer your question.
If there is no backlog then fees will quickly fall to zero, like they were in the old days.  If fees fall to zero then the only incentive to mine is the block reward subsidy.  The subsidy is a temporary measure to support miners until transaction fees are high enough to compensate them for securing the block chain.  Thus, the subsidy is cut in half every four years.  Transaction fees are supposed to replace the block reward, which means that they need to go up.
If there is always extra space available in blocks then miners will be forced to take what they can get, even transactions that are just 1 sat/byte.  That's not enough to support the mining infrastructure that we need.

Blocks could be created almost instantly, if it weren't for the last step.  The last step is finding a pseudo-random number (hash) that meets certain criteria.  Miners keep trying until an acceptable hash is found.  The criteria for this number, and thus the difficulty of finding it, is automatically adjusted to ensure that a new block is found approximately every 10 minutes.

No it isn't.  You are lying to yourself.  You know that your country no longer has real elections.
The left was defeated in the 2015 legislative elections, so what did the left do?  They took away all of the powers from the elected legislature and gave it to a new, appointed "legislature" called the Constituent Assembly.  The left controls all 545 seats in the Constituent Assembly and there is no debate, all of the dictator's proposals are approved.
The only way out of your situation involves bullets and machetes.  Maduro won't step down ever, unless forced out by someone even more evil, such as Tareck El Aissami.

No, it is possible for everyone to be rich.  However, simply giving everyone a billion dollars won't actually make anyone rich, in fact it would make everyone poorer.

People are downvoting you because they don't understand a simple fact:
Every dollar that has gone into bitcoin (someone buying bitcoin) is also a dollar that went out (someone selling bitcoin).  So the net amount of money people have spent on bitcoin is $0  - yet bitcoin has value.  The value of bitcoin is extra value.
Also, the way you phrased it was kind of weak and probably got you a few more downvotes.  When you say "additional money" they think that you are suggesting inflation creates additional wealth, which it doesn't, and I'm sure you're aware of.

The world is filled with risk, and you can't do much to reduce it.  Reducing one kind of risk often increases another.
For example, let's say that you own a store.  You decide that you don't want to risk losing money to double-spends, so you refuse to accept 0-confirmation transactions.  Have you actually reduced your risk?
You reduced one kind of risk (losing money double-spends) but you greatly increased the risk of losing customers to the store across the street.
Always keep your real goal in mind.  Your goal isn't to avoid double-spends; your goal is to make the most profit that you can.  Achieving your real goal might mean accepting the fact that your lose small amounts here and there to double-spenders.
It is the same as with anything else in life: a numbers game.  I used to be scared of rejection, so I never went after girls.  Guess what?  My real goal (to be happily married) was hindered by that.  Eventually I read game/pua forums and figured out that I needed to take action.  Now I have a wife, four children, two houses, etc...

The most obvious way is in diluting your vote.  The more voters there are, the less your vote matters.
Then there is the resource situation.  The more people we have competing over scarce resources, such as land, the less each person can have.  Many people now are too poor to even live in a real house; they are forced to make due with apartments.  This issue is somewhat confused by the apparently empty land available, but people don't just want any land, they want land in certain places (near coasts, trade routes, rivers, etc..)
Just as important, but more difficult to wrap your head around, is that America is a thing of value that our ancestors built.  The stability, the legal system, good neighborliness, etc... that's something of value.  If we share it we are giving some of that value away.  Now you might think "well if we share the rule of law with other people we still have it for ourselves" but that really isn't true.  You can try to influence other groups with some success, but when you mix them the influence goes both ways.  People who enter our society don't become part of our society, they either create their own rival society, or they and we blend together to form some sort of in-between society.

If it comes from some random dude that I am paired up with on a decentralized exchange... my account is going to be frozen and I might get my house raided.  I would have to prove that the money is "clean" and that could take years.  Meanwhile I don't have access to any of my money so my bills don't get paid, I lose my house in foreclosure, etc...

Ok, those blocks that are downloading, think of them as moments in time.  Each represents 10 minutes of bitcoin's history.  Now imagine that you are in some sort of time-travel/alternate dimension movie.  People can split the time line, by creating a fork in the block chain.  Since this summer people have done this many times, each fork creating a new currency.  Since these forks share the same history (up to the point where they forked) you will have coins on both chains (time lines).
BCash forked on August 1st, 2017.  If you had Bitcoin at that time you still have the same amount of Bitcoin, but you also have the same amount of BCash.  BCash was the first fork and was supported by some people with big pockets, so it gained some popularity.  At first they called their coin "Bitcoin".  They tried to steal the name!  Then they partially backed down and now they call their coin "Bitcoin Cash" but they still insist that their coin is the real Bitcoin.  Their logo is the regular bitcoin logo but they just rotated it slightly.
Then people made Bitcoin Gold, then Bitcoin Diamond, then Bitcoin Lighting, then Lightining Bitcoin, BitcoinX, Super Bitcoin, Bitcoin Boy, Bitcoin Wonder, Bitcoin Pay, Bitcoin, Hot, Bitcoin Cash Plus, Bitcoin Clashic (this is actually the original "Bitcoin Cash"), Bitcoin FILE, Bitcoin Pizza, etc... I am not exaggerating.  These coins all exist and you have all of them.

Well you don't have to go all the way.  If you know when you stopped using bitcoin before you can be sure.  It looks like you stopped on June 13th, 2011.  Block  was on June 14th, 2011.  If you get that far then the balance you see is your actual balance.


If you can figure out which addresses you used you can check them out on a block explorer website.  Figuring out which addresses you used could be some complicated detective work, letting it sync is wiser.

Some people buy altcoins because they are bitter.  They think that it is too late to get into bitcoin so they latch onto an altcoin or two.
Some people don't really understand that cryptocurrency is pretty close to a winner-take-all system.  They don't realize that bitcoin is going to continue to dominate.
Some people do understand that one coin will dominate, but they foolishly think that some altcoin will snatch the crown from Bitcoin.
Some people enjoy gambling on altcoins.  They try to buy low and sell high, leaving someone else to hold the bag.  This group is probably the largest.

You are downloading every single bitcoin transaction ever.  Keeping this download manageable is one of the reasons for having a block size limit.
Your balance shown will start off at 0, because you didn't have any bitcoins when bitcoin first started in 2009.  Once you download a block containing a transaction in which you received some bitcoin your balance will go up.  Your balance will go up and/or down as new blocks are downloaded, based on your activity at the time.
You also have BCash, a fork coin that calls itself "Bitcoin Cash" in order to confuse people.  It has a little value and you will want to dump it as soon as possible for more bitcoin.  There are other fork that have given you free trash money, but they are worth even less than BCash and probably won't be worth it to you.

They are cash settled; no bitcoin changes hands.  This means that people are just gambling on the price rather than investing, which means that it is a zero-sum game (negative, once you subtract fees) rather than something where everyone can win (such as when you buy real bitcoin).

There are no metric/SI currencies, not even the one that you would expect - the euro.
Currencies have, at most, two major units: dollar/cents, pount/pence.
The ideal solution would be to define a bitcoin as 100 sat, but that isn't going to happen.

It means that your dollars only retained 60% of their original value.
Let's say we meet a genie in the year 1900.  He gives us immortality and a pile of gold each.  You decided to keep your gold, but I am foolish and I sell it for dollars.
At first you and I both have the same value, equal to a pile of gold.  As time goes on, the value of my dollars goes down.  Your pile of gold is still worth a pile of gold, but my dollars are only worth 60% of that, a much smaller pile.  Year after year, the amount of gold that I can buy with my pile of dollars declines.  That value of my dollars is slowly siphoned off through inflation.  That value goes to the entities which print more money: governments and banks.

No, you don't understand.  You need to think outside the box.  The money isn't going into bitcoin, *bitcoin is becoming the money*.
If no one wanted dollars then dollars would no longer be money. Imagine if everyone simultaneously tried to *sell* their dollars for bitcoin. Bitcoin replaces the dollar as money, dollars are just some weird asset that people can speculate on.
The same is true of gold.  Gold is money.  Some people are using their gold to buy dollars, which they then sell for bitcoin.  The fact that the dollar (euro, pound, etc...) is used at the intermediary shows that dollars are the most moneyful asset used in that particular chain of transactions, but that doesn't mean that gold and bitcoin aren't money either.  When one currency goes up in value at the expense of another, it means that monifulness is flowing from one to the other.

Banks and bank towers existed back when everyone use metal coins as money.
If people were rational, banking would only be a minor segment in the economy.  History proves otherwise and reckless banking has been with us for a long, long time.  Governments and religion tried to ban banking or reduce its impact in the past, because of the chaos that it causes, but people wanted it so much that it couldn't be stopped.
People are naturally optimistic because we are all descended from winners.

Bitcoin Core used to work the same way that Litecoin works now, but now that Bitcoin has moved beyond the toy/experiment it makes sense to let the market calculate fees (that's what a markets are for, calculating how to allocate resources).
Each wallet, node software, miner, etc... is free to create and enforce any fee policy that it wants.  If the wallet that you are using doesn't calculate fees to satisfaction then the solution is for you to get a new wallet.

Nationalism and Bitcoin go hand-in-hand.  I'm guessing that you're not aware of the fact that Nick Szabo (the creator of Bitcoin) is far right and that Ron Paul supporters make up a large portion of early adopters of both Bitcoin and the Trump campaign.  Bitcoin = Bit Gold = Gold = Far Right Economics.  USD = Fiat = Central Banking = Globalism.
I read an otherwise excellent blog by a jewish guy, and he hates Ron Paul and Bitcoin, because (as he sees it) if you are against central banks, you are against jews.

They don't control the keys to their stock portfolios either.  Occasionally, leftist governments seize part or all of people's retirement funds, but for the most part the risk is low.
