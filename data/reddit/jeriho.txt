Thanks, keep on buying. I will be selling again at the next ATH.
@_date: 2018-01-20 19:44:41
Unfortunately, nobody cares for facts, memes are literally taken more seriously advice than any authority. Bitcoin is pumped by memes and fake news.
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:06:13
I tried a few other crypto-subs, but it seems more or less the same. Right now, I came to the conclusion that the people who benefit most from crypto are miners, exchanges and scammer (pump-n-dump of alts, ponzi scheme a la bitconnect). It seems at one point we will end up with worthless tokens.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:34:58
That's the spirit, we need new money to drive the price up again.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:46:06
Nope, I sold in time
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:45:43
Nope, cashed out
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:01:39


Could you elaborate why it is so?
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:44:43
Bitcoin is like a lottery ticket, you buy and hold, hoping that one day either you win by selling it off to somebody else for a higher price or that it will be adopted as a new world currency, which would make you very rich as an early adopter.

All these things where new revolutionary  technologies.
Can you explain to me what EXACTLY is the benefit of using Bitcoins? 
The only argument I heard so far, is that it will go up in value, based on the past performance. I bought Bitcoins in 2013, tried to use them to buy something, not a great experience. And as a storage value, even holding cash is better, since it is less volatile.
Edit: of course, I should have mention that since I bought the price went up 10000%

I love it how r/bitcoin screams "adoption" at every small sticker they see, but you literally never see any news about Bitcoin adoption outside of this sub (and other circeljerk crypto-subs).

And it was risky, Apple mid 80's to mid 90's was often on the verge of bankruptcy.
Edit: some people say that Jobs main achievement was not funding Apple, but saving it in the 90's.
@_date: 2018-08-26 17:20:04
WTF is wrong with this sub? This is at the top right now, really??? This sub is more manipulated than btc itself...
@_date: 2018-08-27 16:06:37
Sure, I made +10.000%. But think about the poor bastards who bought it from me in Dec/Jan, they are at least -50% down.
@_date: 2018-08-28 06:14:36
Lol, so happy I bought in 2013 and sold most of it last Dec
Edit: lol at the downvotes, so many bitter people who brought at the top, when I was selling, thanks for your money guys, lmfao
@_date: 2018-08-26 17:03:14
Forgot to add that it is basically useless as well.
@_date: 2018-08-26 17:02:05
I am not, bought some btc's in 2013, was trying to use them, came to the conclusion that they are basically useless as currency and storage value. People keep buying them in hope they price will raise and they can sell them to someone else (greater fool theory). 
@_date: 2018-09-06 13:43:51
Thanks for this deep analysis, banksters want to kill bitcoins! NOW is the time to buy more and hodl strong!
@_date: 2018-09-06 15:03:40
Stay ignorant, bankster shill
@_date: 2018-05-26 09:32:52
I upvoted, but only because I am still holding some coins (after selling most of them back in Dec/Jan), and someone has to pump this shit. 
Btw, I bought them in 2013 for less than $100 each...
@_date: 2018-05-27 11:38:35
Thanks for posting, we need more naive bag hodlers

@_date: 2018-05-27 20:44:49
I simply lost hope, Bitcoin was introduced almost ten years ago, I was actually excited about it and bought in 2013 some coins. Well, five years later I think BTC has for most people only a speculative value, basically people buy in the hope of selling it later for more.
@_date: 2018-05-26 20:27:41
I am just fed up with the propaganda in this sub, fiat bad btc good. In reality people are encouraging others to buy btc just to drive the price up. The whole "Internet currency" never worked out, almost nobody is using btc for what it is actually intended, everyone hopes the price moons and to get their lambos.
@_date: 2018-08-26 12:05:49
Lol, so happy I sold most of that shit last Dec/Jan
@_date: 2018-08-26 12:07:13
No, but make others believe in it and buy in, I will be happy to sell them the rest of my shit
@_date: 2018-05-26 16:24:19

How dare you point out facts?! We are here to make fun of other currencies in order to forget that btc keeps falling!
@_date: 2018-05-26 11:16:34
Aggressively upvoted. I bought in 2013 for under $100. Sold most of it last Dec/Jan for $18.000, but I am holding still some of it, waiting for the next pump to sell it even higher :)

It is, but by saying "hodl" we can fool ourselves to believe it is something other than waiting for the next pump- er, I mean, next adoption phase.

@_date: 2018-11-25 13:39:25
My friend, hodlers were actually the only thing that was preventing btc from crashing completely. This "Hodl" meme was not an accident... they artificially keep btc price up by not selling, therefore reducing the supply.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:37:12
I reached my moon, hodlers do not hodl until the value is zero, they hold until they reached their goal. This was the original meaning, but on reddit it got distorted, into something like "hold my bags".
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:22:07

I don't even...
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:28:34
Just to add to that, he should look up penny stocks, pump-n-dumps we see in Bitcoin are well know in that area. Indeed, the mafia in ths us got into penny stocks pump and dumps some years ago. What we see in Bitcoin and other cryptos is the same thing just on an international scale. This market is completely unregulated it must be the wet dream of any scammer.
@_date: 2018-04-07 10:31:01
I don't get it why OP's bullshit post is allowed and other more serious posts get removed...
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:49:30
Bitcoin is the future, with the current development speed we could see it overtaking fiat in a few years. 
My estimate is that anyone who owns more than 1BTC will be the new crypto-l33t.

Nope, I really don't want others to know how much I sold
@_date: 2018-12-06 08:16:44
Keep in mind that the price has to go up more than 500% in order for the people who bought at ATH to break even.
@_date: 2018-12-06 17:37:14
Because the last suckers got burned and we need to find new ones. And we are running out of suckers...

Your bags must be getting heavy.
Everyone, literally everyone I knew was talking about BTC last Dec/Jan, some bought, others didn't. It doesn't matter how many do not own BTC, but how many are willing to buy.
You need to go outside of your mom's basement more often.
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:50:01
You forgot to mention that we need new suckers who buy at ATHs in order to pump the price.
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:49:56
He was asking me to sign a message with the key associated with my address, that way everyone could see the whole transaction history and know it was me.

How much do you get, shilling for BTC? Lmfao
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:24:14
True, that's why I sold most of my coins last Dec/Jan
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:33:39
It seems that the bitcoint market is very easy to manipulate, not surprising, since there is no regulation whatsoever. And the disinformation in this sub is just shocking. I am holding, I bought my coins pretty cheap.
@_date: 2013-11-06 14:02:25
As I said, it's just a guess. But it's clear that some pumping is going on, the question is if bitcoin remains stable when they decide to dump. This will show how stable the bitcoin market really is. Another indicator is the irrational behaviour of people, it's usually a bad sign. 
In the end nobody knows what will happen. I am holding, crash or not.
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:20:25


It usually is, try this one: 
@_date: 2018-12-08 11:52:16
Until it doesn't
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:02:39
The horizontal axis is the price of bitcoints, the green bars above the axis represent increases in buy orders,  red bars below the axis represent decreases in buy orders. Red bars above the axis represent increases in sell orders and green bars below the axis represent decreases in sell orders. 
Usually, the green bars above the axis should be on the left, the only reason why somebody wants to buy bitcoints ABOVE the current price is to pump the price, i.e. to increase the price of bitcoints. When the price reaches a certain value, he will sell all his bitcoints, this strategy is calles pump'n'dump.
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:46:01
Seems like somebody tries to increase the price by aggressive pumping. Typical pump'n'dump strategy. And I am getting already downvoted... damn it reddit, enjoy your bitcoincirclejerk
Here is how to read the graph:
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:00:35
That's the problem...
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:25:51
No, ask removed = green bars below the axis
@_date: 2013-11-06 07:26:04
I agree. I invested in bitcoins, came here for information but all I see is propaganda. People are encourage to invest at all time high prices and anyone critical gets down voted. I am guessing there are some people behind it, which just want pump'n'dump. Yesterday somebody cashed out a huge amount and it looked like the bubble was bursting. I saw also people buying above the price, to pump the price further. 
Personally, I hope the ride continues, but my guess is that the we see a huge crash in next two weeks. 
Edit: btw, if anybody wonder what pumping is, these screens where take few minutes ago:
 
Green bars above the axis represent increases in buy orders, usually they should be on the left, but clearly somebody gives buy orders ABOVE the current price. This way he can push the price further up.
@_date: 2013-11-07 09:53:30

@_date: 2013-11-07 10:11:01
Thanks for your comment, at least some reason in this place. I invested in bitcoints, but what's going on here is just insane. Everyone slightly critical gets downvoted and called FUD. On the other hand, the front page is filled with cheap propaganda. 
I assume it's pump'n'dump, let's see how this will end...
