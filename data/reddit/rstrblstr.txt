Oh shit. You're Erik Voorhees.

Bitpay makes it really really easy. They have modules for most eCommerce backends, and the Magento one was installed and ready to go in about 15min. Then you just contact Bitpay, enter some info, and wait 12-24hrs for approval. Pretty smooth.

Sorry about that, the sale prices are already discounted. I'm not sure if the data team inputted them as regular prices or "sale" prices, but they should already be 20-30% marked down ---then you get an additional 10% off of that with Bitcoin.    So actually I guess it's not quite 40%. More like 28-37% off depending on the product. 
I'm not super familiar with all of the prices that the data department is doing, and I'm still pretty new here. I'll try and get better acquainted.
I will tell you this, though.. We've got another 20-30 SKUs going onto the site within the next few business days, and those might get heavier cuts depending on their inventory. Stay tuned.

I'll ask the customer service guys and see if we have anything like that. I'm PMing you about the tech problem now.
EDIT: I saw the problem too. Not sure why that's happening. I created a workaround by displaying ALL items by default.

I keep trying to convince them to carry [Jill-Jets](
The Patio stuff we carry is pretty awesome as well. Really well made ultra-weather-resistant polymer-based wicker stuff.
I really want this thing:   It's huge!

haha... I just don't like being responsible for what other people do with their money.

I keep doing a double-take around here when people talk about those.

BitPay converts to USD automatically with payouts, so there's fairly little risk at the moment for the company itself.
However, he was all excited about investing, etc, and I told him to cool it on that until he had a chance to learn more because it's so volatile and storage of large quantities can be risky using online wallets.
*"Would I suggest that you invest in Bitcoin? No.*  
*Am I investing in Bitcoin? Yes."*

and customers are exclusively American.
But he's right, it was vague. I personally try to think about nation states and their claimed territories as little as possible, just for peace of mind; perhaps I've gotten rusty.

I'm going to continue looking through the inventory, but we do apparently have models that meet the floor... it's just a matter of searching for them. Here's one:

2 hours later and I just got it.  I'm going to blame that one on me being a hard worker.

Damn. We apparently don't ship to Hawaii...  but let me get in contact with the owner and see if he wants to make exceptions. It might be an issue with our freight contracts. You'd probably end up having to pay a bit for shipping.  EDIT: I'll be in contact with you as soon as I hear back.

Does BitPay offer this? We're going through BitPay at the moment, just to make everything easier.
@_date: 2013-07-18 19:04:30
Whoooops. Fixed.

It looks like most of the flush-with-floor models are "Traditional" style ---not much of a Modern-style selection. Here's what I found:
**Flush with floor:**  
  
    
    
    
    
    
**Almost flush:**  
    
    
  
    
    
**Flush with Floor, but not Virtu products (only 5% off):**  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**Almost Flush:**  
  
**NOTE:** Call about "Out of Stock" items because we *may* still have units in stock, they just get re-prioritized for other markets sometimes.
