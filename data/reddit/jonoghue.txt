Tell me about it. Had some change left over at one point last year and a few months later I saw that suddenly it was worth double. Instead of thinking "holy crap, i should invest!" i thought "holy crap, i can buy more stuff on SR!" I'm not a smart person.

For $100, all you can really do is buy. I'd be hesitant to at the moment though because it looks like we're due for a big correction. As far as mining goes, the only way to economically mine bitcoin is with expensive hardware called an ASIC. Some altcoins can be mined with graphics cards still, but mostly with high end AMD cards. I ran a benchmark on my ~$600 GTX 1080 and it can mine about $2.50 worth of altcoin per day, and I don't think that will even cover the cost of the electricity needed to do so.

for every time i've made a little more bitcoin day trading, i've lost some 10 times. 
it's /possible/, but timing the market fluctuations is
mostly luck

we'll put it this way. a year ago, .109 bitcoin was worth $83.
the general consensus is to just let it sit, or "HODL" as they say.

this is the problem with the bitcoin community on reddit, mocking new investors who aren't comfortable HODLing and panic when bitcoin drops right after they buy some, instead of giving the new buyers the credit for making the value skyrocket in the first place.

he's asking a serious question. if you are too much of an ass to give a serious answer, fuck off.

except it takes days unless you want to spend like $50 in fees...

I first heard about bitcoin when i first heard about silk road (the dark web drug marketplace) I didn't buy anything from it, but i went to the website just to see it. this was when bitcoin was maybe $20, so stuff was being listed for like 3-5 BTC. didn't know much about bitcoin, so I wouldn't have even thought to invest

That's not what I said, I said that (at the time) even as much as the price had fallen, it was still a 25% increase over the last week. it's gone down more so now it's about 10% up for the week, but that's still a very good increase.  Stock investors can usually expect 7% per year! it may even go down further, but this is no crash.  if the price goes up a ridiculous amount  over the course of a day and then inevitably corrects, that is not a crash. "hodlers maybe will make 20% a year" what the hell are you talking about? bitcoin is up 88% over the last year!

Half of the reason is that i'm terrible at it, but also because it just keeps going up and up and up, there are rarely significant enough dips to be worth risking trying to sell high and buy low. Altcoins are probably better for day trading but it's also much more difficult than you'd think to predict what will happen next. Also i'd keep a close eye on bitcoin, it's looking pretty likely that there will be a massive correction some time soon. People joke about the "bitcoin bubble" being a myth but with this kind of exponential growth it's pretty much a certainty
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:09:21
That's much more fitting. and when the price skyrockets that much in such a short period of time, it's almost certain to happen.

it's 24/7. however on coinbase it tends to refresh very slowly. if you want to see a more live chart, check out gdax, which is owned by coinbase. if you want to day trade, which I wouldn't recommend, you'd want to use gdax.

I love how people keep calling this a crash. "oh my god bitcoin crashed! We haven't seen prices this low since yesterday!" as of right now we're still up 25% for the week...

the value of any asset is only what people are willing to exchange for it, whether it's gold, bonds, stocks, dollars, data etc. anything can crash, even precious metals can crash, in 2011 silver was nearly $50/oz, now it's only $15, only 30% what it was. how real or fake you want to call something is irrelevant. is money "real?" it's just a piece of paper, in fact most of the time it isn't even that, it's numbers in a computer just like crypto. and it too can crash. the venezuelan bolivar is "real" yet it's completely worthless.

I remember the first time it hit 5k...like a year and a half ago T.T
@_date: 2018-03-31 01:46:14
is it bad that I got excited when I hit .1btc today? 
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:14:39
I'll gladly take it
