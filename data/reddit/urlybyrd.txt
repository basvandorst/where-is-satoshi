If you're willing to go to jail, then pretty much anything you can hide from them.  A bar of gold hidden somewhere, data on a usb, hell, even cash. 
You're crazy if you think the government can't take your bitcoin.  Sure you can refuse to give, but if they wanted enough - for say payment of taxes, use in a crime, pissed off the wrong person - then you either give it to them, or you go to jail for obstruction of justice.  Just like anything else.

Well if the government doesn't know about your bitcoin - or in my case, my gold, usb, cash - then what are we talking about?  You can get any of the things I listed just as anonymously as bitcoin, probably even easier and with less of a trail after the fact. 
And your original question just asked for one 'thing you can own that the government can’t forcibly take from you' - not one thing that you can transport through airports.

First time working with AppleScript so might be overkill but this works:
    on findAndReplaceInText(theText, theSearchString, theReplacementString)
    	set AppleScript's text item delimiters to theSearchString
    	set theTextItems to every text item of theText
    	set AppleScript's text item delimiters to theReplacementString
    	set theText to theTextItems as string
    	set AppleScript's text item delimiters to ""
    	return theText
    end findAndReplaceInText
    set json to (do shell script "curl 
    set json to findAndReplaceInText(json, "[", "")
    set json to findAndReplaceInText(json, "]", "")
    tell application "JSON Helper"
    	set result to read JSON from json
    	set price to price_usd of result as number
    end tell
    set result_string to "QRL  $" &amp; price &amp; ""
