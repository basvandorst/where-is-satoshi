They didn't even have to try.
BFL is literally satan's greed.

I'm not doing anything to the bitcoin hash rates. Who are you talking to? :S

It got a little weird around the actual difficulty change.
It now reads:


And that's with only 5 blocks mined thus far.

Yea, it's a bitch.
I just tabulated about 500 lines of income and expenses digitally (thank god TD offers statement downloads in csv format!), and had to fill in another 100 or so by hand... reading every single line of every statement I had issued for 2014.
Fun, fun!

And what country is that?

Thanks! Unfortunately they all went to pay interest from previous years of unpaid taxes :( I'm trying to do the right thing and fill them out on time this year, but I now realize why I let it lag for so many years in the past... filing your taxes is a confusing pain in the ass! (I'm self employed and thus can't just take my T4 slips to hrblock and have them done for $40 or whatever they charge... it's either I do them myself or pay some accountant thousands of dollars to do them for me.)


Lol, thanks. I thought it was funny too. I misread somebody elses nick as such and immediately registered it when I realized it was available :P

I'm guessing it's because it's one of the older and most cited PDFs on the internet at this point.
Google claims it has been cited 515 times by reputable sources, that's pretty significant for a pdf.

Why not donate your Bitcoin to something that will make the world a better place, instead of lining the pockets or already well-paid political staffers?
On a side note, I find it hilarious that Betfair allows betting on presidential elections worldwide.

I think that the bigger story here is that some dude has a stranglehold on the UK's pumpkin supply.
How much does a pumpkin cost in the UK?

I appreciate the response. I went with Section 3 myself.
It could qualify as "other properties" imho, but it's not real estate or depreciable property as defined by the CRA. Depreciable property are real, tangible goods that lose value over time. I know Bitcoin has lost value over the past year, but it's not real property.

[Nine months' tuition for 2014–2015 is $43,720. In addtion, undergraduate room and board is approximately $13,224 depending on the student's housing and dining arrangements. Books and personal expenses are about $2,790.](
tl;dr MIT students wipe their asses with $100 bills.
Knowing that, I'm actually surprised that 70% even bothered to claim the $100.

Have you ever tried to get a driver's license? Or do you follow your own mantra and just drive without one because you deem it unneccesary?
Because states do not just give out licenses because you ask permission to do so... you have to undergo training and take a test so that you know how to safely operate the potential-death-machine you're getting into.

Just playing the devil's advocate here...
But imho, people who are smart enough to "get" bitcoin, are not dumb enough to pay for porn. It's everywhere, and mostly free, especially for most of us neckbeards.
I have never even heard of porn.com to be honest, nor have any of my friends ever tried to pay for porn online.

Thanks for your input...

It's not... what alternate reality are you living in?
People are not punished for innocent mistakes made while driving.

I think the privacy oriented nature of Bitcoin and their users isn't going to translate into a lot of petition signatures.
With over 9 hours on the front page and 296 upvotes. This website has garnered only 18 signatures.

Uhhh, those paper bags by the window in the second image are clearly empty..?
