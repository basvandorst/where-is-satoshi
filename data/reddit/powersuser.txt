With a ledger/trezor your key never touches your computer/internet. No matter how safely you store your keys, you have to input them into your computer in order to use them. This opens you up to keyloggers, malware etc. A hardware wallet holds the keys and uses them to sign the transaction then sends the signed transaction back to the computer, keeping the keys isolated. Plus they feel super cool to use.

The whole point is that there are no pre-printed codes. That's the scam.

Hey congrats on sobriety. I just hit 4 years a couple days ago. All I can say is that what you are doing right now is a really big deal, and the implications and benefits of it will probably continue to reveal themselves in varied and surprising ways if you continue to work at it.
That really sucks about the money. It obviously does. But there are a lot of ways to look at it. For instance, if you still had the bitcoins, and still had the addiction, what do you think your chances of kicking it now would be? Maybe good, maybe not so good? I know I personally wouldn't have quit shit if I'd have been sitting on a Scrooge McDuck pile 4years ago...
I assume you spent plenty of non-btc cash on reefer right? And I assume you sold the btc for more than you paid for it. So really you just got a bunch of weed at a really good discount, and avoided loosing more cash than you would've otherwise. 
Lots of people pay much steeper prices on their way to sobriety. Like years of their life in prison. Or permanent physical impairment. Or the accidental death of another person on their conscience, forever. I know yeah it's "just weed" and that type of shit is less common, but who knows for sure where that path could've lead you? Personally, I knew I had some problems when I was "30ish", but I definitely didn't expect them to lead to the place I was at when I finally put everything down at 40ish. 
We think of money as a statically valued thing because it's raw math, but really it has different values in different situations. The 71bucks I spent yesterday bringing my sick dog to the vet means squat to me, compared to finding 71bucks in an old coat when I was unemployed and desperate. Your painful memory of lost money may turn out to be a fundamental building block of your sobriety. At some point in the future you very well may look back at the "price" you paid to stay sober as a real bargain.

Also there's the fees that stack up.
