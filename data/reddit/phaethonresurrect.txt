Bitcoin Causes Inflation
It occurred to me the other day that the wide spread use of Bitcoin for everyday transactions alongside fiat(s) would lead to further liquidity in the market. Essentially Bitcoin use concurrently with fiat is the equivalent of printing a bunch of $7,000 bills (value as of writing) and flooding circulation with them.
Thoughts, ideas?  I'm not trying to ruffle feathers or create 'fud'. I haven't seen this topic floated before, and am interested in the insight of others more learned in economics.

If that doesn't say something about bitcoin's value as a reserve asset. The guy that will use gold to fill holes in your mouth, prefers bitcoin as a payment method.

I would think the cost of mining Bitcoin is not relevant to inflationary pressure.  The money that is used to mine is not destroyed, just transfered to another party. The transfer is what makes an economy in my understanding. The fiat that pays to mine Bitcoin remains in the system. 
What if the utility company were accepting Bitcoin as payment for the power required to mine more Bitcoin. You wouldn't say the Bitcoin transfered to them as payment was removed from the economy would you?

That's cultural appropriation!

Maybe, we're all Satoshi.

Reread what you just wrote in reply to what I wrote. Do you 'hear' yourself? Of the two of us, I wouldn't be wagering that I were the one under the influence of a mind altering substance.

Your handwriting's damn near as bad as mine(&lt;-joke). Nice effort to educate people.

Again with grandiosity, "Navy Seal level commando". And paranoia, "(coming) to get me!" You're bringing these things up, not I. Even the mention of drug abuse in our conversation, was brought up by you.

What exchanges is it on, what kind of wallet do I need?

Some people have a lot of faith in our justice system... I get the feeling they've not had much experience with it.

This Death Star is fully operational!

It's all fun and games until one of the coins in front throws up.

How many Satoshi you net?

That blast came from the Death Star. That thing is fully operational!

That better still be hot. And not have a bunch of Satoshi's stuck to the top of the box.
