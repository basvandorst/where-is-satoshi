what kind of sick Internet humor voodoo is this
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:54:53
You loaded up on massive shorts at $3200?! Uh dude....
@_date: 2017-08-15 08:00:58
yes sell everything while you can. bitcoin will go to zero. it will all end.
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:43:28
what movie is this?
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:23:18
I wouldn't buy, it's coming tumbling down after segwit is activated on august 25-27
@_date: 2017-08-04 09:32:36
LTC tanked after it was activated, actually. Tanked like 30%. Check your charts. The increase in price was up to the date of activation. We are seeing the same thing with BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:42:38
YOU" TELL 'EM !
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:59:47
4 billion buddy, but maybe 4 trillion if bitcoin can 1000x from here haha.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:03:59
Nice, you remind me of myself when I was 14 you young whipper snapper you.
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:14:20
Same here brother, selling to buy back at $2900
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:32:36
I don't know. IS HE?
@_date: 2017-09-02 04:14:20
down down down !!!!
@_date: 2017-09-23 06:58:58
yup, sell, everyone is doing it
@_date: 2017-09-10 04:52:40
sell everything buy back lower
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:30:59
China told me
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:48:47
Monero, technically, and now eth.

i don't get it?
@_date: 2017-09-10 13:01:28
Realistically, I think most Americans think $3800 is the bottom but I believe it's either $2400, $2900, or $3300
@_date: 2017-09-11 07:12:17
Dude, Chinese don't know either. They are waiting for PBOC announcement. Why is this so hard to understand. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:15:29
Good job neglecting to mention Bitcoin bottomed at $190 after the bear market caused by the 2013/2014 crash. Wonderful circle jerk this is. Bravo.
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:13:01
Yes, sell and buy back lower, this will go to $3400 at least if not $2900
That's what everyone else is doing
Don't listen to these guys, they just want you to stabilize price
@_date: 2017-09-10 13:37:50
Where's the Bitcoin spaceship
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:34:37
Are you kidding bro? Bitcoin has had terrible ROI compared to XMR and ETH. I got out of BTC in 2014 and into XMR.
@_date: 2017-09-26 22:03:55
Because people believe the worst "crash" would simply send us to $2400 and immediately spark a bull run to $6000. The level of endorsement from world leaders, governments, the media, finance moguls, etc is beyond anything we saw in 2013/2014 or prior. People back then were worried Bitcoin would be criminalized or the protocol itself would fial.  Those fears appear gone now.
@_date: 2017-09-10 05:55:04
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:52:19
Pathetic, the correct trading move here is to sell and repurchase at support. Support could be $3600, $3400, $2900, or even $2400.

@_date: 2017-05-26 04:28:10
americanpegasus, great to see you back! How do you feel about technologies like Tumblebit and MimbleWimble/Grin in comparison to Monero/Cryptonote? Thank you.

You're insolvent. I'm about to go on the run soon.
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:26:10
Yes, why yes it is, sell everything.

$1600 by August 1 imo
@_date: 2017-07-29 12:34:18
I'm thinking $2200
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:24:34
Best advice. What do you think of the trend of all the people on who say buy and HODL no matter what? Even when they purchased at $300+  ? I think eth has serious porential to hit $90 and $60 again in 2018, but nobody believes me =p

I'm also a full time crypto trader / investor and agree with you 100% My trading style is based primarily off the news cycle, predicting outcomes of impactful events, and technicals.

Link to the interview ?
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:32:51
Actually, maybe that was just it, everything else seems accurate, I don't think we know for certain if Vinnik or BTC-e was directly involved in the hacking.

It's a joke, it means 
@_date: 2017-07-21 06:40:59
Did you hold? I held throughout that bubble, couldn't believe how low Bitcoin went over the following two years.
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:16:45
Just goes to show how bad this speculative bubble has become. You think BitConnect traders don't know it's BitConnect? Of course they do, they're just gambling with the other day traders and making money :) Watch this all crumble after August 25 when Segwit activates and the real sell off begins. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:29:29
Agree. I got lucky with Monero because the value was so low compared to what I paid that I didn't bother selling. Ended up being worth a fortune.

I think you're a hero for trying to save the DAO situation within the rules of the framework and code. Just read the Bloomberg piece on you, amazing story.
