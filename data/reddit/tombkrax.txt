I had casually made a wallet, and thought I had encrypted it with a known password.
Then I made the purchase, which went through, and got transferred to my wallet. Turns out, I forgot my password :(

Yes :(

Not billions, a standard processor is around 3GHz which is around 3 billion binary operations per second (a single guess takes MANY MANY binary operations).
And if you think it's that easy to break a password, why would they even work in the first place?
Let's say the space of possible characters is 50 - 36 alphanumeric characters, and 14 (chosen arbitrarily) special characters. !"
My password is 16 characters long, this means there are 50^16 possible characters. Even assuming we can do a *trillion* guesses per second (1000 times faster than you suggest), it [would take 48 million years to search through all possibilites](
Definitely not feasible.

I use both alphanumerals (capital, and non-capital letters) and special characters, and the password is ~16 characters long. It is definitely infeasible :D

Multibit, I tried getting JackTheRipper working, but I kind of gave up.  I might try again later, because I *think* I have a pretty good idea of what the password looks like, I just can't get any of my permutations to work.
