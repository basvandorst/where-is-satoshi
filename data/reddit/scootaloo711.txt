AFAIK it is at the point of very-low inflation. There is fear it could become deflation. Deflation is bad for the economy. So the action is probably not wrong per se.
IMHO they should fix the economy. Whats done now is only preventing or curing the symptoms. It's also easier to be exploited by big players and vice-versa hurts the small ones.

My logical conclusion is that the change of law is flawed:
a) That you can't file the losses you had before the date.
b) It should only apply to shares that we're bought after the date - thus truely realizing that gain.
If b) is not taken into account, it should be taken to court.
@_date: 2014-09-02 07:15:07
I agree, the equilibrium is not there yet. We'll just get in a [Pork Cycle]( So after mining has significantly reduced supply and demand has met this remaining supply prices will rise again. Currently the miners already produced ~13.5% inflation of coins. This is too much at this stage where there are private holders but almost no business risks holding coins instead just swaps with fiat.

* usable account statements...
* ...to import them in bookkeeping software
* local only focus, restricting global usage (except for security if that applies)
* giving all the data to the USA/NSA (see SWIFT)
* automated/timed payments and withdraws

Still if you use the the wrong hardware, CPU, GPU, USB stuff. For every dime you earn you put a larger magnitude of dimes of on their bill. So for example if you use a USB miner and consume 10$ in electricity while earning $1 a week it might not be a problem. But if you put that on a larger scale you could risk your job. Nobody gives free utilities and stays calm when they are overused.

The other way around, some people nowadays put a shopping cart plugin on their site that already gives them all the features they need. Unfortunately they now rely on said plugin to fulfil the needs.

[They announced a new terminal series desk/lane/move as well as a operating system "Telium Tetra" in November]( These series are not selling yet (according to the homepages). The OS will have an app-store that Paymium has build an optional (correct in the headline) app for.

I'm not a miner and were searching just today for a theoretical approach to this. These numbers check right out with what i came up with.
Assuming the lowest energy cost available, at what price would any mining rig consume more than it produces?
$/kWh | $/BTC | examples
0,02 | 28,-- | iran
0,03 | 39,-- | russia
0,04 | 52,-- | serbia
0,043 | 55.56 | Howto:
* 
* Difficulty Increment: 0 (irrelevant)
* Electricity Price: 0,0x (obviously)
* BTC/USD: play around till you have three hardwares shown with an (absurdly high) break even; thats the result
So below 40$ "mining" can only cover costs in middle east or asian countries or special snowflake places like with zero cost hydro energy. Then the "miners" should keep mining for freedom (51% attack anyone?) and by that make a return to the average pc at home.
I'm probably missing something? I certainly don't know how the difficulty adjustment will play into that.

ran it trough the [calc](
120-chip-box ~1000GH at 300W and 0.05$/Wh selling at 200$ means 126 days to earn the 250$ back (without diff. adj.)
Seems long. It's not like miners have to turn off their machines now. Quite the contrary, with good energy prices most should be profitable &lt;100$ but to invest now that the ROI is over 3 months away is very risky.
Hope it's just a [Pork Cycle]( - which also occurs in housing for example. As long as the over-demand  holds the price down investments stiffle. Then when the under-supply is clearly visible, investments come back with full force. In the housing market this mostly triggers building projects when it is already too late. Thus always giving a up and down of the market dynamics instead of a nice balance.
For BTC a mining crisis may as well trigger another bubble. If the network does not grind to a halt that is.

The money supply (M3) in November 2014 was 10207 billion euro, so 720 billion euro is an increase of around 7% not counting other factors that grow this number.
Up to 12% growth of this value can be witnessed from 2005 to 2008. From 2009 to 2013 it was less than 3% with last year marking a growth of 3,12%.

I've looked at what this PayCenter provides and it rings a amber alert for me. It seems you get a full SEPA account number and a debit card. The kicker is the open advertising for P-Konto (*Pfändung*/seizure protected) and with a little googling they seem to give accounts to almost anyone.
Now if this bank is notoriously used by fraudsters, who for an ebay example build up reputation first and then sell something without delivering, a company might not want to deal with this bank at all.
Funny that fidor accounts are used by fraudsters too [(NSFW:crimenetwork.biz)](

She actually spoke out in [this documentary](
. I already give her credit to appear and be so outspoken in this movie. To me it's a reasonable explanation that the CDS she **and** her team created had some good applications but since all the banks over-applied them the whole thing went south.
[rest of the comment is a mess sorry]
A lot of banks thought they shoveled their risky credit away - into the system. But they also used it to take on way to much more credit, something they did not have to do unless... GREED. So if you'd label CDS as "too evil" you would have to label a lot of other financial products too. Bankers will take on high risks in pursuit of fulfilling their greed at any chance. The only way to stop them is to also let them burn. You'll see at the end of the documentary that we all already slept trough that.

In their defense:




That is a socialized loss and pretty normal, others call it "clawback" and it's a feature on okcoin too. A 5% socialized is pretty uneventful. In late 2014 there were three settlements with 21%, 11% and even 25% socialized losses. Since then a insurance fund has been set up which gets depleted by these losses first while also being increased by taking part of the trading fees. So far it has worked as a good buffer on the crash in early 2015.

As far as i know the full 1000 BTC where a withdrawal request that was send to a wrong address after that address has been changed to look like a previously used one, so the staff member that checked the withdrawal did also not recognize the error first. It is unknown if the wrong address has been brought into the system via an technical injection but as there was only one account compromised it may have just been put there by someone that got held of the account.

It helps a little now that i had time to read the whole documentation.
As i understand your platform is tailored to only trade between two members and minimize risk of default.
Other platforms socialize the losses if the other member defaults or even keep a reserve for such losses.
At yours there is no such thing. That is why the portfolio is fully collateralized and the limits are pretty close.


So if a member only makes a small deposit but is able to put up risky positions that wipe out the deposit, after some time you gonna threaten to close their account?

But how would you argue with the exchange that these were actually your coins and you want the account holders name?
You could proof that you have the private key to the previous holding address (the one the coins were stolen from) but that would not prove that you are the sole owner. The tragedy is: once two parties know the private key to a address both have plausible deniability to be the owner or the thief.

SEPA transactions
Buyers with a fidor account can now reserve a configurable amount of euros for and from an interface off bitcoin.de. Upon buying, the exact amount will be substracted from the reservation. Seller does NOT need a fidor account.
If the seller has a fidor account the transaction is instant, if not he has to wait for the sepa transfer.
Previously fidor to fidor was pretty fast too, but it's not a guarantee that i will fill an order on fidor after i bought on bitcoin.de, i've could have spend the money on anything else. Now it's reserved on my bank account.
So this makes it faster for almost anyone involved without bitcoin.de taking too much control.

@_date: 2015-02-23 21:06:52
A this thing, i remember now. The letter is real and it is still a valid concern. From what i could gather of BaFins views is that they classify bitcoin in the same bracket as foreign or complementary currency (not cash) and so called accounting-units. Now the bulletin states that foreign cash ("Sorten") is not part of foreign currency ("Devisen"). But there is no hope in that because the § 1 KWG itself states that the commercial exchange of foreign cash is also part of the bill. So however they classify it, as long as they classify it as some form of money - unlike a car for example, there is no way around these regulations.
This is the bulletin:
The next thing one might want to know what differs in commercial exchange on bitcoin.de from localbitcoins. Insight provides a more recent journal that describes two kinds of platforms. A commisioning type and a multi-lateral type. The first one might be what bitcoin.de is, the second one what localbitcoins is - unless they do not apply for regulation anyway.
[Page 26]( be the same HTML](
Also here is a view from bitcoin.de itself, which also leads me to belief that in any circumstance, commercial or not, bitcoin.de assumes the party of the regulated broker:
BaFin also mention that miners that only sell are not affected, but by now most miners would be commercial to render huge debts on their taxes anyway?
Another way to think about is that a transaction over €2500 in cash is to be reported, which you can only do as a regulated entity. So yeah, don't local trade for a living.
