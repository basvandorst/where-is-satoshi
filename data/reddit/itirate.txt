Newegg taking advantage of the currently "low" trading value of btc! Pretty sneaky! But still a sweet deal for everyone

That's certainly a possibility, but I could see them holding onto some, since I'm sure many of their constituents think it'll come back up.
Or maybe it's completely reactionary! Maybe they saw the low value and was like, well our employees own some, let's do what we can to bring it more credibility right now!
But I feel as if this timing is no accident regardless. Maybe they just realized a lot of people who don't believe in it as much would pull out, so they just decided if they had something to spend on instead of converting to $$, they'd spend it instead.
No matter what, they're pulling something clever IMO, and I hope it works out for them!

True. A lot of people say, look, that's how it always has been, that's how it works in nature. But that strips away the potential and beauty that is now, and the power of humanity to change how things work for the better.
It's important to know your roots but to not change is to just be a slave to the past. Change is life and growth. Stagnancy is death and giving up.
