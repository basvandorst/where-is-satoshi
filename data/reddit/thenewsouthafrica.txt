1 Satoshi = EXACTLY 0.001 ZAR (South African Rand)
1 BTC = 100,000 ZAR 
pretty awesome price right now tbh :D
@_date: 2017-03-27 03:20:35
Because of China for some reason....
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:49:01
Yeah I mean, it's a good period for buyers, watch the charts
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:24:14
Willing to ride it out for a couple years. Just wondering if it will go down anymore still
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:16:14
time to buy? first timer here...
@_date: 2017-03-16 08:12:05
looks like it, gonna buy tonight
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:37:55
Until the price drops to the point where miners are no longer profiting. Everyone will shit themselves, huddle together, and sort this shit out. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 08:49:12
still buying
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:15:07

Click the link in the title, it takes you to the Changelly site. From there, login with Googl + (it's quick and easy, doesnt require signup).
Once that's done, fill in amounts and click proceed. Then put in a BTC address where it says "receiver address" - this is the address it will send the BTC to. Click proceed after adding the address, and then it displays a QR code + address where you send the BCC to. 
2 confirmations later and you're done! :) quicker then registering @ an exchange and waiting on 20 confirms, especially considering the block times!

I use this site every day as I liquidate penny stocks for clients. Was surprised to find that they now offer a Bitcoin and crypto section, which is basically like coinmarketcap

Oh well, all that means is that some of the fees go to me instead of to just the company - isn't that just the most evil thing ever, right? Anyways, whether ref link or not, it's a useful way of dumping this shitcoin and I used it myself, so not just a random shill. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:17:00
Okay anyone else w this issue, do this: 
Open BTC chrome extension
Tool, settings, reset app data

Ah, can't help I'm afraid, I used a HW wallet. Good luck though, hopefully you'll be able to dump soon

I sodl'd my car at $2250 and have been hodling since, I can now get almost 2 cars (got dat BCH bonus too!)
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:57:12
Nah, waiting on Changelly staff to "approve" the withdrawal, they don't have an auto withdraw system - someone has to approve it manually everytime time. Starting to lose hope, and it's like $350 owed to me
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:49:59
Use Changelly to claim your BCH, no signup and only 2 confirms required:

as someone who has worked in media in South Africa, I know this site and it's notorious for making up fake news. People still don't understand the concept of clickbate here, and still think that anything on the internet is real / official

Yep, shorting Bitcoin is a silly one. I lost some BTC not too long ago shorting at $4300 on BitMex. Literally 2 days later, we hit 5k and I got liquidated.

Yeah but numbers are contextual, although $1.3 doesn't seem like much now, it may have been like 50% back then, which = ~$1300 now

well duh, I'm a redditor
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:28:16
Exactly. Only once I actually started using BTC for paying and receiving money, have I really realized its true value. Fuck the price, I'm here for these fundamentals
@_date: 2017-07-02 00:45:24
What the fuck did I just read
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:36:10
Isn't most of the hashpower based in CHina?
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:30:21
Thoughts on this? If we all neglect to redeem our BCC, it becomes more scarce and this will boost the price. Surely we should dump it?
@_date: 2017-07-17 08:46:35
Yeah im pretty over my life's saving moving up and down because of people wanting to be rockstars
@_date: 2017-07-17 04:28:39
As far as I'm aware, it's not SegWit that's the issue - it's the 2mb block size increase that people are worried about
@_date: 2017-07-03 22:56:06
Thanks for this! :) One of the only helpful people among this cancerous reddit community
@_date: 2017-07-20 12:31:50
Why not just ensure a lock-in in this period? Now there's a small chance we may not have enough blocks for a lock-in this period
@_date: 2017-07-23 22:10:12
But nobody even WANTS to spend their Bitcoin... It's like retailers accepting gold. Okay that's cool, but most people wanna HODL their BTC because it's a store of value - the medium of exchange bit is just an added bonus
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:38:26
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:08:20

Does this explain why the transaction doesn't exist though? Usually, Bitfinex will still say "processing" at this stage. It's concerning that the status is "Completed" yet the transaction hasn't even been added to the blockchain, and appears not to exist at all...
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:37:45
@_date: 2018-12-04 21:25:24
Exactly - and miners will need to keep blocks moving forward, likely at a loss, during this time (in order to make it forward to the block where the adjustment would occur)
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:40:23
Nevermind, all good. Jesus that was a scare ahaha, should have had more faith in BTC

Probably, it's basically a Segwit enabled version of BTC
