As someone who runs news/information websites for a living i totally agree with OP. If it wasn't for ads we wouldn't earn anything and in turn we wouldn't be able to provide the good quality information. So Adblock is killing free information imo. The only other alternative is if people pay to read. Would you rather see ads or pay for content? Either donate to your favourite sites and ask them to provide a membership that doesn't display ads or browse the site happily with ads. Donating to adblock is probably the worst possible thing you could do to keep people providing good quality content on the internet.
A lot of people obviously don't understand that the ads on most sites would if lucky cover expenses and provide the owner minimum wage for the time they spend providing the information.

Instead of complaining is anyone interested in creating a solution? I run a small development team but would be looking for another programmer who knows the ins and outs of bitcoin to perhaps join and create something. PM me if you are interested and what your history and skills are.

judging by your views and mentality you show distinct characteristics of someone who is unsuccessful, or you may just be plain ignorant.

I have purchased through coinjar sent to my wallet then have stored offline, i wouldn't recommend keeping them on coinjar.
Here is how you can create a paper wallet which is quite simple to do and much safer:

Content creators will soon block anyone using ad-block imo.

Big news if done right imo.
Apple will of course need to be a middle man though to make bitcoin payments viable for them and to prevent scam apps.

then don't block their ads, or there won't be any news websites.
