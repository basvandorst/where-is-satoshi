I highly recommend this book for those of you interested in IT, science, society, or just plain cool postulates on what the coming decades hold.

Do you know what an ETF is? In the Cboe proposal the shares are 25 or 50 BTC chunks. It’s going to add much more liquidity to the spot markets.

Wallets are not insecure. An exchange is not a wallet. They do possess wallets, but the individuals do not control them, have no private keys, and are only able to move funds using the exchange website. 
SHA-256 encryption is a hell of a lot more secure than a mobile banking pin and password.

Some of us didn’t buy the top, you know. 
Bitcoin is a huge success. I can send money across the world and buy products from international retailers with no wait, no foreign exchange fees, and no fear of reprisal from banks.

Tons of people have lost their crypto to hacks. How does that hold as an argument against my claim that cheap, fast, secure and decentralized monetary transfers as being the killer app of cruprocurrency?

It will hit 5k after bch fork today. Maybe lower. But that will be the real dip. Bch will hit .35 or so, but that will be the end of the drama I hope. Will take a few days to settle down but we are going to see Ver and Jihan's last ditch effort today.

I’ll start worrying when it stops producing new yearly highs like clockwork.

I haven’t seen that word in a long time. Thank you.

At least I locked my price in at 20k on my Ledger. I can’t believe so many of you guys didn’t do this!

Fire anybody that would trade it. Trading BTC as a financial instrument is much different than buying actual cryptocurrency.

Yeah, super liquid. Look at Kraken BTC/USD markets just a few days ago. Swung between 8k and 12k like a boss on the 15m.

Did this to my birth certificate last year. Not a great feeling, but easy to recover from.

How late you there today I might stop by

Got liquidated on bitmex last night for about 1 btc. My stop didn’t trigger because I accidentally set post only. Oops.

If you do 100x like me, yes.
5-10x should be fine.

Especially next to the low sex drive ad. That’s a nice touch.

That’s a good analogy

Great game. It’s a shame the series has turned to garbage. Thanks, EA!
