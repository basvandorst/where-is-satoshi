Spending a lot of money to promote something is the antithesis of what was at the root of the Creation of Bitcoin.  Mr. Ver amassed his intial fortune within the traditional systems, using tactics that have been proven to be less than honest.  It is true that all things are mixed:  there is always good among the bad, and vice versa.  Mr. Ver is constantly bragging egotistically about his being a self-made millionaire --I do not trust him to be altruistic or even benevolent.  He is without a doubt looking for returns for himself when he spends his money.

There are a number of analysts who are forecasting that the USD is on the verge of losing status as the World's Reserve.  I am not qualified to have an opinion on whether this is true, but it raises the question:  would another currency take over, such as the Chinese Yuan or RMB?  ...or would the world's nations be able to choose between multiple exchange media such as Gold, Bitcoin....(??)

The first money I put into Bitcoin was in 2014, and the price was around $600/BTC.  I was pretty disappointed when it then dropped to the $200 range (that's like about -60%), but I had followed the rule of not putting in more than I could afford to do without.  It took over a year for the price to recover, but it eventually did.  I feel bad for someone who bought at $19K, but it happened, and there is really no reason to believe that money is lost.  Remember the USD is still inflating.

I use the Shift VISA Card, I have never yet had it be declined anywhere, although I suppose that may be possible in some instances: there are some usage limits. It works very smoothly and automatically converts BTC to $ at the point of sale. There are no user fees except if you withdraw cash at an ATM. It can be used in either debit (with a PIN number) or credit card (with a signature) mode.  You must, however, keep a working balance in your BTC wallet on Coinbase, for the card to draw from.  To get one, you first must have an active and validated Coinbase account, then go to the Shift Financial website to link your card.  There is a small fee for card issuance.

It is much too long to post here.  Here is the author's summary/TL;DR version:
* Since Bitcoin's first commercial "pizza transaction" in 2010, the price has skyrocketed by over 500,000,000%.
* So, it's natural for many people to believe that Bitcoin is a massive bubble.
* People may actually be paying for their pizzas with Bitcoin once again, but this time using extremely small portions of their Bitcoins.
* Lots of people have heard of Bitcoin, lots of people have an opinion on Bitcoin, but surprisingly, not that many people own Bitcoin.
* I've never witnessed a bubble that had a relatively low participation rate, was largely decoupled from Wall Street, and had so many people convinced that it was a bubble.
* This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing community, Albright Investment Group .

Yes this is what banks do. It's not just Chase.  I recently received a check from a friend who has been living at my house.  It was only about $2000, and I was going to use it to help in paying my property taxes.  I took it to my bank and deposited it with a teller. The teller looked at the check and called in a manager, who tagged the transaction as unusual, from an 'unknown maker,' and held the funds in the bank for five days, even though of course the check cleared within 24 hours.  But, I might add that I would personally choose not do business with Chase Bank, for a number of reasons.

I don't know, of course there is risk and no one knows for sure what will happen to the value of bitcoin at any given time.  However, I started with a small amount about three years ago and now my wallet is actually worth more than any other savings I have accumulated.  I keep a smaller spending balance in a Coinbase wallet and use their Shift VISA card for some of my everyday spending.  I have an IRA but otherwise keep very little traditional money in the bank.  Could be risky I guess but it feels good to me.

What does 'most accurate' mean?  each exchange is somewhat independent.  If you are buying you would prefer the lowest price to be the 'most accurate.'  If you are selling it would be the highest price, right?  The most accurate price is probably the arithmetic mean (average) of all the exchanges,

I'm all for helping to reduce the wealth inequality in the world, but let's stop blaming it all on 'boomers gaming the system.'

I think it is off chain, but Coinbase keeps your balance as BTC and calculates the exchange at the time of sale.  Merchant pays the VISA fees but it's no charge to the buyer. Never had a problem with mine for three years.  You can even get cash at an ATM but that does cost an extra $3

Yes, coinbase does carry insurance, and your US dollar deposits are held in the bank with regular FDIC insurance.  They keep most of the BTC reserve in cold storage offline, which is good.  However, they are the custodians of your account and they fully control the access to your money:  Just like a bank.  It is generally considered better to have your own wallet with your own private key so you access your funds directly on the blockchain without having to go through a second or third party, unless you can't trust yourself to keep secure your secret private key.

If it is not a lot of money, you should leave it on Coinbase until the network fees go down (hopefully that will happen soon).   Coinbase is not all bad, although there are many who love to hate it.  
To have control of your own keys you should eventually send your funds to a private wallet:  you can use an app such as Electrum, or Coinomi (there are many others but be careful that you use a trustworthy one), or a dedicated Hardware Wallet device such as Trezor or Ledger (a bit expensive for a higher security level), or record/write your keys down like on paper or some other medium and keep them securely offline (most secure but you will only be able to add/receive funds, not transmit)

Yes I use the Shift Card for everyday expenses.  It works fine, you just need to keep a BTC balance in your Coinbase account for spending.  At the time of the transaction, they buy the Bitcoin from you instantly and pay the merchant in dollars using a current exchange rate. They immediately also send you an email confirmation of the transaction.  The best part is that it's all covered by the VISA merchant fees, so you don't pay anything extra.

imho If you believe in Bitcoin you should use it: accumulate it, accept it for payments, but also spend it.  Cold storage is great for a savings portion, but as you hear the Winkelvosses say in this interview, their example is that they bought tickets to space with it. They explained how it is not like a stock, and they consider it as money: buying, selling, trading --putting it to work as a currency.

Yeah the charts are the same because they show the history of exchange rates, as well as buy and sell orders, etc.   Due to these similarities, the people who are accustomed to working with stock exchanges want to apply their familiar principles.  But I believe you are correct in thinking that Bitcoin performs differently from stocks and other commodities.  Primarily because it is an 'unregulated' open market

I would say that was a very wrong way to explain it.  There is no entity called 'Bitcoin' to give your money to.  I agree it's easy to say but it's just so wrong.  Most exchanges don't even take credit cards.

I don't really know for sure, but Coinbase does charge a bit of a premium for exchanges, and it may vary based on your country's currency (I am in the US).  That does seem pretty high.   Did you check GDAX?  It's an exchange owned by Coinbase and if you have a Coinbase account you are already signed up.  The exchange rates on GDAX are notoriously more reasonable.

Bitcoin is definitely undergoing growing pains right now.  There are two things I can say though:
* Nobody else is the custodian of your coin but you.  Your funds cannot be withheld or frozen by anyone, even though transaction times may be slow right now.
* There is no issuing authority which can decide to issue more at will.   The supply is finite, known, and controlled only by the software itself.

I agree it is very disappointing that Coinomi went to closed-source.  Their website boasts 'source available' and provides a link to the old github repository, which seems like it could be a bit misleading to the public, as well.  But in the end it is a full-featured, convenient, multi-coin and multi-wallet app, and I am glad they are adding Segwit.

If you are in the US, though, there are currently no fees with Shift, unless you withdraw cash.  I keep a little portion of my BTC on Coinbase as a working balance, and I use my Shift Card regularly, for daily expenses.  I have had it for about three years now and experienced no problems with it.  Of course I would prefer to send BTC directly to any merchant who will accept it, but until acceptance is wider I find that it is a good solution.

No one knows.  Use your intuition.  It definitely helps if you have the attitude that you can afford to lose whatever fiat you put into a BTC exchange.  If you wait to buy, the next dip could be higher than the current price.  Or you could buy now and then it will dip.

A long time ago I had heard Max Keiser talk about Bitcoin and how it will change the financial world, didn't do anything.  Then later after Silk Road got busted and then Mt Gox went bankrupt, the price went down but Bitcoin survived.  I finally took notice of the technology, started doing some research and decided to buy in:  I started an account on Coinbase and invested $100 when the price was about ^$600/BTC.  Right after that the price went down to around ^$200/BTC and stayed that low for about a year!  I had faith for some reason though, and gradually kept accumulating a little more coin at a time. I have also spent some when I needed to:  treating my BTC sort of like a savings account.  I am certainly still no millionaire, but the gains have been nice.

Yes, it appears to me that the mainstream financial PTB are going to be attempting to do the same type of manipulation.  They will try to convince sheeple that trading on their contracts is the same thing as buying actual BTC.  I read an article today that says soon you will not need to register with an unregulated exchange such as Coinbase to buy shares (yes they referred to BTC as 'shares').  It is about to become much easier to invest in Bitcoin when the CME makes its futures trading available.  
It is my understanding that this is how they fraudulently regulate the price of gold:  with the idea that owning a financial instrument labeled GLD is the same thing as actually owning the physical metal itself.

No one knows for sure what will happen to the exchange rates in the future, but Bitcoin is internet money, not necessarily a get-rich-quick scheme.  When I first bought some in 2014 it was about $600/BTC, and I lost over 50% when it went down to around $200.  It took over a year to recover, but it then went far beyond my expectations.  I would advise you to watch some youtube videos featuring Mr. Andreas Antonopolous it might make you feel better.

Yes Shift visa card draws from your Coinbase BTC wallet, you don't have to "preload," other than to keep some funds in Coinbase, which are not locked into the card but can also be spent directly as bitcoin.  The exchange to fiat $ is performed automatically at the time of sale.  I have had mine for 3 years now and use it almost daily.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:02:14
I think the values in that regard still are clear.  Yes, the network is congested, the mempool is full, fees are high.

It's not that much money, best bet is to leave it in the Coinbase account for now.  If you were moving a thousand or a million dollars worth, the fee would be the same.

Coinomi is also understandable and easy to use.  You can set your transaction fees too   Segwit addresses supported. In addition to multiple coins, one app can also handle multiple wallets of the same coin type.  Get a hardware solution or maybe even use paper for large balance wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:45:37
That is true with other cards such as BitPay, but with the Shift Card your card is backed by the Bitcoin balance in your Coinbase account.  The exchange into $ is not executed until you actually make a transaction with the card, so you realize btc value at the time of the sale.  And believe it or not, only the merchant pays fees, just like a regular Visa transaction.

Yes, because the fees are paid by the merchant and not the consumer, the general public is not even aware of the significant costs that the banking system imposes upon transactions.  The seller is forced to reflect these costs by raising the price on his/her products.  Further, because the bank industry can impose regulations and restrictions, they have now made it illegal to refuse small transactions, so if you accept credit cards you are forced to pay their high microtransaction rates.

Most likely you will be OK on Coinbase, but remember anyone can give advice-- no one can guarantee anything.  Depending on how much coin you have and how much you are willing to spend on transfers, there are many options.  (I have been using Coinomi wallet app, I don't have a hardware wallet yet)
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:23:52
If you are on the Coinbase website, you need to go to the security section and look up the 2FA seed code.  Write it down so that you can enter it in the authenticator app on your device.  You should also be able to look up or edit the phone number they have on file.

For all of its shortcomings, I must congratulate [Coinbase]( for having helped me to use Bitcoin as everyday money by providing support for the Shift Visa card, which performs free on-the-fly conversion to fiat at the point-of-sale.

 I dunno, for me it's just kind of a matter of principle.  If someone will accept bitcoin to buy something, I will often do it.  My gains in bitcoin value vs. USD have far exceeded my fees to date, so to me paying some transaction fee is really not a big deal.  The banks love to charge me fees (and interest) whenever they can so what's the difference?
@_date: 2019-11-08 16:55:30
Yeah loose vs. lose is a very common error in spelling. . But the two are seldom confused in spoken language.  The confusion is forgivable but also correctable.

Coinbase is an easy way to get a start.  Start small and learn how to transfer a balance out of the account they give you into another wallet. Then you are on your way to learning by doing.

1. your own conscience should be what stops you.
2. Exchanges that accept CC have strict KYC policies.  What would you do if you were running an exchange and someone did that to you?

Paper Wallet, 
Hardware Wallet. 
Full Node Client, 
"Hot" wallet (breadwallet, coinomi, copay, mycelium, etc. etc. ...)
...you have access to your own keys.

...you don't have your keys.

A personal story:  After I heard about bitcoin, I decided to look into it and visited bitcoin.org (as previous poster suggested).  I am in the western United States, so it seemed like the most accessible way to get into bitcoin was to open an account at Coinbase.  Coinbase will provide you with a wallet, but you do not hold your own keys to it.   I started by purchasing a very small amount of bitcoin, and learning how to move it into a hot wallet on my smartphone (yes there are some transaction fees involved but educatiion does not come without some cost).  I used copay but you could choose any wallet such as coinomi, breadwallet, or mycelium.  I also made some online purchases:  there are a few places that accept btc as payment.  After making some transactions and examining the details on a site such as blockchain.info, your understanding will increase greatly and you will begin to appreciate the jargon.  You may or may not want to stay with the same exchange you started with but now you will know what others are talking about when they express their opinions.
@_date: 2017-08-31 03:05:51
Coinbase may be OK and trustworthy but be aware you are getting access to a wallet owned by them not you. I like Coinomi on my phone, but you should use a hardware wallet for a larger amount like that.    Trezor or Ledger.  Or even a paper wallet maybe.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:43:03

I used shapeshift to dump part of my BCH into my BTC wallet, it works fine for simple transactions if you don't wanna sign up with a big exchange

coinbase has a "reports" section when you login to your account (on a computer, not on your phone).  It's currently in beta, but there you can create a report that will help you calculate your gains for tax purposes.
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:55:08
The problem with Coinbase is that if you have a problem, they do not have a good customer support program to help you:  it can take a long time to get your problem resolved and there is very little human communication.  Be aware of that and be careful.  Mostly, their service is good and it is not a scam.  They have many thousands of satisfied customers.
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:55:43
Yeah the recent dust has settled and you should use your coin as it is intended to be used-- push onward, through the fog!
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:08:45
Be careful with Coinbase.  Make absolutely sure that they know who you are and can trust you before making large transactions (credit cards seem to work best, although they charge extra for that).  Most of the troubles I have heard of are from people having difficulties getting their identities verified.  If you run into difficulties, there is no one at their customer support department to help you.  They say that they are working on the customer support staffing issue:  time will tell.  For the average beginner I still think Coinbase is a good way to test the water, then start transferring to your own wallet and learn to use other exchanges.

Coinbase gave me a Shift VISA card. I keep a portion of my BTC in a Coinbase account, and just use the card for purchases.  All the buying/selling is taken care of automatically and records are kept on the Coinbase website.  Whether you like Coinbase or not, you've got to admit that ' s pretty convenient.

I am not a financial expert, but maybe because you actually need, or have a really good reason to purchase, the goods or services you are spending it on.   A deflationary currency provides an incentive for savings, while inflationary currency lends itself to mindless consumerism and overextension of credit?

yeh, I got in at around $500, right after Mt Gox went down, thinking it was a good time because the price was low. Then it crashed even more, down to the 200's for almost a year during 2014-15.  For some reason I held on and even kept buying a little, meanwhile using it to make expenditures occassionaly.   ...I definitely did not know what I was doing but I am pretty happy about it right now,
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:38:35
Coinbase says this on its site:   "All digital currency that Coinbase holds online is fully insured. This means that if Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result."
Still, I prefer keeping the majority of my BTC in a wallet so that I hold my own keys.
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:11:36

I don't know, I have had mine since 2014 and they have not started charging fees yet.  The user experience for me has been great.  I have bought many things including gasoline, meals, groceries, paid my phone bill, veterinarian bill, etc. etc.   You are sent an immediate email confirming each transaction.  Your balance stays in your Coinbase wallet as BTC until you make a purchase.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:22:07
I also have a shift card, and use it regularly. Very convenient.
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:00:13


I understand what leads to this perception, but what percentage of the user space do you mean by "almost everyone?"  At this point it makes sense to hold more than to spend, because the price is going up, true.  There are many of us however who are using some of our bitcoin as currency nonetheless:  bitcoin-backed debit cards also help to facilitate this practice.  It is a beginning.

I guess I am an exception to the "old people" rule.  The dismissive skepticism you are describing is what I experience from people who are younger than I am.  I have lamented fiat money ever since I was a young man, when under the Nixon administration all the Silver Certificates were recalled in favor of the new Federal Reserve Notes.  I'm not a rich guy--  never been able to save or invest very much, and I have never trusted the Stock Market but when I heard about Bitcoin a few years ago I knew I had to have some!   Now I keep only a little fiat money in the bank.  Bitcoin has made me very happy so far.    
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:23:21


You are being confused intentionally.  There is no such thing as btc cash.  Bitcoin's ticker symbol is BTC, Bitcoin Cash is BCH.  To me, this is the point:  if BCH is superior to BTC, then it should be promoted solely on its merits, not by trying to confuse and conflate.   The sub r/btc is intentionally misnamed, it does not actually represent btc but rather, bch.

ACH does take a while but you still get the price locked in based on the time of your original transaction.  As far as 'fastest and cheapest' you may get a lot of different answers/opinions.  hint:  Hodl, yes.  But also use your coin to make purchases once in a while.  Then you can buy more to hodl.

Fees are charged only if you are obtaining cash at an ATM.  It works as either debit or credit for POS purchases.  The seller of course pays the usual VISA merchant fee and bank fees.

1.  The 'intrinsic value' behind any kind of money is that people who trade it agree on its value. That is all.
2.  Not everyone buys multiple currencies, but every BTC owner also acquired BCH and BTG when the respective forks occurred on the blockchain.
If you really are interested, and are willing to take a little risk, I would recommend that you go ahead and buy a small amount of coin in order to begin learning through experience.  It is the best way to increase your understanding.

The lesson here is to utilize GDAX/Coinbase only as an exchange, and then move your coin into your own wallet.  The thing that makes bank runs bad is that your bank doesn't actually have your money even though their phony ledger shows a balance under your name:  they have loaned it all out to others to earn interest for themselves.  It's called [fractional reserve banking](

It could be good if the price continues to increase, but it's risky, because there exists the possibility that bitcoin could go down in value or even crash severely.

I've had a little Bitcoin since 2014 when it was valued at only a few hundred dollars.  Hard to tell how much I've made, although my financial situation is actually still quite modest.  I have been keeping some spending money in Coinbase and using the Shift card for payments, while also holding out some savings in a private wallet.  I guess I will have to figure out my capital gains by April so I can report in on my income tax return.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:55:40
That will change in the future, it may require payment layers.  Right now I am making BTC-backed transactions using my Shift VISA card from Coinbase.  I can  use it virtually anywhere.  The merchant pays through VISA fees and Coinbase handles the exchange, making my transaction instant and free.  instead of paying a credit card statement I just buy more bitcoin.  Gasoline, groceries.... works great!
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:36:29
I personally think that Coinbase is making an attempt to be a responsible player in the crypto world.  On the other hand they are indeed involved in banking (complete with FDIC coverage), on the fiat side.  This is a necessary evil, and what we learned from Mt Gox is that we should not leave our precious funds in the custody of an exchange.  Less fear, more responsibility.
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:14:04
No I agree with you.  Certainly many have problems with Coinbase who are just genuinely attempting to use the services quite innocently.  Customer service for these people is all but non-existent.  But I don't think the people behind Coinbase are necessarily all bad either.  The AML/KYC stuff is for government compliance, and I agree it needs to be changed, but in the meantime the IRS and other agencies have been breathing down Coinbase's neck.  Coinbase could definitely be better but it is what it is. It's an individual's choice whether to use Coinbase.

Stocks have performed well with increasing value in recent years, but over the long term have been marked by periodic catastrophes.  When you buy stocks you are investing in companies and you are betting on those companies' performance.  The trouble is that stocks are also subject to artificial manipulation by the managements of those companies as well as by banksters and fraudsters.  Bitcoin is completely different, it is closer to buying a precious metal or even a commodity whose value is based upon supply and demand.  It can be used directly as money, unlike a stock.  The crypto supply is strictly regulated by a carefully written, open-source algorithm/protocol and is therefore quite reliable with relation to the demand side.  It has been a wild ride but in real terms has continued to gain value over the eleven years since inception.

Coinbase is pretty good.  Follow instructions carefully while signing up: if you mess things or have problems with the procedure you will have a bad time trying to get customer service/support.  Easy buys, sells and transfers once you get verified, but they do charge fees.  GDAX exchange is owned by Coinbase so you'll already be signed up for it, and you can switch to using GDAX, avoiding the fees once you know what you're doing.  Your money is FDIC insured and seems secure, but don't keep too much crypto in their wallet(s), transfer your coins to a private wallet so that you hold your own private keys.

@_date: 2017-11-11 22:16:02
Here is how I see it:  BTC is money whose value goes both up and down against your national currency.  If you get into a situation or emergency where you need money and your only alternative is to cash out some BTC, then that is what you must do.  I have been in this sort of situation myself:  maybe I missed out on some BTC gains, but I was glad to have the money to cover the emergency.  Overall I have still benefited from owning BTC.  I can't help you with the timing, though:  you must use your own intuition.

No mention of plastic cards?  I'm sure you also know that most fiat dollars ('real money' lol) exist only as conceptual numbers on digital network ledgers, with only a very small percentage printed on paper, right?  As I understand it, the primary differences being that fiat is under centralized control, their ledgers are not public, and fiat money is actually backed by the concept of unbridled debt rather than mathematical PoW for a finite supply.

Am I correct in thinking that perhaps there are many who were led to believe, rightly or wrongly, that the upcoming 2X increase in block size was to be an important "upgrade?"  Those people buying into BCH for big blocks, because 2X got scrapped, contributes to BCH price increase while BTC goes down?

In Coinbase's site, the "Reports" section is a set of tools which will generate and download a handy .csv spreadsheet file to assist you in calculating your capital gains/losses.  You then review the information for accuracy before submitting to the IRS.  Why would you want Coinbase to submit a 1099 directly to the IRS without giving you a chance to make sure it is accurate?

[**UPDATE the coin is now in my wallet, less than 24 hrs later.  Not quite instant, but did not create too much inconvenience for me:  thank you coinbase my faith is restored**]  I have had delays and glitches on Coinbase before, but it has been rare.  Just tried to buy some 0.12 BTC and got a message saying the transaction was successful:  however, no email notification and my wallet total does not reflect the new balance, which was supposed to be incremented by an "instant" buy.  If I go to the website under Tools &gt; History, I can see the buy and it says "completed."  There is a message on the support page saying that their staff is busy responding to an unusually high volume of support requests.  This makes one wonder what is going on, indeed.  Having the funds held mysteriously makes me a bit uncomfortable.   
@_date: 2017-04-21 03:04:37
Have been using coinbase for over two years.  Occasional delays in fund delivery to wallet, but all my exchange transactions have been solidly honored.  They also will provide a debit card that can be used almost anywhere for USD transactions and purchases.

Full faith and credit of the US government? The fact is that USD is issued by the Federal Reserve which is a private bank, it is backed only by debt, and is loaned to the US government with Interest due. Research for yourself and learn.
@_date: 2018-11-09 23:12:37
You're supposed to keep track of the BTC that you buy, and what it costs you at the time you buy it, as well as how much you sell (or spend) and its value at the time you sold (or spent) it.  Then you are supposed to calculate your capital gain (or loss) in USD and report that to the IRS.  It can get a little complicated but there are apps and tools that can be used to make the calculation.  If you are talking about only 2018 the exchange rate has decreased during much of the year, so you might actually show a loss, which could potentially decrease the amount of income tax you owe.

Exchanges that deal with fiat money must observe government and banking regulations:  AML=anti-money-laundering, and KYC=know-your-customer.

Bitcoin can be very volatile when held up against other currencies.  This has been demonstrated many times over the past years.  Bitcoin is a protocol, a new technical development.  What it is not is a stock tied to a company's performance, nor is it a tangible commodity.  It therefore defies comparison, and is difficult to descfibe in traditional terms of a 'market.'
@_date: 2018-03-20 03:32:57
the sky is falling!....
@_date: 2018-03-06 21:55:10
I actually like this post, obvious and circular as it may seem to be:  I have often received criticism that using my Shift VISA Card for purchasing goods or service is not really 'spending' my BTC for the purchase, but rather 'selling' or 'trading' my BTC for USD at the time of sale.  But I contend that my BTC is, nonetheless, involved in the transaction.  So I want to continue to consider that I am 'spending' my bitcoin on things, even though the merchant that I purchase from receives his/her payment in fiat.  I would prefer to seek merchants that would accept BTC directly, but they are few and far between, and even then. many of those who do accept BTC use a payment processing service that performs an exchange at the time of sale anyway.  I regard it as an intermediate step toward more acceptance and adoption.

This line makes me a bit suspcious.  Shares???  BTC is not a stock.  I am sorry for you; however, you admit that you did not access the account for like, a year or so?  And, you replaced your laptop and phone without properly transferring your authentication credentials.  Now you are blaming Coinbase for not being able to easily re-access your account.  I am aware that a number of people have issues, and say that Coinbase's customer service is bad (or almost non-existent):  --but it is also your responsibility to keep you security credentials up-to-date.  Keep trying:  I wish you the best of luck if your story is true.  If you were using a private wallet and did not back up your access code/private key, you would be completely out of luck.  Hopefully Coinbase will come through for you eventually.  *Disclosure: I have not (yet) had any major problems with Coinbase and I am not a hater.*

I am tired of people telling me about Bitcoin's slow and expensive transactions as compared to the banking industry's payment systems.  Each time I accept a plastic card at my business, I pay a fee to the bankers. That fee is even more significant for smaller transactions, and according to banking regulations it is 'illegal' for me to establish a minimum purchase amount for card use.  Even if I do not make any credit card transactions for an entire month, there is a 'minimum' fee that I must pay.  Also, it takes at least 48 hours before the funds are deposited, by daily batches, into my bank account.  The purchaser may not be aware that the transaction is slow and expensive, but the merchant is forced to pass the cost along to him/her in the form of higher prices.

I have a Shift VISA Card from Coinbase, (but no experience with any others so I can't call it a 'favorite.') You keep a balance in their online wallet, and then your BTC is exchanged automatically when you use the card.

"Currency should be liquid and easily convertible in value to distinguish what something is worth. Of course inflation occurs and it's value changes with other markets but it is relatively liquid and safe.
It will be very hard to make bitcoin purchases main stream when it is so volatile. Bitcoin just recently hit $5,000 but is currently trading at around $4,400. If i bought a TV right now for 1 bitcoin and tomorrow the price rises to $5000 (which it very likely could) i actually lose money in that deal and the company i bought the TV from has now made even more off of me than just the sale price."
I carry a debit card which allows me to make my bitcoin instantly liquid for use in making purchases almost anywhere, which I often do when I am running low on fiat dollars (I do however try to replace the bitcoin as soon as possible to maintain the investment aspect of my holdings.)  Maybe that puts me in your 10-20% minority.
Here's another scenario involving a TV set:  what if I buy a TV one day for $800, and then the next day the store decides to put that same model 'on sale' for $495?  I would feel like I lost money on that deal, in much the same way that you describe.

If you have money in a Coinbase "wallet,"  you don't have any keys.  Coinbase is storing your BTC similarly to the way a bank would hold your money for you.  To hold your own keys to your funds you need to create your own "wallet" using some kind of software/hardware (such as the mycelium app on your smartphone or perhaps a Trezor as a couple of examples), and then send your BTC from Coinbase to an address generated by your new wallet.  You can now access those funds directly on the blockchain using a variety of different "wallet" types (or applications). Your public key can be used to locate your wallet on the blockchain but not to access it.  Your private key will not be stored online, but you can retrieve it from within your device or by decoding a passphrase.  Keep securely and do not lose your private key information!

It's not completely dumb to have your funds in a Coinbase account, so long as you trust them and they don't get hacked or anything like that.  For you to really be able to call your coin your own, though, you should have a wallet for which you control your own keys.  The most secure way is to write your public and private keys down somewhere offline, and keep them safe so no one else can see them. That is what we call a "paper wallet."
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:50:14
You don't "make" money.  Money is supposed to be earned not made.  That's the trouble:  banks in collusion with governments make fiat money and they make all they want.  Money with any real basis (e.g. bitcoin, gold, silver, etc.) must be earned or somehow "mined," and its quantity is limited.

I heard about Bitcoin when it first started, although I didn't own any for about five years.  There is no next best thing to Bitcoin.  I bought in because it's money, currency, a store of value, and an investment.  It is not just created out of thin air, it takes computational work to create.  It's not controlled by a government and/or banks, so no one can take it away from you:  although its value can fluctuate like anything else.

How do you know this?  It may very well be true, however you should not disregard that there exists a number of people who use bitcoin (and perhaps other cryptos) in their daily lives as a store of value and/or medium of exchange for goods and services.  Those people probably do not spend their time online discussing price, charts, dips, moons, hodl, etc., so the existence of these users is outside of your awareness.  Remember that the technology is global in nature and not confined to people in your own country. If you are in a place like the United States you are constantly deluged by media reports and discussions which treat Bitcoin like a stock or commodity, and do not ever mention that it was originally devised to be a form of currency.

Coinbase has never been hacked yet and they seem to maintain solid security, but remember that you are trusting them completely with the custody of your funds.
It is good to learn about controlling your own funds by downloading a wallet to your phone or computer (such as electrum, breadwallet, mycelium, coinomi, et. al.) and transferring some coin to and from it, although experimentation will cost you some transaction fees.
  --If you want to learn even more and you have a good computer which is always online you can even put your wallet on your own full node, but that is beyond a lot of people.   
A hardware wallet stores your keys in a removable format so they are not held within your computer or device and therefore less subject to potential hacks.

THis argument is all about definition.  The most common definition for fiat currency is that it is given its value by decree:  generally that means government decree.  But money is really just anything that two or more people agree upon as a form of exchange, and if you argue that those two people decree something as money between them, then all forms of money could be spoken of as fiat.  The word fiat just means *let it be done*,  So bitcoin is decreed to be money by the people who believe in it, or perhaps the Satoshi White Paper could be considered the decree.  I am fine with that:  but in my own language I intend to continue to refer to *government decreed money* as fiat, because that seems to be the most agreed upon definition.

Google may have started out "neutral,"  but it is controlled by a central authority, and is now being redesigned to reduce/eliminate that neutrality  In my view, that's part of what were up against now as a society, and why it is important that Bitcoin remain open-source and decentralized.

Nothing really tangible or material is behind bitcoin, that is true.  However, the computational power that is put into solving the cryptographic math problems, generating the blockchain, is real work that uses energy and resources, and that does give it intrinsic value.

Yes, the mnemonic phrase can be decoded to obtain your private key.  Losing your keys (or having them stolen or discovered) is always a risk.  I don't think there is really any consensus.  You can even write down both a public and a private key on a piece of paper and keep the "paper wallet" in a secure place like a safe for long term storage:  that would be absolutely secure against electronic hacking.  Still, the paper could possibly get lost, burned or stolen.....

Getting a Shift VISA from Coinbase, enables you to keep a small portion of your BTC in a Coinbase wallet and use it for immediate purchases anywhere, this is useful because few places actually accept Bitcoin  (Coinbase automatically exchanges BTC to cover the fiat VISA transaction.)  When it's appropriate, I like to let the merchant know what i'm doing and that if he accepted BTC directly he would be saving the VISA merchant fees.

You need to keep some coin in a Coinbase wallet to cover your card use.  Bitcoin is exchanged on the fly and a VISA transaction is created.  Not really newly established:   I have had one for several years, and it is very convenient.  It works as a debit card too so you can get cash at ATM's (with a fee.)

Yes for me, this.  I like keeping my money stored as BTC.  In order to use it as currency I usually have to convert it back to USD first, but no matter, I look forward to wider acceptance.  Keeping fiat stored in a bank does not make me feel good.  An increase in stored value is a side benefit, and I really appreciate it.
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:27:46
You are engaging in fallacious thinking when you say that you lost money by spending bitcoin.  You actually just used the value of the coin at the time of the purchase.  If you have fiat money to purchase replacement bitcoin, nothing is really lost.
With the same line of reasoning I could say that I lost millions by keeping any fiat money in the bank, and not using all of it to buy bitcoin.
If I put 100% of my money in bitcoin I would have no choice but to spend it on purchases.

Yeah the shift card I think is the best solution for the time being, it makes bitcoin-based payments on the fly with no waiting but it does indeed involve middleman parties, including Coinbase and the VISA network.  You need to keep some coin in a Coinbase wallet to cover your purchases but it does not get exchanged into fiat until you make a purchase.
Other payment layers such as the lightning network are being developed but in some aspects this is also a middleman-based approach.

Of course you can keep bitcoins in a Coinbase wallet, but they hold the encryption keys and do all the transactions for you, on your behalf.

When people ask questions such as this OP, I would really like to see some more substantive answers.  Recommending particular wallet software with no given reasons why, or condemning wallets with flat comments like "...tend to be insecure," is not really helpful.   Do the respondents even know what makes a wallet more or less advantageous, or are they just spouting brand recognition and opinion?  Notwithstanding that, I agree that a windows environment is probably not a great place for your private keys to reside in (the reasoning behind this is well-known).

I think it was about $1 when I first heard about it.  My first experience was to install a full node on my linux machine.  I never actually obtained any BTC until much later though, after the Mt Gox debacle, when it was about $600.  Then it slid down to about $200 for awhile.

phone wallets such as electrum, copay, breadwallet, coinomi, mycelium, et al (and I think also samourai) are not that bad.  They do let you control your own keys.  Make sure that your wallet app keeps your keys only on your phone, with no other copies.  Usually you are provided with a mnemonic "seed phrase" of 12-24 words that can be decoded to unlock your private key--safeguard your key backup information with a written copy in a secure place (or memorize it) and don't let anyone see it.  It is true that hardware wallets are even more secure, but storing coin using an online wallet such as coinbase means you do not have your private key.
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:36:04
There are many Coinbase haters, but I really think that the Shift card is a great feature, I just keep a small portion of my coin in a coinbase wallet and I can use it for transactions anywhere no matter how small.

Not a complete list by any means.  Notably missing is the Metropolitan Commercial Bank,  the bank standing behind the Shift VISA Card, which links to Coinbase exchange and allows you to convert BTC to USD on the fly at the time of purchase.  I'd say that is about as crypto-friendly as any bank gets.
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:55:54
You're likely to get diverse opinions.  Back up your actions with prior research and think for yourself.  Personally I treat my BTC like savings.  Buy, hodl, and only sell when I get in a bind or need to make an important purchase.  You can use a phone wallet, but a dedicated hardware wallet is better.  Just make sure you keep your private keys written down/stored somewhere safe.

These "Anti Money Laundering/Know Your Customer" (AML/KYC) regulations have been increasing creepingly and incrementally over several years.

Some banks now will not let you deposit amounts of cash into your checking or savings account until you fill out a form detailing how you got it.  Supposedly it is to stop terrorism or something like that--  Keeping you safe = loss of freedom.  It's not just in the USA either.

If you can stomach the idea of keeping some BTC balance in a Coinbase account, then the Shift Card is the way to go, (provided you are in an eligible location).  It is the only card that automatically performs a BTC/USD exchange 'on the fly,' at the time of purchase.

That's right, and the $20 is a one-time fee:  I just got my replacement card in the mail as the first one reached its expiration date.  So far, my card has been free to use (unless you are withdrawing Cash at an ATM, in that case there is a fee).  You just have to maintain an available BTC balance in your Coinbase account for the card to draw from.  Keep in mind that the VISA system derives its profit by assessing USD fees to the merchant.  Works like a charm.

I have made many purchases from [Overstock.com]( using bitcoin as well, and have never had problems.  However, network errors and such things are always possible and I would personally give them benefit of the doubt.  The story about the customer service agent is not too surprising, considering that most likely only a small portion of business is conducted using BTC, and problems are rare, so the agent lacked experience and thus did not know much about it.  It's a sign that their employee training is a bit deficient in this category.  Like you say, amusing but not really...
