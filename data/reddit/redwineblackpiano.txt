If it's entirely your own choice why not simply buy etf and etn's directly ?

Still baffles me since I would expect a pension fund to offer only 'safe' choices so I guess some solidness is attributed to crypto. Or should I say bitcoin ? Do they include a portion of altcoins in your portfolio ̂?

Are you telling that pension funds nowadays already invest in crypto?? That's mind blowing!
@_date: 2019-07-25 00:16:08
I  hope the other way around ! Would be fantastic if stocks could trade 24/7 as well.

I started with an ETN as well but switched to the real stuff soon to avoid costs. Had a TER of 2.5% which I found excessive.

Nobody can patent technology that already exists, especially open source tech. It's called 'prior art' .

I do hope you are right but I want to stay realistic...a lot of attention has gone to bitcoin recently so it might phase out a little bit in the near future.

Mmm that makes sense never thought about it this way. Thanks for the great insight! So I guess we are in stage 4 right now?

Like Warren Buffett describes gold: it just sits there    looking at you. Only difference is bitcoin is still climbing it's way to become gold 2.0

Buy a new alarm clock. Nobody should be allowed to sleep in that long.

I think that's step 1

The by then 40 billion hodlers will be very frustrated:-) And that includes my grand-grand-grand son.

Let's verify - upvote if you're green, downvote if red.

I believe this is very true, I just wonder about the mechanics behind step 2.

Very happy with bitvavo but that's EU, Netherlands. Very low fee, good website.

Might be higher I think. It's a number that only can increase!
@_date: 2019-12-29 05:04:29
Not really.  Gold supply is not capped like bitcoin.

What is mass adoption supposed to mean by the way?  Adoption is now max 0.5% of world population. My investment is good if that would reach 5%.

Well there are decent estmates- 18 M total 3 M lost. But how will these figures look like 10 years from now?
@_date: 2019-12-29 04:22:00
Exactly and there's no price model that takes this into account- at least not that I know off.
