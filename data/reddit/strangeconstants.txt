that's the only question left in this debacle.

I'd rather have the truth of the matter. And you're almost trivializing the genius that went into the original implementation which is why nothing turned into something that "belongs to all of us now".

He needs 6 months to come up with a more convincing con for the bitcoin community.

Why is that any reason to think CW could be SN? That's also a trivial point. Of course whoever has the current keys to a wallet controls said wallet.

Your last point is underrated. Satoshi cannot just be anyone. It takes a certain type of character to create a brilliant system, completely disappear, have it attain the value of millions of dollars, and still be able to maintain anonymity in the first place, etc.

His is like shit, coming from an actual physicist.

New laptop that Wright provided.
@_date: 2016-05-08 18:16:36
sadly you're wrong.

Everything would make more sense if Craig Wright's real title was actually Dr. Snuggles of the Tulip Trust island in the clouds.

Why should anyone trust your opinion on the matter? Last post I saw from you, you argued that CW could be Satoshi (with all the counter evidence already available) while also admitting that you hadn't even looked into the matter deeply.

Finally went through last night.

What supercomputers?

Writing bitcoin as bit coin is strong.

You're wrong in that it is logic, probabilistic logic, that dictates that CW is most certainly not Satoshi, and that logic, whether you realize it or not, is where every sentiment you hold on the matter stems from. Why haven't you considered the fact that CW is not actually a time traveler from the future or an extraterrestrial? Why are these not in the debate? Because logically there are valid, just incredibly improbable. It's your lack of acuity on the matter to not understand it's incredibly unlikely CW and SN are the same person, even part of the same team, from everything we know of SN.

THAT'S your reasoning?

Except the investigators weren't. Everything he's done to garner attention has been of his own volition.

I've been waiting 26+ fuckin hours.

Needs to pay bills? God forbid he touched any of the millions of btc he mined.

hilarious.
