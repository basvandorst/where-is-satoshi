I tried that but It appears I am using the incorrect path therefore I cannot see the address. What path should I use?

yes I did, I actually attempted every possible path generating over 1500 addresses in each in hopes of finding the address to no success.

We will be doing this moving forward.

the thing is we continued to use the same xpub and api key for 2 weeks after the incident and generated many addresses and did a few large test trades longside debugging what happened with this particular trade, as well as tested our fixes to prevent it from happening again so a hack like mentioned in OP was unlikely, as the BTC sat in the wallet for almost a month and when it did leave it went into a address with a very very large holding of 14000 bitcoins + .

As mentioned in the OP The mistake was on my side for not implementing the gap limit as well as not using a full node on my server. Which is understandable why now. However this is not my current issue as I have resolved the issue which lead to my problem now.
I wrote off the BTC as a loss due to my stupidity and accepted it until recently when the Bitcoins moved. I then made this thread because it was now clear that the funds have moved and my mistake is now someone elses profit due to them ignoring my requests for help. My intention is to get in contact with [Blockchain.com]( and resolve the mistake so I can move on as well.

Yes we are aware of this but used the API as it was easy to implement during beta testing to create the proof of concept.

I attempted using this site to no success when the coins were still in the address. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 19:06:29
Prior to this it was working fine. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 16:35:45
As the address did not show on my Blockchain account I could not access it. I did however test and successfully access other addresses private key but only with addresses that fell within the 20 gap\_limit.

I did not get my coins back. They ended up in a wallet address with over 14k BTC in it. I assume this is blockchain.coms wallet so yeah they stole it 
@_date: 2018-09-05 16:33:08
I did attempt this but found no success. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 21:13:21
I am considering this 
@_date: 2018-09-05 17:08:28
It is wrong for such a large service such as [Blockchain.com]( to ignore their users and have selective support. People need to know what happened and what they are doing about it in hopes of someone in my shoes learning from this. 
I also want my bitcoins back as it was clear now that they have moved that they are accessible 
@_date: 2018-09-05 17:37:08
I appreciate all the criticizing comments suggesting what I should of done before the coins moved but I assure you I attempted all recommended methods to recover the coins to the best of my ability. At the end of the day the coins have moved and they were potentially moved on purpose or by procedure by a wallet provider that should of assisted me in recovering them in the first place. They need to see this. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 21:15:02
they are using a weird path because I still attempted to access the address after the funds moved. Used every path I could find and couldnt not get the address
@_date: 2018-09-05 22:40:01
I paid out to all 20 unused addresses that contributed to exceeding the gap limit. So therefore moving forward all addresses generated where within the gap limit well the address that got generated beyond the gap\_limit was not scanned my blockchain.coms server and therefore never ended up in my wallet

Thank you!

Localbitcoins replied to my support ticket with the following.
'Hello!  We have received reports of few unauthorised transactions. That is why we had to temporarily disable outgoing bitcoin transactions to investigate the issue.   Right now outgoing transactions have been enabled again. Everything should work normally!  Our apologies due to inconvenience!  --- Best regards, LocalBitcoins '

Will something like this solve our problem and provide a solution?
