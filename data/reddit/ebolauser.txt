Why do you think so ? You are getting a paid service for free. Whats
more you dont have any way to not accept it other than to stop
using your account. You had better put it on your taxes.

I agree the electrum mnemonic is a better design overall.
BIP39's only advantage is that you cannot choose your own words,
while almost any electrum word choices are valid.
bip39's overspecified unicode, and unneeded pbkdf step are silly, imo.

not good enough

A bip-38 paper wallet doesnt fit in your memory. And it reveals the public key, so you cant deny the coin's existence. 
A 12-word memorized trezor mnemonic OTOH, even if you dont own a trezor, is a great way to store cold coins with no physical artifacts and no risk of theft.

This is largely solved. BIP39 essentially makes it impossible for the user to select their own password. With a minimum of 12 words, computer generated passwords will be strong, while remaining easy to memorize.
The use of BIP44 wallets, such as mycelium, trezor, and others, enables a human to easily memorize their password.
2FA, and other weak passwords and auth schemes are irrelevant ancient history for holding bitcoin.

SSL is only secure as every countries root registrars. 
You cant count on SSL in the case of bitcoin, imo.

code may come, but i think the btc core developers see it as a dead end. same as treechains
@_date: 2014-10-23 20:05:07
its not bad advice perse, but i think an offline electrum is easy enough for anyone, and way more secure. so instead of a 35 character passphrase, a 12 word passphrase, etc
@_date: 2015-01-29 13:35:10
closed code is dead code. 
People choose to use open source, and this is a huge mistake for TREZOR; they are no longer the good guys.
As of 1 day ago I was a huge trezor fan. not anymore, now i will recommend bwallet to everyone.
@_date: 2015-01-29 16:38:35
I was planning to buy them for my whole family...
I was with you and your defense of the attacks the ledger guys are making.. but now ... I cant support you anymore.
no better than mycelium, exactly.  Now I have to say "dont put anything in there unless you can afford to lose it", just like mycelium.
such a waste. Its like you want to push us to bwallet. And I hated them yesterday.

It also doesnt prove real ownership of the coins, only the ability to obtain a signature. 
If I had 100K bitcoins I could make a handy living selling signatures of my coins between tumblings to sketchy exchanges wanting fake proof of reserve. 
There is also a technique to do a rolling proof of reserve, wherein you only release enough information to prove part of the total amount before the next proof releases.

its no longer open, as being able to make clones is exactly what makes open code good. 
ledger isnt the same thing, its a retardo-product, might as well use electrum alone if I have to trust the pc.
If you dont get it, you dont get it. Its the ability to make and change and re-release that makes software open. If trezor closes it down, they are done. bitcoin is a free software ecosystem.

Thank you for the response and I also understand your position and your investment into smartcards. 
In my opintion, smartcards are not truly secure due to obscurity or ndas. No crypto system benefit from that, as it is strictly weakening in effect. It is guaranteed that that information has leaked out, and their value is in resisting market competition not security.
The value of the smart-card is strong design review, resistance to power and timing attacks, and so on.
having all the signatures and crpyto operations work in constant time and constant power, combined with a bit of shielding and tamper resistance, and clean control of power so the device is 100% on or 100% off, and you should have all the same benefits.
I know its not your wheelhouse, but a fully auditable device with these features would be far superior to a vague trust of an unknown.
For example: PIN security using a constant time AES encrypt, and haivng the validaiton of pass fail be external, means there is no physical attack on the PIN code.

thats fair. but the main point of not writing anything down may be:
leaving no signs that a wallet exists at all. 
or not being able to carry anything with you.

Stellar is a scamcoin, same crooks as ripple

this is not true; They are currently completely vulnerable to pc's, and not safe to use. Supposedly they are working on a new verison to give at least 2FA, but thats still in the future and nowhere near as good as a self contained device. plus with all the closed source it can never be trusted.
I hate it but bwallet is now the best option out there.
@_date: 2015-01-29 15:21:03
open source / free software is a reality of the future, and companies will have to find a way to make money in this model. closed source will not work, regardless of the challenges to preventing clones.
I too want to see trezor and their team be profitable, but that does not mean that the community can afford to go closed. bitcoin is fundamentally a free software ecosystem.
@_date: 2015-01-29 15:39:14


please consider putting a front end on the device, like a screen and button. I dont understand the point of a hardware wallet without that. 
Also, the closed source stuff is bad juju. 
Closed source means its no better than the new trezor. not having an interface means its not stand alone.
@_date: 2015-01-29 16:05:32


Its not good vs evil, its about the future vs the past. 
Tying in the a legacy closed model is a strategic mistake. 
I do see the advantages in a secure hardware design, but that does not justify going closed source.
As a consumer, I wont use closed source stuff anytime I get a choice. As an advocate, I will steer everyone I know towards free and open source bitcoin options.


that is a great step forward. Please consider what can be done to get freerer hardware or at least free all the control software. If you can do that, you will have me at your back and I will gladly advocate for your product.

Why do you think so? I think miner's will sell more and hold less when the price is low, and hold more and sell less when the price is high or rising. 
So I suspect miner profitability has a very small effect on overall price, and primarily has a small trend-reinforcing nature. (mining profit has a larger effect on security strength tho)
I think price is strictly based on the user network: 
more people who accept bitcoin in exchange for their labor, product, and services increase the value/demand equilibrium. Most especially, those users who only accept bitcoin for services and products and hold liquid assets in bitcoin affect the value. long hold speculation and value storers also matters. 
people who use bitcoin only for transport and hold none of it dont affect the price much.

bitcoin is a sign of things to come; distributed p2p secure services.
I hope you understand the implications for copyright. I'd suggest releasing early in small increments, building a following, then using a bitcoin kickstarter model.

It seems like a part of the reason is that the electrum guys wanted transparent backwards compatibility with their (very nice) older mnemonic standard.
While I understand the reasoning on the new electrum standard (ability to checksum without the word-list) I dont think it was valuable enough to break compatibility. Silly choice.

correct; Direct merchant acceptance of bitcoin is less important than bitcoin denominated acceptance. 
Today we have it backwards: Merchant wants Fiat, but will accept value over the blockchain.
The future will be that the merchant wants satoshis, but will accept value from a number of OBC companies (bitpay,visa, mastercard) 
for larger purchases they may also accept direct blockchain transactions with a 1 hour confirmation hold.

Electrum's model is the right one.
you do need to create a new wallet for each new relationship.
A multi-sig wallet is a combination of client-vendor-arbitrator.
Each of the three should create a new root key to combine together. And to move coins from the new wallet, at least two of the three need to collaborate.

if people can pay their major expenses, food, rent, clothing, directly with bitcoin, the the entire concept of "remittance" ceases to exist.
rather than remitting money, you could pay their bills directly from overseas.

FWIW, this is my highest desire for trezor. 
stronger ecdsa implementation. stronger pin implementation.

make it resistant to a total disassembly of the device and raw flash access.
