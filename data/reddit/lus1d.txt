I bought 1 btc in 2013 for long term strategy and lost 0. 4 in day trades on the first day, just playing. My primary advice would be buy whenever you like and then hide it in a wallet and don’t touch it no matter what happens until you pre determined goal is reached. My secondary advice is the same as above, except wait a week before buying cos it’s gonna dive. But what’re happens now is going to pale into insignificance against the rise over the next decade

I would advise assuming that anything you type into your computer is not private. Ensure you use 2FA or MFA or you may as well post your passwords here. If you use a paper wallet do not link it to blockchain.info or you may as well post your private  key here.
I made a paper wallet on a pc booted from portable Ubuntu USB, printed then emptied printer cache. Then like the noob I was I linked my wallet with Blockchain.info instead of just sending btc to it, and my blockchain.info account was hacked. Then I gave it up despondently, but awakened by the last surge I am now looking at hardware wallets. I don’t know about GDAX, but I do know I suck a trading, so I’m gonna wait for funds to clear in my exchange, buy as much as I can afford to lose next week, securely store then forget about for 5-10. Probably buy $100 a week and keep topping up to my hardware wallet, maybe in btc or maybe in alt. Probably btc though.
I was listening to podcasts in 2013 advising to invest $100 or $50 or $20 a month. I reckon the advise still stands strong. Just be rock solid on security. Core filled brickwork steel reinforced with tied footings, primed, membrane sealed, epoxy coated tight on security. Protect yourself against everything from script kiddies to Russian hackers to girlfriends to piping wielding gangsters. Cos the culture of crypto is there is no ownership of keys. If you lose it you deserved to lose it.

I thought I had 0.4 btc sagely stowed in the paper wallet. I checked yesterday but looks like I lost it? Is this 1 transaction cleaning me out a few days after I made it? Why isn’t it all gone? I’m confused I must admit because I’m not sure how to read the above.
I did make paper wallets as Chrissy cards to give to the family, but I thought I never transferred to them. So I’m unsure if I did put btc in the paper wallets now. There seem to be some transactions Chrissy eve. 
Edit- clicking through it looks like .35 btc ended up in a wallet that had 2999 btc in it. So I’m gathering either I was hacked or maybe I moved it out and into an exchange. But the only exchange I used was btc-e, and that website looks like the US feds have closed it down

Correct, I’m asking for assistance in making sense of the transactions out of that wallet. I don’t know how to interpret that link to my public wallet address. Is it saying 0.35 was moved out on dec 18th, then 3 smaller transactions happened on the dec 24th? Or were the 3 smaller ones fees for verifying transactions?
The rest of the story was a bit of background context for interest sake. Call it transactional, a bit of entertainment in exchange for help with reading that link.

Thank you very much. The .35 went out to an address which had .35 in . 35 out. The following address it went to had 2999 deposits to it totalling 277,000 bitcoins deposited. I googled the public key  and found this link: 
So at that time I, along with a crap load of other people, were hacked, the the value of what looks like would now be worth about $5.5 billion. 
I think what happened was I made a blockchain.info wallet, then moved my btc out of that into a paper wallet. But I messed up and linked the paper wallet to the blockchain.info wallet, because when I logged in today for the first time in 4 years I could see that I could transfer out of the paper wallet using the blockchain.info wallet. I put the private key for my paper wallet in blockchain.info wallet.
When I first set up I didn’t use 2FA. I heard about it, then I went back and set up 2FA a week later but had already been hacked. I must have had loggers or some malware from the dodgy utorrent warez that got my blockchain.info passwords. Searching gmail I see I had another unauthorised login attempt in 2016. Maybe the same data file with my passwords sold on years later or maybe the same dickwad trying again.
Cheap lesson really, could hv been a lot worse. 
I just got out at $23000 and and into ether. Will wait till it settles in the next few days, invest a bit more and swap back and check in another few years. After this I think I’ll invest in a hardware wallet and paper wallets and be careful about not linking it to any website.
I thought I was so goddam thorough with 2FA, paper wallets made offline from portable Ubuntu boot and I still managed to leave myself exposed.

All my bitcoin? Nope, just what was in that paper wallet. Strange that it apparently ain’t as secure as the coins in the exchange. And I gave a paper wallet to each of my siblings with the intent to load them, back in 2013. We always hand make Chrissy cards for each other. It’s kind of an artistic oneupmanship. I don’t follow your rational about hating at Christmas time. We just laugh and eat too much.
I was actually hoping for advice on how to read the Blockchain and confirmation that there was 1 transaction out, and what looks like some minor movements out, maybe be to pay for the mining verification? But I don’t get the dates....

What are your thought on the projection that miners will need the power consumption of USA by 2020 to maintain bitcoin?
