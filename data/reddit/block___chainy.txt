Do you want all your history checked while they reveal NONE of theirs? 
Do you want a currency that inflates every 10 years to half its value while 8 families can print whatever they want?
Do you want to be audited yearly while they are never audited?
Do you want to pay 1%, 5%, 20% or even 30% wire fees just to send money across a National border while crypto has pennies max for each transfer?
Do you enjoy them laughing at people they consider dangerous for no reason and instantly every dollar they own is confiscated and vanishes into thin air?  Want the solution where they have no power to remove transactions and info off a blockchain ledger?  And right now bitcoin is by far the safest and largest international ledger that no government could take down unless they literally cut cables at every home and business on earth 
I’ve got about 90 other questions with obvious answers that mean danger and risk for you while THEY get away with murder.
Seeing a pattern?

So 5x new users and then 70% selloff wew lad
I see the new growth as less FOMO and that’s why we’re seeing less and less volatility each time.  People legit need it as a currency now to even survive in some situations 
It isn’t just a fad anymore

Great question.  An acquaintance of mine over there wanted money and they asked to use moneygram.  FUCK NO.  30% fee hell no.

Relax.  Whites are literally the smallest global minority race on the planet and the fact you don’t know that proves the anti ‘anything white’ indoctrination machine you see 24/7 is working perfectly
The fact that 25-30% of the population is acutely aware of that and doing something in their own self interest despite the mass migrations and takeovers of their cultures and homelands doesn’t make them ‘bigots’.   
Doesn’t matter.  Everything is a racist and everyone is a bigot.  Just turn on the tv for 30 seconds and you find that out real fast and it’s a meaningless assault now.

ok.  similar to a stop loss on a stock losing value (I've done that before) so on a SHORT you're setting the price higher at the stop loss so you don't lose money in the future.

thank you.  another retard question.  
if i short 1 bitcoin at $80 and the price is $100 and it liquidates at $120, that means i OWE the exchange $20 sorta?  what happens if i can't pay it?  why did it liquidate at $120?  some prearranged price?

Elonoshi has a better ring to it

Good lord.  Exactly.  And nobody can read a fucking time chart apparently either.  WW2 would be in the middle around mid 40's for the USA not in the fucking 1920s

Thats not the variable in this discussion. 
Regardless of USD/BTC current values, 30,000 BTC can be sold nearly instantaneously across a few exchanges world wide in a matter of minutes and ‘every exchange would shut down’ did not happen as was theorized.

12 billion market cap drop in literally a couple hundred seconds.
@_date: 2019-08-26 02:34:41
