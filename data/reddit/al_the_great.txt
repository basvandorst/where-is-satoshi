A hub and spoke model I think would be most efficient, and the way lightning is designed, you don't have to trust the person you've opened up a channel with. I think network topography for lightning is a very overblown concern.

Great post. BTC is about much more than getting people rich by holding. I think the biggest threat to BTC is the establishment trying to crack down, like the IRS' fishing expedition of Coinbase users, as if BTC is the locus of tax evasion in the U.S.

It seemed to me like they were telling their users to upgrade to segwit-compatible code, which BTC1 is. It's also 2X compatible which they publicly support. I don't agree with this move, it seems to me like a way of trying to shut down segwit2x supporters.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:42:27
Legal action? That's not what Bitcoin is about.
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:03:19
This is actually pretty eye opening. I've learned a lot about Bitcoin so I know the article is trash. But what other trash have I read and thought was true?

@_date: 2017-08-18 21:01:23
BTC1 has segwit. The only difference between the core and BTC1 nodes will come if there's a hard fork. If BitPay believes there will be a successful 2x hard fork, then it's reasonable for them to suggest this.

I like it!
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:07:55
It's no secret BitPay supports the NYA. And BTC1 nodes are implementing segwit. It could have been worded better, but doesn't seem scandalous to me.
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:00:15
Which I do assume ;)
@_date: 2017-08-06 22:01:07
I would emphasize the fees. If the business handles the Bitcoin transfers themselves, all the fees are paid by the purchaser. That's a win for the business, who is likely used to paying credit card fees themselves.
I would probably also mention a payment processor like BitPay, who I believe will settle Bitcoin payments in fiat for 1% (better than credit cards).
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:36:32
I think we're not giving enough weight to the fact that fees are so high. To open and close a lightning network channel will involve 2 on-chain transactions. People won't want to pay $5 or higher for each transaction if good alternatives exist. Not to mention high fees probably make quite a few UTXO unspendable altogether. I see the arguments for wanting to keep the blockchain manageable, but I worry about BTC's ability to be practical.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:35:52
 I was just referring to the opening and closing transactions. 10 dollars for a channel is still non negligible and it can go higher:
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:21:18
Man you cannot kill this exchange haha
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:26:02
It should be essentially baked into the price by now. It's a blockchain capacity increase so it should reduce fees in the short term.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:02:47
It might be a in a few months.

You owe if you took gains (sold back to dollars). I believe you also owe if you sell for another coin e.g. sell BTC for ETH. Not sure how BCash works for taxes, I'm hoping to find out.

Gemini is pretty solid imo. They allow you to buy before your ACH transfer fully clears provided you don't withdraw.

I appreciate his years of development that he put into BTC. Sad to see he got off the train when he did

I was thinking why wouldn't they. I mean it can't be that hard to integrate, and it's pretty low cost on their end, especially since users would likely bear the fees. I was thinking there may be a few things holding it back.
1. They probably pay low trans. fees on credit card transactions due to special agreements with CC companies.
2. They probably have some agreements with CC companies that they are the exclusive payment providers. 
Anyone else have thoughts on this?

If you're in the U.S., Coinbase is an easy way to start off.

That's Andreas Antonopoulos. He is a programmer who has spent the last several years evangelizing Bitcoin. His videos are well worth watching. He provides some of the best explanations of Bitcoin on both a technical level and on the "why should we care" level.
Edit: didn't get that OP was joking about the CEO of Bitcoin right away. It wouldn't surprise me from what I've heard people say!
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:54:40
Majority hashpower doesn't define a token, b/c it has to be hashpower creating blocks that conform to all the network rules. For instance, BTC and BTC cash are simply creating incompatible blocks, so no matter the hashpower on either, the other won't recognize it.
I think you're onto something tho, in that hashpower will ultimately follow the price, not the other way around (for the most part). If the majority of miners say they're going to start making blocks a new way, but the majority of users' capital stays with the legacy rules, then eventually the legacy rules will have more hashpower. Regardless, there is a case to be made that the legacy rules still define that token.

His description nails BTC pretty well, maybe not the untraceable part quite yet

I was thinking the voting system would just be a guide for the developers in making changes to the codebase. Of course you're free to run any version you choose, but to the extent that hard forks will be desireable at some point, wouldn't voting be a fair way to decide what features to add to new versions?

Sorry if I'm going too basic here, but a word of caution against shorting. Your losses can be theoretically unlimited. I don't know what the price of Bitcoin will do tomorrow, but if it keeps going up, you end up owing a lot.

ACH is slow, but it's also netting payments, so it's not as simple as a transfer from one account to another. Interesting article!

Well not all. Payment channels need to be opened on blockchain, unless I'm mistaken.

You could never completely eliminate it, especially since nodes in other countries would continue to function. But you could cut down on official uses (like not allowing any Bitcoin exchange to receive a money transmitter license), which would force a lot of U.S. based exchanges to close.
@_date: 2018-12-19 03:34:43
@_date: 2017-06-20 02:56:59
I think if you use standard ACH it's free, though it'll take a while to clear.

It's the Irish version of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-20 03:03:10
I've never had any serious problems with Coinbase, though others have. I think Gemini is worth checking out as well.

I think that if the government wanted to squash Bitcoin, they'd simply regulate it out of existence. No dollar printing needed.

This is so real though. Trying to explain Bitcoin just jumps in 15 different directions.
@_date: 2018-12-19 01:45:23
So it’s like BitPay?

I've never used one, but presumably Bitcoin ATMs would also fit this bill, but charge a premium.

Does Coinbase do dynamic fees?
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:49:52
My question is if the non-big block scaling solutions don't reduce some of the issues that have brought on the scaling debate (high transaction fees, long wait times), should we turn to big blocks? For example, lightning still involves on chain transactions to open/close channels. Suppose the netting offered by lightning doesn't end up taking enough transactions off chain, and we still see these issues (again, long waits, high fees). I hope this is more clear.
