Segwit provides cheaper on-chain transactions. LN provides instant and almost free off-chain transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:32:34
You would probably only be able to earn a very small amount.
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:45:21
Why would you need to close the channel?
And you should probably open channels with at least two people so they can use their money too.
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:51:14
You're more likely to find 10 000 blocks in 5 seconds mining on a flip phone rather than finding anything at directory.io
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:45:03
The Bitcoins will be lost unless the owner makes sure someone else can access them before they die. This doesn't matter though, since the total supply will decrease and thus the value of everyone else's Bitcoin will increase.
@_date: 2018-01-27 09:29:21
Also go to "Settings &gt; Options &gt; Network" and make sure "Map port using UPnP" and "Allowing incoming connections" are checked.
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:19:15
A channel opening or closing transaction would probably be closer to 300 bytes in size rather than 600.
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:07:48
You can use a backwards compatible segwit wallet which addresses start with 3.
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:13:38
To verify my own transactions so I don't have to trust anyone else.
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:29:49
It's not true.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:32:37
You can use the command "bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo" to check if your node has finished downloading the blockchain(this might take a long time on a pi).
To make Bitcoin Core on your computer connect to the node you can set "connect=&lt;ip&gt;" in bitcoin.conf. Remember that Bitcoin Core on your computer will still need to sync the data from your node. However this won't take as long as usual if you're on the same network.
You might also want to enable pruning on your computer so you don't have to save the whole chain on your computer too.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:38:42
11 000 listining nodes, there's more than 100 000 if you include non-listning.
@_date: 2018-01-27 11:52:10
If all the full nodes you have connected to work together with one of your lightning peers they might be able to steal the funds in your channel by keeping you from seeing the old closing transaction. However this is extremely unlikely and on average the person trying to steal the money would probably end up losing more than they manage to steal.
@_date: 2018-01-27 11:56:52
The average person doesn't have to understand how lightning works. Just like the average person doesn't have to understand how internet routing works.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:18:47
That is true, but the mining reward will also decrease over time. The point is, 1000x more transactions doesn't mean 1000x more energy usage.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:08:40
They'll probably change the default to bech32 once it's more widely supported though
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:58:49
It'll be easier to implement once 0.16 is out. The exchanges doesn't want to make two separate upgrades when it's only a few months away.
@_date: 2018-01-27 12:14:26
25% is amazing. What would you say if someone found a way to make the internet all over the world 25% faster without using any more processing power? Also, activation won't take as long as Segwit since it won't be miner activated.
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:51:44
It's basically a system which allows for instant, anonymous and almost zero fee transactions on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:12:24
If Bcash becomes centralized the nodes can lie about your current amount of bitcoins so you'll have to trust the nodes. If it becomes centralized enough they might even be able to increase the supply beyond 21 million.
If LN becomes centralized the hubs can do nothing. The hubs cannot censor or steal money. If a hub missbehaves everyone will just switch to one that doesn't.
@_date: 2018-01-27 11:40:11
No. You can run a lightning node without a full node.
Source: 
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:45:59
On-chain scaling only gives a small increase in transaction capacity. If we were to increase the blocksize to 2Mb for example, it would put twice as much load on the network for only twice as many transactions. The lightning network on the other hand could give us 10000 times more transactions without putting any more pressure on the existing Bitcoin network. LN will also give us instant and anonymous transactions and atomic swaps and more.
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:41:37
I don't think Ledger supports bc1 yet.
bc1 addresses will give you slightly lower fees. However they're not widely supported currently so I would just stick to the old format for now.
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:41:35
Other cryptocurrencies with segwit can use LN too. Litecoin for example. What is even more interesting is that you can do atomic swaps and pay someone that takes Bitcoin payments in Litecoin or something else.
It would probably take a while before it's implemented on other cryptocurrencies though.
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:19:55
There is no last block. And miners collect both newly created Bitcoins and fees, so there will always be an incentive to mine.
Lastly, the difficulty of mining a block changes depending on how much people mine so finding a block will always take 10 minutes on average.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:05:09
Even if there was zero transactions it would use the same amount of electricity. Even if there's 10000000x times more transactions it would still use the same amount of energy. It can scale just fine.
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:12:59
Future soft forks will probably be activated by a flag day rather than miner signaling.
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:44:48
Unless you care a lot about privacy, I would recommend following these instructions to get lower fees: 
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:49:39
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:37:20
You can also create fake gold. It doesn't mean it's worth anything.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:28:59
Replace-by-fee doesn't allow you to change the addresses. It only allows you to increase the fee.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:09:35
No, not for a long time at least.
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:42:03
Make sure you set a static IP for your node too.
Try enabling upnp on your node. You can do this by going into your node's bitcoin.conf (not the one on your computer) and adding the line "upnp=1".
You can use the tool at the bottom of  to make sure other people can reach your node too.
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:24:37
Probably because of fees. I think tip bots will come back with LN.
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:16:53
That doesn't help, the fake chain would still be longer.
You would need a full node.
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:57:02
You're usually connected to at least 8 nodes so as long as one of them do their job it should be fine. If none of your peers forward any transactions or blocks for some time I except that your node will disconnect them and connect to some new nodes.
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:37:12
Let's say the miners try to cheat the system by creating 100000000 Bitcoins for themselves. My verifying node will go, "That's not right." and will simply discard the block. This is why we need to download and verify all transactions.
Lite wallets will simply go "Well, it's in a block so it must be ok".
By running my full node I will make sure the Bitcoins I receive are real Bitcoins and not fake Bitcoins created by the miners.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:56:47
I would rather download 170 gigs over 1 kb/s internet than 340 gigs. Don't worry, there are other solutions which allow for cheaper and faster transactions without forcing users to download more data.
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:20:44
bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo
bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo
bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo | grep subver
bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo
@_date: 2018-01-27 11:58:47
They are also working on on-chain scaling like Schnorr/MAST and previously Segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:36:13
You don't have to move them, and they won't get stuck.
However, sending from the old addresses cost more fees, so it could be a good idea to move them to a Segwit address while fees are low so you can save on fees in the future.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:00:34
You don't have to, but it could be a good idea to open at least two. If the other person close the channel you'll also have to make another on-chain transaction to open a new one, so I think you would save on fees by opening two channels.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:05:59
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:24:19
This version won't default to bech32
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:04:51
Seems like you're right. Sorry!
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:26:36
Locking away money is a very misleading term. Money that you can instantly send from one place to another is actually less locked up than your on-chain money.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:33:07
You would only get that if it was used on the same computer. I wouldn't worry.
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:06:23
And how would a miner help?
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:49:13
They might close your channel to be able to use their money. If you have multiple channels open peers might want to keep channels with you open longer.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:54:10
They're aiming for 2018-05-01
When it's released it's possible we'll see an increase in segwit usage.
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:41:03
Bech32 is better, but since so few wallets/exchanges/etc support it I would just keep using the old format for now.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:28:20
Why can't beginners use Core?
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:28:21
No, you can run LN without a full node.
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:51:39
It's possible. Checkout CoinJoin. It improves anonymity and saves on fees.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:41:56
The difference is that in Bitcoin, everyone must use the same "cable". Imagine if everyone had to have transatlantic cables going to each house? Expensive!
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:31:34
I kinda agree. But I also find it kinda useful.
Maybe they shouldn't have it since there is no official price.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:35:32
As long as there is *any* Bitcoin left it'll be fine. Even if it's just one satoshi, precision can be increased so everyone on the planet can own a part of this one satoshi.

You would have to create a new wallet to get a HD wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:25:43
Can't wait for those lightning ATMs!
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:18:01
If you use segwit addresses you will pay less fees while sending from those addresses. Segwit addresses usually start with 3.
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:47:53
You can just close and reopen the channel with more funds. It would probably be better to just open a new channel though.
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:51:37
You can also run your node over Tor to hide your IP
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:22:40
You can also connect your Trezor to your phone!
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:19:37
Segwit just needs to be activated on the network(which it is). It doesn't matter how much people use it.
@_date: 2018-09-20 19:40:08
Testnet is for... testing.
It would probably be better to test this on your own personal regtest rather than crashing lots of testnet nodes.
@_date: 2018-09-20 12:49:56


The company...?


No, you do not.


Why wouldn't downgrading be supported? I don't see any reason it wouldn't.
@_date: 2018-09-22 19:35:47
I would be very surprised if Satoshi didn't use Tor.
So probably not.
@_date: 2018-09-20 19:32:14
In theory, a miner could prevent others from mining by crashing their nodes. But this would be difficult since mining nodes shouldn't accept inbound connections. So you would have to crash all listening nodes to prevent blocks propagating, something which isn't possible anymore since a lot of nodes have been updated.
@_date: 2018-09-30 12:13:45
I would prefer just saying "120 sats"
@_date: 2018-09-25 21:52:22
Is it a HD-wallet(older wallet)? Does it say HD in the bottom right corner?
If you're using a HD-wallet you shouldn't have to create any periodic backups.
@_date: 2018-09-28 19:09:39
I think the satoshi value would be a lot easier to read with digit grouping.
5 823 921 is a lot easier to read than 5823921.
@_date: 2018-09-22 10:14:56
They're not landing on the moon, and I doubt a hardware wallet would survive in space due to cold welding, radiation and whatnot.
With some planning though, a seed engraved inside of a steel block or something could either be placed in orbit or made to slam into the surface of the moon. But this isn't as easy as rolling down the window and throwing it out, so I doubt this will even be considered.
@_date: 2018-09-25 22:17:34
You should probably get a Trezor or Ledger if you're storing a larger amount.
If you still want to use Bitcoin Core, you could either create a new wallet and transfer the funds, or just keep making backups every now and then.
@_date: 2018-09-20 21:31:27
If a node allow inbound connections, the attacker can simply connect to it and send the invalid block causing it to crash.
If a node doesn't allow inbound connections, it's unlikely it would randomly connect to the attackers node.
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:43:18
You might have written it down incorrectly before, or entered it incorrectly.
Or maybe it's not a BIP39 seed at all. \(Sounds like it is tho\)
Did you make sure all your words are in the BIP39 word list? If one word isn't there then it's not a BIP39 seed.
@_date: 2018-08-02 17:40:04
You can't customize all characters, but you can customize any characters.
Vanity address generators work by generating lots and lots of addresses and for each one check if it has the characters you wanted. These characters can be located anywhere in the address.
@_date: 2018-05-22 09:28:23
No. This would result in permanent forking of the network. New nodes bootstrapping wouldn't know which chain was the orphaned one, and which one was the main one. Old nodes would probably run on the "main" chain, while newer would run on the "orphaned" chain.
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:38:56
That's only if you're using bech32. \(Addresses starting with bc1...\)
Get a segwit wallet using P2SH segwit addresses. \(Starting with 3...\)
Even very old wallets should recognize P2SH addresses. There's no reason to use non segwit wallets. Make sure to use bech32 whenever possible though.
@_date: 2018-05-06 20:49:42
In addition to other advantages that people have mentioned, if the block size is kept small, it'll force innovation to compress transactions and invent new technologies like LN.
@_date: 2018-05-07 00:36:52
I think it would be very very hard to gain consensus for a block size reduction. That's why we have to be careful with increasing it.
Also, we shouldn't decrease it too far so Bitcoin becomes crippled, but just enough so people still have to innovate ways of producing more compact transactions.
I think what we have now is perfectly fine. We can't keep forking the block size up and down because of temporary spikes in block space demand. In the future, a block size increase might still be needed if the demand for block space stays high.
@_date: 2018-05-07 00:25:50
Because it's very hard without making the system trivial to attack.
@_date: 2018-08-19 00:58:05
If you can't configure port forwarding on the router you can't listen for incoming connections on clear-net.
But you could configure your node to allow inbound connections over Tor.

No, any characters can be customized. But it requires exponentially more work to customize more characters. Check as many characters as possible.

I'm not sure. Does the Trezor wallet really support RBF yet?

It sounds like it might be an old Electrum seed. Try recovering it with Electrum. If you do find anything, you should transfer it to a new seed.

@_date: 2018-05-01 22:29:24
I'm pretty sure channels can stay open forever now. I think early drafts of the lightning network without segwit had channels which had to be closed after a certain time. Maybe that's what you're thinking about?
@_date: 2018-05-29 18:27:54
Using it would be fine. You would have to wait longer for confirmations though.

So what's the channel timeout then? And why does it exist?
@_date: 2018-05-19 13:00:14
I don't really know much about this, but I think the easiest way would just be if your parent made an account and bought you the Bitcoin with their own credit card. And then you just give them cash.

Most people are four quarters away from owning one bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-01 00:08:59
Any mainnet wallets I've used seemed to have it set to 144 blocks. And yes you can always force close a channel, but after doing so you'll have to wait 144 blocks before your money becomes spendable again. If this is a force close of an old state the person being cheated can publish a justice transaction during this waiting time.
But you can in theory keep a channel open forever as long as no one closes it. I have channels which have been open for months without ever making any transactions.
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:29:59
Wish more merchants used BTCPay
@_date: 2018-05-01 23:11:05
That would basically be a pre\-pruned full node. It's definitely doable and I think someone will make it if they haven't already, but it isn't as good as a normal full node since you'll have to trust that the checkpoint is genuine. To check this you would have to download the whole blockchain and verify it for yourself, you can't just do it by studying the code.
However you're right that the sync time and disk usage would be dramatically lower.
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:20:15
A lot of wallets allow you to use BIP39 seeds.
According to ledger's website you can use Mycelium, Coinomi or Bither. I'm sure there's more tho.
Get a wallet that supports BIP39 and do "restore wallet" or something simliar.
@_date: 2018-05-03 19:32:55
Did you make a direct channel or are you trying to route through some other node?
Also, are you sure you have channels which you can receive through?

Just wait and your transaction will be mined when there are less transactions.

From my understanding, quantum computers are mainly a threat to the private-public key encryption, not so much against SHA256. So old blocks should be safe.
If it was a threat, the old history could just be hard coded.

Actually, do you think it's possible you used Electrum to generate that seed? Then try recovering it with Electrum.
@_date: 2018-05-21 13:44:17
I don't think knowing just the month would be enough. If you know the last 3 characters every 58\^3 or about every 200 000th address would match. So there would probably be at least one false match every day. You would probably need a more specific time frame.
@_date: 2018-05-01 23:14:54
This would also help with bandwith usuage and block verification time during bootstrapping since you would skip verification up to the checkpoint. But you would have to trust the checkpoint.

I wonder, why would you want to settle your channel and get slow expensive transactions again? Why not just keep it open and have instant cheap transactions?
If the fees are too high to close the channel then they're also too high to do the payment on-chain.

Remember that even a strong password wouldn't really protect you against viruses, as they would just wait for you to enter the password. A hardware wallet would though.
@_date: 2018-06-25 23:55:18
There will definitely be a hard fork at some point. What would happen if a major flaw was discovered in SHA-256, would you still oppose a hard fork?
A hard fork can be safe with proper planning and overwhelming support.

1. In theory, but I don't think current implementations handle it very well yet.
2. The node id is also known as the public key of the node, which is calculated from the node's private key.

No, 1 satoshi per byte is the lowest fee you can use, even if you write a lower value into the custom fee box.

To prevent this from happening again, [get a hardware wallet](
The repairer could have stolen it, but it could as well have been a virus. It would be hard to prove.

I think an [Eclair node]( would be the easiest to setup. And it even has a nice GUI.
If you need help getting it to work you can message me.

Their nodes would look the same as any other nodes, so you wouldn't know you're opening a channel with them.
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:25:18
Are you sure you didn't import any addresses or used something like the getnewaddress command? If you did, and the backup was made before, those addresses wouldn't be included. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 21:48:45
Not sure. But I don't think the public key is hashed since you need to be able to use it for encrypting data.
It's some kind of asymmetric encryption at least.
Edit: I don't think there's such a thing as an "address" of a node. It's node id or public key, which are the same thing so there's nothing to convert.
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:03:17
It's too late to stop the transaction now. Your only option now is to convince the thief to send it back.

[Bitrefill]( sells Steam vouchers. They even accept Bitcoin through lightning.
@_date: 2018-06-08 06:24:21
You can't pretend to be some other node without knowing the node's private key. You can launch a lot of monitoring nodes yourself though.
@_date: 2018-06-08 14:18:39
This would in no way block all transactions. If someone spams lots of 20 satoshi per byte transactions, you would just have to pay 21 satoshi per byte to get your transaction confirmed.
@_date: 2018-06-27 21:24:48
Yes, they don't accept it anymore.
@_date: 2018-06-08 14:40:47
You can just increase your fee with RBF or CPFP if someone spams the network and you need your transaction confirmed quickly.
It's not possible to block all transactions. It's only possible to block transactions paying a lower fee than you. You would probably have to spam lots of 1000 sat/byte transactions to be able to block most transactions, but still not all of them.
This would be extremely expensive so the attacker would probably run out of money pretty quickly. And what would be gained from this attack anyways?

You're using another technology right now that used to be very slow and expensive in the beginning. Guess which one!
Things evolve, ever heard of the lightning network?
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:52:44
Transactions paying lower than 1 satoshi per byte won't propagate, so unless you mine them yourself you can't really pay less than that.
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:33:08
Did you generate addresses of all types?
Try generating a dozen bech32 addresses, a dozen P2SH addresses, and a dozen P2PKH addresses.
@_date: 2018-06-25 10:23:40
No, it's not redundant. You might not need as much decentralization but you still need some. If it's too centralized and one of the few hubs running has a problem it'll negatively affect the network.
But I don't expect LN to become very centralized, since everyone can run a node.

Wouldn't nodes have to verify the signature of each transaction it receives before adding them to the mempool and relaying them?
@_date: 2018-06-03 14:39:39
It would be nice if you could run your LN node as a hidden service and connect to it over Tor. Not only would it result in more privacy but also you wouldn't have to worry about opening ports or your IP changing.
@_date: 2018-06-25 10:14:58
A lot of people already have routers that are always on. In the future people might be using something like the litbox or maybe even have an internet router with a LN node built in.
People can then control this node with their phone, computer, or whatever they want.

Your transaction is in the mempool.
If it drops out of the mempool(probably wont) the funds will return to the sender, and you can try again.
@_date: 2018-03-03 19:49:13
I'm pretty sure it'll confirm soon. I would wait at least two days though.
If you're in a hurry you could do a Child Pays For Parent transaction for a higher fee. But I would just wait.

I wouldn't put my life savings on the liquid chain. But if exchanges want to use it to move money between each other then it's fine by me.
@_date: 2018-03-20 09:36:16
You have a router yes? Your router is always online, you could in theory run an LN node on that.
You node will then automatically create and manage channels for you. Then when you want to buy a cup of coffee your phone will connect to your node and tell it to send.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:28:45
And probably wont ever be. They can't ban SHA256.

Shouldn't they upgrade to validate segwit rules though?
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:53:42
They see the transactions in their mempool. Most mempools look almost the same.
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:23:14
No idea

They probably don't want people complaining that their addresses are "invalid".

The box would need to store your private keys to sign lightning transactions, but it's unlikely it would get hacked since you wouldn't be able to run unsecure software on it. And this is just your wallet for everyday spending, so don't store more in it than you would in your irl wallet.

Switching to IPv6 doesn't really give you any advantage yourself. Switching to bc1 will reward you with a little bit lower fees so there's an incentive.

A LN node doesn't need much. You can run it on any computer.
You'll have to run a full node though(for now). If you can run Bitcoin Core you can run a LN node.

How about having a 24/7 LN node at home, and your phone simply generating invoices for this node?
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:50:27
Segwit doesn't make your transactions confirm faster. You'll just pay lower fees.
@_date: 2018-03-17 21:43:54
PoS alone probably wouldn't be secure enough.
I'm hoping for a PoW and PoS combination though.

If you have your coins in cold storage, less security is another price you might have to pay.

No, you don't have to close your channels when you go offline. You can keep them open and just pick up where you left off when you go online again.

No, you need to be online to receive payments on LN. You can't make a LN paper wallet.

I feel like this would just be like a blocksize increase but with additional data needed on-chain. I don't think the reservation transactions would be very good.
I do like the idea of having some block space reserved for only LN punishment transactions though.

Bitcoin isn't a company project though.
What strong company is backing Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-27 04:44:35
Yes, the fees will probably be high sometime later again. But as long as you keep your channels open you won't have to pay any on-chain fees so it really won't affect you. It usually doesn't matter if you have to wait a while to open and close channels, so you can wait for the fees to go down again.
And the fees while using LN is indeed very low. It's rare to have to pay more than a few satoshis.
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:20:38
With "lncli feereport" you can see how much fees you've earned from payments routed through your node.
With "lncli listchannels" you can see if someone have sent you any satoshis yet.
Send me an invoice for like 100 satoshis and I'll try sending some to you!
@_date: 2018-03-20 09:05:35
You'll keep your LN node at home, and then have a mobile device which will connect to your node allowing you to send and receive funds. Why is this inconvenient?
@_date: 2018-03-21 11:44:53
Probably because most people want to do a test run first. It'll display strong warnings till you backup your seed.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:27:35
The first result is this page tho
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:48:26
Bitpay is an unnecessary intermediate. There's no reason to first send your Bitcoin to Bitpay, and then they send it to the store you're buying something from. This will only result in higher fees and counterparty risk. The whole point of Bitcoin is that you don't need intermediates.
It's better to use solutions like BTCPay where you send your Bitcoin directly to the store.
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:52:03
Even 100$ would probably be more than enough. But any amount you're comfortable with would be okay.
If you're in the EU, SEPA transfers to Kraken worked pretty well for me. But there are lots and lots of exchanges.

I'm pretty sure you'll have to enable RPC for your node.
Add these to your bitcoin.conf
    server=1
    rpcuser=whateveryouwant
    rpcpassword=yoursupersecurepassword
    zmqpubrawblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:18501
    zmqpubrawtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:18501
Edit: Nevermind I should have read more carefully. Couldn't you just create a new bitcoin.conf in that location though?
@_date: 2018-03-27 04:48:46

On-chain fees can still increase since people would still need to do channel opening/closing transactions. It's using the chain a lot more effectivly, but I doubt it's enough for all the people in the world. On-chain scaling is still needed.

He can still use LN. He would just have to transfer his Bitcoin to a new address format.
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:54:45
And the incentive to fix those exploits. It would at least be more secure than your phone, but less secure than a hardware wallet.
And even if you did get hacked, and lost all your money in your LN wallet, it wouldn't be the end of the world. It would probably be equivalent to dropping your irl wallet.
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:20:06

You don't have to be online 24/7. But it's a good idea to go online every once and then for now. In the future watch towers will be implemented so you can go offline for longer without worrying that the other party will cheat you.
Think of Trezor like your saving accounts, and an LN wallet like your wallet. In your LN wallet you'll only keep a small amount of money for everyday use. If too much money ends up in your LN wallet it could be wise to move it to your Trezor. If you run out of money in your LN wallet you should move some to your LN wallet.
And yes, you'll still need to pay for opening and closing transactions.
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:00:07
Hm... Doesn't seem to work. I get TemporaryChannelFailure and "unable to find a path to destination".

LN doesn't need you to download the full chain either. But it might be safer to do so.
@_date: 2018-03-03 09:01:07
You can do it with Electrum + Trezor
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:15:44
I also tried to connect to Sleepyark but they disconnected when I tried to open a channel. Maybe because they have too many channels already?
@_date: 2018-03-20 06:31:04
Yes, kinda.

That's not possible. LN needs the blockchain to work.
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:56:03
Unless someone can find peoples' private keys we can always hardfork and fix things.
If someone cracks the elliptic curve they can steal money from addresses which have previously sent money. Don't reuse your addresses!
But to be able to steal the money from an address which haven't spent before, someone would have to be able to crack the elliptic curve, the SHA256 and RIPEMD160 hashes at the same time. This is very very very unlikely.
@_date: 2018-03-03 19:32:41
It shouldn't matter if it's a segwit address or not.
It just seems like the fees have increased a little bit right now. Don't worry though, the fees will come down and your transaction will confirm. What fee did you put?
@_date: 2018-03-10 01:27:11
The number of confirmations is just the number of blocks found after the block your transaction got confirmed in. It will keep increasing forever as more blocks are found. This won't affect the transaction fee.
@_date: 2018-03-17 10:52:23
A LN node is just a computer running an LN implementation. Yes, you need to run a LN wallet to use LN.

I know that Samourai and Bread support it. Probably a lot of others too.
It really doesn't matter who broadcasts your transactions though. The important part is that it is your node that verifies that transactions have been included in blocks.

@_date: 2018-03-20 17:46:09
That's assuming everyone uses litbox though. There will probably be other products like it so the exploit wouldn't hurt all users.
Still, I think it would be much safer than software wallets, or apps on your phone.
@_date: 2018-03-14 04:50:40
It's the best we have for now. But it doesn't affect the main chain anyways so it's ok.
@_date: 2018-03-14 04:48:38
You could actually use both. You can use LN with liquid bitcoins to make it cheaper to open and close channels.
Liquid would probably be better for larger sums of money than LN though.
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:12:32
I think it does. The phone doesn't actually have to hold any private keys. Just let your node at home keep the private keys.
When you want to receive your phone will generate an invoice for your node at home so you can receive even when your phone is off or without internet.
When you want to send, your phone connects to your node at home telling it to send money to someone.
It'll function the same as if the wallet was on your phone, and you don't have to trust anyone to do it.
@_date: 2018-03-10 01:34:46
It is in your wallet already. 50 confirmations is waaaaay more than enough. I don't know why it would still say pending though, but I wouldn't worry.

In the context of LN, a node is a computer running a LN implementation routing payments through channels.
To use LN you'll have to create a channel to another LN node with an on-chain transaction. Once you have a channel you can send and recieve money from anyone on LN.

It would definitely be possible. You might have to send more data for lightning than on-chain transactions though. Less data would have to be sent if you were running your actual LN node on another phone at your home with wifi connection, and then just controlling it with SMS.

First of all, don't worry. It's very unlikely your Bitcoin would just "disappear". It might take a while, but it'll either return to your wallet or end up at Binance. Other block explorers can't seem to find the transaction either. Maybe it dropped out of the mempool? Remember what fee you used? If that's the case it should return to your wallet.

The safest way would probably be by getting a cryptosteel or something for storing your seed. That might be overkill though.
You would probably be fine with just storing your seed on two seperate papers, which you'll hide in two seperate locations where you're sure no one else will find them.

If it's a small amount it's probably not worth it

I don't think we're going to see a hard fork anytime soon. But when we do, I think we should make sure to include as many changes as possible.

I think it would be nice if the size of the circles depended on the number of connections a node has.
@_date: 2018-03-22 10:36:37
It's easy to generate an alternative history with PoS though. I think we would get the most security by using a combination of PoS and PoW. That way an attacker would need both 51% of hashpower and 51% of all Bitcoins, which is very unlikely.

Where did you place your config file?

SPV clients blindly follow what the miners say. Since it only validates its own transactions a miner can create a fork where they get a large amount of Bitcoin above the normal block reward. Then they can send that Bitcoin to you tricking you into thinking you got some money.
Later they stop mining their fork(which no one else mines on since it's invalid) and suddenly your money disappear from your wallet when the real chain catches up!
If you are using SPV you can be tricked by someone with a majority of the hashpower.

Using the internet was awfully complicated before. The average Joe doesn't need to know how the internet works under the hood to use it.
It's the same with Bitcoin. As the technology advances it'll get more user friendly.

Yes I do.
Most people already have a router running 24/7 at home. They might as well have a router with LN built in. Then connecting your phone to your LN node wouldn't be much different than connecting to your wifi. How is this impossible and inconvenient?

You need to decide on the content before you start mining.

That doesn't help. People can still send money anywhere on LN. Even though you only have a connection to Yalls, Yalls have connections to other nodes.
You should check where the invoice is sending the money before you accept it.

LN isn't a new address type. There really isn't such a thing as a "lightning address".
To send an on-chain transaction to someone using LN you'll first open a channel using an on-chain transaction, then you can make a LN payment to someone.

I always wondered, why doesn't your account say "Bitcoin Expert"?

I think switching to a PoW and PoS combination would be much better. That way you would need 51% of all Bitcoins plus 51% of all hashpower to attack the network or censor transactions.
@_date: 2018-07-03 22:21:21
You can only see the total capacity of the channel, but you have no idea of knowing who owns the funds. So you can't determine how much a certain node has.

The whole point of hardware wallets is that the computer can't find the seed. That would make them useless.

No, it's the opposite. By default the minimum relay fee is 1 sat/byte. You can however change the config to allow 0 sat/byte, but you probably shouldn't.

If you live in a stable country with a stable currency you don't *need* bitcoin. If you live in a third world country without access to banks, or without access to a stable currency, you *need* bitcoin.

When you plug your USB into your computer, malware on the computer will be able to steal your coins. On a hardware wallet the seed never leaves the device so it's safe to use even on an infected computer.
@_date: 2018-07-04 08:42:49
There is no way of determining who mined what block. The only way you can do that currently is because miners usually tell which blocks they've mined. If there was an incentive to not tell, they would simply stop. So this won't work. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 05:53:30
I would be extremely surprised if they didn't even support that format. I don't think this has anything to do with you using a segwit address. Something else must be wrong. Try contacting their support.

Can I use this on testnet too?
@_date: 2018-07-05 16:34:24
The easiest way to tell if your hidden service is working is probably just to wait and see if you get any Tor connections. It probably won't take too long, you'll get more connections the longer you've had your node up and running.
I think the "Request was throttled" error is just a problem with bitnodes. If you have inbound connections, it's working. Did you try entering some other node's IP to see if you get the same error?

We can't really measure hashrate distribution. Hashrate is just hashrate, we don't know where it comes from or who owns it.
All we can do is making an estimation by trusting that the miners are honest with what blocks they have mined, and which ones they have not.

Exactly the same thing would happen as if 7000 transactions were made at once. The unconfirmed transactions would be placed in the mempool until they're eventually confirmed in a block.
Nothing in particular would happen, and the system wouldn't be overwhelmed. If Bitcoin was so vulnerable you could break it by spamming transactions it would have happened already. Don't worry about it.
@_date: 2018-07-02 05:39:44
Most exchanges still don't support the bech32 format(starting with bc1), but you can use the backwards compatible format starting with a 3.

You would only risk loss of funds if you sent from the address before, and if the private public key encryption was broken, which is unlikely. But still, never reuse an address.

The mining pool can prove that they mined a certain block by signing a message. But you can't prove that they mined a block without their cooperation. And why would they help you prove something that results in them earning less money?
Even if you could prove which pool mined what block, this would just result in pools being split up into many smaller pools but still have one owner.

The other side will probably argue that mining is a "waste" of energy. Be prepared to counter this argument. For example with:
* Is securing a global world currency really a "waste"?
* The energy usage won't increase forever.
* The current systems use a lot of energy too. It's just harder to see.
* The energy usage of cryptocurrencies are more scaleable since it'll use about the same amount of energy no matter how many transactions are made.

You would usually keep the channel open till you have enough to close it without creating dust.
Let's say you do 10 000 transactions paying one satoshi. Now you can close it and get 10 000 satoshi on chain. It doesn't make sense to close it after sending just one satoshi.
@_date: 2018-04-30 15:39:12
It already makes sense if you're paying someone 1 satoshi every millisecond!
@_date: 2018-04-30 23:05:52
I'm pretty sure you can keep the channel open forever without doing any transactions. I think the timelock is relative to when the transaction got included in a block.

I assume you mean the total fees you've paid for a transaction? If you search for the transaction on blockchain.info it'll say the fee you've paid. Or can't you manage to find your transaction?
