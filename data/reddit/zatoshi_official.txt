Hey, If you are looking for a POS terminal, I have something for you.   
Our company is providing this solution for any type of business including barber shops. You can take a look at our instagram or website.   
We are providing tablets or we can give you a simple instruction to install it to your own device. I don't want to make this message looks like an ad, so if you have more questions feel free to discuss it right here

Hey! 
Let me explain it in details. Installation is completely free, processing of cryptocurrency cost around 1%. So, there is no catch, all what we are looking for is to prepare mass adoption of crypto and provide low cost solutions. 


No thanks! We don't need another intermediary that is monitoring/selling our data. 
Seems, that there is misunderstanding but thanks for your reaction.
It is not an app, it can be a ready-to-go solution or API for your apps, shops or other projects, our commission is only for processing. 
Our solution is for legal purposes. Any project can be monetized and merchant can start accept cryptocurrency, that's the point.

The main purpose of a cryptocurrency mixer is to hide (make it harder to track) your transactions and identity. At this moment, Bitcoin transactions are not really anonymous as they supposed to be. Thus, there are several mixers on the Internet and they have different algorithms and techniques. 
Mixer by Zatoshi was developed with the CoinJoin method, that means  multiple Bitcoin payments from multiple spenders will be mixed into a single transaction to make it more difficult to determine transactions and spenders.

You're not paying for installation or training, only for processing. It is based on BTCpay open-source project, we've made a friendly user interface, optimization and other features to help projects\\merchants run their business with crypto. It gives you control over all your invoices to keep legal accounting. 


Depends what are you doing.


It is KYC and AML procedure.

Thanks!   
Sure it will be there.

Holy! thats crazy.  What if other company is processing your crypto payments and providing you fiat at the end (no speculations only fixed terms), will you pay your regular tax or not?

At this moment Bitcoin and Litecoin accepted there, you just need to have a crypto wallet on your smartphone. They have a terminal (tablet), so when you will make an order just say that you would like to pay by cryptocurrency (specify crypto), they will take a tablet which will generate a QR code based on the amount of your final receipt. 


It should not take longer than 30-60 seconds.   


It is unforgettable when you are buying drinks or food for bitcoin, awesome :)
