Can you elaborate?

While it's nice to see that my comment ignited such a passionate response, my main point was that Bitcoin is not limited in its value as a currency, much like gold is not. Sure, we could go back and forth about the future of Bitcoin, but does it really matter? It is all just a gamble.

I'm no economist, but I find it weird that gold is not used as a medium of exchange which means you can't actually use this gold to, you know, buy things. As if any consumer is going to pay for their pizza using gold if it might have doubled in value in a month. And if gold is useless as a money, what good is it?
Secondly, people keep using the phrase 'investing in gold'. While I understand this is a common phrase, isn't this a misnomer to the extent you're just *betting* on it? It's not like you're buying stock in order to get return on equity.
Edit: Kind of /s. I'm not saying gold has no utility; I'm saying Bitcoin's value isn't limited to its use as a medium of exchange.

Nice straw-man, and thanks for supporting my point! My argument, which I hoped to get across through the use of an analogy, was that just because Bitcoin isn't the best crypto to use as a medium of exchange doesn't mean it is "useless", like the comment I replied to suggested. It is less of an argument against gold and more of an argument suggesting that Bitcoin's value doesn't solely lie in its use as a medium of exchange.

Yeah, sorry about that. I guess people misinterpreted my comment and took it in a way that I'm claiming that gold has no utility, which wasn't really my point.
