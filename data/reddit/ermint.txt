Yes, and people in China are perfectly well-aware of this.

What I mean by money not being stable is that the supply of money can vary, of course, just as the supply of goods does. Prices aren't like weights; you can't negotiate the proper weight of an object, but you certainly can a price.
With some inspiration from Menger, we might base a unit of value that no single party controls on something like a particular amount a good has the best combination of saleability, fungibility and also has a wide variety of suppliers, but that 
But with varying supplies and demands of all goods and services, there still can't be the kind of fixity that a physical measure has. I have trouble seeing how 1.0 International Value Unit would be a universal meaningful. It'll still mean different things to different people. 
On the other hand: Silver measures were used for hundreds of years as units of account, which weren't controlled by any one state, though. Is that the sort of measure you're thinking of?

Measurements of prices and value are fundamentally different, given that they measure *exchange ratios* - not inherent propers. And there is no lasting, subject-independent way to determine the the appropriate exchange ratio between apple and oranges or any other exchange ratio. It is subjective.
Shared units of account do exist, but they aren't stable over time (see: inflation, deflation, foreign exchange rates). They don't shift immediately, but they do change.
Which is fine. Value is, as opposed to weight, subjective. We don't need an agreed-upon standard of values. It's up for negotiation.
