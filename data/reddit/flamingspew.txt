These people are collecting interest. I don’t see the problem here.

Nations with weak institutions and bad economists. Have you even bothered to look at historic inflation vs interest rates in the US? In 74 indlation hit 11.5% so they ratcheted up the interest rates and it fell again. This has worked for 40 years. Bitcoin is all pump n dump like penny stocks.

No, i’m saying it doesn’t really matter that much. It’s what you donwith it... so rachet up the QE and sell those bonds, that’s the problem. The total quantity doesn’t really matter.

Uhhh. The total debt still doesn’t affect inflation. It’s what you do with that debt. An expansive monetary policy leads to inflation, but the fed can just as easily contract it. These hyperinflation examples given are nothing new. They overextended expansionary policy. Nothing to do with total debt.

our interest on debt is only 1.8% and interest was only about 5% of the budget. 70% of that is domestically owned by businesses and individuals. I'm not sweating, I'm diversified, but sure as shit ain't gonna put all my investments in bitcoin.

my coworker told me to buy etherium when it was at $.50. He is retired in Chile while I am using my little free weekend time to write this message.

The military had laser disks during WWII, I’m fairly certain there’s a 1000 qbit machine out there cracking all the data in the Giant Nevada facility.
