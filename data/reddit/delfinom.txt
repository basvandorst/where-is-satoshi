Yea chargebacks aren't anonymous.

Those are paypal chargebacks, not credit chargebacks where the bank will side with the seller if they provide tracking numbers and shipping company docs saying it was delivered at the address.

Its also a great way to become poor if you lose your wallet.

CC fees scale with the total pricetag.....not what Bitcoin does, its less painful if they aren't paying $5 for a $5 transaction.

Exactly the same as the stock market then. ICOs vs IPs, getting in at X, etc.
Stupid as I honestly think people treating cryptocurrencies like stock really hurts the future.

There are no taxes for just buying cryptocurrency and doing literally nothing with it and letting it sit.

This is behavior is completely normal for anything financial, you see it all the time in regards to stocks. You'll see tons of articles proclaiming X is great, or X is going to fail, etc. You see people who have obvious interests in either trying to hide it through talk of funny numbers and stats.

If that's what you hope for to get an re-entry point sure. If it's just to feel more happy, don't. Be happy with your gains which should already be plentiful. Don't jump on just pure emotion or you'll just be one of those guys who typically jump off buildings on wall-street.

Yes it's based on the % gain of an asset. In this case bitcoins would be multiples of an asset. Capital gains would be based on the % gain on the bitcoin fraction you sold and not the monetary equivalence. 
i.e. you sold 1.6 bitcoins, you would pay tax on the % gain of the 1.6 bitcoins.

Wow they have the scam called binding arbitration in China too.

Never try to time the market, that is the one rule any serious investor will tell you. Sell and buy when comfortable based on your own ability to handle risk both financially and emotionally. So what if it goes up? It could just as easily go down. It's all educated gambling at best.

Welcome to 90% of software patents.

The only cryptography in bitcoin that isn't for the peer 2 peer system is the public/private key wallets. These are implemented by many servers and other software for years.
@_date: 2014-01-16 23:58:16
Good news,  , plenty of prior art.
@_date: 2014-01-17 00:08:56


Bitcoin's implementation is extremely specific to PEER TO PEER computation. It has 0 value and usage in a centralized server. 
Bitcoin is only secure because every transaction must be verified by the the miner swarms verifying blocks. The miner algorithms confirm that a transaction is legitimate.
However, if anyone steals you private/public key pair for bitcoin(2 small simple files). Congratulations, you just lost all your money because that is all that is needed to perform transactions.

I don't understand your sarcasm, you use Bitcoin as an example of "cryptography features" as if it did something revolutionary when in fact it's common crypto used for years.

Yea...the CC number problem is only a issue in the US where people have refused to switch to chip and pin. In fact chip and pin is universal in Europe and spreading over Asia. So MAYBE after all the rampant credit card hacking revealed in the last month, MAYBE banks will start switching to chip and pin here. Pipe dream of course, because businesses simply don't give a fuck about security until after the fact...for a few months...

Having a window manager that doesn't allow you to snap windows into positions without a third party program is totally superior user experience ;)
Safety? Haha, they left the default password on a whole generation of laptop batteries. A program interfacing with the smbus driver on the laptop could easily disable the FET control safeties on that battery :P 
There's also the iphones which aren't able to come apart when their internal batteries fail and expand, so the result is lots of glass shards everywhere as the LCD glass is the first to give. Unlike other phones(with non removable batteries) where the phone comes apart without destroying the screen.
Otherwise, they don't really do much in terms of safety. Software is software.
No company/person is perfect, don't say they are superior.

Bitcoin is imaginary too. One well aimed solar flare from the sun and its worthless, along with all the computers in the world but eh.

Not shown are failures like smartwatches, 3d tvs, etc

It's not a satire post. Its an attempt at misdirection. It's fucking hilarious but this is a standard nutjob play. Christ, a bit more and he is competing against the sovereign citizen crazies.
@_date: 2016-05-09 19:13:41


I assume...they would want to integrate bitcoin into the existing system instead of creating something from scratch which would be idiotic. (i.e. payment method is just a small part of the overall system)

Have you read what delusional people write and do? Seriously, look up sovereign citizen defenses. You can get hours of entertainment.
Here's a quote from one case:
"Queen of England, entered into a Treaty with the Federal Government For the Taxing of Alcoholic beverages and cigarettes sold in America. The Treaty is called—The Stamp Act and in this Act, the Queen ordained that her Subject, the American people, are Exonerated of all other Federal Taxes. So the Federal Income Tax and the State Income Taxes Levied against all Americans is Contrary to an International Treaty and against the Sovereign Orders of the Queen.”

He should have tried the sovereign citizen defense.
