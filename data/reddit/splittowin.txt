Its the futures settling tonight... 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:42:06
Prob around 15.5-16 once the whales are finished dumping their free money in our faces. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:55:00
Im not 100% sure, but I believe you would get it for 12k, if I were sell em for 10k. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:59:57
Go to Gdax and make an account, you would prob just have to fill out one more ID-step, like Passport. Its hard to do on the computer, so download their app (Coinbase) and do it there.
Then proceede as Allergygal said
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:40:11
Its nearly 1800€ higher than the low we had today. At the time I wrote the comment, Bitcoin had "only" dropped 3.5% in €, and there were a possible gain of 2000€ if you bought at the low. 
Prob not a lot of people who bought some at that time, but was also meant in a possitive way, to cheer people up, because I feel like that there is a lot crashing-talk atm. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:32:45
No problem :) 
But def. use GDAX instead of Coinbase, after you transfered your funds :) 
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:34:44
Be carefull tho, If everyone is expecting a dip, then there wont be any dip Because its already calculated in the price.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:58:16
M8, listen now.. You linked to an article, where the distribution is. On your article, the 1# of bitcoin owner, is BITFINEX. Its their coldwallet. Thats where they keep a lot of their clients' Bitcoins. Thats why your claim is wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:49:55
Oh my bad. I dont think they have an app
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:05:27
That +400 rebounce in 30 SECS WTF
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:55:34
Yes, go download their app on the phone "Coinbase" and finish your verification. Had the same problem as you, and it worked.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:58:48
There were some really big sales, prob. a whale selling some. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:30:11
No, you need to put limit to 12.000. 
You can see that it says Total EURO: (320). 
So basicly your offer atm. is that you want to buy 0.16 bitcoin, when the price of one bitcoin is 2000. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:22:52
No. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:34:47
I did
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:11:28
Yes, thereby you would gain more bitcoins than you had earlier :) 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:26:37
Thats also true, but I suspect that the exchanges wallets outweights that people have several wallets, when looking at the distribution. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:32:06
Have you Tried downloadning their app "Coinbase" on your phone? 
It helped me through the verification process-problems I had on My Mac. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:17:03
Read his question again. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:57:26
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:54:50
A support is basicly a lot of people having buy orders at specific prices. 
Example, There could be a lot of buy orders at 12.400$ for at total of 600 Bitcoins, meaning the price probaly wouldnt fall beneath 12.400$ because of the "support"
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:22:03
Here it is
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:16:08
Hard to say really. 
It could be that a lot of people are anticipating a drop, and therefor sold (hence why the price has been lower these 2 couple of days), but the price goes up, and a lot of people want to get back in, and we see a huge increase. 
Could also be a big drop. 
Its a tough choice, if you wanna get back in the race, I would try to find a low buy for 50%, and wait for monday to see what happends. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:16:13
I was following at the trade history on Gdax, suddenly it came down to 15.600, and like a min later it was back up to 16.000
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:15:58
Are you using your computer or phone? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:24:01
Where are you from? If EU, prob try "BTC/EUR"
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:51:56
Yes they are Independent, they dont follow exactly, but EUR/GBP follows the USD most of the time Because of higher Volume. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:52:48
Gdax does that fine
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:36:38
Money aint lost before you sell again. If you bought at 18k, you probaly believe its gonna go higher. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:49:33
Addresses richer than
1 USD - 18,729,192
100 USD-7,210,632
1,000 USD-2,787,007
10,000 USD-863,327
100,000 USD-186,707
1,000,000 USD-23,771
10,000,000 USD-2,353
So because 3/4 of the people have less than 100$ worth of Bitcoin, and you see a distribution that had very few diffrent percentiles, you really think that "a very few accounts" hold 95% of the bitcoins?
Do you realise that some of these wallets are the companies where most people hold their bitcoins? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:27:41
Ye def hold atm, people selling
 now are prob losing money. If you sold a couple hrs earlier you should buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:49:03
Have you tried using the app on your phone?
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:04:24
Same. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:09:45
 
This is the bracket, I dont support  claim 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:46:58
What is this shitposting?
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:51:56
Congrats with your big %-gain to everyone who bought earlier today, when people freaked out. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:34:21
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:05:46
People have been trading like that all night, 6hrs ago we were 15.2k like now.
