I have no idea, I'm just giving him the benefit of the doubt until I have all the information. Maybe in the end he will turn out to being a thief, but as it stands the whole story doesn't make sense to me.

Why is everybody so damn sure that they have lost all the coins? I find hard to believe that they have lost the keys, and the hack doesn't make a lot of sense with the cold storage either.
@_date: 2014-03-01 15:01:40
Are decentralized exchanges even possible? How would you manage all the fiat?
@_date: 2014-07-01 19:13:27
Oh shit, what if I moved? 
@_date: 2014-02-15 07:02:17
Says the man who didn't believe Internet was the future...

I'm sure there are drugs to help with that.
@_date: 2014-03-01 14:48:47
I guess that is as good as it gets when you wanna trade for fiat...
@_date: 2014-03-01 11:38:31
Hehehe, I was a greedy fuck too :) I weighted the risk and made a choice.  Maybe the bad one we will see. No matter what it doesn't affect my economy too much, it just sucks.

For me, I like the tools available better. And the order book used to be deeper. In the last bubble the didn't perform worse that the other exchanges.
I also have an account in bitstamp. Nothing stops you from using more than one exchange.

I feel exactly the same and I think this goxcoin thing is a horrible idea.
@_date: 2014-03-01 08:39:46
Having the keys everywhere increases the risk of them being stolen.
@_date: 2014-03-01 15:58:43
I'm kind of suspicious about copypasted chat logs, did you witness that?

Thanks for the link, he was still wrong :)

Hehehe, for me people making final statements without knowing all the facts look more like trolls than I do.
I think its obvious that we are missing information.
@_date: 2014-03-01 14:09:59
Then it should be: "Why not use any exchange"
@_date: 2014-03-01 14:40:51
Nevermind, walking and reading at the same time. You're right.
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:21:59
@_date: 2014-03-01 14:42:46
That would be a good reason to stop using it.
@_date: 2014-03-01 13:00:30
Maybe.  Time will tell, I've never said I know the truth about any of this.
@_date: 2014-03-01 14:05:59
For those saying I am deluded or quoting fancy psychological conditions: if you take a minute to read my post I said **I had** those coins, for me they are long gone. The minute I got into bitcoins I accepted the risk and I'm totally fine about it.
@_date: 2014-03-01 11:45:59
that was funny but it's not the case.
@_date: 2014-03-01 15:46:53
I actually wanted to punch Mark in the face, but now I think I was being emotional. Let's see how I feel after all of this clears up.
@_date: 2014-03-01 11:41:23
I don't see how this applies **only** to Mtgox.
@_date: 2014-03-01 11:44:19
did you even read my post?
@_date: 2014-03-01 11:47:21
I think you're missing the big picture. **IF** all of this was because of a seizure/gag that could happen to any exchange.
@_date: 2013-05-12 07:24:23
At least on linux there's a hidden folder in your home called ". bitcoin".  To fix this problem you just need to delete everything inside it except "wallet. dat". 
@_date: 2013-03-31 09:17:28
I'm at 120, I'll let you know tomorrow if they don't accept. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 10:57:19
I'm at 8640 btw.
@_date: 2013-03-31 13:51:24
I have nothing to hide
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:10:15
thanks, I missed the other one. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 10:56:15
Well, they might have changed their policy because of the high workload... They just denied my application today, and I'm back to the end of the queue.  I'll let you know if there's any news.
