He doesn't intend to use it in some land mark trial, he intends to go after youtubers and store owners to get a slice of the proffit legally as long as he can before its taken away.

This is what im talking about, so much salt. Not really sure how that makes me a retard though.

Most of those systems are automated, Just an FYI. The only time it wont work is when people dispute it \(and even than, he has the patent, some companies will side with him until he doesn't\). If he flags thousands of videos for example hes going to make money off them. It's dirty af dont get me wrong.

Implying i can't do many thing's at once? Who's really retarded i wonder. In any case I'll spend my time how I like, And if that means watching people suffer makes me giddy than so be it. Think about this, Your anger towards me actually brings me pleasure, And when you read this your going to become even more angry towards me. I win, I'll always win.

No... He's not.. Do some real research, don't just listen to the headlines.

Implying somones online personality is completely different than their in-person one, Or that you could get any significant information about someones real personality from such a limited amount of reference.  sample size.

depends, until the next difficulty adjustment but it would only last for 200 BCH blocks.

Lol why so many new accounts trying to jump on the pro "dont worry its ok" bandwagon. Really makes one think.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:35:42
I actually haven't seen many. A lot of the fud going around is true.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:11:56
But what if BCH makes it to 3k and it still ends up being more profitable than BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:47:39
i think he means by usd, But he's up in BTC. That's how most trade, btc was always the end goal. *was* no idea whats happening now.
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:16:58
Heh, next level scam. props to whomever came up with it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:22:15
You guy;s should have realized this was a planned coup, its not a pump and dump. At least that's the way im seeing it right now. You guys think big money is in for btc but that might not be true. Behind the scenes big money is plotting. They want a faster chain.
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:12:28


Heh, so many deluded people. Why do you all think they are ACTUALLY doing it this way? it certainly isn't from the kindness and generosity of their hearts.

There is no single source to cite, nor would there be. You will need to dig deep into the conspiracy/truther realm to find more info as its far too much for me to just add to a Reddit comment. Lot's of clues in predictive programming, so i think that is a good place to start if you were actually serious about looking into it. conspiracyoutpost is a good forum, their search function should bring up a load of info. It's none biased so you should find opinions from people who agree and disagree, so its a good spot.
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:00:18
Report them for what? No reddit advertising rules were broken. False reporting just gets you dinged.

his obvious hyperbole aside, Theirs plenty of flags and signs the global market is about to crash hard (and its not going to be a natural crash). It's not something anyone can outright deny, especially people who follow all the subtleties, the same people that predict the other crashes (truther theorists). I think crypto will do well in this situation, especially with the trade war stuff.
