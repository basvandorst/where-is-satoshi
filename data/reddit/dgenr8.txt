I don't think L2 is necessary.  Satoshi pointed the way to scaling, and it's called SPV.
The bitcoin network can become a true distributed database of blocks and transactions, and SPV clients can improve their techniques to the point where security is better than the masses will ever need.
Miners, nonprofit foundations, businesses, governments at various levels, universities, and enthusiasts can still run full nodes, or nodes that can validate a proportionately larger subset of the database without needing to consult the network.

Hi Meni.  I understood your claim and thought about generating a bunch of poisson-distributed events, then taking poisson measurements against it.  I haven't done it yet because it seems rather tautological.
Maybe you could share a little more about your simulation?  Is it a simulation or a replay of bitcoin history (which would generate events for past hashrate anomalies)?
Is it the same approach as the code above?  Rather than simulate 4-hour intervals and check for the frequency of block count = 48, that code generates 48-block sequences and checks for the frequency of 4-or-less-hour intervals.
The alert check in core is triggered by a scheduler thread every 10 minutes.
@_date: 2015-12-29 15:06:58
Ah, yes of course.   You show it's important that the measurement intervals be disjoint, so that 48-block sequences crossing a 4-hour boundary do not trigger the alert.  The math assumes these will not be detected.
It would seem that the fix is to run the test at a frequency that matches the sample interval.  What do you think?
@_date: 2015-12-30 01:49:14
You can't get a good measurement on the low side with a 10-minute sample interval.  Even at 2 hours, a measurement of 0 blocks doesn't get you to the 50-year level:
CDF[PoissonDistribution[12], 0] &gt; (2 * 60 * 60) / (50 * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60)
You could use something less than 4 hours for the high-side check.  But I propose keeping it at 4 hours and using the original threshold levels, and just checking only every 4 hours.
I don't understand your point 2.  Your client just has to watch for the entire interval and then start a new interval with no overlap.

The important similarity is that GreenAddress and Lightning each require both sides -- sender and receiver -- to use something different, and more complex, than a regular bitcoin transaction.
They both have to restart with 0 network effect.
GreenAddress never got anywhere with users.  Scalability is irrelevant in such a scenario.

 - Semantics.  Who cares what *name* the world's reserve currency winds up having?
 - Since we're discussing semantics, XT is not an altcoin.  It is a client that will follow a hard fork (aka forkcoin) under certain conditions.
Any hard fork is a forkcoin -- including the future fork planned by Blockstream.
A forkcoin is distinguished from altcoins by its acceptance of the entire blockchain prior to the fork.
@_date: 2015-12-24 05:26:53
I'd be a lot more excited about Lighting Mightwork if there were one, 1, ONE merchant accepting GreenAddress.
From a user perspective ,the benefits of GreenAddress (instant confirmation) were similar, and the hurdles to adoption were actually lower.
But nobody wanted it.

 - I agree that the thresholds should derived from the CDF, not the PDF.
 - At the 50-year level, it doesn't matter (the thresholds are still 5 and 48).
 - Sampling more frequently than every 4 hours will cause the alert to be re-issued multiple times during an "event", but won't cause the overall event to trigger too frequently, as long as the threshold p-value is correctly calculated for the distribution -- using the 4-hour time window.

I eagerly await your response on the mailing list, to detailed rebuttal.
You can mention that in your view of the world, a Finney attack is not an attack at all.  In fact I'm surprised you haven't suggested renaming it the "Todd Non-Attack" by now &lt;-- you're welcome.

Why should that $100B or $1T go into bitcoin?  Why should the holders of that fiat pay $450/coin to bitcoin holders for the privilege, rather than using a pure-clone altcoin or a new altcoin where they can own any percentage they want?  They can easily buy massive hashpower as well.
Bitcoin's acceptance in trade is the ONLY thing that distinguishes it from new or existing altcoin alternatives.  Ignoring the use cases you list in your table is very unwise.

Something I really respect about Jeff is that he can maintain perspective.
We know from his previous writing that he doesn't believe "all the coffees" can be recorded on the blockchain.  But, unlike other thinkers, he doesn't let that opinion force him into a battle mentality where he refuses to move an inch, for fear users will take a mile.
He credits users with intelligence, and he views bitcoin in the context of the ecosystem it has created, so he prioritizes the important short-term bump above what he sees as a medium-term need to develop "layer 2".
Jeff and Gavin are the kind of practical leaders bitcoin needs.

As you well know, Patrick set a goal that even the current network cannot meet.
Someone should have asked him what % of current nodes would be able to validate the entire chain AND keep up with new traffic.

Miners, and dumb relay nodes, have to watch the validating p2p network.  Mining is still permissionless (as far as I know).
And, seeing a confirmation 30 seconds sooner is a huge improvement for everyone.

According to CEO Austin Hill, the proper role for users is to feel sympathy for developers who work hard on things they don't want.

There are two advantages of these schemes over the Fast Relay Network (FRN).
One is that the FRN is non-validating.  It will rebroadcast an invalid block to many other nodes.
Another is that the FRN receives blocks primarily from other miners.  Miners should remember that other miners actually have no short-term-greedy incentive to relay other miners' blocks at all.  They should always monitor the main network for new blocks.

At an exchange, all of the matched or crossed bids/offers are cleared immediately.  The book tracks unmatched bids/offers.
If there is a backlog of matched or crossed bids/offers, something is very wrong.  If an exchange has to cap the number of immediately executable orders, something is very wrong indeed.
A better analogy is an auction of some limited resource like EM spectrum or tickets.

Bless his heart, Satoshi failed to consider the possibility that his own project became the corrupted one.
@_date: 2016-10-31 15:33:11


Look beyond the oft-repeated platitudes.
Miners cannot force a hard fork on ALL fully-validating nodes.  But the nodes that come along with them are joining a more secure network.

The idea that not voting for some change is "malicious" makes a mockery of the voting process.
What a spectacle it will be, if miners devote their resources to undermining other miners' work and further slowing the network.

Today's fees are already greater than the subsidy will be in 2045, with almost a century of subsidy remaining.  So there's very little reason to worry about total reward ever going to zero.
@_date: 2016-05-10 04:05:55
The problem with this scheme is that is doesn't support unconfirmed transactions at all (how this could be omitted, I have no idea).
If you want a wallet that only shows confirmed payments, well ok.  But otherwise, you still need a different scheme to pull in unconfirmed transactions and their relevant parents and merkle branches.
To suggest this scheme could be a BIP 37 "replacement" is to suggest that NO unconfirmed transactions would be transmitted to the SPV wallet at all by bitcoin nodes.
Along the same lines, since it requires sending complete blocks, this scheme is optimized for small blocks.  This is exactly the world where SPV wallets (and bitcoin in general) will be least useful -- a high-fee, low-volume environment.
The oracle version requires a group of signing nodes.  Why not just use Mycelium / Electrum?
@_date: 2015-11-27 15:38:43


Did you mean "do not appear to be?". Presuming so.
Assuming that the value of subsidy/2 four years hence is 1/2 the value today assumes that the value of a single bitcoin has remained constant.
That is not a reasonable assumption given past empirical evidence, and particularly given that the change being analyzed aims to improve the currency.  
A change that corrects the cheapness of double-spends would greatly increase the utility of the currency, increasing the value of the subsidy (which is paid in bitcoin) along with the value of all other bitcoins.
Any analysis that hinges on declining subsidy examines the system on a time scale of decades.  In that long-term space, the changing importance of bitcoin vs. the global money supply cannot be ignored.
There is an awful lot of room for the currency to grow its share of the global money supply.  Right now, at $5B, it stands at about 1/10000 of global M2.
Getting to 2/10000 would double that value.

@_date: 2016-07-28 15:57:50
Sounds plausible.  In that case the miner is at risk from trusted tx authors and should seek recovery from them if they violate the trust.
And all hashers should be rightfully enraged if ever an invalid block is handed to them to solve.  This should be shouted from the rooftops.
@_date: 2016-07-28 14:39:44
That risk can be lowered below an arbitrary threshold by connecting to multiple peers.
The network provider is still a point of vulnerability.  Developers like breadwallet can mitigate that by supporting encrypted connections to trusted peers, maintaining multiple network connections, etc.

"people who will be rewarded are the token holders themselves"
Maybe, for a while, but in a world where everyone just makes/trades tokens all day, no actual work gets done.
There's actually too much focus on money. Galactic credits are supposed to disappear into the background, reduce risk, and save people time.
