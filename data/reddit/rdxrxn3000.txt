so bitcoin isn't dead?

who's they? I have a feeling you are right. The regulation announcement was timely. 
Also the way they set up CME at ATH was a great setup for a short

I see thanks for the responses. It does seem risky somehow. But there are millions of  dollars worth of bitcoin exchanged for USDT all the time in these many exchanges. I assume all of those millions of USDT on Binance, Kucoin etc.  are just waiting to get back into crypto in order to buy back, hold  or be sent to a real USD exchange to sell. 
USDT makes me wonder about the valuation of Bitcoin/crypto.
Hopefully tether does not crash, it will be bad for many of us.

first time buying bitcoin here. I kept telling myself that I missed the bus so I never bought before. Now I have no excuse. I was actually glad to have been given this opportunity. Thank you bitcoin futures?

Imagine how easy it would be to idk call some legislator in Korea and idk announce some sort of ban right before a shorting date.

I knew something fishy was going when some pundit on CNN was encouraging people to buy Bitcoin... That was bizzare. I knew then to hold off on buying.

yeah and the weak handed normies are gone. Hopefully they sold at a massive loss and don't come back.

How does that work? as in how do they get the price so low? 
Do they have contacts in countries to spread bad news? 
Paid fudders?
