Coins are moving.
I am pretty sure I know there is very little I can do. Can anyone help in any way?
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:37:14
If anyone can recover any of the funds I will happily give them $500 USD
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:18:03
Will do. Wont recover the funds though.

If by any chance the person who stole my coins has a conscience please return them to 1H1nEdhZbnigGurRoGAdPiaWVvzibq7ZTR - I was relying on those coins.

So I have lost 0.23217519btc.
I am done with crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:20:22
Is it possible to get that?
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:06:16
Seed is kept on a piece of paper as well as password.
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:10:28
I didn't do anything. My security is 100%. Didn't click any phishing links or give my seed to a third party. I do not know if there is a vulnerability in Electrum.
I have lost over $4,000 and I feel awful.
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:51:59
No idea.
