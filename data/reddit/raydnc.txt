Nope I do not. Never really gotten involved in the whole mining thing just invest regularly. How’s mining been working out for you if you don’t mind me asking? 
@_date: 2018-08-26 22:15:31
Ha ha yup, only 16. Been involved in crypto almost 2 years.

You’re like a week late my guy.

Too young for the poll

Something is quite off with your logic bud

Yeah it’s more than possible and actually somewhat likely at this point. Just so hard to predict at this specific time considering the insanely low amount of volatility recently. If we break 6,100 clean I’m at least expecting a short term bear market. I’d expect to see 7,400 broken through before ever even considering bull market though. Aghhh, this gets on my nerves not gonna lie. I want to make/lose money already...

I’d honestly enjoy a plunge to 4k- over this. Hateee sideways action with a passion. Always the hardest trend to make money in, at least for me.

Yes, they still do. They also happen to accept iTunes gift cards. It’ll most likely come at a premium cost however. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 01:39:43
Yes I believe so. Just check out  and see what payment methods they accept. There’s like 300+ currently.
@_date: 2018-10-08 22:26:55
I believe paxful used to accept gift cards in exchange for cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 22:31:35
Not for certain on that one. You can check it out for yourself,

Crypto might just not be for you... 
@_date: 2018-11-24 06:20:58
You good?
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:35:30
Definitely legit. I hope you’re joking, but regardless, don’t click it period and just delete the conversation. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:37:53
I’ve heard this before. But jw, why exactly is that?
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:16:07
I was able to read your post. Quality, thanks for the post!
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:08:07
What. In. The. Fuck.

Okay smart ass, the right time to buy was at .01 in 2011. Why didn’t you? You keep waiting my friend, I’ll keep accumulating. People who actually know what they’re doing will never be “bag holders” because we invest in worthwhile projects and don’t spend more then we’re afraid to lose. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:40:23
Bi-weekly as in once every two weeks. Essentially every pay day for me lol. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:26:40
There will never be “the right time”. Investing is about taking risk and learning from failure. Would I say now is a good time to invest, yes. Do I think the market will go even lower, yes I do. But, tomorrow is never promised. My strategy is investing on a bi-weekly schedule, regardless of the current market situation. If I were you I’d invest 25-50% of what you’re wanting to spend now and keep the other 50% liquid to invest in small amounts as we go down or up. Just my personal opinion, happy investing ;)

I like the layout! Scrolling from side to side is slightly different for me but it’s not too bad. I think I would really enjoy this if it was built into an app. Great work, keep it up!
