Having trouble with your words today, OP?
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:32:42
I skimmed through the comments and couldn't seem to find a response for the following question:
Why exactly are you doing this? What's in it for you?
@_date: 2014-03-11 03:41:12
a) None of your friends think that you're rich. Most of them probably don't even properly understand what bitcoins are. 
b) Your mother has no fucking clue what mining is. 
c) this is a horrible post in general, and makes the community appear to be filled with a bunch of monkeys. 
I honestly don't know why this got upvoted.
@_date: 2014-03-11 06:56:23
But hey, when something goes wrong at least the mods sticky a post with the suicide hotline at the top of the front page so that the lovely folks of this subreddit have somewhere to turn to after they gamble away all of the college allowance that their parents gave them because they didn't take the time to educate themselves as to what bitcoin is all about. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 18:27:22
Holy shit that title was a little misleading. It's like saying "I bought a holiday house with my bitcoin!" (Then subtly mentioning that it was one of those malibu barbi holiday doll houses). 
@_date: 2014-02-23 04:22:26
Lol, okay just so we're on the same page, I'm not trying to sit here and shit on you for doing a good deed, there is nothing wrong with your post so there's no need to jump on the defense. I was just noting, for the sake of discussion, that your title initially came across as a bitcoin success story which ended in you using your profits to buy yourself a boat (which are generally seen as reasonably expensive in places like America, Australia, etc). Going on to read your post though, the inside story is completely different to what people who clicked it were probably expecting.
I assumed that this was something you did intentionally, but garnering how defensive you are being on the matter, I guess I was wrong.
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:05:14
Man, if I was a ~~doge~~ dog I would love to piss all over that.
@_date: 2014-02-23 03:11:13
Because you intentionally left the title in a way that it could be misconstrued.

I guess all the good ideas were already taken.

Lol, that might be a tiny bit of an understatement. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:35:29
At the moment, because the price is so high I think there has never been more incentive to mine them. Now I haven't been checking, but I'm sure the guys who run the system have probably been jacking up the 'difficulty factor' to try and balance the amount of mining, it's almost like a gold rush of sorts.
The difference between a gold rush and bitcoins though is that with a gold rush, with the exception of land owners, people don't directly control the supply of gold. The company/organization who created bitcoins and sets the difficulty factor and stuff literally have a small economy forming beneath them, and they are not accountable to anyone. That's what scares me. 
In the stock market, companies are accountable to both the government through laws, and shareholders. While you could argue that with bitcoins, the people holding coins are the equivalent of "shareholders", there is no regulatory body to stop the people controlling the supply from either doing something immoral and taking advantage of the system, or selling their control to someone else who will. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:08:10
Well you seem pretty optimistic, so how high do you predict that the price will go before it either stabilizes or crashes? 
(Also, at what price did you buy, if you don't mind me asking?)
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:52:30
Interesting, so if you don't mind me asking, roughly how much do you believe you'll be able to mine between now and then?
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:59:47
But in order to be used successfully it will need to be stable or merchants and sellers won't have the confidence to use it. 
(Using simple figures in the following example): If 1 Bitcoin is worth 50 dollars, then the merchant who prices against a currency like US dollars will put something that is worth 50 dollars for sale for 1 bitcoin. But what is the value of coins drops over night to only 25 dollars? The merchant will have to quickly raise his price to 2 bitcoins otherwise people will take advantage of the price gap that is created and essentially buy stuff for half price.
Now even if there is a system in place where the merchants site has some sort of algorithm where the price of his stuff for sale automatically adjusts, the merchant still risks losing money if the price drops after a consumer makes a purchase. This is ultimately why I think it (at least for the time being) fails as a currency. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 10:31:48


This is a function that regular money already performs, (in case you were distinguishing the two concepts of storing wealth and currency for some reason).
But one important criteria for performing both of these functions is relative stability. For the moment at least, bitcoins are very far from stable. In fact, the price is moving so quickly that I wouldn't feel comfortable leaving any of my wealth invested in bitcoins because I'd be scared that one night I might go to sleep and wake up the next morning to find the price has crashed. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:51:00
Does it work that way? If I was to sell you something and you paid in bitcoins, does that site automatically and instantaneously buy any bitcoins that you pay me and give me US dollars or whatever I want?
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:55:50
Your way of thinking is poison. 
The reality is, something did happen: A demonstration of how volatile the currency is, **in both directions**. Fortunately for people currently holding, the price drop was not enough to deter outside buyers from exploiting the fall in price in order to buy into the market (which is why I believe the price has gone back up so quickly), but if the price can drop over $100 dollars on one given day, what's to stop it happening the following day? 
Your "investment" is more of a gamble than anything at this point, so don't fall into the trap of negating that drop as inconsequential, because it's anything but that. 
(Not to mention, another problem that I haven't seen too many people talking about is the time lag in updated price figures and transaction completion. You could make a decision with the information available now, only to find that 3 hours later that information caused you to make a loss because it was actually outdated.)
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:33:11
Exactly, there's no regulation so why the fuck would anybody want to participate when people can manipulate the market like that?
The mistake that people here (and I'd wager that due to the arrogance of the above comment you probably fall into this category) is that they are mistaking luck with expertise. 
This time next week, bitcoins could be over $300 a piece, or below $100.
The people who sold were the speculators. The high appreciation rate of the price has drawn in people who were trying to make a quick dollar and despite the crash, the price has quickly risen again due to the influx of people who saw the crash as a good time to buy in.
What very few people seem to comprehend though is that this currency was not intended to be a medium of investment, but rather a medium of exchange (as with any currency). The snowball-effect of it's price rise though has led to people buying bitcoins in order to try and make money off future price rises, rather than to actually use them for their intended purpose. As far as I'm concerned, it's a 21st century version of tulipmania.
@_date: 2013-04-03 10:19:10
The problem is though, things are valued against other currencies (such as the US dollar) so if you buy a bunch of coins and then they drop in value, then you've lost purchasing power. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:49:07
Yes! Exactly, I finally found someone who gets what I've been trying to say :P
If people aren't going to be willing/confident to accept them as a form of payment, then they fail as a currency. So that leaves the investment factor. With stocks, the value of a stock when it is first put on the market is valued based on the percentage of the company it represents. Even if the company goes bankrupt, the stock still retains some value in the form of the capital/assets that it represents the value of.
So where does the value of bitcoins come from? There is nobody really controlling them, they are just bits of code which are only worth what people are willing to pay for them, which could literally drop to zero if people were to hypothetically lose complete confidence in them down the track.

Well another issue is that economists ultimately deal with resource management problems, and the discussion we're having is more or less in the realm of financial analysis. 
So changing gears for just a moment, I guess the most simplistic notion of financial analysis is 'risk vs return'. Without even needing to understand the differences between bitcoins and other forms of "investment" (and I use that term loosely due to bitcoins not being created as an investment opportunity but rather an alternative to other available currency mediums), you should notice a red flag being raised by the fact that the price of coins has began to suddenly rise so steeply this year. 
If you can invest your money at any level above the average interest rate being offered by banks in your respective country, you're already doing better than the average person. At the moment in Australia, (where I'm from) banks are offering something pretty low at the moment, I think it's only 3.25% p.a or something... though it was as high as almost 7% last year. 
Now with bitcoins, they've risen in price from about US$30 at the end of February to over US$100 on the 1st of April. That's an increase of over 230% in two months, as opposed to the 3-7% offered by banks for term deposits. So consequently, the risk associated with coins based on their current level of return would be astronomical. 
In fact, because the price is so volatile at the moment, I wouldn't personally even feel comfortable attempting to use coins as normal currency because I'd have the sinking feeling that I could go to bed one night, and wake up the next morning to find that I had lost a lot of money, just for holding onto my bitcoins which I planned to buy stuff with. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:45:42
Its a high risk investment to make... If I felt there was any chance that they'd go that high one day I'd happily buy a few and set them aside, but everything I've learned about finance and currency through my degree gives me a gut feeling that this is a bubble that could pop tomorrow, or could pop in 6 months... But there is no way to know when it'll happen.
It's kinda like playing hot potato with a hand grenade where the longer you hold it, the more money you make, but if you hold it too long and it explodes, then you lose everything.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:44:20
I'm about to head off to bed, so I don't have time to check that, but it doesn't seem right... By definition, banks pay interest to you because by saving you are lending money and consequently due to the time-value of money, the interest rate the bank pays should always float about the real interest rate.
I'm not American though... In Australia, our bank rates are always above the real interest rate.  
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:05:11
Well I just checked and the price is around $120... so considering it's lower than yesterday, I don't think your market manipulation strategy is panning out :P
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:33:10
Yes, but that reward is created by you taking the risk that you'll lose the initial investment. This is why spending your life savings on lottery tickets isn't a good idea... Extremely high risk and extremely high reward, but simply not a rational thing to do.

And I think that gay guys shouldn't befriend so many girls, because they distract them from the fellows who are trying to get laid. 
My point is, what I "think" doesn't really matter. And neither does what you nor anyone else, unless they can prove it. I chose not to partake in bitcoins for a number of reasons (volatility, lack of regulation, questionable transfer rates,) 
I am admittedly jealous of the people who have made money off of bitcoins, but they aren't financial geniuses (well none have come forward to explain themselves at least). As far as we're concerned, they invested in what they saw as an internet currency, but it instead launched as more and more people bought into it, so now it's not so much as a currency as it is a high risk "stock", except there is no company that it belongs to, and it's inflated value is purely respective of how many people choose to buy into it (limited bitcoins as you know, supply/demand etc etc etc). 
@_date: 2013-04-03 10:27:33
The laws of supply and demand begin in the realm of microeconomics. At the moments bitcoin is an unregulated currency that is seen as more of an investment opportunity than a medium of transfer which already sets off alarm bells for a lot of people. 
The reason economists don't have much good to say about bitcoins is that bubbles are not a new occurrence and have been happening for almost as long as people have been practicing commerce.

@_date: 2013-04-10 23:28:50


And this is why it fails as a currency at the moment. Currencies should be stable. If somebody holds onto a currency, they shouldn't have to worry about the value doubling or halving by the time they wake up in the morning. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 11:03:45
Well there are several articles out there (one on the front page of this subreddit today) about how more and more merchants are offering to accept them as a form of payment. So this is a good thing. But unless you're some sort of gambler/drug dealer/tin foil hat wearer, there is no major incentive for the average consumer to forfeit the security provided by conventional currencies (banks, paypal etc) and start using coins. It's a very niche market at the moment, and the majority of the people who seem to be using them at the moment as we've discussed are people who hope to make money off them rather than actually use them to buy things.
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:23:52

@_date: 2013-04-03 11:27:42
Actually depositing money in the bank is the safest alternative, assuming you live in a stable and developed country because by default the national cash rate is usually above the inflation rate. 
As for "nothing better to do", I'm just having a conversation with another user in this thread and he brought up a very interesting point, that 


And when I think about it, this is true because if the market does crash, and people stop buying them or accepting them as payment, you essentially have lost any and all money that you've pumped into them. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:05:01


Key word is **if**. At the moment it has an incredibly niche market which seems to be made up more of investors than people who want to use it to buy stuff. 
As for your point 


I'm not sure if I agree that this is a good thing. Currency is supposed to be a storage medium when it comes to wealth, a way to engage in transactions. It should not be seen as an investment, (especially a risky one). 
If I'm a merchant, I'm going to be reluctant to accept it if I don't have confidence in it's stability, because if I sell something for .5 bitcoins, how am I going to be sure that the price won't crash between the time I receive the payment and the time that I convert my bitcoins into my preferred currency? 
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:09:38
Maybe it might be a good idea not to take financial advice from a bunch of anonymous strangers on the internet regarding your investment strategies. 
Everyone here is telling you to invest, but here's the thing... it's a **currency** not an investment. There are lots of people hoarding them at the moment which is helping push the price up so quickly. Also, there is very little security involved with bitcoins, 50 grand is a lot of wealth to keep on a 200 buck computer hdd which could easily crash at the drop of of a hat, and all that money would be nonrecoverable. 
Don't make an investment just because it looks inviting. Study your ass off and learn all you can about not just bitcoins, but how currencies work. And once again, don't make financial decisions based off of the advice of strangers. (Seriously... I really hope you weren't planning on making for final decision based on what you read here!)
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:27:03
Ha, I loved the honesty of your edit. Well about a year ago I came close to getting a few gfx cards and converting my machine into a mining system but when the price dropped I lost interest and kinda forgot about it. But to be fair, factoring in the investment of the system and electricity costs I'm glad I didn't start mining because if the price hadn't risen I would likely of made a loss. (check out my cognitive dissonance :p)
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:43:45
Yeah but I think you might have missed my point. While they price in dollars, unless they have some sort of system that instantly converts any bitcoins paid into dollars and then pays them to the merchant, it's simply to risky for merchants to accept them, regardless of how they try and price whatever they're trying to sell.
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:56:59
Something that he didn't mention under the 'protection' section is that most currencies are regulated carefully to make sure that they remain relatively stable. 
Anybody who has studied high school economics can tell you that currency is not something that should be seen as an investment, but simply a medium which is used to store wealth. 
Nobody is regulating bitcoins though, people are mining and hoarding them, artificially pushing demand upwards at a rate that seems dangerously fast. At the moment it is relatively simple to buy and sell bitcoins, but I think the real danger will present itself if/when people begin to feel that they're having trouble selling them. Once the price starts spiraling down, nobody is going to want to buy them one day, when they feel that the price will be lower the next. And that is the ultimate danger of the speculative bubble.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:30:18
Money is constantly created and removed from circulation on almost a daily basis because most developed economies use some form of monetary policy in order to influence the inflation rate, or complete other economic objectives. 
The vibe I'm getting from most of what I've read over the past few days is that bitcoin confidence is not in using it for a currency so much as it is for using it as some sort of investment/get quick rich scheme.
Governments won't let their currencies collapse, because if the value falls they simply remove cash from circulation (usually by selling bonds or something) in order to help smooth out the value. 
Bitcoins don't have a system remotely like this in place.

Yeah, someone corrected me earlier. I haven't really read up on it for a while and I guess I must have misread/mismemorized that.
That being said, "everything" I said isn't wrong. I still stand by everything else I've said, regarding the lack of regulation, safety and accountability. If people lose confidence in bitcoins for any reason, they literally become worthless. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 11:23:55
Personally I don't own any bitcoins because I haven't found anything I've needed to buy that has made them seem like a better option than using regular money. 


I actually like that way of looking at things, except so many people here seem to be talking about it as a legitimate investment. If we were to combine your above statement with everybody else's incentive to invest, then I'd argue that bitcoins are literally no better than betting on a roulette table in a casino or something. (Any money that you are willing to gamble is pretty much lost if you don't win your bet after all.)
My prediction for a worst case scenario, though hopefully not too likely, is that if/when the crash happens, merchants will lose faith in the currency and stop accepting it, and it'll lose it's purpose and essentially become worthless. Perhaps it'll get replaced by some other digital alternative, but again this is only my prediction of a worst case scenario to contrast with your last paragraph. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:00:32
