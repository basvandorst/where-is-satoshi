My favorite charity is [International Justice Mission]( They rescue people from slavery and sex trafficking, and prosecute the slave owners so they don't just continue the practice with other victims. They work in 3rd world and developing countries where court systems aren't well established, and their work in prosecuting the criminals often lays the groundwork for a functioning justice system. They do great work.

The Federal Reserve ain't the slave, bro, they're the slave master.
Look at a dollar bill. What's it say? *Federal Reserve Note*. What's that mean? Must be part of the government, right? Nope, they're a *private bank*. And they control everything about money, interest rates, and loans. The US Treasury prints more money *when the Federal Reserve tells them to*. A private bank controls our money.

I'll openly say I have no knowledge of macroeconomics, but I'm a little skeptical lately of this. When you buy a TV or a computer, do you avoid buying it because next year you could get a better model for less money? No, you buy it anyway because you want to be able to use it now. 
And I really can't see any justification for why home prices are 10x what they were 50 years ago. Like, yeah, new homes are bigger and nicer, but that's a marginal increase in actual value that doesn't come close to the increase in price. (As seen by the fact that old homes are priced in the same general range as new homes.) Seems like the only reason they cost so much more is because lending became so massive.
I know debt can be useful to average people on an individual basis to be able to afford things they otherwise couldn't. But it seems like in the overall economy, inflation/lending leads to more speculative purchases and exaggerated prices, and eventually bubbles that pop. (Same thing with student loan debt.) Whereas with deflation it seems like it would push people towards making smarter investment decisions and discourage things from being overpriced. If people need or want to buy something they're going to buy it either way so it doesn't seem like the economy would suffer over time, but we'd avoid artificial debt-based growth and resulting crashes.
I know that's the opposite of the consensus among economists so if you can point out where my logic is wrong I'd actually appreciate that.

Yeah.... But "some people make less money than others" is not a pyramid scheme. A pyramid scheme is "the people at the top take all the money from the people at the bottom and the people at the bottom lose all their money"
The early buyers of Bitcoin aren't continually taking anyone's money. The value of their investment is growing but the only exchange they made was when they first purchased it. 
It's exactly the same as gold or stocks or property.

Actually, I think most of the infrastructure problem is due to cities making exclusive contacts with letting a major ISP use their infrastructure.

Its price is going up because there's a limited supply and demand is increasing. 
Not exactly clear on what you mean by "depreciating", but you might be thinking of "deflationary"? USD suffers from inflation, i.e. the purchasing power of a dollar decreases over time. Bitcoin is considered deflationary because its purchasing power increases over time.

Maybe. But I think there's a lot of distinguishing elements of the millennial generation, while idk what distinguishes Gen X's life experiences. Millennials have: 9/11 at an impressionable age, first to grow up with digital technology and the internet, massive student loan debt, and starting adulthood during a major recession. Boomers had hippies and Vietnam and the cold war and the civil rights movement and the moon landing. What unique and significant experiences did Gen X have?

When it reaches the peak, the price will stay at the peak. Unless people sell and the price goes down. But that's all the same way any asset works, wether it's gold or Bitcoin or stocks or property values.
Utility value doesn't matter. Nobody is buying Bitcoin because they plan to use it for transactions. Utility has very little effect on the price.
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:49:49
I would loan money if I thought it would be an investment that would make me more money in the long run than the correlating increase in value of Bitcoin. Like if you want money to start a business, and I see potential for it to be "the next Amazon" or something, then heck yeah I'll loan you money for that.
It's the same thing if you consider Bitcoin as base currency and altcoins as investments. No way am I going to sell my Bitcoin for USD, because it's relative value is increasing exponentially. I have, however, sold some of my Bitcoin for certain altcoins, because I think they may increase faster than Bitcoin. But I'll be pretty selective about which altcoins I buy because there's risk that I'd lose net value if Bitcoin outperformed them. However, if I'm buying altcoins with USD, I'm not going to be selective at all, because just about any of them are going to rise relative to USD.
So it's not that people wouldn't loan money if the currency is becoming more valuable rather than less valuable over time, it's that they'd be more careful about where/who they loan it to.

@_date: 2017-12-18 08:22:10
Um, we're frugal, not impoverished. Majority of millennials are *not* living paycheck to paycheck. 
And it's actually a brilliant thing about crypto that you can invest ANY amount of money. I put $20 in Ethereum in February when it was $13usd/eth. It really doesn't take much to gain significant wealth in crypto. (not that I'm rich off that $20 investment, but the returns turned pocket change into like $1000 in 10 months, which is nothing to laugh at.) Give it a few more years and who knows, it could buy a car or be a down payment for a house. And if the initial investment were even a few hundred to a few thousand (very feasible to do over the course of a few months), then it could be enough to move somebody up a whole social class. 
Getting wealthy in crypto is about foresight more than it is about how much money you have.

Hard to understand what you're trying to say (is English your second language?). 
With the way we use banks and stuff right now, it's a pretty good system for both storing value and for sending value. It's hard to tell the average person that Bitcoin is better, when it's more complicated to use it to send value, and price fluctuates so much that it can't be counted on to store value. So the benefits are going to be things we don't typically think about.
Here's one advantage I thought of when I saw that people were sending Andreas antonopolous donations the other day: You can publicly post your Bitcoin address. I can't do this with my bank account number - if other people have my bank info they can use it to withdraw money from my account and steal from me. If I post my Bitcoin address, anyone can send me money but there's no risk of any of my funds being stolen.
So that's kind of a small benefit, but there's probably other advantages I haven't thought of.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:24:42
Banks stay in business by lending money. It's profitable for them because they can lend out more money than they actually have (fractional reserve lending), which is only possible because the Fed can print more money. You can't just "print more Bitcoin" (aside from mining), so banks can't loan out Bitcoin and it's not really a possible profit source for them. 
Besides that, in terms of storage, they can't offer any more security than a wallet. Banks have nothing to offer in the Bitcoin system.

1) in a Ponzi scheme, by the time it gets to the widest customer base, the asset is worthless. In Bitcoin, once everyone owns it, that's when it has its greatest value.
2) value is being transferred *from USD to Bitcoin* whenever someone buys. If there's any losers here, it's people who keep their money in USD as the value of the dollar decreases in comparison to the value of Bitcoin.

It's not about "blaming" anyone else. It's about acknowledging that Baby Boomers had a better financial situation starting off in adult life than millennials do. Don't have student loan debt? That's a benefit. Don't have high rent prices? That's a benefit. Have a strong economy? That's a benefit. Of course it's possible (and not uncommon) to be financially successful as a millennial and of course that depends on personal decisions. But to be stable, millennials have to make more frugal and careful decisions than boomers did. They didn't have to think much about money; millennials do.

Lol that’s exactly when I bought in. Did not have the money or guts to buy a shitton. Just $20 worth. Not complaining though. 
And that’s kinda what surprises me about reading from so many people here who have so much regret. I understand the whole “gah I missed out on something huge!” feeling - there’s plenty of crypto decisions I can look back on with disappointment that I could have so much more money if I had made a different decision. But at the end of the day, it’s all free money. I’m not doing anything, I’m just sitting here and my accounts magically go up 20% in a week! Big picture, I can’t be disappointed when ONLY $100 falls out of the sky today instead of the $200 that COULD have. It’s literally raining money and I’m going to be greedy that I’m not getting more? I just can’t.

It's scary if it's following the behavior of traditional assets. Bitcoin is a whole new concept, so who knows if it will behave completely differently?
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:14:19
Bitcoin won't be the only blockchain asset that succeeds. There will be many others and people will likely diversify their holdings (especially if the coin for everyday transactions is different than the coin that's the best store of value). I think money in a decentralized system is going to be so much different than we can imagine, just like how the internet changed communication and information in ways no one could've imagined. (Two decades ago, who thought we'd be watching YouTube videos on our phones on the train commuting home from work?)
Early adopters vs late adopters does mean there will be a lot of inequality from that effect. But the same can be said of any monetary system. In the past, whoever created and controlled it had the power to decide how to distribute it. Now at least it's luck/visionaries/innovators that get to have an opportunity to have a dominant share of the wealth. If there's gonna be inequality, I'd rather it go to random people &amp; smart people than generational institutional powers.

I can't really think of a reason for banks to exist (at least on a large-scale like they do today) in a world of blockchain. We won't need them to hold our wealth securely, we won't need them to transfer payments to other people, we won't need them to keep records of anything if it's all on the blockchain, we won't need them to convert international currencies if things like ripple and Stellar are successful... Aside from lending money, is there anything else a bank does that won't be replaced by blockchain? That's going to be a HUGE change in the economy system.

Kinda what I'm wondering. If everybody's saying "Oooh look at that price rise! Wall Street must be pumping this with big money! And it's going to continue until Dec 18. And then it's going to crash!" Then everybody acts accordingly.... buying and buying, with the expectation of price increase, then as the 18th nears, everyone starts selling like crazy on the expectation that the price will crash... If people believe it, they'll act on it regardless of whether the underlying narrative is true or not, and it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Technically speaking, yes. But as a user, it functions exactly the same. The point is I can already send money to whoever I want, whenever I want.

Yes, I heard about Bitcoin silver's concept and thought "well that's not gonna catch on right now because it's against the interests of miners, but more decentralization would improve the integrity of the system".
If mining pools end up being targeted or distrusted, the incentive for decentralization will go up.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:34:39
Yeah. But at least this time it's open to anybody to get in on the ground floor. Usually to invest in something from the beginning, you have to be a venture capitalist with millions. Or if a country makes a currency, it's all the most powerful people in the country who get the chance to distribute the majority of the wealth to themselves.
So yeah, it's pretty arbitrary. But that's better than being guaranteed to only benefit the people who are already rich.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:32:44
Hmm, interesting take. Hadn't thought of that before.
But, I'm sure there are ways that the rich could write regulations so that it only affects small investors/users. After all, that's what they do with the tax code and just about everything else.
IMO it's a race between mass adoption and regulation. The more that everyday people rely on using it, the more harmful it'll be to the economy and the more public resistance it'll meet if government tries to enact stifling regulations.

Agreed. I see altcoins as investments over the course of the next couple years, I don't look at weeks or months. If they've got good tech, it'll eventually be reflected in the price. But none of them have had the chance to prove themselves yet and the market is full of speculation.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:37:25
Oh, that makes sense. So, the "value" of a coin that a buyer holds is somewhere between the current price and the minimum price it will be sold at in the future? i.e., if the coin will drop a lot in price in the near future, then the current market cap is very deceptive, because most people in the market wouldn't be able to sell their coin at the current price.

It's a "software update"/change; some people like it and some don't. The update will branch off from the old one and it'll be split into two chains- 1x the original, and 2x the updated version. So if you're holding coins when the split happens, you get coins on both chains afterwards.After the fork, miners and investors will drift towards one or the other, and one will become dominant. 
Of course, you also have everyone trying to figure out how to get the most profit out of the situation, so a lot of people are focused on short-term thinking. Everybody wants to get the double coins at the split, so everyone is buying now, and that's a lot of the reason why the price is rising so quickly. Long-term though, it won't make much difference, if one chain loses most of its value. But people who are very active traders hope to sell immediately, before price drops, and make a bunch of profit.
In basically any case of a fork , there's no downside to just holding on through the storm. You can ignore it if you're in it for the long haul. IMO, its not worth the potential extra profit to deal with the headaches of trying to guess in such a speculative market. I am going to buy some altcoins though, since they're at a low point right now as everyone is moving their money to Bitcoin. I only have a small investment, too (maybe ~$1000 total right now). But it doesn't matter - the returns are still be a heck of a lot of fun. I put $20 in Ethereum in February when the price was $13/USD... Now the price is $300. When I bought Bitcoin last December, the price was $760/USD, now it's ten times that. It's been fun to watch my modest investments become substantially-less-modest :D

Yes and no. I don’t think it’s going to result in the utopian dream of destroying every part of government. But I think eliminating middlemen in a lot places will significantly increase individual freedoms. 
Look at how p2p has changed other areas: Uber has all but eliminated the taxi industry - people no longer need to pay exorbitant fees to drive and can work at their own convenience. Blogs and other online forms of self-publication mean people have more options for news and information than having to rely on one or two newspapers. A tech-illiterate person can watch a YouTube video on how to upgrade the ram in their computer themselves rather than paying someone at bestbuy. All sorts of skills, information, business transactions are better for both parties when you get rid of a centralized middleman, whether it’s government or a corporation.
Now, I look at blockchain as a broader technology than just bitcoin, because it can do so much more than just be a currency/store of value: Record-keeping - how much do we rely on banks and government agencies is dedicated for that function? If blockchain creates an immutable public ledger, then we don’t need them any more. Cross-border transactions that automatically convert currencies will make it infinitely easier for small businesses and individuals to work with people in other countries, and it’ll increase tourism and travel. No more reliance on banks for converting. Smart contracts - i don’t even know enough about those to be able to fathom how they’ll change things.
So, will it make government obsolete or powerless? I doubt it. But any time you can facilitate interaction between two individuals instead of relying on a central authority, it makes the world a better place.

You know what happened in the 1850s gold rush? Most of the miners spent more on supplies than they found in gold (unless they hit a jackpot). It was the people selling pans and pickaxes, tents and blue jeans, food and alcohol that made good profits. They didn't look for the gold like the impulsive masses, they found ways to serve those who were.
Pretty soon everyone is going to be rushing into Bitcoin (or Dash or whatever coin ends up being positioned for everyday use by everyday people). If you can provide a product or service or expertise (blog or YouTube channel could be one way) to help those people who want to get into the market, that's where I think the biggest money will be (not that Bitcoin won't also be profitable on its own).

But in school you're told you're not allowed to help each other on projects and talking is bad. Life is so much different than school, and it's stupid that we make it seem like that's all that matters, and force people to spend a shit ton of money just to have a chance at participating in society (because it's almost impossible to be successful without it).

Riding out the storm will do you just fine if you're in it for the long term. Some people are hoping to make extra short-term profits with timing &amp; predictions (which may or may not end up being right). But if you're someone who prefers less risk and has the patience not to panic in short-term drops, there's nothing wrong with just holding it until the chaos is over.

This is where I always laugh at the “fake money/pyramid scheme” comments. The value of any currency comes from how many people use it and what the agreed value is. The only difference between Monopoly money and the dollar is that people have agreed to use one as money in real life and the other in a game.

Great, so the people who make the fork decide its price. (At least for long enough to collect money from it.) No wonder there's a new fork every month. Sweet gig.

What if we start a crowdfunding effort to raise money to buy the domain name? There's gotta be an amount they'd be willing to sell it, then we can replace it with something that isn't a scam. I'm sure a lot of people would be willing to contribute to help protect the reputation of Bitcoin.

How does one define “value”? More relevant is to ask: does any currency have intrinsic value?

Love this from Jeffrey Tucker of FEE. "Property records" could just as easily be substituted with "trust". Trust in accurate records, trust in being able to verify that people are being honest, same thing. And everything in society relies on the trust we have in each other.

Yeah, I'm a math-minded person but I can't wrap my head around how this works. Bitcoin itself is kinda like creating value out of nothing, but it's had time to prove itself. If a fork is considered by people to be an improvement, value should shift *from* Bitcoin *to* the fork coin.

Just remember not to spend any more than you're willing to lose. "Investing" in crypto could just as easily be described as "gambling".

I tried trading for a while, mostly for the entertainment value (I'm a pretty risk-averse person). I'd sense a peak coming, sell like $40, wait a day watching the price obsessively, buy in the dip, wait like three days watching the price obsessively for it to return to where it was. "Wow, that was like a 5% dip, and I timed it ok to get like 3% profit. Cool! I just made myself an extra.... one dollar and twenty cents after having the price of Bitcoin occupy a large chunk of my brain for a week..." (And those were the times that I actually made a profit) It got old real quick.
Meanwhile, my first purchase was in last December with $500, intending to hold for a few months. Checked back a few weeks later, then a few months later, saw how good my returns were, and decided to just hold indefinitely to use either as long-term investment or extra emergency funds. (Thought of it as the "oh look, there's money in my jacket pocket!" account.)
This summer I had unexpected expenses that drained brought my traditional savings account below what I was comfortable with, so I grudgingly decided to cash out some of my crypto. "Let's do the math... How much do I have in here? Oh wow, that's more than I thought! I'll cash out...$1100 of it. Wait, really? That's over double what I invested ��" And I still had another $1000 that I kept in. (Now grown to over $2000)
So, I try to keep up with the latest news whenever I see the price swinging and sometimes shift my investments accordingly (I do not regret risking moving $20 to Ethereum when it was first added to Coinbase at $13/USD), but trading is exhausting. And although I don't *really* consider it "savings", it's nice to know that I have some extra around (even though the amount is completely unreliable) and that it's earning way better interest than my pos savings account.

Figure out how to send cat gifs as attachments to Bitcoin and we’ll reach mass adoption by the end of the week.

No. And I sympathize that having kids makes things much more difficult. It seems like the same should hold true though - especially when you can buy in bulk for a family. What, from your experience, makes that not true?

If you have to bet between people being really really stupid, or really really genius, bet on the first one.

The difference is that consuming drugs doesn't hurt anyone. For cp to be produced, there's a kid somewhere getting f'd in the a. 
Now I suppose you could try to say that because of digital copies, catching one user doesn't solve anything. At some point though, decreased demand does mean there's less incentive to produce more.
Obviously, it's best to go after those producing and distributing it, but people who possess cp are part of the problem too. Their purchase requires that a child is being traumatized. I have no problem with them being punished for that.
(The morally gray part is when the FBI operates the distribution websites as part of sting operations to catch offenders... Ick...)

Adoption. Currency only has value if a large number of people agree to use it as currency. Kinda like social networks - nobody cares whether Google+ has better features, all their friends are on Facebook and it'd be too hard to get everyone to switch. But, if a better coin comes along and gains mass adoption before Bitcoin does, that'll be like Facebook beating out MySpace. In that case, Bitcoin would lose a lot of value.
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:49:47
In order to reach the level of widespread adoption required for that scenario, it would have to function as more than just a store of wealth (ie, practical use as an everyday currency)
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:36:22
I'm not 100% confident in my understanding of Bitcoin economics, but, since value increases when there's more demand, if it reaches a point where everyone uses Bitcoin, demand will stop increasing and stay constant, and the price will level off and become stable.

Would regulation really make it the same as govt-issued fiat though? The whole point is that the government can't control it with inflation. Sure, it's easier to transfer anonymously, but the average person doesn't care about that, it doesn't affect them. 
What regulations could govt's put in place that would effectively change any of its basic principles?

Why would there be a civil war? In any scenario, it would be the Spanish government that would initiate violence. Why would that be necessary?
Violence wasn’t justified in shutting down the vote, and greater violence initiated by Spain wouldn’t be justified in any other attempts to prevent secession.

Who requires you to get a job? Who *forces* you to work? Nobody? Then it's not compulsory.

If Spain considered it an “illegal” vote, all they would’ve had to do was say “we will only recognize and respect the outcome of the vote if Spain is part of the process. We will schedule a vote for X day, and will coordinate the counting of the results with Catalonia so that both our governments can verify the results.”
That’s not so hard now, is it?

Instead of saying the price of Bitcoin is rising in comparison to the US dollar, it's saying that the US dollar is falling in comparison to Bitcoin price.

There's rumors Amazon might be working on starting to accept Bitcoin. Get a major player like that adopting it, and I see it sticking around for good.
@_date: 2017-10-18 05:37:49
Making this more complex, though, is that major investment firms are starting to buy Bitcoin to add to their portfolios. Cripple Bitcoin, and it won't just be Bitcoin that crashes, it could leave a big dent in the economy.
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:10:06
Very possible, and something I've definitely thought of.
Another possibility is if the rest of the economy goes bad, major players who have invested in Bitcoin might an important part of keeping things afloat.
