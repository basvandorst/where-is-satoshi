Sounds like you're saying that it is doctors' fault that drug and insurance companies are able to pull money from patients. Rather, patients are charged by drug companies for medications, and by insurance companies for coverage should they need to pay for treatment at a hospital or clinic; the doctor is not involved in the price at all.
The whole point of medical school is to weed out those who are doing it with their heart in the wrong place, particularly those who want to be a doctor for the money. There's a reason that you need four years of intense undergraduate study followed by four years of medical school followed by between two and six years of residency before you can have your own practice: you have people's lives in their hands, literally.
Is the healthcare system of the United States imperfect? Yes, and very much so. An attempt was made to correct it with the Affordable Care Act, which includes the Sunshine Act, which makes it illegal for doctors to receive kickbacks for prescribing medications. Of course, there is the obvious workaround where doctors can receive payment to *promote* a drug, but these are publicly researchable on [this site](
I would be very careful in distinguishing between doctors, insurance/drug companies, and hospitals, because out of those three, you've attacked the one least responsible for the problems you discuss. I would guess from your posts on that you aren't American, so feel free to ask for clarifications on the American healthcare system.

I am very sorry for you that you have this view of doctors that is almost as far away from the truth as you can get. While there are doctors that have been bought by insurance companies, the vast majority of medical professionals are doing it because they genuinely want to help people. It's why I'm going to do it. It's why all the doctors I've interned with do it. And it's why most doctors do it.
Edit: phrasing

Not seen below this is Dyl telling me that he guesses it'd be great if Mcavee's prediction is right but he's mostly done for now and wants the cash on hand.

Consider the following: Dyl and I don't care about the money in our future profession; we want to become *doctors*.

He invested with his parents. This was probably a greater-than-usual percent of their portfolio.
