Call me whatever you wish,but I'm tired of people using that emoji like it's nothing.

I find this emoji to be rude.Especially when it's used by itself.Please stop.

Like it matters what we want...

Let me guess...You're saying that because that's what you want to happen and all negative news is fud.That's why i hate this type of mentality in crypto and hope that btc dumps to 2k.

Do you think it will ever go that low?!I just bought some BTC yesterday for the first time,but I would like to buy more,only I'm waiting for it maybe to drop a little.Even $2500 would be fine,but I'm scared that in the next months it will go higher.

Are there,really?I bought some BTC a few days ago for the first time at $3700.Wanted to buy more,only I waited for the price to drop.Inexperienced as I was,when I saw it dropping under 3k,I said no,not yet,because it's probably gonna go lower.Now I regret not buying something at that moment.I'm afraid that it will keep going higher and higher as many people heard of bitcoin lately.And i'll miss the chance with bitcoin...

That sounds so crazy to me.How can people think so far ahead?Or thinking about retiring money.Why is that so fucking important?Maybe I'm pessimistic,because I can't even think of myself being alive 10 years from now with everything happening,even if im young,but it's so weird how people can think that far in the future and probably ignoring what could happen along the way.

You bought at 19k,haven't you?
