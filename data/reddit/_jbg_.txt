US local numbers are available now. We're looking into mobile.

We're looking at providing "pristine" numbers at a premium, and also offering numbers for a longer term.

Or rather, trusting the software to keep your virtual machine separated from the other virtual machines on the same hardware, and trusting the administrator of the virtual server platform to a) be honest and b) not make any security mistakes.
A server colocated in a datacentre at least reduces the risk to one of physical access, which many datacentres will let you reduce further by placing your server inside a locked cage dedicated to you.

Not at present. We’re working on it!

We launched a new feature today: Enter two phone numbers, pay 0.005 BTC, and we'll anonymously connect them for up to an hour of talk time.
The first number gets called, and once it is answered we call the second number and bridge the audio anonymously through our system. Neither number sees the caller ID of the other, and once the call is over we have no record that the numbers were connected.

Thanks! :)

Will see what we can do.

We have no plans to accept any other form of payment.

We're investigating it, but I'm not sure what we can add to this space beyond what the likes of Twilio already offer. (Apart from Bitcoin payment, which could be enough of a reason to do it of course.) If you have ideas let me know!

We've added support for pristine numbers, and options to rent the number for shorter/longer periods. Enjoy!

Say you handed your money to a stranger to take to your bank for you, after they made you sign a contract saying they bore no responsibility if you lost your money. Say they then ran off with it and you lost your money. Would you be "done with money"?
Coinbase don't have a great reputation, and if this story is accurate then I'm sorry they've screwed you over, but with any hard, irreversible currency like bitcoin or cash you need to do a bit of homework before handing it to someone else.

I run a service that accepts Bitcoin payment. We decided that always waiting for one confirmation is not acceptable to us, so we took a more balanced approach.
We use statistical methods along with historical data to calculate, based on the transaction fee and the size of the transaction, the expected time to one confirmation. If it is within a reasonable bounds that we set, we provide the service immediately. If the expected confirmation time is too high (which is an indicator that the difficulty of a double-spend is lower than acceptable to us), we wait for a confirmation before providing the service.
In other words, you need to decide on your risk model. One the one hand, decide how likely a double-spend is, using the information available to you such as the transaction fee that was paid. On the other hand, decide how bad it would be if a double-spend happened. Weigh those two factors against each other and you have your decision.

We are!

If you believe that because some network operators advertised _Gigabit Internet_ you can now, as an ordinary Internet user, transfer a block at line-speed 1000Mbit/s between India and China, I've got a bridge to sell you.

Good for you!

We have a system that exchanges all the numbers at the expiration of their billing period with our provider, but as in most cases this period is one month, it is a bit of a roulette as to whether you will receive a number that has been used for this purpose or not.
We have quite a few numbers and as the use of the service increases the quantity of numbers in the pool also has to increase (as obviously we can't allocate the same number to more than one person at once) so I think the chances of the number being used already should remain relatively low. Only time will tell :)

I think $12k/month is a little outside the means of an _ordinary Internet user_.
