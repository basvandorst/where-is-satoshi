we all agree on the first 2, the problem is when the moderators are bias in the second 2 points you made.

Your missing it, the point is that in the conversion from one currency to another and over time the poor will have what little money they can retain grow in value rather then deflate as has ben historically what has happened, keeping the poor in poverty no mater how much they were able to save because they particularly suffer from inflation, not having access to the same market tools as the rich use to preserve their wealth. I am considered very poor (below poverty line) by my country and state standards, but i have been able to hold onto a couple of bits over many transactions, and now they are worth more then they were before. I mostly missed the huge rise and crash.

there are no new coins coming out after that, that is what i'm talking about, it wasn't referencing anything else, for all EFFECTIVE PURPOSES mining has finished mining new coins so its not going to be called mining at that point, because THE ONLY REASON its called mining is because it was an analogy nobody is actually mining anything, they are just processing and confirming transactions, which i never said would end. Its just a name and it will change when the importance of new coins is no longer its primary function.   i guess i should have added "generating new coins" to my post

wow ok that a economics question there, and in this joke thread isn't really the place for that, i would repost it under itself, neither am i the person to answer but i will give it a quick shot, but your question isn't really about bitcoin rather how would any fixed money system work in a closed group? (mentally use gold) prob like money systems do, except in this case a computer instead of a man is accounting the bank, nobody is getting middle-maned to death, and decreasing amount of new money (less and less gold mining in the gold example, no mater how much energy you put in you don't get more gold out over time, just less), while some fraction of coins are lost or destroyed by natural entropy? thats a pretty predictable picture of rising value over time after the initial growth phase at the beginning , simply do the nature of that system. do you imagine no one has asked this question before of the bitcoin geniuses we got, which you could have simply looked up and found both the answer and the context that your own question lacked to provide an actually answer to your query? and a better answer then mine? because you might be being confused by general economic theory rather then by bitcoin itself.

I get it, you don't have any sense of humor, these jokes are alienating and elitist because you can't understand them. I'm sorry my apologies. or maybe you just don't like people sharing bitcoin jokes on reddit? or just jokes you don't like? because you sense elitism when actually what exists are different perspectives then your own and unfamiliar framing of concepts? if you actually pointed out it a point of view that demonstrated a elitism perspective on any of it I would have zero problems, but just calling something elitist without any support is a fallacy.

Are you seriously writing comment after comment criticizing that he wasn't wearing a SUIT, and instead wore normal clothing? If you really want BANKERS in bitcoin that bad, enough to give up your own respect for yourself, and expect others to, maybe you should go put on your own SUIT and go speak at conferences yourself, instead of sitting back and telling someone else to conform to the stupid system of SUITS which ruined the world in the first place. As you are someone with great respect for SUITS I can't believe someone like you found bitcoin on your own, and am willing to bet whoever told you about it first wasn't wearing a SUIT at the time.

the internet is neither a good or a service? which is neither bought or sold in exchange of value? "As society developed, people found that they could trade goods and services for other goods and services. At this stage, these goods and services became "commodities." Commodities are defined as objects which are offered for sale or are "exchanged in a market."[17] In the marketplace, where commodities are sold, "use value" is not helpful in facilitating the sale of commodities. Accordingly, in addition to having use value, commodities must have an "exchange value"—a value that could be expressed in the market." 
serious question i am asking would like to know if it is correct/incorrect?
@_date: 2015-07-30 02:11:02
The "Barriers to entry" wasn't some problem introduced by "elitism" its a natural barrier to market for some people unfamiliar with the systems.

@_date: 2015-07-30 03:36:35
no. the current size of users is sufficient enough, or even if we lose half that is still sufficient for the whole group to profit mutually as a community exchanging the currency AND using it as a investment long term because of its finite nature. I believe more will adopt, but it is not necessary to add more people, only for those in to continue in their current activities. And the price the first ten years doesn't really matter (this is year 6). that's short term day trader thinking, the guys looking to make a quick buck, the people you are thinking the majority of us are, when in reality that is a small fraction of the whole, most are strictly "hodlers" who are "hodling" (slang for Holders/Holding who put the coins away in cold storage for long term) looking down the road for decades, who can afford to make the investment in the first place (ie, risk nothing you cannot afford to lose)
@_date: 2015-07-30 03:42:26
example "the internet succeeds more if more people participate and its value rises to all of those participants the more people join." that does not mean the internet itself is a "scam" just because it also has this factor apply to itself. Many/most human/tech systems gain value, or perceived value, the more participants join it. That does not make those activities scams simply by the nature of them gaining value through activity and use.

yes that stuff should be moderated. I'm saying your moderation (under theymos) is no longer needed, not that their should be no moderation. Your job is important but that doesn't mean your executing it well, or can under your current leadership. Like the lack of transparency of whats going on behind the scenes with moderation, and how you guys are implementing custom CSS without any updates to the users, or deleting stuff you FEEL is off topic, but maybe the actual users feel is on topic.
Edit: i have no prob with the under-mods, you guys do a good job from what i have seen, its the person handing  the rules you have to enforce is the problem. I'm sure you would prob do a good job moderating under someone who wasn't letting their own opinions direct the rules. I have also read many times from mods comments that you don't agree with theymos strong arming his points here, but cannot speak out or you will lose your position. That is bad leadership. I am actual am sympathetic towards you guys and the no win position you have been placed in.
@_date: 2015-09-02 20:13:50
Why was kicked as mod then? are you saying their was some other reason other then him expressing his public opinion?
@_date: 2015-09-02 05:33:59
I believe, as do many others that implementation of that custom CSS WAS misleading users, and the fact that they ran a "Trial Run" while the forking issue was taking place looks like serious censorship. Thermos runs bitcointalk which would by definition means he has employment which conflicts with his moderation here. You don't see rules broken, but obviously other people feel that way. Shouldn't you consider their position, being they are the ones being censored, and your are not. Its easy to say you see no censorship when your not the target of it.
Edit: I'm actually trying to change your mind here on the issue, not trying to troll the issue
@_date: 2015-09-02 00:30:53

The reddit rules and censorship are the same topic. Because they are there to prevent censorship and protect the users from manipulation.
If the mods removed a lot of comments from a thread, or even a whole thread, we have the right see that deletion. That is why its shown in the first place, and why that kind of CSS is discouraged because it can be used to conceal anything, which is what they did with it, conceal a lot of comments they deleted because Theymos disagreed with them. Not because they were against some rule. There was no rule about not discussing bitcoin forks before XT, that rule suddenly appeared ad hoc because Theymos argued it was an altcoin and applied that ban. Thats not up to him, or the devs or anyone to decide which version of bitcoin is legitimate. Thats up to the end users who adopt and must choose one or the other (in this case the miners) which will adopt because of consensus that everyone keeps talking about. That consensus cannot legitimately come out of censorship because it INHERENTLY prevents consensus because the public becomes MISINFORMED.
I saw what reddit looked like "un-moderated" Aug 16, and it was fine, looked like any other reddit, spam was downvoted and topics off interest and good comments and pics were upvoted. Then the mods came in censored everything they PERSONALLY disagreed, not just things they said were against the rules, but art and political cartoons. 
This upset a lot of people, because they felt they had made this space by contributing and that they were helping bitcoin by sharing links. Then mods turned against the users for financial gains for themselves and their friends, leading to a drama storm. Or that is how it appears because of their deletions misleading people.
Thats how hiding things misleads people and leads to general confusion because people can't have an open conversation, which is the point of reddit. 
And why we have these up and down vote buttons, and people have been using them I have noticed to fight back against this moderation, with the only tool left to them. I'm sure i don't have to point out the countless down voting you and others have been getting because you won't even recognize that the other side should have the room to debate. That is wrong. All sides should be heard. 
Theymos has clearly been rejected by the vast majority of bitcoiners available on reddit who asked him to step down using those pesky voting buttons that he can't censor. He should have retired like a gentleman and gone to focus on bitcointalk, and upgrading that site like he has said he would. 
He and the mods he has kept must act as his cronies or he dismisses them, which means they aren't good at their job since they must follow his rules and not say anything, over trying to help the users which is their real job on reddit.  He kicked out good mods who only fault was disagreeing with him. He doesn't have the ability to moderating public discourse civilly. You can see all this from the reaction across the subreddits.
In Practice Theymos should not have the time to run both bitcointalk and be the head moderator here on reddit. That is also mentioned in the reddit guidelines, not the take on more moderation then you can actually handle, and he clearly can't handle it if 12000 people subscribe to counter subreddits in a week because of the drama HE CAUSED through his own lack of ability to conduct a civil conversation. 
Running both major sources of bitcoin social networking puts him into direct competition with himself, which is bad in practice. You never want one person in control of so much media power that they can manipulate the major news. Thats a monopoly in practice which will lead to him choosing one site over the other. We would want one person who could spend all their time focusing on making that social network the best it can be. Not someone who isn't really around answering questions because he has a attitude, but moderates from afar without any transparency or accountability. He didn't earn his position. He does not have the skills to manage these networks. Go read his writing, that isn't moderate anything. Thats a hardliner opinionated person who is trying to push people around. And this isn't just my view, this is the large view right now across reddit that's being censored. Everything I have said here has been said literally hundreds of times now, and many of those comments were deleted. That doesn't make my position right, but it does show that he doesn't have leadership skills because it has devolved to this draconian situation. He has upset and alienated the general user base of bitcoin which shows up to discuse the news, and lost their faith. Because of censorship and his poor leadership. 
Just to get things strait, I'm not pro XT either. But they have a right to be heard and not to have their posts censored.
Edit: lots of cleaning up, spelling, clarification 
@_date: 2015-09-02 20:22:30
The scandal of the day was you guys, and so i'm sure it looked a lot better when you wiped all criticism. The "Mob" you call it is the users of reddit expressing themselves as they always do. You could take any upvoted posts and say a "mob" was behind it. The downvoted posts  and comments were downvoted because thats what voting is for. That doesn't mean they should be deleted because they express a contrary view. What if someone had found a real problem in bitcoin and it was censored just because you guys didn't FEEL that day that it was good or added new information. Or because Theymos FELT that is wasn't important. Thats a bad moderation stance. The mods shouldn't be defining for the rest of us what the content we share should be, that should be up to the people using the site. What about the art which was censored, or the political cartoons, that got the creator banned just because they satirized Theymos?
@_date: 2015-09-16 01:39:19
This is actually a far better line of thinking then just censoring
@_date: 2015-09-02 08:39:24
Your guys idea of "new information" is messed up and shows why moderation here is bad. Reddit has voting so the users can decide what information is important that day, not you. I think your whole moderation system should be scrapped. The day you turned off moderation was fine, I saw it, your moderation does not help us. There are way way better moderation standards you could set, and censoring posts you feel don't contribute is terrible because that defeats the whole point of reddit and why we come here, to see all the news other users think is important, not just what a select few mods think is important.

thanks for coming and providing context. I will look for video segment you describe. Its good to know that narrative wasn't as simple as this one slide makes it seem. STILL thats some sloppy reporting not to put on that side that USD CASH is their  financial tool. It should have been at the top of that list. If you had also included the fact that our military weapons and assets were basically handed over to them, and put the united state government on the top of that list as they should be because of gross negligence, then usd, then the others, that would have been actually accurate reporting. And i'm pretty sure illegal antiquity tade is higher then bitcoins entire market cap, which the UNITED STATES rich and elites buys the majority.

I'm supporting this project, I liked the idea, and I think it will help the bitcoin in general to have a tool like this available.

just want to say for people down voting this comment, it actually adds more to the conversation by having the blog post even if you don't agree with them, and you would rather have them coming here to clarify themselves then not.
edit: discrediting coinfire isn't a good position, you guys should announce outside legal appraisal from a trusted third party who would report to the community and try and reconcile legal problems rather then just attacking the credibility of a news source which has proven correct in the past on some maters. I want to hear you fixing/looking into legal problem for us users, not just trying to deny claims. That looks bad for us with limited information about the mater.

A raffle would be great, I'm sure i don't have enough to win in an auction, but i would kick in a few bucks for a raffle on the off chance of winning, because its for a good cause.

thats fine, but that doesn't reassure me you are doing the right thing, even if they are wrong, because you didn't address my other comments about what would improve the situation, or the fact that you have a responsibility to disprove their claims with more then just "he said/she said" that we in the community can review
