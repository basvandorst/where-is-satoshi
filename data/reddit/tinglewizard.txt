I thought this was a frogger game at first.

Isn't it the mining power that matter?

This article? 
You think that miners deliberately want to hurt Bitcoin and cause the price to fall?
You missed my point anyway. Miners can't force people to use a fork. If people do not wish to use a fork, it will die very quickly.

The only way I was caught out is that I wanted to place to buy and sell orders to potentially take advantage of the volatility and I ended up accidentally selling bitcoin whilst trying to make a buy order. Luckily I managed to buy them back at the same price. Always check before making an order.

What recovery?

I think if it goes below $3,000, it would be worth looking into buying. Below $2,000 would definitely be a good buy in my opinion, as the long term trend from 2015 suggests 2-3k right now. It might not go that low, but if it does I think it would be perfect for buying.

It's too much for the average desktop user without pruning and/or disabling incoming connections.

I wouldn't be surprised of a fall back to $2-4k. It would result in a perfect opportunity to buy.
