I see a lot of hate for it regarding the information it asks... but I've never had a problem using them.  There are a few things you can do to be more safe though, and those things apply to all exchanges.  The two things that make me feel the most secure are having 2-factor authentication on a REALLY long password, and as soon as btc hits by coinbase account, i move it to a paper wallet.  If you don't control the private keys to your bitcoin, it's not really your bitcoin.

Out of curiosity, how much have you lost or won in total, and do you consistently bet for one outcome over the other?  I'm most definitely never going to wager anything on future btc prices, but I am very curious about the btc betting culture.

Let's say you're walking down the street with a pocket full of diamonds and you walk by a cardboard box labeled "safe diamond storage".  Would you drop your diamonds in it?

No... I regularly spend a flat rate on btc via coinbase and price changes after the sale are confirmed have no effect on the amount of btc you receive when the transaction is complete.

Can't blame you for being curious.To answer your question: i was 5 years old in 1992 and i was addicted to computers.  I wanted nothing more than to be able to play multiplayer games with my brother without sharing a keyboard and screen (Whacky Wheels FTW).  If my 5 year old self had somehow managed to "find" $599 and was told that "email" would allow me to play a game from one PC, with my brother, while he was on a different machine, I'd have given the $599 up in a heartbeat (and maybe my film canister with my lunch-money in it, too).

I don't see how that relates.  I never said you lost money; i said "people like you" have.  In the box analogy, the box is the shady exchange, and you, with your 25-times-initial-investment, are the person with the pocket full of diamonds. I asked if you would use the box/shady-exchange.  I never said you have used one in the past.  I never said you lost btc to an exchange.

No prob.  I've also been wondering lately what the likelihood of using btc being more expensive than cc's would be, but I'm optimistic and like to think that the fees will be lowered if the value of btc greatly increases.

I've experienced exactly that in real life and I can assure you that those kinds of people don't have the required brain power to realize the same word is being used in two different ways.  Nontechnical people absolutely do not care about the technical terminology.  They pay us to understand it for them.  Head over to and read up a little if you'd like to understand them better.

I've been working in IT for a while now, have had many discussions with curious people about bitcoin, and even though they've heard "bytes", "kilobytes", "megabytes", "bits", "kilobits", "megabits", and "megabits per second" many times, not a single one has ever expressed in any way that they recognized "bits" from somewhere else.

Define *adequate*.

Remove Huobi from the equation, and LTC trading volume is suddenly down from $170mil to ~$50mil.  I'm not saying Huobi is falsely inflating their volume, but if LTC was that big of a deal, we'd see larger volumes on other exchanges.  The exchange with the next highest LTC volume is only seeing $9.3mil worth of traffic.

I don't think it really matters.  Nontechnical people won't understand regardless of what it's called, and technical people will understand regardless.

I think my favorite terminology related instance was when a client called to find out why his computer wouldn't turn on (as if I can diagnose that over the phone anyway).  The client had an all-in-one that decided to just not turn on one day.  He wanted to know right then and there what was wrong, why it went wrong, how much to fix it, and when he could have it back.  I gave him the standard response of "You'll need to bring it in to us for me to properly diagnose the cause - it could be any number of reasons; the power supply could have fried, the motherboard in it could have fried, or the CPU could have fried."  He must really have thought I was an idiot because he yelled, "it doesn't have a SEE PEE YOU, it's and all-in-one!".
@_date: 2015-07-10 18:13:08
Agreed.  I love bitcoin, but if it gets too complicated, i'm done.
@_date: 2015-07-10 21:01:42
Yeah... no.  If you can't provide proof for your claims, they will be dismissed.

So you're saying that I could make a few hundred dollars by investing in ltc, dumping $50 into creating thousands of dust btc payments, and cashing out my ltc before the dust got swiffered up?
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:37:50
Re-read the thread and pay attention to your first post.  You said tx's with adequate fees are not spam, then you said that even though thousands of tx's have the same fees (which you say are both adequate and inadequate), some are spam and some are not, not based on the fee, but based on whether or not they were included in a block.  That goes against your first post, in which you defend any tx with an adequate fee as not spam.  I understand you're trying to troll and turn people against bitcoin, but you're going to have to try harder.
@_date: 2015-07-08 18:39:49
Then the transactions you defended as not spam are in fact spam.   
@_date: 2015-07-13 16:36:58
that was because of a spam attack on the network.  that has nothing to do with adoption.
@_date: 2015-07-10 17:09:39
No nontechnical person will ever even know the size of their transaction in bytes, let alone try to calculate a fee based off of that size.

Can you explain?  Was the report a leaked/stolen internal report?
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:48:18
Since there are ~20k unconfirmed transactions, some of them from yesterday, with 0.0001btc fees, you're saying that 0.0001btc is *inadequate* since they have not been included in blocks.

I have multiple paper wallets.  None are password protected in case i die.  They are very well hidden.  Most of them are empty, but i made a lot at once so i only ever have to use them a single time each.  I also keep about .1btc in a wallet on my phone in case i go out and can use it.
