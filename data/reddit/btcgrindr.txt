Me too. Back to business as usual.

The silver lining of all this - at least bitcoin got tons of mainstream media coverage and hopefully a lot of increased awareness. Glad to see that your friend is waking up from the matrix :)

Sounds like those shady forex brokers that take the other side of their bum clients' trades and manipulate the price to stop them out etc.

I also recommend Localbitcoins or Volabit. The only thing with Volabit is that they have a 500 mxn/day limit w/o verification....and with them and some of the other Mexican exchanges you can't even complete ID verification as a foreigner. 
But Localbitcoins works great for withdrawals in fiat if you have a Mexican bank account or a prepaid card with a 'Clabe number' (essentially a combined routing and account number that allows you to receive direct deposits/bank transfers). And if your friend needs to deposit in fiat that can be easily done via Localbitcoins as well with a cash deposit at any Oxxo or a bank.

Definitely contact Lastpass. If I'm not mistaken they used to have a manual recovery process where you answer some questions such as when you started using it, what sites you used it on etc that can be used to get your account access back if all other options have failed. I can't find any reference to it now though. Perhaps if you explain your situation they will go above and beyond for you.

Pretty epic thread guys thanks for the laughs.

Hardware and paper wallets for 1k in BTC? You guys must be joking. Keep it on a wallet you control like Airbitz or on an exchange like Binance that supports forks if you're lazy and don't mind the extra counterparty-risk.

I had an airbitz wallet on android. I vaguely recall there was some sort of trick to it, but I sold my bcash so long ago I can't remember haha.

Let me know when u make the service I will subscribe to it as well :D
Cryptrader.com has a nice interface you can compare charts/market depth's of the same alt on diff exchanges side by side.

Yup, I'm American but I live in Mexico. I don't trust either gov, that's why I keep as much as I can in BTC/synthetic dollars as opposed to banks.

Figure out how much you want to buy in total then buy in small increments each day until you hit the total you want to invest (dollar cost average)
