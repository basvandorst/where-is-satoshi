Oh i'm not bitter. I know what things i'm good at, and vice versa. I feel my intelligence is fairly average... my girlfriend is an MD, and my friends tend to be PhDs, professors etc. I myself am an engineer of over 14 years of exp, including for crypto &amp; blockchain projects.
Now, my verbal fluency is not where i want it to be; thank god i can write well though. I have very strong visual and spacial reasoning skills. My numerical skills are somewhat lacking. I'm very happy with my linguistic skills (bilingual in two languages, and know some basics of other languages on the side). As a whole i feel average. I certainly know when i'm not the smartest person in the room. For that matter i rarely _am_ the smartest person in the room. But then again, i make sure i spend time in the right rooms.
It's an important skill in life to be able to assess your own wits with regards to those of your surroundings. It's OK to be unsophisticated as long as you're aware of it.
No, this community is not full of geniuses. Trust me, i hang out with them.

Oh yeah? And is it because you don't believe in a status quo financial system that you spend your vacations alone?

Sorry i'm not seeing the connection.
When's the right time to buy is a subject in its own right.
People losing money to FOMO is a totally different topic.
Yes, there might be a link between the number of articles claiming Bitcoin is dead, and it being the right time to buy, if you follow the "contrarian" trading philosophy. Although even Tom Lee says it's risky being a contrarian with Bitcoin as Bitcoin is very emotional market where people buy more when it's up, and sell more with it's low.. so the link is tenuous at best, and frankly you'd need to prove it with DATA.
How the fucking fuck does such a tenuous and unproven suggestion become the top fucking comment? It's called confirmation bias? What is confirmation bias i hear you ask.. it's when you see 1 instance that fits your theory and you claim you were right, rather than trying to disprove your theory and it still arising as being correct.
The amount of cretins on this sub is just fucking beyond me.

How far up your arse did this tenuous connection come from?

i rest my case.

I think this sub has turned into the worst sub on reddit. jesus fucking christ.
@_date: 2018-08-24 10:34:15
Oh the sarcasm card.. nope.. it's not sarcastic. Point to one element of the post that's sarcastic.

I misread that as "women and children first!"

no. just no.

Oh no good try but no this is not a high IQ sub. Of all the things, you're not going to convince me BTC holders are smarter than the rest. This is one of the most retarded groups of people on reddit, and that says a lot, because retards are on no short supply on the internet!
Or to use the PC term: unsophisticated.
@_date: 2018-08-24 10:39:46
See i have this strange ability to stay on point. This sub is full of idiots. Sweet idiots, but idiots nonetheless. Stop kidding yourselves. The sooner you make peace with this, the better position you'll be in.
Take care.

sounds about right ;)

that's why i've been keeping my eye on FUN. Everything looks good apart from the price though.
@_date: 2018-08-20 19:42:07
The top comment is totally irrelevant that's why. The article was about a real issue: people who've lots a dickton of money after having succumbed to incredible fomo.
What the fucking fuck does that have to do with when's the right time to buy?
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:36:55
sorry i'm no expert.. but what has the life expectancy of a currency have to do with inflation rate? This is suggesting that all fiat currencies end with hyper-inflation. But actually what is that figure?
I would have thought they go extinct because they get replaced with another. e.g all Eurozone currencies with the Euro, for example.

You know that most jobs are invented.. right?
@_date: 2018-07-21 06:34:20
Um.. haven't the people who shorted bitcoin been gutted like fish? Who in their right mind would short BTC after such a short squeeze?
@_date: 2018-07-21 12:58:08
The point is to confuse people. Most people are idiots when it comes to sexuality.. so may as well throw them off with weird terms so they don't even try.
@_date: 2018-07-17 11:18:53
such contrarians........
@_date: 2018-07-20 21:35:48
Yeah it's volatility is down that's why. Wait until it starts mood swinging again and you start losing &amp; gaining thousands in minutes again.

sorry but this is fucking ridiculous. There are patents for all kinds of shit out there. Looking for meaning through patents is utterly stupid.

The more people lose their bitcoin, the more HODLers there are, the more the value goes up, right?
Holy shit.

i love it!!! it points upwards on the right side!!! wooohoooo!!!! \s
@_date: 2018-07-21 03:25:07
Oh you don't be like that.
It's true though. Us humans like to organise ourselves in neat hierarchical power structures. Clearly we like working, and have little to no interest in, i don't know, retiring early, say.
What better ways to keep those hierarchical structures in place than creating jobs to keep each other busy. You try it! You can hire people tomorrow. The more people you hire, the more you boost your profile in the structure. The more people you can hire &amp; so on. It obviously helps if you're producing something useful with those jobs, but it's not a requirement.
Money is the blood that flows through all the cells. You'd think each &amp; every one of these cells have to be productive right? Not if you want this organism to grow. To follow this analogy, this organism is pumping at the gym and drinking those protein shakes.
Also worth reading anything [david graeber](
