I'm trading bitcoins in Argentina. In the last weeks I've received 3 messages from people wanting to buy them. Certainly more and more of us are discovering Bitcoin and its power.
Why should we have pesos sitting there, losing value when we can have bitcoins, gaining value?
@_date: 2012-12-13 18:20:47
As of today, blue rate is 6.51 and official rate is 4.89.

@_date: 2012-12-18 19:43:14
To start, you go to [Instawallet]( They will instantly give you an account to send and receive bitcoins.
@_date: 2012-11-18 16:59:41
That'd be an instant jump to $50+ per bitcoin.

I'm an Argentine and people don't know about Bitcoin. I could say we are less than 100 active bitcoiners in all the country. That's literally nothing for a 40 millon population country.

Just so you know, I wanted to clarify that this is not my work. I saw the link in a thread from the Bitcoin Foundation forums. I liked the designer's work and I shared it here so it could be more exposed.

I can't be sure, but it is not easy to buy or sell. That means the Bitcoin market here is not really big. There is eudemocracia.org, a few on localbitcoins and bitcoinary. No more than that.
@_date: 2012-11-30 23:13:20
Great. How much would be the cost and what is the shipping method?
@_date: 2012-11-30 19:45:17
Thanks for asking. All of those are good options. Let me add an option to the list that has been recently working well. I would encourage incoming tourists to use bitcoins as the way to exchange their money for pesos. There have been  many exchange made by foreigners already, because they find it to be the most efficient way. It's is win-win situation for both parties. They can trade their bitcoins for the best rate of exchange without withdrawal limits or bank fees. In exchange, Argentines are able to save and/or use a currency that is more secure than the peso. This is an interesting article to read about Bitcoin use in Argentina: [Bitcoin and dollars in Argentina](
@_date: 2012-11-20 05:20:11
Can you explain this in more details?
@_date: 2012-11-30 15:42:22
Their philosophy goes along with Bitcoin and I'm sure a lot of us in the community would like to thank Mozilla for such a great work during so many years. Does somebody know who we should contact?
@_date: 2012-08-28 15:48:32
You're right. You can either deposit pesos and sell the assets for bitcoins, or buy assets with bitcoins and then ask for pesos to be wire transferred. The third option is to buy and sell the assets without the need to deposit/extract real pesos.
@_date: 2012-12-12 01:24:43
I thought about that and it is a really good idea in the case of renting. And yes, the exchange of bitcoins for pesos is good for both parties.
@_date: 2012-11-05 15:26:37
Seems that you didn't really read. There is a link at the end of the post.

I used Paypal to buy bitcoins. Paypal used the official listing price to convert ARS to USD. That allowed me to buy some (cheaper) assets and earn some money.

Is there an easy way to do the same in the command line? Maybe a few lines in Python?

Well, that blog actually helped me a lot so I wanted to be thankful and make a small donation. I don't have a credit card so I suggested him to accept bitcoins.
Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2012-12-12 19:27:16
That is also what I thought. The problem is that selling so many pesos for bitcoins would take a lot of time, if possible.
@_date: 2012-09-25 14:51:11

That is a great idea actually. I've been contacting techo.org which is a very big organization with the goal of suppressing poverty in Latin America. They naturally don't know what Bitcoin is and ask me to pay using the regular ways. You can try contacting rafael.achondo which appears to be the treasurer.
I think that if we can explain these charities how Bitcoin works and that they can actually get worldwide donations they will be more than glad to accept it. After all, what can they loose?

What nobody realizes here is that Spotify doesn't provide its service worldwide. This is due to music copyrights and stuff that needs to be taken care of in each country.
I've created an account over a VPN in the US but when I try to pay, my credit card or PayPal would tell I'm from Argentina therefore not letting me pay for the service.
Bitcoin would allow anyone to pay, which is exactly what they don't want.

This is true. All bitcoin trading is based on the blue (black) dollar which is about [8.08]( Using a credit card to buy something is actually cheaper.
Bitcoin helps when somebody sends you money from outside the country because you get 8 pesos per dollar instead of 5 (using banks).
