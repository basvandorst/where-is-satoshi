Be careful, by claiming them you expose your addresses and lose privacy, and also always first.move away all btc to new safe location in case if the amtcoin wallet is a troyan and would steal btc while on the key you input... And ofc do not give it a HD seed

Socialism. When you run out of other people money to spend you start printing it out of thin air. So it is less valuable. So you print more of it. So it becomes less valuable faster. So you print it faster. So it devaluates even faster. 
So you print it even faster. So it plummets in value. And now you can't even buy the paper to print it on (happened).

Number of nodes is not that important, what matters is their perceived economic strength to bankrupt miners who would mine other chain.
Mostly worked with bcash, only 10% of users want it (also 10% of economy value) therefore it gets just 10% of hash rate, and without emergency diff adjust algorithm it would be dead in the water like "segwit2x" (the one other hard fork against Bitcoin)

Why would that be so important use case right now?
Feels a bit like moving goalpost, for past year it was moaning about that 1 usd payments
@_date: 2018-05-25 11:02:47
Important mistake:
The longest chain means the chain with most work done (looking at the difficulty of blocks actually mined) this is how of two chain with same number of blocks one is picked.
Even the chain with lesser number of blocks ksncan be picked.
Please correct eg by adding notes

Correction: people try to spend lack of value per 1 money, by printing more money which of course reduces the value per 1 Bolivar even further.
The gov does it because result of that operation is that the ones who print money are stealing the value from the ones that baghold Bolivar (citizens).

That Peter seems to be a known bcashers shill, attacking Bitcoin more or less. He might be against csw just because this is the current narrative of r/btc despite them loving the guy just year ago when they thought he will help them scam more people into altcoins bch by pretending to be Satoshi.
Just a warning, of course in this particular action it is right to call out the fraudster csw.

One downside with this is low privacy
@_date: 2018-11-06 02:46:49
Imo the best advice might be to prepare for any small payments, small shopping, by opening own ln channels now when network is not congested.
@_date: 2018-11-24 12:25:21
Look into their "bright ideas", like finalizing blocks that are 10 block old (not allowing reorganize then).
This "solutions" are intended to protect from hostile attacks by big hashpower, but in reality they make things worse and easier to attack. And they seem to not understand any of it or how blockchain works.
@_date: 2019-01-13 12:51:43
The summary makes little sense.
1. I run Bitcoin core on my phone right now.
2. Problem is not the storage. That is solved by prunning. Problem is cpu and download to initially verify chain
3. Tldr but if proposed solution is some utxo hash commitment then it is less secure by far
@_date: 2019-01-18 05:24:33
You don't even have to be majority, any miners can.
Just always try to mine: the real transactions meaning the ones you've got from network mempool, plus also 30 MB of random transfers between own addresses.
It costs nothing to do that.
@_date: 2019-01-18 05:26:29
Yes but we can have both, with scaling outside of blockchain itself.

@_date: 2019-09-21 08:30:47
What the hell, no.
Entire point of QC attack is to bypass these limits, such amounts of energy are no longer required.
If big Eno gh qc would be built (real QC able to implent ant quantum gates not just these simulated anneling machines) the Bitcoin signatures will be broken.
In modern Bitcoin still they need to be broken between time of spending from an utxo and the next block (or reprganized) since.before someone tries to spend received money the pubkey is not known, only hash of it.

There was now a huge bug allowing to steal funds from your peer, how ever it is fixed now. Was problem in implementations, not in the concept of ln.
@_date: 2019-09-21 08:34:22
Well "safe" is too strong. Attacker still has time between tx being published into mempools that he can see, and a block. Maybe even 1 or 2 more blocks perhaps he can pay for a reorg. So, to be on safe side let's say he has at most 4 hours (usually 20 minutes) to execute attack. So QC need to be big enough and fast enough to fit in that limit.
First attacks might start when they are below 3 days to steal very slow low fee transactions.

With friend we used bitrefill couple of times, it worked without problem each time so far.
They also accept Lightning Network which is very comfortable especially for instant transactions of smaller value.

Big blocks issue is mainly cpu time to process it, and also somewhat network bandwidth though network latency can be important for miners decentralization.
Too few nodes storing entire chain is in addition.

Point of view of people who are against taxes is:
Same excuse goes for mafia blackmail when they want money for protection. No thanks. Taxes are the means to get people.to pay for things they would never pay of own will.
For normal things the pot can be done by selling tickets, like when you buy plane tickets. There is a pot to build the entire air field and maintain it for billions, and it is done completely opt-in: only from people actually deciding to fly a plane. Not from everyone living in the area. That's fair.
