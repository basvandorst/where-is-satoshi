The LN node will have a BTC node as well. You will start with an onchain Tx to first fund the BTC wallet of your node, with those BTC you open LN channels with other nodes, this is also an onchain Tx. Whatever you put on channels become available in the LN, for paying or routing payments off chain. When channels closes the btc balance settles again onchain.

See Japan case, and you'll see -maybe- governments may have a real interest in not banning anything around crypto.
