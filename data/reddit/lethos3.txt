I don't get your point, 100 TPS at this point in history for a pure decentralized pow coin is an amazing feat, much better than &lt;10 tps, quite literally 10x.

Everything is a construct.
@_date: 2017-02-02 05:08:29
Disinflation ftw, future generations will not look kindly at the Bitcoin emission curve.

*''oh you think we joke when we ban bitcoin? bitcoin ban for one month okay?''*
do not underestimate totalitarian regimes and be glad they aren't after the miners.

I agree, we are seeing another Bitcoin project being turned into a for-profit altcoin like GreenAddress/Coinjoin**---&gt;**Darkcoin/Dash and Zerocoin/Zerocash**---&gt;**Zcash.
Its sad, I would much rather see it in action over Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-15 05:58:50
You are not wrong, don't forget they control the hashrate which means it makes them think they have majority power over the Bitcoin protocol and should dictate key aspects of the protocol, that being said we need bigger blocks and I would be more confident running a forked version of Core that hardforks to 32mb blocks than the current BTU, but I'll move to BTU if they activate.
@_date: 2017-03-07 06:36:40
some of the negative comments are just downward ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:10:44


I feel well hedged. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:30:01
but which side would he take?

Said that a long time ago, the bubble was in 2013/2014.
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:06:34
Bitcoin is nothing without miners, unfortunately you and others like you will understand that the hard way.
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:34:38


For everything else, there is Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-08-06 16:54:45
Please use the correct name, Bitcoin Cash, as BCash is an upcoming shitcoin forked from Zcash.
@_date: 2017-08-06 16:33:43
People will be very happy (not), when they discover 10-20% of their mBTC goes away to the miners each tx.
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:37:22
It could have been a group and after "Satoshi" devised the concepts and the initial algorithm they ran away with the code and launched the notorious and now defunct bytecoin scam.
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:48:23
changelly/hitbtc/cointelegraph are part of the same cabal of scammers: 
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:35:30
RIP Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2017-08-06 16:35:02
Bitcoin Cash finished 98% of the shitcoins out there, Ethereum is one of them.

Segregated Witness is one of the most interesting developments from Bitcoin in years, it doesn't make sense not get activated.

He doesn't need to do anything special for crypto to flourish, just stay far away, as government the US can get pretty nosy.

Ignorance in certain matters is both stupid and malicious but of those not ignorant I think only groups with their own agenda with little regard for the people that use bitcoin and need to wait hours for confirmations on the network would be malicious enough to go against, maybe there are security issues I don't know about but I haven't seen anything convincing. SW is an upgrade at protocol level Bitcoin has not seen in years, ever since Satoshi left I would say.
@_date: 2017-04-01 14:30:52
After reading [this]( LN does not sound like a good idea. There is compelling logic it will take us back to square one in the big picture.
@_date: 2017-04-01 11:49:46
Sounds more like a dystopic nightmare. And who controls and deploys all of these thing? The government. You can't hold your private keys, you have no privacy and nowhere to hide from the government, good luck India.
@_date: 2017-09-23 03:52:01
and Bitcoin wouldn’t exist.
@_date: 2017-09-22 20:30:10
But which Bitcoin? LOL
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:58:15
Cyprus just went full Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2016-10-03 22:55:59
Nicolas van Saberhagen mentions this Satoshi Nakamoto guy in the Cryptonote whitepaper so I think he is a bit important too :-)
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:16:00
You can't compare Ethereum to Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a lot more stable and blockchain growth linear.
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:50:27


@_date: 2017-07-30 21:41:19
If you think the rules apply to them you are being naive.
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:50:01


You are confusing Bitcoin with Peercoin.
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:40:49
protip: zcash is almost [useless](
@_date: 2017-07-26 13:39:03
People said exactly the **same** about Bitcoin in 2009.
@_date: 2017-07-17 04:34:55
Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency. Monero is the first decentralized cryptocurrency (fully fungible).
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:09:54
It's worse than that, there was a premine of 72 million coins out of ~90 million in circulation, Ethereum is now one of the biggest scams in history.
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:53:43
If its in an exchange its not yours, how many times this needs to happen?
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:30:42
If Bitcoin had Confidental Transactions and Coinjoin by default from day 1 achieving considerable privacy like so many people in this thread want the blockchain would be over 1TB in size today, your other points are not wrong, I just think its a fair trade-off, and there is work being done at this moment to reduce tx-size.
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:21:58
This kind of lenience is the reason this world is in such state.
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:58:06
Bitcoin Core does **not** scale better, it cannot even handle past 3 tps currently. Monero has dynamic blocks that worked fine and will continue to work. It's probably better to research the mechanics first before making incorrect statements.
@_date: 2017-07-29 22:46:36
It was 12 million going to the Foundation and 60 million offered via ICO.
These facts were well buried, like their emission curve.
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:16:00
yeah well that's just like your opinion man.
@_date: 2017-05-11 14:07:07
Who cares about China anymore? Japan completely dominates the market in Asia and with real volume and merchants backing it, all we need is to move mining out China now.
@_date: 2017-07-26 13:06:27
it has dynamic blocks so its one of the best chains for scaling.
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:31:13
yep, that's how it happens.
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:29:52
To piss off trolls I imagine, I think some people just want to see Bitcoin scale on-chain, also he already said what is his favorite coin outside of Bitcoin (not Eth or Dash): 
@_date: 2016-07-04 06:20:59
Even if was true I would take that over dASH.
@_date: 2017-07-17 04:33:56
Because no one uses it LOL.
@_date: 2016-07-04 06:41:31
Yes I've always found halving "unnatural", if we were to go back smooth block decreasing would be preferable.
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:41:28
I have a very simple list of what any non-scamcoin should have:
- fair launched (usually announced in public forums and/or mailing lists with hundreds to thousands of witnesses)
- no premine, no instamine, no devtax, no ICO
- pure PoW
if the coin matches all these aspects it is not a scam (at least per [FinCEN]( guide-lines)
@_date: 2016-07-20 02:24:54
I remember the 42 coin, surprisingly it still around (cryptopia).
@_date: 2016-07-04 17:29:33
Are you implying the 21m cap should be removed?
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:49:30
the facts stand on their own, you should research any criticism of monero and any criticism of other coins for yourself before believing in anything.
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:58:33
Gold has inflation, emission-wise Bitcoin is not like gold at all.
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:53:15
anything can go up and down in a free-market, they are abusing the lack of regulations in the space so far, really don't want to go against your gains but I tend to follow a strict code of not messing with questionable people and/or projects.
@_date: 2017-06-25 00:20:35
it isn't, i'm only speculating how it could play out.
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:32:44
its a joke, a shitcoin, but not a scamcoin, most scamcoins are shitcoins tho. A example of scamcoin that is not a shitcoin is bytecoin.
@_date: 2016-07-06 09:01:16


Did Satoshi used his Bitcoin to buy something, are his Bitcoin being used? They answer to both is no and are the reason he can't be traced.
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:45:09
it falls officially as scam in many jurisdictions and as shitty algorithm to secure the ledger
@_date: 2017-07-26 13:34:35
Please remain skeptical as Monero tps surpass Bitcoin Core cripplechain in the next years.
No one is saying it can scale to 1tb blocks if thats your concern, at least not now.
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:50:41
Looks like the RemindMe bot is not working in this sub, please mark 2020 in your calendars.
@_date: 2017-06-24 21:27:52
I wouldn’t dismiss the idea so fast, Ethereum is proving there is a lot of dumb wanting to support centralization. In fact I have long believed the only thing that could de-throne Bitcoin would be a national cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:36:40
Everything without a round logo, PoW and fair-launch is a scam. Monero, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Monacoin are rare examples of non-scamcoins nowadays.
@_date: 2017-06-24 23:34:06
yeah but the kind of national crypto I mean would be one exactly like Bitcoin but controlled by a central bank, they could unwind transactions and dictate the emission curve at their discretion, exactly what we got in Ethereum but backed by a government instead of some random guy.
