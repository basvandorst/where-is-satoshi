Bitcoin is not money ON the Internet it is the Internet OF money.  It does to money what email did to written communication: make it global, nearly instantaneous and almost free.

You don't give a cash tip to the establishment and ask them to process it for you out of convenience or familiarity, though. You give that directly to the server. Why wouldn't you tip bitcoin to the server in the same manner? 
@_date: 2014-07-31 03:46:29
Bitcoin is cash+, and obviates the need for simple cash. If the server showed an address - say a qr code tucked in the check presenter, then you can tip them directly. No need to involve a processor as there is no closed system to Bitcoin.

Cue sad tuba sound. :-(

I did the same thing once and I got it confirmed by politely asking a mining pool to confirm it. Here is what they said: "Since this txn appears to clean up a lot of small inputs I've gone ahead and set it to be included in Eligius's next block."
I don't know if they will do the same for you but you can try by opening a ticket with [eligius.st/support]( If that didn't work I planned to attempt a double spend with the correct fees. If that was unsuccessful I think the only remaining option was to wait for the original transaction and double spend attempt to expire from the network then retransmit with the correct fees. So if all that wasn't possible I was going to chalk it up to tuition for a learning experience. Fortunately [St. Eligius]( came to my aid. ;-)

Identical scenario happened to me about 12 minutes after you. 
So much for gifting someone a few millibits to get started. He's "not so sure about this Bitcoin now" ಠ_ಠ

I think I can guess the answer to this, but I'll ask anyhow. Do you have Time Machine configured on your Mac? If so, you may be able to restore the multibit data directory to an earlier version when the wallet was still there.

Looks great! Only suggestion I have so far is how about a bitcoin: link and a QR code for the bitcoin deposit address?  
@_date: 2014-07-30 22:24:34
But why don't you tip the server directly? Why involve a processor at all? 
@_date: 2014-02-20 23:47:44
Same here. I have my first gox withdrawal scheduled for tonight which I expect will go smoothly. I even did something stupid which required an email to support that was quickly addressed. A1+++ will use again :-)

Good point. Another reason to use CoinJoin and DarkWallet's stealth payments.

I think that the old [ATT "You Will"]( commercials ported to bitcoin would do nicely. Something like: Bitcoin - "You Can" 
"Have you ever bought something online ... without sharing any personal information? Trusted your savings ... to a piece of paper? Moved a million dollars ... without anyone's help? You can. And the technology that enables you to? Bitcoin."
"Have you ever split a food bill ... without getting out your wallet? Paid the lemonade stand ... using your phone? Supported a worthy cause ... through a picture? You can. And the technology that enables you to? Bitcoin."
"Have you ever given spare change to a stranger ... for a good comment online? Carried all your money ... on vacation with you? Sent money securely ... to the middle of a war zone? You can. And the technology that enables you to? Bitcoin."

So far everything works good. Thanks! Only feedback I can think of for now is how about an easy way to invite people to the service?

You can transfer it to a Gox wallet. Gox wallet to Gox wallet Bitcoin transfer never ceased. I asked for a funds withdrawal from BitcoinBuilder and the Gox coin I bought there were deposited into my Gox account.

One of my first purchases with bitcoin at the end of last year and I couldn't be happier with it. Thanks @_date: 2014-08-18 14:40:19
Yes. Like an "anonymous" email address.
@_date: 2014-03-22 18:00:07
Also beware of concoction malleability.

Individual bitcoin wallets can be hacked, but the system itself cannot be hacked. Andreas addresses this repeatedly in his education of the Canadian Senate.
 
See  for a good example.

Excellent. Also, I am looking to trade namecoins, any plans to include nmc in the future?
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:25:21
Same here.

Every time you refresh, it generates a new address, so be careful. It worked for me on the second payment. Also, I would prefer to know the duration of the film before purchasing. This one is 9:32. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 14:19:11
 I like it - especially the title. :-) Double SHA256 (like bitcoin uses) would make it

I've been using Lawnmower for a couple of weeks and it seems legit so far.

Lawnmower.io is my new favorite.

This post is so full of win! Please give us more details about how the person was using BTC, like what's the phone/computer/Internet access situation for the average Afghan selling stuff at a Bazaar? 
+roll verify
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:14:25
Yes, please! I've been waiting for this, and I suspect I'm not alone. Use [multi-signature]( for escrow if possible.
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:17:38
Just keep trying. I needed more tries than I bothered to keep track of and I haven't moved in 4 years.
