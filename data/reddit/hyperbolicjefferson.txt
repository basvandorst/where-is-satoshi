My favorite is how bitcoin somehow wins every time versus real currencies.  Even I draw the line somewhere with rhetoric.

Sorry I accidentally cropped out the x-axis [labels](
EDIT:  I hope I have successfully made you feel as stupid as you are.  Now go ask your parents how apocalyptic the 80s were.

And that's great but, setting aside a number of things for the moment, cherry picking double zero roulette isn't particularly going to win me over.
To use your own source -  
You asked what has better odds?  There are a number of better options in the first table on this webpage.  The most obvious is Blackjack.  The most notable, in our case, is *Don't* Pass.  
I also think you should read the definition of house edge.  It is important to distinguish the difference between the house edge (a ratio containing an average) and the probability of an individual event (true odds) given that what we're really talking about here is the probability, or true odds, of an individual bet.

And that's how the average consumer looks at it but it's not how "we" look at it.
A gallon of milk costs something completely different where I live than where you live.

This comment is awesome

This is where the BTC community gets off the rails.  They're looking at it as a payment system because that's the most valuable part of the technology.


No, it won't.  I really wish we could get that kind of nonsense out of here and all finally agree on what Bitcoin is.  You are insane if you think BTC will ever *replace* fiat currencies.  It would require a global apocalypse to take place.

Good thing because I was going to need more than one

Let's use your numbers.
1,200,000,000,000,000 / 10,000,000,000 = 120,000 satoshis per person, in a utopian completely even distribution.
Now let's compare that to USD, not value wise but amount of currency wise.  
120,000 ---&gt; 1,200.00
That doesn't sound like a lot of buying power.

Most reasonable post I've read.  Way to not be a faggot.
@_date: 2013-09-16 14:45:56
But aren't we supposed to be anti corporation?  Aren't all companies out to screw us?  Why would we give them the power?  
I DONT GET IT!
And isn't there a fee for services with bitcoin too?  So merchants get to pay either card services companies/banks or bitcoin services companies / exchanges?  I guess that's a choice?
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:13:22
What kind of circular reasoning are you employing here?
People should use bitcoin so that people can use bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-10-05 12:07:43
This is how you know you are insecure financially.  This site is down and there's no where to get updates on what is taking place or why it is taking so long.  I am entirely cut off from my BTC right now which is nerve racking.
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:25:54
I cannot upvote this enough.  Bunch of retarded kids in here.
@_date: 2013-11-01 05:07:57
I'm assuming something like [this]( is what you mean when you say the dollar has already collapsed.

Just to nitpick, GDP isn't just output and Net Exports are a component of GDP so you're being redundant.


I can't, because there are not enough satoshi's to go around.  Bitcoin is finite and only divisible to a certain point.
Look, all you guys are thinking about this wrong.  You've been pulled into a great technology that does have a lot of huge potential for changing things in our world, but you ignore the fundamentals (such as trade, capital flows, and the fact that fiat currencies underpin the world, you would have to unmake the world entirely to create your ideal) when you idealize situations like someone buying something from another country.
It's just not that simple, and it never will be.
@_date: 2013-10-05 11:54:51
No it's not

If you set a point you have to hit that point in order to get paid.  I don't think you're taking that into account.

No it won't.  It will always be measured against currencies (exactly the way it is now), because that is how currency values are measured in the marketplace.
