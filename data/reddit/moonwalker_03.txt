Fees doesent matter. The price of bitcoin is dependant upon hopes and dreams. Not the content of the actual coin. That's why there's so many skeptics who say it's a bubble. Bitcoin can definitely rise because people have very high hopes and dreams.

Do not think years I'm advance. Consider the fact that this could be a bubble and one day it will burst. I strongly doubt it'll burst I'm a few weeks but definitely could once dumb money finishes in  a few months.
But be careful with your investment man. Watch it move up and down and know your peak and leave when you can and then forget about it. It might rise again after you leave but you'll be so much safer

What I meant was it's too stressful to do day trading and I really don't have the capital for even one btc. So trying to build that capital with day trading would be so stressful.
And oh yeah I know I can make a lot of money if I put in one btc. But I started work a few months ago and I have genuinely put in all I can haha.
Good luck trading. You prolly don't need it though

The emotional ones sell as soon as they see a big dip. In the long run the emotional ones never survive. More so if they take risks like me and invest using CFDs.

I lost mainly on when Bitcoin crashed to 5500. I had set up CFD positions at 6800 because I thought that was the crash (7200 to 6800)
I also lost a shit ton of FOREX. But yeah. I then turned 111 into roughly 500 in like 2 weeks. By learning.

Exactly. Buying with CFD is higher risk but I just dont have the capital to earn a decent return on this without it. So higher risk but hopefully higher return

I've put in the money and I wont put in any more. If I survive the next 2 months with my investment intact, Its possible I can make 50k or so if the market goes up by 10 times as is predicted by many.

1. Why does everyone say hodling?
2. Wow you've made a good bit of cash. The only problem is I dont have that much of a capital so oh well. Plus I dont think the stress is worth that much

The very likely prediction is ( by following the trend) the price will soon touch 10k. when it does that, even if there is a 2k drop in price with a crash after that, my investment would still be safe because my investment will start to go out at 7615 . 
Ofc I cant beat insiders. But day trading is too stressful for my heart and it hurts to make a mistake. I'd rather value my mental health more. I've invested 600 dollars in total. Honestly, I can afford to lose them. I just really dont wanna. Even though it is most of my savings, I can afford to lose them since I only just started work

Not too surprising. The price has increased too quickly. So what I've done is sold off some of my investment in Bitcoin because I am also expecting a major dip
