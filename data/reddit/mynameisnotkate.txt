Thanks Zomdifros, I have two-factor authentication enabled on blockchain.info, dropbox and gmail (and am keeping a wallet backup in both location).  I use 1Password to generate strong random passwords and have just blocked access from TOR (thanks). What do you mean by use double encryption?  Appreciate your help.

Good idea about using Linux without persistent data!  Thank you CoinWhisperer.

Thank you Anenome5, I'll checkout the and will make the move to a cold wallet as soon as I can figure out how to do it securely.
There seems to be lots of different ways to achieve the same outcome, but it is hard to know what is the safest option.  I thought blockchain.info would be okay (as I always hear people talking about the blockchain) but I guess it isn't that simple. 
Thanks again for your help.

Thanks for the explanation about how blockchain.info works.  To clarify, I currently have approx $700 worth of BTC and plan on purchasing an additional $200 or $300 every month.  It sounds like paper wallets are the go ... and I guess a bank vault or something to keep them in (which is an amusing idea, using a bank vault to store a paper version of a digital currency).
Could I set up one paper wallet and then keep adding BTC to it? Or would I have to make a new one each time?
Thanks again for your thoughts.

Yeah that is kinda what I was thinking originally, but it seems as though many are recommending paper wallets - so presumable there there are other ways that someone could steal my coins from blockchain.info?

Cool.  So I use bitaddress.org on a offline computer to generate a paper wallet, then I can lock the wallet away somewhere and keep adding to the balance overtime - while monitoring the balance on blockchain.info.  This is great, I really appreciate the pointers.

Thanks, I hadn't noticed the double encryption option, I'll enable that now.  At this stage I won't be doing stuff with bitcoins on my phone, but will keep that in mind if I start to see local shops accepting bitcoins.  
Appreciate all your help.

Thanks TheStygianSun, I think cold storage might be the go.  While I think my computer is pretty secure, I'd rather not risk $$$'s finding out! 
Is there a recommended or standard way of going about setting up cold storage?

In order to get access to my email in the first place, they'd need to deal with the two-factor authentication. They'd also need my wallet password (as the backup that blockchain.info sends is encrypted).
