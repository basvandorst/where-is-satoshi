Will 2018 be the year for stablecoins? We're really starting to feel the dark side of crypto volatility

Terrible. I lived it myself. And I do think cryptocurrencies can help... just not the ones imposed by the same goverment that screw everything up in the first place

What other stablecoin alternatives to Tether do you know? I only heard of Digix and Globcoin (on ico phase)

You mean credit card specifically... or the credit-system in general?

Eventually banks will embrace Blockchain and use it to their advantage (don't know about BTC specically tho)

If the problem is that YOU sold... why hating the person who told you to buy?

Anyone else thought the percentage would be higher?
@_date: 2018-03-22 12:43:25
Yes absolutely! sorry-fixed

Well isn't Ethereum Blockchain more energy-friendly? I agree that this is a huge disadvantage of B. technology, but I have no doubt that it can be worked on in the future

Korea is becoming a huge market for cryptocurrencies. We were surprised to have an overwhelming amount of koreans visiting the ICO website

Then the internet will become very expensive

Great article. Too bad you missed GLOBCOIN on your list. If you have time you should check our their project and how they are "bringing stablecoins to the next level":

Crypto things are going mainstream and we better get used to more and more "unrelated" celebrities saying something about. We might as well smile and leave them be

Funny that it was a success but the event went unnoticed by the local press.
@_date: 2018-02-18 13:42:21
When will cryptos start developing their own cards? Instead of alliances with visa/mastercard.
Do you think it will happen soon?

Good question. A good read on the subject (although written for an ICO but still) a World Currency vs a Global currency:
