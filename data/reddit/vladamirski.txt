Friends keep making fun of me for being obsessed with bitcoin. 
yah you must be salty now losing $16 on your amd stocks. 
I'm up baby, I know you are jealous
(Before you roast we're on the highschool poor grind and we were both getting 5 and shares in January but mine wouldn't go through so I invested $30 in btc and I'm boolin)

@_date: 2017-12-11 16:10:21
Nah but I always have to correct her when ever she says crashing that it's stabilizing. I honestly might get a hoodie that says stabilizing or something crypto related if anyone has links 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:52:01

My friends at school complain that I'm getting annoying with me "stupid nothing currency"
"Why would you even bother buying .01 that's like nothing"


"Bitcoins gonna crash and you are gonna cry" 


@_date: 2017-12-21 04:21:10
anyone got a link to the fiver gig?
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:08:30
Yeah. I mean I kinda felt like I should diversify a little (maybe throw $20 in ltc since that shit is spiking) but transaction fees for btc is too damn high right now.
I also already accepted loss if I have to with my btc. I only put in $30 and we're up to a couple hundred so I mean.. it's a long gamble you know? I'm okay with riding it out because even if I cashed out I'd buy something really dumb and never touch it again (highschool mentality ) 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:35:02
can't relate, they just tell me to shut the fuck up because I'm gonna go broke... 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:54:21
I bet you believe in santa, knucklehead

Tbf it's high school
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:19:25
Only invest what you can lose. Maybe cut off eating outside and cook for yourself every now and then and invest that. It takes time, it isn't overnight. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:54:22
Same boat. I remember putting $30 in earlier this year in rage cause I was salty my bank would overcharge me for amd stocks.
Turns out I really hit a home run on it!
also I became crypto kid and my teachers make me give a Bitcoin update everyday 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:40:52

@_date: 2018-10-29 13:02:49

this is so true this is all I saw at school on Friday because Bitcoin was on CNN student news and my teacher was trying to explain it to everyone but she was getting it so wrong and it made me cringe inside the way she was explaining it 
@_date: 2017-09-10 00:58:19
good luck my man! i'm 16 too and i put $20 in a month. It aint much, but its around 1/4 of my survey money a month that I just have investing so i dont buy dumb shit on ebay. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:08:45
I did explain it and my friend might be putting his paycheck in (high school job, maybe $200 t most but that's alot for us kiddos)

They only take btc? Nvm then lol 
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:59:32
180 btc? Holy shit. If only I got into this earlier. I mean ive been into it since like 2013 but I couldn't really do much about it because I didn't understand it even with videos and asking your parents to get you Bitcoin for Christmas when you are like 12/13 would sound sketch to em 
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:57:00
My dad's still laughing at me when I went in with like $40 at $2400 ish.
Now he is begging everyday for me to give him some

I'm a junior, I was supposed to get like 4 shares of amd before ryzen and Vega and my bank wouldn't let me for whatever reason so I was salty because my friend had 4 shares
 
I put most of the money like $40 into btc and here we are. I'm not the salty one anymore, my friends salty at me. 
Actually I'm kinda salty I didn't buy more at ~3k but whatever this is still really good.
happy holding everyone 
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:14:55
Yeah. I'm a wee junior in high school with no job and $40 brought me here so :) 
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:18:21

@_date: 2018-12-16 22:13:49
I remember watching the price skip through 2k like nothing in class and losing my shit
$5 to like 50 was cool
