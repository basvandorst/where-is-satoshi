To pay out people who took the risk of leaving any assets with the exchange.
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:41:04
The simple answer is that these "hacks and exchanges" are not banks.  Don't leave your money there and they won't take it.
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:02:00
Some people are trading multiple times an hour.  Many are using computer programs to do their trading even faster than that.  They need a place where many people gather and are willing to trade together.

Think of your bitcoins like digital cash.  
You can keep them in a safe in your closet where you are the only one in the world with the password.  This is an offline wallet where you generated the key.
There are online wallets too.  Think of leaving your money with your cousin that always tags along with you.  It's convenient, but you really have no control over him and someone could always steal the wallet from him.
You can choose to leave your bitcoins with the guy in a fancy suit on the street corner.  He makes it easy to trade with other people, but he's not a bank.  There's a chance he'll disappear tomorrow and you'll have trouble getting your money back.  That is an exchange.

The real answer is nobody knows how exactly things will proceed.
Personally, I think they will have to file for bankrupty ala Mt. Gox.  Everything left will be liquidated and creditors will receive a portion of their holdings back.

Whenever using 2 years worth of data gives you the exact opposite conclusion?
@_date: 2018-10-16 03:04:07
I'm sure.  Maybe a better comparison is a bank or money lending place.  These people are dealing with all kinds of coins all day.  That's why I find it odd.  It may be totally normal procedure for them though.
@_date: 2018-10-16 04:17:29
You seem interested.  You should get some coins and send them around.  I have not done it in a while, but you could get some bitcoins on the testnetwork or grab some cheap altcoins so you do not have to invest much real cash.  Send the coins between addresses and on to various exchanges, etc.
@_date: 2018-10-16 04:24:46
There are tons of wallets so there is not just one answer.  In all the wallets I have used though, change was automatically sent to a new address.
@_date: 2018-10-16 02:57:50
No stupid questions.  I am certainly not the expert.


But you don't know if they own the sent amount or the change amount.  Well, in this case, you can probably deduce it, but it adds some obscurity.


I would think they have a number of smaller buckets of coin to dip into somewhere unless it was recently drained.  A millionaire probably has a sock drawer with a few $k in it somewhere so he does not have to dip into his savings account.  
@_date: 2018-10-16 02:54:08
He typed 0.83.  
You start with Account A with 30k BTC.  You send 0.83 to account B.  The rest of the coin in account A comes back as change in Account C.  Now, in theory, if someone knew you owned account A, they no longer know if you sent 0.83 BTC or 30k BTC.
@_date: 2018-10-16 04:11:35
Yes, it is generally all behind the scenes.  
Your wallet is a collection of keys to private addresses.  Old school wallets would generate about 50 random change addresses and change would be sent to those addresses one at a time.  This way when you backed up your wallet, you would still have access to your funds if you used your bitcoin after backing up.
Most wallets now are deterministic.  You input a 7 word phrase and it will continue to generate new addresses from that original phrase.    All you need is your phrase in order to have access to your original address plus all the ones generated after that.
@_date: 2016-11-19 02:47:08
They are also establishing that they are allowed to do this right now, when not much is on the line and nobody is paying attention.  That way in the future they can jump in and do it again with precedent.
@_date: 2018-10-16 02:39:54
You have 30k BTC in one address, and that's the secure way to get 0.83 BTC out of it.  The rest goes into a change address.
Unless you're asking why they are dipping into an account with 30k BTC.  That's probably the better question.
@_date: 2018-10-16 03:51:31
We need a real expert to weigh in.
I think change would go back to the original account back in the early days of bitcoin, but a potential vulnerability was found when a single address was sent from multiple times.  I think it was a very limited issue, but the theory is that you are still disclosing some bit of information when you sign the transaction with your key.  So, you may as well move it all to a new address for a bit more security.
@_date: 2016-12-03 04:42:56
Poor guy accidentally broke his duster on that fine gentleman's back.
@_date: 2018-10-16 04:13:10
But the change could have been sent back to the original address if wanted.  I feel that would be more simple in a beginner's eyes.  Instead we use a different system that is likely to catch people off-guard at first.
@_date: 2016-11-17 06:14:19
There was a Japan based exchange doing something similar just a few years ago.
@_date: 2016-12-03 04:46:26


All of these old bills have to be traded in.  It will be recorded (taxed probably?  not sure) when it's brought in.  
~~Also, last I saw, they were not in any real rush to release the new note.~~  Edit - I'm an idiot.  They already released the new 2000 rupee note.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:21:26
There was a similar difference on a site you may have heard of years ago - Mt. Gox.

I received my sticker about a week ago.  I set up changetip just for this.  Thanks again.

I agree with your sentiment, but surely people said the same thing many times in the past with bitcoin ($1, $10, $100)
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:59:56
I think you dropped the wrong signature into your blog.  You obviously accidentally copied one from an old block rather than the file you encoded.  Could you double check and confirm?  Thx.
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:55:28
You may have seen by now, but the posted key is worthless.
@_date: 2016-05-03 23:58:35


I agree with this.  


Gavin didn't make a big deal about this being the most convincing part though.  There was no, "Oh he totally remembered the secret password on that file I used!"
Someone could read most of my email to me from 6 years ago and I would not know if I had actually written it.  I'm sure Gavin generally remembers a bit of the content, but he was also all over the forum and talking a lot of people.  No doubt much of the info has kind of congealed together in his head.  Maybe they had an inside joke and never told anyone else though...
@_date: 2016-05-26 05:21:24
From your link:




This is completely standard now for all types of large companies.

Best I can tell he signed "the 1964 speech in which Jean-Paul Sartre explains his refusal to accept the Nobel prize for literature".  It doesn't say anything else in the article or the blog post.  
He could have added, "And hey, Craig=Satoshi" at the bottom and I would have been more convinced.  Seems entirely possible he found some type of pre-signed message.  It's still fishy he refuses to sign anything with the genesis block signature.  From what I remember that was at least partially hand calculated or encoded and there's no way he's lost that.
If I'm wrong, someone let me know.  
Edit:  Apparently he signed using the genesis block signature in a private setting - good enough convince two people who know what they are doing with bitcoin.  We'll see.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:43:17
Why drag it out like this?  Why walk the public through a fairly convoluted process without providing all the pieces needed.  It still doesn't make sense if you want to definitely prove you are Satoshi.  
The community simply needs hard evidence.  Some bitcoin expert here would be able to figure out if the signature was significant without handholding.  Seriously, look at this


When instead he could have provided the message he supposedly encoded.  The exact message is not provided anywhere.
@_date: 2016-05-02 07:53:32
I prefer to think someone or something is getting closer to the real Satoshi, so they have to blow this smokescreen up really big.  /tinfoilhat
@_date: 2016-05-08 07:51:31
This goes well with the post he stole from someone else and put on his blog about generating keys.
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:18:58
I won't believe it unless you have some kind of low quality video that you will only show to me in a private viewing.  
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:53:03
Why was his entire blog post a tutorial on using encryption tools rather than the actual proof anyway?  The whole thing is crazy.
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:47:23


Only part of it.  You can see that the entire speech was probably encoded as the signed message if you look closely at the pictures in the post.  Of course, the picture only shows part of the speech, not the entire thing....
@_date: 2016-05-30 04:41:23


Easy to make into a user as well.
OMG they found Satoshi SELL SELL SELL/BUY BUY BUY

Genuine question if someone wants to educate me:
I've always thought ETH was basically a premined coin that was shared with investors who burned bitcoin a while back.  I don't think I get it.  You can buy ETH but it's also used in smart contracts?
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:25:32
The only thing is Jon Matonis and Gavin Andresen both publically say they trust the proof they saw in private.  So it was not just goofy mainstream media journalists.
Not that Jon and Gavin make it 100% either though.
@_date: 2016-07-08 17:17:37
So to set up a smart contract I need a preset amount of ETH?  If there's a straightforward place to read about it please just send me there.  Everything I see is just lots of marketing talk without real numbers.

Thanks.  I am probably mixing them up a bit.
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:13:51
They did.  The link redirects to the coinbase website requesting the 2fa.  What happens is, in the background the original link requests an app to have permission to access your account at coinbase.  The user only see the coinbase website and webaddress and assumes all is well.
As soon as the user enters their 2fa, the app steals their coins.
