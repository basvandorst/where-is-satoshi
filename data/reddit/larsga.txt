That statement is meaningless. You can't use the word "tree" without there being some kind of context. If the context is computer science, the tree is a directed graph. If you want to claim that the meaning is different in some other context that's fine.

In computer science trees are very much directed. Just look at the [binary tree example](

Fake news is when you just make up shit that never happened (the Pope endorsed Trump, Pizzagate, etc). You may consider the MSM biased, but that's something else.

If you go back and look at those articles again you'll see that what the articles say is "Colin Powell claims Iraq has WMDs, citing intelligence sources". And that's true. Powell and the Bush administration were the liars. Reporting what the government says isn't fake news.
Of course, it has happened that the MSM has produced fake news. There have been rogue journalists who made up stories. When that's discovered, people are fired, their careers are forever ruined, and the newspaper publishes retractions etc, etc.

Man, that cartoon is a *cartoon*. It didn't really happen. The MSM doesn't spread fake news. Fake news is *fake*, it's *made up*, MSM doesn't do that.

Totally. Whereas to language X any idiot translate can. And nobody care will.

What's important about the Fed is what policies it pursues. There's plenty of issues there, but none of them are due to "secret backdoor dealings".

The Fed is audited. [Here's an audit report](

In practice, no. BIS wouldn't bail out American banks, or buy US gov't bonds if nobody else would bid on them. That role is filled by the Fed.
We've already seen this in practice in Europe: BIS didn't buy Greek bonds, or bail out Irish or Icelandic banks.

That's not an audit in the normal sense of the word.
In any case, why should they be required to disclose the details of conversations with international banks? It's not like the State Department discloses all its conversations with foreign entities.
@_date: 2016-02-19 15:25:46


No. That's the whole purpose of having a central bank setting the interest rate etc. Politicians don't trust themselves to do it, and they believe following a technocratic approach is the best way to do it. Therefore they make the bank head politically appointed, but afterwards independent.
It's the same in pretty much every developed country.

Pardon my ignorance, but what do you need a $2 million license for in NYC?

Currency symbols are outdated and pointless. What you really need is a bitcoin currency code in [ISO 4217](
(In any case, there are [many ways]( to write Bitcoin symbols already.)

If I were the receiver I would also require confirmation. Otherwise you're giving away some product based on nothing more than the customer promising that they've paid you. 
So IMHO this is misleading. In most cases the receiver will require confirmation, for very good reasons.

This is really baffling. Andresen's blog post is mostly about how he was totally convinced even without the actual proof. And it's very vague on what proof he was shown. That's really weird. The focus should have been on the proof, and that it's not makes it sound like he didn't get any proof.
@_date: 2016-07-24 18:28:30
Well, this guy will never be convicted, and there's no doubt he did it, so that doesn't really sound very convincing.
Edit: He's dead, so he can't be convicted.

Plus, he did it on the fifth anniversary of the Utøya attack.

He's dead. He *can't* be convicted.

It's also really, really compactly written, so I at least had to go back and forth a few times to really understand how everything worked. It is really neat, though, and an impressively clean and simple design.

The problem is that memes are by definition repeat jokes. Usually they weren't funny the first time. They attract people who like "funny pictures", and eventually drive out anyone interested in serious content.
 
Memes are like weeds. They'll take over the subreddit if you let them.

Bumbling idiots couldn't kill 6 million people. Human beings are pretty hard to kill. People like Adolf Eichmann and Rudolf Höss were highly competent administrators.

This is interesting, because this is not just any pub, it's actually one with a really good selection of beer.
Interesting that they accept fast payments. That means they take the chance that the customer will double-spend. However, in practice I guess that's fairly safe.

But it really is very like gold.
Gold is scarce because there's a limited amount of it on the planet, and it takes considerable resources to dig it up. Bitcoins are scarce because there's a limit on how many there will be, and they take considerable resources to mine.
Bitcoin as a currency also behaves exactly like a currency backed by the gold standard.
