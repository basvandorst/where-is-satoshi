well played sir
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:12:27
Anyone want to take a crack at it this? Seems pretty unlikely to me, but I'm not knowledgeable enough about either coin. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:19:46
Right, but you could argue that Altcoin and ICO proliferation was in itself a byproduct of bitcoin's worsening user experience. Just playing devil's advocate here.
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:14:59
Keep in mind, bitcoin fees are so high that any possible use case is prohibited...yet the price remains unaffected. Bitcoin has no "real world" economy so the people complaining about slow transactions and high fees are most likely just ferrying coins on and off exchanges. We would like BTC to be fast and cheap, but right now it doesn't have to be because most transactions are of no economic importance. Thats why the price is so stable...and why it might be stable for a lot longer. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:39:05
the best time would be now given that most BCH is inaccessible thus inflating the price. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:59:35
To be fair though, I don't think anyone is suggesting that BCH should be centralized. Proponents like Roger Ver believe that there is a balance to be struck between decentralization and scalability. Is there such thing as "decentralized enough", or is there no compromise? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:38:13
I agree with you and thats the dream...bringing bitcoin to the masses. We just have to wait and see if thats what core's scaling roadmap can accomplish. If it fails, then another coin will pick up the slack.

I understand that market cap is in some ways a misleading metric, but you are describing an extreme edge case that has no bearing on the crypto-ecomonomy. If you listed that coin, it's value would go to 0 instantly because while you have convinced your friend to pay 1$, you won't convince anyone else. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 06:41:01
Don't you think that most miners are secretly rooting for BCH despite the NYA? Segwit+LN would drastically reduce the number of on-chain transactions so its logical that the miners (especially big miners with huge hardware investments) are insentivized to prefer BCH in the long run. Switching their hash power is now an indirect attack vector against the main chain. 
Why would miners idly support BTC if their long-term prospects are better with BCH? 
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:05:28
I won't comment on how it might affect bitcoins acceptance, but I will say that a few months to relief is an optimistic but reasonable estimate. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:11:47
On chain transactions will always be expensive. If all transactions are segwit, it will roughly double the capacity of the chain, but realistically that might take a while. Lighting network is advertised as the solution to the fee problem. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:45:03
Everyone who owns BCH. Not noticeable right now because miners are hodling their BCH...they are betting on the longterm future of the coin. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:20:09
Thanks for the detailed response. Is there reason to be concerned if BCH becomes more profitable to mine? 
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:38:10
in all fairness though, with the projected difficulty reductions and BCH recovery, theres a good chance that it does become more profitable (at least in the short-term). Do you think that at the very least, the issue is flying under the radar? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:34:55
Easily proved by looking at their balances. Absurd amounts of BCH are just sitting in their wallets. Im not promoting BCH, I'm just telling you whats going on. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:39:13
I don't disagree with you, but I'd still like to know what the counter argument is to the theory that the drop in BTC market share coincides with blocks reaching capacity.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:01:40
They seem to believe that the drop in BTC market share coincides with blocks being full. Just curious, what's the counter argument? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:55:58
Miners created BCH and mined it at loss for over 3 weeks. They have created a competitor and want it to succeed. Is that such a ridiculous notion? 
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:34:58
Thanks for the link!
Is it technically possible to increase the discount factor through a soft-fork? 
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:08:34
Ok, so segwit transactions are not actually discounted by 75%...its just that 75% of the transaction data is witness data. Is that correct?
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:32:44
Ok, im not sure I'm following you but you seem knowledgable about this so I'm going to rephrase my question. 
Lets say down the road, core realizes that we need bigger blocks to sustain the network. How would they accomplish this? Would they hard-fork similar to S2X? Or would they soft-fork in way that increases the block weight limit (and is this even possible?). 
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:01:43
BCH is dropping faster than BTC. Our new Chinese overlords better start pumping soon...
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:32:39
I see your point, thanks for taking the time! Do you think that big miners are threatened by your vision of bitcoin? From what I understand certain mining companies have sunk 100's of millions in ASIC hardware and development with the intent of someday collecting fees on millions of transactions per day. Obviously such a thing is only possible on-chain. Im not saying we should cater to big miners, but given their financial incentives, it's not really surprising that they funded Bcash into existence. 
I think we can agree that a centralized on-chain bitcoin has short-term benefits for the end user. Realistically, the end user isn't going to care which coin is more decentralized until its too late and governments are rolling back the blockchain. Do you think that we can implement these second layer solutions fast enough to prevent an exodus to "the other chain"?
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:48:40
Is it possible to keep using soft-forks to increase our max transaction throughput, or would we eventually be forced to hard-fork S2X style? 
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:21:23
I was referring to the discount against the blocksize, not in the fee calculation. From what I understand, blocks now have a theoretical max size of 1.75mb because segwit transactions are weighted differently in the block. Im trying to understand if the weight discount is arbitrary (can be changed) or is there some underlying limiting factor. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 02:20:42
Is it accurate to say that core's scaling roadmap involves making bitcoin a settlement layer? Or is that big-blocker propaganda? 
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:26:09
I have a verified account with Kraken, just no funds on it. My funded account is with QuadrigaCX. Am I right to be concerned? Would it be wise to buy BTC on a small dip, transfer them to Kraken and sell ASAP and hopefully break even? 
edit: I'm going into BTC because I believe in the tech.
