this is an on-par response for calling someone's argument out - respond by attack the person, not the argument.

Fair enough - if that's the case, I misunderstood the point. I guess I assumed he was stating the opposite, which is effectively "society is always wrong no matter what". My bad.
That said, he might have gone a bit overboard on his response. I will also agree, however, that comment was fairly edgish.

Nope - there are a few possible reasons for this:
1) the client that sent the transaction did not actually send the transaction yet
2) The transaction had a lot of inputs and the fee was not large enough to compensate for that
3) blockchain.info hasn't updated its copy of the blockchain (probably unlikely)
4) blockchain.info hasn't told your browser about the transaction
In any case, you haven't lost it forever. Double check to make sure you sent it to the correct address. If you did, then you're perfectly fine. After 24 hours, if it did not send successfully, it will show back up in the source wallet. Otherwise, it will show up in the destination wallet soon enough.

The individual above is a propogandist who is harassing everyone who makes posts that do not completely agree with his ideologies. Given the sociopathic, repetitive and harassing behaviour he displays, he is on my RES follow list. I will be responding to everything he says. I apologize in advance to anyone who thinks anything he says has enough merit, but I don't believe in watching creepy strangers harass and bully people who have done nothing wrong, and using propaganda to entice people into thinking they are criminals.
Two can play at that game. I am not a sockpuppet account. I am not stalking you. If you make a propaganda post, I will respond to it with objective information on the techniques you use. I will do the same for anyone else. You are not special in any way, and it's preposterous that you think you are special at all to me. You're just another scumbag who uses deceptive, dishonest and disinformative techniques to con people into agreeing with your ideologies.
@_date: 2013-03-21 20:09:44
a "government" is a "government". Calling it by any other name in order to incite emotional response is a tactic of propaganda.
Selective reasoning (mentioning some things that governments (specifically dictatorships) do and not mentioning things that don't help your case and ideology) is also another tactic of propaganda.
Answer: Yes. You're turning into PKFO.
By the way, don't listen to me as I am a "stalker", and am "not well" and "have problems". knows everything and I know nothing, and he is totally not using propaganda in any way to incite emotional response rather than rational thought. He won't respond to me because he has no legitimate responses to me calling him out on his propaganda, and therefore he attacks me as a person instead, as a cop-out. You shouldn't listen to me, because he said so.
(Just watch, he'll write something about this)

I would appreciate it if you did not speak such libelous, decepting and false claims about me. I disagree with your viewpoints and hence I respond to them. I do not have a sick obsession. I am perfectly well.
You see, I respond to people who use incredibly propagandic tactics in order to deceive people. I also don't want to see turn into what might effectively turn into an for "anarcho-capitalists" (I say that because is for "feminism" (actually female supremacist propaganda) when real feminism is very reasonable and something very noble to strive for) and I have no problem with actual anarch-capitalists, but you take that a step too far and instead spew out propaganda in a very like manner.
I'm not stalking you - I respond in the same way to many people. Get a hold of yourself, and don't spew lies in order to discredit me.

Yeah, he didn't return your treatment to you. If he did, it would be pure propaganda, then asking for an apology, stating that he was polite and that you're just misunderstanding him, etc. when it's all actually just a load of bullshit. That would be returning your treatment.
Funny that in your mind, "leaving a country because you don't want to pay taxes" equals "whether I must exile myself before I complain that I'm being robbed" or "whether I am obligated to leave when people terrorize me for my money", twisting words to make them sound immensely worse than they really are. I don't care if they're true or false - you're better off calling them what they are rather than twisting words.
Also I find it funny that you consider agreeing with other people as not being "sensible" - if anything, it's more sensible than what you're trying to convey.

@_date: 2013-03-21 03:32:24
Yes. The longest chain will be the one that is used, and the other chain will be nullified - i.e. all of the transactions will be effectively reversed. This is why the 50% attack is a bad thing, because someone could generate a longer chain in secret, then expose it to the network and all of the transactions in the main chain get nullified.
@_date: 2013-03-21 03:44:45
block headers are small (less than 100 bytes if I recall correctly) and as long as those can be relayed reliably, everyone will still have access to the largest chain. If not, then the largest chain will be the one that has the most miners mining for it. I'd assume, in this case, that the blockchain that exists outside of the major US cities and the US will be the longest, and the transations from the other 49 blockchains will be nullified.
@_date: 2013-03-21 01:25:13
Okay, so let's break down this post for propaganda techniques, using  as reference.
First, I'm surprised he didn't use ad hominem in this. Reading his other posts, the large majority of them do. When combined with his other posts, ad nauseum becomes incredibly noticeable.
Appeal to fear occurs in this post when words like "victim" and statements like "ruin you" like "throw you in a dungeon" appeal to the fear of having these things done to you. It's also mentioned in a way that assumes such treatment is inevitable.
Let's also look at the black-and-white fallacy. Either you want to **kill** people, or you're being fully and 100% **extorted**. There is _no_ in-between, of course. None at all. (Sarcasm, of course). This is a popular method of propaganda because instead of someone's ideals being in the middle of two points, it makes the person think they can only be one or the other - in this case, one side demonizes them (an "accomplice), and the other side aligns with their ideology (evil government is "extorting" us (as if the person and propogandist are in a terrible situation together)) This tactic seems to be the one most used by and so I could go on with this one forever.
Let's look at cognitive dissonance. In this case, he is using this tactic to use war as a reason to abolish all state in general (and more specifically, taxes). While regular cognitive dissonance is typically using one party to cause like another party (or entity, item, object, thought, etc.), he is using one party to cause dislike of another party.
Labeling and name-calling is also used a lot by For example, the word "statist" is thrown around a lot, which in his case means "people who do not fully agree with him", as evidenced by his concurrent use of the black-and-white fallacy. You cannot partially agree, or you're with the bad guys. Also being called a "cow" in this post. Deception also plays a part in this.
"Obtain disapproval" is also used, as well as repetition, scapegoating, straw man, stereotyping, red herring, pensée unique, and more. I'm not going to bother going further into detail, however the wikipedia explains these tactics fairly well so you should be able to understand.
And this is just talking about the tactics themselves - it doesn't even mention how ridiculous the message itself is. That is all.
@_date: 2013-03-20 23:18:57
Fair enough. The main problem with threads like that is that they become large flame wars pretty quickly. I agree with KayRice that they should be discussed in their respective subreddits rather than here, if people cannot be friendly with one another (which unfortunately doesn't seem like so)

I didn't even know you a day ago, and I still don't really care who you are. I don't have anything personally against you, I just point out propaganda when I see it.
In any case, this, my friends, is what defeat looks like. Cannot respond to someone's well thought out argument? Your argument has been defeated, therefore you should block them quickly to ignore people who disagree with you. Then you can continue spreading propaganda without that nasty truth getting in your way.

This does not make my comment any less true. If it's false, please tell me why.

First, I bet that if someone asks exactly what propaganda techniques I used, he will not answer, or answer with a straw man. Please tell me, what propaganda am I using? All I've been doing is breaking down your propaganda.
Second, You're doing an incredibly good job "ignoring" me, considering you've read every single one of my posts and replied to them with context.
Third, I'm not the creepy stranger who bullies others. That would just so happen to be you. Which I also cover with detail and explanation in the post you replied to and "ignored".
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:25:17
Which is funny because you respond a lot.
Also everything I say is objective, and easily verifiable by others. I also don't call people I disagree with names, like "statists".
Of course none of that matters, because propagandists do this in order to deflect dissent. It's happened throughout history many times, and this is another example of it now.
@ Patrick5555: There's nothing wrong with the word statist when used respectfully. The problem is he uses it in a way that dehumanizes people who disagree with him.
Also, a "statist" is not automatically a violent person.
@_date: 2013-03-21 04:38:38
He uses fairly confusing tactics and makes it deliberately hard to have a casual conversation with. They are not "opinions", and he's not looking for discussion or debate - he's doing this because he's trying to sell you (on) something.
@_date: 2013-03-20 23:01:26
I never said I wanted to stop all related discussion. I also never called anyone names, so I don't see what you mean with that last sentence.
Discussion on political ideologies is nice when it's done properly (what's good/bad about one ideology or the other, what happens when such thing happens, etc.) however it's become inflammatory (my ideology is better than yours and if you disagree you can go fuck yourself, and the like) and that's what I hate seeing, because then it becomes no better than that of two religious fundamentalists fighting with each other (I mean no offense to anyone who is religious but doesn't partake in these sort of fights)
Sure, on a very low level bitcoin may be somewhat related to these. However, this isn't discussion. This is two parties throwing shit at each other, and it really doesn't belong in bitcoin unless people can be civil and actually discuss the merits and demerits of said things. This is not happening, and if you think it is, you are full of shit.
@_date: 2013-03-21 15:42:59
Yes, unless the bitcoin inflation rules changed when I wasn't looking.
@_date: 2013-03-20 20:50:07
The original comment above me was:
"It's funny how you say that I use "propaganda words" when I use plain English words to describe what you describe with propaganda words.
Is a jail not a cage? Yes it is. Why do they call it a "jail" then? Because the people who run the cages and use the cages to ruin human beings, don't want the reality that they are caging people to be evident. They want everyone to think that "cages" are for kidnap victims, while "jails" are for "bad people", so you will have less sympathy for the people they forced into cages. That makes "jails" a propaganda term for cages.
I see where you're going with what you said. You're trying to discredit what I said for speaking English instead of speaking propagandese. Not going to happen."
Here's my response:
The term "cage" is much more degrading than "jail", which you use to get an emotional rather than rational response. This is the very definition of propaganda. Don't kid yourself.
You also use many other propaganda techniques, such as selective facts, only presenting one side of an argument, Ad Hominem (and holy shit you've used this a lot), appeal to fear, ad nauseum, biased appeal to prejudice, black-and-white fallacy, demonizing the enemy, dictat, half-truth, FUD, glittering generalities, labelling, and... well, you honestly use pretty much every single propaganda trick in the book.
The greatest part of your response is you then use propaganda against me in an attempt to make **me** believe I'm using propaganda words. That's a classic, well done.
You also use name-calling in this last comment, calling me a "sockpuppet account" and "stalker". The point of calling me this is not to attack my argument, it's to attack me personally, which is another propaganda method. My argument is sound. If you don't believe so, respond to it, not me.
@_date: 2013-03-23 19:03:35
The point is that "the earth is flat" is completely irrelevant to the "point" of "the government is bad".
Where your gf walks is not public record. If you truly believe it is, you are kidding yourself and overreact easily.
I have no problem with throwaway-o's stance on these things, however I do have a problem when he uses propaganda tactics to gain an emotional response rather than a rational one.
For example, an example of a rational, reasonable argument would be [here]( [here]( and [here]( These are all reasonable discussions, nobody's calling anyone else names, and people think rationally about problems and solutions.
What happens with throwaway-o (in many cases - there are some times where he is rational, but I haven't found many times where he's been reasonable unfortunately) is that he uses numerous methods to make things look as badly as possible (yes, things are bad, but there are times when attacking statements honestly take it too far), inciting emotional response rather than rational, and ends up making the whole situation even worse. If we want people to really embrace the idea of Anarcho Capitalism, we can't be attacking them and telling them "you are a bad person, even though you do your best to be a good person." It doesn't matter if it's true or false, the problem is that incites an emotional reaction where people will, instead of responding with "you're right", respond with "how dare you say that, evil attacker!"
Here's the thing - honestly, I am an Anarcho Capitalist. I've posted numerous times in and throwaway-o and others (you included, actually) have responded positively with many posts on my real account. In fact, while I don't have as much comment karma as he does, my account is actually older than his and I've been around here for longer than he has. However these people do more harm than good to the movement.
I want anarcho capitalism to succeed, I really do, but having throwaway-o and others constantly attacking people in various subreddits because they don't immediately accept the ideals behind our principals is harmful to us. It makes people shrug us off and consider us "crazy" or "deluded". When a real anarcho-capitalist society exists and thrives, the people who eventually collapse it will not be statists or others trying to instill a repressive government - it will be people like him who will make people want to stay away from us "crazies".
What's even worse are subreddits like It makes us look like the kind of people you find in and (especially on reddit) these people are very frowned upon, even by many women, and also people you find in (which, while I am athiest, in many cases I don't even want to be associated with these people).
In conclusion, in most cases has a sound message, but he is way too aggressive with his viewpoints and (demonstrably) is pushing people further away from the movement. The only people he's really preaching to are people who are already AnCaps (and not even all of them, as shown by the existence of this account at all). I have no problem with his message (and honestly I completely agree with it), but I have a problem with his aggressive, propagandic-esque and emotional delivery.
Also PS, many of my latest posts (not including this one - I actually put on my serious face for this post) have been trolls, because I was just tired of taking shit from people and decided I shouldn't waste time articulating my thoughts for them. Sorry if you were a victim of this, I just was in a different mindset.

I believe that businesses becoming bitcoin-friendly (and businesses that solely accept bitcoin) are growing faster than ever, and that's a really good thing. The problem is that people still appear to have trouble easily getting bitcoin from fiat, and unfortunately it's unrealistic to say that everyone who wants bitcoins should run their own business.
In that case, I feel like the two parts that will make bitcoin successful (ease of acquisition and ease of purchases/use) are independent bottlenecks, and currently the business bottleneck is larger than that of the ease of acquisition bottleneck.
That being said, both are growing and the price definitely shows that.
@_date: 2013-03-21 00:06:23
"Regulate" covers a large scope, so I don't know exactly what you're asking, but I'll assume you mean "when a government orders you to pay up".
Consider this:
If a court demands $12 from you, they could tell banks to take that money from your account (if you have it) or close accounts until you've paid. They could search your house and/or car for cash, or take your house and/or car, evict you, put you in jail for x amount of time. You probably have that $12 somewhere, and if you don't pay the fine then you'll probably end up losing a lot of other things.
Now in this situation, if you do everything in bitcoin - purchases, store of value, etc. - you're still in the same position. Even if your bitcoins are stored in a brain wallet known by some other person, if you don't pay the court, then you'll end up losing the same things than if you did everything with USD, or plain cash.
Now, if you mean "regulate" as in taxing (a popular discussion as of late), then you're probably okay in assuming the same rules as if Bitcoin was a foreign currency, or barter. This means you're still technically required to pay taxes on income or same-country (or same-state) sales, as well as property tax and whatnot. Creating a new currency does not necessarily mean the laws already put into place do not regulate them. In essence, Bitcoin is already technically regulated.
Now, this all assumes you want to stay legit and legal. If you don't care about staying in the law, that's a different story. If you don't want to pay taxes, it'll be easier with bitcoin - however, it's also just as easy to evade taxes with cash (assuming no bank accounts). However, if you get caught (assuming you live in the US), the courts will not go after your bitcoins directly - instead, they will go after your livelihood. At that point, the only way to really evade taxes, even with the risk of getting caught, is to store everything in bitcoins (or cash offshore or with a friend), not have a car or a house or any property whatsoever that can be taken from you, as well as living with the idea that you may potentially be thrown in jail for what you are doing.
I may be wrong with some things I've written, or even all - I'm happy to discuss that and will be reasonable. Since this subject matter appears to evolve into flame wars, this is all assuming US law. If things work differently in a different country (that exists) then I'm happy to discuss that - I won't talk about governmental systems that don't exist though, since I don't want flame wars starting.

Make sure you sent it to the bitcoin address you meant to, and hope for the best. If there's a transaction ID and it's in a confirmed block, that means the bitcoins have definitely been sent and relayed by the network. A rescan is probably your best best right now - if you still don't see the bitcoins, it's probably a bug in the client that you're using.
Try importing your private keys into a different client and then they should hopefully show up.

You're calling people out because they said you were "evil", depite the things you have said regarding others who don't follow your beliefs? That's funny.
In my opinion, there's nothing wrong with being an anarcho-capitalist. I'm glad there are people who think differently from many of the people here.
However, nobody's going to take you seriously when you use propaganda words to try to convey your beliefs. If you stop calling jails "cages", announcements "threats", and people who don't subscribe to the anarcho-capitalist belief "statists", you'll probably have much more success here.

But Bitcoins (at least in the future, when all have been mined) will have even less inflation than gold does, since mining causes gold to always have a little bit of inflation.
I can't make new posts quickly because of my low score due to a small group of people, but as a response to NeuxSaed:
That is a valid point - in the same time span, it is definitely possible that the level of inflation of bitcoin more or less coincides (maybe not to the same level, however) with gold as the mineral becomes harder to find.

I agree. Basically this OP appears to boil down to "not everyone agrees with anarcho-capitalism, therefore we are no longer a community. You are no longer my friend anymore, stop sending me cards"
It's not the people who pay taxes or the people who don't pay taxes that break the community apart. It's the people like Rudd-O who use propaganda to push his ideals rather than letting a community just be a community.

I wish for no harm done against you, truly, however all you bring to this subreddit are flame wars and lately you've brought effectively zero discussion. You've also been trying to deliberately break the bitcoin community apart in an attempt for people to agree with your ideologies (re-iterating, I have no problem with your ideologies, I have a problem with they way you're pushing them on people).

I know better than to talk *to* a propaganda-spewing system, as those things can never be convinced. The posts I make are for the benefit of others. They are also free to not care, but multiple viewpoints, truth and dissection of information are what defeats propaganda.
Also, you have responded to just about every post I've made, even ones where I'm not responding to you, or even mentioning you. Please kindly fuck off, and if you want to discuss, discuss. (Though obviously you don't, as you attempt to use propaganda to convince people they are wrong in everything they do)
So in conclusion, please kindly fuck off with your libel and your propaganda. Thanks :)
PS. I also like how you think **boldness** makes your lies more **truthy**

I cannot stand people like this. They complain that the entire world around them is wrong, when it turns out it's only them that's wrong.
Especially the people who are vocal, they are the worst.
Brace yourself, because is so **angry** right now

throwaway-o also blocked me on RES, how risqué! (I don't care who he is, but it's laughable that he thinks he's special and that he thinks I've singled him out for him and not his arguments)

I'm really not sure if I should downvote you because of what you ask in the title, or upvote you for your constructive and valid reasoning in the description.
I feel lately like everything on has stopped being about bitcoin, but rather about either being about government or no government. Some people have even used propaganda and division tactics in order to get their point across (I'm looking at you, throwaway-o).
I see this on both sides of the equation, where non-government-wanters (ancaps?) will argue and fight anyone who doesn't agree with them, and and people who prefer government will argue and fight anyone who doesn't agree with them. Honestly, I think this whole thing is stupid. (Though if you are in one of these parties and just want friendly discussion, I don't mean you)
I'd understand if we were talking about bitcoin in relation to how it would work under one system versus another system, but now it just seems like people are fighting for their ideologies.

Not always. While not as bad as coinbase, if they arbitrarily assume you're high risk, they will actually let you deposit money but not withdraw it.
Also, as mentioned, wire transfers are fucking expensive.

I agree.
I just think it could do without the flamewars, which seem to happen inevitably any time governmental systems are discussed. It's unfortunate that a few people ruin it for the rest of us

I would appreciate it if you did not speak of such libelous, decepting and false claims about me. I disagree with your viewpoints and hence I respond to them. I do not have a sick obsession. I am perfectly well.
You see, I respond to people who use incredibly propagandic tactics in order to deceive people. I also don't want to see turn into what might effectively turn into an for "anarcho-capitalists" (I say that because is for "feminism" (actually female supremacist propaganda) when real feminism is very reasonable and something very noble to strive for) and I have no problem with actual anarch-capitalists, but you take that a step too far and instead spew out propaganda in a very like manner.
I'm not stalking you - I respond in the same way to many people. Get a hold of yourself, get a life, and don't spew lies in order to discredit me.

You have a private and public key that are mathematically related to each other. You can safely give the public key out to anyone, and you make sure nobody else can get your private key.
With public key crypto, you can sign messages by using the private key to encrypt. This means you know for a fact that the message is as valid as the public key, which is used to verify.
You can also encrypt messages with a public key, that can only be decrypted with a private key.
This is simple, however you should really google for this. It is something that has been answered numerous times, most likely even here in /r/Bitcoin
