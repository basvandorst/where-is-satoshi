This is different from the website of the crypto currency broker litebit.eu which is very legit and where I do most of my trading. Was scared at first reading the post but I see there are two "i"s in your domain name. Thanks for the warning though and keeping others from doing the same.

So you're telling me I have to wait about a 150 years? That's comforting ;-)

I'm no expert but a little Google wizardry turned up the following page which after reading through it might hold a possibility for recovering your BTC:

I wouldn’t dare to call myself more experienced than you, I definitely believe in the long term potential of BTC yet my gut feeling and some TA tells me I can get a better entry point than the current levels. When the price could hit 3k-4k as a bottom my money buys me about 2x more BTC then getting in now. I know about the wise man, yet I d rather be a fool trying for my bottom than wiser buying in now. Time will tell the truth, let s see how the coming months play out. Wish you the best with your investment strategy.

I know the feeling, best to stay disciplined though, because you don't know how low it might go in the coming weeks/ months you spread out your entry point instead of guessing this is the best time to invest.

So we wait a bit and buy in around $2.750 - $3.000 ish?
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:07:17
Amen to that brother.
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:03:36
I'm quite sure we're going to hit 5k, just not about the timing, think we'll have another dead cat bounce thingy around 6k.

Tell that to the crowd that fully Tether up for days (weeks?) during dips and/ or downtrends ;-)

I've sold everything in January actually in anticipation of the upcoming bubble deflation/ crash. Didn't get back in at the first bottom Feb 6th but will do so at the following opportunity when, I think, we most likely hit $4.000 - $5.000 levels. Will gradually start buying in around $5.000 downward.

Maybe he's going to toast it between a couple of overclocked NVIDIA's. Or do we figure him to be a rare instead of medium cooked type of guy? Either way, no need to add salt ;-)

Don't think it's dying, stick around and look what happens when BTC hits $5.000 or lower, I'll be yelling: IT'S ALIVE! And buying of course ;-)

Nice overview, so what would be the global average cost considering the percentage BTC currently mined in each country? That would give us a good indication of what the lowest can be that BTC could go down in price without collapsing the entire system since miners would unplug their rigs.
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:25:33
I've read up on quite some of the articles related to this topic so yes, I'm aware of the cost and that it differs per country/ region because of electricity costs and other factors. I also don't think that the people who are buying/ selling Bitcoin and "assigning" it value are basing the price they are willing to pay on the mining costs. We'll see how it turns out, don't know how to use the Reddit "Remind me in" thingy yet but this would be the first time I'd want to use it. Might read up on it later today ;-)

I sit behind a screen working all day as a developer so in the corner of the screen I have a ticker pinned all day that I glance at every now and then ;-)
@_date: 2018-03-10 23:38:21
Nope, I m still not buying, flash all you want, there s big discounts on the horizon ;-)
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:34:21
Not yelling, rather agreeing even though many people would rather stay ignorant and not even consider this option. I think we are returning to the trendline before the exponential growth started last year and then have stable growth again after a period of sidetrending. In the end nobody knows what's going to happen the next couple of months/ years, just my thoughts.

Let's see if this becomes a reality, I'm actually hoping it does, easiest way to go back to FIAT and the other way around. Wonder what ALT-coins they are going to support though.
@_date: 2018-03-15 22:34:42
Hahaha, I think so too, my goal is to accumulate exactly 1 Bitcoin sometime this year so I have my piece of the proverbial land-pie and HODL that thing like it's my digital baby for the years to come safely tucked away in a hard-wallet.
@_date: 2018-03-11 08:06:38
Spot on, still going down, then consolidate, then slowly back up.
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:09:49
Always amazed when people start downvoting a post when you say that you think BTC is going down to any level below their expectations like 4k-5k as if then it's not going to happen.
