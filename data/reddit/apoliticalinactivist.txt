Yup, it's still in development, so there are not enough corporate advertisers to support paying BTC to the user.    
The long term goal is to change how advertising revenue is broken down.  Currently, most of it goes to the marketer and some to the site, but the future would go mostly to the user and the site.  This is similar to how the BTC faucets work, where you get coins for clicking on ads or doing surveys.  Also similar to BTC, this only works if enough users adopt usage.  
Two major factors besides the eventual BTC payback though.  [1] It's a good browser, very fast and the default options are like a simplified Ghostery (so easy to recommend to normal users) and [2] The optional $5/mo supports your favorite sites and pushes BTC adoption (webmasters can't get the money without getting a wallet).

Lol, exactly this.  
The upcoming fork is and always has been, a game of chicken.  It will show if the claimed core consensus is true or is the result of a moderated echochamer.  
If/when miners point to SW2x chain and say "that is now bitcoin"; whether that is core excluding rogue miners or core being cut out of the chain, all depends on the how many and how long the miners go.

It sounds like you're trying to use Bitcoin like cash?  As you probably gathered from other responses, you can either have speed or cheap with the current state of BTC.  
For speed AND cheap, you'd have to look elsewhere, maybe trying googling "use bitcoin as cash"?  Good luck!

You're not wrong and I honestly have nothing against L2, as I think it's inevitable, but to me, it's putting the cart before the horse.  
It's like pushing to build a traffic system for flying cars to alleviate traffic instead of improving our existing roads.  You're making the assumption that flying cars will be the future solution to a problem that might not even exist anymore (self driving cars, tube transport, etc).

iirc, they print out the wallet on the receipt/email and you can sweep it into your preferred wallet.  
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:00:43
You pretty much have to find an exchange to allow trading between the two versions.  Most exchanges have no position yet or are going to freeze trading for a day until the dust settles.  
By controlling your own key, you'd have to wait for your wallet to allow for the split, but you'd likely miss the prime trading time.  
Safest thing to do is to do nothing and not try to game it.

To avoid taxes, send to your own outside wallet, shapeshift to different crypto (ETH or LTC), then send back to coinbase.  This way you have plausible deniability that you profited off you coins.

Not quite, if the valet steals your car, that is theft as defined by law.

All exchanges are NOT created equal.  You use shady ones based in a country with no finance laws and they pull an exit scam?  your fault.  
It's not victim blaming when it comes to crypto.  The sector is VERY loosely regulated, so the theft is still *immoral*, but hardly *illegal*.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:39:33
I disagree with your premise.  
Why does BCH need innovation?  It should be as basic and simple as possible, as the primary use is p2p digital cash.  Like regular cash, move value from point A to point B.  I **want** my cash to be boring.  
All the fancy layer two solutions and smart contracts are cherries on top, that should be incorporated if/when needed and thoroughly tested on other chains/coins first.  
@_date: 2018-03-01 02:22:47

What do you think a currency is?  
Are you able to exchange it for goods and services? yes? Then it's a currency, period.  The practicality of use or recognition by governments has nothing to do with it.  
That is the beauty of BTC, it's a pure currency not tied to (in)stability of a nation or relative shininess of a mineral.  
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:42:53
Lol? 
Your defense for tether is that the currency they are pegged to, is also printed out of thin air?  ooookay
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:50:00
Disagree.  
Regulation exists to boost normal currency's illusion of stability.    Fiat is backed by government faith and power.  Bitcoin is backed by worldwide demand.  Which is greater?  
Bitcoin has the potential to be a true global commodity/currency that is ultra resilient.  China bans exchanges and the price dips by 20% for a week.   Compare that to the Trump making a stupid tweet, pushing the market down a few percent?   Which feels more stable?  
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:02:15
Not a farm, but just usage.  
Think of how stable western currency is, how the value of a dollar will get you a coke tomorrow, same as today.  
Now compare to some unstable nations, where the 20% fluctuation in bitcoin is more stable than their local currency.  
Venuzuela, oil based economy is falling apart now that oil prices are going down.  Various warlord controlled areas where the value of the paper in your hand is based on the health of that warlord.  Hell, look at the various burst bubbles in Greece, Spain, US, etc. all within the past decade.  
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:25:05


lol.  It's pretty funny that you accuse me of lacking imagination, as you lay out traditional economics while disregarding new techs and related ideas.  Because it's software, any huge problem that comes up can be patched and the ledger rolled back, eliminating the fork where the value dropped to zero.  


1] We don't need force of law, as the blockchain is a trust, but verify system open to all.  
2]  Requirement of acceptance is a feature for governments and fiat, but unnecessary for bitcoin, as it's all voluntary usage.  You don't want to accept it? then don't.  
3] Taxes? Also only needed for government fiat.  bitcioin is beyond any single government.  
4] Stabilty.  Long term stability is different from short term price fluctuations.  Plus, look at any developing country with a more traditional currency; they aren't immune to price fluctuations.  
5] Incentive to spend?  Look at any unstable/warring government with wildly fluctuating fiat.  Using bitcoin is more stable.
6]  Central banks are there because in the past, a real time adjustments for the valuation of cash was not possible, as well as trust limitations between nations.  
7]  Distributed fairly to all citizens?  Again, a problem only for fiat.  In the long run, even if the the huge whale(s) dumps all his bitcoins and crashes the price, the affect is negligible in the long run.  
All these things you bring up as problems are features, lol.  I really hope you learn more about blockchain, as it's pretty reassuring once you understand.  
Lastly, I'm not the person you are thinking of regarding the Deutch Mark history, so I guess you're the dumbass?   lol.  Have a good one.

This is where you are conflating "community consensus" with personal opinion.  
There is no metric for community consensus, which the whole reason why there are these info fights when dev teams and miners disagree on a change.

@_date: 2017-09-27 22:48:08
The difference between a gamble and a steady return is your timeframe.  
You go to vegas for a week, that's gambling.  From the casino's perspective, it's a viable business plan.  
People who are holding dont care about what is happening in china right now, they are looking at what can affect the value ten years from now.  If 90% of the major players go down tomorrow, holders will instantly boot up all their old CPUs and GPUs and start mining like crazy, lol.  That type of failure will have almost no effect on the value in ten years.  
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:55:04
Exactly.  
Fundamentally, bitcoin has set it's niche and why would anyone conglomerate try to invade that niche as opposed to steering development?  There is never going to be a bitcoin 2.0, as all tech will inevitably rolled into a version bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-09-29 00:05:02
The primary difference of software is that it is constantly developed and updated.  The reason no one uses older OS, is that people stopped working on it or supporting it.  
A version of bitcoin will always have value, as bitcoin is true opensource and will always be developed.  Even if one branch loses all value, as long as you own your wallet, a version will remain secure and retain value.  
When you say "actual" currency, take a second to consider what is currency and what gives it value.  
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:53:54


Comparing the level of usage and the size of the blocks (with segwit activated), there is still plenty of room to scale up and keep transactions times down.  


Right now to run a full node, it would take roughly 150gb.  compare that to the largest consumer-level flashdrives of 256gb and cutting edge drives of 2tb already exist.  Also, it's not all or nothing with a full node, lots of tweaking can be done to make almost full node that is fraction of the size.  


That depends on the believers and how they push development.  If you want to keep fees low, push back against the corporate miners by running your own full node of the bitcoin version that you most agree with, mine in a pool that shares your values.  


The adoption rate has nothing to do with the tech, but the lack of understanding and other barriers to entry on the part of the consumer.  Day to day purchases can be done with no problem in a similar way as secured credit cards.  Imo, it's the variation of price that is limiting adoption, since the price can swing 10-20% in a matter of minutes, it's tough to build a business plan around.  
@_date: 2017-09-30 01:32:32
Based on stats, the peak this past day is roughly 10,000 PH/s, so if we lose 90%, we need 9,000PH/s  =&gt; 9,000,000 TH/s =&gt; 9,000,000,000 GH/s.  
Then assuming the average vid card getting around 0.5Gh/s, we would need a mere 18 million GPUs.  Considering how many of us also have old miners laying around, I think that is pretty doable.  
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:41:38
Wonderful counterpoint!  
You don't seem like a idiot, just an asshole; so, I honestly hope you come back with a strong counterargument after getting a solid grasp of how blockchain works and adjusting the scale of your thinking to a global level.  
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:57:18
It's the same as all the other forks, just that we happen to be in the minority and will be losing the bitcoin brand.  It'll just take slightly longer to recover, but I plan to mine like crazy while the difficulty is low on ~~btc1~~ core coins (edited: didn't know  project was called btc1)!  
I'm actually looking forward to it, It'll be like going back to the old days!  Buy during the dip and HODL!
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:37:58
People tend to ignore the context and provide blanket statements, OP and his naysayers included.  
"Gambling" in a casino is safe, as it is a known risk, you will lose at least 51% of the time, short/medium/long term.  
Bitcoin is almost zero risk long term, as forking ensures some chain will maintain value.  Short and medium term?  HIGH risk, due to the current volatility.  
Traditional investing is a combination of both, risk is unknown, but is mitigated by various performance metrics as well as being propped up by the world's economy.  But that won't stop the proverbial meteor strike from wiping out your individual investment.  
The level of risk is dependent on your personal risk profile and return threshold.  OP's advice lacking in information and was rightly downvoted.  Those replying to him were uninformed regarding bitcoin.  The real loser here was the college student not getting proper advice.

Last time I looked, it was 1 in a 100 years?  
Most CPU and GPU miners use nicehash, so they'll all switch over automatically if/when BTC crashes in price. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 00:21:14
A strength of blockchain is that it is self regulating.  
Each user can all switch over to whatever code they want.  So, if segwit2x goes into effect, they might be able to take over the brandname of "bitcoin" (thee biggest loss, imo), but there are enough people out there running core and segwit1x that it wont die.  
Short term, miners might make a ton of money and/or value of bitcoin plummets, but it really doesn't affect hodlers very much.  
Stick with a neutral exchange that will give you both coins in case of fork or better yet, pull your coins to your own wallet to make sure you benefit from both.  
If you have the money, run a full node of the the type of coin you believe in.  
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:21:09
Close to instant, based on the location of the nodes?  I'm really not seeing the benefit over a direct transaction?  
Yep, different definitions of anonymous.  It's like how ISPs can only tell which sites you visit, but not individual pages; this is not anonymous to me.  Ad companies can built entire profiles that are scary accurate with this info alone (see facebook).  
@_date: 2017-09-30 01:12:49
I disagree that the bitcoin experiment "fails" if 2x succeeds, we merely lose the brandname as the minority of the fork.  All of us believers in the potential will just carry on.  
The recovery will be slower than usual, but like any other dip, just buy more, lol.  btc1 will reach a equilibrium on difficulty and eventually will outcompete b2x in cost.  The problems with regulation won't go away and people will move over as they get more knowledgeable.  
This is just a short-medium term cash grab.  Hodlers just keep on drinking your coffee.

They cops would have to link you to wallet 1, exchange 1, and somehow crack monero as well.  Unless you access them all on a single computer that they are monitoring and then transfer the exact same amount, you can just deny everything.  
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:24:24
Not really.  
bitcoin is decentralized as anyone can propose anything and every user/node can choose to implement or not.  
There is always going to only be only one primary dev team as consensus breeds consensus.   It's not that there aren't other dev teams working on the protocol, it's that the community has decided the primary team is still doing the best job.  
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:06:56


It does for the latter, like I keep saying.  It's software, improvements get incorporated.   You seem to be assuming that bitcoin will never change?  What is your worst case scenario of bitcoin being replaced by a superior tech?   What type of tech do you see that will replace bitcoin and yet be unable to be incorporated into it?  
Plus, I don't care if bitcoin "wins" or not, all I know is that it'll still be around.  I personally predict it'll exist in the shadow of a mainstream corporate coin, as most people don't care about the tech or being free from banks/govt and will use it like visa+paypal.   It'll be like Apple/Android, simple folks paying a premium for branding and simplicity of use and a whole mess of options for people to be idealistic or get fancy.  
Venuzuela is simply an example of the potential, as most people don't even realize it's an option nor do they understand it.  Regardless of how their fiat got the way it is, the point is that in the cases of unstable fiat, bitcoin becomes a viable alternative.  
Also, I said nuclear strike on the US; the only nuclear capable ally of N. Korea is China and they stated that if N.Korea strikes first, they will not support them.  It was intended to show another potential example of an isolated unstable economy.  
I was never implying to invest your life savings into bitcoin and specifically mentioned long term in my original comment regarding it.  You've been projecting your definition of "safe" this whole time to my very limited statement and even after me specifically defining what I meant by "safe".    
Yes, I agree with your current assessment.  The risk profile of bitcoin is around the level of an index fund of a second world nation.  It'll still be around in 30years in some form, with a significant return, but will have zero guarantees for any value at any specific point in time.

@_date: 2017-10-24 01:12:50
Kinda.  blockchain is software.  If we're all running rev01, but disagree on what to include as rev02, then we fork off and there will be two "rev02" competing.  Because you had coin during rev01, you get the equivalent amount on **both** rev02 chains.  
Then you have to worry about "reply protection", which mean that the two rev02 share so much in common, that by spending you coin for one, you send both.  
The safest thing to do is pull out your coins to a wallet you control.      you can look up a guide on how to claim your forked coins then.  
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:00:41
Lol, segwit is the original reason for BCH forking off.  
SW2X just increases the block size.  No reply protection, as it's an aggressive dispute between the miners and core.

You're looking at it from a western pov.  Plenty of unstable economies out there, like single commodity nations (Kuwait, Venuzuela, etc); warring states (Syria); all other examples i keep repeating and you keep ignoring....because....?

@_date: 2017-10-12 22:19:45
There's plenty of cryptos that are already "better" than bitcoin in some way, but the beauty of software is that those improvements can be incorporated into the code.  
Bitcoin as we know it may or may not survive, but some version (fork) of it will.  The reason I think it is safe, is that control lies with me (and my keys), so even if any government manages to shut it down, as long as there are a handful of nodes, we can roll back the ledger to a pre-attack date, preserving my coins (and value will slowly recover).  
I guess we have different ideas of "safe"?
@_date: 2017-10-04 20:51:12
This feels like a compilation of references for people who are already following along closely.    
As someone who read most of it and has a general idea of who the players are, what is lacking is not a summary, but a frame of reference or context for the info, especially if you want to inform complete beginners.  
Focus on one or two themes (the underlying goal for the splits are to get the bitcoin brand) for the article and split off others for a follow up.  Cut the weak pedantic stuff like the final paragraphs comparing weak analogies from two different people that are not proven to be colluding, let alone coordinating messaging.  Right now, it just sounds disjointed.  
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:33:18
"can't be"?  why not?  
Right now most of the extra decimals are rounded and left on exchanges as dust, but you can buy and sell at that level if you want.  Just look on Kraken, the cumulative order displayed goes out to 12 digits or something.  
If BTC becomes that valuable, wallet displays will simply adjust accordingly.  
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:15:37
Sure, but those qualifiers are pretty subjective after you take the governments out of the picture.  The only reason we even differentiate between commodity and currency is that commodities have time-values or are difficult to transport.  Bitcoin has neither of those drawbacks, so the traditional separation of terms is meaningless.  
Using your example, it's like me being able to put that car in my pocket and able to go to any community and trade it for local currency or other goods/services.  
The fact that there is no reason to differentiate between currency and commodity is not meaningless, it's the entire reason bitcoin is amazing!  
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:38:07
I see as a framework that incorporates everything and is shaped by the future.  Like the interstate shaped vehicle design and in turn shaped foreign policy.  Like the internet is reshaping human interaction.  I see blockchain similarly as something that can be improved upon, but not replaced.  
Thank you as well!  Civil discourse is so rare now!  
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:31:36
Check out nicehash.  It can get you started in minutes on your PC/laptop to get you an idea of what it takes to mine.  
When you think about profitability and costs to mine, what is your timeframe?   Since price is so volatile, most people talk about payback period before profitability, so are thinking in months.  If you're a long term hodler, then any USB stick miner is great, since it's going to have a 10000% return!   lol.  
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:33:06
Those Yapanese coins are good example of that. 
Putting aside the origins of BCash, Gresham's law wouldn't really apply here, as all bitcoin are equal and one of the core principles is ease of use.  It's all decimal places, so as the value goes up, we just keep inventing arbitrary subdivisions, like what we saw happen with the "satoshi" unit.  
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:44:12
Exactly.  
The tech and what it represents is the amazing part.  It represents bypassing of a huge institutional barrier.  If money talks, then bitcoin is rev00 of a universal translator.

Pretty sure all the arguments is a feature of things being open source and having information available, which is one of the core principles behind blockchain.  
I don't have to trust you, I just verify that the data you put up.  If we can't resolve our differences, we go our separate ways.

@_date: 2017-10-13 18:53:00
The comparison with Aol is not apt, as they have private management and development.  Open source means bitcoin devs can take the best bits from other coins and incorporate it.  It's already being done with Litecoin being a test bed for bitcoin.  
I'm starting to see their differences in our views, aside from the tech understanding.  You're in bitcoin purely as an investment vehicle and still primarily fiat focused, western fiat at that.
Bitcoin is not for western investors (even though we're essentially providing VC funds for it), it's like a global backup currency, especially important for the part of the world without stable fiat.  
In the case of a nuclear attack (and we survive), bitcoin would be even more useful, as it would be more stable than the post nuclear paper fiat and easier/safer to use than bartering.  
Venezuela is the most current example as their economy was almost entirely reliant on oil, so as the price fell, their fiat became worthless and unstable; so switching to bitcoin made sense, as it is a worldwide currency, a single nation/market collapsing barely affects the price (50% price swings are no big deal when your fiat inflated by 150% in 6 months).  
As the average person learns more about bitcoin and blockchain, the more they believe in it, especially in open source forking, as it directly relates to why it will retain users/value.  Blockchain is as strong as math/science/internet, which are much more reliable than any single nation(and their politics) can ever hope to be.  
And remember the time frame in our examples, western govt bonds are more reliable now and for the US, it will probably stay that way, but that's not the metric.  The metric is how many more people in struggling economies will switch over as their own fiat falls?  Single commodity economies dealing with fluctuating demand; Warzones; Natural disasters.   As the usage goes up, reliability will catch up to western fiat pretty fast.  
edit: forgot a few words
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:41:50
Super cheap and fast?  That's a pretty lofty claim considering the speed on on-chain transactions as well as the comparison to similar services that hop, like Tor.

This type of attack in 100% going to happen in the future, with the advent of quantum computers, govt or otherwise.  
The solution, post-fork, is likely similar to what happened with BCH, where they do a EDA to prevent difficulty from going up too high.  There will be crazy oscillations, but the transactions in general will be usable.

I said safe in the long term.  4 years to me, is not long term; I'm thinking 10-30, in which case bitcoin is safe.  All your examples apply to standard investment liquidity as well.  
The poster didn't claim that those parts of our economy is inherently bad, only that the system is set up in such a way for success of the "economy" as a whole, which often leaves regular people to suffer.  
No one is misrepresenting potential gains (aside from OP), as the very first thing most people say when talking about bitcoin is that it can go to zero tomorrow.

Is this a fair comparison? I thought LN was a type of credit extended to you (holding your funds) until that first confirmation.  It feels more more 0-conf+  ?
I was speaking of a situation of a compromised node, the same weakness of Tor, which is the software/device itself becoming an attack vector?  I don't see the benefit of it over creating a new wallet out of thin air every time  to send transactions?  
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:58:15
Yea, that's roughly the way I read it, I just interpret the info much more pessimistically.  
The initial 0.5BTC from your example to me is similar to a pre-loaded/secure credit card.  Down payment for payment flexibility similar to a credit card.  Security vulnerabilities similar to a credit card company being hacked or intercepted (ie. unlikely but possible).  
My question is, at this point, why not use a that credit card?  It may be marginally cheaper/easier, but not substantially so, imo.

Nah, fiat will never go away, as it is needed for governments to maintain control.  If they only accept taxes in fiat and can legal power over you as a citizen, most people will choose to continue to use a bit of fiat.  
The positive change that hopefully occurs is that governments are forced to be less irresponsible with their spending as bitcoin becomes the ultimate forex benchmark.

How do you know they aren't?  How do you quantify the feedback the community gives to core development vs. the feedback given to bitcoin businesses?  
Not implementing replay protection is the entire point, 2x is intended to replace 1x.  
Businesses putting forth a hard fork when they are unable to come to an agreement with the current devs is exactly how blockchain is supposed to work.  Everyone in the community picks their side.  
I seem to be digger deeper than you since I'm trying to see things from both sides while you seem to be happy to blindly accept what you're being told by one side?

I have that same problem with Coinbase.  It's most likely them, as the apparently route all orders through a British Exchange/Institution.  
They admitted this, yet refused to do anything about it until I got my credit union to get proof.  Then they reimbursed the prior fees in bitcoin.  Problem is still not fixed, but my credit union added zero forex fee to the card, so not my problem anymore...
*edit:  I should probably keep complaining and keep on getting my free BTC, lol...

No reason you both aren't correct.  
Bitcoin is a pretty safe investment, long term, simply based on the fact of open source forking, ensuring that problems get cut out and value is maintained as long as you control your keys.  Short and medium term?  huge risk, especially now with the SW1x and SW2x drama.  
The tirade was just emotional observation of our linked, inflationary economic model that is disconnected from "real world" value.  The pressure from inflation may drive the economy as a whole, but hurts individuals.  
In the future, I forsee bitcoin's role as a universal foreign currency, to restrain runaway inflation and insulate the average citizen from political failings.  National currency will never go away (taxes), but the type of suffering resulting from irresponsible governing seen in Greece and Venezuela will hopefully be minimized.

Individually, you may run into a good fund, but as an industry, it's a pretty much a scam where you bear all the risk/loss, while paying for any gain.  
Firstly, most funds are managed by folks who are not fiduciaries (legally required to put the interests of the client first).  So, most funds are set up to hedge against each other a bit (ex: fund 1= 50% index funds; 30% international stock; 20% bet industry to **up**.  fund 2 = 50% index funds; 30% international stock; 20% bet industry to **down**).  
By setting things up this way, the manager makes his managing fee on both, present his "winning" record to future clients and close out his "bad" funds after a year.  This ensures he has a loyal client base and "some" people make money.  
Remember, in the market, for every winner, there  is a loser; so, why sign up for something where you risk 100% of the loss for a potential 90% of the gain?

There's already objectively better coins out there, bitcoin's only advantage is the brand recognition at the moment.  We're not trying to predict the future, it's a design that can respond effectively to the future.  Again, it's software, anything superior can be incorporated into a future revision of the code.  
A "safe" investment is one with a relatively high certainty of a specific return; profitability is not a requirement (see bond buy ups with negative returns during economic instability).  I don't put in my life savings simply because of my risk profile and other factors (human error in carrying thousands of dollars around; small chance of hacked wallet software; ease of use of fiat; tax purposes; etc).  
I would also definitely take that bet on bitcoin longevity (even though the name may change), as I think you are underestimating a key concept of blockchain that I've mentioned: the open source forking.  
Ex: Quantum computing government attack - They mine every single coin and steal all coins from all wallets, quick sell on exchanges for fiat.  What happens?  
Bitcoin becomes worthless/unusable for months until a dev team creates a patch and forks the chain from a pre-attack date.  You have your keys, so you have equivalent number of "new" coins and wait for the value to recover.  
It's interesting you use S&amp;P + 30yr treasury notes as an example.  North Korea may have missiles capable of a US strike and Trump is antagonizing them further, so I wouldn't be so sure the US/Wall Street would be around in 30yrs, lol.  
@_date: 2017-10-17 21:39:21
You're correct.  
Every time there is a change in the code, it's technically a soft fork or hard fork.  It's just that in the past, everyone was on the same page, so one of the forks always died immediately or spun off as something else (no claim to the bitcoin name).  
Now, with the block debate causing a contentious hardfork, it's become a propaganda war over the bitcoin name.  
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:28:16
So, for small businesses? 
I'm just not seeing the benefit of LN, when the chain has the ability to do that now with open source software combined with the nearly unlimited wallets that are able to be created?
Is LN intended to be a platform to build up beyond peer to peer transactions?

The funny thing is that a core believer of blockchain is that even if we fail the segwit 2x fight or some other centralization scheme in the future, that bitcoin is here to stay.  
Right now, we're fighting over the branding of what is "bitcoin", but it's not like core devs (or soem other random dev) will give up afterwards.  
If segwit2x goes through, then we split and the NYA people make a ton of money in the short-medium term.  Long term, most people will gravitate toward the cheaper, open source alternative.  It'll be an interesting comparison of usage between developing nations and western ones.  
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:22:34
I think you are misunderstanding my question.  
I'm not worried about he coins being stolen, but for the information being directed to a centralized location.  I'm not seeing the benefit of the bouncing when the anyone can easily create brand new wallets anywhere for every single transaction to directly achieve a similar level of anonymity?  
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:44:50
It's how the economy works nowadays.  Everything is based on interconnected "growth".  
To grossly oversimplify, when the economy grows, there is additional "value" that is created, so additional fiat is printed to represent that value.  Nations/people buy up govt debt to "store" that value.  
This sets up a inter connectivity between nations to help each other out economically to keep growing faster than the amount of money being printed (inflation-&gt;purchasing power).   
Consider target inflation rates of the US is 2%, so even without compounding, in your lifetime, you're likely to lose 50% of purchasing power.  Unless the minimum wage is tied to inflation, there is a disconnect between total economic growth and the impact on the everyday person.  
td;dr: the world is getting "poorer" together.  Only people wealthy enough to invest enough to beat the 2% inflation target are holding steady.

What?  I think you misunderstood what I meant by btc1.  
If the segwit2x goes through, they would control the bitcoin brand, so those of us on core would be the minority in the fork and would have to come up with something else (btc1).  
Presumably this would lead to lower price and eventually lower difficulty, so I would get back into mining this as I believe the decentralized will outlast the centralized.  
*edit* I had no idea segwit 2x project was called btc1, lol.  I see the confusion now.

Forex trades are about relative value based on a number of factors and we get into merits of central banking, etc.  The basic takeaway for this discussion is the distribution of risk to maximize the preservation of value.  
The Euro-Greek situation is a good example though.  The Greek economy imploded and because they are part of the eurozone, they were propped up by it and the value of the euro was impacted, but didn't go under.  
Bitcoin is similar, as it is a worldwide instead of a regional currency, any single failing nation won't destroy it.  That stability will make the future of taxation, debt, and reckless government expenditure interesting as a cup of coffee will cost the same even if the government around you falls apart.

Interesting, how do you envision a L2 solution that can have low fees and confirmation times?  
The way I understand it, in things like LN, groups of payment channels (hubs) would make things cheaper as long as you stay within your hub?  I can't see this scale internationally while remaining cheap?  
Also, when these hubs are tied into specific companies, how would they remain censorship resistant (govt has forced backdoors before)?
