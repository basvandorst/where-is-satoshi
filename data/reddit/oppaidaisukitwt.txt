What happened to it rising to 16k?
Cope brainlets.

Because I'm not ameritard.

Maybe you should just consider killing yourself if reading a trivial comment written in plain English is too hard to figure out on your own.

It's objectively not.  
  
It's detached from reality, as evident by it being able to fluctuate more than your moms ass did on my dick last night.

This might be a meme but this is the only reason BTC is 10k EUR right now - it's because people overhyped it and it's totally relevant.
Forgetting the fact that it's not tied to economy, which is bad, considering it's very easy to manipulate (which is why it's price margin is wider than your mom), unlike real economy where things are reluctant to change over short period of time.

I don't even have a wallet to begin with.
Why would I own something irrelevant?  
  
inb4 arguments about how if I never used it, I don't understand it, when you cannot grasp basic economy and try to act smart.

Sorry to break it to you, but 0,4156% (not even half of 1% percent, who woulda thought?) of entire human population having a bitcoin wallet isn't "everyone".
Considering you cannot do basic math, you are just another brainlet who genuinely believes that BTC isn't worthless, goodluck. I hope you don't have a family that will suffer once you lose all your money, because you will.

Gold is at objectively superior to BTC in every single way.

I'm sorry that last week you could afford only two bottles of wine and not entire dinner.
Here's a way to avoid it: use real currency that will allow you to always buy dinner as long as you aren't actually poor. If you live in USA, the best currency to use is USD, cheers.

The fact that it doesn't fluctuate like crazy is why gold is superior to BTC.
It's double edged sword you brainlet, it can also dip so low that you will shit yourself and start crying about losing all money.
And gold just sits here, always relevant, and secure long term storage of money.
@_date: 2019-06-30 07:55:36
Then why aren't you spen... Oh wait I'm sorry, I forgot that you cannot buy anything with it.
@_date: 2019-06-30 10:01:01
This is as good of an argument as me telling you that you can touch gold but not BTC.
I'm sorry that your parents dropped you on your head...
Alright, I admit it, I am wrong, gold isn't superior to BTC in every single way, but you know what is...?
I can buy things online with it, I get paid for my work in it, it's not that volatile and most importantly, it's actually relevant and everyone accepts it no matter what.
In case I lose my credit card, I can go to a bank and have it blocked, then buy a new one, which is pretty cheap, and it was my own fault anyway.
If I get scammed, I can ask my bank to chargeback.
BTC has blockchain though, and it's just so safe and secure, especially when you lose your digital keys to the wallet, or even better, your hard drive dies (keeping it in every hard drive is how you get it stolen with all your money that you cannot charge back).
BTC is all downsides, and it's detached from reality just as much as you are, and holds no actual value in the real world (again, just like you).
But do you know why I mention gold? Because that's what I'd invest into if I didn't want to keep it in form of USD, it's not volatile and I am pretty much guaranteed to get my money back when I need it, and when I do lose it, it won't be x10 times less.

How many people out of 32million who have BTC wallets are actually successful?
@_date: 2019-06-30 08:44:47
The only reason to ever buy BTC is to buy it at 3k, hype it up and promise that it's good investment and it will rise to 60k, then sell it at 19.5k and watch meltdown of r/Bitcoin in 2018 while having effectively sextupling your money off complete idiots who believe that BTC is the future.
You cannot change this historical fact. Have a nice day.
Your argument is irrelevant, because when I'll move, I'll just... Um, you know, will sell my gold just like you have bought BTC to even bother with your totally good idea.
Why you need BTC? Just keep your money  nobody knows how much money you carry in your credit card!
@_date: 2019-06-30 09:35:01
I wouldn't expect you to know what's the point of gold, it's alright.
It's literally more worth it to invest into USD for someone who doesn't have it as a main currency already, than to buy BTC unironically.
Tell me more about how you pay in BTC when you see that you have enough money to buy something, try to buy it, then realize that before you made the transaction, price dropped and you cannot even try to make the transaction anymore.  
Call me when BTC margin won't be bigger than your mother, and I'll consider using BTC in my paychecks.

Why would I need to cross borders with currency that I chose to freeze till sometime in the future...?
Freeze as in, be sure that 10 years later it won't be worthless and irrelevant like BTC.
