Sure, but if a government decided to ban it your ability to make use of it plummets.
Most people won't want to touch it because of a risk of going to jail.
They can certainly seize a hardware wallet from you.  You could also lose it all in a fire.
Pros and cons :)
@_date: 2018-09-04 10:22:54
Well if it were banned, selling it would risk a jail sentence.  They don't fuck about it China.  
The idea that governments can't influence BTC is nonsense.
I can see why it appeals to the conspiratards, but 99.9% of people play by the rules of society.  It's not so bad.  Better than anarchy.  
Some of the "pros" of crypto are also the reasons most people will remain skeptical.  That a burglar with a hammer to my kneecap can run off with it is a con to most of us, not a pro!

Bitcoin addresses aren't exactly secret

And also introduce new problems!

I get the point but you have to pay tax in your local currency so you'll be hit with a fee when you convert back to local.  Or is there a quick fee free way to offload a million BTC?  I'm curious to know if there is a way to avoid someone taking a cut.
Stability would also have to improve!!

Sure, but how would you store the wealth you generate?
I wouldn't store a billion in either.  I'd choose gold if I had to pick one.
@_date: 2018-05-17 16:57:55
He said that "hodlers be like"
So he was equating the two.  Saying people who hoard bitcoin are a bit like people who hoard gold.
Whether this is good or bad is a matter of opinion.  Being it's a bitcoin sub....  a good thing?
You really missed it chap.  Sorry.
@_date: 2018-05-13 20:13:28
I don't get the last bit. How does this facilitate the transfer of wealth over and above previous mechanisms?
The wealthy are already hoarding it :/
@_date: 2018-10-06 14:48:13
Quite.  Most BTC owners won't be circulating it, just hoarding it.  
I suspect another crypto currency will sweep in at some point as a coin that is actually used in practice.
Perhaps something implemented by a tech giant.  Anything integrated into Android, Google pay, apple pay would kill BTC over night.  I mean, what would stop them.  I wouldn't bet my house on btc.

Offline has its own risks.  Plenty of stories around here from people losing their life savings down the back of a sofa. The guy who had to hack his hardware wallet was a good story to follow.
Personally, as long as you don't put all your eggs in one basket, I think you'll be ok.  Some offline, some on mainstream exchange, some on online but encrypted wallet.  If offline,  backup at relatives house and I'd still be weary about being coerced into giving up the BTC.

I think the problem with large scale adoption is the disparity of people's lives in different countries.  
It's very obvious here in the EU where countries such as Greece have been forced to use a currency that's isn't suited to them. Euro. 
Not convinced btc can have a role above and beyond storing or moving.  It's fascinating to follow though.
Do you see this as doable in addition or instead of the banking system?
@_date: 2018-06-08 07:45:53
It hit 20k off the back of hype and is sustained at current levels through people clinging on. 
Until BTC can prove it has a real role we'll not see 100k.  Doesn't mean it can't happen , but I kind of weep for those basing their long term financial security on this.  
Hold some because it's interesting and fun.  
@_date: 2018-06-05 06:51:31
You can get one on Amazon

Also, Wikipedia is equally useful wherever you are.  
Decentralised global systems might sound cool but when you start thinking of the practicalities..
Currencies need some flexibility, that's why each country has its own.  And why the Euro is a bit of a mess that may not survive.  
I can't see one currency working for everyone.  Crypto also offers no protection from when it goes wrong, it's complicated and it's hard to pass on when you die.
Sure, all these things have solutions...  but then you end up with something that looks very much like what advocates are trying to replace.  The more popular it becomes the more governments will have to step in with regulation.  
I don't think it will go away. But I can't see it becoming mainstream any time soon. Not in my lifetime.  But hey, glad if it does, I got some a few years ago by chance...

Also, do we really need the world's electricity tied up in this?

The are pros and cons with all approaches.  You could store your keys encrypted on Dropbox if you wanted.
Having it offline is like keeping your money under the mattress.  Seems crazy to me. Fire? Robbery?  Forget your password. Hardware failure.
You could use a wallet that encrypts so they can't access it without your password.
Or spread it around, have some in a few exchanges. If you lose access to one you don't lose it all.
I dunno, putting eggs in one basket or having it all offline has its own risks too. 
Do what's right for you.
And remember, this whole thing is very very risky.  Don't buy what you can't lose.

Bitcoin transactions aren't free??  Value is skimmed still isn't it? Perhaps it's done in a more distributed way though.

Well yes exactly,  gift cards is a good point.  You can't use one until you give them your card details.  Trust me, I tried, and complained.  And they said it is a non negotiable requirement.
I was gifted a voucher and didn't want it linked to "me".  I wasn't surprised.  It actually makes a lot of sense.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:49:25
Name and post code will cover the vast majority of linking.

That said, even now, if you want to pay by voucher Amazon will insist on you adding a card first.  The same could be true for BTC.
So this argument is silly.
The real problem for them would be volatility.  
But never say never.  We're all really bad at seeing the future....

Given how much voice data is now being collected.  How unique is a voice print and could these people be identified now or in the future?
I love the idea that these idiots are at home sweating, cos one day those voice prints are going to catch up with you and everything you've built in your life is gonna come crashing down because technology moved on.
Like those guys who's DNA fingers them for a crime they did in the 80s and they thought they were home and free.  Must be tough living life, looking over your shoulder... good luck with that.

What about EUR, GBP, CYN, CAD, etc?  Why just the dollar? If my currency stays strong when USD does badly...  how can BTC be a constant across the globe?

So how does this work across the world, people seem to forget that there are many currencies and cultures.  
All other currencies will tank?  The cost of wages and goods will harmonise across the world?
The Euro is struggling and that's 20 odd countries with similar economics (Italy... Yikes).  The idea one currency can work for everyone seems unfeasible?  
@_date: 2016-07-20 17:17:13
So? How'd he do it?
