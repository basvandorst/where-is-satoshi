Bfx interest is to keep price low so people flush all tokens with discount of 60-90% .
Think how much debt is written off that way. Bfx probably have speculators who trades for them and also bfx have knowledge about bids and asks so they can act accordingly.
If price will fall 0.1 that will be the best time to own that scammy business

@_date: 2016-08-05 10:30:06
My view is that insurance was gone in moment they realise private keys were used to released funds. Same as bank would say : did you lost your card and little paper with PIN number? POOOF, we wpnt cover your losses.

Check album to see how fake that site might be.

Thats true also many will be capable of tracing even stolen laundered coins. But i think this will not be the case as attacker is smart and can wait long until touching those funds. He made extra by shorting the fuck of it and now just waiting game.

Mining is not only about making money guys. Sone of people just doing it for fun. I remember someone mined whole block with stick usb miner on slash pool. 
My suggestions buddy is to get antminer but don't count to make gazylion coins. It will create heat, it will create noise you will baby sit also this because of various issues like psu, connection etc.
Instead of mining bitcoin mine shitcoin and maybe trade for btc?

Similar approach like mega. Encrypt all on the fly and owner/admin don't know exactly what sits in their servers. That way they stay in business and no one can pull fast one for copyright crap.
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:07:48

Jus to be clear -- zip is password protected and folder contains 2 files (one music and csv with fake dump)
Passwrd is 33 haracters lond alphanumeric with special characters.
Max was given this next day i had it and confirmed everything is fake.  
Anyway good idea is to change passwrd often to avoid any hack, also 2 fa and browser locking is a must for any serious trader.
I did check as well dump and can confirm md5 hash contains random passwords but i asked one lbc trader if he ever used pass same as in dump and he declined that.
Thanks dinbits for article.

Kyc and AML is imposed on exchanges which imposing this on every user.

My idea is to give extra feee for miners and trasnaction will be confirmed in no time. Always higher fee have higher priority. After 1 confirmation miners will confirm again and agian. And trust me on this one this shouldnt be 30-40 minutes.
Otherwise only multisig or reliable escrow.

Yeah, i get it. But since i started using SW there was never and issue for me to use fee of my choice. Now they made it more visible and more user friendly. Give it a try again.

Guy who was robbed asked for this himself. It was a matter of time. 
He was selling on local bitcoins and usually was showing limits 0-200k , 0-300k per one transaction. Just go ahead and look for yourself other traders with limits like that. Not saying don't do it, but in UK bank would not allow one off transfer to cover 200k so what's the point showing limits like that? 
Beside, there are many stupid enough people who brags about what they do and what's the limits are. 
Just approach anyone from cash list. Ask about limit. They will tell u easy 100k per transaction.

Great little project. Will try do this myself. Question: if mirror brake that means I have bad luck for x years? 
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:57:04
They just announced this. Please start use segwit wallets so 90% tx are segwit and than we can talk. you think change will happen overnight? Beside, users and miners are at fault. check mempool and see what fees will push you through. Dont pay more than u have to and all will be good. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:40:23
Great. Love it. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:19:40
Thank you. Was waiting for someone to say it out loud.  So in other words even that piece of worthless paper is not OP's? So money are belonging to gov and banks, worthless paper(I think is paper) belongs to. Nice. Another reason to use bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:47:49
Start with 50k anything over withdraw untill you got your 50k back. Than you can play Russian roulette with third parties like that. 
Beside, if this was whole savings then stupid move considering good choices with trading made by OP.
I would say SAR was filled, deppends what country OP is should be painless for him as long as he can prove legitimacy of funds. 
In UK banks can fuck you for 14-20 days straight without telling you anything. After that they have to give access to funds of SAR is filled against you. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:15:03
Don't forget cheaper tx fees.
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:27:02
why not use wallets with replace by fee option? you can always bump up if needed?
Normal to me is paying normal fee. maybe if you was using segwit wallet like samurai wallet and paid proper fee you would be more happy. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:52:06
Most likely gagging order. Police or tax office got SAR and they checking u out. Otherwise scammy service is in my mind.

You do realize changelly using bittrex and adding just more fees to same trading directly with bittrex. Yes I would avoid changelly and risk my btc directly with Trex. And no. This is not noob mistake going directly to the source. But hey, if you like paying extra for better looking package use changelly than..
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:11:52
Why changelly in first place? They expensive, they typically slower than any exchange, they using bittrex.
You sent btc to them, why not directly to bittrex and buy that way? Less fees to pay, you can cost average your coins.

Take it out as withdraw cash. Yes. Branch have nothing to do here. They are happy to accept 10k from me but 30 minutes later they will not give you that back. 
You have to ORDER cash and anything over certain amount will be validated by questions and answers on their form. 
Unplanned Overdraft is a trap for people with poor credit history. Unplanned overdraft should not exist. If you take anything over for example with lloyds they will charge for 20p overdraft fee which is more than that 20p. 
Plain and simple, if you have no money that mean empty pocket but bank will allow you to spend more than you have and charge you for this "buffer". 
So you telling me you showed up in bank and said : fuck you all I want my money(60k)...and they gave it to you?maybe you transferred. I'm taking about taking money away from bank.
About charges think what you posted. You have 0% u saying? So why MasterCard and visa than? You think all that in charity work?
Off-licence.still asking for minimum of 5-10£ in London. 
Ok. When did you had your deposit done? I am locabitcoins trader and I am familiar with most of banks and now if you haven't.got account with Bank you depositing to, they will send you away. 
Barclays, HSBC, lloyds and RBS in particular. 
I never said it's illegal to use ATM. 
I said by using it you changing money from one form to another which is considered as money laundering .
I know as I head pleasure to deal with TARIAN. When I was trading using locabitcoins s and cash.
All was good as I always paid taxes on my trading but been through a lot and found out a lot.
If ATM thing is all fine why you mention anything money laundering issue? If you have card , balance and all good why limiting ATM with low limits? 
Because bank loosing trace of money once you picking this up as cash. They don't like it.
Ohhhh and most important. In bank , WHAT EVER YOU HAVE OVER THERE ITS NOT YOUR MONEY. 
Having cash in pocket , you can call it YOUR MONEY.
Good luck in sheep land.

Heh, because for day to day bitcoin usability im happy the way it is. Combine good wallet with segwit and you can deliver payment for as little as 5 satoshi a byte. this will be delivered within first block or second. 
Im just waiting until you will bring cost in $ instead of satoshi. 
Beside of all this bcash as others altcoins have no usability in real world. Bitcoin have and its growing. 
By LN i can even pay for everyhting much faster than bcasj and others combine. so again? why you commenting like you have a clue?

@_date: 2018-05-12 16:18:53
Yeah, yeah .... 50usd before we had LN and segwit. Dont forget spam from your camp to to make bitcoin as less usable as possible, but yet this attempt failed too. What bcash did apart forking and copy/paste? 
LN is work in progress beside you wouldn't be here if not bitcoin. Any idiot can fork bitcoin. We seen it all the time. But look at the charts, looks at the price, look at people behind "work in progress" and what you will see is real progress. Not shilled using sock puppets, progress not build on deception. 
Just pure and natural growth made thanks to people and companies which acctually doing something without deception and tricks. 
If you think i have no clue and bitcoin dying i suggest dump all your btc and tell that to others, as bitcoin dying for 9 years now. and yet still works as intended.

UK banks u saying....so once u have 10k and deposit that u can just come back 30 minutes later and take it out???
I don't thinks so, not even mentioning overdraft which shouldn't be in the account in first place. 
They calling buffer , and some account have even up to 5% typical income in there. It's a trap, made to help you in case u have that 1-5£ short to buy something...
Sick!!! If you have 0 that means you cannot buy anything. 
You can have 60k in account and now the best part, try to take it out as you don't wanna business with a bank anymore....good luck with that. 
Deposit? Max 1000£ ,taking in to account you have bank acc with that bank. 
You saying you not paying for account, a and tx? What about charges which are added when u using your card...trust me those charges exist. Merchants adding them on top of everything. Why in off-licence there is minimum 5-10£ spend limit? 
Wait for negative interest rates on personally accounts, you will all going to be shocked.
And now fun fact:
By withdrawing money from ATM technically u laundering money according to TARIAN, south Wales special police force.
Yes, by getting tx from your bos and withdrawing by ATM you technically commuting a fraud. That's why you have limits on certain ATM /cards 300/500/800( Heathrow) a day. But if you will use that limit and will take cash out.for 7 days bank will start asking asking question or even suspend your account with your money and will grass u up to NCA.
Faster payments takes sometimes 24h to clear.
Some banks using excuse of fraud preventing, but how you can prevent fraud when u sending to yourself?
Transfers are free but.you not moving anything more than digits, balance like in PayPal. 
Also only domestic tx are free. Rest have charges. 
Good luck all.

First of all, I never had issue with banks because my money are not in there. I do one transfer a month to pay bill and that's all. Cards are unused. Cash is king. I haven't got issue with all you. Just shared part where I found myself in situation or know someone who had issue which I mentioned. 
Secondly. I'm not as typical Brit with no savings, with maxed out credit cards and cars on HP waiting for end of month to close another cycle. 
I have enough savings in form or estate and others so no have to worried about my or my kids futures. Never had even one loan or finance. Life without it is much more easy and i can show middle finger to banks. Also  account has minimum I need to make transfer to pay bills and that's all. Thanks to that each month I am focused on doing my bit and not stressing about unnecessary things. 
UK banks are unfortunately hostile and full of shit. And people really have no clue what to expect when on account is basic salary of 20+k a year. 
Problem piles up when you have more savings and more money than average Joe. Than when you want your money back bank treating you like enemy or fraud. 
 Time to wake up, nobody is doing anything as charity.

what a nonsense. without help of tools you wont build house.
Same with bitcoin.
Without services arround bitcoin you wouldnt be able to spend ONLY btc in your small community.
Btc for the same people in small community have value in USD/GBP/EUR end of story.
Before anyone will accpet your bitcoins they checking value of it. Based on rate in typical currency for your region.
Take you btc and go for trip for shoping. Start with tube/metro/bus/train, later buy what u need and maybe go eat something with it.
I can bet you  not only will stay in your place(lack of transport), you wont buy desired items and most importantly you will be hungry. Thats true.
@_date: 2016-03-25 11:47:22
you see, first rule of trading is : keep your private shit separated from trading.
Lloyds is real pain due to silly billy apporach to trading. 
You have most likely chargeback from one of your buyers.
Now funny part is : bank cannot remove any money without your consent but by freezing all of your money they will force you to say "yes". 
most likely you will have worning to not use private account for business use and thats all.
But in some cases you might get 60 days notice letter. which means your account will remain opened for 60 days and after that over.

your belowed bank network is expensive, evolvrd but its still expensive and it wont change. 
any transaction can be chargeback, even cash deposit.  banksters ripping people on daily basis. best example is creating money from signature on mortgage contracts. yeah ,there is nothing more reassuring than fake money created by bank from thin air. wanna see your face in couple years time when there is no turning point with btc and all will aknowledge existence....

Once they will close one 100% sure other will get shut too.
Bank most likely raised flags regarding incoming transactions. Probably you was getting wages to this account and you didnt made any operations similar to trading btc. Banking systems will flag if account start "behaving" different than before.
Example: if usually you small spender and you will try buy something big like tv for 2k or car for 5k they will block transaction.

what's convenient than Btc? insured? stable?
sepa within EU cost about 10-30£ and takes 2-5 days.
Bitcoin takes seconds , fee is in cents/pennies. no one asking stupid questions why oh why I'm sending over X amount.
insured??? up to 80k and rest ---life man. 
stable, definitely. Greece was perfect example of stable banks and financial institutions. ATM empty, limits on transfers, limits on cash withdraw per day. yep, very stable.

Weekend network works faster due to less congestion. Miners not prioritising tx based on fees. So every tx which is broadcasted with fee is confirmed in no time.
Wait for tomorrow and you will see that again network is slower due to higher volume of tx and miners will again pick only highest fees to be confirmed /included in block.

think about it. if the miners have all week 5 working days(monday to friday) to choose between high fees and make more by selecting only these tx and low fee and make less which one they will choose? 
beside only weekdays you can see spike in unconfirmed tx and weekend all this backs to normal and small fee tx confirmed in no time. 
If miners haven't got to many tx to choose from they will take any tx to make money or btc from fees.

So you saying 4 decades on earth and you didn't spot social engineered attack to create hundreds more millions by spreading FUD?
Tool ver and jihan used btc they had to buy alts like eth, dash and few others and they create BU to pump them up. Dont forget ver was so in to shitcoins because btc will fail. When dust is gone they already cashed in to btc and gradually start also rebaying cheap coins with fiat funds they probably had from otc or something. 
Please look back in threads history on reddit and check yourself. Since they started spreading BU fud price declined and shitcoins went up due to lack of faith in btc. Anyone with a brain of a chicken could do that. Now ver and jihad is laughing and BU is over. Its not needed anymore. Weekend was the best time to manipulate any xchange due to small volume on them. Saturday and Sunday was created with only 100/300btc per dump. We had about 3/4 dumps and same pattern happened with same amount of btc.
Who knows how much they made by shorting bitcoin since fud started.

Deposits in general are safe as long as you not doing huge amount over short period of time.
Now tricky part is that banks can flag you for money laundering reasons and you will have to answer few question before they will "allow" your money to be used the way you want it.
Think about it that way: banks have knowledge whats average wages on monthly basis. So they know that if for example you making 25k a year maximum which comes in and out should be 25k in and 25 out. Anything above they might treat as suspicious. If you out if the blue doing more than your usual income they might ask question.
Money laundering looks like that: putting money as cash and taking in different form. Or having money in bank account and using atm to withdraw funds. Banks don't know where cash came from where from transfer they have account which sent money and thats why transfers are less suspicious than cash deposits.

Regardles if you want be richer or not buy btc just to back up your believes. Reward will come to you and investment will bring back nice profit. Banks give shitty 3-4% for year. With btc easily you can do more. Now question is how much you believe in btc and if you can do something to prove it do it. If it will go down at halving, you still have investment. Later will go up and this will pay you back lack of profit at halving.

Read second link to tweeter to understand what's exactly mining capitulation is. Pirate jack explains how to spot this sell off. 
Problem for miners is price of BTC. Different countries have different power cost etc. 
China I think have cheapest electricity, they can still mine at 3-4k while others near 6k are not profitable. 
So others who are not profitable simply capitulate by selling gear and coins.

Seriously? 
UK Politicians are jokes. Regardless of which partie their are.
First when UK joined to EU everyone was complaining about imigrants like polish etc. Because they :
Stealing jobs, nhs queues, benefits, womans{sick i know}.
Most of those who came to UK from EU working hard, having business running, paying taxes, buying houses etc.
What they have in return? Only insults, lies about numbers and in overall bad treatment.
Now brexit is full speed and most of sheep have no clue what to do. They watching BBC which lies more than most of politicians. They listen to radio and reading one sided the sun and others.
Brexit is needed to make clean air. Once many EU imigrants will get back UK will test stability between english people who basically dont wanna work due to handouts, and those who wanna work but have no clue what and how to do because they simply didnt have oportunity to learn or get experience.
Cameron is such a hipoc.....How many time he was against EU and their Laws and now hes doing what he can to stay?
My little rant over now to the point:
Cash every single penny to BTC and please dont worry. Bitcoin will deffend itself. Price will go up eventually and you will have more than today.
If you consider using btc only you are winner regardles if GBP will go up or down.
BTC as of now is the best shield from banks, politics, GBP itself , interest rates which once got negative will make big whole in every bank account.
UK before EU was doing...oh well was doing something. EU didnt chnage a lot apart more people paying taxes. 
Keep believe in BTC and dont let anyone tell you different.

@_date: 2016-06-14 18:59:32
Think about this way:
Halving means block will contain 12.5btc instead of 25btc. If there is less supply but demand remain or going up that means bitcoins will only gain and price will be higher.
Of course you are right by saying about price drop but that due to profit taking whales which waits for price to get to certain level. Once profit take is done price will fall and then stabilize at some level.

What a bunch of nonsense. Nice advertisements but with few things which are so obvious. KYC should be done before anything will hit your accounts. Every self respecting company dealing with money does that BEFORE deposit. So get a hike with your kyc bollocks. Bitscamgold behaved typically like scammer. Allow deposit and then hit with bogus claims about kyc. Even if OP was laundering money you should do aml and kyc first and monitor whats happen next. But noooo, lets allow poor muppet to send cash and we going to behave like scammers and eventually hes money will be ours.

First of all, u getting 2% cash back cos cc charging mega high fee to merchant and to you also so they came up with idea of cash back to look like giving back your money. But reality is ,Please consider % on top of each transaction you paying for line of credit given by cc company. If your cc charging 5% on merchant side + 20pence for each transaction and then there is surcharge for you for using cc cards+ you have to pay more because of cc rules  and they will pay you back 2% from amount u spent. I think thats not really great cashback and deal. Now if you want to pay less and more easy buy coins and hodl. Within year you will have easily 20-30% more which is better than 2% from cc. If not use p2p exchange or fellow p2p broker to buy coins for less. 
Also this thread looks like another fud to keep bitcoin in shadow of cc companys. 
My view is : you doing it wrong sir.

My friend if you long enough on lbc you know this and no shills is needed. Every serious seller know this. From my perspective if system flagged you that means the system works and you or your account is somehow connected to scam or attempted scam. Always was like that. How many times we heard same old story about force holiday and people affected .
And I'm not getting paid by lbc , you came to reddit to make your case visible and to get comments. 
I commented but because you don't like the fact its not "your way" comment so you accusing me of shill for lbc.

To begin with, sorry to hear for your loss. 
Secondly, lbc haven't got mobile app because of exact reason which is security/safety.
If they had they would be targeted more than happens now. 
Fake apps are the biggest issues. Think that way: if lbc haven't got app , then its good reason for this.
2fa wasn't on? Because as far as 2fa can help no chance of stealing coins without it. 
If remember right you need to allow app with lbc to trade, release etc.
Local trader works that way. Also if u had browser safety feature on you would be more secure than without it.

If came up empty, that means he recovered using word seed? If that so than on hd wallets all must be synced before showing balance. 
As of now to fully sync u need a not of time. Try explain how did you recover this wallet. 
With word seed u can recover to any wallet u like but some need sync with network to show full balance.

Idea is good. But without tech like coin join this is just automated work for sending coins 5 tines to different wallets.
Why not try to mix with some tumbling tech to even make more stealth? 
As of now if i want to make sure no one is tracking me i can send coins to myself few times, deposit to let say satoshi dice and withdraw this to make sure coins cannot be easily tracked.

Buy coins, dont go mining route. ROI. Not possible and you will end up playing " fools game" which is buying more gear to mine and try to get any profit.
If for example :
You bought in february 100btc at todays rate you would have x2.5 more than in february.
Usual ROI IS HAPPENING AFTER  12 months. 
Warranty for gear is 3 month , what if after that time you will get faulty miners? No roi.
Better buy coins and hodl. Buy few nodes and support btc that way.

Hacker for sure got enough coins from shorting that even. Same like with DAO. Look DAO HACKEr had no need to play with hacked funds.
Same here. He got tons of coins going 100x or even 500x against market. With just 1btc u can leverage your position to 500btc. Insane profits.

Dont get this wrong way but you might be subjected to SAR by them to police. Simply they wont answer on any questions until "review is resolved" due to TipOff laws or something like that. Basically anyone saying anything about ongoing case might go to prison for tippin you off. That's supossed to allow law enforcement be few steps in front you. Same tactic banks and other institution having. Basically tied up hands and mouth shut as hell.
Just read responses from them and read my comment again. Look also in google for tip off laws and stuff like that.
If you really made deposit using bitcoins only pray that those coins not linked to dark market etc. maybe you bought from someone coins and now they traced it to bitgold as you verififed with them.
Look for other signs like frozen bank account, funny messages. In UK banks have 10 days after SAR was filled to release any funds. Thats 10 working days. But catch is they wont tell you when SAR was filled.

Be polite but don't defend yourself, attack instead. Create blog about your situation on blogspot or something which is fast indexed. Start new reddit here linking to it . Bad publicity with facts will push bitscamgold to act faster. Your own blog have massive advantage: you are creator and no one can take it down. Bear in mind shills working hard even in this rhread to discredit you not bitgold. 
Be careful what u writing but straight to the point. Allow comments and wait and see. You will succeed.
Even if not they will have nice blog against them. Refrain from posting private sensitive data.
Spread news on bitcointalk.org , bitcointrading forum, reddit , paxfull forum, localbitcoins forum about your blog and issue. All these places dealing at some point with bitgold. Trust me there will be response.

Okcoin warning is clear about loses of funds which are borrowed to margin traders.
Poloniex haven't got this warning but i wood be careful with statements that they loosing funds.
Simple fact is that margin trading engine liquidate position when margin is called at 80% level so account cannot get to - level at anytime. 
So if you borrow x amount and have valid collateral when margin calls that position 20% is acting as buffer to not allow account going in to debt/red etc.
How the he'll its possible to loose? Might be flash crash but again margin calls and positions are shut before collateral is all gone. 
Please check if you haven't got opened loans or pending loans. 
Seems to me risk is adequate to reward. Which in this case means "low".

Nothing to trezor a lot to blue from ledger. 
I asked simply what does it better than iphone without sim card with preloaded wallet?
Lets compare: ledger have screen(iphone too), battery (both), bitcoin wallet(both), security(both).
So what you saying is that , iphone is different because its mass production? What about ledger? Did they only made 5 of them and thats all? 
Im not defending apple or trying kill idea behind blue but just compared simple iphone to specially made device to show that hd wallet with screen and battery can be done not only using blue.
Still no one can justify price of 229€ of this wallet. 
If this blue will defend me from physical attack i dont know , maybe build in taser gun or pepper spray than price would be justified. But as of now sorry but i dont see it.

Lloyds/halifax same group. One warning and 60 day notice about closure upon first chargeback. System of lloyds group like to lock funds over x amount when transferring so you have to call them and reply to questions they got. They recording this so in the future they can asses if you are honest customer.
If you will lie , they eventually will find out. To many weird transaction on account will raise their flags. 
If chargeback occurs YOU have to ALLOW them to remove the money. They cannot remove anything without your authorisation. Otherwise they cannot do anything without green light directly from you. Of course they will intimidate you with freeze on all funds. 
Don't be chicken.
Do not mix trading with personal life.

I salute you for what you did. Many or most just bragging about how much they have...."on paper" but most or all of them are scared to even cash 1btc in most positive uptrend like this. Because 10 - 1 is 9 and not 10 again. 
Than crash happens and all that millions they got on "paper" are gone and another stressful times coming and biting their asses. 
All those who shouting "hodl" never thought what they will do or when will they cash those btc when they rich 100k? 200k fuckit 500k. There will be always reason to not sell. At some point they will be still in rented place or mom's basement but hey...they still got 10btc.
My view is, Satoshi gave u something and if u vise enough you can have what ever you want without feeling bad when "cashing". Don't keep all eggs in same basket.  So buy house, buy flat, buy land maybe when btc is for 200k in year or two you choose to build house using those btc. 
And most importantly, great choice u made as you secured your future better than anyone who didn't cash out and done same thing. 
Maybe in year time we will see 10x more expensive btc and I hope for that, but don't forget all that in year time everything else can be 10x more expensive. So u back in square 1.

Business account application contain question about nature of business. If you lie and they will find out eventually you end up in square one.  
Simple example: coinfloor exchange. Its uk business but accounts in europe. None of the banks wanted to deal with them even though they have all paperwork to operate like professional money service business. 
Ohh yeah , don't forget that banks also fills SAR to NCA for some of transactions so worth to be on the right side with taxes, licensing and all that stuff.

As long as you not buying bigger bars(which is even more stupid than buying big bars with premium) you will be fine.

Junk silver and gold is still gold and silver. It's just for examples coins which was circulated and does not fit category "uncirculated or new" many places reputable places will sell.you junk silver. Just Google this term in your area. Research more and don't overpay or pay premium. Investment is an investment. So therefore it does not matter if you have junk (old) no premium or premium sealed bar.

I can easily point people complaining about delay in getting hands on miners which was paid already. I can point where people complaining about rising diff for ltc mining due to jihad playing with "those people" miners.
I can prove that jihad didnt had any issue with software in L3 as he said and that was excuse just to get gear to block segwit.

Bitcoin miners as u call it is electronic device like mobile phone or tv. You can buy electronics from china using fiat, cc , paypal etc. 
So sneaky is right word.
Recent ltc miners which was paid that way was held hostage to block segwit on ltc. If other way than btc was used trust me jihad would loose a lot from chargeback.
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:50:20
Wait a fucking minute.... so you saying that :
1. Pump XRP to over 2xx% within minutes and than dumping shitloads of them caused people lost money?
2. That poloniex didnt inside trading so people was forced to loose?
3. That accounts was unable to withdraw due to heavy traffic and therefore many tried margin trading and lost second time?
 
4. Then after mega dump everyone got acces to poloniex and they noticed positions was liquidated due to margin call?
Damn. I really think you making this whole up.��
My coins are safe, was only lending to margin traders. 
But to add shady practices:  
My coins was lended with auto-renew switched off.
And once i noticed shortly after crash my coins was returned and never lended again.
How weird....

I think your statement about acquiring coins is way overblown. Simple fact is btc is going up so quickly and constantly that if you bough 1btc a month since the begginig of this year probably coffe would cost you 3/4 cheaper than shop selling it. 
Think that way...i had coins from 200£ range and now they are worth 470£ 
If you buying coins only when you want to spend it than yeah, you probably paying more. But still typical  btc buyer will hold to small portions of it.
If you allowing banksters to hold your money why not hold it yourself in bitcoins? 
Not all of it but let say 1/3 for example?

basically you sending them opendime with instruction how to redeem that bitcoin.
Once they get package they will respond. After msg exchanges you will establish they got opendime and that will be enough to prove they got what they bought. But with paypal remember buyer always can do chargeback through CC regardles if paypal agree or not.

No need of any wallet at airport. Just set wallet on other side and transfer coins from one to another. Whats the point of complicating things. Bitcoin have no borders. Why limit itself to walking with hardware wallet? When you can literally go in underwear,  travel and still deliver what you have to deliver to other country.
But really moving so much money through borders must be connected to some shady practices. And its a lot of money.

Seen many times rollercoaster and there is always dip to buy. 
And if you buying monthly some coins basically your rate averaging so sometimes is more but sometimes is less. Once this is taken in account you still end up with cheap coins and cheap stuff.
If you go and buy 1000$ laptop with 20% discount than you still are better of and still got cheaper stuff. Please try and buy something with discount like that using cc or cash... Maybe stolen goods will be cheaper but yet still no saving. Being own bank is so flipping cool

U mined using computers. Proof of mining? There is plenty of data in blockhain. Beside if you know what they after why you asking people here? 
And beside.of all this, why did you go with money to bank? 
Who sane will show money to biggest scammers and crooks at the same time? 
What's for you not small sum? 
Next time do the home work before making any moves. 
Close account in that bank, open else where, transfer money and sorted. 
Banks have right to ask about where funds come from but you have also right to show them middle finger.
Worst case scenario they will fill sar on your ass and same story with police. 
Bitcoins mined on computer. U got bitcoins as a gift from family, or what ever reason which didn't give hope of getting any receipts etc. 
I mean you already screwed yourself by going to bank with cash but hey, we all learning.

So you saying that team viewer scammers doesn't exist? So you saying cash deposit are safer than bank transfers? 
Did you heard about accounts verified with 1000+ and still used to scam? 
Please research first before posting nonsense. Lbc doesn't take any responsibility in case of loss due to scams. Verifications on their side is only purely to operate further and not being shut down by regulators. JUMIO is nothing. It doesn't help in anything for sellers.
If you don't develop own technique  how to verify buyer than you might as well just throw money back in the drain. 
You saying there is no law? Simple kyc and Aml applies here. Lbc doesn't provide id to seller. It stays internally. How the hell seller will know that buyer is not minor?

seriously you think JUMIO on lbc is enough to net verify selfie+id?
I suggest you start trading and see for yourself how many verified account scamming. JUMIO is not for seller is for account owner and lbc to verify id and get copy of that id to archive.
Most of pro traders will not deal with anyone who didnt verify himself at least once with someone known.
Why DL cannot be obscure? Because in case of any scam at least seller have your details and can chase you with police or privately. Card details usually are allowed to be obscured, in some cases sellers asking to not obscure sort code and bank account. 
I wont tell you why because that to much info for someone who just buying bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-01-27 13:14:35
Simply: create full size instruction regarding private keys, public keys , amount of crypto. Save it as QR codes.
Add info about what exchange to use how to cash out in case of death.
Create info about hd wallet if u using one. 
All done on air gapped computer. 
Split your info in to 2-4 prices and spread accros your family. 
Save also one copy 50-50 and hide in safe place.
In case your family will not work together there will be another way to get to your stash.
Make sure that whomever gets that info is not aware what's it's all about.  
Only your other half or kids will know for sure. 
Also having someone close to you who is crypto savy will definitely help. 
And lastly the best solution is to educate your other half how to... In case of bad situation like death.

If you dealing with bitcoins please don't defend banksters company. 
Coinbase sucks, primarily target is no profit but kyc and aml towards ordinary people. Why coinbase tracking what you spending coins on? If its gambling or another exchange they will close you quickly.
If thats no banksters way of control i don't know what is.
No one have right to track my spendings, if i want spend for pizza or hookers that shouldn't matter.

My bet is that OP used IP address of someone who is known to binance(IP range) or user using different account.
Its kyc and most likely some third party trigger for safety reasons.
Or there is another possibility that OPs funds was deposited from scummy address and binance trying to put face to the funds.
One way or another its purely for kyc reasons in my opinion.

It might be something silly like vpn IP address u using for example. IDK. But yesterday i did withdraw big amount of ont and no issue. If you do not wish got through KYC than only dex is the answer. But again, none of known dex have liquidity as big as cex like binance.

Your btc are gone, who ever got them have them for good. Your 5% means nothing in compare to 100% lost because of hack. Your treats about agencies, analysis etc is pointless. Wait for new wallets with mixing features , wait for coinjoin etc. And who ever got coins will be laughing at bfx.

Simple : hodl like no tomorrow. 
Screw lenders. Since bitcoin showed up in my life never thought about cc or loan like before. 
Beside situation on property market (uk) is so fucked up its beyond of everything.  
Houses are overpriced, paying rent 1000£ dosnt mean you can afford mortgage with repayment of 800£.
If you buy house you still need to fork it more for redesign as uk houses are so shit.
New houses to expensive to buy so shared ownership is suggested for new buyers..... but guess what??? U own only 30% of property , rest is rent. Thank you but no thank. Once btc will hit 10000 a piece i will buy place without mortgage.
Over and out.

Coinbase is completely different business than stamp. First of all, coinbase is backed by banksters and their practices and actions basically follow footsteps of those banksters. Coinbase customer care only responds when reddit post shows up.
Bitstamp on the other hand have nothing to do with banks(investment) and customer care are awesome.

anything else.....????

How hack was done? Did they disclose it?

Yep, you right. But value if that worthless IOU is going down fast. USD is not the same as it was 10-15 years ago. If thats not a sign of weak legs i dont know what is. Trust is more important than anything when dealing with cash/currency. Any of EUR/GBP/USD havent got any of my trust. And thanks to that approach i have big smile on my face.

@_date: 2016-10-01 12:25:29
Ok, first thing first: 
Is it bitcoins which are tainted and on hold or money you tried to use to pay for coins at coinbase?
Secondly, if for any reason you do brokerage and trying make money that way probably you done by mitm or similar crap.
Coinbase and blocked funds? Not the first time i see this.

Really? UK and robust banks? Faster payments was allowed to only biggest one and even than faster payment means something between 6-24h.
Let's talk debit cards.....fueling car and cannot pay because UK banks have issue. 
Ok. Maybe coincidence. What about interment banking and SMS factor authentication which doesn't deliver messages so in practice funds are not send.
We are living in 21st century. And banks are like 20th century.

Another manipulation same as at the Brexit voting and after day. Soros dumped shitloads of GBP to scare the shit investors and ordinary people. Flash crach most likely happening when there is sell off due to bot malfuncion which triggered at certain level. It might be manipulation to create fear and even bigger sell off. Please bear in mind GBP price was stable at some point and flash crash happened. This means people(investors) was confident about position of GBP. There was no need to lower price or dump because of fear.
In other words GBP is another shitcoin without future. Bitcoin hodler dont care. Bitcoin didnt suffer.

To link address to person you need landing pad like exchange where you filled your kyc requirement.
Otherwise there is no chance they will link anything to any person. 
Beside if this will become a a problem I bet people will come up to counter measure which will kill Amazon service. 
Check for example samourai wallet. You can send payment using paynyms.
So nobody will be able.to track you. 
LN is another answer. 
You can transact as many time as you want of chain.

*...Btc-E.com had 568,355 users hacked in October of 2014
Btc-E.com data contains usernames, emails, passwords, ip addresses, register dates, languages and some internal data such as how many coins the user had.
They used some unknown password hashing method which currently makes their passwords completely uncrackable although that may change. This is good because if the passwords were easy to crack, hackers could log into the exchange and start stealing members Bitcoins....*

If I sell Btc cos I know it will go down I will have more Btc once all rebuy at the right moment. 
If I sell Btc for 2000$ and rebuy 1900$ did I loose?
All this hodl crap is made purely for others to profit while most of people sitting doing nothing and smiling for paper profits. Untill profit is not taken , u have no profit. Untill Btc is not sold and buy back more expensive there is no loss.

AML and kyc will kill you business. As you need to be sure you not buying stolen btc. 
Next big thing is , how you will be paying for btc . If bank transfer then you screwed big time. Banks will ask reason behind opening account. If you lie this is not illegal or against law but you will be most likely shut down fast and your name might land on CIFAS at certain category. Most likely category which describes misuse of bank account. Once you on CIFAS you virtually done in UK . None of the banks will do any business with you(under your name) , none of the services using credit score and CIFAS.org will do any business with you. If cash , than money laundering will kill you even faster. As cash tx are harder to operate than banks transfers. 
UK is fucked up country to do any business with crypto. That's why some company's have dormant business done in UK but banking accounts in Europe . Also banks eventually will fill SAR against your account which means you will be checked by NCA and maybe other gov bodies. 
Sorry to say, but.you have to be creative in UK if you want to do any business.

OP is right but not fully right. Of Course govs will introduce even more restrict kyc and aml to keep people away from exchnages like you mention. But biycoin is not = fiat. Bitcoin is bitcoin. There is no issue to sell bread for 0.005btc now. Fiat is not needed. Its long process to embrace fully but imagine :
Little town, everyone working (privately, comercially) in town and using only btc as payment method.  So coffe shop charging in btc, local farmer paying with btc and also charging for local veg.
If everyone had no fiat because there was only btc natural thing would be to embrace it and use it as usual £€$. 
Trading between towns would be in btc and slowly bit by bit you would see rise of new era. Where people are own bank. No one need any shiity bankster. 
Ok , what about loans, mortgages etc....
Answer is simple: p2p lending in btc.
Same as typical bank. With small difference, people would be own bank and own line of credit.

Most of treZor issues is :
1. Usb cable failed
2. Trezor bridge on pc is crap or after update is not there anymore
Trezor as a device can fail but u are given seed so u can recover all coins from device.
Personally i sold many trezors to friends , im using one and seriously only usb cable fail happened to me once.

of course you right comparing this to gold silver or oil. But problem is that for all this bullion gov still have plans. They still controling a lot of it. While bitcoin cannot be controlled. price maybe controlled but not a big problem though. 
gold can be seized and is dangerous to keep this at home , someone will find out and u done. Gold cannot be trasported in larger quantity over borders without attention. Can you see why bitcoin is such revolution?

Many hodlers have similar problem. They bought btc high and now hodling for price to brake even or make money. If you consider btc as future curremcy no point sell off for fiat. At some point you will be using btc as normal fiat. Its a matter of time. 
Why sell for 3000 when base price willl be 3200 and u end up buying less for more? 
Did you noticed 1$ 15 years ago could buy you x of lolipops while now you can probably get 2 max for it?
Now 1$ worth bitcoin purchased 3 years ago could buy you nothing but what about now? When 1btc is 650$ ? Do you see why bitcoin is better as based currency, why people should hold and not sell at all? 
Only traders do that to make fiat money because they can predict when dip is coming and rebuy coins back. 
Bitcoin is not here to be something to flip over and over again. Btc is here to fix world finances.

please read again, western union is expensive, non working service which soon will be finished due to "cash less" society. In london most of those who operates have issue with : access and pay out, amount of money, extended kyc just to get my money. 
Bitcoin can be send to every part of the world too for cents in fee. 
Western union is only in place where it is now due to time and work which been put to make it popular. bitcoin is new , fresh idea. just wait couple more years. dont expect that bitcoin will become bigger than anything in place now in shorter time. 
Think that way: remmitance is cheaper and much faster with btc. soon nfc payments will be as standart, no kyc, no id and no silly billy rules regarding how much i can take/withdraw.

@_date: 2016-07-04 14:48:53
Thats why you should look for something different to invest than your own bank. If you going for loan they dont check how much money you have but how your credit score looks like. So u might have 0 on account after wages and that wouldn affect decision of loan. People mistakenly think that they need to keep money in bank to look more credible for that bank.
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:02:22

You have screenshots , you have all facts right. The only thing for me is like WTF WITH THIS 200k withdrawal. Thats surely flagged your account. You should stay on low lever and every 2 days submit new random low number like 20k or 14k to bank and rest in crypto to various wallets. 300k would be easy to move out .
