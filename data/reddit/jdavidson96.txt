The reason I sold all mine
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:00:43
Got about the same percentage as you too for my investment !
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:31:48
So far so good, always stuck with Apple as it goes hand on hand with my MacBook etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:13:52
Btw I have bit coin I’m just so amazed at what is happening lol
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:26:46
When someone else sells
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:12:36
I ha e moved out of bitcoin at 13,000£ with all mine in XRP, this is only a fraction so I am happy. Yeah don’t day trade I tried it and lost out lol must be the norm
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:30:47
It’s now free I had to pay transaction it was on the transaction link
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:40:46
Spend it 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:35:16
You put your money in to bitcoin for what?
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:23:16
I don’t think my £400 investment would get me rich
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:41:47
Oh yeah I know buddy, got in 0.20c so sitting good. Even if it hits $5 I will be very very happy 
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:03:41
That’s bitcoin for you
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:55:55
I bought in at 4000£ 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:21:00
Leaked information about leaked information ��
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:06:27
Love this 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:20:08
I now use coin stats
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:24:00
It’s the future for the banking industry 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:33:21
Spam fuck off
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:31:08
Yeah worked that out thanks
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:31:59
I love Coinbase and GDAX, never had any problems 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:47:35
Great comment , willing to hear
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:00:36
Coinbase - GDAX - binance 
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:56:34
I’m sure they are selling there BCH to another exchange so they will not lose any money 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:02:48
So if I get a hardware wallet can I store my bitcoin ether and ripple ? Is there transaction fees from Coinbase to hardware and hardware back to Coinbase if I wish to sell my bitcoin / ether?
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:07:39
Imagine going to a bank and being put in a queue that long to transfer to your friend ?
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:00:39
Could have and then sell at the current rate so they are up, could be a business plan but I don’t really like the way business can dedicate what they do with your coins
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:41:52
It’s safe but slow.. if you can hold off transfer for a couple of days it’s best!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:09:32
Don’t understand it myself , what’s wrong with using PayPal with no fees for family and friends lol 
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:57:53
Maybe dumping is the wrong word but when you throw something away or out it’s called dumping so I still stand by my word. It may not be a big dump but they are doing it
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:20:09
I bought £100 more in the dip last week and I’m up £27, it won’t be life changing but it will make more than in the bank 
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:34:55
Yeah if it doesn't get confirmed you get the funds back into your wallet
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:05:51
It’s not that I don’t trust myself or Coinbase it’s the easy of being able to sell and buy and seeing my wallet increase where if I have a hard one wallet what’s the deal? I guess I need to research it more 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:42:20
I have a link if you want to get £7.00 if you sign up via my coin base link? Saves you on the fees
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:11:36
Don’t worry guys I’m still keeping my bitcoin but it’s the truth, bitcoin will be over taken 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:48:12
Nice idea.. The designs are endless but I thought a something less in your face
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:12:21
Happening too often 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:26:05
I use coinbase, easy navigation, good quick charts, easy verification, pay by debit / credit cards instantly. I have link and you can get $10.00 free (so basically pay no fees on your first $100)
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:23:08
How much you looking to buy ?
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:04:15
Wasting your time putting £20 in 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:08:49
Trust you are wasting your time on £20, put £20 into another coin and hope for the best
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:11:56
Do some research kid, google is your friend 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:12:21
Ahh see i never had the problem as all my family and friends use PayPal so didn’t know some countries don’t have it
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:08:24
Says the Russian 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:10:20
Such a technology shouldn’t be under attack in the first place? Does under attack actually mean that bit coin is finally being identified as not the best crypto ?
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:31:52
As much as you are willing to lose, depending on what money you have to play with anything £100 + is ok
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:28:47
Thats that idea out the window!
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:45:25
Can I send from bittrex to GDAX to my coin base account for free ?
