IMHO this rendition is simply too close to the symbol for the US Dollar. The Satoshi symbol is new and most people's first instinct, Ithink would be to interpret that as a written $.

At this point in time and until mid-year, the primary fundamental influencing USD price will be the ongoing Brexit chaos, which had, has, and will continue to have a detrimental effect on GBP exchange rates.
Depending on how one calculates the economic participation of a country in a super-national conglomerate like the EU, the UK is the second or third (or by some measures fourth) most active participant in the European Union's economy.
Obviously, the sudden disappearance of roughly one-third of the European Union's economic power will have a profound effect on the EU's currency. The UK never adopted the Euro.
Regarding the strength of the US Dollar, I would have to say that this is more apparent than real and the result of fundamental weakness and uncertainty of the two main USD trading pairs - GBP and EUR.

Bitpay is a completely ridiculous scam. In addition to charging exorbitant fees, you give up all pretense of anonymity when using this "service". If you want to be screwed on transfers AND database your spending habits for later resale by the same company, just stick with PayPal. They've been around longer and know the ropes better.
I was horrified to find that Wikipedia actually uses Bitpay for donations, rather than just posting a Bitcoin address.
The philosophy of this company runs so contrary to the founding principles of virtual currencies that I believe any company using Bitpay SHOULD be boycotted.

It is very sad that South Africa, having seen the effects of breaking up large, immensely productive farms into small, non-viable ones by one of its nearest neighbours would choose to follow the same path.

I did not find a quick way to do what you propose, but admittedly, I did not look very hard, either.
Since you are using a new computer and an OS that is undoubtedly not exactly the same, I would not recommend trying to transfer wallet files from one machine to the another. Even if the machines and OS were identical, I still would not do it.
Why not just create a new Electrum installation and transfer your coins, addresses, and contacts from the old machine? This would seem a much safer plan to me.

The federal government has powers in the event of financial crises to limit transactions, including closing banks to prevent withdrawals. This happened in the United States in 1933. Greece ended restrictions that had been in place for three years late last year. 
I'd think it very unlikely that a "viral" withdrawal movement would gain much traction.

Basically, once you've given your US Bankcard details or your PayPal account address, you've unmasked any hope of anonymising the transaction and given up all information on a standard government-issued ID.
Is the trouble that you don't have an ID or that the details on it don't exactly match those on your PayPal or Bankcard?
You can find sellers on localbitcoins who do not require ID, but the exchange rate for what you are proposing (PayPal, especially) would be extremely unfavourable to you because the risk to those sellers is very high.

The last post in the thread indicates you are in the US.
1.) You've said that you have the location and funding sorted, so I'm taking you at your word on that.
2.) You understand that you have to pay Federal and state taxes on any profit made by this venture, right? Even though Bitcoin isn't really money per various US government agencies, the profits made are income for IRS purposes.
3.) You should consider incorporating in a low-corporate and sales-tax state - Delaware would be a good choice, mainly because of the above and because it is so easy to set up and maintain. As one commentor noted, this is a risky business and if you set it up in your own name, you are personally responsible for any losses.
4.) I doubt that you could get insurance of any kind (theft,fire, etc.) on a venture like this at an affordable price, but if you can, it would make sense to do so. 
5.) As a commentor noted, these markets can be very volatile and you cannot expect to fund your ATM on an "as needed" basis through exchanges. So, you should acquire all of the Bitcoin you expect to sell in the first year at a low price - XBT/USD is quite low at present. 
You could also consider funding with a "stable-coin" tethered to the US Dollar. This eliminates much of your profit potential due to price fluctuation, but also shields you from enormous drops in XBT/USD and decreases the amount of XBT required up-front to fund your enterprise. 
6.) As this is really a convenience operation with perhaps an element of anonymity and would be expected to comprise mainly of low-volume purchases, you can charge very high fees for the service you provide: 20%-25% over the prevailing mid-market rate would not be unreasonable. You can also add a minimum $10 purchase.
Whatever happens, best of luck!
You also mentioned that your city is the only major city in your state which does not have a Bitcoin ATM. That suggests the market is saturated and you're unlikely to become the major operator of Bitcoin ATM's in your area. As your location is highly trafficked and presumably stable, you could also just get the operation set up and running and sell all rights to the predominant servicer of Bitcoin ATM's in your area. This could net you a ten-fold (or more) profit very fast and avoid lots of headaches for you.

I wondered how I attracted that comment....
I'm neither blind nor trying to sell any coins here.
***You're the nutty Bitcovangelist who writes insulting and derogatory comments in reply to any post or poster who recognises that Bitcoin is not the only virtual currency in circulation.***
Just under half of virtual currency volume is not Bitcoin, so it would seem reasonable to select a wallet which can accommodate other currencies.
If you have some time when not searching for comments which acknowledge the existence of virtual currencies aside from Bitcoin, you might scroll down and read where  u/igadjeed asked for the source-code for Atomic Wallet. You could flame, threaten, or otherwise abuse that poster for showing what you deem to be an inappropriate and deviant interest in a virtual currency wallet which makes provision for other than Bitcoin.

Why Switzerland and Dukascopy? Bitstamp is Luxembourg. Switzerland is part of the SEPA, but not of the EU and uses a different currency from most EU Member States. Fiat transactions should be relatively fast, but Dukascopy's currency exchange rates are going to offset that.
Wouldn't it make more sense to go with A crypto-friendly bank in the EU which uses Euro as its native currency? There are many of those from which to choose.

Yesterday the news was Russia "was considering" investing 470 BILLION USD in Bitcoin. That rumour was most likely false, since it exceeds the market cap by 7500%.
Nevertheless, Russia is by no means stupid. It will take whatever measures it sees as necessary to minimise the effect of any sanctions imposed. A USD10B purchase of Bitcoin seems trivial in comparison to what it COULD do and the amount actually sounds on the low side to me.
In addition, Russia can use countersanctions against US allies if things get ugly. Russia now supplies 60% of energy consumed in the EU - arguably the United States' largest and most important ally when viewed collectively. It could be a very cold Winter in Europe. 
Do we really want to start a game of chicken with Russia for "election meddling" which, after Sunday Night Football and outright regime change, is America's own favourite pass-time? If Russia was able to meddle in US elections, wouldn't that be the United States' fault? Perhaps devoting a small fraction of the computing power the US uses to monitor its own citizens' activities would have made any purported election tampering impossible.  
The poisoning of Sergei Skripal is a UK issue and the UK has already charged Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, absent any proof, in the poisoning of a former spy with a chemical whose formula is available on Wikipedia.

Yes. Your private key should access a blockchain recorded address no matter the wallet manufacturer or exchange. The exchanges and wallet manufacturers are constrained to blockchain protocols. If it did not work this way, it would be a case of the proverbial tail wagging the dog.

I've found you a website to tell you how to say, "I'm F\*\*ked" in 37 languages...
Seriously, a couple of things come to mind:
1. Often a mnemonic, which is oddly named because it's not at all memorable, is generated. It will be a string of 8-15 English dictionary words. This is a representation of your private key.
2. Depending on your OS, you might have the keys stored on your computer. This would most likely be true if you are using a "desktop" wallet.
3. If you are on an exchange, it is possible that your exchange actually has the keys. In this case, you just need to prove ownership of funds - which can be difficult or easy.
A bit more info about the specifics of your situation would be helpful.

Atomic Wallet on Linux is completely stable and supports essentially all currencies, even allowing you to add ones which it does not yet have. You can test it on your desktop - it's available for all major desktop Operating Systems. Atomic appears to have all of the features you've listed, but it's always a bonus to check that it is to your satisfaction before you get used to it.
Unfortunately, there is no public Android version, but you can sign up for the public Android alpha here:
 Look under "Mobile Atomic Wallet" about mid-way down.

That local ATM is going to have a nice camera to take your picture just as it sends an SMS to the phone which might or might not be registered in your name, all of which will be time-stamped.
I can't see that you're keeping anything terribly private, but you are paying an extra 8% on top of what is probably already a bad exchange rate for convenience.

If you are more interested in the fiat markets with a view to making money, while using Bitcoin as a safe haven, would it not make more sense to short GBP, and to a lesser extent EUR against USD during the next 2 quarters?

If you still have access to the old wallet, use the "export private keys" function, or just print out your details and make "paper wallets". Then you should be good to go with any Bitcoin wallet you choose.
Since you are using bitcoin only, inability to transfer between wallets would be analogous to not being able to transfer dollars from your Chase Bank account to your new account at Bank of America.

It's called Petro and it's very bizarre. I tried to buy some about 6 months ago and could not because I am not Venezuelan.
It's government-backed to the point of being electronic fiat.

So, you're right. It doesn't make a lot of sense. People seem to be using it mainly to get what money they have OUT of the country.

Probably it's not a virus as such, but malware (you said you installed it in an app for your phone). Mining malware does just as the name implies - it turns your device into a zombie and then uses your small computing power to mine coins. This sort of malware has been around for years. Your homepage might also have been changed to "crypto-news.space".
As long as your passphrases and private keys are not on the device or are on the device in a hashed form requiring you to input a password to access your wallet, I don't think you're in any danger.
If a virus has access to your private keys on a exchange or for any wallet, it could open that wallet and transfer any funds out. I have not heard of this being automated for mass distribution - there are many wallets out there. Most have little or nothing in them, and the virus would have to be made for a particular operating system, and perhaps for a particular wallet. It's a lot of trouble.
The hacker attacks you read about are real-time attacks on wallets known to carry a lot of money, e.g. an exchange.
Virus and malware cannot change the public ledger of transactions you've made, but a concerted effort to establish a false consensus chain can replace the genuine blockchain ledger once the false chain becomes longer than the genuine chain. This is called a 51% attack.
**If you believe your funds are in danger, you should**


















**If you really believe your wallet has been compromised, it is no good to you anymore. You will have to generate a new one.**
