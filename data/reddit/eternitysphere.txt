Damn really?  Guess I got lucky that I got in when I did a few days ago.  They were having some issues last night and had some maintenance, maybe try again.

Gold has always been the closest in terms of a worldwide currency, but even with gold you had governments print funds using different amounts and purities of gold in their own currency.

This is massive news if true.
Edit - Yeah I'm finding out this is clickbait.

The author of this diary was well versed with a wise head on their shoulders.  Would absolutely love to read the entire thing.
They were ahead of their time so much so they're still ahead of our time.

Happens every time I buy too.  Try to hold til I feel it's bottomed out, buy, then within a few days...drop.
Bought some recently at the 10k mark expecting it to bounce back towards the 14k mark, but dropped, then bought again at the 8k mark, and here we are today.
On the upside, bought almost a full BTC around the 3.5k mark, so I can't complain to much.

My main comparison was more relatable to when gold was physically used as money ($20, $10, etc gold coins).  Of course that ended after the gold standard was removed (huge mistake btw).
I was talking in terms of one currency that was used as physical currency and comparing it to it's value today.  BTC is still in the young era of adoption but it stands to reason it could follow a somewhat similar path as gold, in terms of value growth and usage, etc.  If you could go back 100-150 years and tell people it's value, they'd say you were crazy.  The same can hold true for BTC.
Gold having use outside of currency is equal and comparable to blockchain being used for contracts or inventory keeping, etc.

It is very clear that once you also read through the unedited interview he always skips questions that would lead him into deadends.  He's absolutely delusional and making an attempt to cash in on the satoshi name with the hope that the original satoshi (or group) are either dead or will keep their silence.
There's already a mountain a proof to support he's making much of his claims up with doctored documents.  He could easily prove he's satoshi with a signed encryption message, but he wont because he cant.

I'm really just more perturbed that I held out expecting a somewhat healthy correction and it has cost me about 1.3 BTC by doing so.  I tend to be a bit more on the patient side when moving in and out of positions rather then reactive at every little up or down turn.
This bit of patience cost me a chunk of potential.

Hell of a jump just now.  Nice to see some vertical action.
Edit - Jumped another $200 as I typed this....wheeeeeee!

I'm personally against keeping secrets in relationships, but in a case like this as you have described, I would consider this a good case scenario for when keeping this information private can be healthy.  In your case, I would think of it as a flexible emergency fund.  An emergency fund that you can dip into outside of emergency fund criteria on occasion, otherwise treat it as an emergency fund as much as possible, the main criteria being...."out of sight, out of mind".  In other words, when considering all financial issues, it shouldn't be included as part of the discussion.  
If your wife knows of it, this can potentially cause so many problems and arguments.  Yes, if a divorce were to occur, she is titled to those assets.
Just my opinion, and I generally don't believe in secrets in a relationship, but money has a tendency to cause more problems then cure.

How exactly is it FOMO?  It's healthy and normal for things to go up and down in value.  I trade into and out of BTC in order to increase my overall BTC holdings.  
When it hasn't pulled back at all over a long period of time and there is no opportunity to move into and out of the asset, it's unhealthy.  Read the post next time before meme'ing.

It was nothing more then a stunt by the CW camp in order to spin the narrative that he is Satoshi, which is 101% bullshit.  He is NOT Satoshi.
Also, Craig, if you read this....PLEASE sue me.  You are NOT Satoshi.  There, I said it again.

You could make the exact same argument about gold.  A $20 gold piece has almost an oz of gold in it.  $20 today literally buys you a sliver (less than half a gram in fact) of gold.
Of course I'm simplifying it by not including inflation, etc., before someone else chimes in about that, but it's basically the same argument.

It's not like China ever had any reasonable chance of stopping this, let's be real here.  They are huge fanatics about trying to control their citizens.  By coming out and saying this they are just saving face rather then trying to control something they know is all but impossible.

As a person with a little experience using both, I found crips bills to be the better option as you can roll them tighter and are the perfect length.
Personal preference though....damnit, there's that craving again.

You know I hadn't even considered other countries notes.  I bet Columbian notes would really set the mood!

All we can do is hope it sparks some interest in older viewers (a large part of their audience) to look into it or start bugging their various investment channels about it.  There's a lot of 'dead' money floating around that may push into the market.
We'll see what the show's impact truly had this week if any.  I wouldn't hold my breath for any kind of major market movement tomorrow (but anything could happen), but in a few days to a week we could possibly see something as new interests move funds around or make arrangements to invest.
Anything possible.  At least it wasn't a negative/FUD segment as I had initially been concerned about and more of a neutral topic.  That's a good sign, and it will also remind viewers that "hey, that bitcoin thing is still around" so the aura of "fad" will wear away and be taken more seriously.
We'll see what this week brings.

It seems they are going to be focusing more towards a neutral - negative side.  Honestly though, any news is good news, it will just spread awareness out more as people research, look into, and/or debunk any misinformation in their report.

That's why I specifically mentioned crisp new bills.  I would never think of using used bills for obvious contamination issues, but the super clean crisp 100's I get from my bank.  Fairly easy to spot the fresh from the mint bills due to their clinginess and that you're getting them in sequential order from the teller.
There are some occasions where I'll get anywhere from a few hundred to a few gran from the bank and the brand new ones stick out like a sore nose.
Those are the ones I stick back for "hobby useage".  It's also amazing how great those fresh bills keep their shape.  I just found their overall length and that I roll them up fairly tight, to me they are the perfect length (3-3.5in) and diameter (4-5mm) for "hobby useage".

I was kind of hoping it would be more of a supportive piece but 60 Minutes has always been a show about the dangers or negatives of issues, doesn't surprise me.

We won't see a lot of movement on Sunday night.  The next day, Monday, it's possible we will likely see some positive movement as the episode will remind people about Bitcoin and it will surely stir some interest.
Obviously, Monday, banks are open, money transfers, etc.
