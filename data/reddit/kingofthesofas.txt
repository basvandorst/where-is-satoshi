I would love to know more about the methodology here. Also I am using btguard because it had a high rating in another list but this list is making me reconsider that.

Someone needs to start running buy bitcoin collectible coins ads on Fox News for old people to see just like those gold collectible coins.

Other people have said it but Mark Karpelès getting what he deserves is a favorite moment of mine
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:46:58
yeah I thought about that too after I posted. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 21:38:37
everyone on this sub should go today and make a bitcoin payment just to make a statement. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 14:22:23
I just want to know what he did with scooby-doo
@_date: 2014-03-11 18:13:06
well at least it looks like no one has taken the bait yet 
@_date: 2014-01-09 14:44:14
thanks for the heads up just moved my miners away to another pool. 
@_date: 2014-09-03 14:26:37
well I would take them all ;)

So from my knowledge of doing business over there I have been thinking a lot about how bitcoins could help out a lot. Here are some of my thoughts:
1. A lot of currencies in the Arab world are tied to the dollar in price but the banks over there offer a lot more security then in the US.
2. The current money transfer system I see a lot is Saudi will buy jewelry and then fly over here with it and then present a receipt for it and get most of the value back minus a small fee. 
Bitcoin could thrive there but what it would need first is an exchange in Saudi Arabia or maybe bahrain that would allow some of the major currencies over there to be traded for bitcoins. From there you could get various businesses and such on board. 
I've thought about doing it myself but I do not speak the language and would need someone who could help me get banks on board with it. Anyways PM my if you want to talk more about it. Cheers

That is a really useful way to ignore all the really well thought out rebuffs to everything you said. Let's just ignore all the points he made because of this one thing he said... I think the cognitive dissonance is strong with this one.

The truth = what you decide to believe in spite of evidence. You don't have to care about "winning" an argument, but you should care about learning something new. It's ok to be wrong in fact being wrong means you learned something new so it's not that bad a thing unless you refuse to learn.
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:48:13
/s just in case that is not obvious haha. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 17:20:46
actually according to the guidelines you are more in violation of them then I am. 
"From time to time, we all make mistakes. If you see bad advice given here, please respectfully correct it."
"Keep all comments, questions, disagreements, and advice respectful."
Maybe my advice wasn't the best but I was trying in good faith to help people, personally attacking me and following me around to other subs and comments is not the best way to disagree with me. I never advocated illegal action despite what you say (keep in mind I was the second poster on that post and posted before someone called him out for attempted tax evasion) and several of the OPs on the posts I posted on responded to me favorably. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 16:21:31
Silly me I assumed OP was trying to ask for legal advice to do legal things on and recommended a way that I had done it legally before.
@_date: 2015-09-15 16:01:58
I have used bitcoin to send payments to other people in other currencies this is not tax evasion 
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:15:52
man one of my favorite games as a kid.
@_date: 2015-09-15 15:38:52
The OP was actually nice about it but the comments were way negative, it is sad because large international money transfers are one of the things that bitcoin is really good at.  
@_date: 2016-05-09 23:32:41
I feel like this should be on @_date: 2015-11-09 15:31:36
I feel like the latest xkcd is relevant here

Wow slow clap man slow clap.
@_date: 2016-05-05 17:10:24
I wonder if the real satoshi is out there somewhere having a good laugh whenever someone pretends to be him. Heck he could probably use his bitcoins to communicate in hex if he wanted just to make a point. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:34:49
try kraken or another exchange maybe? Or if you live in a large city localbitcoin is an option.

A SCSI dock is pretty cheap to buy. I recycle servers all the time that have SCSI connectors at work. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 21:53:27
All the time haha
@_date: 2017-06-18 18:41:37
I am just going to say if anyone has this problem I have dealt with it a few times myself and I can probably offer some advice. Feel free to hit me up.
@_date: 2017-06-18 20:29:19
Also whatever you do remember don't copy any files to that drive. Any files copied to it could make it harder to recover. Let me know how it goes :)
@_date: 2017-06-18 20:28:35
If that doesn't work I do know a guy that I trust and have use before in the past for clients (I work in Sr IT) that I can recommend. He charges 300+ dollars but there is no charge if he cannot recover the files. If there is a decent amount of BTC on there it would be worth a shot to try it. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:00:52
Well that is one way to check but another way is to import it to a  wallet. There is also a cool python script I have used before to check it. I will dig up the details on that later if you want it.
Edit: I got to my computer and found the link 
I have used that to help a friend sort through some old wallets without having to wait for a bitcoin wallet to sync up. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 20:25:47
I have personally had good success with this software. Typically you can see the files you recovered before having to pay for it so you can see if it works.
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:23:09
That is correct you need that file as it contains the private keys. The password is just to decrypt the wallet file. Now that being said what happened that made the file get deleted. There are quite a few things that can be done to try and recover it depending on the situation.
@_date: 2017-06-18 21:54:58
Short answer is no mining is something that only people with exspensive specialized hardware can do. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 20:15:39
Have you tried using a data recovery tool and just scanned the whole drive. If you moved a file to the recycle bin it typically is still there but the record for it it gone so a data recovery tool should be able to find it if that is the case. Have you ever used a program like that before? I can send over some links and walk you through it if not.
@_date: 2017-06-19 00:03:42
Seconded on cloning the drive but it is not needed but just a good idea.
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:23:01
I still have my 1 million doge that I bought for around 100 bucks a few years ago
@_date: 2017-06-18 21:52:52
That is a lot of coins to give up on maybe I can help? I have helped some people before in the past.
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:01:21
Yeah if the driver has been put into a raid a written over it is unlikely it can be recovered.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:03:59
that is indeed me from some films I made and worked on in college. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:06:29
I know that it sounds crazy but yes I would give all the money back. Chances are the thief will not sent it back but I thought for the sake of the BTC community I should give it a try. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:37:29
yeah I was surprised it was not stolen by anyone I have been mining for about a year BTC and LTC and it has worked out quite well for me so far.
