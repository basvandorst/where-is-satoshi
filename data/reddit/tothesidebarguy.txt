Your post has been flagged as a redundant question in For your own safety and for the mental well-being of noble netizens, a canned response has been pasted below to address your issue(s).
In the future, remember to check the sidebar for any basic inquiries you may have. The search function can also lead you to previous pertinent discussions. Thank you.
**NEWBIE FAQ:**
**1. MINING** Mining equipment rarely turns a profit. You're far better off investing in bitcoin.  
Most ASIC companies are running scams/shams, including Butterfly Labs and Avalon.
GPU mining is dead. You might mine a few cents over the life of the unit. GPUs can however be used to mine alt coins such as Litecoin. Do not rent hashing power. Do you really think the mining company is benevolently sacrificing profits to let you earn bitcoins?
**2. ARBITRAGE** You are not the first to think of this. Arbitrage generally does not work, or is already being capitalized on by entities with unique banking positions.
**3. PAYPAL AND CREDIT CARDS** No, you cannot purchase bitcoins with paypal or with a credit card. Both of these methods are reversible, unlike bitcoin which is irreversible. You can certainly BUY using paypal, but consider that this may lead to an account closure/lock.
**4. BUYING &amp; SELLING** You can buy and sell locally at localbitcoins.com, however sellers ask for a premium for their troubles. Otherwise, exchanges are a good place to start:
Bitstamp.net (USA and worldwide), Vaultofsatoshi.com (Canada), BTCChina.com (... China), Kraken.com (Europe and worldwide), the list goes on.
There are exchanges for all geographical areas, Google is always a good place to start. Also see [list of exchanges]( but be sure to research an exchange before making any fiat transfers.
**5. BITCOIN AS AN INVESTMENT - "SHOULD I BUY?"** Historically Bitcoin has shown tremendous growth, but past results do not guarantee future successes. Be wary of advice given by strangers on the internet. Nobody can peer into the future and know for certain that Bitcoin is, at any given time, a good investment. 
Bitcoin is NOT a get-rich-quick scheme, and should be considered a high-risk investment due to its volatility. 
As usual the standard investment advice applies: only invest what you can afford to lose.

Mtgox is having serious banking issues, and is rumored to be insolvent. Mtgox withdrawals and deposits can take ages.
BTC-E is located somewhere in the USSR and is rumored to selectively scam depositors. In addition, their deposit methods involve significant friction.
Other exchanges: XYZ exchange will take ABC percentage of your deposit as a fee, so arbitraging may not be possible.

Other exchanges: XYZ exchange will take ABC percentage of your deposit as a fee, so arbitraging may not be possible.
**3. PAYPAL AND CREDIT CARDS** No, you cannot purchase bitcoins with paypal or with a credit card. Both of these methods are reversible, unlike bitcoin which is irreversible. You can certainly BUY using paypal, but consider that this may lead to an account closure/lock.
**4. BUYING &amp; SELLING** You can buy and sell locally at localbitcoins.com, however sellers ask for a premium for their troubles. Otherwise, exchanges are a good place to start:
Coinbase.com (USA), Vaultofsatoshi.com (Canada), BTCChina.com (... China), Kraken.com (various), Mtgox.com (Japan &amp; worldwide), the list goes on.
There are exchanges for all geographical areas, Google is always a good place to start. Also see [list of exchanges]( but be sure to research an exchange before making any fiat transfers.
**5. BITCOIN AS AN INVESTMENT - "SHOULD I BUY?"** Historically Bitcoin has shown tremendous growth, but past results do not guarantee future successes. Be wary of advice given by strangers on the internet. Nobody can peer into the future and know for certain that Bitcoin is, at any given time, a good investment. 
Bitcoin is NOT a get-rich-quick scheme, and should be considered a high-risk investment due to its volatility. 
As usual the standard investment advice applies: only invest what you can afford to lose.

**NEWBIE FAQ:**
**1. MINING** Mining equipment rarely turns a profit. You're far better off investing in bitcoin.  
Most ASIC companies are running scams/shams, including Butterfly Labs and Avalon.
GPU mining is dead. You might mine a few cents over the life of the unit. GPUs can however be used to mine alt coins such as Litecoin. Do not rent hashing power. Do you really think the mining company is benevolently sacrificing profits to let you earn bitcoins?
**2. ARBITRAGE** You are not the first to think of this. Arbitrage generally does not work, or is already being capitalized on by entities with unique banking positions.
Mtgox is having serious banking issues, and is rumored to be insolvent. Mtgox withdrawals and deposits can take ages.
BTC-E is located somewhere in the USSR and is rumored to selectively scam depositors. In addition, their deposit methods involve significant friction.
Other exchanges: XYZ exchange will take ABC percentage of your deposit as a fee, so arbitraging may not be possible.
**3. PAYPAL AND CREDIT CARDS** No, you cannot purchase bitcoins with paypal or with a credit card. Both of these methods are reversible, unlike bitcoin which is irreversible. You can certainly BUY using paypal, but consider that this may lead to an account closure/lock.
**4. BUYING &amp; SELLING** You can buy and sell locally at localbitcoins.com, however sellers ask for a premium for their troubles. Otherwise, exchanges are a good place to start:
USA: Coinbase.com
Canada: vaultofsatoshi.com
There are exchanges for all geographical areas, Google is always a good place to start.
**5. BITCOIN AS AN INVESTMENT - "SHOULD I BUY?"** Historically Bitcoin has shown tremendous growth, but past results do not guarantee future successes. Be wary of advice given by strangers on the internet. Nobody can peer into the future and know for certain that Bitcoin is, at any given time, a good investment. 
Bitcoin is NOT a get-rich-quick scheme, and should be considered a high-risk investment due to its volatility. 
As usual the standard investment advice applies: only invest what you can afford to lose.

**NEWBIE FAQ:**
**1. MINING**
Mining equipment rarely turns a profit. You're far better off investing in bitcoin.  
Most ASIC companies are running scams/shams, including Butterfly Labs and Avalon.
GPU mining is dead. You might mine a few cents over the life of the unit. GPUs can however be used to mine alt coins such as Litecoin.
Do not rent hashing power. Do you really think the mining company is benevolently sacrificing profits to let you earn bitcoins?
**2. ARBITRAGE**
You are not the first to think of this. Arbitrage generally does not work, or is already being capitalized on by entities with unique banking positions.
Mtgox is having serious banking issues, and is rumored to be insolvent. Mtgox withdrawals and deposits can take ages.
BTC-E is located somewhere in the USSR and is rumored to selectively scam depositors. In addition, their deposit methods involve significant friction.
Other exchanges: XYZ exchange will take ABC percentage of your deposit as a fee, so arbitraging may not be possible.
**3. PAYPAL AND CREDIT CARDS**
No, you cannot purchase bitcoins with paypal or with a credit card. Both of these methods are reversible, unlike bitcoin which is irreversible. You can certainly BUY using paypal, but consider that this may lead to an account closure/lock.

**4. BUYING &amp; SELLING** You can buy and sell locally at localbitcoins.com, however sellers ask for a premium for their troubles. Otherwise, exchanges are a good place to start:
USA: Coinbase.com
Canada: vaultofsatoshi.com
There are exchanges for all geographical areas, Google is always a good place to start.
**5. BITCOIN AS AN INVESTMENT - "SHOULD I BUY?"**
Historically Bitcoin has shown tremendous growth, but past results do not guarantee future successes. Be wary of advice given by strangers on the internet. Nobody can peer into the future and know for certain that Bitcoin is, at any given time, a good investment. 
Bitcoin is NOT a get-rich-quick scheme, and should be considered a high-risk investment due to its volatility. 
As usual the standard investment advice applies: only afford what you can afford to lose.
