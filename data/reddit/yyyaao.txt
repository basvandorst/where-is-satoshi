Gavin Andresen wanted pay and control over core development. After draining the funds and failing on the latter, he left for MIT and joined the Altcoin movement.

I'd rather stay with solid arguments.

Let's not forget that The Bitcoin Foundation was the idea of Gavin Andresen.
I'm sure that he is willing to make a substantial donation.

The quality of arguments of the Gavin-cheerleaders is quickly reaching new lows...
@_date: 2015-06-09 00:31:33
Mike is even less trustworthy than Gavin when it comes to preserving Bitcoin's foundation of value: decentralization.
Those who want another Paypal can use the Hearndresen-fork, I'll stay with Bitcoin.

It's interesting to see the extreme level of downvoting on valid arguments against 20 MB blocks...

Well it's nice to see, however I think that time would be better spend in spreading knowledge among users.
Speaking to gov bodies is an overestimation of their importance for Bitcoin. If we have a technically sound, decentralized and privacy-improved Bitcoin, it will succeed even without any government approval.
@_date: 2015-06-16 00:30:43
Exactly. 20MB-block enforcers are spreading unjustified panic regarding a hypothetical and reversible problem.
Thanks theymos for speaking up.
@_date: 2015-06-17 12:27:12
It's highly idiotic to do linear extrapolation of dust transaction volume as we approach the max block size.
@_date: 2015-06-17 12:29:31
No, but the same will be true for 20 MB blocks. $1000-2000 is not much money for someone trying to slow down the network.
Therefore a block size increase alone is simply not a solution. What's needed is fee pressure, to make transaction spam more expensive.
@_date: 2015-06-10 21:18:07
Exactly. It saddens me to see that people don't seem to get this...
@_date: 2015-06-01 18:26:05
Exactly. It's scary to see all these people just running after their leader instead of thinking about the valid arguments that speak against excessive blocksize increases.
@_date: 2015-06-17 12:10:00
Portraying a max block size increase as the only possibility to scale Bitcoin is simply wrong. Apart from that even the vast majority of people that criticize Hearn's proposal agree that there will be some max block size increase in future, they just don't want to increase it excessively to preserve network health.
I get the impression that a lot of people here just want to speed up adoption at any cost, because it increases the value of their holdings. However they do not seem to take into account that a secure and decentralized network is the foundation that gives Bitcoin its value. It's a dicey strategy to push block sizes to the max for quick adoption effects. What we need instead is a sustainable longterm solution that scales well and doesn't waste excessive resources on microtransactions.
In the meantime, it would be wise to follow J.Garzik's well thought-out proposal.

@_date: 2014-04-01 12:37:38
This can't be the case. I've got two payment requests but never used coinbase. The email account which received the payment requests is not old (reg. &lt; 1 year), saw very limited usage in general and was only used on bitcointalk, inputs.io, and was used to try to register at mastercointalk yesterday.
It seems very reasonable to assume that the source of the leak is either bitcointalk, inputs.io or mastercointalk. Where I think inputs.io is the most likely candidate.
(Just registered to post this.)
Edit: Could confirm with a second throwaway e-mail account (used for inputs-io only): Also received two payment requests.
@_date: 2014-11-11 15:23:35
Permissionless innovation can only happen at large scale if there is decentralization and privacy.
Hoping that regulation-friendly nations will drive innovation is naive. In fact innovation will overall be impeded by regulation and restricted to "regulation-friendly" nations. So innovators in not so regulation-friendly countries will encouter serious obstacles.
So Peter is not hung up on decentralization / privacy aspects. He is simply a realist that doesn't want to bet on (or beg for) regulation-friendliness.
@_date: 2015-05-31 18:33:17
Great read. It shows that the urgency that Gavin and Mike put behind an increase in maximum blocksize is unwarranted.
People that think that hell will break loose once we reach the limit are linear thinkers which fail to take into account the dynamic nature of human behavior.
In fact some fee pressure based on a tighter block limit is desirable, because it drives out spam transactions. We do not need the same level of security for a 1 BTC and a 0.001 BTC transaction. Micropayments can safely use any alternative solution being developed based on fee pressure.
@_date: 2015-05-31 18:46:40
I think it's fair to say that urgency is unwarranted from a security viewpoint (-&gt; Bitcoin won't break).
@_date: 2015-05-30 13:13:53
Am I really the only one here who is deeply concerned about the way Gavin is handling this situation? There have been made suggestions to handle the block size increase that are much more likely to get consensus than a 20 MB step function. See the comment of Matt Whitlock at very beginning of the thread where Gavin made his recent announcement:










So there are better solutions (esp. the first one makes much sense to me) than a 20MB step function, yet Gavin pushes for this single solution and when it unsurprisingly fails to get consensus, he threatens to exploit his public visibility to implement an even more extreme block increase scheme.
I don't care if I'm being downvoted: I'm really sick of the Gavin-mania going on here without even thinking about the "solution" offered. That's group-think at its finest.
@_date: 2015-05-31 13:01:03
Thank you for having the courage to speak up against the "Gavin-is-right-let's-do-it!"-cheerleaders. Gavin is not always right and he certainly likes to exert influence (he founded the Bitcoin Foundation).
I think a decision to change the maximum blocksize should only be enacted in consensus of all core devs. It is not wise to rush this decision in an atmosphere of ostensible urgency.
In fact, the fear, uncertainty, and doubt Gavin and Mike instill make me even less inclined to agree to their proposal. All that will happen when the block limit is reached will be an increase in fees - it will not be the end of bitcoin.
Therefore there is enough time to develop a sound and final solution to dynamically adjust the blocksize based on real demand. Also Peter Todd's argument that reaching the maximum blocksize will trigger adjustments in usage is not without merit.
@_date: 2015-08-20 10:04:31
No, it's not!
XT contains other changes that have been previously rejected for Core for good reasons - the most important being IP filtering.
Definitely worth reading: 
@_date: 2015-08-17 14:44:22
You speak my mind, thank you! (No wonder you get downvoted below visibility.)
@_date: 2015-08-17 14:23:49
Important quotes deserve attention.
@_date: 2015-08-16 23:27:20
This violates all logic and is pure arrogance. Keep in mind that Andresen and Hearn are a minority among developers with their half-baked proposal.
The other developers are currently working hard on a sound solution, which simply needs some time.
There is no hurry to raise blocksizes - especially not via a hostile fork attempt which might lead to splitting up Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-27 18:24:21
Yeah, Mike should admit that his hostile fork attempt has failed because it is not attractive.
@_date: 2015-08-24 11:38:16
XTcoin has not yet succeeded in hijacking the Bitcoin blockchain - so by your very own definition, XTcoin is an altcoin.
Since you agree to IP filtering (especially targeting TOR users) you are blindly trusting Mike Hearn to decide who's gonna be able to use XTcoin.
Software is not an independently acting organism like you portray it - it is written by humans - claiming that trusting the persons involved is irrelevant is delusional.
If actions speak louder than words... why are you still posting on r/Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:04:11
That's fine, because is not meant to satisfy religious needs.
@_date: 2015-08-25 11:46:20
BIP100 is a much more reasonable approach than Gavin's untested exponential increase. I support it, especially because it is dynamic and therefore can be adjusted to miners' needs.
@_date: 2015-08-24 10:48:01
Also, both have narcissistic personality traits that make them easy targets for manipulation and facilitates unscrupulous actions.
We can also be certain that a significant part of XTcoin support in this sub is manipulated by paid trolls, because XTcoin support at bitcointalk is significantly lower.

It's very interesting that especially those posts that contain valid information like yours get downvoted immediately...
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:57:08
This sub is manipulated. Take a look at bitcointalk, where the XT-altcoin has much less support.
People supporting the Hearn+Andresen power grab are damaging Bitcoin as a whole. If they succeed there will be a rude awakening - just like with the Bitcoin Foundation.
Bitcoin's most important feature is decentralization, without it, it will be worthless. People who shortsightedly put decentralization at risk for a quick buck through accelerated growth are killing Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-19 12:57:16
Exactly. Most people supporting the Hearndresencoin lack technical knowledge... all they want is a quick buck. They don't care about Bitcoin's future as a free, decentralized network.
@_date: 2015-08-24 12:06:18

Sorry, the very least impression I get from Hearn and Andresen is that they are "whole hearted engineers".
They are both extremely keen on exerting power (see Bitcoin Foundation) and use frequent media appearances as means to that end. That fits the profile of a politician much more than that of an engineer.
@_date: 2015-08-24 10:24:29
The first attempt was via the Bitcoin Foundation. That failed.
The second attempt is a hostile fork.
@_date: 2015-08-24 10:11:13
So you are supporting an altcoin that filters IP addresses, tries to hijack the Bitcoin blockchain and still think that its developers - who are extremely media focused and have shown high interest in talking with various government bodies - are more trustworthy than Bitcoin core developers?
@_date: 2015-08-20 11:32:18
That's what Gavin *thinks* what users want.
In fact, Bitcoin would have never come to life without its properties of a decentralized network, where everybody controls his/her own funds without interference from third parties. *That's* the essence of Bitcoin - not just being a cheaper Paypal.

What are you smoking? Greece is bankrupt. It would be about time to take responsibility for decades of mismanagement and corruption. But of course it's so much easier to blame others.
@_date: 2015-07-14 19:39:47
I did with what you call ad hominem. In fact it's not. The legal status of the Eurogroup is irrelevant in this case, because Greece is a sovereign state. They can leave the Euro at any time and take their fate into their own hands.
But Varoufakis obviously did not want that, because it would mean to actually take some responsibility.
It's not about life and death, it's about taking responsibility. But instead, the Greek government blames others for their own incompetence. Others should pay to finance their corrupt and inefficient socialist dream land.
That's simply impertinent and egoistic.
@_date: 2015-08-16 23:51:18

The best way to kill Bitcoin is splitting it up - that's what Hearn and Andresen are trying to do.
@_date: 2015-08-19 13:10:08
Gavin is abusing his position from day one. The Bitcoin Foundation was his first attempt to gain control over Bitcoin development via politic means. Now that has failed, so he is pushing for XT.
Gavin should not only be removed from the now defunct Bitcoin Foundation, he should also be removed from the Core project altogether.
It's sad to see that so many people fall for the FUD and propaganda Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn are spreading.
@_date: 2015-07-14 19:29:52
Three times simply the truth. Even Varoufakis himself doesn't deny that he is Keynesian, a game theorist, and a socialist.

Which things?
@_date: 2015-04-18 18:56:41
If he's running 0.10 it's most likely the CPU being the bottleneck. I have an older laptop. After using 0.10 I observed ~1 minute periods with maxed-out download rates that are interrupted by longer periods of near-zero network activity but close to 100% CPU usage.
But in a post not long ago, Gavin mentioned significant improvements in that respect for the next version.

An exponential function does not show a linear increase no matter how smoothly the rise may be. If Gavin said this, he lacks basic math skills.
I don't know if I ever encountered a more braindead argument than optical likeability of a curve as an indicator for the quality of a proposed solution. If you follow this "logic" you would have a lot of work to do to smooth mining difficulty increases.

@_date: 2015-09-12 14:34:11
I really hope that more people will start to realize that Gavin Andresen's point of view is incompatible with the idea of a free, decentralized currency.
Gavin supports hierarchies in every possible way: He met highly questionable government entities, tried to influence Bitcoin development via forming a centralized lobbying organization (The Bitcoin Foundation), and ultimately tried being the "benevolent dictator" of a non-consensus Bitcoin fork.
Ask yourselves: Would Satoshi ever have accepted an invitation by the CIA?
Gavin is pro-government and pro-regulation. He represents the exact opposite of the reason why Bitcoin was created (as evident from the first block's message).
@_date: 2015-09-07 20:28:37
Exactly. Apparently the Andresen-cultists can't bear the truth that's why you're being downvoted beyond visibility.

Gavin, the CIA invitee and only person of the development team that constantly tries to exploit his alleged Satoshi-connection for personal PR, is funded by Coinbase. If you read the latest news, you know where this is heading...
@_date: 2015-09-20 14:38:52
"trust/cost/convenience tradeoffs"
That's the key.
It's just a repetition of his corporatist Bitcoin vision, where security and decentralization are (if at all) of secondary relevance. But Hearndresencoiners will surely be impressed, because he threw in some pseudo-scientific explanation totally unrelated to the point he makes.
@_date: 2015-09-08 12:51:05

I did not say: "Ban the use of the tip bot!" I said: "Let the user decide and allow the use of Bitcoin addresses!"

"double landlocked" sounds like a perfect breeding ground ;)

Thank you for the information and restoring!

discussing an issue that you don't care about != trolling

Op says mods deleted it.
If true it doesn't make me feel good about the freedom of expression in this subreddit. (Will not debate about changetip here again &gt;&gt;&gt; see original thread.)

The relevant point is not that changetip can't be useful. The relevant point is that you are forced to use it in this subreddit, even when there is no real benefit (bigger tips).
@_date: 2015-02-21 23:22:37
Ok, now waiting for mods saying that you did... ;)
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:50:19
That's not wrong, but not all tips are that small. I think most individuals are able to decide at their own which scenarios are a relevant use case for changetip.
Why collectively enforce only a single option when we can have two?

Simply using Bitcoin the natural way has nothing to do with fetish. It's ok to use the tip bot, but there's no reason to ban the use of regular Bitcoin addresses.
The only reason to this might be that the mods of this subreddit profit from the tip bot...
@_date: 2015-02-21 17:04:44
Yes, it can be more efficient - but leave this decision to the user. There is no valid reason to ban Bitcoin addresses and enforce the use of a centralized service other than personal profit (check out the list of moderators here).
As a side note: Transaction fees are lower with new Core release and are likely to continue to decrease in future with the max_blocksize increase.
