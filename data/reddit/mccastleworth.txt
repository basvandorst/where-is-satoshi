Would it be easy for people to think of bits like our current monetary units? So, if I see "1.20 uBTC", I would say "One bit 20 sats". It's similar to "One dollar 20 cents".

@ 46:54 "There's a need for cooperation but we don't know who's doing what. So we are proposing to come up with a crypto regulators directory across the globe. But maybe more importantly we need to find out new approaches. Traditional regulation is to do it from above and catch middle men but Bitcoin.. 100 developers, 11,000 nodes. We don't know who they are. We need to find out a way to engage in multi-stake holder approach like telecommunication ministry does. Do in internet governance."

There were talks at the recent IMF seminar about the need to identify all the Bitcoin developers (100) and node operators (11,000) and getting them to work under a global governance model.

Oh yea. I've heard the rumors too – in the locker room, on the playground, around the cafeteria. Kids are talking.

It does. End of debate.
