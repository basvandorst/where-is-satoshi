I’m not scared to die , I’m a little bit scared of what comes after .

Looks like its only for institutional investors.  Cant find any info for the retail side. But still, even if fidelity can convince the big guys that its a secure investment, it could potentially solidify bitcoins place in the market. This is a gateway into players with big money who are probably skeptical as of right now that its still a fad, a small, random event that's going to die out.  A name like fidelity could add serious value. TD ameritrade should be next. Then several others.  BTC trading  side by side with stocks is going to be one wild ride.

how are you purchasing it every week.? super newb question i know im just curious.  I just started with Coinbase and it charges 1.99 each time. Wouldn't it make more sense to do 40 or 50 a month? Or am I using the wrong platform.

I've been digging more into Gemini since your comment and I already like the interface much better.  Think I'm going to go that route next time I have some extra money.

Why would you not recommend coinbase? Again I’m super new to cryptocurrency . I’m looking for long term holding.  Why Gemini over coinbase ? Personal
Preference or is there a legitimate reason you’re saying that ?

I planned on buying some today for the very first time.  I went ahead and did it actually but still.

Dammit. I just started using Gemini. Pulled what I had out of coinbase to make the switch  . Lost a bunch in fees.
