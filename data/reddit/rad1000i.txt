Totally agree.  Dash already implemented some sort of Lightning equivalent and they seem to be more developed to be payment ready.  I don't like the Dash team at all but they have been doing some good development.  I think Lightning is urgently needed.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:20:56
 No it's not. It's lightning. If it's Bitcoin it would need 6 confirmations 10 minutes each.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:15:11
App is software, smartphone is hardware. What's your point?
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:36:25
 They can't send you lightning?
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:01:51
I am just worried that lightning will outperform Bitcoin in its usefulness and there will be no need for Bitcoin anymore. Like how gold is never used as a currency anymore. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:38:00


Exactly because it is not secured like the Bitcoin blockchain. But there is nothing to prevent you from doing it! Ok bear with me until we get to the point then i'll stop.
The downfall of the lightning network is that it is centralized. Imagine a company sets up channels for people to deposit amounts of Bitcoin. This company will operate in the same mentality as the central bank and decide that not all channels are used so they will operate on a mentality of fractional reserves like the central bank does with gold. They thought not all gold is being used so why not issue more paper than gold that is available therefore they will not have to have so much gold yet use the reserve gold to facilitate fiat. They realized that not all people will withdraw their gold at the same time so they can issue more fiat than is equivalent to gold 
Exactly the same thing even easier with lightning channels. With algorithms the company will find channels that are not actively being used, and instead of using fresh Bitcoin channels, will use these "inactive" lightning channels to facilitate movement of lightning? There will not be needed an exact equivalent of lightning to Bitcoin to operate. It will operate on a fractional "channel" system to move around lightning. The company reckons not all channels will be closed at the same time so there will be no risk. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:42:44
 But you would need less and less Bitcoin to operate a saturated lightning network right?
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:13:53
When you "deposit" Bitcoin into lightning you essentially are trading lightning not Bitcoin. Bitcoin is simply an entry point? If someone sends you lightning to your wallet and you don't convert them back into Bitcoin, haven't you pretty much created a system independent of the Bitcoin you deposited in the first place?
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:18:00
 Nothing prevents it from being traded in an exchange. That's exactly what is feared. To become traded above it's real value that is locked into the channel to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:25:58
 Imagine I have a lightning wallet. Why would I need Bitcoin? I can grow and shrink my lightning wallet without the need for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:19:20
It can be used to settle accounts between people. Doesn't that give it value?
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:11:11
Sure debit card is better, and I understand the decentralisation/ centralization point.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:29:58




 Why not?
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:41:12
 Here is where I need help explaining. If i open a channel with A and A has a channel open with B, can't B use the existing channels to pay me using lightning? The channels will inflate without the need of extra open channels based on deposited Bitcoin right?!
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:33:06
 Except that lightning is not a wallet. It converts Bitcoins. Mycelium just holds Bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:43:47
You can't see the similarity?
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:09:11
 Understood. Go on. 
@_date: 2019-08-24 19:34:06
Same here.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:30:39
 Then use Bitcoin to buy things why lock into lightning?
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:52:20
I still don't get it but thanks for your input. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:23:18
 Of course it exists. I use it to settle accounts. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:35:28
 Same exact thing with fiat and gold. Instead of sending a piece of gold it's easier to send a thin paper, therefore fiat created a life of its own a replaced Bitcoin! See the similarity?
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:59:45
 Ok is credit cards and fiat a better analogy than gold and fiat? Credit card is a payment facilitator for fiat. Then again credit card interest is devaluing fiat...
@_date: 2019-06-15 06:22:37
I agree all transaction should be private for it to work.
Will look out for updates.
@_date: 2019-06-15 09:11:49
Sounds good. It's a double edged sword because people with deep pockets will not put money into bitcoin of the privacy of not the which would impede adoption. But I hope it spreads and in due time privacy will be implemented to satisfy both worlds.
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:02:50
Mental health deteriorates? But I know what you mean.
@_date: 2019-06-14 16:37:04
Well I hope this applies too to Bitcoin. It is an incredibly resilient and secure Blockchain it would suck for it to sink due to privacy.
@_date: 2019-06-15 08:29:27
Hopefully the next soft fork will help. Will read up on these technologies. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-06-15 08:42:38
This is brilliant. Thank you so much. He talks about how it's fundamental to implement privacy on the base layer and harness the opportunity before it's too late. He's says in the next 6 months.
@_date: 2019-06-14 16:57:52
I had a read.  It is interesting to know that one is in control of one's privacy. This doesn't get talked about at all!!!!? I have been in Bitcoin since 4 years and no one told me to mind my privacy through bitcoin control.  I will read more about it.  It is so important!  Apparently HD wallets deal with this so that's good but it is important to keep it in mind.
I didn't know that there is a trade off and it would endanger the coin supply's hard cap.  These are important things to be sorted out.
I read about Schnorr before but I did not understand it.  I will try to read about it again but glad that it is important for privacy.  Things look brighter this way.
@_date: 2019-06-14 16:27:41
Not sure how the IP thing works, but the argument with that is that there are cryptocurrencies that already implement privacy on the basic layer which is proper security. Anything on top of Bitcoin's layer 1 is not private enough.
@_date: 2019-06-15 06:23:19
Awesome. Thanks will have a look.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:48:13
All altcoins look like shitcoins today.
@_date: 2019-06-14 15:59:00
Can you explain how it works? A wallet won't solve who currently owns Bitcoin and some people would not want to use it.
@_date: 2019-06-14 16:03:35
I don't understand but I'll read about it. Thank you. But I feel it is not a fundamental solution on the first Blockchain layer. Do you think this solves the confidentiality issue of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-12-15 10:00:29
Ok. Do you think that interest bearing accounts would have a future?
@_date: 2019-12-15 09:53:45
Sounds good. Thank you.
@_date: 2019-12-15 12:30:42
I understand. Thank you, I don't think I'll invest it is too risky.
@_date: 2019-06-23 10:51:00
Where is Lightning? You are going to the MOON.
@_date: 2019-12-15 10:18:05
Got you. Actually YouHODLer states that it has a 1 million dollar insurance fund, which I guess resembles some kind of regulation. So I get the idea how regulation would make this safer and more appealing.
@_date: 2019-12-15 11:28:09
That's a good idea. BTC is very volatile I have no idea what is their policy and the price fluctuates.
@_date: 2019-12-15 12:27:25
Technically that's increase in value but I get your point haha.
@_date: 2019-04-14 18:51:11
This is brilliant. Well done.
@_date: 2019-12-15 10:44:42
Haha yeah that's what I thought.
@_date: 2019-04-03 09:22:55
So you think the bear market is over and whoever bought the 20000 BTC won't dump it soon?
@_date: 2019-04-22 16:07:18
I agree however I doubt I will watch the 1 hour one maybe in my spare time. Nice chatting with you.
@_date: 2019-04-03 13:04:09
Understood, but the thing is that everyone now is excited about the rise in price which is positive but the worry is that this is a single pump and the dump will come crashing.
@_date: 2019-04-22 15:47:29
I'll watch it but it is too narrow minded to think that bitcoin alone can do everything. For starters bitcoin itself has failed to be a medium of exchange. There is minimal mass adoption. It is not confidential.  I cannot see how it could be the sole crypto.
@_date: 2019-04-21 15:08:57
Really nice rendering skills. 3DsMax for modelling and rendering?
@_date: 2019-04-21 15:30:11
Well done. I am not very proficient in rendering so I use Keyshot as it is fast to create good enough renders but nothing beats Vray.
@_date: 2019-04-22 15:15:40
Apart from the obvious that you are a Bitcoin maximalist, how on earth will Bitcoin even with the lightning network cover everyone's needs?
@_date: 2019-12-15 15:47:14
@_date: 2019-12-15 12:21:38
I understand but that way they can't lend to give me interest. But I guess you have a point because they might mishandle the coins.
@_date: 2019-04-03 09:12:46
So does this mean when these people want to sell we will see a crash?
@_date: 2019-04-22 15:45:04
@_date: 2019-04-22 15:56:53
Hence why would the OP take an extreme stance and ridicule all altcoins?  I have no idea for certain how the bitcoin-altcoin field will play out but writing off altcoins altogether doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2019-04-22 15:34:07
Awesome and all the power to you and AA, will watch the video, but still 8 billion people in the world will only choose bitcoin????
@_date: 2019-04-22 16:03:35
Trust me I have no extra information than anyone else. For answers please reread my posts.
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:29:10
Thank you.
@_date: 2019-05-18 20:06:46
Meeting sometime face to face isn't great advise. Especially if you live in a country that prohibits bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:03:09
Bitcoin is tied to the mathematical formula that controls it's scarcity.  This has been put into action since the genesis block and is very difficult to change.  It acts as a rare metal.  This gives it so much value compared to an untethered dollar.  Bitcoin is digital gold like we have never seen in history.
@_date: 2019-05-14 15:25:20
Is it wrong that I teared up watching this :$? Especially that BTC Dip Buyer got me.  We love you dip buyer.
@_date: 2019-05-18 20:13:39
How about forks? Bitcoin will continuously be forked for unlimited supply.
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:13:28
Do you understand crypto?
@_date: 2019-05-24 16:45:39
I agree with everything you said except for switching to Ethereum, but that's for another discussion (I will never ever switch to Ethereum).
I thought that by now Bitcoin would have overcome the hurdles of scaling and would have had a use case but nothing has happened to it.
Also I am understanding now better the argument that there is no one behind Bitcoin.  I mean it is an algorithm that has scarcity built into it (so it is similar to gold) and it's mining difficult increases thus making it behave like a previous metal, but isn't it also controlled by the 6 largest mining farms?  Once the lightning network is up an running decentralization somehow drops significantly and we are back to the spoke and hub paradigm and back to the bank model which will be setup to route transactions.  I am also worried that at some time in the future when the lightning network is functioning well it will delink itself from Bitcoin and become all centralized again, like delinking the dollar from gold.  I am told that this cannot happen but I am skeptical.  
I am actually quite intrigued now who came up with the idea of Bitcoin? This Satoshi Nakamoto who is he/she/them?  Nakamoto is definitely a god who planted the seed of digital gold but who has all the brains to conceive such an amazing phenomenon? Could it be governments secretly working together? Who could it be?
I am still all for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency but I hope that we see use case take off.
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:53:17
The OP is talking about it being not tied to anything.  My response is to that.  Your 3 points, although have a merit, doesn't concern the OP.
@_date: 2019-05-01 16:10:46
What are we seeing here?
@_date: 2019-05-20 17:18:30
If it were me taking your decision I wouldn't wait. That's just me.
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:10:41
If Satoshi Nakamoto comes out at all there will be no more cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2019-05-20 17:16:09
If as you say it is tomorrow then why don't you sell now? Don't you see the market is in red?
