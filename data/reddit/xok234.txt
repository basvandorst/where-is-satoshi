Their point still stands though. Doesn't mean it's not a flaw that can be worked on
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:18:43
Why though?
@_date: 2018-01-18 04:55:09
If that's the case, still no harm in asking them why. Either they respond with reasoning and it can be a learning experience or they don't and it can give people confidence it's unfounded FUD

Bitcoin value would go up with mass segwit implementation, due to lower fees and ease of use as a currency. It's in their best interest long term 
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:09:51
Of course though, a transaction sent from a non-SegWit address to a SegWit address is not a SegWit transaction, and widespread adoption is necessary

I can agree with that, though I find asking simply "Why?" doesn't really take any effort and provides the most insight. I don't try to phrase it as a refutation, just trying to understand them and get inside their head, to see if there's logical reasoning behind what they say, and really all that takes is asking why they think that, it's something people rarely provide in comments here unfortunately.
  
Usually they quickly stop replying though, which leads me to feel they don't believe what they're saying, but they can't convincingly refute it without looking like a troll, and not wanting to go further and risk looking like a troll (seemingly, stealthy trolling, to spread FUD), leads me to feel it's some sort of financially biased or assisted shilling. While sounding tinfoily, to me seems less crazy than people just trolling just because. Maybe I've been reading about too many Russian troll farms and the like.

Time travel still probably required though. I'd look for a post weeping about losing their bitcoins forever, in a house fire or something, time travel to that point in their life get it before it's gone

If this is solved, would Bitcoin be better?
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:31:31


Any examples and why are they better? Thanks
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:23:55
Why do you think it will go down more in Feb?
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:55:17
O rly
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:43:15
Why are these two better? And why has Bitcoin price peaked?

and that beautiful backpack space
@_date: 2016-11-08 02:51:39
Worth a try,

Some past bots I've seen automatically generate a wallet address for you to transfer from yourself
@_date: 2017-09-18 07:21:44
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:26:50
Could you elaborate? Thanks
@_date: 2018-02-16 07:17:54
What does this actually mean for a cryptocurrency? What are the merits of this?
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:03:42
Could you summarise how you are applying the knowledge in the video?   
When you say "if you believe in TA then you'll see what I am talking about", what is it that TA is allowing you to see or what are you talking about? I'll appreciate any answer even if it's part mumbo jumbo.
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:50:43
How so?
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:12:50
True, people you know are gonna know your security questions if you're not careful
@_date: 2017-06-09 07:15:05
@_date: 2017-06-10 02:13:40
Thanks, some good advice there
@_date: 2017-06-09 07:16:20
Yes but why do you personally prefer it?
