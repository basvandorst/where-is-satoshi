I'm very interested in this myself. Here are some projects I've come across that I'm excited about:
 50% premined coins go to population of Iceland
 free P2P softwares for Universal Dividend Currency
 building P2P crypto-currencies based on individuals and Universal Dividend.

One of Bitcoin's main features is that it is not tied to any country.  Unlike with Paypal, I can pay anyone in the world who has a Bitcoin address at any time, I only need their public address. How are you going to handle customers outside of the United States?

I'm not really happy with my previous (and probably last) two purchases from China. My 20$ inflatable ball was pierced after hardly any use and my $350 phone came with a broken touch screen. Not possible to reach either these companies on the phone and they simply ignore my contact requests over email, Ebay, twitter, FB, etc.

To me "children = [os.path.join(dirs[i], f) for f in os.listdir(dirs[i])]" looks more like code than like scifi.

The Bitcoin ATM I used at FOSDEM in Brussels earlier this month doesn't ask for anything but money and a Bitcoin address to send BTC to. I put in 10 euros and I saw the money on my Android wallet appear within a minute. Great experience.

I think Mastercoin is a very interesting development. I'm curious why this link has received 7 downvotes. Any downvoters around who want to leave a comment? (Ideally more sensible than the first comment.)
