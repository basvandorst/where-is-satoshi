True, investors on that site are often pretty gullible or unaware or SOMETHING. Lots of shitty loans get approved. But... based completely on anecdotal and circumstantial evidence (the best kind), I would wager that as many "legitimate" loans get funded as do scam-my ones.

The FDIC is woefully underfunded, IIRC.

Is the distributed network of miners not a physical commodity? Correct me if I am wrong or if you disagree. This is the distinction I assumed most people were making.

People hear "free money" and that is all they need.

Due to bank failures during the 2008/2009 bank crisis, the FDIC fund fell to $0.648 billion by August of 2009. Subsequent bank failures almost bankrupted the FDIC, so it demanded a 3 year pre-payment from banks to shore up its capital.
In using the term underfunded I was not referring to the official $25 billion kept reserved. I was just trying to say that $25 billion is not enough. 
Sorry for the confusion. =)

Crowd sourced p2p loans are fine and can be useful for lots of different people in different situations. 
Cloud mining on the other hand... The old adage, 'if it sounds too good to be true then it probably is' comes to mind.

I am glad you liked it! My secret is the 7th's... I grew up around obscene amounts of jazz, heh.

There is evidence to support the idea; increasing pay only increases productivity to a certain point. After that, increasing pay will actually DECREASE productivity.
