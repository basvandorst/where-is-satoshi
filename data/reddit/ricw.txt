Just like I do now with my bank and debit card?

One at the moment.

I don't think the transaction was broadcast, just mined. 
@_date: 2016-04-26 21:39:41
The miner created it and mined it.

If only you knew what immutability meant you’d be going somewhere.

I had the same experience, my KnCs' CGMiner was reporting 20GH/s less for each board, then I looked at the P2Pool's stats and it reported the correct hash rate.  On the KnC forum we were thinking it's because of the high stale rate in P2Pool, CGMiner gets confused so you really are hashing at 560 on your own P2Pool node.

Ghash.io has no fees but cex.io charges 0.02 for every withdraw, so although you can mitigate fees by withdrawing less often, it's still not completely free.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:13:46
@_date: 2014-01-16 03:41:59
cex.io makes money on the trades which are quite fast if you watch their board.

Rockminer is a Chinese company, and they have proven to ship on time so far. I have an R-Box and it's very good quality (unlike H.F.).

Supposedly fiat withdrawals aren't suspended, but making a request and having it filled, I wonder.

There was talk on r/Bitcoin that Core should implement it if the Classic fork occurs to keep the miners from coming back to Core. Though Wladimir has said he won't merge it so.

I tried the trading for a short time and got about $52 profit, but it's like any other trading just more volatile.

It does not give **immediate** relief. It would take a while for people to switch to a wallet that supports it and move their coins to SegWit addresses.  So how is that **immediate**?
@_date: 2017-01-18 06:19:51
Technically that's a misleading statement. Electrum connects to a server, so you're trusting whoever runs that server to validate the Blockchain. There are several implementations other than core that fully validate but they would have similar problems as you're experiencing with core. And some implementations like btcd are waiting on a PR for CSV support, so if that important to you you have to check. 
@_date: 2017-01-21 19:17:33
F2Pool has publicly stated their server runs an OS version that does NOT have C++11. Whether that's true or not makes no difference. They obviously aren't going to signal SegWit unless it gains a majority.

Got a code reference for this?

One thing is that if you transfer it to your TREZOR right away there is hardly a change in price within a few seconds or minutes, so no real gain or loss to report.
@_date: 2015-08-29 21:39:31
This happens differently right now. SPV mining, when the miner just accepts that the received block is valid and starts a new block with just the header of the last block and  only a coinbase transaction in it. What I call a zero transaction block.
@_date: 2015-08-18 17:26:32
Not really, there are different implementations of the Bitcoin protocol in other languages that are used.

Nobody is using ASICBoost. Nor will they. It's a hat trick that's not worth the effort.
@_date: 2017-04-11 00:04:09
EDIT: (rewrite):
EDIT: so you would need 9 transactions with exactly the same fee to be undetectable

~~Code as proof or GTFO~~
EDIT: I've now seen the article that explains it. 
@_date: 2017-04-11 18:22:57
I can't find (but I will keep looking) the article where Bitmain said the covert method didn't give enough gain for the work needed. Though they are advocating for all miners to use it in the overt method if they patent holders can be convinced to allow open source use.
@_date: 2017-04-11 04:33:54
I hadn't read that when I made that statement. 
@_date: 2017-04-10 21:40:36

@_date: 2017-04-28 22:09:43
It doesn't support BU either.
@_date: 2017-04-10 22:31:50
So it's not as covert as you think. The transactions must be sorted a special way and can be seen.
As far as chips this explains it rather well:
@_date: 2017-04-10 21:33:07
Nobody's using ASICBoost and it's doubtful they ever will. It's a hat trick not worth the effort.
@_date: 2017-04-11 03:32:11
I have read now how that can be done. Though with all of the prep work and the GPUs that would be needed to set up the data I can't see how it's worth it. 
@_date: 2017-04-08 07:13:20
Nobody is using ASICBoost.
@_date: 2017-04-11 06:05:18
If you read Sam Cole's article form the perspective of a chip maker himself, the gain is negligible compared to the effort in relation to other methods of saving like cold climates and other measures.  
@_date: 2017-04-10 21:45:53
Do you have a link for the request? I haven't seen that.
@_date: 2017-04-10 22:03:07
Thanks, I was just reading that. And I agree with him about making it public, but I really don't like "tricks." But if all miners could use it equally and it reduces the amount of energy needed I would be a benefit. Right now there is no evidence on the Blockchain that anyone is using the covert method. And if you made the chips they could only mine that way.
@_date: 2017-09-09 17:27:30
And what cypherpunk principals are those? 
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:20:26
**"the core development team, since they designed the software"**
That's completely incorrect. No one in the current Core team designed **Bitcoin**.

A softfork is sensible? Only if 100% of the nodes change at once. And the difference with a hardfork when everyone changes at once? Nothing.

If you read the job description on their site it doesn’t mention needing any Blockchain experience at all.

She invented credit-default swaps and [their use] nearly destroyed the world economy. EDIT: to be more clear.
@_date: 2015-09-03 04:56:43
At the end of 2007 the est. Gross World Product was $69.3 trillion and the outstanding credit-default swaps total was $62.2 trillion.
@_date: 2015-09-04 04:58:30
In a softfork you run the risk of nodes that are not updated incorrectly verifying the Blockchain silently (P2SH is an example, but everyone did update then). In a hardfork nodes that don't update are on a different Blockchain and it's fairly visible. I am only speaking technologically, not as in our current possible "contentious" hardfork where people would willingly chose a side. That does "break" consensus if two separate blockchains continue.

That PSU is $7,000 each.
@_date: 2017-05-29 07:19:55


Completely false. How many coins do you have waiting in SegWit addresses? Oh right, *none* because you can't move them yet.
@_date: 2016-05-04 01:15:20
A miner or pool controls the block template. So they create the transaction and include in every block template they use until they find a block and it's in the Blockchain. The mempool of broadcast transactions is just a set of transactions that can be included in a block. But a transaction doesn't have to be broadcast if you are a miner with enough power to find a block in a reasonable timeframe. This is also how BTCC offers express transaction processing to its users.

519 actually. I hope they pay you enough....

You are getting this number where? I'm counting them myself from bitnodes.21.co.
@_date: 2017-05-22 06:12:04
Do you have any references to an "initial hard fork SegWit?"

Coinbase uses the Authy API you're keys are not stored like Google Authenticator. But without a second device it makes it more difficult.
