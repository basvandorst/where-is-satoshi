Bitpay is fine, I’m a small blocker myself but bitpay offers services and has a simple user interface that are convenient to most newcomers. 
BRD has a complicated interface and last I heard they’re pushing for their own shitcoin? Breadwallet was great but BRD is a hot mess

You are able to deposit into someone else’s account as long as it’s a business account at Chase.

Download the Bitpay app. This subreddit frowns upon bitpay due to politics but it’s fairly easy to use and reliable. 
Set up a wallet, write down your 12 words and hit “receive” - you’ll have your address

No on all counts except for CPFP. 
Is there an iOS wallet that supports all of those features? I doubt it but if there is I’d consider moving my BTC and switching.

Have you actually used bitpay wallet? I’ve used most of the iOS offerings and bitpay is actually top notch compared to the alternatives. You hold your own keys and have the ability to set a custom fee. You can order a debit card to cash out instantly and spend wherever Visa is accepted. Not only that, you can also purchase gift cards directly on the app. You can’t name another wallet that offers these services. 
Your response is purely political - had bitpay not supported the NYA they’d have a better standing on this subreddit.

I deleted my main account a few months back, this is my oldest account. My word is good.
