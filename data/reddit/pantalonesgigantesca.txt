38, And it pains me to watch all these lame accusations of greed, carelessness, etc. on behalf of us holding there. The reality is I don't day trade, I just had coins in a few different places and intended to just leave them for a while.
Well thanks for starting the support group thread. My 38 pale in comparison to what I'm reading here, and you have my sympathy.

Your lack of adequate customer support and poor messaging on the product leads customers to their own conclusions. This is a problem you have created and thoughtful customer service would seek to learn from it.

Seconded, customer service is nonexistent, they don't answer their phone and tell you to use the form on their site, which just routes you to email. Unacceptable customer service.

Edit: 12:56 PM PST: Still not in my account, still in limbo, waiting confirmation on BTC-E
Just showed up in btc-e about a minute ago as an uncommitted transaction. When it is complete I will confirm. But you gotta admit I shouldn't have to make a stink publicly to get customer service. This whole situation should be a serious learning experience for you guys. I look forward to the blog post :).    
I think what might help you in the future could be a combination of the following:
* engineering driven queue and ticketing system for users
* public backlog status and turnaround time
* clear and transparent publication of queue adherence and resolution (e.g., a realtime public list of order numbers in support queue and resolution), kind of like when you go to a restaurant and put your name on the list, you expect to be seated before the next party, unless your situation is more complicated (e.g., 12 people and a horse)
Thanks. I'll keep refreshing and update when complete

still in limbo. Do you need to do anything on your end?
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:05:37
I've posted my user ID in three different places you intend to triage for PR purposes and you've done nothing with it.

I'll update my post when the money is in my account. It is still in btc-e limbo (confirmation) right now. But I'm good to my word and will update the second I see my balance change.

Thanks. I will update the thread when the btc transfer passes confirmation. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:06:55
Processed plus refund for delay and I'll remove negative comments.

That's the same one you've been ignoring on twitter

What a load of shit. 
This is the exact same thing they are doing in the bitcoin talk forums. Step 1: post your order ID. Step 2: get ignored and watch your issue get bumped unless you hound a cs rep who apparently solely exists to post on forums all day. Step 3: get berated by the CEO for being impatient about your stolen money.
Edit: three hours later, still no $ in my account.
Edit 2: five hours later, after a day of hounding their CS in forums and making a stink in a reddit thread, I have my BTC. Thank you Charlie for personally delivering on the value proposition your service states on its home screen. While I appreciate your effort I won't be moving my $ through bitinstant again until I read the postmortem and resolution to this week's problems on your blog. I wish you guys the best and hope you succeed.
