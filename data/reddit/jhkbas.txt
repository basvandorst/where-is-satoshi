Please stop referencing yourself as "blockchain". 
You're not a core part of the bitcoin network, you're just cashing in on user's confusion. 
"Blockchain.info" is more acceptable, though still not ideal.

I only made an account to comment on them using "blockchain" to talk about their company, which is when I encountered a strange account defending them.

Coinbase.com haven't been observed using a shill account, so they've got that going for them.

Key posts (though every other one is promoting blockchain.info):
* ["Blockchain is an amazing service"]( 
* ["These blockchain.info changes lately, so good" (GIF of a man being blown off his chair)](
* [GIF of a baby crying baby when a user wants the BTC that blockchain.info lost back]( 
* [Telling people that coinbase's wallet isn't as safe as they think](
* [Attempts to defend the corporate account when BashCo deletes a misleading post from the company](
Read the rest of the comments this account makes and you'll see what I mean. There's a month of posts, not a single one that isn't related to blockchain.info and how good it is. Some link to obscure parts of blockchain.info, give very specific advice about the behavior of the service, make mention of things only an employee would know or just goes all out in praise where it's not needed. I can't believe this is anything but a sock puppet.

Reminder that blockchain.info is using shill accounts on reddit to promote their product.

You should make it clear that you are speaking on behalf of your company and not just a user. It's imperative that people state their affiliations.
