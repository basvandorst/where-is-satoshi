If you top up more than 25k per year you'll be asked to verify source of funds.. seems like bitcoin gains is maybe an acceptable reason but I'm not sure what proof they will want to see.

Yes, as long as you're willing to spend $100 on electric to get the $50.

Revolut has pretty low limits.. it'll definitely make you go through additional kyc and they might not allow it in the end.. HSBC seems generally quite hostile to btc.. lots of account closures because of bitcoin activity.. not sure about the HK part. I guess you can just try it and have documentation ready for the inevitable kyc check and possible account closure.

Each transaction must spend unspent transaction outputs (utxo). If any of the spent utxos are already spent then it's invalid. Nodes track a list of all available unspent transaction outputs. If your transaction attempts to spend a utxo that isn't on the utxo list then it's invalid. Once a valid transaction is mined into a block the utxos it spent are removed from the utxo list.

Did anyone get their money back from 1broker? Why would this one be any different in the end?

Might be a non p2sh wrapped segwit address.

Maybe people stop relaying or accepting such low fee transactions.. noone is obligated to listen to you, and their only motivation is if you're paying them.. but if others are now offering more then you're not worth listening to.

The article really doesn't explain how the IPO would benefit cryptocurrency.

If you had 1000 instead of 800, coinfloor.co.uk would work.

Not sure. Mycelium can have multiple wallets.. maybe you have a legacy one and a segwit one?

Tbh this actually looks useful. Prices for phone top-up are only 2-6 cents more than using a cc for a 10 to 20 top-up. I'll probably try it out even if I don't end up using it every time.

Imo Gerald cotten never existed and is just an alias of patryn.

He appears to confuse the genesis block with the hal Finney tx. Also a lot of the talk pulls stuff together that doesn't seem related at all.

Probably.. but same thing with hotels

Eh. Just so long as Peter venesses gets nothing I'm prepared to wait.

in the meantime everyone can step to the front by paying slightly more fees. Wouldn't be particularly disruptive.

I'm comparing Vs just buying the top-up using a credit card where the Telco eats all the fees. If I was starting with BTC then yea it's probably the same or cheaper as using an exchange.

Change address?
