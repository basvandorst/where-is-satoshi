I heard the president of bitcoin gets plastic surgery every six months to hide his true identity.

Good article. Terrible user comments.

Big moves. Either there is good news coming and someone in washington wants a slice, or the opposite and people are buying bitcoins to get out of gox before the government seize it.

I know right for free! Wait, was that sarcasm?

This guy should have known better. I still feel sorry for the guy but hopefully more people will be aware after this...

Anyone who knows even a little about bitcoin is aware of this. If you found this out through this article then you have not done enough research on the matter

This is not my opinion but something I have read: some people believe that bitcoin is the new world currency created by the New world order to unify all nations blah blah blah. Also satoshi is anonymous so for all we know it was the illuminati or whoever you want to believe controls the world.

These look awesome. I like the fact they make conversion from fiat to BTC hassel free. I see machines like these as a huge coup for bitcoin. Cant wait to see em around

This is awesome. I heard someone made a proto of one of these at defcon, was waiting for someone to run with it. This is a great idea.
