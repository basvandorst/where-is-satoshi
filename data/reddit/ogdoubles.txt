Nice. I like it.

Yeah, the side bar for has information about "How to mine."  You can also check out if anything.  Regarding your set up, Nvidia cards aren't that great with mining.  AMD cards are much more efficient.  I use a Sapphire HD 7950, good mining card if you decide to get into it.

Sorry, I can't really answer your question, but I can point you to a place that someone can.
for more specific help.

Now no one will know I bought porn!  If they accepted BTC of course.

Congrats on finding a block.

Thanks!  I'm kind of confused on good programming etiquette.  What do you mean "the noise bit in using doubles?"
@_date: 2013-04-26 02:52:20
I assume you are looking to mine bitcoins?

Fascinating post.  I was reading it and was like, wow, finally someone not HYPING the exchange rate.

I know you're a bot...but seriously, the fuck man.  For OP, thank you for taking one for the team.

Simple rule: Buy low, sell high.  [MtGox]( could be the place you want to start.


Turn that 50$ into 500$!  That's my two cents.

     PERCENTFEE 0.006;
and replace the 0.006 in the function with PERCENTFEE?  Sorry for the nativity, I'm not so fluent with C programming.

Tell him not to.  He's better off buying BitCoins if he wants to make a quick buck.  He's gonna be out $2.5k if he tries to hop on mining now.  Real talk.

I'd be so down to buy this with BTC.
