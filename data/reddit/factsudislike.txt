You still have to trust them not to undo a particular transaction. Whether it goes away after that trust is abused isn't up for debate.
@_date: 2014-05-17 16:35:54
Bitcoin has long become a part of the establishment, used for surveillance. And even though it was supposed to be trustless, people inevitably began trusting other people and institutions, making it virtually the same as anything else. Satoshi must have realized that looming development and withdrawn himself.

And what will happen when the block limit (&gt; 7 transactions per second) is reached? Fees will skyrocket, and if the limit is lifted, nodes will centralize even further due to increased technical demands such as bandwith and disk space, which endangers decentralization.

That might work if the fees are on the order of tens of dollars per transactions, but probably not for hundreds or thousands.
The dilemma is that increasing the block size limit will increase the demands on full nodes and thus further centralize the network, while leaving the block size limit will drive up the fees if it gets more popular since it's scarce.

Long way off, the mining reward halves every 4 years.


That is not true unless the block size limit is increased, and that has costs of its own (bandwidth, disk requirements for nodes). If commerce suddenly skyrocketed, then people would be forced to bid up the fees. I wouldn't put it past millionaires and billionaires to use Bitcoin for high value online transactions as a way to achieve 0 counterparty risk and have your $100 fee per transaction.


Yes, but those 25 BTC bought you something, and it's hashrate. If the fees don't replace the block reward subsidy, the security of the network declines in terms of resources required to attack it.

I believe Gavin was in favor of it too, but I don't know about others. We'll see what happens.
By the way, increasing block size has costs of its own that will decrease decentralization for the whole network as nodes become much more costly to maintain. But then again, we don't know what level of decentralization is desirable. In the end, it will be a delicate game theoretical balance between two extrema to find a sweet spot.

I'm not talking about $3, I'd imagine hundreds of dollars for a transaction at least if Bitcoin both becomes popular and the block size limit isn't increased appropriately. Currently we have a default fee of 0.0001 BTC which equates to about 6 US dollar cents currently. Just imagine if Bitcoin actually became economically significant in this world and its usage increased more than a thousandfold (which is not that much, there can be much higher growth). Also, don't forget that we are currently subsidizing miners with a really high inflation rate which will halve every 4 years.
I think it could be worth it for wealthy people to pay since they will do few transactions and they gain the advantage of having 0 counterparty risk while having liquid digital holdings.

The two unknowns make up for 16%, so potentially 47% of hashrate. According to a core dev's [calculator]( that would give you over 87% success rate in double spend attacks. And we haven't even considered hashrate variance.

10,000 is the present count. What do you think the count will be should the block size be increased by a factor of ten thousand, a hundred thousand to accomodate all the transactions if Bitcoin were to grow to one of the largest currencies?

Did you read my post? Raising it would drastically increase the requirements for running a node, and thus decrease decentralization. It's a tradeoff, and that's the essence: Bitcoin cannot be as good as it is today applied to millions or billions of people who actually use because you will have to sacrifice decentralization and/or low fees.

I'm just saying, why would the market be so lopsided? Are the bearish manipulators stronger, or are the bullish ones in on it, or is it simply because the market itself is actually bearish (more supply than demand as a whole)?

It just means that rich people will be able to use the block chain and its properties (due to high fees) while poor people will be forced to use "off-chain transactions" almost exclusively.
@_date: 2014-06-03 14:32:58
Why? It's pretty quick to do a lot of damage if you revert some large transactions before people notice and switch over. Also, don't forget how intelligence agencies operate, it could be a coordinated attack. You could compromise or DDoS other pools at the same time, and have a compromised alternative that everyone is fooled into flocking to once the attack becomes known. That's why having large pools is such a threat, it becomes much easier to do this sort of stuff.
@_date: 2014-07-14 14:05:58

Have you ever thought that perhaps the incentive lies not internally, but externally to the Bitcoin system? Say, perhaps someone would pay 2 pool ops very well to have them conspire and double spend, or maybe extort them. They could also make a big bet on falling Bitcoin prices by shorting or buying put options.

Noone has said otherwise. The point is just that with a coordinated attack, it would probably be too late to undo the fraudulent transactions before the miners switch to honest pools (or solo mine).

Lower variance is good regardless, but it becomes more important when difficulty grows less. If difficulty grows say 50% during the 2016 block retarget period, there will be 9 blocks per hour on average rather than 6, and so every pool will get a bigger piece which decreases variance across the board.
