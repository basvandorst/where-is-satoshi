Well in those two particular cases i do know the following;
- They control a large amount of their coins but it is less than 50%
- They have control over nodes but again less than 50%
- They exert a large amount of influence over the platforms it cannot single handedly change the code
I’m defining “decentralized” in a lot of ways as less than 50% is this wrong?

Thank you for some great explanations, really helps explain some things. I do have a couple follow ups though
I’ve heard of the lightning network a lot in these replies and from my understanding in research, it is simply a way for people to transfer funds back and forth between only two parties on the same “wallet”. Is this correct, or am I misinformed. If I am correct, would a system such as other projects have if being able to send money to any public key instantly be possible on BTC? If not, why don’t those projects have value?
You mention that the big players who could do a 51% attack have greater incentive not to. This makes sense, but the argument i’ve seen against this is that the financial incentive may not be as important as the power that it would give someone to ruin its credibility. This, then would be especially true, if the Chinese government seized these mining farms within the country. Why isn’t that worrisome?
Great explanation on mining pools but I have to again say, what’s to stop a mining pool who can solve 2 blocks in a row from wielding their power?
Finally, in your the last talking point, you make some great points, but don’t hit the original question? Why must BTC be the universal store of value in crypto when something like Tether is less volatile,  more trusted by outsiders, and many see bitcoin, not in relation to how many satoshi they have, but how much USD worth if BTC they have?

Great points re; China, not sure I follow with the point in the lightning network but I am much too under informed to have any kind of discussion about it at this point.

not sure how i’m a “troll” but okay
@_date: 2019-12-14 14:19:28
Seems like i’ve struck a nerve here? Any reason for that?
@_date: 2019-12-14 13:33:00
I do not know the ins and outs of every coins, in fact the only coins i know well are bitcoin, litecoin, zcash, monero, and the ripple and stellar platform. I had no idea about any of this in september, i recently took a university course on blockchain and it has sparked my interest on crypto. I have no reason to troll and you’ll notice i didn’t “shill” any coin. Tried to be as respectful as possible
@_date: 2019-12-14 14:21:29
Genuinely thankful for you’re insight on some things to look for to confirm decentralization. 
I do believe, however that both ripple and stellar meet those guidelines as long as my most coins you mean less than 50% and not more than any other 1 party.

Unlike many others in this thread, this reply was not very helpful and was very much a superiority defence of bitcoin when i never attacked the platform. 
It’s like you didn’t read my post and posted a crypto “fact” sheet to someone who came in here and said what do i invest in that doesn’t know anything about crypto.

I guess my only concern with BTC as a store of value is that why not stablecoins like Tether for that purpose?

Thank you for some great explanations especially with point  
I do have to counter you’re point on the two altcoins I mentioned. Stellar is decentralized as well and ripple is becoming decentralized from my understanding. What I am I missing there? 
Also both stellar and ripple aren’t about the currency but a system on which cryptocurrency can be transferred. Can this be done built on top of bitcoin instead of as separate entities?
@_date: 2019-12-14 14:17:42
this would have been my counter to the previous point as well. it was my understanding that this is how those platforms maintained credibility
@_date: 2019-12-14 13:54:10
Thanks for you’re reply, on particular you’re first reply was very helpful. 
In regards, to the second one, I worded the question terribly, I should have clarified. I do understand mining pools work, but the concern about china is that the government could seize these mining operations. In addition. I don’t mean destroy in the sense it came across, but merely one double spend attack could compromise the trust in the blockchain and do serious damage to perception, no?

Great insight, i did not even realize that my beliefs have much to do with what you just said until you spelled it out. I could care less about another coin trying to copy bitcoin, but it’s both bitcoin, and the altcoins that enable developer value that i’m interested in. ie; Tge Eutherium, Stellar, and Ripple platforms and projects such as brave with the BAT token seem crazy interesting to me.
@_date: 2019-12-14 14:05:20
I think the argument i would counter with on this point is that the projects are based on permissionless blockchain’s (in stellar’s case anyways), and ripple is still decentralized. So in contrast to Visa, these corporations are using open source code to build on top of those platforms and due to the power of these entities I don’t see the platforms being failures
@_date: 2019-12-14 14:15:16
That’s right, they do have reserves, but would the fact that they don’t control over 50% of those reserves and over 50% of computing power make them decentralized by definition? And in stellar’s case, that dev team is set up as a not for profit right? Does that alleviate concerns?

hmm seems like there is a troll here but it’s not me
