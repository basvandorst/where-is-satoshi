what the point, there relatives are going to buy bitcoin with it, they should give red paper wallets instead.

And that premium price doesn't even include Coinbase fee, right?

I do not share your optimism toward trading futures, remember they are basically betting on the price, they are not buying and using bitcoin, just speculating, and when they can legally bet (with leverage) on Bitcoin going down, they can also push the price down since the market is unregulated.
Imho the so called "shitcoins" (I hate your kind tbh) will help my portfolio to grow steadily instead of depending on the mood of some big money traders.
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:14:41
Bitcoin is not a stock, nor a company, and doesn't live in a regulated sphere, but yeah any pro-traders know better I guess. It's not like you guys were visionary when it came to previous crisis.
As for my hate, it's only a reflection of yours toward your so called "shitcoins".
You are here for the money, I'm here for both money and technologies, your kind only damage the economy.

I do not care, it just prove how stupid you can be, it's quite obvious.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:51:39
It will not fade easily, they won't even use Segwit and use the ATH transaction fee to call it *average*, there is a lot of propaganda. It really seems like someone is paying sockpuppets to carry their bullshit.

because they can include more outputs, making average output smaller.

This is the worse quote I've read in a while. Cutting down a tree in winter is way better as that's when you get the less sap inside the wood, which means that wood will attract less bugs when you build something with it.

I'll tell them that some people like to be inefficient.
@_date: 2018-06-05 10:46:43
I said *average* for a reason. The average segwit tx includes several outputs, which overall reduce the charge on the network and increase capacity, and then lower fees.
@_date: 2018-06-27 08:06:04
Yeah quote a rap singer, what a nice comeback, damn right buddy, keep it going.
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:28:31
If you transfered $289M via Bitcoin, you'd have to first convert the dollars in btc, then the other way, costing exchanges fees in the process, and moving the price of Bitcoin with such big transactions.
So an accurate title would be 650 sats (4 $c worth) used to move 48,500BTC ($289M worth).
Sorry to break your bubble but that totally changes the use case.
@_date: 2018-06-01 18:29:57

Don't call me idiot if you're the one who don't get the joke.
Also, don't invest what you can't afford to loose (which you haven't if you didn't sell), don't blame other for your financial decisions, and don't believe everything you read on the internet.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:40:27
Meantime, all that money is used to build decentralized applications for the internet of tomorrow. 
We could extend that somehow, buying Bitcoin to invest in these projects is fighting for internet neutrality.

yeah ripple is supported by Nano.
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:56:30
A spam attack + another coin with same algo rising that could make miners stop mining BTC? C'mon that doesn't happen every day.
Using Segwit + LN and soon AS with other coins is cheap, fast or instant. Wallets just need to adapt to stop making users overpay tx fees and we'll be good for scaling, until at least next x10 userbase.
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:25:36
BTC isn't anonmyous, any fiat cash is.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:23:39
It is. But there's also technologies and products that grow in that bubble, just like Google and Amazon grew in the Dotcom bubble. Most of these products are only paired to Bitcoin, giving it value too. Bitcoin is the index of the blockchain decentralized cryptoeconomy, and it could become the internet 3.0.
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:16:29
So do you think when you local deputy receive a mallet of cash he declares it?
I'm just saying tracking BTC is a lot easier than tracking cash, also it's probably (or will be) valid in a court as there are secure proof in the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:40:54
The defense was quite ok : no panic, holders be holding, people who had an eye on mempool wouldn't transact until the attack is finished, and BTC price resilience would attract the miners quite fast.
That kind of attack is extremely expensive, because you need to actually sustain a SHA-256 coin that can provides more profit to the whole ASIC mining companies.
I strongly agree, VTC is how Bitcoin should be mined, every computer can make a profit while mining, I don't understand how we would let mining power centralize to a point where miners can collude against Bitcoin, and where the users can't mine their coin anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:05:17
Probably around 6-12 sats.
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:24:31
Anonymous like USD cash? Every BTC transaction is public, and you need ID to buy some on every legit platform.
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:28:06
You are deluded to think it would go to zero, it would dip then bounce.
edit: I'm not saying it would never crash for good, but it wouldn't be because of a small reason like "Trump decided Bitcoin is illegal."

Yes, every exchanges applies a KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti money laundering) policies, so you have to give your ID and proof (selfie or videocall) to buy some cryptos on exchanges. 
As for taxes, there are website to calculate what you own, at least for US, usually you pay taxes when you cash out to fiat, as I don't think any government think crypto can replace fiat. I am sure the exchanges cooperate to regulations and verifications when/if needed.

some comment are so funny in this thread

That's the whole problem of this sub, any post mentioning moon or ATH will stay in front for days, while the core node update will barely get enough vote to hit front.
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:02:33
Can the clueless transactions bashing stop? You can send tx for 5-20 sat/b and they are confirmed in ~10 minutes. We got it, tx fees were high and tx were slow to confirm during the spam on the pool, but it's over now. And also LN is working on testnet.

I have to say this guy takes it easy, he realized everything he did wrong, understands why, he lost a ton of money, and doesn't even look pissed. He takes it as it is: a pricey lesson.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:47:11
As another proof of resilience, they released an update during the attack, that would enforce IPbanning some nodes, iirc spamming was involved.

It's called dollar averaging.
Let me do quik mafs :
* Buy $10k at $20k per = 0.5BTC ($20k avg)
* Buy more $10k at $10k per = 1BTC  ($20k per 1.5BTC = $13.3k avg)
* Buy more $10k at $6k per = 1.7BTC ($30k per 3.2BTC = $9.4k avg)
Sounds like the opposite of stupidity.

Usually it's poorly configured wallet, with user selecting "fast transaction".
Each time I send a transaction, I check mempool and usually set 3-10sat/byte depending on the charge.

I used $10k mostly because the thread was about a very big investment, if I used $100, it would be the same logic, but more easy applicable to someone buying with a portion of every paycheck, which also works if the market goes up, as by putting a flat and regular amount of cash, it would still weight the average price down a lot.


You average down your entry price a lot, if you believed in bitcoin when it was $20k, then buying more at $10k and $6k makes a lot of sense, I can't see how this would be a placebo.
Unless of course we're talking about Bitconneeeect or another "not a scam" coin.
