Just look at where it was two weeks ago or even a week ago. It’s definitely been on the rise again and holding steady.

I think for people who are used to it rising and dropping it’s not a huge thing. Price corrections are expected. For others who invested at the ATH seeing it get close to 18/19k is good news for them :)

Bitcoin started rising again over the past few days. So have several altcoins over the last week or so.

My MIL thinks I’m an investing genius. My gains are modest compared to others (105% gain overall in 5 months), but it’s no where near moon money. I’m finding it’s a fun way to spend money that probably would’ve been spent on crap. I’m in 5 different coins, but researching now what to invest into next.

Watching GDAX sell walls is a fun pastime at work during slow moments.

Yep. I bought during the 4200-4400 ATH which promptly dropped due to all the China FUD. Fun times. I just stopped watching it daily for a little while, next thing I know it’s all back up and growing. I’m hoping for a repeat, which seems very likely.

Yep. Crypto has definitely scratched my gamblers itch. Thankfully all coins are up except ADA (slightly down), which I’m going to ride out for quite awhile.

Yeah, I completely agree. My goal is to try and hit 100k before cashing anything out. Gotta get some money for my kids college educations!

As a parent, if I’m in a position to help my children not accrue a massive amount of debt/loans when they are just entering adulthood, why wouldn’t I want to help out? I worked a full-time job starting at 18 and paid for my college education and my wife’s (we married really young). No loans or anything needed. I want to make sure I’m able to help out my children and put them into the best possible scenarios later in life and not have a huge amount of debt hanging over them.
For some people, their moon is buying a car, paying off cc/loan debt, buying cars, etc. Mine? I want to help my family out if the situation plays out over the next several years.

Why is it too late? I kept buying near ATHs and I'm up more than 200%. I only got in 3 months ago.  No need to buy a full coin if you just want to get started or dabble in the market. While I wish I could be hoarding thousands of coins and retire early, I'm happy with my modest gains.
