Bitcoin accepted everywhere. That’s the dream, right?
 
Just like you, we want every merchant to accept Bitcoins and other digital currencies. But the fact is most merchants have been slow to get on board – which is understandable. They’re not clued up about crypto like you, so they’re naturally sceptical about it. And a merchant that starts to accept Bitcoin is still a notable celebration that echoes on the community message boards.
 
We want to change that. The problem is we have a big chicken and egg issue with Bitcoin. Without enough merchants, Bitcoin will struggle to become mainstream. But without mainstream use merchants don’t have enough incentive to accept it. Take NFC contact-less card payments, for example. Three years ago the market was at a standstill at around [£650m]( It has since grown [tenfolds]( and is predicted to reach £17.7 billion next year in the UK alone. This is thanks to a small company called Transport of London, which was one of the first merchants to accept contactless payments, moving us faster towards a cashless society.
 
Plutus solves this problem by circumventing it. Instead of trying to dig a tunnel through the mountain, we’ve built a fast road around it.
 
[Plutus]( uses the existing infrastructure to give you a technology that lets you pay with Bitcoin at credit card (contactless) accepting merchants worldwide, using your Plutus mobile wallet. The store does not need to accept Bitcoin, which makes Plutus a extremely efficient way to spend your digital currencies.
 
We're at the early alpha phase so we wanted to introduce this to the community for your valuable feedback and support.

If you are referring to where the fiat recieved from the trader is moved to then yes its moved to a trust account which funds the prepaid payment card that belongs to you.
The process you suggested requires a user to follow several steps and rely on third party exchanges with your digital currency. Not to mention paying for issuance fee for prepaid cards and the time it takes to come through the post. Plutus removes the friction inolved in this process. Simple signup screen, make small a deposit and wait for the required confirmations before you are able to start spending effortlessly.
If you were to imagine a real life concept then it would be something like giving £10 worth of Bitcoin to a friend or a random person who in return gives you equivalent in cash for you to make in store purchases only.

Yes interesting indeed, altough its not adviced to do so. It is a prepaid card. Just replied regarding this on another [thread]( 
@_date: 2015-11-19 19:50:59
Yes there will be API documentation. Details of its limitations will be available at a later date.

You're welcome.
True! This is something we have been aware of from the beginning. However, it's clear that widespread merchant adoption of Bitcoin hasn't turned out exactly as expected yet. In fact, companies with millions of dollars in funding have contributed to making Bitcoin easier for merchants, but so far it has been a uphill battle even for them. 
The idea behind Plutus was to create convenience for bitcoin users *right away*, especially for those who earn BTC through work, mining, etc. Basically, Plutus makes the payment process as easy as possible.
**Simply deposit a small amount to your phone, and by the time you get to the store you will be able to spend it effortlessly.**

Buyer's account is fully verified and their funds are already secured in escrow at this point. They only receive your bitcoin ones the VCC is funded taking away the risk of loss to any of the parties involved.
@_date: 2015-11-10 23:41:14
True! You can always fill out a lenghty form, send bitcoins to a third party, pay for physical card issuance and then wait for upto 20 days to receieve your card.
**You can simply download the Plutus app, deposit a small amount to your phone, and by the time you get to the store you will be able to spend it effortlessly.**
Yes it seems complicated at first but we really wanted to use the available technology and create a model which takes away the risk of relying on a third party with your Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-10 18:18:12
Well there are few AML guidelines we have to comply with especially for traders buying your bitcoins. But it will only require a simple sign up for user accounts with smaller spending limits.
@_date: 2015-11-19 12:11:07
You are right. 3 confirmations take a while but it will be required as standard. However we will take your suggestion into account (as it's a useful one) and discuss limitations for regular user's with our complaince. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-11-14 19:50:03
Yes precisely. 
Almost all of the merchants who accept Bitcoin, convert it to fiat instantly. Plutus makes it easier for both, the user gets to spend Bitcoin and the merchant receives cash.
@_date: 2015-11-10 20:01:36
They will have to be spent in store. We would recommend users to only deposit what you want to spend.
@_date: 2015-11-13 23:04:57
No because the app can only use your mobile device's built in NFC. If I was to give an analogy, then yes it is kind of like bPay but built inside your smart phone instead of attachment.
@_date: 2015-11-10 20:38:29
Baby steps! We gave a good example of NFC payment being stuck at a standstill before booming to new heights because of London transport. Same can happen with Bitcoin if the technology makes it more common for everyday use. Merchants will follow the trend as they have done in the past. But even if they don't, you can still pay with Bitcoin and NFC, which is why we built Plutus to help the community spend their Bitcoin at any merchant they want instead of having to wait for widespread merchant adoption.

Since Oct 2015 merchants in the US are begining to replace their POS terminals to comply with the [EMV mandate]( these will most likely to be the ones that support NFC.
@_date: 2015-11-19 14:55:50
It will be in the white paper, which will be published later this month.

1. Once you load the BTC they are sold instantaneously and released to the buyer on the DEX network. These coins go straight to the buyers wallet, which he provides during account setup. Plutus doesn't generate any wallets for users, so no HOT/Cold wallet responsibility for the third party, trade happens directly between the two users.
2. Once its converted to fiat the funds are then credited to your virtual contactless payment card, which is generated by Plutus for you to use in store purchases. Not additional time required for price tracking, simply tap and go.
3. If you are a seller, you can not withdraw btc once sent to fill the open trade on the network but as a buyer the btc are received in your offline wallet, which you provided anyway so no reason to worry about withdrawing from a middleman platform. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 16:29:03
It is an incredibly simple, yet powerful process:
The Plutus app displays a bitcoin address provided by a trader on the decentralised exchange. You can send bitcoins to this address directly (we never hold any digital currency).
Traders on our DEX network receive your bitcoins.
In the store, you tap &amp; pay with your mobile phone.
The merchant receives fiat currency (USD, EUR, etc.) directly from the virtual credit card funded by the trader who received your bitcoins.

Those are older Andriod models. There was a recent EMV mandate requiring all payment terminals to have NFC built in, same goes for mobile devices. By 2017 there will be a 70% penetration, Plutus will be accessible to many by then with out need of any add-ons.
@_date: 2015-11-14 20:05:11
Once you make a deposit you will only have to wait for the time it requires for 3 confirmations. You are device is ready as soon as that's done. Just depends on the network.
@_date: 2015-11-11 01:59:47
Oct 2015 [EMV Mandate]( means that merchants will have to replace their old terminals with the new ones, which already have NFC built in. It is predicted to have a global penetration of 70% by 2017. They wil be very common in days to come.

It was a lighthearted response to show the comparison between two different services. Here are some details:
1. You’re given a Bitcoin address, and the app sends your deposit straight to the wallet of the trader who’s buying your digital currency.
2. You then get the equivalent in cash on a virtual credit card so you can make your purchases using your NFC mobile device.
The only time you need to wait for confirmations is when you send your coins to a trader on Plutus's DEX network. Once confirmed the rest of the process is pretty much instantaneous. This is what makes Plutus unique however NFC is a technology which is being used across widerange of services and we like others want to use it for its benefits.
@_date: 2015-11-14 20:03:52
First of all we will recommend users to only deposit what they want to use. The reversal can be added to the app structure but that is something we would want to introduce as a upgrade at a later stage. However if you still pay your bills the old fashioned way by going to the post office then you can simply use the app. This is something we are actually going to test this week. Royal Mail has NFC terminals all over the UK. Video will be posted on [twitter](
@_date: 2015-11-10 23:57:03
Answered! But to simplify even more. The user doesn't have to do any work, you simply;
1. Send bitcoins to address provided by the network. 
2. Trader with funds in escrow receives your coins.
3. Plutus generates you a VCC loaded with your funds. 
Obviously under the hood it works slightly different but still very simple. Details will be in our whitepaper when it's published.
@_date: 2015-11-10 20:20:55
Buyers will be able to register on our website once the service is launched in Q1 2016.
@_date: 2015-11-10 19:32:31
Nothing astronomical, fees will be at the lower region of 1-4%.
@_date: 2015-11-10 18:25:01
Buyer funds are already secured in escrow at this point, which means that funding the card is nearly instantaneous once the exchange is complete.
@_date: 2015-11-10 20:09:32
There will be a small fee for the initial conversion but none for daily use at POS terminals.
@_date: 2015-11-10 17:45:20
Instead of relying on trusting a third party such as an exchange, Plutus follows the philosophy of Bitcoin more closely by connecting you directly with traders who buy your bitcoins in return for funding your contactless card. 
By using its built-in decentralized exchange, Plutus mitigates counterparty risk, improves liquidity, and has numerous other benefits. We wanted to make sure that users did not have to rely on us as a middleman.
@_date: 2015-11-15 01:37:20
Its held by you (the user) in a prepaid virtul payment card registered to your account.
