I would go to a nice dog friendly B&amp;B somewhere in the middle of nowhere, perhaps Pembrokeshire (I am in the UK). Head down on Saturday morning and spend all day on the beach not doing much other than watching my idiot dogs try to heard the sea, check into a nice B&amp;B for about $100 a night, go and find a local local pub or chippy serving kick ass food for very cheap, chill out on the beach on Sunday morning, maybe go for a walk in the fields or something next day then come home Sunday afternoon. Job done, all in for around $200 and very nice too.

I would. Most people wouldnt. Walk down your local high street, to your local supermarkets, your local hardware store, your local car dealers.... They are all trying to sell you stuff, almost none would take BTC. Right now BTC is more like a commodity than it is a currency. It has far more in common with gold than cash. 
Either way, I simply replied to one guy who said BTC is the global currency and called it delusional. Not sure why that statement even needs defending, its obvious.  I'm done. Have a nice evening.

Says it right there. BTC is the global currency. Clearly, its not. Clearly, thats delusional.  The global currency is the currency which big banks use, its the commodities and currencies of international finance. BTC isn't even a blip on the radar when it comes to international currency.  ANyone who thinks that BTC is the global currency is delusional.  I stand by the point.

Lets put this into perspective. This service has been put in place for a very small community (50-100 people) who live in a remote part of Scotland. Way back when, it used to be a full time branch, but times change. The reason that they still open briefly is pretty much for the old people in the community who have no idea how to use telephone banking and internet banking services. These services are available 24/7, but the old folks struggle with it. To help them, the bank opens once a week just for them.
Now, lets compare this service to BitCoin. If these people cannot fathom how to use bog standard telephone and internet banking, how the fuck will they ever work out BTC? There is no BTC branch that will open up for an hour a day! Seriously, you guys need to start taking things into perspective.

@_date: 2014-06-08 10:38:59
This is not hyperbole. This is a potentially legitimate outcome and a valid risk. Hyperbole would be exaggerating, but in this case, the outcome OP states is quite feasible and quite realistic. It is not an exaggeration to state that should a 51% attack happen, a probable outcome is that trust in BTC would be lost and it could kill BTCs hopes of becoming a mainstream currency, and in the process wipe out its value, just as OP said. This is a genuine risk. 
This is not to say that it will happen for certain, and it is not to say that it is the only possible outcome as there are many potential outcomes should a 51% attack hit, truth is no one knows how the market will react. However, a 51% attack is a risk to be seriously considered, as is the potential outcome of it killing BTC as we know it. It is absolutely not hyperbole.

Obviously not, but you assume there will always be demand. There are scenarios where this may not be the case and to ignore the existence of these scenarios is dangerous. 
The general view on this sub is that BTC is, in the longer term, a one way street and its only going up in value and I for one hope this is right as if it is I get paid... but it might not happen, its value and demand could vanish, its possible.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:55:34

Thats one thing it can do. Another thing it can do which is far more improtant is remove peoples faith / trust within the BTC ecosystem, and once that faith / trust goes so does the value. FIAT, Gold, Crypto... makes no difference, something only has value as we all agree it is worth x, and with no trust, there is no value.
Lets say a government decides they want to undermine this magic internet money, its really not that hard.  Or down the line when it gets more established and someone with resources wants to short it, totally possible. Get 50% of the network, abuse it, bye bye value..... Profit. 
@_date: 2016-12-04 16:17:57

@_date: 2016-12-04 23:11:33
I do not really understand the point of these things. Call me a blasphemer, but isnt having something physical that you pass onto someone else basically the same as cash, in which case why not just use cash? Its a neat concept to make me feel like I am living in a Deus EX future, but in practical terms it is extremely niche. I dont really get its purpose. 
@_date: 2019-08-21 15:51:04
The unduplicatable argument always makes me concerned; I just dont buy it. 
Any major government could, if it has the desire to, spin up enough hash power relativity easily to 50% attack the entire network, devaluing and crashing the whole thing overnight.
'Ohhh but that wont happen becasue look how much proecssing they have in China and why would they do that and and and....'.
If it ever got to the point that BTC got anywhere near becoming the world currency many people here want it to be, it would by definition be challenging the strength of the US Dollar and other major currency's, not to mention the financial underpinnings of the entire global economy; this is legitimate threat to national security stuff. 
At that point, should it ever happen, I guarantee you state sponsored 50% attacks will take the whole thing down. Nations literally go to war over the value of their currency, do you think a few trillion on some datacenters is a problem to state level actors to protect the status-quo? I would not be surprised if many of the FiveEyes already have capability to do it tomorrow if they wanted.
The only reason it isnt a problem now is because BTC makes up a tiny fraction of a percent of the economy, it barley even registers in the grander scheme of things. But if it ever gets anywhere near the scale some here anticipate, the whole thing will come crashing down. The nature of a 50% attack, which is ironically designed to protect the network, is the obvious point of failure to bring it down.
@_date: 2019-08-22 08:16:55
The most powerfull supercomputer at the moment cost about $200m USD. In the grander scheme of things, when you put this into the context of national security and military spending, its a rounding error on a spreadsheet. $200m barly even registers at that level.
A single B2 bomber costs about $2b. A single aircraft carrier costs about $4.5b.  F22's are about $150m a pop. The CIA's annual budget is about $24b.
The point is, if the major players on the world stage wanted to totally take over the network, they could. And if BTC ever got even close to threatening the good old US Dollar it would absolutely be considered a national security issue. At that point,  finding the cash needed to do the job is a drop in the ocean when it comes to national security level spending. Not to mention that even outside of a 50% attack, they probably have the means to bring the network down in other ways being as the FiveEyes control just about every bit of traffic on the internet. 
I genuinely would not be surprised if the capability is already there for the global powerhouses to flick a switch and turn the whole thing off tomorrow if they had to.
@_date: 2015-08-14 23:08:45
Hypothetical scenario: As various world economies fail, people start to put their savings into 'internet funny money' as a method to protect their savings in the short-mid term. This has a knock-on effect of impacting the value of the USD and other FIAT currency. It starts to gain more traction, it becomes a concern.  Governments decide that this is a huge risk. Agencies such as the NSA say that it is starting to cause a threat to national security, that it is currency used by terrorist groups and that these groups are behind the devaluing and destabilization of the USD.  An agency such as the NSA is tasked with sorting it out.  They could throw a billion at that overnight if they wanted, and the very next day the value of BTC  is massively undermined potentially forever. Mission accomplished.  America is saved, the dirty terrorists have lost all their 'internet funny money' and the USD goes back up in value. Normal order is restored.
Not saying that this particular scenario will play out, but it is one of many which may seem far fetched but is potentially possible. If you do not think that the powers that be are going through various 'What If' scenarios right now relating to things such as crypto currency getting 'out of control' then you are foolish. To ignore the threat of a 50% attack is foolish. It is a very real threat, and this kind of money to governments is small change compared to the potential consequences in some scenarios.  If anyone knows what the NSA would potentially do, its probably Edward Snowdon. Its all very easy to say that he has no clue what he is talking about, but perhaps he does...
@_date: 2015-08-14 21:40:00
The point is that if a powerfull enough group want to cause massive disruption, they can...and right now it wont even cost that much money. If that group happens to be a government, then its game over for a while at least. Snowdon is bang on the money with this one. People might not like to hear it, but he has a valid point.
@_date: 2015-07-12 14:27:21
No idea, and no one knows despite what the 'experts' on here will tell you.
However, the one thing I will say is that if BTC is to thrive as a currency, then you do not want these random explosions. What you want is a consistency, as thats what a successful currency needs to be. 
@_date: 2015-08-14 21:24:52


Precisely. I think some folk underestimate how little 'millions of dollars per day' really is to those who may wish to bring it down. A single Tomohawk missile is $1.5m, this is nothing in the global scheme of things.
@_date: 2015-07-12 14:51:08
You are absolutely right, and this is the root of the problem with it. To grow, to 'really' grow, it has to increase its value very quickly. But for people to have confidence, it needs to be stable. Its a catch 22. What you want in an ideal world is steady growth and not the peaks and troughs, but thats not going to happen. This is the single biggest issue with BTC in becoming mainstream.

I, like most people, have very little reason to send funds bank-to-bank to China. That said, I buy stuff from Gearbest in China all the time, doesnt cost me a huge amount to transact via PayPal and for what I do pay I get insurance that means when Gearbest give me shitty service I can charge back via PayPal, its insurance to transact.
The point of my post was that the guy said that a money transfer via a bank is not even close in terms of speed, and in most scenarios for me and millions like me thats simply not true. I can transfer via by bank faster than BTC to 99% of the people I would ever transact with.

I am sure someone is, but I am not. And as a consumer, thats what I care about. 
When transferring money from one British bank account to another British bank account belonging to someone else, for both account holders it is free and instant (they say up to 2 hours but in my experience, it has been literally 1 second). Both accounts can be free to hold accounts, ie no monthly fees etc. Thats about as free as it gets. Plus its insured etc.
I am sure that traders or premium account holders or someone somewhere funds it, but to the average person on the street its totally free.
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:47:53
The very fact that someone buying $10m is relevant shows how immature BTC still is. In the world of finance, $10m is nothing.  People jumping up and down about JP Morgan and they are just a broker etc.... this is $10m, its a rounding error on a spread sheet to the big boys. Its nothing.
How this translates to the potentail value of BTC in the future can be interpreted in two ways. The way everyone hopes, its tiny now but its going to be huge..... or the other way, its nothing and will end up vanishing into nothing.  Not trying to be a ney-sayer, but to those of you who are putting in more than you can afford to loose and fully buying into HODL and to the moon and all that, please remember this is still a gamble.

They key to this statement is the word asset. It is still unknown if, over a long period of time, BTC will be viewed as an asset. It could very reasonably end up stabilizing at zero just as it could stabilize significantly higher than it is today. Long story short, it is still a gamble to see if the world at large views BTC as an asset - no one knows.

This really does not fix the fundamental problem. A hardware wallet is akin to a physical safe and hardly anyone puts their monthly wage into a physical safe in their house - its far safer and easier to put it in a bank.

@_date: 2015-02-13 01:53:04
Depends how you measure it.
However, this is a BTC sub-reddit, therefore its convenient to pick and choose only the information that suits the BTC argument. In this case, then its ok to go with saying that sure, bandwidth grows at 50% per year, but conveniently forget that actually, for a huge number of people, they are stuck at close to dial-up speeds, and that as such they cannot use BTC when the blockchain gets so large...but that goes against the wonderful BTC being all inclusive and the solution to the worlds problems, so we can conveniently ignore that side of it. On the one hand we have the BTC world saying its the worlds solution for the third world finance system, yet somehow the third world will magically be able to download 2 HD movies worth of a blockchain from a farm in the middle of Africa 200 miles from the nearest city. It doesnt add up.

If they are so concerned about 2.50, then they will be FAR more concerned about the volatile nature of BTC's price. Fact is, most people will just pay the 2.50, its zero risk for them. Taking payment is BTC is a higher risk than just taking the 2.50.
