Bitcoin is a genius idea for the people who started it but isn't it really just a Ponzi scheme based on the greater fool.
The only selling points is the negative features of fiat money and the ability to transact anonymously but really what value is it to honest people?
I think I'd rather own hard assets like gold if I really want to see future upside.

Wow Very complicated!  I understood money better at 5 than most adults understand bit coins. It's almost like a secret society relying on the greater fool theory but maybe I'm too cynical. 
I understand the basic premise and logic and even why many people might want to use bit coins but here are a few basic questions which may help me better understand why anyone legitimate person would actually buy this digital currency:
1) The maximum outstanding amount is 21 million and the current outstanding is about 70% of that number. How does the number expand and who receives the value of the new coins?
2) The original founders got in for pennies anybody know what they paid and what happened to this money? Wouldn't a fairer system start with giving everybody a set amount spreading the wealth around to all users instead of just the founders?
3) I understand that any large sale of bitcoins, say $10m or more would have a negative impact on the price, how many people hold $10m or more of this currency?
4) The current total value of bitcoins are around $6billion. How many original owners became millionaires from this scheme?
5) How is this any different than a pump and dump stock?
6) What's to stop the founders from changing the rules or starting up competing digital currencies?
7) If all of a sudden there was no buyers of bitcoins, would the value drop to zero?
