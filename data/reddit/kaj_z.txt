What makes a mining operation 'illegal'? Why does it have to be covered by a company to be legal?

I stopped reading OP after the first paragraph with the mistake - thanks for the correction. The financial illiteracy in this community staggers me.

This could have been summarized by just saying 'its a bubble'.

Did you take out any debt to buy? Alternatively, do you have large debts (mortgage, student loan, etc) that you are currently holding?

Did you have a near term selling strategy (eg “sell 10% every time it goes up 20%”) that you were mentally committed to when buying? Or were you planning on holding long term?

Energy 'storage'. 
One way to look at crypto is you are purchasing electricity. Someone in China mined some coin using hydro power a year ago, and I can buy that coin today. I effectively bought energy from a far away place and from the past. The problems in our energy grid have to do with location (getting the power from where its produced to where its needed) and timing (producing the power when its needed, this is especially problematic with renewables). Can crypto solve these problems?
Well the obvious issue is that I can't turn my coin back into energy directly. Currently its a one way battery: energy goes in, but it can't come out. Figuring out how to get the battery to work in reverse is beyond my imagination, but maybe someday someone will crack the puzzle.

In my case it’s because every time I come to this forum with some healthy skepticism or even honest questions, I get flamed for being a troll. That’s the quality of the community in this subreddit (I’ve had real discussions in other Bitcoin/crypto subreddits). And now that the bears have been proven right (at least temporarily) its only natural to give out a bit of salt on here.

So you're saying people should buy low...and sell high?
