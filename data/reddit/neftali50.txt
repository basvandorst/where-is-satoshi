The problem it's just one. We always end centralizing everything. And then we said Bitcoin, banks, politicians, big corporations, etc.. are the problem. Don't give all that power to a central point of failure.

To me wallet it's just simple. No HD, deterministic wallet, keychain, etc. This just complicate more how people understand the technology. Call it just wallet. I prefer that if wallets has some features just called wallet 2.0

To me this is ripple 2.0, they are trying to fix the bad thing in ripple. Like the control that ripple labs has over the total XRP. Stellar is open source, the code it's there you can use it. They're promoting giving away 95% I think and take 5% for the stellar nonprofit foundation for development .. I see this platform adopted by banks, paypal, government and maybe google. This platform has a lot of value for banking institutions because can be adapted easily with regulations and all that political rules. Think about it banks has to change soon to not be affected by this new wave of new tech.. ripple and stellar are the only options for them to adapt in this new crypto currency world the way I see this.

If trump wins!! what I'll do is just simple. First go long very long with BTC and short very short with USD. Next.. I will take my big profits out of the exchange. Then I will take a long 4 years vacation in some Caribbean Island drinking pina colada and watching the Bush part 2 movie now with Trump. Then until the next election that I expect to repeat the process if Trump wins.. but I hope you don't have to waste your time transferring your BTC to our wallets.
