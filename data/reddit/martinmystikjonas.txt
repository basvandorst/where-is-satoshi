It will be slow transition from block reward plus small fee reward throught small block reward plus high fee reward to only fee reward. But the point is that in future bitcoin will process much more transactions (thanks to moore law and blockchain technology improvements) so even with small fee per transaction sum reward for miner will be higher. Also more scare supply mean higher bitcoin value which mean higher miner reward too.

Signing of transactions by private key uses ecdsa assymetric crxptography not sha256 hashing. This is completely different thing.
If you will be able to break ecdsa and get private jey from public address they bitcoin is last thing I would worry about. It will allow you to do anything to almost any computer with remote access (banks, goverment, military,... )

It would require a) remining of all blocks which is very expensive even with quantum computer (it would be impossible if it would be on md5 difficulty level) b) force majority nodes to throw away their blockchain and use your version c) prevent nodes with correct blockchain from switching to different hashing function eliminating you from network. Basically all you can do is confuse new nodes which blockchain version is correct for short time between your attack and hard fork which will switch to different hashing.

Yes but this only allows you to attack few new nodes coming online between your attack and spread of news about that attack. Then all unaffected nodes would switch to new hashing function and continue mining. You could temporarily criple network but not destroy it.

From their locally stored blockchain. Nodes just refuse blocks in conflict with what is already stored locally.

Please explain. How you create private key for gived collision without breaking ecdsa? If you find collision you find only publuc key.

Old transactions are totally unaffected by any future change to signing or PoW mechanisms. Once block is mined and accepted by whole network it becomes irrelevant how trabsactions in it was signed or how PoW was computed.

Yes but that forged new blocks will be immediatelly spotted as invslid because they will be in conflict with tx broadcasted for thst block. This is not really possible attack vector. You would be able to to double spend attack with that power but only for few last blocks. And honest nodes will spot thst attack immediately because it will create new chain in conflict with original stored on all of them.
From strictly technical point it would allow you to double spend but only if you ignore fact that honest nodes could coordinate countermeasures outside protocol.

Well they are not allowed. Simply there is no way to force them not to.
