The potential is surely awesome. Several things are necessary for this to happen though: 
a) market liquidity
b) usability
c) problems of scale (blockchain wise)

Am I misreading the title? Why would I *donate* to a pornstar? 
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:15:48
Because raw multi-sig is not provably prunable (the way OP_Return would have been) - and as far as I've heard there are some security issues as well. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 16:10:58
I think so too - but I didn't make that argument. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 13:17:58


That's not quite correct - you are making it sound like some amount of BTC in one's wallet is actually 'a colored asset'. The data regarding an asset issuance is maintained in the blockchain - because a bitcoin transaction was used to encode it, but it doesn't actually relate to any denominatable amount of bitcoin.

It wouldn't be based on bad harvest. It would be based on scientifically veritable statistics such as rainfall amount, or officially declared drought etc -  edit: I don't think you will find any insurer anywhere that will insure anyone against a "bad harvest"

It's nothing so drastic. Next time you have such plans I'd be happy to offer some informal advice. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 17:05:13
very clever
@_date: 2014-06-21 14:33:20
It wasn't pointing that out as a question of profitability; but I do think it is a question of the rate at which we produce garbage vs. the rate at which we are able to remove it. The cost is an indicator of how highly noneffective this method of removal is. I don't know much of the details, but I'm very skeptical. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 14:18:53
Wow 4.56 Euro per KG of plastic cleaned up!!!! That's several magnitudes above the cost of production.

Economically speaking there are effective and non-effective ways to repair damage. You know this is why sometimes old buildings get renovated whereas in other cases they are torn down and new ones are built. Just because something is a 'good cause' doesn't mean people should throw away their discretion to the effectiveness and capabilities of the proposed solution.  edit: I'm not skeptical about the issue, I'm skeptical about a "supposed solution" with cleanup costs at 4.56EURO per KG.

No need to listen to the guy that ignorantly spues 'Listen to Mike Hearn' 'Bitcoin is a transaction Ledger not an all Purpose Database'.
Since Counterparty is recording transactions in the data - I would suggest time may be better spent for xrandr asking some questions / questioning what he thinks he knows. Instead of trolling people that understand something slightly less than he does. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 19:45:06
That's either very surprising or breach of contract. Most credit card companies agreement's stipulate that merchants cannot discriminate in favor of cash payment as a conditional to being able to process credit cards.

community at large. That might be a secondary role that we’ve acquired
but we set out to represent the industry and individual members. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 16:09:56
You're doing exactly the same thing when you're posting 'Mike Hearn is correct'. 
Only for some reason you also think it's legitimate to point it out about others in an insulting manner. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 12:43:52
Firstly Counterparty data is financial transaction data - it's adding functionality on the Bitcoin blockchain. 
Mike Hearn's suggestion has a lot of problems. 
Quote from Peter Todd: 


@_date: 2014-03-25 15:47:10
You would be able to store the transaction without needing to store the OP_Return data. I don't have much more information about the security issues. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 14:41:30
That example is not effective because no countries economy can afford that, or do you want people to starve, not have access to healthcare, education, etc. just so you can see your favorite goal of cleaning up the ocean come to fruition? 
@_date: 2014-03-25 12:32:12
The essential point this article is missing, that was on-going contention of the Bitcoin talk Forum discussion - is that Counterparty works fine without OP_Return using just Multi-sig, rather it's that the developers who just shreded OP_Return down to 40 bytes, want
Counterparty to stop using Multisig.

I don't think Brutalism is a thing unless you meant [ Also from a legal perspective I do not think 'his debts' and 'his companies debts' are the same thing.
Apparently Mark once promised never to sell the domain - but that's not a legal fact of any sort, a legal fact would be if he were indicted of negligence or fraud and ordered to pay for damages from his own funds.

How about US citizens taxpayer money as a vehicle for terrorist funding? Because how much has the Obama administration contributed to "rebels" in Syria. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 16:26:10
Okay - did you take the time to get Phantomphreaks or another developers opinion on why they aren't doing something like that? 
Or did you decide you have enough expertise (on your own) to recommend what Mike Hearn is suggesting versus the alternatives? 
Would you care to code an implementation as proof of concept? 
@_date: 2014-03-25 13:08:27
The obvious problem with this approach is that the percentage of the community that has a an adequate technical understanding of the issues involved is &lt; 1%

You realize it's a deterministic wallet? all the sensitive information is client side.

Just the right kind of mature, responsible approach for contributions to a protocol with Billions of dollars of users money at risk.

Also I'm working on a side-project on the usability end (the livenet version has a few days to go though).

Good to have things cleared up. I am rather concerned about the future of Bitcoin related Apps on Chrome. 
While It's one thing if someone's bubble trouble, or weather apps are disabled; it's entirely another for apps which people are using to store real funds &amp;or private keys. Is there ever a chance of locally stored data being at a risk of loss? Are there any plans for some official guidelines in this regard?
 
I also think it's a significant concern that Kryptokit developers (as far as I understand) were neither forewarned nor adequately alerted regarding the reasons behind their account suspension. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 03:02:15
This is silly.

I don't really understand the point of delivering a fundamentally inferior solution to a problem that's already been solved.
But the video was good. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 15:47:19
There is absolutely nothing which Colored Coins does that Counterparty doesn't already do. 
And the cost of the inferior solution is very explicitly: that Colored Coins can't realize a real Decentralized exchange. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 17:18:58
And the decentralized exchange part of that is where exactly? Vaporware?

I think it was just a generic message, regarding the account being removed due to ToS violations.
