I think you're missing the point. It's a foolish question that has clearly been suggested to you by someone else. If you don't know much about LN, then you have no basis to believe one thing or another about it.

Ppl like you are so good for this community

Stupid comment gets downvote

Transactions will aggregate between blocks, then be cleared as soon as a new block is mined. That's why you see the sawtooth pattern. The top (highest fee) transactions clear first, so the pool generally clears from highest to lowest fees.

An unpopular opinion but I agree with you.

And who exactly is going to enforce this worldwide? **crickets**

Same reason you don't flash cash at the ATM. Be discreet and keep the incentive to behave badly as low as possible.

Ok, snowflake. I'm not your dad, you'll have to make your own way. My comments were neither appeals to morality nor logic, just common sense and common decency to not endanger others and not risk federal prison.

Dude, DON'T MAIL BOMBS. Hard stop. Not a great point of comparison there either.

So in practice it will slowly increase difficulty?

You're a snowflake because you told me not to tell you what to do, and then followed up with a post that not so subtly affirmed domestic terrorism under the veil of individual liberty. Despicable.

If you chart the best fit line of the Fibonacci numbers in these data into Wolfram Alpha:
    best fit line {2, 138}{3, 76} {5, 69} {8, 38}
Note: I have a numerical hunch about the importance of Fibonacci numbers in BTC.  You will get a resulting logarithmic decay equation of: 
    168.803 - 64.6295log(x)
By this measure (with a pretty solid adjusted R^2 of .80), we'll be seeing 10k in 20 days. After that point this model only seems to function to 13k... then we start getting negative results and I don't have the foggiest idea of what to do with that!

Drugs don't have a risk of exploding in transit and killing federal postal workers. You've got to be kidding me on that comparison.

I'm not a conspiracist, simply against non-competitive ventures that harm end consumers. I'm sure others will take their place. The incentives are too high not to.

You can still accept it. Banning something doesn't get rid of it, it just changes the use cases and economic system surrounding it. The price would likely rise because the entirety of the ecosystem would be pushed underground.

I absolutely understand your sentiment regarding WU. As a business owner myself, I rally entirely behind the capitalist model. However, a monopolistic venture that increases rates is operating in a non-competitive landscape, hardly an example of simply providing a service and charging for it .

Thanks for sharing, watched the whole thing. It's clear the Fed Gov has NO clue what DLT is or how BTC operates in a global economy. Bullish as far as I'm concerned.

I'm excited by these in theory, but has anyone ever actually seen anyone using one?

You better HODL the shit outta it.

How do you move your coins from Coinbase to a ledger wallet?
