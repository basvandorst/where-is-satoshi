I use "Mycelium Bitcoin Wallet" for Android and this is best app ever for me. You can add and remove paper wallets any time you want ! 
IMO this app is extremely save and secure, because you can connect your paper wallet only to 'monitor' BTC amount without adding PrivKey ! Try it yourself !

I use (bitmarket.pl)
It's kind of revolutionary exchange here in Poland. You register in under 5 minutes, then you buy Bitcoins/Litecoins instantly using your credit/debit card or instant money transfer form any Polish bank. Works perfectly for me, and IMO it's the best exchange right now in Poland.

Some of the businesses are not accepting Bitcoins any more. Today I called a bar in Warsaw, listed on Coinmap, they told me that I cannot pay with Bitcoins because they lost charger for tablet (with wallet). Nobody asks for Bitcoin payments so they doesnt care. This is sad :(

Zero... absolutely none ! ... Though, in the begining of April I've spoken with over 50 my friends (and other people I brifely know), tried to ecourage them to invest some money into BTC. 
I told them that we're at the bottom at that time... none, listen to me, some were even very hostile.

Using values like :
0.00052531, 0.00152521, 0.00351132, 0.00752544 ... is so akward and confusing... 
People aren't used to operate on fractions (some of them don't even realise those do exists ! ;) 
We should start using uBTC, as it was proposed, and call it 'Bits' ... so, it would be :
1 Bitcoin = 1.000.000 Bits , 
fee for transaction 0,0001 BTC = 100 Bits
coffee 0,005 BTC = 5000 Bits

What do you think the bottom lowest price ($$) for Bitcoin is ?
IMO if it goes under some price level new people will start buying just for fun of having one (or having more in existing collection).
Many of my friends said that they would try Bitcoin, but it is to expensive... they would get in if it was below 100$... 
At that price level may would sell but most people would hold their Bitcoin, and many new would start buying... so what do you thing the equilibrium is ? 
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:23:05
By my simple rough calculation ... 
max $32  divided by 10 gives $3.20
 
max $1200 divided by 10 gives $120 ... 
... but falling from higher level gives you more velocity, soo... I would say we can reach $80-90... then we set at $100-120 for a quite long time... 
... that is my unprofessional view of the situation :)

I don't want do spend my BTC right now, I'd like to keep it as a long term investment.

If 1 BTC was 20.000$, one satoshi would cost 0.0002$

Right now fees are some kind of joke... I personally stopped using BTC because of high fees.

Having in mind this all 'fork thing' is it safe to buy Bitcoins now and keep them on paperwallets for long term.

This cute baby :
does exactly what you looking for... You need to sweep your paper wallet - scan qr code.

This approach works perfectly for me :)

Is BIP38 encryption safe and secure?... but not in terms that 
somebody can break/guess my password, but in meaning that one day 
I wake up and learn that it is no longer supported 
leaving all my bitcoins on paper wallets encrypted for eternity. 
Is BIP38 encryption proved secure against 'brute force - dictionary'
attack (or any other password breaking attack)? 
Is password type like 'TdIfsB12$iWi%%=52312&amp;Justice4All' safe enough
for BIP38 encrypton ? 
Is string like 'TdIfsB12$iWi%%=52312&amp;Justice4All' is strong enough 
to be used as a 'salt' for brain wallet ?
Im generating my priv keys using bitaddress.org downloaded from GitHub.
I run my laptop from Ubuntu pendrive, then I open .zip archive that 
was downloaded on another PC. 
Is it safe to test those private keys (when I make backups with pen&amp;paper, 
if there is no misspelling of any charakter in priv-key) on a machine 
booted from linux pendrive distribution (no network is connected) ?
Can sometning see my private key typed anyway (trojan or keylogger) and
disclose it to somebody ?
How can I be sure that .zip archive taken from GitHub is genuine, and 
hasn't been tempered by somebody ?
How can I be sure that such bitaddress.org site is not generating private
keys only from specific pool known to somebody ?
ThankU ;)

This is actually very easy to obtain. All what they need to do is to completely ban anonymous internet access. 
No free wifi hot spots, no top-up cell phones without registration. 
Then, if you want to trade bitcoins you need to register your BTC address in tax office. All transactions from/to this address will be monitored and watched with scrutiny. 
One unexplained transaction to unregistered address and you will be called to tax office to make explanations. 
Impossible ? We'll see that soon :/
You will be able of course to buy bitcoins with cash. But then if your ISP detects 'suspicious data movement' it will be obliged to raport it to tax office (or Police). 
And then they ban cash and we are all f**ked !
