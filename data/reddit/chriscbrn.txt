See I’m trying to be optimistic of the world that paints. Where fiat is dead and crypto is the main currency. 
Your explanations work great but the coins still only have value backed by fiat.

Please elaborate on how currencies are backed by labor?

Then how? Through it’s scarcity?

But it’s not. 
That’s basically a secured loan, but instead of USD as collateral you use BTC. That’s lending to people cash and assets they already have access too. Most American don’t pull out loans because they have money tied up in investments, they get loans because the need a large amount of cash and do not have it, and have the ability to pay over time.

That’s what I’m saying. 
USD is only worth something because of the interest paid on the US Bonds to the bond holder. People invest in bonds because they are a secure choice and usually a guaranteed return on investment.  For every bond purchased a dollar is issued by the Fed. 
Versus Crypto is only valuable due to supply and demand at the moment.
 
How could a coin replace that?

But if we are speaking in a world of crypto how would they mature if 1BTC = 1BTC. Right now BTC only has value because of the people willing to spend Fiat on it.

Based of a value given to it by a fiat currency

Well I think that’s why we left the gold standard. There is no way gold backed bills could support the size of the modern economy.
