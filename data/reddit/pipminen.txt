FDIC covers, dollar for dollar + interest up to $250,000 to every single depositor. 90% of people would get all their money back. Don't know what you mean by a "small bankruptcy"... Perhaps CH.11? Anyway, it's not a small portion. It may take a while to get your money, but you would eventually recover. Last time I checked, nobody is insuring Bitcoin.

That's true ... but so what? They use that money to loan to others, so they need to have control of it. In return for you letting them do that you get interest ( which sucks, but still ) you also get the ability to withdraw that money in different locations and not have to carry cash. Thus, reducing theft. Your money is secured via FDIC in case the bank goes under. 
Look, you can also have full control of your money by stuffing it in your matress. But how safe is that? Well, actually about as safe as a paper wallet... 
There are actual advantages to our banking system .. but that doesn't negate crypto. Crypto is just a new way to do the same thing that's been done for thousands of years. 
Let's not treat Crypto as a religion or demonize fiat. If we want it to succeed we need to just think of it as just another currency, not a political adversary to fiat.
