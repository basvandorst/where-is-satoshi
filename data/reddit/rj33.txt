Yea but I haven’t noticed much of a drop off. I think a lot more people were mining before the halving and now have stopped. I was getting 3.2 per day at one point. Not sure what happened then lol

One click miner. And run it on the coinotron pool with 1vtc payout threshold.

It’s been a ton of fun. I’ve made 50 VTC coins so far from mining. And about half a ZEC.

You should mine VTC with your gaming rig. I get almost one VTC per day with my 1080ti

I’ve been running vertcoin one click miner for a little over a month now and have made a decent return. I only run it when I’m at work or not playing video games. Had some issues with it for a while, so I switched to ZEC mining for a while. But for a 1080ti, I’ve found VTC as the most profitable.

Yep! Coinotron estimate shows .9 per day

OK. So if you haven't figured it out yet then here is what I got.
Go into My Account -&gt; Workers. Create a worker, (this can be anything since you will just see it on your end.) 
Go to Settings and paste your vertcoin core wallet address into the payout address. Type in how often you want the payout to be, and select Auto Payouts. Save it and then go to your Vertcoin One-Click-Miner. 
Use this as the pool address - **stratum+tcp://coinotron.com:3340**  Worker info is your account name on coinotron, followed by a period and then your worker name you created. so **username.workername**     Your password is whatever you made it in coinotron. 
Select that pool and click start next to nvidia. You should be able to log in to coinotron shortly and see your progress on the dashboard. 
Hope that helps!

Lol yes away from my desk at the moment but I will when I get back.

It’s the most profitable thing I can mine. I was mining ZEC for a while but now that VTC is $8 or so it has been a great change.

Vertcoin Core. After I get 10 or so I move to my ledger nano
