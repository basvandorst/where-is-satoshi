The USD is up like 5,000,000% from the time it was created.

Oooh, I see.
I'm learning quite a bit, thank you.
I see that the buy price is always higher than the sell price (this makes sense), so is the difference, then, essentially the fee I pay for the foreign exchange? Is it unambiguously cheaper than any forex sites?

Does this include new registrations? Might be a good time to buy my first bitcoin then :&gt;

Thanks for those sites! I did some more reading and I think I might be misunderstanding something. I am not good with explaining so I will give numerical examples:
Looking at BTCbox, the going buy rate is 35,600, but as you said, I can choose a bid price. I see from what I assume to be the last 10 purchases that they ranged from 35,000JPY to 33,000JPY for 1 BTC. 
At the current rate of 35,600, 2m JPY would get me 56.1797752809 BTC
The lower amount was 33,300, which would get me 60.0600600601 BTC
So I would save 3.88028477916 BTC, or $1326 CAD, from such a small fluctuation and I am allowed to make this happen by setting my own bids? Looking at the volitilaty and assuming it will continue to hover around this, it seems plausible that 33,000 JPY for 1BTC could be reached within a random few days. 
So if I did all this, before deductions and handling charges I could convert 2m JPY to 20533.36 CAD, while the cheapest alternative I could find would only get me 19,492--a solid $1000 in savings and even above the forex output 19,865.04, and the only risk is the chance that the bitcoin will never sell for those rates again when going back from BTC to CAD? Surely I must be mistaken.

How does changetip work? Are you calling on a bot to send money somehow? 
@_date: 2016-12-18 05:36:55
Mmm buh tik
@_date: 2016-11-10 04:49:35
Thanks a lot for your generosity. I wasn't expecting a tip but I'll put it to good use. (board games perhaps?!)

No, but it didn't sound like you were talking about thieves, only people and uprooting their lives for money 
@_date: 2017-05-01 06:46:17
I uprooted my life for negative money (opportunity cost was huge - paid a lot to do it). You can sure as hell bet I'd uproot my life for 75k

This mentality hurts the entire cryptospace. Wish we could all just get along and respect each other. 
@_date: 2016-07-12 03:07:36
Yes. Look at all the other cryptos that aren't Bitcoin
