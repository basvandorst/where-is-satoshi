Where ~30% isn't a massive dip...

"decentralization" amiright?

What's special about ARDR?

Only ripple is up today. Sucks Bitcoin is dragging it down as well

One post about Trezor and loh and behold here's another one. Nice marketing opp, PR team?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:07:51
Good job
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:54:27
Why? They're not related techs.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:54:59
What horseshit.
Fees are high because miners mine the blocks that pay more. A lot of exchanges will let you pick your fees, but smaller fee = smaller likelihood it gets picked up faster
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:00:00
You can always buy again.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:25:42
This is also gold
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:12:55
Everything else is down because the dip in bitcoins has them spooked. People losing money in bitcoins also sold them elsewhere.
Not to mention the transactional backlog is pretty scary.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:23:21
It seems like almost the same stairs. At least the same city
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:10:11
Because of btc..
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:09:10
So there's a lot more selling to even get actioned
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:35:04
There are equal if not more examples of this not working in the same sector you mention. Look at Twilio, Twitter, Groupon. People are still negative after decades of holding
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:51:35
Visa does 60k transactions/sec. In 9 years Bitcoin is neither close, nor on the route to being at that level...
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:52:52
Why today? This has been happening since forever
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:03:11
It really is time to cash out..
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:57:21
Hope this is sarcastic

Well did you get it

What does this mean?

Next send them Enrons and the housing market crash
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:32:50
That's because people are not buying based on popularity or adoption or future value, but instead based on potential for short term gains and momentum in price appreciation.
This won't always be the case
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:56:18
It'll get a lot worse.

Read the title and all SAY: "Decentralization" 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:50:40
You can't. Blockchain.info
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:05:59
"high cost, low speed" I like that you included the word solution there too
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:59:10
There are 280k failed/stuck transactions. And it's getting worse
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:50:30
yes, but 12.5 BTC now is worth a lot. You wouldn't just buy 1 BTC now as you used to tip before.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:59:29
They are. Until they actually crash, which dips are the first indicators of.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:26:05
What have you done...
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:11:41
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:08:21
Not really. No one "invents" gpu mining. It's obvious
@_date: 2014-04-16 08:52:02
Done. Moving.
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:28:29
Brillianty happy.
@_date: 2014-10-15 16:57:45
@_date: 2014-06-18 02:45:48
I'm seriously interested in this too. That was a clever side step.
@_date: 2014-08-15 11:23:16
Yeah. But that sounds like what you could do everyday and frankly sounds pretty mundane. Also $800 could buy 2, but not all of those things.
Burning man is worth $800 if you've done it right.
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:43:56
You need excellent 20-20

Hope he sat tight as Enron went bankrupt
@_date: 2015-05-30 09:50:00
So should the government spy on people or not spy on people? Can't plese everyone
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:03:03
I'mma try this
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:33:49
also horrid transaction fees BOTH ways (buying AND selling), when instead you can buy directly from GDAX (their own exchange) with limit buys (not supported on coinbase -- read more profits on spread).
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:05:17
Shit. Op pls respond
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:02:46
Now that's a bamboozleboozlebam
@_date: 2017-08-02 08:40:44
think of the fees it has cost to mine that. avg is above $25 right now
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:33:18
Op's mom does not know what BTC is, but thought of sending a picture to her son of it?

I should create some with 1000000 BTC then. Hmm
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:04:27
Why is it that in these cases there's always buildup. I'm calling bamboozle
!remindme 14 days

How do I download on to a hardware wallet from coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:19:23
Or buy with gdax and transfer. No fees
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:35:07
Why not just leave in their wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-10 04:15:38
You say that now. But you underestimate the biggest bubble in the world

You don't say how?
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:39:00
0.25% of the world's currency is a lot...

That trade is not in the US
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:46:57
Except this time there is no tether to prop up the price.

are yall being serious?

Also JPM bought 46 BTC worth. Of TBX, an ETN on the swedish stock exchange.

Read about interest rates. It's at a low
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:53:24
oh no
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:21:15
Not really. Tell that to Janet yellen raising rates at the protest of everyone, but sound data
@_date: 2018-04-08 18:19:05
Not to skip! Where he literally mentions [he shills coins for six figure payouts]( Since he's found it borderline illegal to do for traditional securities like $MGT, he's moved his scam business to Cryptocurrency, to loot the gullible.
@_date: 2015-11-03 06:59:50
Woahhh $10??
@_date: 2017-07-28 07:02:43
The problem for Bitcoin's low transaction rate isn't demand, neither is it intended. It's the lack of capacity of the network to scale. Here's BTCs mempool size and resulting backlog for processing transactions: 
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:07:19
If by increased adoption, you mean 3 transactions per second. Visa does 50k/s, yet still there is barely any liquidity and the Bitcoin chain delay right now is 15-20 days, and the network uses the electricity equivalent of the whole country of Iceland, to move data equivalent to a 14.4k mode.
What good is a currency that is neither liquid nor secure, that you have to take it off circulation?
@_date: 2017-07-23 05:50:37
Um. This is horrible speculative advice.
If what goes up, kept going up, everyone would be predictably rich. On the other hand, what goes up that fast, if more likely to be an unfounded bubble.
@_date: 2017-07-23 05:49:11
Better than calmly selling it at $1000
@_date: 2017-07-28 05:29:13
um, the detailed report Bank of America published actually stressed why Bitcoin does not qualify as legitimate currency yet. There's a detailed internal PDF but it's also covered [here](
Of course, coinjournal.com will publish misleading headlines, since it passed the trading volume of **an ETF**, which doesn't say much. Literally right in the article, 


Ignorance is bliss?
@_date: 2016-07-01 13:39:38
They will give it back for free, for all perspective from the user

@_date: 2017-07-13 07:06:02
Is it? What are those banks then, and what amount did each get?
