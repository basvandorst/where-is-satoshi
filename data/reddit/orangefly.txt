Idk.  Is it possible to use a bank and make just the balance public?  As long as the funds are there, cool.  The minute there is one cent less than what should be there, then we panic.  I wouldn't even care in the slightest that they were keeping all the interest as payment for taking on the responsibility.  Just spit-balling here.  It would be nice to have a secure way to move money into something less volatile when you want to try to sell a peak and buy a dip.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:15:25
Well, if I've learned anything from all these experts, it's that BTC will be worth either $100,000 or six bucks in the next year.  Glad we have that cleared up.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:36:03
I don't think I've ever agreed with someone and wanted to punch them so much before in my life.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:58:11
Maybe once they put some effort into body design.  Those things are boring and ugly looking.  If I'm paying that much for a car, it would be nice if it didn't blend in with every other cheap, generic body design out there.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:32:04
Yeah, it's crazy that it's this difficult to come up with a way to give someone free interest off of possibly a few billion dollars without them getting greedy and taking all of it.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:02:59
Why?  Do you mean tether specifically or do you think people shouldn't have an option other than selling on coinbase for actual USD if they want to buy and sell dips?
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:08:40
What?  Regardless of whatever your point is, my portfolio is down less than it would be if I had it all in BTC so it was a wise decision to hold more in the alts.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:32:42
And always twirrrrrrling...TWIRRRRRRLING...
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:14:27
Would it be that hard to make a coin, sell it for one USD, put that money into some kind of guaranteed account with some kind of transparency, and make some free money off the interest?  The coin would likely rise in value at least a little just for having the 100% guarantee of getting a minimum of one USD in return from the people running the account.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:09:36
Most of my alts are down less than BTC.  I'll be leaving mine as is.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:53:19
The guy in that video had a punchable face with that arrogant tone.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:48:58
It's further in the red in USD value than most of my alts.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:40:13
Wtf are you talking about?  I have several coins down less that that.  I find the cult like mentality in each sub for their preferred coin amusing.  Best of luck.
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:28:59
Interesting.  I will keep an eye on that.  Thanks.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:02:59
The extent of my wife's involvement is me updating her periodically on how to get to everything and get the money out if I get hit by a bus or something.
@_date: 2016-12-24 23:40:32
Yup, that's the standard cult like response you get when you report anything negative about coinbase.
@_date: 2016-12-24 23:42:26
How does that in any way justify not telling me what is going on?  It' been 2 weeks.  As far as I'm soncerned, they have stolen money and are holding my bank info on their site against my will.  I know it's a drop in the bucket for them but I have personally stopped people I know from putting a few thousand in their and will continue to inform people of their shady activity so that it hopefully costs them more customers.
@_date: 2016-12-17 18:18:50
Coinbase is NOT legit.  I just got tired of trying to get a response from them and told them to fuck off and keep my money.  Thankfully I was testing them out with small amounts of money just for this reason.
@_date: 2016-12-11 06:44:55
Running scans but how the hell could they get the code off my phone too?
@_date: 2016-12-22 01:41:04
Yup.  I've never had paypal steal from me but coinbase has.
@_date: 2016-12-25 09:08:57
The voting does not seem to be in your favor.  You think maybe you should attack the right people now?
@_date: 2016-12-17 17:25:52
So is coinbase.  I guess we're running out of options.
@_date: 2016-12-17 01:52:48
I'll have to research those but that's not a bad idea.  Networking is always good.  I'm sure I could find something of value that they can't access in canada.  Like guns or bacon that isn't actually ham.  Thanks.
@_date: 2016-12-22 01:37:53
Don't use coinbase if you can help it.  They are shady as hell.
@_date: 2016-12-21 15:45:48
I had to chuckle first and then come back and ask.


That's cute.  Even if they were lies, what possible negative repercussions could there be from some shady bitcoin site or their shill redditor?
@_date: 2016-12-10 19:52:33
Am I the only person on earth that puts fox in the MSM category?  I mean, they are the biggest so idk how you could not consider them main stream.  I'm certainly not right wing at all and I consider all cable news to be a joke.  It's 90% opinion/entertainment/ratings above all else.  What's wrong with being against people who's main goal is to spread fear and hate in one direction or another to profit off you?
@_date: 2016-12-13 12:40:37
I replied to the email for the ticket and added that email.  PMing you my email address so you know which ticket it is.
@_date: 2016-12-21 15:37:18
Nope, just didn't feel like leaving an actual post up and having biased idiots like you harassing me.  They are thieves and I will continue to do what I can to cost them every cent of business I can.  I know it's a drop in the bucket but I know I've personally cost them a few thousand already.  Better than nothing.
@_date: 2016-12-22 01:42:08
Definitely not coinbase.  They ripped me off but luckily it was during my small deposit testing phase of a new site.
@_date: 2016-12-11 06:47:03
Sorry but there is still nothing mildly centrist about fox.  They are still VERY far right for the US which makes them insanely right globally.
@_date: 2016-12-25 00:22:02
Also, I just went back through the emails and they asked me if I recognized a wallet address because they couldn't tell where it was going.  That rules out the blacklisted site theory.
@_date: 2016-12-11 06:44:20
I did and they are checking on it.  They responded pretty quickly.  Yeah, it's really odd someone would have the code off my phone too and it is definitely good it was only $20.  Before they locked my account to investigate, I changed my password to something ridiculously long.
@_date: 2016-12-17 18:21:10
No, it's just a coincidence that coinbas also happens to be shady and crappy.
@_date: 2016-12-17 17:11:07
Cex.io isn't available in my area but DON'T use coinbase.  They ripped me off and stopped responding to emails.
@_date: 2016-12-21 18:38:05
Yes, I completely made up everything!
I just want to remove my bank information and close my account.  They can keep the piddly amount I have on there.  I expect another email after the normal 5 day waiting period between contact to tell me why they can't allow me to remove my bank info or close my account for "security" reasons.  I've already spoken to my bank and informed them that any future transactions to that website should be considered fraud.  Hopefully that helps protect me from these people at least a little by keeping things documented.
@_date: 2016-12-24 19:35:16
If you consider losing access to your account for 2 weeks with little communication acceptable for anything financially related, then you have very low standards.  Refusing to allow me to remove my banking information and close my account is about as shady as it gets.  Recommending coinbase to new people is irresponsible.
@_date: 2016-12-17 18:20:19
Not me.  Screw coinbase.  I hope they lose.
@_date: 2016-12-19 12:21:01
I'd love to send them to my wallet.  I never had a chance with the two ACHs.
@_date: 2016-12-16 15:46:16
My two other ACH deposits are in and I still can't access my account.  Is it possible to have them transferred out if I give you the address?
@_date: 2016-12-18 23:31:38
Yeah, coinbase ripped me off too.  Fuck those people.
@_date: 2016-12-20 23:22:18
I guess we'll never have any accountability  Simply buying bitcoins will always be a gamble, and bitcoin will never grow past shady websites.
People with your attitude are also one of the big reasons bitcoins growth will be limited.
@_date: 2016-12-25 16:16:19
Thanks for that info.  I may be overreacting but I think it's reasonable to be upset at the lack of communication.
@_date: 2016-12-25 02:42:55
Ok, honestly, what would you do?  Would you just sit quietly for weeks or even months and just hope they'll eventually take care of it?  Maybe it's because my job deals with a lot of different kinds of support globally but I expect better communication than an email every 5 days.
@_date: 2016-12-11 09:00:38
ok but I still need to know how it was done without access to my phone before I even think about giving them a another cent.
@_date: 2016-12-10 16:33:59
Yeah, that's why I was trying out the "investing" part of it.  Odds are if you wait long enough, the house will be up.
Also, I kick ass at football betting and have been up every single week this year.  Not by a lot because I spread it around but still.
@_date: 2016-12-01 14:47:58
Isn't that how scientology kicked their asses?
@_date: 2016-12-16 23:49:07
Do you know of any besides coinbase that you can buy instantly with a card in Ohio?  Cex.io and Coinmama are "not available in my area".
@_date: 2016-12-12 15:35:54
Thanks.  They have a ticket open for me and locked my account.  Before they locked it I changed the password to something really long and I have scanned my PC with a few things.  I didn't find a couple of possible nefarious files and got rid of them.  I answered the questions from the ticket but haven't heard back yet so I'm not sure what the next step is.
Would you still like me to email that other support email?
@_date: 2016-12-17 17:32:10
Is it possible to pay instantly with a card on bitsquare?  Coinbase ripped me off so I'm looking for another option.
@_date: 2016-12-24 18:41:28
I'm still looking around as I am pretty new myself.  A lot of people have recommended gemini.com and localbitcoins.com.  I would suggest testing sites out with small amounts like I did.  If I had thousands of dollars in coinbase, I'd be a lot more upset.
@_date: 2016-12-22 01:39:05
Coinbase is a scam.
@_date: 2016-12-24 21:07:48
I had done ACHs and they were fine so I was OK with putting my card on. As soon as I made a purchase with my card, the bitcoins went right back out to a wallet I didn't know. I reported this, they locked my account, and I got 2 emails 5 days apart each. I have no idea what is going on and it appears they are done responding.
I just don't understand why they won't unlock my account so I can get my remaining coins and get my bank info off there. I even said I was fine with just saying it must have been on my end and I have taken steps to prevent it in the future.
@_date: 2016-12-24 21:23:10
They were informed instantly and there were still 2 pending ACHs that went through 3 days later. Whatever happened, it's not an excuse for keeping my coins and not telling me what's going on.
@_date: 2016-12-17 17:09:47
Plus coinbase likes to steal money.  It's my goal in life to cost them customers.
@_date: 2016-12-16 00:11:52
I guess at this point it's doesn't really matter.  No response since sunday and I have 2 ACHs completing tomorrow.  That's why I always test these kinds of things with small amounts.  The only thing left to do is contact my bank and hope they can do something or I just cut my losses.  The search for a trustworthy site to buy bitcoin continues.
@_date: 2016-12-25 00:17:55
I'm not new to investing.  I always start with several small transactions to test out sites and make sure they are legit.  They aren't getting away with a whole lot of money.  My main concern is getting my bank info off their site and closing my account.  I also notified my bank that any transactions from that site should be considered fraud.  Idk if that will help me if they do steal more money but there's not a whole lot more I can do unless they take enough money to make it worth hiring a lawyer.
@_date: 2016-12-24 22:52:10
The way the Bitcoin community instantly blames people that get screwed over by these sites is one of the big reasons it's never going to become as big as it could. Do you work for coinbase? I can see no other reason you would defend  them for being this shady.
@_date: 2016-12-17 17:59:39
Do NOT use coinbase.  They like to steal money and not respond to emails.
@_date: 2016-12-22 01:40:20
Worse.  Coinbase straight up steals from people.
@_date: 2016-12-17 22:41:49
I'll be doing ACHs through localbitcoins.  I just wish there was an instant option somewhere.
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:54:51
Considering no one wears watches anymore, congrats?
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:24:09
But with crypto ICOs, people are still buying the coins, they just pay more after the ICO.  I'm not sure how this protects anyone.  Every way the US is handling crypto does nothing but put americans at a disadvantage with the rest of the world.  As far as I know, the US is the only country making crypto to crypto trades a taxable event.
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:48:24
Why is this an unacceptable risk but things like casinos that are a virtual guarantee you will lose your money are ok?  There are countless ways dumb people give their money away.  Why is one that you can actually do research on and make an educated decision so much worse than others that are WAY more likely to fail?
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:58:50
It is history repeating itself.  But in a way the government can't control.  I think the transition from 2017 to 2018 was a big deal.  Millions of people will not be paying taxes because they can't or won't pay taxes on a loss.  Because of the lack of of even attempting to adapt to the new tech, people will look at it like torrents.  In a way it is. Good luck tracking down everyone not paying taxes on crypto.  I'd guess the US government probably loses out on around a billion dollars in taxes because they did it wrong.

I can't believe you took that much time to type all that bullshit out.  That doesn't remotely justify one being legal and not the other.  It's a FACT that you have the ability to educate yourself enough to increase your chances of picking a good investment but you cannot do that for gambling.    If you think you would have a better chance if you put all of your money on one number on a roulette table than you would picking a business to invest in, then I hope you neither gamble nor invest, ever.  You're not equipped for it.
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:39:39
Do you actually say the date as The 1st of January, 1752 though?  If you do, cool, if not, idk why you would write something in a different way than you say it.
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:07:39
But, it doesn't.  Unless you can show me how the most common way of trading stocks is one stock to another.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:22:11
No crypto has any value to me in the slightest and I wouldn't accept it as payment for anything without the ability to instantly sell it for fiat.  The only reason I have any is because other people are willing to pay money for it.

What does that have to do with the fact that the US is taxing more than pretty much any other country.  It really sucks when your government wants to give you a disadvantage compared to everyone else.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:05:52
I think this should be treated as something new though.  What are the odds of someone trading 50+ baseball cards for other baseball cards in a day?  Who benefits from having it this way?  Let a few million people raise their status in life and enjoy the long term benefits of them having to pay taxes on being wealthier.  Don't make it harder and give them disadvantages compared to the rest of the world.  It will only hurt our country overall.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:47:41
People buy with cash but while I don't have a source, I'd bet a good 90% of trades are from BTC to an altcoin and back.
Let me give you a common scenario.  A big part of the problem is people new to "investing".  I put that in quotes because many people getting into crypto had no stock investing experience.
Say someone put $1,000 into crypto in December 2017.  They could have easily doubled that to $2,000 by trading BTC for an alt, that alt back to btc, that btc back to another alt, etc.  Now they have gained $1,000 on paper and they owe say $300 on that gain.  They didn't sell that crypto for USD before December 31st so they don't actually have that profit in hand.  Then the market tanks to the point that their total assets in crypto can be sold for around $500.  They now have to sell that crypto to pay their taxes and they now have $200 left in value of crypto.  They lost money but only because of taxes.  Their option to hold for the market to go back up has been taken away.  They lost money and got taxed on it.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:15:50
I guess I just don't understand how it helps.  People can still buy these stocks, and in this case, coins, but they just have to pay more for them after the IPO/ICO when the people involved in the IPO/ICO sell them at a higher price.
@_date: 2018-02-05 06:09:42
Just guessing.  It could be in the mid hundreds of millions.  I really doubt that the millions of people that didn't sell december 31st and held are going to just pay the taxes on a huge loss.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:40:02
Eh, I don't work that hard.  Easy come, easy go.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:20:25
They can't take too many more options from defenses or there's not going to be any point to the game.  They've already made not assisting the receiver with catching the ball an automatic first down at the spot of the "foul".
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:06:30
People made a ton in december and because they didn't cash out before december 31st, they now owe a ton of taxes on money they don't have after crypto crashed.
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:54:13
You and six other people in your state are wearing one right now.  I've never actually seen anyone wearing one.
@_date: 2018-02-05 06:51:23
Nah, you're talking millions of people made several thousand dollars last year and then lost it all when it crashed at the end of January.  You sound like someone that's angry they didn't get in early and want those that did to pay.  You should get past the sour grapes stage and work towards making money somewhere yourself.
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:48:45
Then that would make sense for crypto mutual funds.  We're comparing the standard for trading crypto to the standard to trading stocks.  At least that was your original comparison.  Crypto is different than trading individual stocks and should be treated different.  Pretty much every other country is.  Most countries tax but they see the difference and don't tax until an actual realized gain.  Do we really want to put our citizens at a disadvantage to the rest of the world at raising their level of wealth?  I don't see how that benefits us as a country.
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:09:25
ICOs aren't usually offered in the US because they are like IPOs and require investors to be accredited.


Because it is different.  A normal crypto trade IS between different cryptos.  A normal trade with stocks is between stocks and cash where you actually realize a gain instantly.  It needs to be looked at differently and taxed differently.  If the only way to be safe with cryptos and taxes is to cash out every time you make a tiny profit or to cash out on december 31st every year, then the system is flawed.
@_date: 2018-02-15 01:04:41
That's because unless they cashed out on December 31st, there's a good chance they either don't have enough in crypto left to pay the taxes or they refuse to pay taxes on a loss.  The US tax laws for crypto are ridiculous and pretty much the worst on the planet.
