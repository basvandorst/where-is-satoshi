Still slow, especially if one looks at the high end of the distribution. I've waited an hour or so for first confirmation multiple times.
Note: this is not advocating for fast block times as they have their issues as well, but just observing the very real usability issue.

It incentivizes locking coins, but not actually running nodes. There is no proof the people doing that are actually running (unique) nodes, nor that that the nodes aren't (or won't be) under the control over some central hosting service, which in turn can run one node, claim to be many, and receive many rewards. This is almost certain to happen if the costs of running a node were to rise (for now it is currently possible to do it with a very cheap VPS but with a heavily-used network that would not be the case). In short, the alleged node incentives in Dash incentivize cheating and centralization more than they incentivize running nodes.

There are use cases for it, if you know what you are doing.
For example, I have acted as escrow on BTC-for-alt trades where I intentionally forwarded unconfirmed BTC from the buyer to the seller, while continuing to hold the alt. If in turned out that the original payment didn't confirm, the forwarding payment to the seller wouldn't either. Upon confirmation, only then would I deliver the alt. No added risk here, and seller gets their BTC faster.

The unique 1000 Dash is the constraint that prevents unlimited masternodes, but there nothing that prevents many masternodes from running on the same hardware and therefore not adding anything to the real node count. I'd be very surprised if that were not already being done.

No, he said "guarantee". If you want a "guarantee" of getting into a particular block, then too bad, adjust your expectations instead. It is even possible that the next block comes from a miner who doesn't include *any* transactions the block. That doesn't make being able to adjust your transactions' fees useless.

There is a sticky about it on r/monero. The author of the paper updates his comments there regularly.
@_date: 2015-06-21 06:11:50
This is basically right but the key image set still grows forever. You certainly don't need to store the signatures (which are the largest part of the transactions by far) once you have verified them unless you want to be an archive node. That makes the difference between Monero pruning and Bitcoin pruning fairly small in practice over the medium term (not short term since Monero pruning isn't implemented at all currently).
@_date: 2015-12-20 20:49:38
That's not his line of reasoning. His line of reasoning is that this particular improvement can be implemented on a Bitcoin sidechain and using segwit. 
That's not true of every single altcoin "improvement". For example, some altcoins have inflationary money supplies and that can never be implemented in Bitcoin. Different types of cryptographic signatures certainly can be though.
@_date: 2015-06-21 06:26:48
The amounts is only partially hidden, in a way similar to regular coinjoin (you can't tell which outputs are going to which recipient). The total amount of the transaction isn't hidden, which is both good and bad. It provides transparency to some kinds of bugs that might otherwise invisibly inflate the money supply. which is good. On the other hand it does provide some clues that could be used to analyze the blockchain, so that is bad.

Coinjoin is not signature aggregation, although signature aggregation can be used to improve coinjoin. 
Here is the actual correct reference for 'What is coinjoin?':

The issue is not really law enforcement acquiring hash rate, it is just pressuring miners to make small changes in how they operate. Miners are a business (especially now that mining is highly industrialized) and most business just want to make money and avoid legal trouble.
@_date: 2016-06-11 02:08:05
Not selectively though, and not with the sort of "small" regulatory requirements that might be more palatable to miners than such a strict requirement. That approach would effectively ban the coin as it exists today, likely making it harder to get buy-in. 
One could argue whether such an all-or-none approach is a good thing or not.
Also, Monero mining is nowhere near as centralized as Bitcoin and most of the community probably doesn't ever want it to ever be. That's a whole other discussion too.
@_date: 2016-06-09 22:41:17
First mover advantage is exactly that. An advantage, not an automatic, game over, ignore everything else, win. When you see something that has overtaken a competitor with first mover advantage, you should probably take notice because it means there was another huge offsetting advantage that was more important than who was first (Facebook, Myspace, etc., etc.)
Which is why Bitcoiners (and I include myself in that group) need to pay attention to whatever else is going on in the world and not assume that being the first blockchain based cryptocurrency is all that matters.
@_date: 2016-06-02 04:01:50
Both Monero [and Zcash]( have ever-growing storage requirement but the rate of growth is small enough to not be a concern any time soon. (And for that matter so does Bitcoin given unspendable UTXOs, but again manageable for now.) Some methods for replacing them with something else have been proposed but aren't fully fleshed out and is somewhat off topic here.
@_date: 2018-06-12 07:15:30


1. This is hyperbolic. Monero is 4+ years old, and there is no new favorite version anyone is looking to switch to, so even if this did happen the cycle would by current evidence be many years (possibly never) not a half-year.
2. Monero has a track record of implementing and deploying improvements in situ without needing to switch to another coin (minimum ring size, ringct, bulletproofs, etc.), so again there is evidence that such a switch may never happen or be needed.
Anyway, in case it is unclear I'm not supportive of people showing up here and shilling Monero into what appears to me to have been a Bitcoin discussion. Monero might have some valuable lessons from which Bitcoin can learn and vice versa but that's no reason to go telling people to switch coins. This is 2018, people are well aware of the available options for doing so.
@_date: 2015-08-19 07:53:13


The gap will widen *for a time* but there is an ever growing subset that consists of newly-created outputs that will never be spent. Inevitably this legacy subset of the UXTO set must grow to dominate the active subset. Thus O(N) with a smaller constant.
Unless you are willing to kill off old "abandoned" outputs (a social contract issue I would imagine), and if you do that you can prune Monero too.
Nevertheless it is certainly true that Monero does and will have a physically larger TXO set as a practical mater, which is a tradeoff with privacy.

@_date: 2017-09-10 05:00:57


I agree with this. Therefore it is impossible for any change to be made without it having significant effect on users, and for users to have an important interest (positive, negative or neutral) in its deployment. 
Telling users they can "ignore" it or "opt out" is misleading at best.
No one is arguing the merits of segwit, nor claiming that the system should never change.
@_date: 2017-09-10 04:12:47
The claim was these things are "opt in" and that a user can "just ignore" them. That's flat wrong, when viewed from the proper system-wide platform perspective. Users are impacted by systemwide changes whether they make personal use of a particular feature or not.
@_date: 2017-09-09 23:53:04


I don't agree. There is really nothing a user (who owns bitcoins, or has some other stake in it) "can ignore". The properties of a system like this and the value of its token are very much a function of the entirety of its technical properties, implementation, and deployment.
That might not be true in a distant future when the success and value and stability of the overall system are well established and can be assumed, but at this stage when those are all very much in question, users can't rationally just ignore what ever else is going on in the system as if it doesn't affect them.
I'm not arguing against segwit or CLTV here (I happen to think both are useful improvements, and as a Bitcoin user I support them, whether or not I personally use them), but against the notion that users' legitimate interests extend only to their own transactions. That's very wrong-headed.
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:15:00
Those are apparently all pseudonyms. Most are easily recognizable as variations of famous scientist names.
@_date: 2017-09-10 07:00:27


False. The security premise of Bitcoin (quoting from the white paper) is that &gt;50% of miners are not colluding to attack the network (e.g. via censorship). Thus in that sense these 'assumed' soft forks as you describe them are impossible unless the system is being attacked, and it is perverse to claim that users have agreed to be attacked (though they may be, and should be, aware that such an attack is always possible).
In reality the Bitcoin community is not currently organized in a manner that makes such a premise valid, and in fact Bitcoin can't be described as secure under the model in the white paper.
This is convenient for the purpose of upgrades but someone undertaking to "upgrade the network by attacking it" should not be surprised (nor seek to delegitimize) the opinions nor actions of users who are affected by this form of (allegedly) benevolent attack and don't like it.
Again, reality is what it is. I don't ascribe malicious motives to the devs nor do I oppose segwit or other user improvements that have been made by these benevolent attacks (aka soft forks). I just reject the notion of expecting or instructing users that their reasonable response is to ignore or opt out of using the features that the (again, allegedly benevolent) attackers have enabled if they don't like that is going on. That's wrong headed and counterproductive.
@_date: 2017-09-26 20:46:49
It most certainly is shady as fuck that you can sell bitcoin there, pay an exchange fee, and only then be told that you can't withdraw the USD. 
Sure you can buy bitcoin and withdraw it to another exchange to then sell it _again_ (paying several more fees in the process, including to them thank you very much), but WTF. If they can't deliver the USD, it borders on fraud to keep accepting fees from people selling BTC for USD there.
"All other site functions are working" = yes we'll take your fee for exchanging and then not pay out.
I sympathize with their banking issues but if they can't deliver USD then they should disable the USD pairs, and maybe replace with USDT pairs or something they can deliver. Or at a minimum put a banner on the USD pair pages warning that withdrawal will be impossible.
This is among the many examples of incompetent and/or dishonest bad actor behavior in this space that will continue to bring down more regulatory heat than would otherwise be needed. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 23:48:51


The white paper says "The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the hash begins with a number of zero bits"
SHA-256 is given as [an example]( of a hash function that can be used. It does not specify a particular hash function to be used.
@_date: 2015-09-30 20:04:29
"Superior" might mean "exists". :)
I do agree that ZeroCash will likely leak less information, which is good. I've also noted elsewhere that Monero is not tied to the specific set of current techniques and is already changing some of them. If the ZeroCash crypto is mature and trusted, we can add it or switch to it.
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:23:19
You're assuming the privacy can't break too.
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:28:15


Yes i agree, but you said worst case and talked about being dead. That could *also* happen if the privacy crypto is broken somehow.
@_date: 2015-09-30 19:49:09
Anonymous is a fairly vague word, and probably means different things to different people, so I agree it isn't really a good term to use for anything other than "stay home in a closet and don't ever come out".
However, I will say that watching the transactions being sent from a Monero user does not break the privacy assumptions of the system. It is assumed that other people already know which transaction you sent (for example the person you sent it to) so this can't be the case.  
The key reason for this is that even correlating 100% of the traffic on your connection will not reveal anything about the payments you *receive*, so it isn't possible to break the unlinkability or untraceability or  that way. 
There are some hybrid attacks possible given how change works but those can be fixed and can even now be avoided by extremely paranoid users with very careful use. 
Now maybe you want even the mere fact that you sent a transaction (or that you are using the network at all) to be (more) private, which is a fair point and is the reason for wanting to run over Tor or i2p. These same issues apply to ZeroCash.
@_date: 2016-10-22 09:44:51


I'm certainly not either. In the case of coins like dogecoin, it means the asymptotic money supply is constant (at least over a time period when the rate of average rate of lost coins is stable), not growing. I'm not saying whether _that_ is good or bad, however.
@_date: 2016-10-22 01:29:18
I wasn't trying to sell anything, just making an observation about how the math works. (Nor, by the way was I saying anything whatsoever about whether inflationary, deflationary, or content money supplies are "good" or "bad".)
I disagree with you on this: Lost is different from saved in that it will certainly never be spent. Whether an actual key is lost or not is of course not observable (unless you are the one who lost it), but we can make mathematical inferences in the aggregate assuming the rate of lost coins is &gt;0% (which I personally find to be a certainly correct assumption).
@_date: 2016-10-21 22:25:00
There is an earlier paper somewhere that argues that **_either_** a block reward **_or_** a block size limit is needed. I haven't read this latest paper to see whether the stability of the second approach (block size limit) is refuted.
@_date: 2016-10-23 19:37:57


That doesn't work according to the logic of the linked post, which suggests that to avoid introducing perverse incentives, transaction fees can only serve as an incentive to include the transition into the block. The cost-to-include, and therefore necessary incentive, does not depend on coin age. Or to put it another way, "large" fees based on spending old coins has exactly the same incentive problems described in the linked post as large fees for some other reason such as wanting to incentivize hash rate.
@_date: 2015-11-08 23:11:26
The problem with your statement is that I'm not arguing the security of join market or coinjoin-like systems, you are.
There is simply no way to know whether the pool is getting more or less honest, even if the pool gets larger. Sybil attacks don't work the way you think they do, and you can't even support that they get exponentially harder 
(which is false). If the pool gets twice as large, a sybil attacker can create twice as many identities, and not only doesn't this cost money, with the maker-taker system, the attacker could even make a profit.
The problem is extremely difficulty to solve, and may even be unsolvable, something Peter understands and you don't.
@_date: 2016-10-22 22:26:06
You still use mining services if you don't transfer. It keeps your coins secure and also keeps the system alive that allows you to use them when you choose to do so.
That savers pay nothing toward mining is a free rider problem. It means in general there will be less mining than savers as a group would prefer.
@_date: 2016-10-21 22:24:19
It actually reaches zero after accounting for lost coins. Bitcoin will have negative inflation in practice (given &gt;0 lost coins).
The dogecoin model produces exactly what most Bitcoin supporters claim to want (zero inflation) along with permanent block rewards the keep mining from becoming unstable. It is still a hard sell to those who have already bought in to the concept of fixed total production.

No that is not what he is saying. He's saying that *all three* of shapeshift, xmr.to, and Monero's cryptographic mixing have to be compromised for it to fail. Strictly speaking that is still "probably" pretty good, but is far better than what you misquoted.
@_date: 2015-11-06 22:59:00


Simple estimate that is a lot closer than original "60-70% in a year" is 50% in 18 months (and then 50% of remaining 18 months thereafter, etc). It is a bit more than twice as fast as Bitcoin (which mines 50% of the remaining amount every 4 years). This all ignores the tail disinflation.
@_date: 2015-11-08 22:37:16
If you are using your own wallet in between shapeshift and xmr.to as I suggested in another comment and what Peter said he is doing, then you are NOT trusting counterparties. There is *no way* to link the shapeshift and xmr.to tranasctions except via defeating the cryptography anonymity of Monero itself or with timing-type attacks which are avoided with careful use.
@_date: 2015-11-08 23:59:01


That's wrong. The larger the *ratio* of honest makers and takers to dishonest ones, the lower the probability. The problem is that you have no idea the size of either, and the size of the pool of dishonest ones is not fixed. That's *exactly* what a Sybil attack means.
@_date: 2015-10-13 13:28:19
There are plenty of explanations in other comments so I'll keep it brief but it doesn't depend on people using it a lot of the time because mixing is with outputs that already exist in the blockchain, not with transactions occurring at the same time. It is a fundamentally different approach to mixing than what people are familiar with from Bitcoin mixers, coinjoin, etc. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 20:59:41
The privacy-correct way to do this is shapeshift-&gt;your own XMR wallet-&gt;xmr.to (ideally without reusing exact amounts and with some time delays). That removes the exposure to third party logging. Network-level exposure can be managed by, for example, using a public access point (and/or Tor if you trust it, etc.)
@_date: 2015-11-08 22:55:06
What Peter is telling you is that it isn't just as good.
I agree with you about counterparty risk. Ideally one would like to see trustless exchange protocols used. I don't agree with respect to privacy because in join market (any coinjoin system) you do have privacy counterparties, and you don't even know who they are. You can dismiss that with hand-wavy arguments about it being exponentially difficult to attack or *probably* just as good, but Peter and I both disagree with you (or at least disagree that you have made a strong argument).
I actually believe that the maker-taker system is set up to fail economically unless it gets massive adoption because the most economically-motivated actors will tend to be malicious. (What it does do is hide limited adoption behind ample short-term liquidity, but you have no way to know that is *honest* liquidity.) But that's an independent question of whether you have made a strong argument for the security of the system, because you have not.

There was no "unambiguous" theft. The thousands of reddit comments on both sides and countless other debates on the topic illustrate there is a great deal of ambiguity about the whole thing.
