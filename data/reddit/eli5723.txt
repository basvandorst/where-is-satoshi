Dude, answer or admit that you are wrong. 3582 comment karma doesn't ring "troll" to me.

That they don't make money by letting computers do useless calculations?
@_date: 2014-03-15 20:09:38
Anyways, i'm not attacking bitcoin, or your way of life. I'm just saying that it could use some reforms, such as being made into a shared computing pool to solve calculations for the benefit of humanity.

Coding programs to assist people in their work? Seriously, you are one ignorant jerkwad. "Working Class mentality" As in useful class? You didn't even answer the question.

Finding precious minerals that were previously trapped in the earth to make luxury items and electronics?

And your system proceeds to do what? Solve hashes?
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:39:04
Then explain.

Like handing someone stable, government issued (and protected) cash?

Producing cars for people to drive.

To answer your dumb ass as best as I can, I don't think you get the question. What does mining bitcoins do besides solving hashes?  Jack split, that's what. You don't make cars. You don't make software. You just use copious amounts of electricity to do random calculations and receive money. Besides, the majority of your reply was an angry reply to something that I never said. Bitcoin pays, but that's besides the point you halfwit elitist.

What? Anyways, businesses have to work to make money.
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:38:54
I meant lazy, but made a typo.
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:13:40
Is that really why you mine bitcoins? Freeing the people? or is it money?

A coal miner helps harvest a precious energy source trapped deep withing the earth?
