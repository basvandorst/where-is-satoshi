Dangerous: the article is full of misinformation, such as: "A Bitcoin transaction zeroes out the balance at the spending address."  This is not true at all.  A bitcoin transaction must spend the sum of all inputs that it signs.  A transaction does not need to spend all inputs that it "could" sign.  An address might have the ability to spend several distinct outputs, and a transaction might spend only some number of those outputs as inputs.  This under a section claiming to explain "how bitcoin transactions really work".

3/4ths of the world does not have enough money to make it profitable to provide banking services to them.


Because it is profitable.  Fines are less than the amount of money to be made, therefore just a cost of doing business


Because we can take additional risk, and potentially profit more by taking large bets, that we don't need to pay off if we happen to lose.


Who do you think makes this decision?  Someone other than the executives?


Because we want to keep as much money on our books as possible, so that we can borrow against customer money and goodwill as collateral, so that we can make risky, but usually profitable, bets.

They are directed by the same incentives that we are.  Why compete when you make more through capture?


Screw up?  We did tremendously well in 2008: we got to take huge risks, make a bunch of profit, and when we accidentally screwed the pooch on some bad bets, we got to keep our businesses, even though we lost all of our clients and stockholders money!  Risk free gambling where we keep the profits, but taxpayers eat the losses.  Seems brilliant to me.


Too philosophical.  This is all about money.


Until starving (public), and until we stop paying them off and offering them executive positions after retirement (government)


Maybe we should invest more in PR, but that costs money.  Our customers need us too much to leave, and are only outraged when they're on internet forums.

To your question "what if you construct a transaction and you receive coins at one of the unspents".  Addresses are not spent or unspent.  Transaction outputs are spent or unspent.  You can't receive change at an "unspent" - the change is a brand new unspent, able to be spent by your address.  You can receive change to an address that is able to sign an unspent, then that address is simply able to sign two, different, unspents.
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:52:50
And, this misunderstanding is kinda bitcoin-qt's fault.  When you "list unspents" what you actually get is a list of "this is the sum of unspents that can be signed by 1Axx, this is the sum of the unspents that can be signed by 1Bxxx".  Bitcoin-qt, when I last used it, did not allow you to actually specify which unspents you were using, only which address that had unspents you should spend from.  
So, the model is: A transaction has a list of inputs and outputs.  Each input is signed by a private key, and each output can be signed by someone with the private key to the address specified for that particular output.  
An example illustrating the outputs would be "Transaction TX1ABC: output 1: pay 0.2btc to the person who can sign this with 1Axxx, output 2: pay 0.3btc to the person who can sign this with 1Bxxx".  Sometime in the future, you, (who know the private key to 1Axxx), say Hey, lets make a new transaction TX1ABC.  As a part of the /inputs/ to that transaction, you say, not "use up everything from 1Axxx."  What you actually say is Take output 1 from TX1ABC (which was 0.2btc), and spend it.  Here's some proof that I am 1Axxx).  And, you might have some more "unspent outputs" from TX4DEF and TX5CDE that could all be signed by 1Axxx.  But, you didn't list them here.  So, they remain unspent, and in the future, could be spent in similar transactions that say, hey, TX4DEF, output 3, was signable by 1Axxx, let's spend that one now.

You have a physical wallet.  It has two hundred dollar bills in it.  You are under the impression that when you spend any money from the wallet, it all gets moved someplace else.  You spend 80 dollars from the wallet.  This is less than the size of the bill, so what actually happens is that one of the hundred dollar bills stays in the wallet, and 20 comes back to a new wallet.  You think that 120 goes to a new wallet, as a $120 bill.  You throw away the old wallet.  You now have $20 instead of $120.

"A Bitcoin transaction zeroes out the balance at the spending address."  
The only context in which an address has a balance is from within a wallet, separate from the blockchain (i.e. what is reported by bitcoin-qt).  Neither the blockchain nor the protocol have any notion of balance.  
When listing a balance for an address, Bitcoin-qt is reporting the sum of all of the unspent outputs that are able to be signed by a particular private key with that public address (subject to some rules on how long the transactions have been confirmed).  So, in saying "balance" with respect to an address, it sounds like a collection of all of the unspent outputs, not the sum of the outputs that an address signs that are used as inputs to one particular transaction.  Misleading at best, and in the context of "how transactions really work" not accurate at all.

Actually, it's not like your rape context at all.  Perhaps, taking a shower after commiting a rape.  Perhaps even washing your clothes after committing a rape.  But not anything like the rape itself.  There is no direct, second hand, or remote possibility of any harm being done in the transfer of funds itself.  Very much unlike rape.  "Money laundering helps criminals once money is laundered".  So does driving, eating, breathing, bathing, etc.  These are not crimes.  Crimes have victims.  Moving money does not.
Back to your rape example - if you want to compare the laws around money laundering to rape, how about this: you have to submit an "unusual shower request" every time you wash yourself more than once in a day, because, well, you could be trying to destroy evidence.  Perhaps we could monitor your water bills, and make your utility company pay small fines if they don't report unusual spikes in your water bill?

Exactly - and it's not something that much of the bitcoin documentation on the web makes clear.  At its core, bitcoin protocol is about transaction inputs and outputs that can be signed - they're tagged by addresses.  Everyone describing it seems to want to simplify it to "you send coins between addresses", but fundamentally the protocol says these particular inputs, which I have the authority to sign, now belong to these outputs, and here's who has the authority to sign them.  It's not inherently difficult to understand, but there are few comparisons you can make with real world everyday normal money without simplifying to addresses, so a lot of bad analogies get passed around.  This page is a good start to understanding how things work in depth, but even this is a simplification:   Unfortunately, the specificatoin is the code.
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:12:46
Thats how I'd assumed that it worked, and for most people, until they try to do something "interesting", is a great way to protect them from themselves.  Unfortunately, once they get a little bit of knowledge and try to make custom transactions from other wallet software, they tend to get bitten, on account of they didn't know just how much simplification had been done for them.  Ah well, better tools and better education...
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:40:17
Several things to respond to, but the gist is that by omitting the fact that the network relies on transactions and not addresses, you make analogies very difficult to build in an honest and not misleading fashion.  I think all of the issues stem from trying to avoid the ideas of inputs and outputs.  In rereading, it turns out that all of the false statements stem from the claim of "How Bitcoin Transactions Really Work".  Anyway...
 First, some examples of incorrect statements:
1a) "A bitcoin transaction zeroes out the balance at the spending address."  See below as example of how someone might lose coin.
1b) "Any residual balance at the spending address is claimed by the network as a transaction fee." Incorrect, but not dangerous - at least it makes people think twice about claiming their change.  The sum of inputs less the sum of outputs (regardless of spending address) is charged as a fee.
1c) The last paragraph of the how transactions really work section is great until the last sentence, which reinforces this notion of addresses being the important thing on the chain.  Yes, the math and accounting is easier, however, it is not related to addresses, but instead to transaction inputs and outputs.
Second, an example of an intermediate user confusing transaction outputs and address balances:
Confused bitcoiner tells his employer that they should send 1 btc to "1MyOriginalAddress...", and he also tells a craigslist dude that he should send 1 btc to "1MyOriginalAddress..." in order to buy a stereo.  Confusted then decides to buy a new computer for .8BTC.  Confused loads up wallet software, and sends 0.8BTC to "1OverstockCom", and the change back to "1MyChangeAddress".  Now, the amount of that change is only 0.2btc - Confused's wallet was smart and only spent one of my outputs in this transaction.  I he still has 1btc in "1MyOriginal.." and has 0.2 in "1MyChange".  Not paying attention, and because he knows from what he read that 1MyOriginal was supposed to be zeroed out, he stops looking at this wallet.  Maybe stops backing it up.  Anyway, there is still unspent BTC there, and Confused is confused as to why, and it's because they think spending bitcoins means that they're using up addresses, when what's really happening is that they're using up unspent outputs.
In the end, there is a really strong reason to simplify, but the idea that this paints an accurate idea of how transactions really work is misleading.  Perhaps better would be "A simplification of a bitcoin transaction", or else some mention that addresses just sign messages to pay.  Something like "You have to use up an entire message to use it to pay someone, but you don't have to sign all of those messages that you could possibly sign all at once."
Bitcoin is difficult to understand, and simplifying it to analogy to existing systems is prone to come with errors.  As long as those errors are disclaimed with a "it's kinda like, this, but not really, for more, see this link", a simplification doesn't harm much.  But under the guise of being a true representation, only can lead to confusion in the future.

The problem with coinbase is that they are my wallet: I don't control those addresses, and my "send to" addresses get sweeped into their wallet.  This is a transaction from someone I bought bitcoins from to a bitcoin address I control.  If I controlled any of the sending addresses, I would certainly have used a locally generated transaction.  I guess this is the trust problem that we have with banks/fiat.

* edit - it appears you saw the second input - if coinbase waits for 6 confirmations before allowing me to spend bitcoins I've 'deposited', why are they giving me coins from transactions that the best connected nodes haven't even seen yet, let alone confirmed?  Seems kinda scammy to me...

The risk is no different than trading any other asset for bitcoin (such as buying dollars for bitcoins).  This case is interesting, because since both "assets" are kept by the blockchain rather than asymmetrically, you can do either do 3rd party escrow where the third party never handles the assets, or game-theoretical 2 party escrow, options you don't have with cash.

How does this destroy the fungibility of bitcoins?  You can still spend it like any other (but you would be making a mistake).  It's just like your traditional stock certificate happens to be written on the back of a dollar bill.  That bill doesn't lose any value.  Remember, Bitcoin is not foremost a currency - it is a record keeping protocol that happens to also be useful as a currency.

Yeah, usually it won't change by more than a few percent over the course of a transaction.
And if it does, which is rare, it's (historically) more likely to have gone up instead of down.
But if you're really unlucky, China announces something retarded while you are waiting for your transaction confirmation...

At least the miners may have a way to combat greenlists: miners can treat greenlists as blacklists.  Any shop that only takes "clean" coins (breaking the fungibility of bitcoins) never gets to spend them.

Colored coins and "bad useless coins" are very different.  The uproar was over "blacklisted" or "greenlisted" coins, which are both totally different concepts from "colored coins".  Blacklisting and greenlisting are subsets of the general idea of colored coins.  The big idea with colored coins in general is that they enable smart property and contracts.  
For example: a company wishes to sell stock to investors, who will later receive dividends in proportion to the amount of stock they bought.  Let's assume that the company wishes to sell 100 million units of stock.  In order to implement this sale with colored coins, the company first buys 1 bitcoin and sends it to one address that they control.  Next, the company issues a statement that every year, they will split up their profit and pay out cash to anyone who can prove that they own a portion of that bitcoin - this ownership can easily be verified through the blockchain.  So, the company starts up an auction for parts of this bitcoin.  You, an investor, wish to buy 100 of the 100 million shares of the company.  You put up your money, and then the company sends you 100 satoshi from the address that they designated as special.  Now, you've got an address that has those 100 satoshi as an input. Whenever the company goes to pay a dividend, they go out and look at the blockchain and see where their one bitcoin ended up, and pay out some bitcoins to the addresses that own portions of that original bitcoin.  Now, lets say you want to sell your "stock".  All you need to do is make a transaction that uses that original 100 satoshi output as an input, and send it to someone.  You've just transferred ownership of that stock with no broker.

In California financial code:
2003.o: 
" "Money transmission" means any of the following:
   (1) Selling or issuing payment instruments.
   (2) Selling or issuing stored value.
   (3) Receiving money for transmission."
further, 2003.s:
"Receiving money for transmission" or "money received for
transmission" means receiving money or monetary value in the United
States for transmission within or outside the United States by
electronic or other means. The term does not include sale or issuance
of payment instruments and stored value.
further: 2003.m:
"Monetary value" means a medium of exchange, whether or not
redeemable in money.
finally: 2030.  (a) 
"A person shall not engage in the business of money
transmission in this state, or advertise, solicit, or hold itself out
as providing money transmission in this state, unless the person is
licensed or exempt from licensure under this division or is an agent
of a person licensed or exempt from licensure under this division."
From that, it sounds like the state of California could make a pretty good case to go after bitcointip if they so chose...
