@_date: 2017-12-19 12:17:41
No 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:50:33
Majority of ppl in btc are not investors
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:18:41
Its actually 92.3%
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:49:51
then he would be paying a huge amount of tax

@_date: 2017-12-16 23:45:31
That tells me people are over invested
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:56:01
I agree but this one chose us
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:39:49
Very low maintenance 
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:07:53
The one on the right costs me more than 'some bitcoin' haha
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:11:19
Nex on tge neo platform?
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:16:38
Hard to say
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:36:26
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:51:18
If you're right expect a correction because no banks will buy at ATHs
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:28:33
I agree
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:53:38
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:37:18
You dont think itll hit 8k usd?
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:43:54
No no dont do that 
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:34:58
Isnt this what substratum addresses??
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:35:35
Its a big thing aparently
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:03:04
Max 20k min 5k
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:30:48
New? Thats no correction. You'll know when it happens because you'll feel sick 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:21:50
If you have time can you explain in more detail? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:37:45
Its not good
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:59:44
Look into substratum
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:28:17

@_date: 2017-12-19 07:06:26
NEO has the right idea
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:25:19
 Sorry to hear you experienced that
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:49:39
Im worried about this... price starts to drop. People that bought at ATHs start selling to minimise loses. Investors see the change in the market and take profits. Weak hands sell. Price drops more. Panic sellers come in. Institutions and smart money pick up btc at 50%-70% off. Market stabilises for a few months. Then 50k next year. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:43:01
Heres the best piece of advice you're going to get... dont do it. Buy and hold xxx
@_date: 2018-05-26 01:25:44
They never closed any of my accounts
@_date: 2018-06-08 00:23:16
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:45:03
@_date: 2018-06-07 18:15:56
No... No it wont

Crack a beer
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:57:32
Dump everything in asap if you plan to hold long term when we've hit ATH? Each to their own strategy I guess 
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:39:24
Coinspot but theyll smash you with fees
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:14:31
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:34:30
10k by jan/feb... 5k in the next couple of weeks. My opinion
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:51:34
Its not even 1% of btc value
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:33:09
Unless you're dollar cost averaging 
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:45:03
Bitcoin will correct. Some predict to the old supoort of $5k and possibly lower. I agree somewhat with this and think the best time to accumulate will be christmas/holiday time when a lot of people pull profits. Then I think we head to $10k q1 or q2 of next year. Truth is no one knows
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:11:50
Best approach...
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:08:38
Dont call me names, or my bcash, it's disrespectful �� don't do it... ��
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:12:10
I'll bring it up at our next poker game 
@_date: 2019-04-10 07:24:44
I invested in my personal relationship
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:30:37
Thats terrible advice, it will go down... then up... then down... then up... its at ATHs right now be patient
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:50:30
Its never been 8 - 10k and wont be for awhile
@_date: 2019-04-10 17:59:50
@_date: 2019-04-10 07:38:16
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-04-10 07:55:21
Thanks man
@_date: 2019-04-10 17:56:18
My goal is to stir up interest in cryptocurrency... I'm no marketing genius but if this does manage to get on the front page of reddit. It does get people interested.
@_date: 2019-04-10 07:16:35
Thank you
@_date: 2019-04-10 07:37:07
The type of girl I'm with wants us to invest the money we would spend on a wedding into an investment property. She didn't want an expensive ring, but her attitude and how supportive she is made me think she was worth something expensive.
@_date: 2019-04-10 07:18:02
I'm not sure how it will work, never bartered anything before. I know it's going to sting me somewhere.
@_date: 2019-04-10 17:50:50
I'm constantly buying my man...
@_date: 2019-04-10 07:15:10
Lol thanks man
@_date: 2019-04-10 07:24:05
That's what its about... I posted to show people the great things that can come from crypto.
I posted in another subreddit earlier and they removed it... too FB I guess
@_date: 2019-04-10 07:56:35
Yes but my entry point was almost 10 years ago
@_date: 2019-04-11 03:32:27
She is from Sydney... lol
@_date: 2019-04-10 18:02:50
Exactly what we are experiencing and she is soo happy... been though it too?
@_date: 2019-04-10 07:57:13
Thank you
@_date: 2019-04-10 07:29:08
A space that emphasises the importance of decentralization... really
@_date: 2019-04-10 07:13:54
I'm well aware haha. Thinking the crypto industry should hire the same team
@_date: 2019-04-11 02:38:41
Haha stay tuned
@_date: 2019-04-10 17:48:57
@_date: 2019-04-10 07:16:07
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-04-10 07:19:53
Traded. It was easy this time because his son is into crypto.
@_date: 2019-04-10 17:57:57
It'll be a great story lol... provided we do well. Otherwise may be slightly painful
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:42:20
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:06:27
