Buy, then send. The place where you buy will have a wallet on their site that they will be on until you send to your own. Most suggest not leaving the coins on the site because they may be hacked or run with your money (see Mt.Gox).

Not sure of your mathematics background, but if you have taken a course on statistics or probability i suggest trying to read the original white paper. Its really not that complicated and has so many interesting consequences

If you care about bitcoin and the technology going further, pay your damn taxes. Gov’t will be much less inclined to embrace blockchain if we don’t pay the correct taxes on it.

If more than half the hash rate did it, nothing we can really so. But thats the whole idea of the decentralization, its REALLY not likely that that many people conspire to one malicious plan. And if they did we could just turn on our own miners to fight back

Block time is a consequence of the difficulty. For a miner to lower their difficulty they would need to change the encryption, or find a way to outpace the majority of other miners. The first cant work because no one would accept the blocks that were encrypted different than all others (this would effectively be a one miner hardfork). And the second would draw LARGE attention and then cause a huge difficulty raise upon the next difficulty adjustment.
TL;DR:   You don’t get to “choose” the block time for your miner, the math of probability and the large number of miners sets the average block time.

Possible? Sure. Something to worry about? No. This is the equivalent of a bank faking transactions except the customers of the bank are the employees so we could just go back an take over again.

It’s taxed like property, you purchased X amount of property (bitcoin) and when you sell it you will owe capital gains tax. Not sure about writing the principle off

These premined blocks would have to continue to infinity because any honest block after that would use the premined hash, which wouldn’t be verified by the whole network and are invalid.

For limit orders!!! Not market orders be careful!

Oh i misread maker as market, my bad :)
