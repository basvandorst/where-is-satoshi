I've seen more people tossing out 3k but experienced traders are not that pessimistic. The floor is near when all the absurd targets are thrown out as possible and my friends call up worried about 3k. And that has already happened. But hey we still might be lucky for a 9k run.

If you think making a blocksize decision is hard for the bitcoin community, we are in a world of hurt to try to change the mining algorithm. Proof of stake or hybrid stake mining is for alt-coins for the foreseeable future.

If you are going to use his reasoning that dash is not suitable for venezuelans only because it is more volatile than bitcoin. Then USD is better than bitcoin, especially recently. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:41:43
General sentiment is that the current financial industry uses way more power and if you don't like the power usage then don't buy bitcoin. Chances of anyone volunteering to use more expensive energy is zero.

Bitcoin will never have paid nodes which are usually called masternodes. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:51:39
Marketcap is no longer a good indicator of the quality of a coin. Generally marketcap and number of trading pairs/exchanges would be slightly better. Usually a coin that isn't at it's all time high against bitcoin is a better choice too.

Good luck trying to get people to put down money for something like this. Better off with a coin like Dash that has a treasury budget for funding things. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 09:14:57
I thought success was based on low fees. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 19:39:44
The kill switch thing is fake news. Also you cant compound masternode earnings because masternodes need 1000 and are fixed payout, any number above 1000 in a wallet does not increase payout. You should've bought a masternode when dash was $3.

Anyone providing any counterargument was down-voted by trolls. Do you really expect users to understand a line of code. If the spork is activated, it starts a re-scan on the specified number of blocks. Without new rules! This will eliminate accidental network forks and activate longest chain. The chain with 51% of the hash-power is the longest chain. It is no different then all PoW cryptos. This is a cleanup mechanism in the case of a unintentional fork where say 20% of the network starts bugging out due to a feature. The longest chain always applies. People who think a you can change past transactions have no fundamental understanding of blockchain. That requires a code change like with every other crypto and majority mining power.

Show me the txid's or it didn't happen.
@_date: 2018-06-07 21:35:55
Turning a feature off is different then turning the blockchain off. It's only effective if masternodes decide to allow that signal. They could decide to turn it back on regardless of what core did. It prevents a immediate code fork that would be required if a exploit was found on most other coins. It also removes the amount of time a exploiter could cause damage. A lot of coins are adding this sort of thing to their layer two code.  
@_date: 2018-06-08 01:06:58
Its something like 13~ years to earn a masternode but rewards drop every year so its probably longer. 
@_date: 2019-06-11 22:34:16
Yeah, not sure why anyone would pay more.
@_date: 2019-06-11 22:46:10
If you want to be guaranteed to be included in the next block then it's best to overestimate. Underestimating or missing the block may annoy the customer more.

They seem to be on top of support. I had a very quick response to a issue. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 17:39:08
what was the fee.
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:22:42
Yeah, they don't do a good enough job of showing how capitalism and government regulation together is why capitalism fails.

Fairly soon the number of coinbase users will pass the number of available bitcoin.

We should force amazon to take a profit instead of reinvesting the money in their business. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:00:46
Agreed. Bitcoin's value is not in the community, its just the raw strength of a lot of stubborn people and a resistant to change. There is value in that too.
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:43:28
Seems to work for most people buying BTC.
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:04:02
at least they didn't give you 5 new accounts you didn't know about.. lol
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:04:19
He looks at it from a very pragmatic way. There are many sources of value created by these networks. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 16:11:23
I'm still confused how someone goes to the bank to do a wire transfer and gets a ACH. With 200k you think you would know what you are doing.

This has never been a sub to learn from much. It's more entertainment for the last couple years. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:53:25
Yeah sometimes we don't get a perfect world that makes since.  Very of you. It's good that we now have permissionless value. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:39:54
Buying ETH at $8 is such snake oil lol...
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:56:07
Betting against bitcoin is always a bad idea. You sound like a holder anyway.
@_date: 2017-07-13 02:46:56
good thing only 802 people sold bitcoin in 2015

I see his problem, he uses BoFA. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:08:19
Some people would say sidechains break the original vision of bitcoin. So breaking doesn't always mean hacking.

Quick tl;dr, Omar runs Crypt0's News on YouTube with over 21k subscribers. He has been doing youtube videos for over a year and has recently been doing this full time. So on his flight back Coindesk reaches out to him to pay a license fee for the Consensus 2017 Videos. 
* He responds immediately to coindesk and setup a time to talk next morning.
* Flight is delayed 6hrs, Omar emails asking to reschedule. 
* Coindesk emails him to delete all videos, instead of rescheduling.
* Omar goes to remove video, already received a copyright strike
* Omar loses ability to live stream for 3 months. 
His account is more infuriating as he was trying to do the right thing. He was not able to find any terms on any literature that said recording was not allowed. Please support his channel, he has some great interviews and is providing a service to the community.

Are you being sarcastic?
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:46:05
Yeah screw me for holding BTC lol. And buying more, happily when it goes down.

And  you obviously missed out on something otherwise you wouldn't be raging here.
