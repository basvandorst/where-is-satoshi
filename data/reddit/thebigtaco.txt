I'll tell you what, PM me your Adress and I'll mail you a paper wallet with a bag to keep it safe and some holographic stickers to make sure no one is acessing them.

So in my opinion their are two safe ways to store your bitcoin. One as said is to use a paper wallet, for which you need a printer, something you don't have. This isn't my prefered method because I don't like having something that screams**BITCOIN** right across the top.
The second method is called electrum. Electrum is a seed based program, which means that it will give you twelve completley random words that you can use to acess all of your bitcoin, even if you destroy the hard drive. It also has this thing called a Master Public key which will let you deposit and see your balance but no let you withdraw. My favorite book on how to do this is called [Total Bitcoin Security]( and while the book is paid, check your PM and their might just be a little present for you(If you don't know you can access your PM by the envelope by your name in the top right). The method this book uses requires two USB's and a piece of paper so as long as you have that, you will have bitcoin's that nobody but you will be able to access but yourself. 
I would suggest to hide your seed in a story or maybe encrypt it/ ask your parents to put a copy in their Saftey Deposit Box.
Good luck and feel free to ask any questions.

Tip Jar?

Or you can use Electrum, which will generate a practically infinite amount of QR codes for you, so you can very easily get a new one every day.

I am also surprised that an "adult" doesn't trust herself to be able to have a skype call with someone without having her identity stolen. I doesn't need to even be a call, just text.

Yes, Their is.


So someone with no phone and no experience with 2fa is giving advice on bitcoin? I won't try and teach football because I've never played football. When your in my league and you finally learn how to use bitcoin properly and not have:


Nice description "the api key thing". You can't even keep your own fucking btc safe and are now telling others how to do it. Get a life.

Hello, 
Also your age and would consider myself to have more bit pin knowledge than the average bitcoin user. 
A nice place for the very beginner user is trybtc.com
This website lets you get a hold on BTC and even allows you to get a hole on 2 or 3 uBTC(ALL FOR FREE).
In addition this video  is what I found does the best job a explaining BTC in depth for if you would like to truly understand bitcoin.
I know that both of us are quite young, but if you manage to get a hold on some bitcoin, I would look into using electrum along with a Ubuntu USB to keep your bitcoins safe, this is even the method that I use to store my bitcoins. 
If you give me a tip jar(this is a public address that you have possession of that let's other people give you BTC but not take it ) then I will be more than happy to give you some BTC for you to work with(nothing crazy). 
My number one suggestion is to find a very safe way to store your BTC as to not get them stolen.
Also Butterfly Labs along with many other miner manufacturers are scams, and Paul Krugmans are anti-bitcoiners(the opposite of you and me!) Good luck on your BTC venture and post a comment if you have any more questions!

Buddy I don't know what kind of parent
A)Limit the child's technology to the point where they can't print a piece of paper, or get access to a USB
B)After preventing the child in this way doesn't allow him to go around these artificial limitations that they have set because of their personal lack of  knowledge, by receiving a piece of post from a person who from the beginning of this thread has tried to help you. 
While I try to believe that your situation is sincere, I find it strange that every method that i Have attempted to use to help you has been denied by you with a fairly week excuse. To be honest, I would have given myself your address if I was you and inconspicuously picked up the mail without my parents noticing. It is ridiculous that your parents limit your access to the post, as you are a member of the household just as they are and have the same right as they to use the mailbox. 
Also, I believe that you are from the UK(considering you said "mum" and not mom" and I am from the states so I doubt I would buy plane tickets to England or Ireland or Scotland to stalk some random 13 year old from the internet.
If you really are who you say you are then show me that you are willing to cooperate.
Even more convincing would be a Picture with your Username(a PM is fine as their is no reason for everyone to know who you are).
I think it is ridiculous that your Mother controls you in such fashions.
Do you have to go through her to buy deodorant, razors, or even more embarrisingly, condoms or if you ever decide to truly venture, drugs. Please, figure out a way to live your life that doesn't sole require Mommey and Daddy for anything you need. I would be more than please to have a conversation with your parents to explain the situation to them.

She can't talk with me?
@_date: 2014-01-08 02:11:11
Sorry to hear about your Dad.
But about your mom. First of all I'm kind of curious how she monitors to know that your face is never on the internet. Second, unless you are a modern Boo Radley, I find i t ridiculous of her to think that your picture has never touched the internet.  208,300 photos uploaded every minute to Facebook and somehow your face isn't in one of them. This isn't to mention surveillance cameras, CCTV, or mobile pictures or videos that have been taken that could contain your image, and just as easily you voice. How would she even know if you had a Skype call as those aren't recorded or moniterd.
Personally I would have said "Fuck You" and done and posted anything I want on the internet. Once again, I am more than willing to talk with your mother.

I find it interesting that a 13 year old bitcoin nube is giving who claimed to lose his money on coinbase is [giving advice to people on how to use coinbase.](
@_date: 2014-01-08 02:15:31
Still, is against her policy to talk with me? Also a estimate for the total amount of Pics ever taken is 3.8 trillion, so to think that their is not a single photo of you that is not in your possession is absurd.

I play water polo at an outdoor pool with practices from 7-9, no matter what the weather is.(I live in Bellevue as well). Let me tell you, it is a different level of cold when you are in sub 0^o C temperatures in a spedoo

In addition, an explanation on how the Bitcoin.wallet file works would be great
EDIT:Pressed enter to early. Woops

I was thinking of doing something along the lines of [this tutorial]( to create a wallet on my harddrive, and then using a [website like this]( to create a password to encrypt the Wallet. Would this work?

Twist: They announce that by the time everyone finishes reading their announcement, any money they held at blockchain.info has disappear.
