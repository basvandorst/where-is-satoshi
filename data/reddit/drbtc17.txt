I fucking love this site! I've been using this site for all my stickers and swag! They are amazing. The stickers are really high quality, I've had them on my laptops and car for over 2 years now and still look brand new. They have new stuff every week too! I've honestly spent a good thousand+ on this site. They just have really good high quality stuff at good prices! They recently just started this donating thing and I thought it was the best idea they have had so far. Granted I spend more money on stuff now that this is in place, but it's totally worth every penny of it. Awesome swag + supporting the projects too it's a real win win for everyone! I can go on and on about how awesome this site is!

You should look at BitPay free small business account for accepting bitcoins. They have same day bank deposits if I remember correctly. Or try CoinBase for selling your coins easily with bank deposits. Or if you want to sell the coins quick and over market pro r do localbitcoins. You can have people deposit money into your bank account and when they do you confirm it and then localbitcoins releases the coins. But if you do that you need to make sure they upload picture of the receipt for the deposit and check online to see if the deposit is legit as a extra safety measure/making sure. Most places take 3-5 days for bank deposit. So it's really up too you.

Yes they do indeed offer dedicated servers. Here are some direct links to see more info on pricing and bandwidth. You can also go into a live chat with either the support or the sales teams to find out any info or questions you might have about there services. They do work with people on pricing for there services they have. So if you don't need a super powerful server, you can have a custom built server for your needs and priced accordingly. Let me know if you have any questions or need any help. I'll be more then happy to help answer any questions you might have or if you need assistance with their services.

You don't think a email is personal information? A email is still linked to you &amp; your personal information. Granted you could use a disposable email or make a anonymous email to make a account. But why go thru all that, just to trade coins? If I'm gong to do that I might as well just use an exchange to trade cryptos. The whole point of ShapeShift is to be able to trade coins without making an account. This site is nice and all but ShapeShift is still king.
@_date: 2016-04-19 02:16:40
Oh woah you guys have a Reddit account!? Wasn't expecting that! Your guys are awesome! Keep up the awesome work! If you need a model or someone to promote swag I'll be more then happy to help! :)

This literally defeats the whole purpose... If I have to sign up to use it, I might as well just sign up for a exchange and get a better trade rate. This is nothing like ShapeShift at all. The site does look nice and all but the sign up just ruins everything.. Hopefully ShapeShift will be back online soon.
@_date: 2016-04-06 02:33:39
I'm not quite sure I understand what you mean? Please elaborate. Thanks! 
@_date: 2016-04-13 17:20:13
Here's how I would do it...
Buy Bitcoins.
Make a paper wallet.
Send the coins you just bought to the paper wallet.
Then send the coins from the paper wallet to another wallet like Bitcoin-QT or Mycelium/CoPay.
Then Use ShapeShift to trade the bitcoin for Litecoin or Đogecoin or Dash.
Then trade the coins back to bitcoin. 
Then send to the DarkMarket. 
This way the coins are a lot harder to trace back to its origin due to switching from one crypto to another.
@_date: 2016-04-06 07:49:07
I hope this doesn't happen! This is great for the bitcoin community and will most definitely get more people's attention and curiosity as to what the application is. So hopefully it will draw more people into the community. 
@_date: 2016-04-06 02:32:39
I personally only use Circle Pay to buy/sell my coins when needed. Their services are amazing tho, especially customer support. But I don't hold coins in there unless I just bought or am going to sell.
(OFF TOPIC)
But thank you very much kind stranger for the one day of Reddit gold! Funny thing is, Reddit itself just gave me 4 years of Reddit gold for purchasing the pro version on the Reddit Alien Blue App... But the thing is, I never actually purchased it. Reddit was giving away the pro version in-app purchase for free for the first week of its release. So now I have 4 years and 1 day of Reddit gold lol. So now I have a lot of gold to giveaway :)

Cloud mining isn't worth it. It would honestly be better to buy bitcoins with the money you would spend on cloud mining. You would probably make more money that way. Or buy a 100GH miner and join a pool. I wouldn't invest in cloud mining if I were you IMO. It's just not worth it.

I don't see anything about the iOS wallet version? What am I missing? 
@_date: 2016-04-06 02:43:31
Are you talking about bitcoin faucet applications? Because there are dozens of them on both iOS &amp; Android. Is this what you are talking about? If so, I can make a post with all the iOS applications that give free bitcoins.

HostDime takes bitcoin for there services. They have dozens of data centers and great customer support &amp; reliable service. Let me know if you have any questions or need any help.

Yes you can buy/sell/trade with only a iPhone using applications. Now here are some applications to help you get started.
CoinBase or Cex.Io -- Applications to Buy/Sell Bitcoin.
Bread Wallet -- Secure Bitcoin Wallet To Store Your Coins.
ShapeShift or Evercoin -- Trade bitcoin for other cryptocurrency.
Hopefully this helps you out to get started with Bitcoin on iPhone.
@_date: 2016-04-05 05:59:17
For mobile I use circle for buying and selling. Then CoPay &amp; Bread Wallet for Holding my spending coins. Then paper wallets for long term storage.

Have you tired restarting your iOS device after downloading the application to clear RAM cache? Sometimes that helps with apps crashing in general. Also what version of iOS are you running and on what device model? And what version of the BlockChain app are you running? If you need help finding this info let me know and I'll be more then happy to help you out. iOS is my specialty.
Edit: Also is your device jailbroken? How did you find the .plist file? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:58:56
Yes coinbase is a safe way to purchase and store cryptocurrencies. They are insured and have a easy, user friendly application to purchase and store your coins. Just remember they are a web wallet so you technically don't own the coins, because they hold your private keys. But you can send your coins to another wallet that you have full control over. And remember to use a strong password and enable 2-Factor Authentication. To make sure you account is secure and protected, just in case someone does get your password, your account is still secured by the 2-Factor code. It's just a simple and easy way to secure your account by adding a extra layer of security.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:32:20
No it's never to late to invest into bitcoin. But I would also invest in other alt cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 23:03:00
The Copay wallet is amazing! I've been a beta tester since day one and it's definitely come a long way from the first beta. It's definitely a wallet I would recommend to anyone who uses bitcoin.

I think apples new payment system will be great for bitcoin!
If the new iOS device line up does include NFC think about how much faster bitcoin transactions will be at retailers. No more scanning QR codes! Just a tap and go process. Now all someone has to do is build a new app to support it and current bitcoin apps will just add it on! It will be a good thing for bitcoin making it more smooth for transactions then they already are.

I am not sure on anything mycelium. I just seen it browsing the app store and decided to post here. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 17:50:26
Ive actually only used my CC to buy coins a few times. I mostly buy with bank account cause of the no fees. And those are what my instant limits went up too for my weekly buys. I can now buy up to $1000 on my CC every week instantly and up to $2,500 every week instantly with my bank account. I wonder if it's based on how much you buy every day/week. As I buy about a half/whole coin every week, sometimes more depending on what I'm doing and how much I have to spend on bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 05:06:55
Actually I think it depends on how much you buy and how often. I got a bump up from them a few months ago and mine was larger then this. Here is what they bumped me too. CC $500 &gt; $1000 Bank $1000 &gt; $2500

They are indeed active and I believe it's only the two guys still running cardforcoin &amp; there other service Fold. So they do have a lot on there plates to handle and take care of. Just be patient and keep trying to get a hold of them. They will eventually get to you. I admit they are slow, but two people can only do so much! I remember having issues the first time I used them, but they did eventually get back to me and paid me out for my gift card. I remember posting on your last post about how it took them almost 6 months to pay me out. You will get paid out eventually. Just keep trying and you will get a response back soon. They do need to make a automated system or hire more people to handle these type of situations. I myself would be more than willing to help them build a automated system or be a remote worker to help them out &amp; handle these types of situations. But you have not been scammed or duped out of your gift card or money owed.

I know Apple did say there was a issue with there search algorithms. Which is most likely why it's showing Google wallet as the first result. Because if you just search the term "wallet" it will show Google wallet as the first result. So this is the reason why. But if you just search bitcoin it will show all the bitcoin apps and wallets.

I would look into BitPay's new bitcoin debt card that they just released a little while ago. I think it's one of the best/better bitcoin debt cards on the market currently IMO. It has instant bitcoin deposits to the card, ATM withdraw, low/no fees depending on the use. It's also a Visa, so it's accepted pretty much everywhere and is legal in most if not all of the U.S. 
@_date: 2016-06-19 18:44:25
It's showing up in the AppStore for me when I search for it. But definitely write down your backup phrase and store it in multiple places just incase. But since it's open source you can build and install from source on mac using Xcode and side load it with a free developer account. So even if it does get pulled for whatever reason you can still install and use it.

Just take the Bitcoin address you sent the coins to and look it up on blockchain.info . Also how did you send the coins to that wallet? Bitcoin-QT? MyCelium? Other wallet application? Did you pay a fee when sending the coins? If you didn't pay a fee when sending your coins, that could be the issue and it will take a lot longer to receive the coins you sent, due to it taking longer then normal to verify the transaction. Let me know if you need any help or have any questions. I'll be more then happy to help you out.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:31:45
It's not a stock. Investment, most definitely. But it is most certainly an alternative digital currency.
@_date: 2016-02-10 07:56:50
For now it is only available on iOS devices, but the developer did say a android version is coming soon. Once it fixes some of the bugs and spoofing techniques, hacking, mods etc to prevent abuse and to keep it fair for all users to collect drops. 
@_date: 2016-02-28 07:22:25
I believe that they are still indeed active. I posted here a while back about having the same issue, you are having. There support is a little slow and do take a while to get back to you. But they will get back to you sometime soon. And once they do get back to you, they usually bend over backwards to help you out if there are any issues. When I first used them I thought I was never going to get paid out and was going to be out of my gift card cause they took the money off it way before I ever got paid out. But in the end of things I honestly thought that I was never ever going to use there services ever again. Due to how long it took to get paid out. Just for a $10 target gift card... But after everything I went thru and what they did for me on a personal level. Made me give them a second chance and have used them multiple times. In the end of everything, I ended up getting $40 worth of bitcoin, on top of the $8 in bitcoin for the gift card. So pretty much $50 in bitcoin for the gift card and troubles and personal apology emails from both the CEO &amp; COO. So don't freak out if it's taking so long, they will get to you and give you your coins or card back, depending on your choice.

I love the Takara app! I started doing the free bitcoin faucets again and have all my coins sent to my Takara wallet for drops. One thing I did notice is when you tap on a drop and see the dollar value of the drop, there is a comma instead of a period. Which made one of my friends think that most of the drops were thousands of dollars... So I think that should be changed to a period avoid confusion with new bitcoiners. I also have a bunch of ideas/features I would love to see integrated into Future releases of Takara. I have many more ideas/features if you would like to PM me for them or need help with developing the application. Let me know what you think! Keep up the awesome work!!! 
1: Game of Birds &amp;amp; Sarutobi Tips Directly Sent To Takara Wallet. 
2: Custom Drop Amounts/More Drop Amount Options. For Example, 5,000 bits, 15,000 bits, 13,370 bits etc.
3: Leaderboards To See What Users Have Dropped The Most Takara. 
4: Tips/Rewards For User's Who Make Lots of Drops. Or Some Type Of Tips/Rewards For User's In The Top Of The Leaderboards.
5: Challenges/Competitions For Takara Uses For Tips/Rewards or Bragging Rights etc.
6: Adding Ads or Tasks To Takara With The Option For Users To Opt-In or Out, For Users To Get Bitcoin Tips For Users To Make Drops or Keep.
7: Custom User Profiles, like profile pic, bio, etc. 
8: Badges/Banners For Users To Collect &amp;amp; To Show Off. For Example, a Badge For Making 5 Drops, Or a Badge For Collecting Drops etc etc.
9: Auto/Random Drops. For Example, So Say I Wanted To Make A Random Drop Not At My Current Location. The App Would Make A Drop In A Random Location(s). Or The Ability To Make Auto Drops At A Set Time or Locations.
10: The Ability For Takara Users To Pay A Small Tip/Donation For A Try Or Two To Collect Drops In Other Locations.
11: The Ability To Message Users, As Well As The Ability To Message The User(s) Who Collects Your Drops.
12: Notifications For New Drops In Your Area/Set Miles Away Or Radius/Current Location &amp;amp; Notifications If Your Near A Drop, Etc.
13: The Ability To Drop Takara Near A User(s) of choice, Without Knowing The Other User's Location.
14: A Friends List, Where You Can Add Other Takara Users To Your Friends List &amp;amp; Get Notifications If They Drop Any Takara Or The Ability Drop Or Tip Takara Near/To Your Friends. As Well As The Ability To Message Friends Or Start A Chat With Friends etc.
15: A Takara Pot, Where People Donate Bitcoin Or View Ads or Tasks To Do To Add Bitcoin Into The Pot. So Then When The Pot Has Bitcoin In It, The App Will Drop The Bitcoin From The Pot In Locations Where Not Many Drops Are or At Random Drops In Random Places/Locations.
16: Pin Code/Touch ID For Extra Security.
17: ShapeShift Integration To Swap Coins When Cashing Out From Wallet.
18: Other CryptoCurrency Drops Besides Bitcoin. Like Litecoin, Dogecoin, Dash, Gems, NuBits, ShadowCash Etc.

Yeah if I were you I would pay off your debt and if you have any money left over to buy some bitcoin. I would dump ask your money into bitcoin either. I would do more like 20-40% into bitcoin and most into a savings account or a CD if they even still have those.

Weusecoins is a great website for info on using Bitcoin. As far as using the actual Bitcoin core application just look up some videos on YouTube or Google.

I agree. Windowz is a pain in the ass sometimes. Much better to run a Unix based system like Linux or Mac. Just cause of the security. Don't get me wrong they have there security problems too but not as much as Windows does. I would look up maybe looking how to do it via PowerShell instead as the commands might be easier then command prompt.
@_date: 2015-04-08 01:29:54

@_date: 2015-09-02 05:50:22
That's why you make multiple backups of your private key(s) and wallet passphrase. Write them down on multiple sheets of paper, print them out, copy them to a text file and put the text file into a folder and encrypt the folder with a strong passphrase, then take the encrypted folder and throw it onto a few USB sticks and then encrypt the USB sticks for a extra precaution. Just remember the passphrase you used to encrypt the folder and USB sticks. 
Or you can use something like KeyPass and make a database with all your private key(s) and wallet passphrase and then take the KeyPass DB and throw it on a few USB sticks and encrypt the USB sticks. So then all you would have to do is remember or write down the passphrase for the DB and USB. 
I know I made it seem a bit confusing and sounds complicated, but it's really not that complicated at all.
@_date: 2015-09-01 08:38:01
Are you looking for a desktop or mobile wallet? 
For desktop I would go with the Bitcoin-QT application Or Copay by Bitpay application for desktop/laptop all the way.  
As for mobile I would recommend Copay application by Bitpay. It's a solid wallet that's really easy to use and secure, with lots of features like multisig and more. As well as, you own your private keys. Plus it is open source. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 06:02:34
If your looking for something on the web I would go with Circle, they have great customer service and your coins are insured up to a certain amount. It's a solid web wallet with a good amount of features like two factor, backup email account, just in case something happens to one email account. You can still use the other to verify its you. Then you can access your wallet and coins from anywhere with Internet and a web browser. You can also download their mobile apps for iOS and Android. Plus you can also buy more coins with a credit/debit card or bank account instantly with Circle. Just remember that you don't own your coins with most web wallets, they do. Like the guy above said, it's pretty much a IOU kinda deal.
I would also recommend CoinKite, they have a really great reputation and is also a really great web wallet service. 
But if your not looking to spend your coins and just want a safe place to keep them, I would highly recommend just making a offline paper wallet using a live OS like a live Debian CD/USB or Tails CD/USB.

Man that fucking sucks they locked your account with your funds. Use a local wallet on your computer or a bootable flash drive. Here's what I do. You should contact them and see what they can do about closing your account at least. And if they say they can't close your account and delete your info they are lying. You tell them look you run these commands on your servers and like magic the data is gone! 
Here's what I do which I recommend you do if you still want to use Bitcoin.
I use circle wallet to buy/sell coins (Mostly buy).
So to use some other exchange like SnapCard or BTC-e to buy your coins.
I use a local Bitcoin app that can generate the wallet keys without any type of connection (like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth etc)on my phone so this way you can copy the keys without them being compromised by any MIM attacks etc and use that as a hot wallet for on the go Bitcoin stuff.
 Don't have to have a wallet on your phone, only if you want to have something on the go.
I use the Bitcoin-qt on my laptop for storing coins that I want to spend.
I would recommend downloading Bitcoin-qt or something similar for storing your coins if you wanna send coins to people/make purchases or receive coins.
Then have my CryptoCards (paper wallets) for savings.
You don't need to a paper wallet but they are much much more secure then a computer wallet by any means. 
Good luck trying to get your coins back!

You can run a node off of pretty much anything now a days. Like the new Raspberry Pi 2 Model B. Or you could build a cheap computer and make it into a node or build a server or rent a sever/VPS and make a node. There's tons of ways to do it. It more a less comes down to what exactly do you want out of your node? Do you want it so it can handle thousands of connections or just a few? Do you want to be cheap as possible or build a super node and throw down a bunch of money. It just all depends on what you are trying to accomplish. 
If you want to just run a node to help out the network just buy a Raspberry Pi or a VPS packages from a hosting company and do it that way.

It doesn't bother me. That just means more coins for less cash lol I love these low prices!

I would go with BitWallet or CoPay hands down. You can import keys offline and you still control everything about the wallet. Plus they do have some good security mechanisms in place. Coinomi isn't available for iOS yet, but it will be available soon. Beta testing for Coinomi on iOS will be starting in the coming weeks. If you have any questions please feel free to hit me up. I'll be more then happy to help assist you in anyway.

I sent in a request for a popular bank thats not on the list. I also requested if you guys could add Circle as a option as well. Thanks again for all the information! And thank you for the beta invite!

I thought that's how you are supposed to property type with a double space at the beginning of each new paragraph? At least that's what I was taught in English and computer class, as it is "proper" indentation.

I just sent you a PM. I might have the d0x on this person.
@_date: 2015-03-24 15:17:38
I haven't checked to see if my bank supports it yet. But I hope they do! 
@_date: 2016-05-23 18:55:30
It depends on your bank and what day you cashed it out. If I cash out on a Monday before 5PM, I will get the money in my bank account it 2-3 days. Cex.io now has instant withdraws to cards.
@_date: 2015-03-19 15:19:58
I'll take one if your still got any left!

I recently just gave my co worker a paper wallet with $10 in Bitcoin on it for his birthday and showed him how to transfer it to his phone and then sent him $5 more to show him how easy it is send and receive Bitcoin on your phone. He was amazed. It was the greatest feeling every now he's more interested in bitcoin then ever. He used it to buy a VPS he wanted and seen how fast the transaction was. Now he is using circle to buy small-medium amounts of bitcoins.

Yeah I only signed up for Xapo just to get the bigger tips. Now I have tons of other people's email address and they have mine. We should all get good size tips for this outrage.  Man fuck this, my email never gets spam and now this shit... My mailbox is going to be filled up with spam in no time.. Thanks for the $0.04 Xapo Tip for the hour it took me to get those black coins and Spam...!

Haha yeah don't get me wrong I hold coins but I do also do buy and sell coins when I need to. If I have bitcoin I'd rather use that to buy stuff then my credit/debt card. I buy coins every week. Trade some for other cryptos and send some to my cold storage wallets for savings and then have some to spend.

Wal-Mart website has butterfly labs bitcoin miners for sale lol.

If I want to bitch about something here about bitcoin I will. Who gives a fuck? Apparently you. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 17:12:39
I thank you for your nice explanation, but I am already aware of these things. I was just bitching for the sake of it. Take a chill pill.

Wow that lady at coinbase really does seem like she cares about these concerns bitcoiners are having with coinbase. If I were you I would take this opportunity to ask her as many questions about coinbase as possible. Don't get me wrong, I would still take that email with a grain of salt
 Just because it does seem kinda like it was a set up email, only cause she did ask you multiple times if you would kindly take down/edit the post. Which kinda makes me believe she was set up to say that.. But if I were you I wouldn't use coinbase or any other web wallet as a main wallet. If you looking for something on the go/mobile I would go with one of the apps that stores the data locally.

That is the best part! Because then I now have more coins to buy for a cheaper price! If anything price drops are a good thing, they teach patience and how to save. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:52:02
I love buying bitcoin, it's so much better then having a debt or credit card. Buying stuff with it is one of the best parts about it. I don't know if it's just me but I also love connecting bitcoins! Now if only more places around me would start accepting bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 14:17:00
I'm not surprised one bit that they did this. It wouldn't be hard to hide the coins. Especially when you have shapeshift to swap coins and tumblers to tumble them. 
@_date: 2016-05-10 15:06:49
Damn BitPay is on a roll. They just keep pumping shit out.
@_date: 2015-02-02 01:06:58
You my friend are one of the reasons why people are getting interested in bitcoin by being introduced with a nice tip. Keep up the good work!
