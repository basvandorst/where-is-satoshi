Multiple offline devices may be overkill, sure, but you should always generate your keys from an offline machine if you want security. You should never trust any device connected to the internet, especially a Windows machine. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:55:24


I never said that. I only said you should generate your wallet offline. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:54:45


No, that's really, really, really being safe and smart with your money.

Transactions don't cost as much as they did.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:46:31
How much was it this time last year? The year before? How much was it 5 years ago?
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:59:07


More important than either of those is decentralization.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:58:53


That's what we were told all through out high school.

F*ck community college, lets get drunk and eat chicken fingers

To be fair, they only have the information one gives them.

You're not storing money in the bank unless you have some physical money in a safe deposit box.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:54:10
It's not over yet.
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:12:17
Ok, pal
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:33:00
And there will always be tumblers that don't care and operate outside the law.
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:50:24
What the fuck are you talking about? The only way Bitcoin will ever be $80 again is if you invent a time machine and go back to 2013.
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:23:04
Or they could send it to a mixer.
@_date: 2018-03-24 17:33:31
Yes, and dragnet surveillance is universally wrong.

He got in late.

Our government has done worse to it's people in the name of stopping terrorism than terrorist could ever do on their own.
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:33:35
Not if I buy them first.
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:44:46
I guess it depends on why you're into bitcoin. If you're just in it for a quick buck then yeah think short term. If you're in it because you believe it's a revolutionary technology then you should think long term. 
But you could be in it for both reasons.

Cash money is not a fiat card. Do you understand what cash money is?
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:54:27
I'm ready to be proved wrong and I'm willing to bet that I won't be, guy!
@_date: 2018-03-13 13:27:26
You can't request a charge back from your bank if you paid in cash money.
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:19:12
Anything is possible. I think the only way Bitcoin ever "fails" is if Bitcoin itself fails. If people can hack, or find a bug or whatever that allows them to create duplicate coins or double spend or something like that it will fail, if the code always works correctly I don't think it will ever fail. Someone will always be willing to buy your Bitcoin as long as there are still people and secure Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:30:01
1 BTC will be worth whatever people are willing to trade it for. What is 1 USD worth?
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:45:08
It's "buy the dip" not "buy the deep". Meaning dip in price.
@_date: 2018-02-21 07:17:53
One of those 4 coins shouldn't be there anyway.
@_date: 2018-03-13 06:12:16


But that removes consumer protection also then? What if after paying my *U.S. cash dollars* I realize whatever product I got doesn't work.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:13:41
But at larger numbers it becomes harder to read quickly.
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:27:45
The next sentence explains what I mean by this statement.
@_date: 2018-03-13 05:47:32
That's just the way she goes.
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:49:25
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:45:08
Bitcoin is dead, long live Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:04:20
Stop thinking short term, revolutionary change takes time.
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:33:11
Yes. I will sell you one Bitcoin for 50k.
@_date: 2018-03-22 06:35:51




Why would I invest in a new coin that no one has ever heard of and has never been widely attacked demonstrating it's resilience?
No thanks.
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:03:42
Are you still buying into this pipe dream that government "backed" fiat will last forever?
@_date: 2018-03-20 11:58:11
If and when Bitcoin "takes off" you won't need to convert to other currencies. 1 Bitcoin will always equal 1 Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-10 20:16:41
Not for them.

Does one need the entire blockchain downloaded to run a lightning node?
