Do you want people to laugh at bitcoin and ridicule bitcoiners? If the answer to that question is ''yes'', please continue spreading ridiculous information like this.

Actually, you can. GoCoin, Snapcard, Coinpayments.  Just to name a few payment processors that allow Litecoin integrtion/acceptance. 
Coinmap showed that Litecoin was accepted at 15% of the places where Bitcoin was accepted. Bitcoin could only dream of the amount that 15% represents when it was as old as Litecoin.

Thanks, another site which I can add to my ''ignore, complete rubbish'' list.

Cryptocurrencies are different though. The ''infrastructure'' already exists and people ''who made it'' are very excited about it. Billions are pumped into the cryptocurrency industry. This is promising. 
You don't need to quit your job to invest/learn about crypto. I also never said that you should quit college. You're just trying to put words into my mouth in order to win an argument. 
Going to college = taking a chance at something. Something that has, historically, provided some insurance. Insurance that's slowly fading away; simply because it has become more accessible. 
Flying was very special 70 years ago. Only the very rich could afford a flight. It was an ''adventure'', you prepared for it days in advance. You dressed nicely, took a picture in front of the airplane, etc.
Today, flying is ''meh''. People get on and off planes without even realizing what they just did. It's become as common as riding a bicycle. You can literally book a flight a few hours in advance (of departure) and travel across several countries within a few hours, for only $50 (cheap European airlines).
Comparing it to a college degree would be too extreme, but that's, approximately, the way we are heading. Hell, civilians can take flight courses and become pilots these days. 
Nothing wrong with investing a couple of $k in a promising technology. Those few $k won't make you rich. What is a few $k these days? You can't even survive a month on a few $k in almost all Western countries. Going to college costs, what, $50k to $200k in the US on average? It's a small gamble. 
You're free to ignore it. But don't commit suicide when it reaches an amount of money previously thought to be impossible. Nobody will feel sorry for you &amp; you'll have to get back to your boring 9-to-5 job until you're 70 years old (you'll, hopefully, have paid off your mortgage &amp; loans by that time. Your company went bankrupt? Poor you, a 70 year old grandpa with no roof above his head. Extreme situation? Yes. Uncommon? Definitely not. Even people with decades of experiences &amp; master's degree(s) have had this happen to them).

A college degree was still worth something in the 80's. Nobody can deny that it's losing its value quickly. And you can't compare it to those ads since those were simply about trading methods, etc. This is about a new technology, a revolutionary one. The world is globalizing very fast, cryptocurrencies will only encourage the process. 
You should compare it to other technologies; internet, computers, etc. The early adopters (who really got into the business/technology) got rich.

If litecoin is useless, than bitcoin is useless. They serve the same purpose &amp; are based on the same technology. Do you even realize how stupid you sound? That's like a banker saying *''Don't use Euros. Euros are useless. Use dollars instead.''* I don't know what bitcoiners get out of demonizing other cryptocurrencies / communities?

No, I won't. And I haven't. I just read your history and I saw a lot of heavily downvoted comments. I also noticed that you commented on a few Redditor's comments history to prove your point(s).
Why can you comment on someone's post-history without having your ''nerves touched'', but I can't? It seems I touched a nerve of yours since you're acting frustrated/annoyed because I found something to use against you.

Are there female bitcoiners? :P
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:51:21
Your dozens of heavily downvoted comments in have definitely contributed to that.
