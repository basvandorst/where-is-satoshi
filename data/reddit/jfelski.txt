On path for ATH?

Well you need an ID to actually take the flight so it's not that anonymous. And why deposit money in a bank account to transfer it and pay a fee to buy crypto, that will likely change in value to buy a product with a currency that most vendors don't accept? And if you don't spend it pay another fee to withdraw it. And that's if it doesn't crash and they freeze transactions or you don't get hacked or the company goes out of business. Or hell, you just lose the drive, so many ways it can and does go to shit. I pay zero fees on my cards, I actually get 2% cash back, I don't carry a balance. If I lose it they replace it for free and there are zero fees. It's stable and reliable and accepted everywhere worldwide. But enjoy your Amazon gift cards.

What anonymity? You will have to use ID at some point to cash them in? And most people say they want crypto to eliminate credit cards fees and become anonymous but you are willing to pay 25% fees for an unstable currency that will require ID to cash in, you will pay taxes on profits and has been deciding in value for six months? Oh, and few places accept it and it can take time to validate.....seems logical.

So if I am right I collect a $600, if you are correct you could win upwards of $20000? That sounds legit. And regardless how would either of us even collect? I'm very confident but wagering 20000 again 600 is a stupid bet. The market can go either way no one knows for sure but it is more likely to go my direction than yours. But feel free to bookmark this and check back after 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, at a minimum you get shit talking rights.

Not sure charging beginners 15% fees to buy a slip of paper with a code on it that lost 70% value in the last six months and will cost more money to be cashed in is a big selling tool. Maybe without crazy fees people would be more inclined to drop $20 to understand the hype.

Where is the list of failed crypto?

And it could hit zero one day.....
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:44:44
People still hold AOL stock. People still hold Boston Store stock. Not sure I I would count 0.005 anything much better than zero. Value is based on what someone will pay, not if people hold it. If no one is willing to buy it the value is zero.
@_date: 2018-08-07 05:15:37
Yes to pay a 25% premium on a version of money that will likely lose value and can only be used in a handful of places, I guess cashing in would be the dumb option....

After he dumped all his coins at the top of the market and sits on a pile of cash. If he had any true faith he would have liquidated enough for a good life and left the remaining coins alone for the long tern.

Instantaneous 5% jump for Bitcoin and Litecoin on no news, I don't see any market manipulation at play here........

Well shit, my bad. Reading everything half ass as I speed read while working.

In a couple years you will have that chance. Then you can own lots that hold no weight or value. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:29:25
Because most people were only in it to make money. The risk outweighs the potential. Even for people that love the concept, losing so much money is hard to deal with. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 20:35:05
But the crash will continue.
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:59:51
Was almost 700 billion lost? There is a huge value and volume difference this time. The change in value was mostly free money at that point. Now we are dealing with the masses putting crypto on a credit card daydreaming about lambos, that won't happen twice. And with new legislation, credit cards refusing service and whales influence on the market most people will stay clear. Just because it recovered before, who cares? So did Enron, BOA, JC Penny, Sears, AOL and so on....
@_date: 2018-08-09 15:38:32
Yes and as I stated if you are correct I would be paying one Bitcoin worth 20K Plus if you are correct you would be paying one Bitcoin worth much less. That's not an equal wager. Regardless I have sold all my Bitcoin as it is a sinking ship. Enjoy your Lambo.....
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:10:33
@_date: 2018-08-09 18:38:06
And either way, as I cashed out I would have to buy a bitcoin to wager. So I put up let's say $6,500 today for a butcoin. Next year I win a bitcoin from you and get my original back, so I have two bitcoin at $1,000 each, not logical yo!
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:51:11
Gotta play the gamble, six months from now it will be back to 37k or down to 5k, what's your confidence level? If it's free money I would play it safe, if you can risk the loss let it ride. If it were at lower levels like in the past increasing by 500% would be a potential. At current levels with so many people that got burnt I don't see billions of new money being invested. But if I knew everything I would be retired....

Love how basic info gets so confused and twisted.  It's no wonder few have faith in crypto and it's followers.
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:34:12
Not at all. I'm saying the market and free industry created this drop. There is strength in the technology but the value is unsupported. Many big investors &amp; holders start buying up small bits of coin at increased values to raise the price. This morning the price increased by over 10% in less than 15 minutes, does that seem natural? Now all the small investors will start buying it again thinking it's going up, and that will start it going up. But when it doesn't move with speed, people will start selling again and cause it to drop even further. I have watched this happen a dozen-plus times in the last 12 months. I don't see it going over $4,200 then down to $3,100 this week. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:56:46
Don't worry, the fake buys and market manipulation kicked in and the price jumped $400 in 15 minutes, same as during every other drop in the past year. Now the lemmings will jump back in and buy more. The price will slowly rise for a few days before the next big drop. And before people bitch, I believe in the technology, but the price is not about the tech, it was people pushing it up to get rich. There is no difference here than the stock market. You have the rich and the businesses getting richer and richer, all funded by the masses. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:33:56
Scrolling through old posts it's amazing that everyone who said the price was going up has deleted their account and everyone who said it's going down is still here. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:32:14
Not at all, the rules are in play for the rich and the stupid poor invest their pennies with high hopes but lose 99% of the time. I'm not anti rich, I'm anti stupid and anti game. If people woke up and stopped giving their money away crap like markets, crypto and lottery would not exist. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:48:43
And I love how my post gets down voted for pointing out that the article is wrong and misleading. That's why adults and most real investors don't take crypto investments seriously. The foundation will move forward and change the world, but the daily investors that buy 0.01 litecoin at a time from coinbase are a joke. Dream of lambos and bitch about institutions.... 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:42:46
When it fell in the past money was switched to different coins. This time they are all down, they are being cashed out. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 15:43:50
Bitcoin was created by people, could be the government for all you know. It is not limited, a new split or coin could happen at any time. If there was only one it would be different, but 1,500+ coins? The government will control it. Do you assume they will stand by and no longer collect taxes? Super powers like China are shutting it down, the claim to fame is countries like Zimbabwe adapting? And I prefer cash in hand. Cash vs a code, let's see who wins during a power outage or natural disaster. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:06:05
I'm curious why it could never go to zero? Governments, economies, banks and corporations can fail and go to zero but a currency that you pay fees to buy, has minimal actual use, is not regulated or insured and has no governing body can't fail?
@_date: 2018-04-03 03:58:02
It's the "get rich" people that pumped 90% of the money into it over the last six months. They are the ones that cause the increase that got bitcoin into the news. Everyone on here cares about the money, I'm lost why it's so insulting to prefer to have a financial gain. I guess it's better to have a pointless digital coin that is not accepted or even taken seriously by 90% of the world and holds its value. Maybe keep the next one secret? 
@_date: 2018-07-10 18:32:17
I can see you worked really hard on that reply, so I won't be rude. Yes I do keep cash in hand, as well as emergency rations, medicine and so on. Has my cash lost value? Absolutely. My buying power has been cut in half in the last ten years alone. But bitcoin has been cut 70% in six months. In a state of emergency my cash will have limited buying power, my bitcoin will be worthless. I do feel the technology will be there. But for the opposite reasons you do. The government's want more control, more ability to tax and watch money move. They will not just allow money (bitcoin) to move freely for goods and services without them taking a portion. Many say what can they do? Well they can seize it. Just like they did silk road and even backpage. If I am at risk of breaking the law and losing all of my investment, would I? No. I have no need to hide my money and risk everything. And regardless, the fees to buy and sell bitcoin as well as the swings make it pointless to me. And when I did buy it was simply for profit, not for some greater meaning. But what I gained, someone lost. There will always be losers. The billions the twins and other whales have made was $100 at a time from many people that could not afford it. 90% of the ads and experts on how high this will go are paid ads or people with an interest. No true experts or scholars have any faith. As far as it having value because it's limited, so are my pubes. Do they hold value? No, because just like coins there are lots of others out there. It's great that you have a passion in this. But most people are in it for the cash. When the cash flow slows down so does the interest. I bought in at 4.5k and sold around 15k. I took that money and purchased money in visa and mastercard. My original 15k would be worth 19k if I held out, instead I sold for 45k and invested in Financials and now have 56k. You have great passion but my extra 36k for not having faith in Bitcoin future feels good. And as I watch it slip further I wonder how many will hold waiting for it to go back, but it likely never will. You listen to the few that say millions per coin, but most as hundreds.

Weird, the price went down down down then all of a sudden another 10% jump up for no reason. It's almost like there's a steady and consistent pattern that can be predicted of market manipulation.
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:08:00
Went up to $4,200 and then back down as planned. At $3,300 right now, give it until morning. Probably gonna stall around 3,000 for a few days, have a 10%-15% instant jump then go back to $3,700 for a few days. I see sub $2,400 yet this month. I will get down voted because people hate what I say, but it's correct. It's a shitty pattern. It's not the pre 2017 market, run by those that care about a concept. This is 99% about profit and retail investors keep losing.
