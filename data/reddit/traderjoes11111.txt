I'd have to have at least 5mil in cash to consider retiring, the rest could stay in crypto.

How can you say it's a myth and say it almost never does at the Same time?
It definitely happens

It isn't a bubble until it pops, maybe it already did... maybe going to 19 and dropping back to 16 was the correction... what has been proven though is it always comes back better

This is nothing like that...god people are so idiotic.

If the 1 Satoshi isn't created there wouldn't it be created later from a different block?

If they found private buyers it wouldn't hurt the price because they would be buying them....

How much exactly did you come to the conclusion it would cost for one child?
I'm thinking about the same thing except I have a few more kids haha.
My home and everything is already paid for them and I have a nice business so everything else is basically just to take care of my children.
Plus I got in under a thousand bucks.

How would this make them money? People are so misinformed....

So don't you think these companies have thought about everything you're saying I mean these are multi-billion-dollar companies not one person sitting at the house coming up with theories.
They know what they're doing, however I still don't think it's going to crash the price I still think it's going to rise.

I don't think it'd get that low before buyers jump in, there are tons of people waiting with buy orders at certain amounts I don't think it would get below 10K.
But you never know the futures could cause panic sells if they prepared well enough.
Other than that I don't see how they're going to make anything, bitcoin has to drop for them to make anything.
I just don't see why you would bet against bitcoin with the rise it's had unless you thought for a sure thing it was gonna drop or had an ace in the hole so to speak.
