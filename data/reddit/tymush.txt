Ok so now I tried all the words but dropped an S from the end of one of the words and the continue link lights up..
 Holy shit I got access to it! I just kept trying the word list with very slight tweaks hoping to find an error in copying and all it took was dropping an S from one of the words! Thank you thank you thank you! got a wallet for me to send a tip to? :)  So do you recommend I transfer to my new electrum wallet or would the blockchain phone app be sufficient ?

I even tried that option and entered my 12 word pass phrase but the button to continue would not light up to become clickable..

I very much appreciate your help! I've followed the steps again and end up with the same thing. A blank new wallet, with no history or balance and where none of the listed addresses match any of the old wallet addresses that I found in weeks old emails. At this point should I simply wait out the email change authentication (1-4 weeks) and see what happens? gah this is annoying. *edit*  and the wallet is quite recent so I doubt it's the too old issue.

I am having a similar issue, I just made a post to This was my post: 
 I am trying to login to my blockchain wallet to make a payment to an online vendor. I did not receive the login email verification after a few tries so I clicked the option "Reset two step verification to regain access to your wallet", it asked for another email address so I typed it in and clicked the confirmation link that I received in that other email address, but I am still not receiving a login verification email after a few more tries and lots of waiting. Anybody else have this issue? Any suggestions? Thanks guys

that is the propper link right? It's where I get directed to when I click more options and then recover funds thru the official login page. It even says Blockchain Lexembourg S.A.R.L. [LU] in front of the URL. When I enter the 12 word phrase there the "continue" button remains un-clickable.

hey man it's still not working for me even tho their twitter says it's fixed. May I ask how you did that? thank you

Well this all must be hung up on the fact that I am pending email change authorization ? I can't see what else is different

Hi any help would be great. I followed your steps and now have an electrum wallet which shows a balance of 0..  Can you clarify that last xpub step a bit? I am lost and I feel like I just lost over a grand.

I ended up getting it working by dropping an S from the end of one of the words, thanks so much for you patience and advice! Do you have a wallet link I could drop a tip in for your help?

Alright clearly you know what you are talking about and I am so thankful you are helping me with all this!:D but I am entering the 12 words as written in my notepad the day I set up that wallet, maybe 2 months ago tops. Case sensitivity wouldn't be a factor would it? Just the 12 words spelled correctly in american English and in correct order.

My thought exactly, glad the problem doesn't seem to be on our ends. When you search for the issue it seems like it's been an intermittent problem for years now. I'm sure it will just start working randomly in the next 24 hours or so.

So I made the electrum wallet using my 12 word phrase and I ended up on a wallet screen with a balance of 0 but no history. I have not entered the phrase into any link that I was sent via email. If I understand you correctly, if I had connected to my wallet and funds were stolen, I would see a history showing that to be the case? *edit*  My blockchain is currently pending an email change and customer service told me it will be 1-4 weeks before they authorize it even tho I clicked an official confirmation link that they sent me right away. Could this effect me opening it with electrum ?
