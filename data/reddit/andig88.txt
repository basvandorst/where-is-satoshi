There isn't. It does not get much simpler than that unless someone actually makes an app focused on coinmap. Also you can always just ask in the OSM forum or on  and someone can check if you made a mistake.

Except they don't accept it at the store which makes it really awkward when people go there.

Or keep your money and contribute to OpenStreetMap =&gt; Coinmap
I honestly don't understand how cares so much about *open*, but is not able to fix all those Menufy entries  and  possible other 3rd party payment options.

If you like a open map and services like coinmap that use them 
Also:

But then you are not fixing the issue, but only creating a closed 3rd party system.
@_date: 2014-07-28 02:55:58
Nobody prevents someone else from using the OSM data.
@_date: 2014-07-17 20:17:47
I wish more people would understand that. OpenStreetMap is a community project and unless someone here sits down and find a way to tag stores that only accept it online nothing will change. The OSM community does not have this on their prioirity list.
@_date: 2014-07-10 19:16:56
The problem is that nobody want to invest some time to figure out how to tagg 3rd party bitcoin services. OSM could easily remove all Menufy entries, but we don't want to destroy all that work.
@_date: 2014-07-10 19:12:10
Coinmap is based on OpenStreetMap. If you want coinmap to show something different you have to work with OSM.
So it is pretty much the Bitcoin cummunities fault for not willing to spend any time on this issue. The OpenStreetMap community simply does not have this very high on their list. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 02:56:20
You mean like Bitcoin?
Also 50% are bascially just sign up and hit edit.
@_date: 2014-06-12 00:54:22
Well, that's all great, but for me the main thing at stake here is the OpenStreetMap database. So for me fixing would mean introducing new tags, as well as services/apps that are greared towards adding Bitcoin data (similar to [Wheelmap]( so people can do with without getting into OSM.
I'm not trying to criticize your project, I'm just saying it has very little to do with the problem at hand here.
Although I honestly don't understand why if you use OSM data and make your data free to access you just don't put it into the database in the first place.
@_date: 2014-07-17 20:23:28
Did you remove the fake ones?
@_date: 2014-07-17 20:43:21
Get an account on 
Zoom in on the store
Klick edit at the top
If the store does not exist at all, remove the node. If it is a building then remove everything apart from building and addr: tags. 
If it just does not take Butcoin remove payment:bitcoin=yes (just click the bin symbol at the end of the line)
Btw. you might have to click on *all tags* on the left when you selected something to see the tags.
Save changes.
@_date: 2014-07-17 20:20:55
Could you elaborate that I really don't see what is complicated about the ID editor.
You can also try  but I don't feel like it is that much easier.
@_date: 2014-06-11 22:25:42
Have you actually been in contact with the OpenStreetMap community? Because the only way this can be solved is by introducing new tags and those should be discussed.
@_date: 2014-04-29 20:59:31


Not they should not, especially if isn't just about online vs. in the store, but about a 3rd party service.
Could you maybe link on of those locations on OSM? Because if those are actually mass imports by an menufy.com account could be against the OSM rules, especially if it is wrong data.
If it was only about in store vs. online then a opesntreetmap tag could be created that deals with that.
@_date: 2014-04-29 21:32:54
Yeah pretty obvious. Which means there are probably more than 700 restaurants listed by them, which don't actually accept Bitcoin... great...
@_date: 2014-05-02 23:23:11
Wait does that data come from menufy or from OpenStreetMap? Did someone fix that? Because right now that's a pretty big clusterfuck.
Edit: 
Yeah that's bad... that's really bad... Not at all how OpenStreetMap works...
@_date: 2014-05-03 15:29:20
Which most of them don't do. So this needs a different tag.
@_date: 2014-06-19 11:47:54
The problem is that some people kept adding shops that were listed on menufy for example. (Which could actually be done, but with a different tag, so the Bitcoin community would have to come up with something)
Also coinmap is based on OpenStreetMap which is a community project. So for it to be successful and accurate people need to take part and at least report mistakes (note on map) or just get and account and fix the error. Removing the Bitcoin tag on  does not even take a minute.
