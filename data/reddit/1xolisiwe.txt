No. The fact is some people in life are just miserable so even if they become rich, money just becomes an additional stressor. 
I’m not saying one doesn’t need money to get by in life. Just that money is not everything.

Of course they would get more miserable, but the fact remains that money didn’t bring them happiness.

There’s a big difference between being rich and being comfortable. 
I didn’t say one needed to be poor to enjoy life, just pointing out that money doesn’t necessarily equate happiness. There are other options between being filthy rich and being dead broke...

As someone who worked in a private hospital where a lot of very wealthy people were admitted for various issues, I can assure you that money really doesn’t buy happiness. 
If you’re a miserable person, you just become a miserable person with money. 
Also look at the fact that the depression and suicide rate in 3rd world countries is way lower than in 1st world countries, yet people are wealthier in the latter.

The last research I heard stated that after 75k per annum (I think it was in usd), money didn’t actually make people any happier. 
The reason for less depression in 3rd world countries is having support from extended family and friends, whereas in 1st world countries people tend to become isolated once they lose close family members. 
As a person from a 3rd world country, I can assure you that people are not dying all over the place. That’s just what they show on tv. I would also get the impression that things were really dire in America if all they ever showed on tv was the poorest slums where people are really desperate.

You don’t always need to spend money to enjoy time with your family and friends, nor does exploring the world have to be taken in it’s literal sense. You could explore your local park with your loved ones, without having to spend anything. 
The point is money is not the be all and end all of life. Sometimes having money can actually add to someone’s stress, just like not having it can also be stressful.

Agreed. There’s so much more to life than just money. I really hope services for mental health treatment get improved. 
Some really wealthy and famous people have still committed suicide despite their apparent success, so money and fame is not the answer.

People in 3rd world countries do have Internet, and I can assure you that Facebook has done a fair bit of damage. They also have their own reality shows and some have even released sex tapes to achieve the kardashian fame. �� I certainly felt happier when I got rid of fb and I’ve come to accept that anyone can claim to be anything on reddit whilst sitting in their mum’s basement.

You haven’t conducted a study either. I just used the research that actually is available. We are basically saying the same thing anyway so am not sure why you are arguing? I never said that poverty brings happiness. There’s a lot of middle ground in-between. I’m just pointing out to those people who may not be aware that money isn’t always the answer.

The research actually says the more people earn after 75k, the more they feel like their life is working out as a whole, but it doesn’t make them any happier. I don’t know how to add a link to the research but you can certainly google it.
