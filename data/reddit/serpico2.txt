I can hear this coming out of the 20 year old intern’s mouth first. 
Congressperson: “So, explain crypto to me in a sound bite.”
Intern: “There is Bitcoin, and there is shit coin.”

My $2500 at ATH (sucker here!) has turned into $500 but it’s better than the $300 of two months ago lol

I appreciate your enthusiasm but understand basic macroeconomics.

I didn’t know about BTC until 2017; decided at that point (ATH) that it was smarter to buy Alts which had better chances at parabolic growth. Invested $2500 which went to $300 (at its worst). Consolidated into BTC and am now at $650 after 1 week and am strapped in for the long haul.
That said, imagine being one of these people who threw $100 at BTC in 2010 or 2011. Insane to think about (assuming you didn’t lose your keys lol, I bet that happened to a few people).

I held Alts until recently; just consolidated into BTC because of Binance’s US decision.

Japan’s national debt is more than twice the size as the US’ debt as it relates to GDP and they don’t have the global reserve currency. I’m a crypto bull long term but this anarcho-libertarian argument that’s so popular on this sub about global debt collapse is a pipe dream. Adoption will come gradually as blockchain begins to pervade the economy as a whole; and it will be symbiotic with fiat in the near term a la Libra or some other stable coin before it’s destructive towards fiat in any way.
