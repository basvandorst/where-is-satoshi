I'm not an expert, but the part where you lock your bitcoins to move them to the LN, that part can only be public. But from there on, it can be as private as you make it.
I don't know if it has to be visible who you opened the initial channel with. But that probably also needs to be visible.

Hashrate doesn't fall with price falling because a lot of the price of mining is the initial cost of miners. So if the price falls, you still want to use up those miners before they are too old to be useful as new miners enter the market.
But if the price was down for a while, then people wouldn't buy new miners when the old ones got broken or got obsolete.

Ok, you added fungibility to your comment. I'm not sure how my solution cripples fungibility, but I wouldn't be suprised if it did in a way I'm not aware of. If sending taxes was anonymous, fungibility would be solved in my opinion. The IRS doesn't know who gave it money, they just know how much, and they know that you can't not give money if you have a colored wallet.
If all transactions are anonymous, you can't "mark" certain bitcoins.
Anyway, you are against taxes altogether, so there's no point in going any further in this conversation.
@_date: 2014-12-01 10:44:28

Nope, Bitcoin miners do not make the Rootstock smart contracts any more secure. It's not Bitcoin miners that are going to compute smart contracts. All Bitcoin is going to do is ensure that the sum of Bitcoins going in and the Bitcoins going out is zero. What happens in the meantime, and who stole Rootstock coin from whom, that doesn't interest the Bitcoin miner. So all you have is a small network of smart contract miners, while all the smart contract crowd is already in Ethereum, solving bugs and getting stronger. Sometimes it's all about who's first.

If the escrow company is a well known one, than there shouldn't be much risk. The same as banks. But of course there is risk.
At least if you keep your bitcoin address well hidden, secret and safe, there is no chance of anyone taking it. If you hold your money in a bank, there is definitely a chance it will disappear, no matter how diligent you are.
But for an average user, banks are probably safer. Much more bitcoins were lost due to lost wallets than anything else.

What if you opened a bitcoin account for every NPC in the game? And if your player was actually a bitcoin account? When you register, your bitcoin account is created, with 0 bitcoins (and you don't get the password). When you transfer bitcoins from your bitcoin account to your characters bitcoin account, game server takes 75%, and leaves your 25%.

Is that too much unnecessary load for the bitcoin network? Because if not, the accounting part of the game infrastructure is practically unnecessary.

Nobody wants your pictures, tax returns, social networks and so on. Everybody wants your bitcoins. It's not comparable by any stretch of imagination.

This could work for legitimate artists who don't want the hassle of having or renting download servers. Just make a mechanism for sending a percentage to the originator.

Well, PoS is one way and there are possibly other ways.

I agree. If Bitcoin succeeds, banks either slowly die, or drastically change their business model. Why do banks have all this wealth? Because people don't know how else to store their money. It's funny. Our whole economies are run on the premise people don't know where to put their paper bills.
This will change, and you will need companies that can help you hold the password to your own money which only you will be able to spend. And like that, Banks lose money.

Comments on Market say Bitcoin Wallet drains the battery. I really wouldn't like that.

Bitcointalk post about the transaction.
 It would be nice to find the exact transaction.

If it's totally open, then no one says who can sell what. That was the idea.

You would need a strong escrow or a reputation system. But it's definitely coming :)

I read this being discussed, I think it's coming.

I'm guessing PoS can have mining pools too, so I think that's not a problem.

At the rate of inovation that is happening in cryptocurrency space, I think these questions will be obsolete by then.

But the transaction price is the same, which means it's more expensive to make small transactions. No?

I never read the federated chain was an intermediate solution. I think this is the end solution which solves the fast block times. So there will always be a certain number of big players which users of the Rootstock will have to trust.

What if Satoshi lost the Genesis block private key?

Well, [this should be the right answer]( But I'm guessing some other crypto will take over in the future, so watch out for that.

If bitcoin becomes a standard, Paypal suddenly gets a ton of competition. Right now it doesn't have as many competition because it's not easy to make a fiat money payment business. You need a ton of infrastructure.
With bitcoin, any company with a few good developers can make a global business that runs as good as Paypal, but a lot cheaper.
So yeah, I think Paypal is scared of Bitcoin.

Their fees are huge compared to simply sending Bitcoins. So they will have to reduce those. How do they pay their employees and rent?
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:31:32
What costs? Bitcoin can only save the cost of sending the information of a money transfer. I don't know how they send the information now, but it's probably some type of a secure VPN connection.

They are too big to take such a leap. They will fight this until their bitter end.

It might be because I was big on decentralized *everything* before Bitcoin, but as soon as I read the words "decentralized currency" I went into berserk mode and read as much as I could about it. There was never a pessimistic phase with me. Bitcoin evangelist all the way.

But the joke is not that they quickly settle their problems face to face, it's that they realize they are talking to another human being just like them.

It doesn't accept Bitcoins yet.

If you are a mere road user, then probably no. Not yet. If you are a hiker/skier/cycler then yes, it's probably much better where you live.

I'm not running it. Coinmap takes its data from [Openstreetmap]( a colaborative map that is editable by everyone, and anyone can use its data. Coinmap is just an interface.

Could you point exactly where it is on this map:
Just put a note on it. There is a note icon on the right, just move it where your bar is, and I'll put it in so it shows up on [Coinmap.org](

I like the Sudoku parallel to the proof of work concept. I'm going to use that to explain Bitcoin to people.

Bitcoin is the inevitable destruction of Western Union's transfer of money business. I don't see how they can compete with a virtually free substitute of their business model.
The only way they can survive is if they change their core model from the ground up, just like they did when they shifted from delivering telegrams to delivering money. Maybe start putting Bitcoin ATMs around?
@_date: 2013-08-07 09:32:13
Is this the right position of the bar?
@_date: 2013-09-05 12:30:39
I don't see how those hostilities could end. If Bitcoin gets widely accepted, Paypal is gone. It is completely redundant. Except if they accept Bitcoin, but then they are just one more online wallet.
