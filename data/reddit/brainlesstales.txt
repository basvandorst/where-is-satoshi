I was excited to get my moon mug in the mail today. Even though I drew the original, I still had to order my own mug. :)

I originally made the Y2K as my 2,000^th comic. :) It's fun to see one other than the roller coaster in here.

I like you, WetBooger! :) I made that *classic gif*.
@_date: 2018-05-17 01:56:15
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2014-05-18 23:55:44
I think it's a great version! I laughed. :)
@_date: 2014-05-18 23:39:21
Haha, I made the original! :)
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:28:14
Thank you! :D I got bits!
@_date: 2015-01-04 15:52:02
Thanks! It's raining bits!
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:53:29
I love to see new versions. I made the original. :)
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:14:42
Wow, thank you so much! You are too kind. :)
@_date: 2017-01-17 22:16:25
This is great. Good job! :)
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:42:35
I like the way you think. I'm laughing so much from this. :)
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:09:06
Hahaha, that is awesome! I love it! :D

I love seeing my Bitcoin roller coaster reappearing in it's many forms. The most reddit thing about it is when I first created the original and posted it to this sub 3 years ago it got a big fat zero in upvotes. :)

I don't blame anyone for buying those, but that is my art and whoever is making those shirts does not have permission from me, nor have they contacted me in any way. I've been working on releasing shirts, but haven't yet so I better get on it.

Hey, glad he's your favorite! I'm selling [official Bitcoin Roller Coaster]( stuff now. I also added a bit of the roller coaster history on my website.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:27:19
I don't own a single one. If there was enough demand I would sell some things for Bitcoin, but right now it's all print on demand.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:08:16
Hi, I sell [official Bitcoin Roller Coaster shirts on my site]( I created the original one. :)
@_date: 2015-08-25 02:11:10
I love this version with the Benny Hill song! I made the original gif. Edit: thanksforgold.gif

Yes, Bitcoin is divisible by 100 million. Similar to how a dollar is divisible by 100.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:16:55
Unfortunately no because I use Zazzle to fulfill orders and they don't accept it. :(
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:41:04
I created the original Bitcoin Roller Coaster gif. Go get a [moon mug]( to celebrate! :D
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:19:02
Thanks, I wish I could accept Bitcoin, but I'm using Zazzle to fulfill the orders and they don't accept it.
@_date: 2017-09-10 21:26:12
I'm happy to contribute art and fun. We should always try to have a good time doing what we are doing.
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:14:25
As the creator of the original drawing and gif I say this is awesome! Great job. :)
@_date: 2017-09-09 00:13:21
Well I also posted it on bitcointalk.org and shared with friends in the Bitcoin community at the time. I also was drawing a daily web comic and I shared it with that audience as well. After not long it showed up on one of the price watching sites for a moment when the price was going wild. Then it started popping up when people started updating it to reflect the market. I have 7 different fan versions saved. It continues to be a fun roller coaster ride. :)
@_date: 2017-09-08 23:15:59
It is fun! I originally drew it in April 2013. When I first posted it to this subreddit no one cared! I guess I needed a better title.

Edit: Thank you for the gold! :D

ATH stands for All Time High. The ATH on GDAX is $19,892. We are currently not seeing an All Time High. We are seeing a spike today. :)

It is usually Sunday 6pm at Strange Brew in Manchester, NH in the backroom. This past one was at Murphy's because it was expected to be larger. Just ask the hostess where the Bitcoin people are, and then introduce yourself.

The meet up was in Manchester. I just got the stickers this week so they aren't in any stores yet.
@_date: 2018-04-10 21:28:28
Ok, thank you! I think the distinction is the longest running consecutive weekly meetup. Congrats to you and your group! Great to hear about. :)
@_date: 2018-04-10 03:16:09
Thanks. I think they are really fun!
@_date: 2018-04-10 04:16:27
This is true. I took the photo prior to the meet up. But I still have more and they look just like these. :)
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:20:51
Haha, thanks. I am the original artist and creator. You can see my name matches [my website name]( where I host a history and sell some other items. :)
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:28:46
I didn't start it, but some of my friends did. Looks like the person who created the Facebook event was Josh from [Lamassu BTC ATM]( This event was from before they were even building those. The first weekly meetup was on June 30, 2012. It has been happening ever since. [The Facebook Event from the first one.](
@_date: 2018-04-10 03:17:02
Oops. Soon enough! Going down is half the fun because we'll be going up after that.
@_date: 2018-04-10 21:26:48
Yes, all of the stickers I sold at the meetup were paid for with Bitcoin.
