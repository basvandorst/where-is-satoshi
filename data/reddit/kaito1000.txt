It is safe yes
It is also know as botance due to the trading bots which will make like difficult if ‘real’ vol is low.

Omg people wake up.  Highly likely it won't but no one can say it's impossible. If people stop using it - it disappears. Saying 'never' about anything is daft.

Maybe not trezor

Never say never. Investors in many companies have said the same and they folded. (Look what happened the Dukes!)

It's like talking to a brick wall

No one said it was fait or was a bank....  
all it would take would be for the big hitters to dump their coins all at once - just like fait, just like shares.

No shit sherlock. 
Google any number of fiat in the world that's essentially become zero if that example suits you better.  Do I think it will? Odds are low Do I think it can't - no.

Will you have any btc by the end of it considering the fees on a $10 transaction?
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:56:51
You're saying it's impossible for btc to fail. Nothing is impossible to fail. Your naivity to see that truth is simply ignorance of the world. I have given you two examples where people like you said the same and it happened.
