While I can't speak to using it for paper wallets specifically, I picked up this exact printer. It's fantastic for B/W printing. I wouldn't use ebay though, I picked mine up at Office Max for &lt; $100.

I can see keeping 2,000 BTC there if you had a total of like 50,000 BTC and the 2k was your fluid trading funds. What I can't see was not slowly pulling out of Gox months ago in small BTC chunks.

I can't say he wouldn't deserve it. This new pope is pulling an Edward Snowden on the church, afterall.

Snowden didn't reveal secrets because he likes to gossip. He revealed them to try and clean out corruption. The pope is also trying to clear out corruption.
