One of the reasons they've actually been able to continue to print money like this is actually because of drug trade. And they don't want to admit it but billions of USD cash arre held in houses in Mexico and in Hong Kong and in Afghanistan. The War on Drugs is turning into a war on cash and that's why we need to prepare with a different type of currency.  the Fed has done a great job of not allowing inflation and I don't think it's going to happen in the short term but there is a long-term plan here and that's exactly what this is about
