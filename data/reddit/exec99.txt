This is a revolutionary idea. I hope whoever is behind it can do something to increase confidence in the site. It needs to be very transparent on where the money is going and being spent while somehow protecting the whistleblowers and the donors. It seems like a hard balance to keep but if it can be pulled off then it could be the biggest thing since Wikileaks.

Same thing has happened to me a lot. I've even had my votes change from up to down. I thought it was just while using the iPhone app. Are you using the app by any chance?

Ok that's good to know. I hope it's just a mobile thing.

Yeah I should have been more clear. I think the British monarchy has lots of power behind the scenes.

I've been using them for awhile now, no complaints. I used circle, coinbase, a few others that I don't remember now, Uphold has easily been my favorite.

I agree they have nothing to gain, which is why it confuses so much. But do you think that they count on most users not to try to make a profit off them, as in buying low then selling high like I did? They have no rules against it but you can see why they wouldn't want it if they thought someone was going to take advantage of it. See, they changed everyone's accounts a few months ago to store money in dollars instead of Bitcoin, saying it was to shield customers from price volatility of Bitcoin. But they still allowed you to change it back to store in Bitcoin if u wanted so I did. Then I bought up in the high $200 and sold at 400, doubling my money. I admit they had reason to not like that, but as I said it is perfectly within their rules and service they offer to do that. So if that wasn't why they closed my account, what other possibility do you suggest it may be?

Do you store your money on the Circle account in Bitcoin or dollars?
