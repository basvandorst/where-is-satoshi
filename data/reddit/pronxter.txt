Don't agree. Eleven currencies can be called "dollar" because LOCATION reduces ambiguity -- if I'm in Canada, I use Canadian dollars; if I'm in America, I use US dollars;  etc.
Cryptocurrencies have no geographical restrictions (except perhaps in NY State ha ha ha) so that context doesn't exist. 
The word "bit" also has multiple other meanings... perhaps less important (I've never used two bits to pay for a shave and a haircut), but it's still relevant. 
EDIT: grammar ;-)

How much time are you willing to invest? ROI on Nxt forging is about 0.1%.  Compounded at that rate, plan to wait approximately 30 centuries before your stake increases enough to make an attack worthwhile.
That's enough, right there, to discount your argument.  But let's continue.
Nxt only allows a chain re-org 720 blocks behind the current block height. This is a kind of rolling, decentralized checkpoint built in to the block validation algorithm. So any attack would have to create a chain of highest possible cumulative difficulty WITHIN 16 hours (at the current average block generation rate). This is not trivial, since cumulative difficulty in Nxt is a function of time between blocks, with longer blocks currying more favor with the network. Contrary to common perception, the "longest" chain does not win in Nxt. The most difficult one does, and (at present) the process for deciding who gets to generate a block is NOT deterministic.
One way to get around this MIGHT be to withhold blocks intentionally ... but the upcoming Economic Clustering feature will detect this and penalize you for trying by temporarily reducing your staking power to zero for 1440 blocks. It will also reinforce the "authentic" chain by forcing new transactions to "refer" to older transactions on the consensus chain. This is a variation on Vitalik Buterin's "Transactions as Proof of Stake" concept (even though Nxt devs thought of it first), which he believes to be the best possible POS implementation.

Yeah there is.  It's called "proof of stake".

If ONLY Nxt had a functioning, decentralized asset exchange that let you keep control of your own coins at all times, supported by a system that lets you securely transfer BTC and LTC in and out of the market!
Oh, wait.

25 Bitcoins are invented out of thin air every ten minutes, and are only handed to people who have invested substantial amounts of money into mining technology.  Is that unfair?
Kristoffer Koch bought 5000 bitcoins for $27USD in 2009 (source:  ), and sold them four years later for $886,000USD -- a return on investment of more than 33,000 times.  Is that unfair?  
By comparison, the oldest, largest stakeholders in Nxt (of which there are currently less than 5) have seen a 9,000-fold return on their investment.  So is Nxt a scam, or is Bitcoin?
Everyone who invests in any crypto *takes a risk*.  Some pay off massively, but most don't.  Looking back at only the success stories and using those to make a point is known as *survivor bias*.

Thanks, Vitalik, for showing the Nxt community that the Nxt community's assertion that "nothing-at-stake" attacks are NOT trivial is *correct*.
@_date: 2014-06-24 02:16:44
I hope they can sort things out and restart the service.  The community there is really cool.  Deb &amp; Doug's dedication to "provably fair" is admirable and should be a model that is celebrated... not regulated.

I'd love to see Peter Todd become a Nxt developer :)

The full supply was issued in the genesis block -- Nxt is 100% pure proof of stake and there was no POW distribution phase.
If you want to know more you might find the whitepaper of interest: 
@_date: 2014-08-16 15:44:42
Your response illustrates that I probably didn't argue my point well, since your rebuttal is completely backwards.

In this case, the devs released a "new" version of software that would invalidate transactions sent to the thief's account.
In order to force a fork, the majority of stakeholders would have to update to this new client, invalidating those transactions and forcing the blockchain to reorganize. Other transactions would have been reprocessed into new blocks.
Almost nobody willingly installed and used this "new" version, so the re-organization of the blockchain did not happen.
The devs participated by allowing Nxt stakeholders to each make their own choice; stakeholders voted overwhelmingly, with their stake, to leave the blockchain unchanged.
@_date: 2014-06-30 01:46:37
Because you have to win the right to forge a block, with a probability that is dependent on your stake, for EACH block in the chain.  To be valid, the signature of the first block has to be based on the signature and payload hash of the previous block.
If you build a chain all by yourself and try to feed it to the main chain, it will be rejected.  It's been tried.  It failed.
Go ahead and try.  Nxt is live and waiting!  I'll even give you some coin to start, if you send me your address!
Also: that paper is a POS of a different kind.
@_date: 2014-08-16 18:50:03
Won't work.  The "base target" value is affected by what percentage of the total coins are forging on your little network (the fully supply of Nxt is always known and never changes, unless tokens are burned by sending them to the genesis account.  You cannot "fake" stake).
Again, I eagerly await your attack.  
@_date: 2014-07-06 21:33:23
So how is an IPO a scam?
BCNext was also on equal footing when he released Nxt to the world.  Everyone had six weeks to contribute to getting stake.  You clearly didn't.  Neither did I.
I'm not disputing your assertion that Nxt's initial distribution was very IPO-like.  However, you finished your first comment with "it's a scam" after complaining about a big "BTC payday".  Defend that point.

Nxt is not closed source: 


I really think you should read more about Nxt before making pronouncements about how easily it can be gamed, my friend.  In the context of Nxt, your statement literally makes no sense: you cannot arbitrarily construct a chain and feed it to the network.


This paper is based on Bitcoin-related implementations of proof of stake.  Nxt does not work that way.
Please take some time to read and participate: 
@_date: 2014-07-22 16:56:34


You have not demonstrated that this is true.  I welcome your proof.


You've dangerously conflated ALL forms of PoS into a single one.  There are multiple approaches to PoS and Nxt's does not operate in the way you are suggesting.
All accounts forge using an "effective balance" parameter, which is determined based on stake that has been stationary for at least 1440 blocks (currently, about 40 hours).  It is not possible to "separate" this stake in any way, and forging account's stake is verified as part of the block verification process.  The most current stake you can use to forge is stake that is 1440 blocks old.  You cannot shuffle coins to game this system.  There is no "coin age" in Nxt that can be stored or gamed.
In addition, Nxt bases consensus on the concept of the chain with the highest *cumulative difficulty*, not length.  If you create a fork by generating a bunch of rapid-fire blocks (this is VERY hard to do, but let's honor the argument), the cumulative difficulty of that chain would be *low*, and other nodes would reject it UNLESS you also controlled at least 51% of Nxt's stake -- you can create that scenario for the low, low price of $24.5 million US dollars, assuming that you can get it all through a private sale that doesn't crash the price AND that most of the large stakeholders would willingly sell you their piece.  
The best way to "game" Nxt is to forge a chain with *high difficulty* (this is VERY hard to do, but let's honor the argument).  The catch-22 is that, unless you owned the majority of Nxt stake (for the low, low price of $22.5 million USD, at current rates, assuming that your buy order doesn't drive up the price exponentially!), this chain would then be accepted by other nodes, who would use it as the basis for their forging attempts. This would dilute your stake on that fork, and take away your ability to control it.
So... good luck with that.


This is not currently true; the feature is not implemented yet.  Assuming it were, though, the statement is *still* not true.  Cumulative difficulty is the key for consensus, and this will be *reinforced* by a clustering mechanism based on the notion that transactions contain hashes of earlier blocks.  This is close to Vitalik Buterin's approach of "transactions as proof of stake", and is *extra insurance* against attacks, *not* the primary defense.


What a bizarre statement.   I don't accept the premise of your "if", since we disagree that PoS requires trust.  Nonetheless:
In Bitcoin and other proof of work systems, you don't even have to own any tokens in order to take control of the network.  All you need (as if this is trivial) is a lot of hashing power.  In other words, the "wasteful" work can be used against a PoW currency by buying up (or creating) enough hashing power to take control of the blockchain.  You can buy hashing power without affecting the price of the coin.
In a PoS currency, the only means of taking control of the blockchain is by taking control of stake.  You have to own coins in order to use them against themselves.  Buying and selling stake affects the value of the coin and the network directly.
The distinction is subtle but important:  in PoS, stakeholders hold power and must hold stake.  In PoW, miners hold power and do not need stake at all.  The latter is more dangerous, IMHO.


After 2140, BTC will also be predistributed.  BTC is in distribution right now.  PoW is a distribution mechanism, and you know that the guy with the most hashes gets the most distribution.  The hashrate overlords control the currency.   
Yes, Nxt is "predistributed".   Distribution is a problem nobody has solved yet.  Hundreds of coins have tried (everything from pre-mine to distribution-by-forum-post to IPO to hybrid PoW/PoS), and nobody's solved it.  Ethereum is STILL trying to sort it out.  Here's the bottom line: if Nxt were distributed to 1,000,000 people, 6.9 billion people would complain that it was unfair.
After 8 months, the largest Nxt account (which is actually operated by an exchange that profits from every Nxt trade) holds 5% of coins.  After 5 years, the largest BTC account holds 1.6% of coins.  Nxt distribution is coming along quite well, by comparison.

This may be a good time to state that a Nxt Whitepaper is finally almost finished.  The caveat is that, due to Nxt's ongoing development, we've "capped" it based on the technologies and algorithms in the upcoming v1.2.2 release, and the TaPoS-like technology you've referred to is a little bit further down the road.
In fact -- aw heck, why not -- you can see the current draft here:   
I'd even welcome comment (you can comment right in the doc), but I'm sure you don't have tons of time. 
In addition... I know YOU know this, but in case anyone else is interested, the Nxt source code is VERY readable (if you're a programmer, anyway) and can be found here:

Perhaps you're thinking of Peercoin?  Peercoin "mints", and Nxt "forges".
The forging process for Nxt MAY change to a model that is more deterministic than stochastic ("transparent forging"); that math/model has been worked out and will likely invade the testnet soon...  but the current model is working brilliantly.  176,293 blocks, spaced an average of 80 seconds apart, prove it.  Many attacks have been tried, and none have succeeded.  In the words of douchebags everywhere, "come at me, bro" ;)
Considering the Nxt whitepaper hasn't been published, I find your claim to have read it a little suspect.  There is a DRAFT, but it's a work in progress:  
Nxt also has no centralized checkpoints to reinforce the chain.  There is one fixed checkpoint at block 130,000 due to a feature change. That's it.
@_date: 2014-08-16 05:24:39
No. It's a disaster for BTER.  
The Nxt community did precisely the correct thing, and the decision was made by the community - not the devs.

The Multigateway (which enables BTC&lt;-&gt;Nxt and LTC&lt;-&gt;) is "federated" -- each currency is supported by three *independently-operated*, secured servers that broker exchanges between blockchains using multisignature transactions.  Two of the three independent operators would have to collude to corrupt the system.  It is as close to trustless as can be achieved, until someone successfully implements atomic cross-chain transactions.
Once assets are issued on the Nxt Asset Exchange, they're fully decentralized on the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-07-10 23:24:39
The only correction I'd make to your post is that Nxt has already done it -- the asset exchange has been live since May.
One way you can reach it is by visiting

What you've got wrong is that my node won't accept your fork unless it's LESS than 720 blocks old AND is accepted by all other nodes AND contains a chain of another 719 blocks on top of that first one, all created at very nearly the same time, that ALSO get accepted by all of those nodes.  You can't just arbitrarily create a block at height X and toss it into the pool.  Each new block must be built based on unique, probabilistic information from the previous block, using a probabilistic algorithm seeded by your effective balance, and each and every block is validated by every other node on the network -- almost all of which you do not control.  If you were Nxt's biggest account holder right now (our hacker is, BTW), you'd only control 5%. 
So you're right -- you're not backwards; you just don't know how Nxt works.  You can always prove me wrong by trying it.  I can wait.

Nxt's decentralized asset exchange (which relies on coloured coins concepts) goes live at block 135000, which is about three hours from now.
It's also pure Proof of Stake, delightfully decentralized, and features 1-minute block generation times. 
You'd be wise to take a look!  Http://nxt.org/
