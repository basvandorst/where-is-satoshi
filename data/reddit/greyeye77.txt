AML just bites anyone offering service like that in USA.
Bitinstant CEO end up in jail for operating exchange, while he may have acted in shady business, it shows that the gov will and can just shoot you down.
Now, if you're a business of BTC to cash service, why would you want to run a risk like that by providing service to Residents of USA? 
There are bigger fish to fry else where?

500k by 2020 ! But I think he meant BCH not BTC

price drop of several hundred $. just as normal stock, many will cash out BTC and when large sums of $ leaves the BTC, that means they have to SELL BTC at lower and lower (as market depletes and only available sellers are at the lower price point)
also some BAD news like Bitcoin fork (July's big correction was mostly due to fear that BTC may result in two chain and will crash)
Fork did happen to BCH, but price did not drop as much as others expected and now it's even higher (possibly as results of BCH selling)

Gov can ban exchanges that deals with fiat. I doubt that will happen anytime soon but always a possibility.

I had doubt but I see why not, BTC is no longer a cash replacement, but a hold to the wealth. While there are inflation, but there is a limit to it. Of course by then the transaction feee would be sky high, but that's a topic of its own.

There are two sides, no more mine = no more miners.
No more mine = transaction fee would sky rocket you cannot sell without losing significant amount of coin.
If you are an investor, some may consider pulling their funding and move to altcoin.
I think there will be a time the balance will tip over. Its prob not 2-3 yrs but its speculation at the best.
HODL?

I doubt thats simple as so.  
exchange controls the wallet and therefore when you buy/sell, it can transfer the funds almost immediately between the two addresses.  
Would you use an exchange if you need to wait 60min for BTC pair trade?

What you’re asking is same as web wallet. It already exist. You control the key, and you can send to anywhere you like.
