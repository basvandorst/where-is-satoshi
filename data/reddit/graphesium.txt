This. It's oddly delusional how this subreddit keeps claiming BTC is a currency-competitor (which it's supposed to be in theory) when all they boast about is how much they *don't* use it as currency. At this point, BTC is just a stock. It may as well be compared to Beanie Babies.

If you could afford the loan... then why did you take out a loan (which entails interest payments)? But whatever, it's your money, I wish you good fortune.

You took out a *loan* to gamble with? That's not a wise decision man, even if BTC is rising atm. Investing money you can't afford to lose is a recipe for disaster.

I own btc and I always get a good laugh at the daily r/bitcoin delusions.
