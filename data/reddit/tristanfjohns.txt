I love my KeepKey. For an emerging market these are great little devices. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 19:58:17
What do you think about KeepKey? 
@_date: 2017-01-09 04:00:13
HODL. 
@_date: 2017-01-15 22:10:25
I currently use Coinbase (I know, I know). 
I don't own a legal residence therefore don't receive any utility bills or the like. It seems a lot of the exchanges require such things to prove current residence. 
I have definitely been looking into P2P exchanges.

Yes, it was a low-key jab at the failures of the US electoral college and the all reigning orange supreme.

Though I agree with your sentiment, a lot of adoption will come through bitcoin being a "coffee money". I don't see bitcoin as a coffee money - but that's because I have poured through the technical aspects of it. Not everyone wants or can do the same thing. Some just want a way to move value digitally, and some just want an asset that doesn't inflate. But overall I've found that if you see it as a digital gold* then you're in it more than as an appreciating asset, but as a protocol that can change how we as a species operate. 
*Off topic, but I should probably specify my opinion on calling bitcoin a digital gold. It's fine as an analogy but personally I see bitcoin as a completely different asset class that isn't perfectly summarized as a "digital gold". 
@_date: 2017-01-09 20:47:16
You've lost me, as I don't see how banks have nothing to do with capitalism. Capitalism functions on banks as of today. Banks are opinionated and often corrupt, as well as being regulated by the state. But we need the state, therefore replacing or subverting banks is the answer.
Edit: wordchoice 
@_date: 2017-01-14 19:48:51
Like mentioned, having a full node doesn't really help backup your specific bitcoin. It helps the network by having one more node validating blocks, thus increasing chain security, but having a full node doesn't really do anything for you. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 04:58:51
I think the idea of a distributed ledger is orgasmic. 
That may be the nerdiest thing you've read all day, but... It's true. To me it looks like the Internet and the distributed ledger are made for each other. 
We (humanity) have taken the distributed ledger and integrated value into it that can be recorded, manipulated, and viewed anywhere with access to the Internet. 
Not only that, but there are so many ways you can secure your private key/bitcoin, with stuff like stamping it on metal, memorizing it, and multisig wallets. As a security nerd that excites me like no other. 
It just /makes sense/. Like many things in my life, bitcoin is one of the things where you just look at it and go "why aren't more people amazed by this???"

It appears network congestion is a common theme on Reddit at this time.

Oh gosh, hand writing. Though I'm intrigued enough to put up with it. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 22:32:35

Don't worry about it, it's how we learn.

Probably my favorite scene.

Could you elaborate on where you're getting the number $7-8B? 
@_date: 2017-01-17 17:16:46
I'm confused on what you mean by real world transactions. Do you not use your bitcoin to buy things? 
@_date: 2017-01-16 02:36:00
Young folk here, and I just.. I can't even. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 21:00:39
Ah yes, I was more just saying fuck banks in general, not necessarily for this one scenario of the OP. 
Again I try to keep my word choice deliberate. As of today, we need the state, or government regulation. When it comes to banks we have a solid way to replace them, through bitcoin or even DLT if the need be - but I don't see any logical way we could retain the safety and functionality of a centralized government whilst also removing the opinionated and the corrupt. 
And trust me, I would love to remove the opinionated and corrupt likely as much as you do. I hold a very specific opinion that is not reflected in the government. As of today, there isn't a way to reflect that opinion without massive amounts of effort, circling back to "while also retaining safety and functionality". So as sad as it is, humanity as a whole still needs centralized government. 
Eventually we may come to function under one unbiased AI, but I doubt it will be in my lifetime. I appreciate the genuine intrigue instead of the usual barrage of defiance, and would love to continue this dialogue. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 04:01:35
That sounds about right. "Once" could be many different dates though, any guess on the year? Relatively recent?

BTMs aren't a rip off. A universal rip off would be a scam, like hidden fees. BTMs have clears fees, often high, because you're paying for the anonymity and quick delivery. 
If the fee is too high, don't use it.
An exchange won't take your $25 visa, but someone on a P2P exchange might. Again, the fees will be higher than an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 04:03:02
I am. What you say on the Internet is forever. Who knows what could happen. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 02:34:56
It's no surprise that bitcoin made it into the commercial. This is a good beginning. Initially people are interested by the gaining value, then they peer deeper and see what really /gives/ bitcoin that value. The technologies, the innovation. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 04:47:36
Yeah, stuck using Coinbase at the moment. Tried Gemeni but I don't have a bill to verify current address, because I don't own the address I live at.
@_date: 2017-01-18 19:59:16
Wow. Did you contact them? 
@_date: 2017-01-15 22:13:38
From this wall of text (that I appreciate) it seems that you know a bit about P2P exchanges. Is it common to have high exchange rates on P2P? It seems most offers are 10% above market rate. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 05:40:03
It's definitely one of the simpler concepts, but true digital scarcity is something unheard of to those raised on Napster and the like. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 02:53:35
Open source. 
Look at Linux and you can see that an open source project will lead to motivated developers. Not necessarily out of financial compensation, but just because they believe in the goal. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 00:34:02
In a digital world we don't need politicians. In a digital world, I can express my opinion without needing representatives that skew the popular vote. 
I completely agree blockchain is applicable in many digital scenarios. When it comes to the physical world, the man with the biggest stick wins. Currently the United States government holds sovereignty (biggest stick) over the North American continent. If they were somehow made "illegal" by the "people", another government would step in. 
@_date: 2017-01-15 22:49:07
Not sure who the "they all" you're talking about is.

@_date: 2017-01-14 02:36:22
I agree with many of them. A cumbersome state isn't required. Force and violence is often used too early with state actors. I think the only thing I disagree with is the global warming. 
I don't see an ancap economy putting reusable energy as a priority when there are cheaper alternatives that damage the environment. Could you maybe expand upon the global warming aspect specifically? 
Feel free to PM me if you'd like to talk 1 on 1. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 00:25:17
Erm. A new and less developed government would take over. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 19:23:16
The falsity here is that bitcoin is /moving/ somewhere, when in fact it's not. The blockchain doesn't care how or where the public key was obtained by the human, be it in space or in a water park, all it cares is that that human has the privkey to the address with the sender's bitcoin. 
With that said, it's definitely good PR. You could get away with sticking a public address to a rocket and calling it a bitcoin transaction in space, even if the transaction never left earth (on the blockchain), since the common public doesn't understand that concept. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 03:27:47
Perhaps I would better benefit if you gave some retorts to the common themes of governmental benefit, such as ways to pay for things that can't be paid for by individuals but are still required by the public, like roads. 
I kind of assumed the benefits were obvious (as well as the penalties), and didn't cite any specific examples, which is a fault on my part. In which case, if this conversation is coming down to a debate on the specific faults and benefits (if any) of a government, I don't know if I wish to have that debate. 
Apart from debating, though, I'd be very interested to hear your viewpoint on the specific aspects of government we have now, as long as you don't mind me just learning and not giving an inverse argument. But that is getting dangerously close to hogging the thread. ;)
I just got home from work and am reading the threads below, and am very glad that this argument has been sparked. It's opening my eyes to a few different things that I previously hadn't considered, which is great. 
@_date: 2017-01-15 22:31:52
Just a fair warning.. I'd prepare for shit. r/bitcoin is going to be fairly disappointed that you didn't write down your recovery phrase. 
With that said - I don't think there's a way to get into your wallet. If you don't have access to the keys you don't own the bitcoin. 
I don't know for sure but I assume once you use up your attempts it will lock you out for a certain amount of time. 
What an expensive lesson. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 19:20:03
And maybe even -1. would be buy a completely new thumb drive.. If we're going all-out paranoid. 
@_date: 2017-01-15 06:17:21
Funny - today I was just thinking about ordering some business cards with a bitcoin QR code on it. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 20:11:20
The fee might be too low. What wallet did you initiate the transaction from? Did you set your own custom fee? 
@_date: 2017-01-23 05:36:51
I don't the OP is HODLing bitcoin for the profit of fiat.
@_date: 2017-01-09 00:56:48
If it were me I would be afraid of losing the drives. 3/5 is a lot to keep track of, especially over years to come. I would suggest using paper wallets instead. If you like the idea of distributing the value to separate places, "work/relatives", then you can do so by dividing your BTC amongst different paper wallets. Though if you're storing them somewhere insecure like at work or with family, I'd recommend encrypting them. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 02:14:22
Wooo! We can all be millionaires, no risk involved!

There are many ways to exchange BTC to USD and vice versa ALL over this subreddit, just look for them. Many of the ones claiming you can spend USD to buy BTC also offer BTC to USD, just check them out. 
If however you don't want to necessarily cash out your bitcoin but instead just want to use it, some of my favorite places to spend my bitcoin are on Steam, Newegg, and purse.io.

@_date: 2017-01-23 21:09:15
It's important to note that a paper wallet is a good balance between cheap/offline storage. Most hardware wallets cost a decent amount.

"The people who got in early took a big risk by /mining/ a new risky and experimental digital asset with no promise to ever get a decent return. These early investors are what gave bitcoin it's initial value and gave liquidity to the market.

Yeah you're misunderstanding what the purpose of verifying the hash is. It's validating the download's integrity, ensuring that the file host (Ubuntu, etc.) hasn't been unknowingly compromised. 
It isn't necessarily redundant, but it's completely paranoid.

My mistake, but MasterUm beat you to it. :P
@_date: 2017-01-14 19:37:04
Neat idea, but I personally am more interested in the economic aspect of what would happen, instead of preventative measures. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 02:46:31
You and I do. If, say, the bitcoin Core dev team did that, anybody who didn't agree would move to a different chain that /does/ have a limit. I'd shut down my core nodes, as would anyone else displeased, and we would move to an altcoin that aligned with what we want. 
@_date: 2017-01-15 22:37:29
My best advice to give would be to do your best to calm down about it and take a step back from the situation. Bad decisions are made in times of panic.

You might be mistaking my use of opinion as like "I like red" for what I'm trying to convey, which I'll take responsibility for. My point was that banks have an ultimate goal, to make money. Their prevailing view is to make money. 
The corrupt portion is rather self explanatory I thought but I'm willing to elaborate if you wish. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 19:36:04
"completely hypothetically". 
@_date: 2017-01-06 10:43:22
That'd be great! Many viewpoints is better than one. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 19:23:47
"for your datacenter", I doubt they're taking home-miners into account. But I agree completely. An up-to-date miner that is less power hungry would be great, obviously to mine at a loss, but still. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 20:15:42
Agreed. But I think (hope) bitcoiners expect this. It's a community that understands that with great power comes great responsibility, you are in charge of your private keys. There is no one holding your hand making sure you get every satoshi that is rightfully yours, and inversely, there is no one holding your hand using your satoshi like it is rightfully theirs. 
@_date: 2017-01-15 21:50:17
Never heard of them, will give them a look though. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 19:41:59
Now I'm confused. When are official "certifications agencies" become a form of government, and when are they not?? 
@_date: 2017-01-15 21:56:47
Just looks like they exchange through Bitfinex.. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 03:18:44
And that's completely fair. I got my best friend interested in bitcoin purely for the ancap aspect. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 02:49:49
I'm honestly not sure what bug you're describing - but I'm not a day trader and don't look into the candlesticks too much. 
@_date: 2017-01-15 21:53:19
I project that I will be buying more, HODLing more, and using more to buy goods or services. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 05:01:49
This guy gets it! xD
@_date: 2017-01-14 19:46:36
Yes, but like I said... I personally am more interested in what would happen economically in a COMPLETELY HYPOTHETICAL scenario, not the preventative measures that show that this can't happen. 
I know it can't happen. I'm saying it's a hypothetical for the thought experiment. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 20:22:36
I used a debit with Circle for a short while and I remember it being free of transaction fees. I believe credit had a fee. Though don't count on me as a beacon of shining light in your reality, my memory has been wrong before.

Fuck systems that are required to function in a capitalistic society yet are intrinsically opinionated and often corrupt. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 17:10:35
Use a paper wallet for any bitcoin you wish to HODL - any you won't be spending often. I use Mycelium as a mobile wallet. 
@_date: 2017-01-15 05:59:02
It doesn't really help to have the full node, is my point. It doesn't matter what your full chain says, unless it matches the majority of chains. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 19:19:25
Between 1. and 2. should be verify hash of Ubuntu ISO.

No clue. Better word choice would be if/when it's lifted. 
@_date: 2017-01-15 06:02:59
Yup. I buy consistent amounts with Coinbase. They haven't screwed me thus far, but I'm not keeping all my eggs in one basket regardless. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 02:31:38
It's not copying bitcoin, it's copying the Fed Reserve - it's a gimmick. No real value besides the artificial value bestowed upon it by a central authority.

While I can't validate your assumption that your friend must be online to get the payment.. I can say that'd be kind of useless. 
If there is no need for "instant" transfer, just use the normal chain with a low fee.

My S/O knows I have bitcoin (which would be hard to hide), just not the amount. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 05:05:49
Erm, yes. I didn't say bitcoin was a technology. I'm saying they see what gives bitcoin (the protocol) value, the miners, nodes, markets, merchants, users, the innovation. Instead of the face value of one bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 04:30:16
Do you use Bitwage or something similar to get paid directly in BTC? 
@_date: 2017-01-10 03:35:43
Completely fair, and I will admit I wrote the response in a hurry. I think my original viewpoint was that they were defending a state governed capitalism. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 14:41:43
I didn't think you would need to know what my investment options are, because you said never sit in fiat. That's all I was wishing for you to clarify, that statement. Your opinion on why one should never sit in fiat (not myself personally, but anyone) is what I was getting at. 
@_date: 2017-01-15 06:28:07
OSINT engaged. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 02:59:46
It's public information that I'm 18 years old, everything else would be rather silly to disclose. 
@_date: 2016-11-27 21:55:27
Hm. I'm a poor college student with ~$2000 in static savings. Static meaning I don't withdraw any of it for any reason, I can support myself without touching it. Right now it's in fiat in some bank... 
Should I move it to Bitcoin, or perhaps even a Bitcoin compound interest service such as Magnr? Currently I'm putting about 6% of my income into BTC each month regardless of what happens with that static savings. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 20:27:21
Arbitrary distinction. If I get X amount of bits for writing an article, that's the same thing as them giving me an equal amount of $X but it automatically "buys" into bitcoin. Either way you've exchanged a service or product for value. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 23:09:13
Same. I tried sending a picture of a prescription bottle with my name and address but they denied it obviously. Will try what Treasonaire suggested. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 20:55:21
I don't like how it incorporates the USA's flag. Bitcoin isn't tied to a government, and therefore should not incorporate any entity's flag. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 02:20:57
Well obviously. That's how I made it on the Internet. When I say "should" I'm not literally asking what I should do, it's a way to informally ask for an opinion. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 20:08:35
Not sure what's scarier - that they may have suspended it without communication, or that they don't know /why/ it's suspended. 
May I ask why you were keeping so much BTC with Coinbase? 
@_date: 2016-11-03 18:33:21
At least tip him some BTC. ;)
@_date: 2017-01-08 05:22:21
I have been thinking about mining at a loss, just to support the network. Hoping this thread will yield useful responses.

I don't think it wipes it, but I believe there's a wait time that gets longer after incorrect attempts, like on KeepKey.

Here's the tweet I linked to the YouTube vid :P Feel free to share it as you please. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 15:11:05
You'll rarely get the proponents of both fast and high limits. Something like Bitwage would work best for long term usage, you send a portion of your direct paycheck to them and they pay you in bitcoin. It's relatively fast and has high limits, but you can't pay with a credit card, so there's that. 
You could try purse.io. Bitcoin will cost a bit more there since it's P2P, but basically you just fulfill an Amazon order that someone wants, and they'll give you bitcoin. 
You spend your credit card and get Amazon to ship it to them, once their items arrive the bitcoin is released from escrow. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 21:27:33
Or you could put a paper wallet in a plastic bag, but the digital aspect is cool. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 05:39:43
Dude that's awesome xD

Here's the scene from this episode with a little twist: 
@_date: 2017-04-03 02:34:20
Hmmm you could get an extension for downloading YouTube videos or I could throw up a torrent somewhere. 
@_date: 2016-10-17 21:32:33
Wouldn't the public key be on the blockchain when initially sending funds to the paper wallet? 
@_date: 2016-10-15 21:49:46
I think they start at $300 a week. 
@_date: 2016-10-12 01:19:15
I'd use it. 
@_date: 2016-10-14 19:15:05
What's a terribly low limit to you?
@_date: 2016-10-16 22:20:08
Searches for banks and taxes also went up. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 20:17:03
Link? Or is it deleted?
@_date: 2016-10-07 18:56:17
Right. If you wanted to achieve close to the same thing on YouTube's website you could do so just by leaving an address in the description I guess. 
@_date: 2016-10-17 00:41:52
This looks neat. Basically the only reason I'm running Bitcoin Core is to support the network. 
Ran into a problem though, it seems I need a referral username? Is the registration a closed beta? 
@_date: 2016-10-16 22:08:58
Hey, at least you've used this scenario to remind others of the importance of backups. 
@_date: 2016-10-07 16:42:14
So this only works if you're putting your YouTube videos on your own website? Isn't most viewing done through YouTube's website? 
@_date: 2016-10-14 16:18:43
Thanks! :)

Yes you can, if you go through private retailers selling those items. And I'm pretty sure there are even established exchanges that deal in Gold/BTC. If you're really complaining about your BTC you can send it to me. 1BHW8agpbAhqHdtaqLS11oU3qsm54rosSK

To the common man the attention that Bitcoin gets is from illegal transactions and news stories that exaggerate Bitcoin's involvement in hacker culture. I would argue that this isn't good attention at all because anyone who might have wanted to adopt Bitcoin are now afraid to because they don't want to be associated with that "hacker culture". They don't see the benefit of a decentralized currency if they're not developing ransomware.
