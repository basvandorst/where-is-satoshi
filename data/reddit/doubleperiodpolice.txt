gotta be honest, I'm mostly doing this too. I'm sure a CPA would flip their shit but my approach to taxes has always been "pay as close to the right amount as you can and the IRS won't flag it, no matter how you documented it or reported it."
been fine my whole life. there's been self-employed years where I didn't even document biz expenses, I just put an appropriately lower income. never had an issue. just can't deal with the forms, man

He's literally admitting he doesn't know what will happen and putting percentage ranges on what he thinks might happen. He couldn't be any more cautious/open-minded in what he's saying. In fact, he's barely saying anything. Yet you act like he's a clueless person making sweeping predictions about exactly what will happen while stroking your own ego about how long youve been here and how integrated you might be with the community and feeling superior because *youre* smart enough to know we can't predict anything in crypto.
Fuck outta here

You're arguing with an unintelligent zealot. He demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of what cash flow means in this statement:


And then continues to argue like an idiot with no understanding of the original point.
