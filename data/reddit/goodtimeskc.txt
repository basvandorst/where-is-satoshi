I guess it depends on what kind of data can be stored on the block chain.  If you can’t set up a system that identifies when real world conditions are met that, once met, communicates with the block chain that the smart contract condition has been met, then I don’t know.  In that scenario the only information stored on the block chain is the condition/counterparties/exchange.  Everything else is coming from outside.

What is happening with the price of real estate in Argentina right now
@_date: 2018-08-15 02:27:10
You need to have dollars to make investments and pay taxes in the US.  Your loans are also denominated in them.
You need yen to do the same in Japan.
No one will ever *need* a bitcoin.  That’s why it never succeeds.  The only way it would is if Venezuela, for instance, determines that bitcoin is better than their own currency and adopts it, making all transactions in the country now done in bitcoin.  And they would accept it because it has immediate value, relatively stable and proven value, and it would involve the state receiving most or all of the nakamoto ownership piece.
Only then would bitcoin have the “need” factor and then it could be worth anything.  
@_date: 2018-08-14 14:36:27

Smart contracts can be utilized on a much more micro-level than what is being discussed in most conversations about potential uses.  What if you had a very detailed business plan in place, but there were multiple places were the variables and parties changed.  You could set up a decision tree utilizing smart contracts for all scenarios that would instantly trigger when certain conditions are met.  Now think bigger.  Those counterparties are also using smart contracts, have decision trees in place.  If you could see these webs of contracts at a macro level you can now predict the future.  Think insurance or derivatives.

It will never be a generally acceptable safe haven for anyone inside or outside the US as long as USD is where the US is transacting 24% of the world’s business and has the most stable currency in the world.  That’s what USD is for and why people and other governments across the world hold dollars.
The only way it works is the the government of that country gives up on their own failed currency and immediately only recognizes bitcoin.

It’s stable because people **need** dollars to do business in the US.  Has nothing to do with amount of debt or the fact it is fiat currency and controlled to the benefit of the US.  As long as we control global trade the ride never stops.
The point remains, though.  Everyone has to have their own.  The only way their can be only one bitcoin is if there were only one country.  Even then, regional trade being dictated in regional coin makes the most sense.
Maybe every city could even have their own with exchange rates being monitored on a micro level to facilitate business, boost local trade or cool it as necessary.

Yikes.  Sonic thoughts is right.. might want to look into something to slow those down.
First, you put idiots in quotes as if I wrote that.  Reread my post - I clearly didn't. 
What drove up the price in 2017?  FOMO, widespread news coverage, and people piling into something they didn't understand at all with the expectation of getting rich overnight.  Bitcoin is still very much full of those people.  I can hear it in their posts.  Clinging to the naive hope that the thing they still do not understand will still bring them the money to fulfill their wildest dreams.  I mean.. read the rest of the posts on this thread.
You obviously take all of this too personally so maybe you are one of those people too.  I don't give two shits what you do with your money.  I'm just speaking the truth.  If you can't handle it maybe you should think about why that is and get real with yourself.

You can spend it at about 5% of the places I can use a credit card.  I’ll sell you a futures contract on my left nut too.  Retail transactions aren’t made *easier* or *better* as a result of bitcoin, there is no payment innovation and as a result using bitcoin for retail payments would be a lateral move at best.  I use Venmo to send cash to friends like everyone else.  Matter of fact, bitcoin “hodlers” as a whole probably do the same, given that they are so strongly entrenched in the “moon” potential of bitcoin.  It’s a useless commodity, without innovation making it *better* or *more useful* than the current system it will die off in obscurity.
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:28:58
The point isn't whether or not I understand it.  In a market based system where the price of bitcoin is based on what others are willing to pay for it, the fact that relatively few participants have even a remote understanding of bitcoin, the vast majority of participants engaging in completely speculative gambling, is not a good look for the price.  Regardless of the future utility of bitcoin, this dumb money has vastly overpriced the coin and will continue to do so.  If any of the dumb participants ever make a return on their money, it will be complete luck and reliant upon things they don't understand.  So be stubborn and hodl on guys.. who knows, this thing might eventually be worth something.  When the dust settles, though, it's very likely that something is completely different than any current valuation of the coin based on ridiculous growth models and adoption.
Edit:  I'll add this too.  The price of bitcoin is 100% tied to speculation and random bullshitting.  You're going to be much better off in the short and long term selling your bitcoin and just buying meme stocks that is talking about which, at it's core, is the same thing that bitcoin mania is all about.

@_date: 2018-06-25 21:01:17
Then we come at the conversation from opposite vantage points.  You see the tech first.  I admittedly don't have that background, but I do know more than most.  My background is in finance/economics and I currently work in investments (sales).  I watch the price movements and read the motivations of the people in forums like this and it is very telling of the state of the market, regardless of whether the tech changes the world or it doesn't.  Just by sheer logic based upon the sophistication and motivation of the current market participants, bitcoin *has* to be overpriced currently.  I'll never be wrong about that.  However... the tech could succeed, the value could skyrocket, and even the least sophisticated bitcoin buyer will be a winner.  That's the nature of accepting risk.  Until I see less stupid posts and more useful applications of the tech and higher acceptance as a currency, though, it just doesn't look appealing.  I sell "blue sky" all day in my current business.  Bitcoin has the biggest amount of blue sky conceivable - replacing the currencies of the world.
Here's something, though.  Why would TPTB ever allow bitcoin to replace all currencies?  Wouldn't they fight to kill bitcoin and replace it with something they do control?  Look at China right now.  I just read an article today about how they are actively promoting alternatives to bitcoin domestically, not even acknowledging it's existence as a top crypto.
If you assume that at some point governments would try to either end, capture, or replace bitcoin because it is undermining their own currencies and their ability to create fiat money and borrow, then what is all this really leading to?
Money is more than a means of exchange.
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:20:26
The current market cap of bitcoin is 107b USD.  Assuming you understand the tech and its applications, the price is still beyond ridiculous for an alternative currency that is still in its infancy.  Maybe if that market cap drops to 20b or so in a year or two and the tech continues to improve it might eventually be worth another look.  As it sits, it's on overhyped meme with no price support outside of speculation.
@_date: 2018-06-26 23:08:59

Have you ever considered why a freely fluctuating exchange rate between international currencies is beneficial in allocation of resources globally?  If anything, an innovation in the space of digital money would allow for even greater localization or even hyperlocalization of money supply and exchange rates.  I would even argue that the United States is a prime example of the need for that sort of innovation with its extreme diversity of regional economies, it would be a godsend to midwestern farmers who are on the verge of losing their farms right now.

Bitcoin still has not proven to anyone but the lowest informed HODLers that it is a better alternative than current means.  There is no option where bitcoin is an alternative means of exchange and also worthy of anything close to its current value.
I have literally never had a conversation with a bitcoin owner who has any compelling knowledge of bitcoin that would make me believe otherwise and I'm totally open to it.  Just haven't heard the argument that leaves me thinking anything other than worthless or extremely overpriced.
Another thing.  If I've spoken with ~20 bitcoin holders irl and literally every one of them is beyond clueless, what does that say about the price of bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-06-16 18:59:48
Let’s see.. 18 months ago was December 16th 2017, peak bitcoin price to the day almost.  If you bought two bitcoins on December 17th that would have cost you $39,566 USD.  Today, those two bitcoins would be worth $18,159 USD for a **net loss of $21,407**.  Hardly “watch your value double”...

Income producing real estate is, and always has been, the most tried and true path to acquiring and storing wealth and securing financial independence.  Bitcoin as a mechanism for storing value is fundamentally inefficient from an macro perspective.  The capital deployed in bitcoin produces no value, creates no returns (other than speculative), and, in the long term, will be viewed as wasted capital that could be better deployed in other investment classes.
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:26:58
I mean.. if you're upside down in this and going to hodl at least give yourself a better chance at breaking even.  If he bought 2x the amount he bought at 19k while it was at 8k, his average cost/BTC would be like 11.5k.  Much easier to achieve than the current ATH.  Again.. assuming it doesn't go straight to zero.
I actually have a theory that the only real price support BTC will have in the coming months, and maybe ever, will come from people chasing losses.  Someone will end up holding the bag though for all the people that have exited this thing with profit.

@_date: 2018-12-02 16:08:45
And what do you think the market cap could grow to exactly?  It’s not a currency.  No one uses it as such.  What function will bitcoin serve in “the financial sphere”?  Bitcoin futures are trading down not up.  There is a large boot standing on the face of bitcoin saying price will go down.  Same as gold and silver.  I don’t want this all to be lost on you, though.  Feel free to do some actual research.
