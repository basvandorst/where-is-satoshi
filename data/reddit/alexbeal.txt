The price is normalized between $0 and $10. If you buy a long share for $6 and the broncos win, then the contract "settles" at $10, meaning you make $4. If they lose, it settles at $0, meaning you lose $6.
If you buy a long share for $6, this means you think there's at least a 60% chance of them winning, because this is where your expected value is $0. The calculation is:
(0.6 * $4) + (0.4 * $-6) = $0

A few days ago my coinbase balance disappeared for about 12 hours. Some people are also reporting negative balances. After my balance came back I transferred the coins out ASAP. It's much more than just their purchasing service having issues.

Glad to hear it! Mine are still gone, but hopefully this means they'll get around to my account soon.

A similar thing has happened to me. I tried to transfer 5 BTC out to my private wallet, and now the transaction and coins are gone. Still waiting on a reply to my support request. The fact that this isn't isolated, and someone on the frontpage even reported that they received too many BTC is making me nervous.

Thanks for the update. It's crazy to me that they're allowing people to make transactions despite a bug in their account balance code, but hopefully this will all be worked out soon.

I was a bit skeptical that tamar was really from Namecheap (sorry, tamar), but ~~he~~ she sent me a tweet through the Namecheap account. I'm a believer: 
Awesome news!

I got a second copy of this email today. Amazingly the phising site is still up. Sending heroku another email...

Thanks! I'm glad you found it useful/interesting. I had fun putting it together.

Possibly stupid question: Is bitcoin-central the same as instawallet? They are displaying the same security breach messages.

I'm experiencing an error too, but this one is *not* in my favor. I tried to send 5 BTC from coinbase. Now the transaction is gone, and so are my coins. The coins were never sent. I'm now waiting on a reply to my support request.
The fact that other people are receiving coins they shouldn't have is making me nervous. In my opinion they should freeze all transactions until they figure this out.
