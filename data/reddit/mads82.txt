Not diversifying enough, thought I could pick the winners. Combined with the buying US stocks as a European, and the USD exchange rate dropping over 12%. Well, lessons learned. ETFs for me in the future. I'll leave my speculation for crypto, more exciting anyway :)

You can usually trade it for BNB, even small amounts. And then trade it to something else, or use it for fees.

I got -15% return last year in stocks :(
But I made twice that in crypto in the last 3 weeks...

An amount of people will buy/sell at a certain price, and put in a trade order for that price.
E.g. if 100 people want to sell 10 BTC each for 10.000 USD and put in that order, it will create a wall for 1,000 BTC at  the 10.000 USD level. Before moving lower than that sell point, it will have to 'break down the wall' at 10.000 (the 1,000 BTC will have to be sold at 10.000 USD).

If you're not already in, I would wait a few days to see where it settles. Don't try to catch it on the way down.

Crypto is not regulated. Pros and cons.

I believe that this is the beginning of the end for BTC being the dominant coin (marked share terms), but time will tell. But BTC will lead both up and down for the time being.

I would use bitcoin in daily life, if I could use it on my visa card. Doesn't really matter to me if it was crypto to crypto or crypto to fiat purchases. As long as I could hold my money in crypto and spend it as a normal credit card.
