Freicoin would be the perfect system to prevent hoarding, being is much fairer and direct than a central banking system with inflation. At the same time it solves the problem of rewarding miners quiet elegantly. 
However in direct competition to other cryptocurrencies it won't have any success because as soon as you use it you loose money. It would only work if it were mandated by law.

And this is exactly the problem with a deflating currency. It is bad for merchants. This is why the Bitcoin will fail if it doesn't implement techniques like demurrage soon. Because if not the bitcoin economy will stay as small as it is now and bitcoins will only be used as medium for speculation but not for transfering value.
@_date: 2011-05-29 09:50:46
There are two kinds of deflation.
One is caused by an oversupply of goods, like it is the case with consumer electronics. This kind of deflation is good!
The second one is caused by a lack of liquidity, because people are holding their money back and only pay for stuff that they need to survive. This kind of deflation is bad! It kills jobs and halts any kind of progress, because the risk of trying something new are too high.

The effect on consumer behavior will be very different, because they will hold back life essential purchases because they are not able to pay it today.
If you are hungry but you only can afford that apple if you wait until the end of the week, this is not a world i would want to live in.
Also, the economy does not consist of consumers only. For entrepreneurs, merchants and businesses deflation caused by a lack of liquidity leads to less investments, means less jobs, productivity and progress.

is it?
@_date: 2011-05-26 01:01:29
The Deflation of the Bitcoin occures, because right now the Bitcoin economy is growing faster than the supply of Bitcoins itself.
In my opinion the best concept to maintain liquidity, reward miners and at the same time keep the amount of money constant is the so called freicoin. 
With the freicoins you have to pay a fee for every transaction to the miner on the basis of how long you have kept your money. The longer you keep it the more you have to pay. This makes hoarding less profitable, pressures you a little to spend your money and therefore keeps the money flowing. 
Btw. this functionality can easily be added to the current Bitcoin network since the rules by which fees are determined are not yet implemented.
@_date: 2011-05-21 11:33:03
Difficulty is rising exponential and technical analysis show that the Bitcoin will correct itself down to a value between 1$ and 2$.
As long as you don't get electricity for free, mining won't be profitable in the near future. 
So if you are buying your mining hardware now you are basically too late.

You are raising a valid point. It it possible do design a mining algorithm which would do scientific useful things like solving complex integrals with Monte Carlo integration. The difficulty would then be something like the size of the error of the computed value. I have colleagues working on QCD lattice theory and the main limiting factor for them to move forward is really just the lack of computing power. 
Computing stupid sha256 hashes is indeed a big waste of time and energy.

Forget HFT. MtGox is to slow for that.
However, to get realtime market data (trades and orders) you have to use the MtGox Streaming API which works with socket.io. In my experience it is very unstable and has random disconnects. If the market is moving fast it doesn't work at all, so most of the time you don't have an up-to-date orderbook and for prices you have to resort to the plain old ticker via http. 
To submit actual orders you should use API v0 because with my tests it worked way faster than API v1. Also Api v0 is the only one which allows you to cancel orders.

Deflation won't be a problem because there will be many forks and competing currencies. As soon as it is clear that bitcoin just consists of a bunch of hoarders who don't use their currency anyway, competing currencies with better money flow will take over and bitcoin will loose its value petty quickly. 
@_date: 2013-02-19 10:07:41
To me there is no doubt, that in the future we all will use crypto currency exclusively. However, there will be many competing crypto currencies which could also mean that a bitcoin might never be worth more than 100$.

My former mining computer now servers as trading bot, calculating permanently the best possible trading strategies from former price movements using the Monte Carlo method.
I don't care about prices going up or down any more. It will make money in most cases anyway. The only thing that counts is that it stays as volatile as it is now. Because even though it is absolutely not practical as a currency this way, I can easily rip off panicking day traders.

Currencies exist since thousands of years and they work best when they are stable. Runaway inflation is as harmful as runaway deflation. If I don't know if the price of a pizza could be up to 40% different between today and next week the currency is not practical at all. 
That is the reason why all prices are made in dollar and then eventually converted into BTC. But still, Merchants and buyers have to take huge risks to take quick price BTC changes into account. If you want to ensure against them you pay comparable fees to credit card payment systems.
So in the end there are not many advantages left.

Let the computer do it for you.
Bitcoin is ideal for that for two reasons:

* People trading Bitcoin are trading like sheep. Easy to predict.

@_date: 2013-03-28 08:52:41


You have to teach this yourself I guess. But I have some recommendations for Mt.Gox: Use for everything where possible the APIv0 because this is the fastest. The streaming socket.io API doesn't work most of the time and if it works it is way to slow. In order to save time you should ignore it completely. For ticker data use APIv1 because for some reason prices there are more recent than the ones on APIv0. I use Python for everything, but there are examples for all kinds of languages. Matlab won't help you there though, because most of the stuff is boiler plate code. The actual simulation code is something like 20 lines of python.


Bitcoin is better than Forex because Bitcoin is way more volatile. Also it behaves like something I would call a "sheep market". If some people buy all the sheep are following suit and start to buy as well. The same for selling. This means it is very easy to predict the market, all you have to do is being among the first sheep. 


I ususally only take data from the past week. So more data doesn't really help you that much. My simulation has several input parameters for the trading algorithm, like "stop" and "go" and one output parameter: profit. What you essentially do is scanning the input parameter space with random numbers in order to find local maxima of the value "profit", this is what I meant with Monte Carlo method. Since the Bitcoin price resembles something like an exponential shape those input parameters are changing constantly. So if you take more than one month of former price movements your algorithm is getting worse.
@_date: 2013-04-09 06:13:43
I still don't understand how Bitcoin is useful for something other than big players screwing small investors with wild speculation.
With this kind of volatility it is certainly not useful as medium of exchange at all.

I did exactly that. Now some of my money lies somewhere at bitcoin-24 inaccessible for months. 
Mt.Gox might have some hiccups now and then, but i'm glad that I have the majority of my money still there. It is also ideal for miners because you get the best prices there.

Solution: Implement the trading engine in C so that it just gets passed a few integers per order. Instead of SQL databases use structs and pointers, everything stays in RAM. Finally, demand a fee for cancelling orders to avoid deliberate orderbook spamming. 
With a system like this one PC from 2004 could handle a few hundred thousand orders per second.

Speculation has nothing to do with being productive. Speculators are the main reason for the volatility we are experiencing right now.

The prices were rising too high too fast since January. The bitcoin economy did not realistically grow 1000% per month within that time. 
So everything that goes up fast will evetually go down fast. 
30$ is a good price considering the current size of the bitcoin economy. 
People investing now just want to profit from the big swings, high volatility and speculation. They don't need bitcoins for anything really.

I think we are bouncing against the daily SMA200 hard like in the last bubble. This means shorttem we are going back to 90+. However, after that the SMA will be broken and the bottom will be lower than 30.
Reason: Miners with ASICs make huge profits right now. In that case (whenever a new mining technology arrived) the price always corrected itself down until mining was barely profitable.
@_date: 2013-03-01 09:35:44
The hoarding will not lead to ever increasing prices. It will lead to high instability which we already are experiencing right now. Irrational swings of 20% within minutes, this is hardly a practical currency. 


I completely disagree. Even small things like the blocksize limit can make all the difference. If something goes seriously wrong there a competing currency can take over within a week.

I'm pretty sure most people assume that it will reach at least 50$ and more. Cashing out now means you speculate for a little drop to buy back. But there are lots of people waiting for a "little drop" as entry point. It might just not happen. The risk you have to take for a little short term profit might not be worth it.
