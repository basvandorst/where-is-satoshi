Dogecoin is far closer to Satoshi's original vision of peer to peer electronic currency than bcash, as transactions take a few minutes at most and it is actually used as currency because its joke nature discourages hoarding it, unlike bcash, which only a few people accept and is mainly hoarded by people who want bcash to flip Bitcoin. Although Bitcoin's network congestion is problematic and a lot of people hoard it, at least people are actually using it.

A blocksize change would require a hard fork, which could lead to the creation of another coin like BCH. The devs want to wait until there's more features to deploy before they fork in order to minimize the number of forks.

It's a given that less established and thus riskier cryptos can yield better returns at the cost of less stability. For example, let's look at two altcoins that were commonly talked about on the cryptocurrency board of 4ch: *Power Ledger* and *Confido*. If I had bought Power Ledger 2 weeks ago, I would have made 5x my initial investment. On the other hand, buying Confido would have resulted in a 98% loss after it was revealed to be a scam.
That's why I'm content with just holding BTC.

I'll fill in while he's gone as I traded all my DOGE for BTC years ago and have been hodling since then.

Dogecoin might be a shadow of what it once was, but we will never forget its role in introducing many new people to the crypto world.

1 DOGE = 1 DOGE
1 BTC = 4347826 DOGE
If BTC wins, everybody wins since I now have more DOGE!

Paypal -&gt; BTC has very high fees because of the risk of chargeback fraud. You'd be better off withdrawing the money to your bank account then transferring it to Coinbase/GDAX.

[This guy lost 10k shorting BTC, and had logs to prove it.]( I'm for love in crypto and all, but when you try to execute a hostile fork of course the doges are going to bite back.

He can sign transactions with his key or something like that to prove he is the owner of a given address. Do note that he might have sent from an exchange address instead of a personal wallet one, the address the exchange sends from is usually different from the address that one receives from.
