I think the GTA 5 PC download was more than that to be honest with you.  If you think 35gb is a lot of space with a 1tb hd can be picked up for less than $50.00, I don't really know what to tell you.  I have USB drives with more space than that.

Not sure why you are being downvoted.  The amount of times I have said goodbye and returned are way more than the times I said goodbye and never returned.  This isn't specifici to reddit either.

He can't raise fabrication to something he wasn't being charged with.  That's what makes it all bullshit.  He can't protest because he's not charged with it, but the judge gets to consider it as if it were a fact.  No murder for hire = no violent criminal enterprise which means no life sentence.

You realize the point of an analogy isn't to be exactly the same situation right?

Rofl, sorry "if" you were abrasive?  AKA, since it now appears you  agree with me, I will appoligize for my behavior, which I won't explicitly admit to.

The judge was able to consider the accussation of him attempting to solicit 6 murders for hire AS IF IT WERE FACT, without having to prove a damn thing.  That definitely played a substantial role in deciding to send this guy to life in prison.  If there was no murder for hire accussation then there was no violent criminal enterprise to worry about, and the idealistic DPR gets a bit more than the minimum and then rebuilds his life.  Not to mention that the trumped up murder for hire bullshit is what the whole case started as.  Funny how the focus of the investigation doesn't even wind up with a charge at trial.  Reeks of fabrication.

Where can I found out more information about theymos?  Have never heard the name before and am surprised to find out how much power they have.

Coin.mx is great when it works.  If you ever have to contact customer service prepare yourself for a bad time.  They are extremely rude, unprofessional and lie like it's their job.  I ended my use of their service after my bitcoin was tied up for 5 days while I kept getting the run around by support.  It was such bs.

Let's not pretend bitcoin isn't made out of thin air too.  Some of you want bitcoin to succeed so much you have completely distorted wtf bitcoin is/isn't anymore.
