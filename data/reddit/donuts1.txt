His bank certainly would have a 24hr fraud line to call. He just decided to wait to call customer service instead. 
If you your card is declined you can always call that 24hr number and they can tell you why it was declined or anything wrong with your account.

Do withdrawals from bitstamp.net in fiat, in currencies other than usd, also lose a percentage on an exchange rate? I might have to withdraw in aud... Am I going to lose another 2 or 3% to forex fees?

Coinbase is connected to GDAX. GDAX pay the withdrawal fees for you. 
You can put your coins from coinbase to GDAX for free then send from GDAX to whoever/yourself for free. Never send with coinbase.

But you don't have to be super invested
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:10:21
You could have done that for free through gdax. If your on coinbase you automatically have a gdax account.

I have nothing. Except massive credit balances
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:46:06
I agree. I just want to hear some other arguments to dispute that.... be critical don't live in an echo chamber

I'm hodl btc.. but I'm a newbie.. Just posting something that other newbies might be thinking
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:32:01
I'm a long time lurker, first time poster in this crypto space...  I feel this was a good newb question
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:26:55
I feel like maxing outall my credit cards on bitcoin. Just sell enough when I have to
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:01:11
Let's start that conversation
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:10:32
yeah.. just wish everyone would go long! haha :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:20:59
strange. my instincts are
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:31:41
If no one is willing to buy the price will never get that high in the first place. Basic supply and demand. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:14:02
This is exactly it.

If they all sell others will buy it up and the whales will lose their power? 
I believe they will (or have and are) selling and rebuying for 20% lower or more.  
20% of hundreds of millions is still millions. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:59:54
Exactly that. We aint going back from block chain 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:07:58
Exactly. Being the original doesn't mean the best
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:51:43
Sounds weird... but I want to listen to some counter argument... not struck in an echo chamber.
Please don't get me wrong I'm 109% andreas
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:22:49
Its a hedge. sell 100m worth and buy the same amount for lower. You have $20m in fiat and the same amount of bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:28:44
New to the space... convince me
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:32:48
I just know as soon as I buy in it will dip again...
