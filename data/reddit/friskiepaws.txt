Waltonchain - 
There is no way a blockchain like Bitcoin could match or catch up to the years of hardware work that has gone into a project like Walton.

The hardware companies and team behind Waltonchain. Have been working towards this for years. Keep reading the article. There are sources in there that will give you all the answers to questions that you might have.
Here's the team:

No. Reading that complete article would tell you exactly why it's special. I'll just say that the companies and team behind the project didn't start their work in 2016. That's just the date they launched this collective project to the world. Keep reading that's my advice. If you think IoT and blockchain combination will be huge vertical in the years ahead, then Waltonchain is a project you don't want to miss.

Yeah man no joke. I'm certainly not laughing. Also there is no way you just read that article I posted. Anyways just sharing the knowledge to those with an open mind. People in crypto are way too protective / tribal with the coins they hodl. It's currently hurting the space.

I'm going to get my head ripped off here but I don't care :) First off let me say I love BTC, always have, always will. 
That being said I have ventured outside the main land, and invested in a few solid "real world" application projects. One of those is Waltonchain. Now before you "rip" my head off. I'm asking you to remain objective and read this recent article that did a great job covering the scope of the project: 
Just because a seasoned, battle tested blockchain like BTC has a smart contract layer via RSK, lightening network for instant transactions, and sidechains doesn't mean the blockchain can cover every industry. There is no internal team or external team that is going to develop the "hardware" layers and business relationships to match the aim of Walton's team. This is just my view. I'd appreciate a discussion around this not a "get lost" response. I don't think that helps move the discussion forward in any way.
