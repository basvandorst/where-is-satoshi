Ron Paul adviced on Buying BTC instead of retirement fund monthly payments. And I think this is kind of true. Like really.
@_date: 2019-06-25 08:25:37
Actually yes, because Bitcoin is decentralized (no entity controls it), its price is not dependent on any single government, it is defliationary and only 21 million btc will ever exist. Also, Bitcoin's permissionless blockchain lets the miners simply begin mining at their discretion. Bitcoin is kind of fantastic asset for people.

Just focus, relax and do not be overhyped. A small retracement to 8500-9000 levels could act as even bigger pre-fomo catalyst.  It's like the "deep breath" before the launch.
