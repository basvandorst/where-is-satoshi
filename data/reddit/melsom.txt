Bitcoin as a currency likely won't have any effect on financial firms. The Blockchain technology, however, could have the potential to be hugely disruptive to investment banks. Blockchain technology represents a  significant improvement to how securities are currently issued, distributed and traded. Straight off, clearing houses, the DTC and transfer agents could be completely disintermediated seeing as the record keeping would be unnecessary. Settlement would be instantanous rather than the current T+3. Buy side firms would be able to trade directly with one another without going through a broker. Companies will be able to directly issue debt and effect to the market without the need for an investment banker. 
Now this is all in the future. At least in the short term, the Blockchain tech companies will have no interest in becoming regulated entities, so any company that wants to use Blockchain for a primary issuance will still have to work with an investment bank. Longer term, it's less clear. It would be logical for investment banks to work with the technology in case it becomes a standard, but doing so is like big oil investing in Cleantech. 
Edit: Removed reference to my comments between the distinction between Bitcoin and the Blockchain which, as the commenters below noted, was incorrect.

This is true of securities. It's not true of Bitcoin. Using the logic above, you'd need to report your conversion to Euros when you're planning that vacation to Greece. Now, if you purchased a security that was a derivative of bitcoin's price, you would have to report to compliance.
