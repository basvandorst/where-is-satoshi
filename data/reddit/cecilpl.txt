Sure, I never said it was the fault of cash. Usually when that happens, the problem is the banking system isn't well-regulated enough. Problems like this is exactly why there are banking regulations.


Of course they are large. For years they made up the majority of the bitcoin ecosystem. They were the most well-known exchange.
