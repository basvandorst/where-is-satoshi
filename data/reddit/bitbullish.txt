By that logic they should charge $100 per transaction! The point is the market is going to change because people are getting gouged. 


Yea, but people are using it for microtransactions. The idea of this post is to say bitcoin is going to eat paypal's lunch if they don't get moving on their own BTC adoption.

It's a dumb phrase and I would otherwise agree with you but I think this is definitely an example of it. People don't need to know anything about bitcoin to use reddit notes, but they're absolutely using bitcoin.
It turns out that in the short term people actually *will* use bitcoin without even knowing it. Trojan Horse

If we have 1000% growth in 2015 people are going to notice in a very big way. 
The media has no perspective and central banks and governments have obvious incentive to play bitcoin down ("it's not a currency, the block chain is pretty cool though"). That leaves business to generate hype, and I'm sure Microsoft would rather have you pay with BTC and have 0% transaction fees so we're going to see some positive PR out of companies that would rather be accepting bitcoin than mastercard. Just a matter of time in my opinion. Hopefully not another bum year, but this is too big to stop paying attention.

It's going to be tough to call this thing a bubble twice.

Can anybody think of a single metric that was down this year other than price?

Seth handled it well IMO. I respect the honesty and it was about what I expected. Nothing to see here, except to note the OP is kind of a dick.

You have -100 comment karma.
You're going to be perpetually disappointed if you continue to declare bitcoin dead. Why does Microsoft accept these tulips for payment?

The backbreaker is that they simply wont. VC money is going to grow this, not large established financial institutions. They're too big to fail so they're too big to innovate.

When you calculate how much a transaction costs in USD do you factor in inflation of the currency supply and divide it among the number of transactions?
Bitcoin clearly doesn't cost $14 per transaction. 
It *does* have 10% inflation which will be cut down over time. If this gets anywhere near mass adoption the number of transactions will either increase significantly bringing in revenue to miners or the cost of transactions *on the blockchain* will increase and off blockchain transactions will become more common.

Is gold taxed like this there?

This is a great example of when people say "people will use bitcoin without even knowing it."

Coinbase alone is valued at $500 million

He's basically talking about smart contracts. 
His next book should probably be about Nick Szabo.

Twice in the eyes of the media. Journalists don't do their research.

A hacker stole 300BTC from blockchain.info last week. Maybe more, I didn't follow the whole thing. He returned the stolen coins but the point is blockchain.info has been under a lot of heat for having shitty security.
