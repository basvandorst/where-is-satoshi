Thanks for that.

Thank you Andreas!

It was built on Ethereum!

Yes. Check this infographic of Satoshi's white-paper.

I'm confused about the mechanics of the reported inflation exploit. 
If producing a "bad" block is needed, but any unpatched nodes would crash when validating such a block, how could it ever be added to the canonical chain?

I made an order recently but did notice you didn't accept cryptos. Not sure I will be a recurring customer....

Bitstamp is fully licensed in the EU but Kraken is also quite easy to work with from here.

Wasn't Blockstream developing KYC software or was that just an urban legend?

I'll roll one up for you...

We're late to the meme party. :-/

But then they wouldn’t be unique digital assets. Nfts are non-fungible as the name suggests.

It seems to me that if by the time block rewards are extinguished the value of the assets on the canonical chain will still be worth a dollar value and their owners will have a strong interest in maintaining or increasing it. I think it would be natural to assume that exchanges / LN business dealing with the assets directly would still find it profitable to maintaining and supporting the block producing function, even if by then PoW is replaced with some form of PoS.

Eh? Didn't this guy say Bitcoin was only useful for buying drugs a couple of years back...

Think of it this way, even the most successful VCs get about 75% bad apples. 
ICOs are great but investors need to be careful and look around for information on the product, market, team, etc. Just like investing in startups with any other investment vehicle.

(IANAL) It's my understanding that if the terms of the contract do not assure prospective investors a financial gain from the tokens sold (ie, if they are platform access tokens or something of that sort) it would not count as a security.
There is also another interesting perspective to this and that is the possibility of _acting_ on the promise of "history's biggest transfer of capital" and bring blockchain projects and investments outside of the... usual places, but I digress.

What about ICOs that explicitly exclude US based investors or otherwise state that the tokens sold have no guarantee of financial return?
@_date: 2017-07-26 10:50:38
Well, on the blockchain nobody knows you are an American so you will be fine ;-)

True but they may have different interpretations as the underlying laws and acts supporting the SEC are specific to the US.

I wonder if Milo meets the requirements to be a PEP. If that's the case, he'll find it hard to open any account with a regulated financial institution.
