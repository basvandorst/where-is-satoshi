Backstory - I am a social entrepreneur with a technology company on a mission to cut out the global food system middlemen and bring transparency to agriculture and food. My current product is a B2B marketplace for tea farmers. The developer I have been working with since 2013 was the first person to fully explain the beauty of Bitcoin to me.
He convinced me to become one of the first merchants to accept Bitcoin. We had a lot of fun introducing our business model and product to the Bitcoin community. Seriously, you guys saved my business from going under. I am eternally grateful to the Bitcoin community.
It was during this same time that I got my dog, the Beahuahua you see in the photo. The name that came naturally for him was Bitcoin. Most of my friends laughed at it, and strangers always had a hard time understanding what his name was.
Ultimately, my lovable little dog became a powerful education cool for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. People would say "Bitcoin, I heard the CEO is corrupt." It was the perfect opportunity for me to explain to them what Bitcoin really is and why I loved it so much to name my dog after it.
Bitcoin is loving life these days. Everyone knows his name and says "Wow, what a wonderful name".
You all must be loving life too.
My company continues to accept Bitcoin as payment. In fact, to celebrate the recent growth, we have decided to give all BTC orders 25% discount.
Perfect for the holidays, [you can purchase tea tin box sets here]( We have discounted the boxes 30% off and you will see an additional 25% off at check out. If you want a single box just select the Two-Month subscription. Multiple boxes will be shipped in the other subscription sets.
You are welcome to reach out to me directly to customize your box with the teas you want (green, black, oolong, puerh, or white). You can also choose to have multiple boxes shipped to one address to get an additional discount on shipping. Please email info with these inquiries.
Bulk and wholesale are available if you inquire.

This story is about the work that [my company]( is doing in India with independent tea growers. I had no idea that our work was being talk about by the government. 
To be clear, we have yet to send bitcoin to India for tea. We have just started to build the infrastructure necessary to do it. With the ban on exchanges we have decided to take a more conservative approach and work with services like bips.me to wire funds in INR that have been converted from Bitcoin.
I strongly believe in Bitcoin and will do everything I can to advocate for it. Being an entrepreneur using Bitcoin can be stressful though, especially in the international arena, because its so risky and everything happens so fast.

Sure, I'll explain how it went down. We recently partnered with [this company]( to put Litecoin keychains in our a promotion box for the launch of our Litecoin payment processor. A portion of the sales are going to sponsor the Litecoin Development Project. We purchased a batch of keychains with a total cost of $200 +shipping. Instead of paying with USD via Paypal or credit card I sent a BTC payment via Coinbase to an address of the company. The transaction was done through email, but the vendor is currently producing a confirmed paid invoice for me, and I will post it here.

My [farm-direct tea company]( is happily participating in BBB. In addition to a 30% discount we are offering all customers, bitcoin users will be given an additional 10% at checkout for all teas in our [retail catalog](
My company holds onto bitcoins to be used to pay our employees, invoices, and make more affordable international payments to the tea farmers in our network. We love bitcoin!

Good to see you on board. The bitcoin world loves tea and the tea industry (tea farming and production) is the most poised to benefit from bitcoin and other cryptocurrency. 
I'm going to Taiwan next month, we should try to meet up to talk about the future of bitcoin and tea. I run an online farmers market for tea from around the world and we are working to put our complete operations (accepting payment and paying farmers) on bitcoin

[My company]( began accepting btc in Sep. 13 and at first we automatically converted to USD, but now we are holding onto the btc and using it to pay invoices from our vendors. 
We are an online marketplace for tea, we work directly with small tea growers and help them sell their product directly to consumers. Bitcoin is working miracles for us as the average fee we pay to move funds to these farms in India, China, Japan, etc. is 10%.
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:01:39
Yes, I look forward to hearing these stories. I think it's important for it to be told, because it makes it such an easy sale for other merchants to jump on board when they see other merchant success stories.

Thank you Rajiv (for coming forward here. The comment below from is supposedly coming from you. I would like you to come forward to speak on your experience with Tealet.

There are now way more than 3 international tea shops taking bitcoin. As far as I could research [my company]( was the third, but now dozens have joined and many of the owners of these businesses are seeing great success.
My tea company recently shifted gears to focus on wholesale distribution from grower to buyer. One of our newest customers is buying their wholesale tea with bitcoin that they received in their shop. We are now sending the bitcoin as payment to the growers we represent. The first grower to accept is from Nepal. The grower is converting to fiat, but who knows what will be happening in the time to come.
@_date: 2014-05-17 14:50:09
This is not the first time we have received this request. If you know what you want to get please email info and we will create an address for to send btc and we will collect shipping info. From the website you will need to create an account, but if you are clever you don't have to make a "real account". Many people do this and we don't mind, we are not aggressive about email marketing. We figure if you like the tea you will be back for more.

The 60 gram packaging is a tasting and educational experience while the bulk section is just about the tea. The bulk section is open to all, please go ahead and order there for the more competitive pricing. You will receive a very large bag of tea (usually 1 pound) with no frills, just tea. The 60 gram taster boxes come in nice reusable tins with trading cards of each grower containing information about the tea. We are working to make more sizes available (such as 50 grams), but for each new operation we add to the packing the fixed costs go up, so we have to hit a certain scale until we can graduate. We have tested various sizes and tea lovers have liked the 15 gram option the most in the tins. Price is higher, but they are paying for the whole experience. Most of our customers say it makes for a great gift.
These are high quality teas. I won't tell you it's the finest quality and highest quality, we let the cup speak for itself. Also, it is not a fairtrade premium, none of these teas are certified fairtrade. You can learn about what we have learned about fairtrade [here]( The premium is for quality and logistics of bringing these kinds of tea to you. The only way you will find this level of diversity and quality is if you were to travel yourself to procure these teas, so I think we are actually saving you quite a bit of money. At the same time though, we want to make them more accessible and are working to bring down costs and find as many efficiencies as possible, hence our interest in Bitcoin. Not only will be able to secure more profits for the growers, but we can share the savings with the buyer. It's mutually beneficial.
Good tea is pricey, even if you travel yourself and buy it from the farmer. Low priced tea is easy to find, but quality is not the same. These teas are processed by machines and made with low wages, leaving farm workers unmotivated to focus on quality. The wage paid to tea farm workers in India is 90 INR per day (about $150/day), this includes Darjeeling and Assam. Most of the teas provided by our grower network is hand-plucked and hand-processed in small batches and the workers are paid at least 30% more than commercial plantations. Machine processed teas are competition grade and made by tea masters. 
We believe in ethics through quality.

As a woman in the Bitcoin community I know how hard it can be. As a [Bitcoin merchant]( I have been going to Bitcoin conferences and hanging out with leaders in the space (mostly men). I have experienced nothing but respect from them and have never received a surprising response from any of them that a woman was successful at navigating a Bitcoin business (and even tech business). I am a non-tech, non-engineer founder and I have never once felt that my gender or lack of tech has inhibited me, only I have inhibited myself. If some douche touched me inappropriately or talked to me with disrespect I wouldn't generalize the Bitcoin community and say all men in the space would act the same way. I've been treated with much more disrespect in other places, particularly when I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Africa and the Caribbean. As women we must follow through with our dreams with confidence, the men won't even notice, they will only respect!
@_date: 2014-07-26 01:48:05
Thanks for the heads up. We will check it out. Definitely learned a lot from this situation. 
I just have to go off trust that it is not our dev. Would have it really been worth 1 bitcoin for him to become "that guy that posted his company's passwords to the internet"? He's really ashamed, doubt he did it. It was an honest mistake.
@_date: 2014-05-17 06:19:02
Yes this is the issue. All the growers have smart phones and very slow connections to the internet through them. We presented the idea of them becoming local bitcoin ATMs for their communities, but that is taking it too far. The idea is somewhat appealing to then, but they still don't fully understand the logistics.

I wouldn't get too excited, they are probably just testing the waters. I just saw Patrick Collison (CEO of Stripe) speak at a conference about international expansion and he explained Stripe's strategy to utilize landing pages with signups to gauge demand in various markets around the world. This looks just like what he talked about. With this in mind though, we should all sign up and get others to sign up so they see that there is demand and it will be wise for them to do it. [I'm a bitcoin merchant]( of Stripe and I would use it!
Edit: I would also like to add that immediately after his talk at the conference there was a panel on Bitcoin, perhaps that panel and the excitement around it got him thinking...

The teas come from all over the world. We have no limits of who and what teas we work with other than the teas much be connected to a single origin and must be derived from Camellia sinensis. We typically work with independent family-run farms in Japan, China, Taiwan, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, US, and Indonesia. Recently we have started to talking to larger producers such as cooperatives.
@_date: 2014-05-17 04:29:40
Ways to get the BTC to their local currency, such as trusting exchanges. Do you have any idea how we can access a good network of exchanges. Places like China and India will be hard because the government is not supportive of Bitcoin and we don't want to put the growers into legal harm by sending BTC to their country.

We do not have matcha tea available for retail, but have just started working with a tea grower in Shizuoka that is producing and refining their own matcha tea. For the longest time we had trouble finding direct trade matcha. Matcha is typically produced as tencha at the farm but then the matcha is refined in a factory as an aggregation of hundreds if not thousands of growers' tea. Our mission is to provide as much transparency to how the tea is grown, made, and traded. 
Of all places for me to meet this tea growers was Burning Man 2015. We are happy to be working with direct trade matcha. I will be visiting farm and factory in May so we can fully tell their story through video and photos.

Aloha Bitcoin Community,
My online tea farmers market began [accepting BTC]( in September 2013 and surprisingly it became a significant part of our growth. We were so happy with the ease of Bitcoin and its potential that we became advocates and have since introduced bitcoin payments to many other tea retailers, retailers that you have supported with your purchases, thank you. You can become an advocate too by purchasing a [Bitcoin Tea Box]( with BTC which includes 4 teas and a Bitcoin keychain.
Instead of converting all BTC to USD immediately we started looking for opportunities to utilize BTC in our business to make things even more efficient. Now we are paying our developer in BTC, will soon pay a portion of all employees paychecks in BTC, and even paid our first invoice with BTC! Where I see the most potential is in paying the growers with BTC to reduce foreign exchange and payment processing fees (growers in our network currently pay on average 10% fees with Paypal).
Our company works like this: I have personally developed relationships with independent tea growers through my work in international development. During this work I noticed many disadvantages for these tea growers to get their tea to the consumer (middlemen absorb 85% of the profit). I started Tealet as a platform for marketing the tea growers and their teas through storytelling [(check out our videos)]( and involve only one efficient, tech-driven middleman to get the tea to the consumer. The majority of the profits (60-80%) now go to the grower so they can build more infrastructure to improve their quality and keep the art and culture of tea growing alive.
We currently use Paypal, bank wire, or Western Union to send funds to the growers in which either we or the grower pays about 10% fees. With Bitcoin I could only imagine how much more efficient our model could become, so I have slowly started to educate the growers about Bitcoin. I am currently on the tail end of a two month long trip to visit all the growers in person, collect marketing collateral, and introduce Bitcoin.  We have visited Sri Lanka, India, Nepal, China, Taiwan, Japan, and Indonesia. Here is what I've learned:
- Most growers have heard of Bitcoin from their local news (news has been oversensationalized and growers do not have a clear idea of what Bitcoin is)
- With a simple explanation all tea growers are happy to learn more and see how Bitcoin can benefit their business (growers changed their perception of Bitcoin after we gave them a brief education)
- Three growers said they are ready to accept Bitcoin today if we were able to help them convert it to their local currency immediately for less than 3% fees (these growers are located in India, Nepal, and Indonesia)
- One grower is interested in receiving the Bitcoin and holding onto some of it (go Indonesia!)
This is a call for help for advice and recommendations of how we can securely use Bitcoin to pay these growers. I have set up accounts for the three willing growers on Bips.me, but haven't executed a transaction yet, anyone have experience or know any other services? Please leave your comments below or DM me. 
If you like what we are doing and want to support these growers please consider trying out some of their tea with BTC. You can receive [30% off our subscription plans using BTC]( and right now we have a special [Bitcoin Tea Box 33% off]( that includes 4 different teas and a Bitcoin keychain you can use to show your support for the cryptocurrency we love so much.

Thank you for putting BBF together. In 2013 my company was just being introduced to the Bitcoin world. We were happy with the performance of our sales due to your campaign, but most importantly it was the first step that got us fully involved with the community. See why my company decided to support bitcoin [here](
Now we have gone on to create many friends in the community and have even closed some investment in btc and are on the cutting edge of using tools to make payment to the sellers in our marketplace (tea farmers in rural parts of the world) more efficient. Paypal is the most convenient solution, but average charges for the service and currency exchange are 12%. THANK YOU BITCOIN, can't wait to see the full potential of bitcoin and the blockchain to make commerce and life more transparent and fair around the world.
We look forward to participating in the BFF campaign again this year. As always we offer a 3% default discount for saving us from credit card fees but will also have some very special deals for the bitcoin world on that day!

I got into this work with tea growers years ago thinking that we were going to make good and conscious tea more accessible to everyone at a competitive price. What I have learned over the years is that when tea is single origin it has a very high quality and demands a high price in the market. A good comparison is wine. If people want a $5 bottle of wine they can easily find it, but they can just as easily choose to buy a $200 bottle. Price is based on the quality of wine which is associated with the vineyard and terroir. Single origin tea has been very hard to find in the market, we are one of the first to exclusively deal with this kind of tea. If you want good quality and a connection to origin you can buy our tea, many others have made that decision.
@_date: 2013-11-06 08:58:56
Good luck with your launch! I hope it brings you new business. When we launched Bitcoin payment on [my website]( it opened us to a wide audience looking for conscious products.

It's silly that not all businesses are using bitcoin in one form or another.

Thanks for posting the link, that is the correct one. We just started with Bitcoin payment but it gained attention of our tea grower partners, especially in India. We are just in the process of finding a local exchange the farmers can use to exchange their Bitcoin to rupee. Does anyone have any suggestions? 
@_date: 2013-11-16 15:27:19
This group of growers is the first for us to work with in Assam. It is true that Assam teas can be found at affordable prices, but those are industrially made teas (CTC) which are of a lower quality. We brought Heritage tea onto our network because they are focused on orthodox tea production. And although their teas are not hand crafted they are bringing higher quality tea to the market.

Thanks for the advice, we will look into it. I really hope we can set it up quickly. I have been having much trouble with wiring funds to India. I've heard that the government is making it harder and harder.

I believe that they were referring to the globalized distribution system that traditionally has been the only way they could sell their tea. It's an aggregating system with many middlemen that take their cuts, leaving the grower in a difficult position.

This launch has excited some of our growers and it looks like it may not be too far out of the question for us to start doing business with the growers with Bitcoin. I would really like to experiment with a bartering system as well.

Yes customs. Tea usually doesn't have a problem because it is exempt, but randomly a package will get held up. Another big issue is that these farmers pack the tea in their packaging with their local language. Many of our customers were confused when they got their tea and there is only Japanese.

For the sake of transparency [here is the email]( that was sent to me from the grower whose name is Ishan. We have been having issues figuring out how I can best pay him as we sell his tea and I introduced the idea of bitcoin, this was the following email.

Have you seen our [bulk tea program]( It's all about the tea, no fancy packaging. Prices are very reasonable, but you must purchase at least 1 pound.
@_date: 2013-11-16 15:30:43
We deal with all the customs and import of teas in the US so we can fulfill orders faster. You are right that our wholesale prices are WAY lower, but minimum order size is 1 pound. This program is all about the tea, in our retail program it's more about the story and experience. Packaging is different but the tea is the same. We made the wholesale program available to consumers because we understand that there are many tea lovers that really just want the tea.

That is great to hear!

It's so cool that you have taken this leap into Bitcoin. I think it is smart. We have never accepted Paypal at my ecommerce company and just recently started [accepting Bitcoin]( 3 months ago. Our Bitcoin sales far exceed credit card transactions and it's got me thinking that it may be a good idea to go 100% Bitcoin. We are even working now to get our vendors accepting Bitcoin so perhaps one day very soon our entire business will be on Bitcoin!

Good question. We actually don't use the Fairtrade certification for our growers, we use transparency. To learn a little about the true situation of Fairtrade you should check out [this video]( which is about coffee, but the same can be applied to tea. 
The way you know that our farmers are getting a fair share is that they get 60% of the money that you pay for the tea. We add a 40% margin to help with our business. The way we do this is that we pay the asking the price from the grower. We can be assured that the wholesale price that we pay to the grower is going to the people that work on the farm because we work only with independent growers, not large estates or factories. Most of the companies we promote are 4-20 people large (including part-time and full-time laborers), and we are paying a premium price for the product. With this price comes great care in the processing of the tea, which yields an extremely high quality product.

We aren't paying in Bitcoin yet because we haven't found a local exchange where they can get rupee. I think it's only a matter of time!

Aloha, thanks for your comment. I am very familiar with NMteaco, I'm actually friends with owner David from common connections we have in Japan. The products we are offering are quite different. We have dedicated our business 100% to farm-direct teas, which does put us at a disadvantage as we have to import all the teas ourselves and pay higher costs because no one is aggregating the tea for us. In addition we offer richer stories and media around the tea and its producer. We are launching a bulk tea program in the coming month that I think will be more down your alley if you want to get the most tea for your Bitcoin. In this model we will sell tea in at least 1 pound parcels at prices that are the same or lower than the price you can get directly from the grower. We will not be charging a premium because we will not be including the premium packaging or media, just the tea, in some cases drop shipped from the farm. Keep an eye out and [sign up for our bulk tea mail list]( to stay updated of its launch.

Because of importation issues and packaging standards all the tea is shipped to the US first  where we store it and fulfill orders in a timely matter. We started ye business by drop shipping orders directly from the farm, but there way too many issues.

Full transparency is what we ask of the growers that sell tea on our platform. It is true that we can work with larger organizations (most are cooperatives) as long as they disclose what their workers are making and the social programs they are providing. 
To get off the ground it was much faster for us to start promoting farmers that own their own gardens and process their own tea because the transparency piece is easier. I am in conversations with many estates and cooperatives in India and Sri Lanka that we look forward to bringing onto the network. They are focusing on making better quality tea so they can get a better price for it so they can run a better business.
I hope you get to experience our growers' tea and share the stories with others. As long as we have passion and community I think anything is possible.
My personal passion for this enterprise is to inspire positive change in the way we build business and consume. As a food scientist turned Peace Corps volunteer I am on a personal mission to improve our world's food systems. My most recent work has introduced me to tea growers in rural areas that are capable of doing consumer-direct distribution so my focus right now is to build a platform for these growers. If proven successful this platform can be applied to other industries such as cacao, honey, spices, coffee, and other commodities.

You are right that cutting out the middleman does reduce the markup that is usually taken by each broker, distributor, and retailer in the chain. Direct distribution does add some additional costs mostly in regards to shipping. The quality is much higher and the final point is that we pay the right price for the tea to the growers.  The tea you are referring to in your prices is distributed as a commodity,  so unfortunately the only people making a profit are the brokers and retailers, the farmers get negotiated down and the only way to make a decent living is to focus on scale and not quality. We are trying to change that.

We do have white teas, but they are highly seasonal and don't have a long shelf life. Look back at our page in the Spring and we should have all the fresh 2014 white teas.
@_date: 2013-11-16 18:08:15
Our Global Tea Taster subscription provides 4 new samples of tea every other month. Curation is seasonal and an educational experience as we will often highlight two teas from the same farm harvested in different seasons so you can learn the nuances. [You can get 30% off when you subscribe with Bitcoin](

Although the logistics of moving tea around the world are complex we have been able to streamline it with one company with only two employees. The old system of doing things is no longer necessary when we have the power of the internet. If we want people to continue growing and making tea for us we need to pay them more. Younger generations of tea farming families are leaving the country to get better jobs. Average age of a tea farmer in Japan is 64 years old, and the only young people growing tea are using the internet to sell it direct so they can make a proper living.

Aloha, I am Elyse the Founder of Tealet. We are excited to be accepting Bitcoin and look forward to learning the benefits the decentralized currency can have for the international business of tea! Please PM me to let me know if you have any questions.
