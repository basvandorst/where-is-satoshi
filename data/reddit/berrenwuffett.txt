It's more 45% Bitcoin, 45% Ethereum and 10% alts. The alts for fun and Ethereum is one of the few good projects around imo.

I used to be 95% Bitcoin and 5% ETH in 2015. I don't like selling too much at once so ETH naturally always has been a huge part of my portfolio since then.
To answer your original question: Entire investment portfolio sounds awful. I'm more 10% realestate 60% Stocks, 30% crypto. 100 % allocated towards crypto and then even centralized into one coin is an awful investment strategy, its actually more a risky bet.

Just a very small amount. My altcoin portfolio basically consist of a shortlist of coins that meet some minimum standard marketcap weighted. The main reason would be so I don't have to stay up to date on all coins and won't completly miss out if one coin solves a problem in a unique way. So I own a little bit stellar, monero, iota, tether, tron..) 
Kidding no tether or tron of course ;)

Preaching to the choir, but I'm a bit amused by the dissapointment that cryptocurrencies seem to correlate with the stock market.
There are so many alts that are managed like companies, with a business model like companies, do marketing like companies, and suprisingly.. have investors who invest like in companies. 
Of course much of the price rise in Bitcoin can be contributed to institutional investors who will behave like institutional investors, but I'm certain that during a real stock crash Bitcoin will be impacted so much less than token that basically are stocks without regulation.

I was referring to the post in the other subreddits.

Biggest pet peeve: Crypto as a short for cryptocurrencies.

It's because we call the currency Ethereum and not Weium.

People who have millions don't have much fiat. Maybe they even have a bunch of debt so they might would profit from fiat becoming worthless.

The argument that it's 4 cent is just correcting the claim that a transaction costs 50 cent. And I think you are right. 4 cent is absurdly expensive, that's why Ethereum will implement Raiden and PoS.
