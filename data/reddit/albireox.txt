Clearly the solution isn’t working.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:38:26
Increasing block size would fix problems right now, and we need to increase block size in LN, therefore we should increase block size now.
It seems pretty reasonable. Not sure what is wrong with this logic.

enjoy the ride and HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:36:43
Because LN needs the increase anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:16:12
You lost the argument. Don't resort to ad hominem. Bitcoin should have had a block size increase if lightning requires it, as it would have gotten rid of a lot of the current problems temporarily until Lightning is launched.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:30:08
But this is such a great counterpoint. The best thing you could do is explain why this block size increase can't happen now.
I for one didn't even know that lightning would require a block size increase. All I know is that locking up BTC in a state channel still requires a costly transaction.
Many people learn through questions and answers from people that have a counterargument, I.e. the Socratic method. This question doesn't have a very obvious answer even if you did a lot of reading.
If the answer is so obvious to you, answer this question so all the other lurkers on Reddit can continue reading this thread to believe in Bitcoin. Maybe you can stop the FUD.

It's about sending a message.

Sent you 0.001 btc. have fun

Seems like overkill, wouldn't a VM work just as well?

You're assuming that old people will use Bitcoin. The only Bitcoin users I know are under 30.
@_date: 2014-07-02 12:53:41
Unless you subscribe to buildapcsales and realized that they go for $40 less pretty often
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:16:55
Welcome to the rollercoaster that is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-09 12:23:51
Welcome to Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:09:02
@_date: 2014-08-04 19:54:08
This is too complicated
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:03:57
Don't commit suicide like Gox did.

How do you define narrow money? Recall that Satoshi himself has ~1B bitcoins, and there are probably many other irretrievable bitcoin stashes in the world.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:39:30
Meanwhile BTC tx fees are ~$5-$10 lmao
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:59:11
You still need high fees to get your money
@_date: 2017-09-20 15:30:12
Throwback to magical internet money

Placing a GDAX limit order has a 0% fee.
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:48:03
The US is currently trying to increase inflation...
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:42:36
You should just set an alarm to buy on GDAX every so often. That's what I do. 0 fees.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:02:35
do it pls
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:01:41
More like investing actually
@_date: 2013-12-08 10:48:32
Well, if you're making money, you *do* know.
@_date: 2013-10-31 20:26:31
Bitcoin is so easy to accept. I don't understand why they don't accept it.
@_date: 2013-12-16 13:38:47
About 20%, though back when I got them they were about 2% of my wealth
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:46:02
Nice, but the resolution on some of them sucks.
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:39:29
ITT: OP mad about losing tons of money
@_date: 2013-12-09 07:36:42
Yes. That's what I do.
