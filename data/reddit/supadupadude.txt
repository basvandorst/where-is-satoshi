Is it the facial verification? Because you're gonna need to use a computer with a camera or you can use your cellphone to finish that.

You can trade from coinbase because the transactions happen instantly, but they come at a higher fee. The cheaper way would be to transfer your bought bitcoin to gdax and trade from there because their fees are very small or non existent if you trade a certain way, but its a more advanced trading platform than coinbase. 
The money you have in your coinbase wallet stays there until you withdraw it back to you're bank account. If you have a debit card, you can deposit/withdraw from there instantly rather than waiting a couple days for the transaction to go through.
