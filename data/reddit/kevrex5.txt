I don't get why people bash other peoples decisions. You are free to do what you want with your money. Period. 
Now in light of the "crazy" bitcoin crash this guy lost tons of money right?
No.. he bought at $14-$25.. current price.. $200.. He's still doing alright.

Localbitcoins.com or Can meet them tonight with cash if you find a seller. I've done a trade through them and it went smoothly. Just make sure you don't give them your cash/check before you have the verification code.

Hm. So if I do multiple transaction in one transaction it would be less of a fee, right?
If so thanks for the answer.

Bitcoin difficulty depends on the total computational power that is present on the network. The difficulty stays the same for about a week (2016 blocks) and is recalculated for each block. The mining difficulty doesn't really affect the BTC price.

Actually look what someone just posted.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:43:37
That's what people said about email addresses when they first came out, yet here we are.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:12:47
That's exactly what I did. There's a good article posted on the BFL site, sec...
Outlines a few different scenarios for miners.

Seems legit IMO. They accept Paypal, they process refunds, and now they maybe (pray to god) might be shipping in the next few weeks.
On the other hand.. I know what you mean.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:53:47
I personally am comfortable with the amount of $$ I put into Bitcoin, so I am alright with the high exchange differences. Although I gotta say I find it funny that people are mass selling at $130, and less then an hour later it's back up to $220. You feel stupid?
@_date: 2013-05-03 10:26:59
Awesome. Gotta love math.

Register on Mtgox, get your account verified and sell in chunks of 20 at the current market price.
Also BTC seems to have recovered, selling at $191 last I checked.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:07:34
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:33:00
There was so much math in that sentence it may just work.
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:36:20
It's because on BTC-E when changing any security settings your withdraw is disabled for three days to reduce scamming and fraud. You probably enabled 2fa which caused this 3 day suspension.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:29:07
Sold mine at 255 yesterday, stuck at work until later tonight. That's the way she goes.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:15:47
Same plan as it was yesterday, and the day before.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:49:21
Cool! Thanks man :)
Any more questions you got PM em my way.

$100,000.00 for each bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:27:10
reserve would have to be in one location?
lets centralize a reserve with fiat money
great idea

Not with one backend server. They need to make a distributed system that can't be affected by a "DDoS" attack, and that can handle HUGE surges in trading traffic.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:14:41
If you have your wallet installed already go to the tab that says Receive Payment. There will be an address.. something like "a8d76f5a783hj43f87asd8asdf70", that is your address. From the MTGox site send it to that address.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:19:00
BTC value showed resilience. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:13:07
10 BTC in for $112.
Sold 4 for 255.
Holding the rest till... whenever. I am out nothing, but still believe in BTC. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:49:52
Same think'n kinda train.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:01:20
Localbitcoin, mtgox, cavirtex, 
Gotta jump through the hoops in order to actually use the site tho.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:13:38
Totally new to me too. I actually have no idea how to check if I got that.. or what.
@_date: 2013-04-28 10:32:40
I was expecting BTC to be at the bottom. I was disappointed. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:12:10
It did. You are sane.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:00:14
I upvoted him. Seems too legit to not be legit.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:53:26
Maybe think of a ASIC device if you want to get into mining.

Facebook chat and email have two very different applications. 
Also I'm pretty sure Facebook has email enabled on all accounts, so you can, like send emails and stuff.

0.01 BTC is 10,000,000 satoshis
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:58:27
Because that would be smart and professional.
Neither of which are capable at Mtsux.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:30:39
I don't understand how a server could be on an intranet but be connected via VPN. Doesn't this kind of make it pointless to put in into an intranet?
Also 5 coin minimum is HUGE. 
And lets say MTGOX just setup a distributed system that can load balance properly.. and be able to utilize multiple concurrent server instances. That would be win.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:29:01
When enough stores start to accept BTC. 
When I get paid in BTC.
Then I will more freely spend my BTC.
Because BTC is the future.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:51:58
Oh, I see. Well I've heard that you can sometimes with at Satoshidice, but I'm not a gambler (yet here I am with BTC :P). 
Try and buy 0.1 for $$, and try and sell for high, buy for low. See what that gets ya
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:03:32
I have a pre-order with Butterflylabs for one of the 25 M/hs units. Keep in mind that they have never shipped a unit. You could go with Avalon, but that sets you back (I think it's 20 BTC, can someone confirm) a lot.
EDIT: Also these ASIC devices just plug in through USB, so you just need a "controller" PC.
@_date: 2013-04-15 01:24:06
The problem is it won't let me send the transaction without paying the higher fee.
@_date: 2013-05-02 23:17:34
I think it's a risky bet... but...
you paid...
31,000 for a June pre-order? You could have bought 2 Avalon 60G/h for that price..
Anyways.. goodluck.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:48:50
I don't think it's even worth it for you. 
Mining with a CPU can get you like.. 4 M/hs.. which is like 0.00001 BTC a day.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:41:39
How much?
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:47:37
I understand. Yet everyone seems to think this is a major crash. I lol at them. Sell your coins cheap! Let me buy them! haha
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:08:50
Buy now.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:32:19
Price will jump.
Price will fall.
I'm certain of either 1 of these options will happen.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:46:03
How do you start what? Setting up an account? Setting up a miner?
Be more specific please.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:10:13
Different addresses. Your BTC were just sent to whoever has that address in the BTC world.
EDIT: So wrong haha. Sorry, was an uninformed answer.
