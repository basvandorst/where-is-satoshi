And that doesn't even take into account the power consumption required for running the systems that handle digital transfers, security, and basic bookkeeping.  You know, the things that the Bitcoin miners are doing...

I would assume that the mods would make an exception for a cause such as this.  Charity cases seem to be exempt from that rules (think about the Dorian Nakamoto donation drive).

Semantics.  XRP and Ripple are one and the same.  XRP is the currency created as part of the Ripple system, and thus the two are linked.
And yes, speculators are investors in this case, as it is very difficult to differentiate between those that bought into the system as an investment, and those that were only speculating for short term gains.  
When a company experiences this type of turmoil, it can cause previously confident investors to rethink their position and liquidate their holdings.  That doesn't make them speculators.

I agree!  It is very exciting.  I actually considered attending MIT at one point, and sometimes wish I had (though, I know many things that I cherish in my life...such as my son...would not exist had I made that decision, so I do not regret my decision to not).
MIT continually amazes me, and is one of the bright, shining examples of an institution with true exceptionalism, forward thinking, and the ability to cause positive change in the world.

That is not Occam's Razor.  The hypothesis with the FEWEST assumptions is the most likely...not the one with the MOST assumptions.

I thought about it, but it seemed like it has been used everywhere.  I may add it in a moment.

By "Directly Through Facebook" I was referring to the fact that it can be sent seamlessly while on Facebook, without the need to ask them to download a wallet, send you an address, etc.
