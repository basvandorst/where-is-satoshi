Are we taking bets on when it will hit this number?
I'm gonna say Saint Patrick's Day. That's actually pretty conservative if it continues to speed up the way it has been going this past month or so.

Coinbase passed 19k... very briefly.

I doubled my (admittedly very small) investment in Bitcoin today. Bought when it was 11,839.
I'm still scared. Not being very productive at work today.

I never said I hate it. It just seems like a weird thing to name an arena after.
I know there's many arenas, stadiums, and ballparks named after banks. That's different in my mind because those are companies paying for a sponsorship. Where as bitcoin is supposed to be a currency.
I don't hate it.

Exactly what I was thinking. No other currencies have a stadium named after them...
Welcome to the US Dollar Arena!
The Peso Pavillion
The British Pound Ballpark
The Franc Field
**edit**: Yes I know many arenas are named after banks. Banks ≠ Currencies.

Sooo, is ripple coming to coinbase too?
Cause I converted all my Bcash into XRP like 2 days ago and thought I had totally missed the boat when Bcash took off after the coinbase announcement.
