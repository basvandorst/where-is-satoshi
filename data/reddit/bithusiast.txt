Alright, let's say the thief just transferred 650k coins to some wallet and it's just been sitting there. First off if Mt. Gox does not co-operate, how do we know which address that is? How do we know which Mt. Gox addresses got emptied? 
Then if you reverse the transaction so that those addresses are no longer emptied, the hacker still has access to the private key so he can re-empty them. Any reversal would have to be either into an Mt. Gox account that they actually fully and solely control, or directly to Mt. Gox users. To determine who owns what, Mt. Gox co-operation would be required once again. If Mt. Gox is uncooperative or we don't want to trust them, the whole thing is almost unfeasible. 
For example, Dogecoin users got their own Goxxing through an online wallet called Dogewallet, and even though funds were raised to reimburse them a long time ago, it still has not happened because of the difficulty of determining who has a valid claim to those funds.

This would set a bad precedent which centralizes power over who owns what. Besides, if the coins have been used to trade with honest people (like selling stuff to whoever stole those coins, without knowing they were stolen coins), the reversals of transactions involving Gox coins would affect honest people.

Did he send you this? 
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:18:14
No, it's 2-of-2, you hold one and they hold one. But if they change the code on their site they can easily make it so your private key is revealed to them, in which case they will control both. This risk is the same even if it was 2-of-3. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 17:09:50
Cool, I'd like to read about that.
@_date: 2014-04-05 15:25:48
Could you elaborate on what re-depositing means? I'm still kind of confused by it.

This makes it easier through the magic of HD wallets though, since you only need to write down your mnemonic passphrase once, rather than backing it up all the time. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 14:03:35
This is probably the way to go when Bitcoin rewards reach near-zero in order to secure the network. Or would you rather it be implemented right now? 
@_date: 2014-04-06 20:13:12
I found this: 
It's been just over a year, but hey at least it's in the pipeline. It looks like multi-sig and HD wallets are coming really soon now in Armory, looking at Etotheipi's latest posts. Man, that guy is pretty cool.

A planned hard fork where there are like 5000 blocks before the changes are implemented could give people the buffer they need to upgrade, after that if you lose money it's your own fault for not upgrading.

True, but then they store one part of the 2-of-2 address. Their solution, which is those nLockTime transactions, seems a bit unwieldy to me. The method I describe above basically does what greenaddress.it does, but leaves both private keys in your hands. 
The only security trade-off for not having to deal with re-deposits and nLockTime transactions is that you have to write down an additional mnemonic passphrase, and if you keep it together with your other mnemonic passphrase, an offline thief could steal both of them at once. Using greenaddress, you would have to have your single mnemonic passphrase stolen and the attacker would have to have malware on your 2FA device in order to steal your funds, which I guess is a bit safer, but I don't know whether that's worth all the messing around with the nLockTime transactions.
Not a knock on greenaddress.it by the way, they are awesome and a giant leap in security with their multi-sig implementation, and they also have their greenaddress instant confirmation service which could prove very valuable. But I would personally prefer having full control and responsibility over all my private keys, without unwieldy workarounds like nLockTime transactions.
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:40:32


I meant, you can change the website so that when you log in with your mnemonic it sends the mnemonic (which is basically your private key) to you guys, am I wrong? I'm not sure what malleability has to do with this.


I did not know you could disable auto-updates that way, I'll update the OP to reflect that. And yes, on Android it is dead easy, that's why I didn't really feel I needed to tell people how to do that, only that they should. 
It's already better than most online wallets by default because there are "good" (i.e. you are guaranteed to be the only person in control of your private keys) ways to use your service, whereas almost every other online wallet is "bad" by default since they control your private keys. But there are still some "bad" ways to use your service, like relying on the website or using auto-updating client-side apps, and I just want to point people towards the "good" ways of using it. I do expect you guys to make "good" the only way, for example by requiring open source hardware wallets, but it doesn't hurt to be cautious in these early stages.

I am a bitcoin enthusiast simply because Bitcoin represents the open sourcing of electronic payments. This means anyone can innovate and Bitcoin has incredible potential to create new ways in which we spend money, and money movements will no longer need to be enforced by a slow and torturous legal system, but instead by elegant math and cryptography.
An example is the fact that I've had an inheritance stuck in the legal system for 8 years now. In the future, through digital wills, inheritances will simply be resolved by pre-determined cryptographically secure scripts.

AFAIK Scrypt-N basically changes the N-factor every so often, which means ASIC's built for the old N-factor would become useless. I don't know if you can build an ASIC that can mine under all possible N-factors and still have the advantages of an ASIC. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 16:29:25
You could run two PoW schemes in mixed mode before dropping SHA256 entirely. Something like Scrypt-N already has miners built for it. However, difficulty would have to drop dramatically in order to make Scrypt-N mining profitable considering the power-hungry GPU's involved. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:51:26


True, that's why this post is just a recommendation to avoid the website and use the client-side apps instead (with auto-updating off), not to avoid your service altogether. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 23:03:45
Bitcoin-QT devs, armory devs and electrum devs! Actually it could be really cool if you could get Armory or Electrum to integrate your code into their wallets, but I guess they're technically your competitors.

I think these are ideas that can be better implemented outside of the Bitcoin network through service providers and multi-sig. I mean 2FA would basically entail having two different private keys on two different devices, you can already do this by creating a multi-sig address that requires signatures from both private keys, there is really no need for a network change to allow this. 
Re: all the other stuff, I'd say a 2-of-3 multi-sig scheme where you own two keys (one in deep cold storage, and a regular one) and some service provider owns another, it would allow the service provider to do all of those rate-limiting things without you having to trust them with full control of your coins. 
If the end-user can not be trusted to safeguard the keys, a 2-of-2 implementation as used by greenaddress.it could provide these security features.

That's not how probabilities work. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 13:46:05
Care to elaborate? 
@_date: 2014-04-05 19:19:23
I wish I knew how to code so I could write something like this myself, but alas I am a non-coding pleb. Hopefully the Electrum developer who is much more talented than me already thought of something like this or at least how to add multi-sig functionality to Electrum, and we'll be seeing that soon.

Storage capacity is increasing at a rate higher than Moore's law (Kryder's law), if the block size limit is increased gradually it might not be a problem for nodes to have sufficient storage, besides there are all kinds of pruning possibilities to make "lite" nodes. And according to [this]( page the network bandwidth and CPU requirements aren't crazy. 
Or maybe I misunderstood something? 
And regarding anonymity, I meant changing the protocol so everyone is anonymous by default, like Darkcoin is trying to do (I don't know if there actually is a workable way to do this, but this is a hypothetical wishlist :P)
@_date: 2014-04-05 17:32:10
Considering this is a pretty large-scale effort, the hackers would be alerted and would probably dump their coins on an exchange before the reversal could happen. There is no way to coordinate this without alerting the thieves and giving them ample opportunity to circulate their coins.
@_date: 2014-04-05 13:53:47
I think with hardware wallets like Trezor, it will be much harder to steal private keys. Then in the event that they do, assuming Trezor can interface with online wallet providers, your online wallet provider could provide typical banking functions like daily limits (which could be higher for known addresses), or freezing your account in case of suspicious activity. The cool thing is that since your hardware wallet can not leak your private keys to the online wallet provider, there is no way for them to actually take your funds, only preventing activity.
I think lately the only exchange that lost coins from their cold storage is Mt. Gox, CaVirTex, PoloniEx and Flexcoin only lost hot wallet funds right? Mt. Gox probably didn't even get their cold storage funds hacked, they either just lost access because they're incompetent, it was an inside job, or their cold storage wasn't really cold as it could automatically leak funds into their hot wallet.

Are the new P2SH outputs just newer deterministically derived addresses from the same seed (hashed with your part of the 2-of-2)? So you're basically moving your unspent outputs down the list of addresses in an HD wallet? Do you have safeguards in place that place caps on users transactions to external addresses, but not to P2SH addresses that are derived from their seeds (i.e. their re-deposits aren't rate-limited like external transactions)?
Also, what happens if someone gets access to your seed, after the thief maxes out your daily limits or whatever, how do you regain control of your funds, how do you prove to greenaddress.it that you're you and not the thief that stole your seed? 
@_date: 2014-04-05 12:59:49
The obvious one is increasing the block size limit. But how about switching to quantum computer resistant cryptography? Or adding network wide anonymity features? Or even something crazy like copying the ideas behind Ethereum? 
What do you guys think Bitcoin is missing? 
@_date: 2014-04-05 15:56:29
Really? Why? I mean, the storage bottleneck will still be there, but I think as far as CPU and network bottlenecks, there can be a lot more transactions per second than there are today due to the artificial limit. If ultimate blockchain compression is implemented at the same time, does that not "fix" the storage bottleneck too? 
@_date: 2014-04-05 15:30:42
You could theoretically change absolutely everything, but the fork with the new changes needs to be supported by a majority of users, so the changes are limited to the consensus opinion. Recently Dogecoin had a hard fork, and they changed the reward system and the difficulity retargeting system, as far as I know it went relatively well. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 22:30:28
Regarding having someone verify and compile the open source code (or doing it myself), this is a step that I can't really take for various reasons, has anyone (some trustworthy figure in the BTC community) repped your client, looked at the source, or anything? A few third party assurances would really put my mind at ease if I use your client
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:05:06
Oh I know that and I agree, I'm just doing my part in helping people make that informed decision. If they just heard about greenaddress.it and went to the site they might not know of this risk, and that there are alternatives in the form of open source clients :)
@_date: 2014-04-05 19:55:58
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm merely an enthusiast with a fairly barebones understanding of Bitcoin. I just linked you to the relevant wiki entry regardng this discussion, I didn't write it. 
The problem here is that the incentive to obtain transaction fees is decoupled from the network's need for security, as described [here]( Because the increasing value of BTC also means increased incentives to perform attacks, it's a good thing that the increase in the value of BTC also leads to more miners competing for that BTC. This coupling, according to that link at least, gradually disappears when we switch to lower and lower block rewards. What this means is that although there is an incentive to compete for those transaction fees, the resulting hashrate might not be high enough to secure what will then be a trillion-dollar network if Bitcoin becomes incredibly succesful, as you said. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 16:22:32
Sorry for all these noob questions, but what is the benefit of your model compared to a wallet that has a mobile phone and desktop component, with a private key generated on each, that requires using both to sign a hash of the two keys? 
In other words, if my 2FA device is the only thing standing in the way of a thief using my seed to steal all my BTC, why have the second part of the 2-of-2 on your servers instead of directly on my 2FA device? 
@_date: 2014-04-29 14:13:48
Oh wow, you were serious!
Works exactly how I envisioned (just a matter of making it user-friendly now), good job! 
@_date: 2014-04-29 14:25:10
Can the Bitcoin Authenticator also see what the fee is going to be? Or is there a possibility of malicious software infecting your desktop wallet and making the miner's fee a big amount without you being able to catch it by looking at the authenticator screen, assuming your phone is not infected? 
@_date: 2014-04-05 13:07:42
Already exists, no fork required :)
@_date: 2014-04-05 20:28:53
Is there a forum thread I could look at? I'm always interested in learning new things about Bitcoin! 
Can't it just be sent over the internet? I mean I appreciate some people would rather keep their 2FA device 100% offline, but even keeping it online is still more secure than local wallets. Or if sending it over the internet is not possible, I guess animated QR codes could be a sloppy but workable solution. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 18:09:37
Why would the coin loss rate eventually become 1BTC/block? I don't understand how the block rewards and the coin loss rate would find equilibrium with each other. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 16:57:56
Assuming you use HD wallets on both ends, you're fine so long as you write down both of the mnemonics, and since they are generated and kept on separate devices, it should be okay for reasonable end-user security since the user is unlikely to get malware on both their mobile phone and their computer. 
The only additional risk gained from this is the fact that users would probably keep both their mnemonics together, which can lead to an offline attack, but at least the online threat would be greatly minimized. 
I wish I knew how to code, so I could make sort of an HD P2SH wallet which deterministically makes 2-of-2 P2SH addresses out of two seeds. The mobile component could even use the mobile seed as a separate wallet for "walking around" money. I don't think all this is possible with BitGo is it? 
@_date: 2015-01-16 02:46:37
Your security could be beaten by compromising the device you are using. BIP-38 means it's impossible to bruteforce but a keylogger on your device would do the trick. Plus something that also records the code you scanned. Or a compromised wallet application. 
In short, it's not even close to being safe enough for cold storage. You say you can use it on every device you know is safe, but if you're paranoid (which you should be if you have a large amount of Bitcoins) then the devices you consider safe should be extremely limited, and should certainly not extend to your internet connected phone. 
If you just have a small amount of Bitcoins then it's whatever, truthfully the chance that your phone gets compromised is pretty small if you use some common sense w.r.t. the apps you download, and your device isn't rooted or jailbroken. You aren't completely safe though, cause of Evil Maid attacks and such.
@_date: 2015-02-16 09:49:32
Great, so you made your pedantic point that isn't relevant to anything in this thread. 
What exactly was the purpose of your comment anyway? When something is 99.(a trillion nines)% a sure thing, non-autists don't bother calling it "virtually unhackable" and just go with "unhackable" instead, good thing you showed them the error of their ways!
@_date: 2015-02-16 10:06:15
So when you play a video game that tells you you have a 100% chance to succeed at an action, do you call up the game developers and tell them "UGH I'm so tired of people saying 100%, don't you realize a cosmic ray could hit my gaming device and flip a bit so that the action would fail? IT'S PROBABILITIES MAAAAAN DON'T YOU IDIOTS UNDERSTAND"? No? Then why did you feel the need to do basically the same idiotic, pedantic song and dance here?
Besides, if you are playing the odds you might as well try actually mining Bitcoin rather than hacking addresses, even your shitty laptop doing CPU mining technically has a chance to find 7170BTC in about a week, and the funny thing here is that that tiny chance is still bigger than that same shitty laptop brute forcing ANY address in that same week. Or you know, do literally anything else with your computing power or your electricity money (put it all in lotteries!) which would have an expected value orders of magnitude above hacking addresses. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 09:56:29
Because he is being insanely pedantic. The chance of a bruteforce is so infinitesimal it's not worth considering by any reasonable person, so there is zero worth to him bringing it up.
