POW is a way for the coin to not need exchanges or even barter to be acquired, all it takes is for someone to convert some electricity from their home or country, to get hold of the currency and they will have the currency in a kind of fair way since its level of difficulty is equal all over the world. They both have their advantages and weaknesses.

3975 coins per day is 1450875 coins per year. 
At $300 that is $ 43,526,2500 per year. If there are 500,000 new users per year, that is each one spending $72 every months or $2,5 each dau, to get hold of a total of 2,9 coins each.

Price goes down on good news as someone is obviously "manipulating" the price and selling on good news to break confidence in Bitcoin.

That explains the latest price fall. 
Someone hacked Bitstamp, and produced new "Bitcoins" in their database out of thin air. The same thing that happened at Mt.Gox. 
The price fall is not made with real Bitcoins but manipulated numbers at an exchange..

You only lose money if you sell at a loss, if you keep them until you are in black. This involves taking a risk, but if you do not want to take that risk and instead prefer a loss than that is your decision. 
But you are not losing anything, you still have the same amount of coins that you own.

No, that would hurt them economically way more than if it did not happen.
