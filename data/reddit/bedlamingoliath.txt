Looks good, though the site design is a little harsh on the eyes at the moment in wide screen. Perhaps the semi-transparent box can scale to monitor size?

Because the "bubble" was $2 billion dollar valuation on bitcoin.
I'd consider that  pretty small
@_date: 2013-04-20 12:35:12
$1,000,000.00 would make the total value of the bitcoin system:
* $21,000,000,000,000.00
Twenty-one trillion dollars.

You ordered a pre-order. There is no tracking number.
They offer refunds no questions asked.
Fuck people are clowns around here. Why did you order something before actually finding out anything about it?

too many kids on here with no respect for munger or buffet.

True, but, their principles allowed them to call the dot com bust before anyone else, and completely avoid it

This is a great looking exchange I have to say. The others, including Mt Gox look down right amateurish in comparison.
This looks more like my brokerage account, which I'm guessing is what you were going for.

Just an FYI on how these scams work. They're designed to lull in the stupidest or most gullible people they can. The spelling errors and general trouble with the english language - all deliberate. They work on the same system that many other scams work - Mass exposure and saturation, filter out anyone who has an inquisitive or critical mind, and attack those who are gullible. This kind of scam has been going on for many years (previously perpetrated on senior citizens through the mail - YOU'RE A WINNER! Etc).
TL:DR - don't expect a reply. Sorry to be captain bringdown

Look at the network hash rate. Since it hasn't climbed by TH/s. BFL haven't got their ASICs stashed away hashing for themselves.

I've been told this by so many employees it's just so ridiculous. I try to show them the bill on my smart phone but they say nope, has to be on paper. That could be fake.
I say "I'm literally going to print this out and give it to you, you know that right"
"paper only"
...fuck me...
@_date: 2013-04-20 12:38:52
That's just incorrect. Refunds have been freely given.
@_date: 2013-05-03 13:19:30
agreed, but i'm talking about the look and interface
@_date: 2013-06-30 11:30:32
bitcoin noobie?
@_date: 2013-05-08 13:00:54
Kids seem to permeate the bitcoin community, I don't know why, either that or a large portion of the community is extremely childish, which is a shame.

Well, they're expecting to severely reduce power consumption with the new board redesigns.
@_date: 2013-05-03 11:07:28
That was my first though. This could bring in the traditional players as it will be much more familiar to them.
@_date: 2013-11-22 07:51:07
That's good to hear. But remember a lot of these scams are not perpetrated by Nigerians alone. There are scammers in every country.
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:23:46
Honestly, no.
I expect the difficulty to increase by 100x. You might get back your initial investment in 12 months time. But there also might be new ASICs developed in those 12 months.
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:32:28
Indeed, and they have one working here:
@_date: 2013-04-13 07:34:34
I have not had an issue with them. It sounds like a user error and it's just amateur hour in here again.
@_date: 2013-04-02 10:06:36
Well, yeah he asked the question, and then spoke over the guy who was trying to answer him.
@_date: 2013-10-10 09:15:35
Cause that story is totally believable...
