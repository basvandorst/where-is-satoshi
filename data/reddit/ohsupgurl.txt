For Accenture, sad to say degree is required, buttttt you aren't completely out of luck. I have a buddy who's a manager for an IT firm based in Reston that hire's guys without a degree, and another buddy who works help desk out of Tysons that I can shoot your resume over to look at.

Copying and pasting the same response on every thread.. lawl.

But they don't keep any bitcoin.. so how could they?
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:32:58
I'm having a hard time trying to understand the point of this. Basically just seems like you want to raise 100BTC for yourself to become a Ski Instructor.

I really like Coinbase. Every time I've needed to talk to someone on their live chat they have been more than helpful. They just put out their new vault feature too which makes the extra security nice, especially if you plan on holding for a long time.

Not to be rude, but I kind of hate it :-/

I have a paper backup I made. My original Armory is on an Ubuntu netback that doesnt touch the internet, and I made a watch only file that I have sitting on my live pc. It just doesn't to seem to want to register the transaction history anymore since I deleted that databases directory. I checked my address on the blockchain and all my coins are still there so I'm not in panic mode.

It's been around since I started using it a few months back. It just doesn't show up when there isnt anyone online to help you.

I've been doing a lot of research and hopeful things take off again. Could have bought more but my bank account needs a little money in it too :) hah. Only regret is not buying last night when I was looking at it sitting at $350

I think this is pretty common with ACH transfers? Correct me if I'm wrong.

I work as a Database Administrator in Alexandria for Accenture. We have tons of projects around the DC area, so if you have a college degree, shoot me a message and maybe I can help you out. Coinbase support has always been ridiculously helpful for me, so I hope I can return the favor in some way.

Looking at the amount of bitcoin you have in your wallet makes me want to cry for being a late adopter.
Send me $.10 to prove its actually yours.

Forgive me if I understand this wrong, but didn't their firmware update fix the mulit factor issue?
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:31:13
Fuck you, I laughed so loud at work just now.
@_date: 2015-01-23 17:09:03
Man, I can only hope we hit $120. I'll buy a ton. I missed my chance at $160 :(
@_date: 2015-01-30 06:01:44
But Microsoft accepts BTC..
@_date: 2015-01-25 01:21:56
I actually bought 2 at $233 lol
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:32:21
Well, a week ago :)

This was the deal. It probably still isn't around. The first few times I tried it the website told me they reached their limit on coupon redemptions, but I just kept trying the coupon every day and it ended up working. 
EDIT: If you can't get the deal, saying something to customer service and they might bring it back due to popularity. That's what I did the first time the coupon got denied.

I literally just bought an Xbox One, Assassins Creed Unity and Black Flag, and 1 year of Xbox live for only $250 on Newegg BECAUSE I used Bitcoin.  No incentive my ass. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 06:05:40
Unless I read this and understood it wrong, isn't it a thing now?
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:57:11
When it gets denied and Bitcoin plummets, its going to be really bad publicity.
@_date: 2015-07-26 05:57:02
Jorge Stolfe on there being annoying as usual.

The worst sandwich I've ever had in my entire life was made at Jimmy Johns.
@_date: 2015-02-12 20:19:10
Cool story, bruh.
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:52:02
So, when they say 10K BTC.. do they mean they've acquired 10K BTC from their bots, or they expect the price to go to 10K per BTC?
@_date: 2015-02-18 18:24:50
No, I'm pretty sure they had 80-90k coins.
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:09:35
Well, yeah. Look how convienient it was for that short conversation to spell out everything for us. Like the villian in a movie telling our hero their entire plan before he escapes.
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:48:30
I've never had an order cancelled, or anything negative happen to my account. How are they scamming when you're still getting your money back?
@_date: 2015-02-11 23:08:10
Hurry up, Virginia -_-
