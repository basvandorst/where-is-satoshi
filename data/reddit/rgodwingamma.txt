Counterargument to quantum computer argument: they can be used to support Bitcoin's network as well.

Even if they can connect an IP address to a bitcoin address, there still lies a substantial hurdle to prove that the person using the IP address is the person they are prosecuting. In the U.S., this is a pretty difficult hurdle to overcome.

Ah, right. Thanks for clarifying!

Most of the financial industry (with the exception of hedge funds) have mandates to only invest in registered 40 Act products. A bitcoin ETF opens the door for retail investors to get exposure to bitcoin through their investment advisors and brokers.

Price parity != market cap parity. I understand the excitement, but it's also good to keep this in mind. Edit: This also occurred back in 2013.

BTU doesn't want to activate SegWit, because it enables Blockstream to activate sidechains. I imagine this is really the reason SegWit activation is being blocked. Bitmain probably sees Blockstream as a competitor and doesn't want to them to take the industry lead.

The problem is that governments typically use situations like this one to constrict morally-acting, normal citizens' freedoms. It's easy to get the public to give up rights when you can point to a pedophile taking advantage of that same right.

Thanks for your hard work on tumblebit along with Kristov Atlas! Will it be implemented as a sidechain like mimblewimble or will it be a stand alone solution?

Nopara, thanks for commenting and sharing your research! I'm assuming you're the same Nopara recently on YouTube with the Samurai wallet guys, is that correct?

I didn't make the claim that LN will improve privacy and anonymity. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:29:53
You're aware that LN is one of many sidechains, and that LN specifically addresses the issue of higher throughput? I even linked to the confidential transactions website when I discussed privacy and anonymity. So no, I didn't kinda even remotely suggest that LN offers privacy and anonymity. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:21:27
You should probably ask why Nopara is saying that Monero should not be considered completely fungible since he's probably worked on more cryptocurrency anonymity projects than you (just guessing).
Nopara, what makes you say that about Monero?
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:39:28
I actually did not claim once that the "other side" wants to destroy fungibility. I made the claim that the destruction of fungibility is a byproduct of traceability. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:56:47
Doubtful that there will ever be a fundamental change like MW implemented directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. Just my opinion. Too many competing interests over whether anonymity is a good idea.

"Think about all the money in Swiss and Cayman bank accounts, in hidden bars of gold. Think about how much of Wall Street is devoted to creating judgment resistant trusts. Think about how much time, how big of a legal department, even firms like Apple have to structuring their assets in such a way that they're resilient from any particular judge just being able to say, "Freeze their accounts." You have a fundamental demand that's very, very easily 10 trillion dollars globally, that we can see. This isn't speculative. There's more than 10 trillion dollars, right now, allocated in places and in assets and in trusts specifically to be judgment resistant or judgment proof. And it's not just a question of it being illicit."

To add to this, the Chinese gov has a massive incentive to keep transactions on-chain for monitoring purposes. They've likely been subsidizing Bitmain and using them as a means to subvert any attempt to push transactions off-chain. After SegWit was finally implemented, they are rage-quitting and banning bitcoin.

Technically, I actually did buy a house USING Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:59:08
Sure. I had to paint a pathway of a date on which I held the coins in a certain wallet that connected to the present day when I sold the coins into a back account. I sent a bunch of snapshots with little blurbs of explaining what it was I was trying to explain in the pictures. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:53:16
Thanks, this comment is actually reassuring.

See comment thread starting with CryptoEdge's comment.
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:50:53
Sort of both. I had to prove ownership over the coins for a certain time period before they would accept the cash received from liquidating the bitcoin. I'm sure it was to verify that I hadn't obtained the coins through illegal means. The interesting point is that they were prepared for it, and they knew exactly what they needed in order to go forward with the mortgage!

This post wasn't about block size at all. It was about misaligned economic incentives. If you want to talk about scaling, then yes, transaction malleability is a problem. It's hindering the free development of any solutions to the issue of scaling. Instead of "may the best solution win," it is now, "your solution threatens my business model, and I know how to block the implementation of your solution."
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:34:33
AsicBoost inherently is not bad. But the patentability of it is a problem, because it provides an asymmetric comparative advantage that is enforced outside of the bitcoin ecosystem. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:06:44
Also, Satoshi did not contemplate transaction malleability. Which we know now is what is hindering the ability of all parties to contribute to Bitcoin in whatever way they see fit. So we have some parties (Bitmain) blocking the progress of other parties (Blockstream) simply because they can (and for obvious business reasons). 
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:29:08
It hinders the development of sidechains, which limits the possible solutions to scaling. Not saying sidechains is the answer, I'm saying that it hinders the ability of the market to determine which is the safest way to scale. If there were no transaction malleability, there would be equal footing for all scaling solutions on the table right now. 
Edit: I've already answered why I believe transaction malleability is indeed a vulnerability. Hard to say whether or not anyone has lost money as a result of transaction malleability, although it certainly has been blamed. I'm aware that the allegations of that have never been proven or disproven.
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:39:38
This is pretty damn funny 
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:55:07
Satoshi contemplated an environment where economic incentives are aligned and exist solely within Bitcon's economic ecosystem. The post was not at all about scaling. Scaling debate is just a byproduct of what are now known as misaligned incentives. Yes, you offered proof of the way Satoshi envisioned we would scale. But there was never an intent to prevent other solutions either. He also did not purposefully include transaction malleability as part of the code. It was an unforeseen outcome without which we would be able to implement and measure all possible solutions. 
I also already addressed the AsicBoost issue - it is not inherently bad, and it is indeed a neat optimization. The problem arises when a company can step outside of the ecosystem and keep everyone else from partaking in the optimization via the patent system.
So yes, you pointed out a sidechain that exists that circumvented transaction malleability. But again, that's not my point. There are some solutions that are not viable as a result of an unforeseen outcome of the code.

C'mon man. You're either actually not getting my point, or you're trolling. I've iterated my point a few times now, and you keep bringing up things unrelated to my point. I have to deduce that you're trolling / pushing an agenda.

This is very true! We would certainly advise that anyone who uses our service submit their documents for review to an attorney barred and located in their state of residence.

Here are a few articles that can help you:
Edit: Transaction malleability makes it almost impossible to implement sidechains in a safe way.

I'm not "deciding" anything. His vision certainly matters, because it is the foundation upon which the entire ecosystem has been built. Game theory didn't cover all possible outcomes, only the ones that could be known. As such, we've had unforeseen outcomes arise that were outside of the "rules" by which the game was created. 
Also, thanks for the grammatical correction. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:33:18
With merged mining. Again, there is still a road block for anyone to scale in the manner they deem fit. Which is transaction malleability. But I think you get that, you're just pushing an agenda.

@_date: 2017-06-08 18:03:22
I actually agree with this sentiment. Which is why I didn't actually say, "Satoshi would have wanted it this way." I've iterated the arguments ad nauseum in this thread. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:57:52
I understand the sentiment. I'm not here to worship or praise Satoshi. It's only to point out that there now exists a misalignment of economic incentives that he did not contemplate. It is important to consider "what he wanted" in the context of what we're trying to accomplish and for what reason. It's not at all about, "follow Satoshi because he's Satoshi."
