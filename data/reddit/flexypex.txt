Yeah, I bet people will use that after what happened to their currency.

Did you really mean to write 1$/BTC? With only 21 million potential Bitcoins that doesn't leave a whole lot of money in the market for us to play with.

Panicky newbies, high TX fees, long confirmation times, mountains of FUD, naturally correction to an altogether too quick rise. Probably a little bit of all of the above.

Yes, the ISIS situation is exactly why I believe that the Kurds will war with their host countries. We've given the Kurds weapons because we don't want to die against ISIS, but what happens when ISIS is gone? Kurds don't want to live under other peoples - fine, but the territory of the theoretical nation of Kurdistan encompasses large portions of territory owned by Turkey and Iran (and others), both have militaries you don't want to fuck around with. Either way, we really shouldn't be arguing about middleeastern politics on a bitcoin subreddit, so like I said before. congratulations and my best wishes to your mother.

That isn't how nationality works. Same way that U.S. liberals just have to cope with Trump, they don't get to just leave and make their own country at the drop of a hat. You can expect this topic to get more and more touchy in the future as I expect friction between Kurds and the nations they live in to only increase in the future. That being said, congratulations and give your mother by best wishes.

Like Elon Musk's internet satellites?

If the price dipped every week on the regular, would you buy then, or would you still be posting this question asking for when the *really big* dip was going to happen?

You think rich people got rich paying 60$ a year for a bloody bank account? Rich people pay attention to these kinds of things.
