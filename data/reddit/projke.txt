No problem. I honestly have no idea how Bitcoin and DogeCoin both have a C rating...well BTC has a C+ and DOGE has a C...but still. They argue that BTC is Fundamentally an A. The only thing that is holding BTC's rating back is it's price volatility and scalability. I'm excited to see their regrade after Lightning Network

They don't match at a 1d:1wk scale

It's just a waitlist for those interested in beta testing it. You don't have to pay a monthly premium. 
You just have to set up a local wallet on your phone and join the network. If enough people join, then it can work offline.

That is why we are going to backtest it for previous bear markets

You can deface your competition, compete in the market place and stealth shill crypto on fiat notes all in one

haha, you can always write "Fuck Fiat, Use Bitcoin" �� Maybe one day a bill will find its way back to you with that written on it. The point is to shift people's interest to crypto ;)

I once saw "Buy Bitcoin 2014" on a $5 bill back in my freshman year of college 3 years ago...I figured it'd be cool if everyone did something similar to boost the token economy

Let's say a management app (iOS &amp; Android) existed for said bluetooth hardware wallet. What if you limited the connection's bandwidth such that the wallet only accepts a certain amount of data (some random amount predetermined when the management app and hardware wallet first sync) and ignores any amount different from it? I think having a camera installed on a hardware wallet would be too costly (in terms of $$, internal space and processing power).

The future is mobile. That's why I have such a hard time taking the current status of hardware wallets seriously. Ledger, Trezor, and KeepKey all require cables. USB-A to Micro cables to be exact.

Good point. But the information being sent from the mobile device to the hardware wallet is pretty trivial (a signature request). Same with the information being sent from the hardware wallet to the mobile device (a signed transaction). The display would be used to mitigate that risk by displaying the 'send to' address. 
And if the wallet handled firmware updates over cable rather than over air. Then, it should be pretty safe. Your thoughts?

Hmmm, and if you could physically limit the range of the bluetooth transmission to say...3 feet, would you still be paranoid?
