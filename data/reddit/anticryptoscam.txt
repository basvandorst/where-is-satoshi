Thank you Shro yes this is a necessity, this is the first time I use reddit as a registered user, I do not know too much. Can we have multiple admin in a a subreddit? If Yes go ahead, open it, my account is too new to open one. The main purpose of the sub reddit will be to centralize the info on all the scams and invite people to publish the scam via the form on anti-crypto-scam.info and participate on the forum to create a strong community against scammers.
