First off, i'm sorry for your loss.
BUT: You installed software where you neither knew what it was doing, nor did you check the background. That's borderline suicidal when it comes to Computers.
Secondly, you are having around 15k in/on a PC that's connected to the internet. Now, i don't know about you, but if I was having that kinda money lying around in my home with (virtually) anyone getting access to it, i'd be scared (and remember: the only PC that is REALLY safe is the one that's shut down. everything else is compromised).
Sorry, you were not tech-savy at all. You were doing the same thing i did when i was a kid. "yeah, sounds good, what could go wrong?"
Take it as a lesson...

so you have 5 miners and a fan, equalling 6 full speed USBs (5V, 0.5 A)
that's 2.5W per USB, totalling at 15W
Now i don't know what you're paying on electricity, but i'm guessing not more than 25c per kWh.
Hardware itself cost you nothing, so that leaves you with:  0,95 $ per day.
For self check and calc.
Edit: I forgot to mention, those things usually give 330MH/s, *5 = 1650, if anyone wonders why i used 1650

I guess that's usually what ppl are doing, since Win is still above 90% of Desktop OS'
If they have linux on on&amp;Offline PCs, chances are still a lot lower to even get Malware in the first place.

330MH/s per device
@_date: 2013-11-15 09:03:21
Just as a follow-up: Today the first of our ASIC-Devices launched, getting solid 110 shares / 30 mins, 220 per hour. Therefore, at the moment and on the PPS of BTCGuild, generating 0.09 european cents per day.
Thanks for all the concerns and the info on my question, and i hope you all have a good day.

We know about the Break-Even point, it's more a gimmick than a real try to make money from it. It's a "We'll see what comes out of it" thing.
Still though, the question remains...
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:36:31
Thx for the answer. Oh well, looks like i need to get a RaPi then.
@_date: 2013-11-08 22:38:53
But mine is more reliable
@_date: 2013-11-09 10:29:27
Thank's a lot, have my upvote.
We're running this on a linux notebook, since that is our "server". But i believe our pools do have notifications when the miners go down anyway, so it should work

Or you could teleport everyone who right-clicked on that chest a few blocks (+- some blocks, &amp; random direction of course) away.
Makes for more confusion as soon as it goes online :-P
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:03:57
Why is this worrying?
Didn't you follow the most basic rule: "only invest as much money as you can afford to lose"?
I mean, i get that there are SOME ppl out there who have loads of money in it, but really now? Some have lived years without that money, and suddenly, they would die if it crashed?
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:41:49
I guess this is kind of a stupid question, but i really don't know any better right now.
Say i'm using a VM as the Offline-Storage (Connectivity cut, of course). Would a single backup of the VM right at the start (after installing the offline-wallet) suffice or would i need to do a backup every week or so?
@_date: 2013-03-07 20:52:52
the wallet.dat is nothing more than a text file (for simplicity now, its a bit more than that, but for understanding, it's enough) with all your addresses.
As soon as you have got all your adresses from the network, you can upload it somewhere, and never have to sync it again.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:44:48
Honestly now?
We are still in this, after 3 bubble pops. What makes you worry that much?
Hey, yes, it MIGHT pop down to sub-500$ soon, and then? it will rise up just like all the other times, and it will be more $ per BTC than before, just like all the other times.
Why are ppl so worried that it will suddenly crash to 0?
@_date: 2013-11-14 14:48:58
A good advise from me is to only "spend" as much as you can afford to lose without it hurting you.
If 400 is all you got, and you might as well go on a vacation with that, better spend it on that vacation.
If 400 is an "easy loss" for you that you wouldn't care about, than you should be allright.
@_date: 2013-11-23 10:38:34
Allright, just for you: you WANT more ppl using it, because more ppl using it = less BTC for everyone else = more $ per BTC. Straight Fact and maths there.
For everyone to use it, it has to be user-friendly and noob-friendly. Again, straight fact.
So YOU suggest that you don't want the noobs in, or the noobs should go to someone who's playing a bank. If you do this, you are giving the power away from users to organizations AGAIN. This is what has happened years ago, because, y'know, we could ALL life without banks, it just happened in the past that someone didn't want to take over responsibility.
This would be the wrong way, history would repeat itself, and we would be where we are now, just with BTC instead of USD or EUR or whatever.
Got that?
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:00:00
With all our Bitcoins we are going to steal... (pause, for effect)
THE MOOOOOON
@_date: 2013-11-23 09:16:59
So you are saying you want to take away one of the pro's of bitcoin (being your own bank, that is) just because you can't be asked to help newcomers?
Start using your brain, please.
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:39:49
As you are from Vienna as well, any luck finding ANYTHING that accepts Bitcoins here?
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:05:28
I believe you are missing that the offline-computers SHOULD use Linux.. And try finding malware there ;)
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:41:52
YOU SHOULD NOT BE STORING 10 THOUSAND DOLLARS OF FIAT ON YOUR PHONE
SIMPLE AS THAT.
YOU ARE NOT RUNNING AROUND WITH 10K DOLLARS IN FIAT ON THE STREETS, ARE YOU?
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:56:37
20$ per ASIC, Delivery Date Monday, 11th.
Money spent is 10c per kWh, with 2.5W per ASIC this comes down to around 2c per day, which i think this should make at least some profit.
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:27:43
ok, then think this: for malware on Windows to auto-inject, you'd have to write it in a Win-Native language (i guess c with typical windows libraries, etc)
This code is very unlikely to work the same, if at all, under Unix. That's where the security comes into play.
