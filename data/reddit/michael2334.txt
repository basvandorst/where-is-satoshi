Why do you say that? Let's hope not.

That's why I have such a love hate relationship with crypto haha. One moment your celebrating your gains before bed band then you wake up to being down 10%.

Maybe it was just the timing then that made me question it. It seemed like a bot picked up the headline and traded off of that information.

There would also probably be a lot of "buying gf, will pay in bitcoin!"

Yes the US. Can I go through a non us exchange then and transfer it?

Ok I'll look into this. Thank you for the info.

Can someone explain to me how the futures market will actually help bitcoin? In my opinion I think cryptos are still too far in the infancy stage to be traded as futures. 
If large banks or others who write off cryptos as a scam short bitcoin what does that do to the image and long term success? 
It'll be interesting to see and I'm hoping for the best, but I'm really skeptical.

So if you look into your crystal ball do you think this will be a positive thing for cryptos? 
I can see it going either way, but as the date is approaching it's making me a little nervous. 
New capital flowing in could definitely be a great thing. When I hear the CEO of a major bank such as JPM talk how he does about BTC I start to think Wall Street will be the ones solely determining the price.

So you aren't scared that the crypto market is being put to the test very soon? I feel like there will be very large movements across all cryptos in either direction when the futures open.
