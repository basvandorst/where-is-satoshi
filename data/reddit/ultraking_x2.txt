I use the r/funny thread as an indicator that most people are still completely uneducated and that we're still very much early adopters. Eventually, years from now these people will start to understand the benefits and they'll FOMO in when it's already too late.

Unfortunately it looks like many of the people commenting in the r/funny thread do actually still believe that.

You should probably check the price every few hours for the next day or two. As soon as you feel the price may have reached a minimum and it starts rising significantly again you should consider buying in.

But TA often does work over short timescales because it tends to create self-fulfilling prophecies. This is mostly true for 'simple' TA patterns that many people can recognize and hence are more likely to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Things like for example wedges, basic resistance and support levels and lines, etc...
I do agree that anything more complicated than that is bullshit
