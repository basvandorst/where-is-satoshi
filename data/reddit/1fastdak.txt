If you been here long enough you kind of become numb to the dips. I remember freaking out when I first got in. Anything over a few percent drop and I was like OMG Bitcoin is DEAD!! Now I just look and lol.
@_date: 2018-01-31 09:04:05
Uhh. you set up a lightning node to make withdraws from your bitcoin address. Then you buy stuff and a network is created between you and final sellers to create a pool of debt. When the channel is closed the final amount is debited from your bitcoin account. Seems simple enough Mr schillin'. Even if I had no idea what I was talking about calling someone that is not informed about it does not make them a shill so you better check your definition.

All cryptos are going to have growing pains as they get larger. Decentralized solutions just happen to be more difficult to implement. In the end, do you want your currency decentralized or do you want a faster centralized currency run by banks/government. If your crypto is centralized and isnt run by banks/goverment it will be.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:06:09
That's because even investors are still looking at bitcoin as an investment instead of a currency. At this time they are pretty much correct. Sometime within the next 10 years I believe this mentality will be changing completely.

Wow, that is damning. Like they needed anymore bad press. This is also a gapping security hole. You can't leave something open like that, most especially when billions of dollars are on the line. People could do a man in the middle or dns attacks and shut down whatever miners they wanted.

What real world experience do you have of being in space. You have seen so much proof that it, in the end, is the only logical conclusion. Plenty of proof, just do some research. If it works on a massive world-changing scale, we will have to wait and see. There is no magic looking glass and every decentralized crypto is going to have scaling pains. It's just our best decentralized option right now. Also if you think that 8mb blocks is going to be "world changing" then you are still not even in the ballpark of what crypto needs to become.

Doesn't lighting conceal your identity by hopping through other people? I always thought of it a bit like onion routing but I am not sure how much info is carried from node to final destination. 
I think full nodes do help the network but in a different way. More like a router that helps find paths across the network to make sure you don't get isolated areas.
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:13:01
How so? It the most decentralized. Segwits growing, mempool shrinking, and Lightning network is expanding at a scary pace. Fast, cheap, reliable and not easily shut down or controlled like some other popular currencies.

Its not the miners driving up the Fee's, it's supply and demand. The can only process so many transactions. Good part is that while they are making all this money they can use it to upgrade and do more transactions. Bitcoin network is now stronger.

I didn't really take that into account. Seems quite scary in the end game though. The fed is using its trump card to keep the dollar from going deflationary instead of using it to try to stop a desperate economic downturn. Thats a bold strategy for them cotton lets see if it pays off.
@_date: 2019-07-08 03:31:55
I agree that the market cap of bitcoin is complete and utter bullshit but wealth has a finite amount. There is a limited amount of goods and services to be purchased. 
Lets say bitcoin skyrockets but the value of the dollar stays the same. There are 21 million lambos but there are 21 million people with us dollars ready to buy them, there are also 21 million bitcoiners ready to buy them. What do you think is going to happen to the price. It would be like this for everything. We are pulling value from other currencies and assets no way around it.
@_date: 2019-07-30 03:38:25
I don't even get this. Why would the fed cut now when the dow is holding fine. I mean if they cut when there isn't a real problem where the fuck do they go when we have a real problem like in 2008. The only reason I can think of is they are anticipating something bad on the horizon.
@_date: 2019-07-13 14:34:49
As of now you would need a coinbase card or something similar. DO NOT keep large amounts on coinbase though. Get a cold storage device for your main savings and use coinbase like you would your wallet. In a few years this will change though. The 2017 rally really got the ball rolling on the development of bitcoin and introduced the name to the masses.
@_date: 2019-07-18 05:42:53
So true. Made a sizeable investment in a tech a decade ago but the public went for the more expensive flashy tech instead of the super cheap almost as good stuff. In the end it was so expensive it never really reached mass adoption. Sometimes the general public just doesn't really think logically, and by logically I mean at all.

@_date: 2019-07-09 00:37:04
It is a worthless calculation. You cant use it for anything. It's not the total amount invested in bitcoin. You cant use it to compare to other currencys since there is no liquidity. You cant even use it as a fair comparison to other cryptos since their liquidity is infinitely worse and it would be way off anyway because millions of bitcoins that have been lost are still used in the equation. As for wealth being generated maybe I worded it wrong but the point was wealth is being transferred not generated. There is a only so much goods and services at any point in time to purchase.
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:47:26
Miners are also nodes. Nodes themselves are more than required for security. They create a redundancy to the network that is required for the network to operate properly. If you had all of your money in bitcoin and had one line from you to some miner in China all the way across the ocean would you feel safe? What if China decided not to let traffic from new york in, what if the cable got cut, what if the president says we don't like China anymore and shuts down communications. Nodes provide redundancy to bounce transfers every which direction ensuring that a final transaction is completed and confirmed.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:06:43
Why do you say that? Even if it holds nowhere near today's levels I think it will always have a use. Most especially in countries that do not have a very stable currency.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:09:49
You are correct. At this time it is a better coin for transferring. Here is the kicker though. When BCH grows the size and latency grows also.  When we get to a few percent of the population  using crypto this is going to cripple BCH and the effects will be magnified. Nodes will end up only in huge server farms due to size. This will kill the decentralization we are all working toward. This is coming from someone who still owns all his BCH from the split. Some of the smartest computer engineers in the world realize this but some salesmen and some scammers (Ver &amp; Friends) are saying they have solved everything and to just trust them.
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:13:32
Can't really put numbers behind a definition like that. How far do you think the 1st world countries/ultrawealthy would go to shut it down if they felt severely threatened. Do you think they would shut down just Amazon and Alibaba servers or go a bit farther? We could go into an entire world war 3 digital war scenario where the majority of the internet could be wiped out. Governments have killed hundreds of thousands of people to maintain power. If they felt severely threatened by crypto how far do you think they would go to shut it down. A few server farms maybe, a few hundred household nodes/miners, a few thousand household nodes/miners, a few hundred thousand household nodes/miners. Right now crypto is a baby, practically nothing in the grand scheme of things but maybe someday it will be peoples entire life savings. Security is the number 1 most important and decentralization is the largest obstacle we have to overcome.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:08:32
That is what a lot of us are worried about. Things moving too fast confusing investors and the average person who might be interested in crypto. Bitcoin being flipped may be the worst thing that could happen to crypto. Mass confusion between investors and exchanges about what is what. I still own all my coins from the fork but if this somehow ends up happening I believe it will be devastating to all of crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:35:37
That's the neat part. LN network will be like the wallet you keep in your pocket. You keep few hundred bucks in your pocket for beer/gas money but you will keep your major funds safely on chain. Money from your (LN) wallet would be instantly transferred with only miniscule transmission fees.

LN network will basically divide the transaction fees with other users. So divide today's transaction fee by a few dozen to a few thousand. This depends on how many transactions are used by that coffee company before the LN channel is closed.

Yes I know where your coming from, but the whole point of bitcoin is to more securely store value than banks can do. Inflation, 2008 bank bailout, 2% vendor debit/credit charge bla bla bla.

If it is competition it has the ability to seriously hurt coinbase. There is so much money involved in exchanges these days I think Microsoft would go big and could completely dwarf most if not all exchanges. With all the coinbase (deserved) hate lately, it is a prime time for some large corp to move in on their market share. Also, Microsoft's crypto endorsement could be good for all bitcoin investors. Or this could be nothing.

Yes, evolution and time will eventually balance out volatility. Just think of a new country just starting out.
 They need a currency and create one. That shit is going to be all over the place until a price is finally settled on. The only way around this is to back your currency with something else of value. Like how the US used to do with gold.

There are not that many bitcoin for sale currently. Only a small fraction of bitcoins are day traded and if the banks start buying them up the price is going to skyrocket. The long time holders who hold most coins are not going to sell. There best chance would be to skyrocket bitcoin and then dump to scare the hell out of the holders and get them to sell.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:29:23
So size has no bearing? Why are we just making 8 meg blocks and not 256 and saying forget the LN? decentralization is the need for nodes and miners to be spread apart in as many countries/cities/homes as humanly possible. If you put them in a few server farms a quick treaty or two between a few countries/world banks could shut it down in days. Seriously though if you could explain why the size won't effect our current infrastructure I would like to know. I still own both coins so as long as crypto keeps gaining momentum it does not matter to me monitarily. I would just like it to be the best it can and not get dragged down by something that will cause a lot of fud, fail and then delay progress.
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:33:48
Also no, there is no reason for 256 meg blocks now, but are we going to fork every few months. Bitcoin has doubled its size how many times this year? How quickly will this the block size increase just outrun current transfer/storage technology?

@_date: 2019-07-08 02:53:40
Your just factoring in the currency part and forgetting the store of value which I believe will be the larger portion. Im sure Bitcoin will be taking portions of precious metals, precious stones, land, art, and other assets that people typically store wealth in today.

Its not end of story its only the beginning. When cryptos become mainstream every average Joe is going to have thousands of transactions per year. This is including people who dont have business or tax degrees, people who have no idea about this stuff. There will be children, elderly, and your local crack head. There is going to need to be some type of automated way to figure this or its just going to be ignored.

Why would miners move to BCH? Looks like difficulty will be going down and the reward/difficulty ratio for BTC is already way higher.

Give me a nations money and I care not who makes its laws. 
The Federal Reserve is who we want to weaken. It is not the federal government but actually a large group of bankers. They have been given permission by our government to just create money out of thin air and loan it out. The funny part is they loan trillions of dollars to same government that gave them this power and then collect interest on it. The amount of power this group wields is unimaginable. Money is all powerful especially in a democracy where candidates with the most funds usually win. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:51:08
Even if this ends up being possible it is going to create mass confusion to the larger populous. I'm sure you, I and most people on this sub could watch crypto news at least once a day to keep up on current forks. You have to remember though the average person doesn't know a bit from a Byte. The next gen may start to absorb this information but I am doubtful this gen will comprehend. As of now, you have to be pretty IT competent to even understand how most of this works. Try to ask the average person what a public and private key are. The majority of people are still trying to figure out how Netflix magically lets you binge-watch "Friends". If crypto is to grow it needs to be as simple as possible. Otherwise, we will be stuck at our current level or less. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 02:04:40
What mechanism do they use to tax you then? As of right now the only way I know of in the U.S. is to tax you when you sell. I dont know of any laws if you buy things directly using BTC as there is never US Dollars involved. Is there another way Im not aware of? If bitcoin works out with lightning and everything am I supposed to start getting my snickers bars appraised to calculate the exact amount of taxes I must then pay.

IDK about $20K but it seems like a classic short squeeze to me. (a few big candles as shorters try to stop the hemorrhaging.)
@_date: 2018-08-17 00:59:07
Shorting is when someone basically borrows a stock and immediately sells it. In the future he must Pay back whoever he borrowed the stock from with an equal amount hoping that the price went down so he can keep some of the difference. A short squeeze is when the price start to go up and the shorter start buying into the stock to effectively create a stop loss. If the stock goes up then the stock you bought is worth more. If the stock goes down you can buy cheaper to repay whoever you borrowed from. There is a 3rd person here who tries to predict a short squeeze and buys early before the shorter which helps create the initial pump. That can be a high risk/reward position.

TBH, good for you. The market is a fickle beast and if you think one year is gonna determine the fate of bitcoin that is laughable. If you have invested for over two years in a row at pretty much any time in bitcoin you have seen some pretty incredible gains. Moreso you have helped in constructing the most decentralized currency the world has ever seen. Right now it might seem trivial to some as it has only helped a few third world countries but it will grow, and stabilize over time. Before it is done, first world countries will be nervous to know that its citizens will have a cheap, safe, easily accessible option to their currency.

I think people are confusing Market cap with how much money has been used to purchase bitcoins. They are two very different things. The actual amount used is just a fraction of that 68.5 billion. not all 18 million people paid anywhere near $3,800 for their coins. A very large percantage were bought for next to nothing and have been lost or locked away in old wallets which might never open.

Anybody know how this is suposed to work? sounds just like we are selling at an exchange and buying with dollars. I guess that would be ok as long as it one smooth transaction via QR code. Are we able use a normal coin wallet or will it be required to be on an exchange or sometype of starbucks app? Seems like a somebody that doesnt understand tech laid down some rules and just told IT to make it work.

@_date: 2018-10-23 02:30:58
It very well may. I'm pretty sure they will be purchasing coins OTC. This would create a delayed effect as coins that are usually drizzled into the market start to dry up. Then there is ETFs that will start poppin and all of the latest bitcoin and mining upgrades that are finally being rolled out and adopted. Still waiting on some out of the box bitcoin and lightning solutions along with some more lightening wallets to help with adoption but they will come. Finally there is the Halvening.

I think it will be more of a cultural switch. All most have ever known is the dollar and its ingrained into society. It could take generations to be fully adopted.

The fed is not exactly a bank. They control US monetary policy. They cannot even be audited correctly because of their right to privacy with an international central bank, which I might add is completely fucked. They have several other rules that protect them from being audited fully by the US government also. One example is  "Im a member of the FOMC so fuck off elected president of the United States and/or supreme court justice". Now do you think that they give a shit about what they are allowed to do if no one can audit. I don't mean to be a dick but I think you need to do some research on how the fed works. Our government was designed by our forefathers around checks and balances but the fed has slipped out.

People used to say this same crap when bitcoin was under $200. My theory for adoption the last few years is "in order" early adopters, techies and libertarians, speculative investors, institutional investors, mass adoption. If you dont think bitcoin is going to make the institutional step then don't invest now. Seems almost obvious to me that it is though. Bitcoin infrastructure is growing extremely quickly and ultimately that will dictate price not the crazy price swings the last few years.

Pretty much. I watched it go all the way up and crash all the way down. Just look at a bitcoin price over the last 7 years. It repeats over and over. Not rocket science to see that after the crash we will enter the slow bleed down period. The confidence is slowly restored and bulls will return. Might be a year or two. Also I wasnt waiting for 4-5k I was waiting for slow bleed down period.

Miners use processing power to compete for a  reward and transaction fees every block. Hashrate is combined processing power. Seems that not many miners are interested in earning SV or Cash as of late and most miners are moving toward bitcoin.

This is true but they "and their contributors" like to repaint things in a way to mislead less educated people. They will use words from their toolbox like "war, terrorism, drug money" and a host of other words to slander it and make it look like some sort of unpatriotic, criminal, money laundering, blood money currency. Just you watch, these words can and will come up from them as bitcoin currency replaces many sectors of our current world banking system. They have billions on the line and will not let it go so easily. Disturbingly yet most assuredly they could give a fuck about our "liberty".
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:24:31
I don't think it would have lasted that long personally but that's only one issue. The largest issue was not about the size but with transparency. We cannot let bitcoin under ANY circumstances be controlled by a centralized party and we need complete transparency on every upgrade/fork to prevent it. Any attempt to avoid complete transparency should be immediately shitcanned. IMMEDIATELY! I'm not using the exclamation to be a dick but to provide emphasis. The most powerful people in the world have a stake in this and one slip could spell the end of what we have built.

When a coin "forks" it is an exact copy of the entire chain before it. If you owned a piece of that chain it is copied exactly and you get an equal amount of coins on the copy/pasted chain as you owned on the original.

It is not bad advice. Coinbase is super user-friendly for beginners. But yes I agree with you and recommend to move on to gdax after you get your feet wet and see how everything works.

Depending on the exchange it might not be a bad thing. While you are in an exchange there is no chance of a replay when you sell because you are not actually using the blockchain. The exchange MUST support both coins though or you will not get your forked coins.

No, it is the same as previous forks. The only difference is that with this split the b2x supporter are saying its an upgrade to bitcoin and trying to take the bitcoin name (BTC) instead of (B2X). If by some off chance this does happen it will still be a fork and the current bitcoin will be renamed therefore still leaving 2 chains.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:23:18
It is not an exact date but it will happen when a certain point on the chain is mined. It will happen in around 7 days.

@_date: 2017-11-09 13:26:12
Seems to me like you are still going to need two chains. How else are you going to decide who is going to be the real bitcoin. What if I came up with a new "upgrade" to bitcoin today. I'm gonna change a few things like block size and increase how much the miners get. I'll also add a feature saying that all transactions must go through company abc.com for a small fee to be split between me and the top 50 exchanges. This would be more beneficial for the miners and exchanges but gives users no way to vote. The only fair way I see is to have it fork and have the financially dominant chain take the bitcoin name. Otherwise we are at the mercy of the exchanges deciding what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2019-02-09 03:59:17
Think of it like your local sports team. They have been on a longggg losing streak but your a loyal fan and keep going to all the games anyway. All of a sudden they get a good win. Its nice to see a win after all that even if it doesn't mean they are going to the superbowl anytime soon.

No 2x is gone and for good reason. They said it was an upgrade and part of it was. In the end such a small upgrade was like trying to fill a swimming pool with a glass of water. If we are really going to upgrade it needs to be at least 10x better than this, transparent, well tested, replay protected, and decentralized.

Yes, at the fork it is more like 2 separate but exact copies of the blockchain. It does get a bit tricky here though because if the forked coin does not have replay protection and you send your b2x to another party that exact transmission could be reused or "replayed" by anyone watching to also send your BTC to the same party.

You don't think demand would drop if people stopped hoarding gold? There would be such a glut of gold in the market that there is no way any manufacturing could use it up making the excess pretty much worthless. 
Seriously, google supply and demand. It is the main model of price determination. If there is more of a product than needed on the market then the price will fall. The gold market is almost completly held up by eveybody buying up all the product and using it as a store of value. If all that product were dumped on the market then the price would plummet. There is no question that we produce way more gold than what is actually needed.
You theory about demand is ridiculous in that supply is just as important. example.. People would pay a million dollars for vaccinations, but there is a large supply and competition so its $30. It has absolutely nothing to do with what people will pay but how much supply there is for the demand.

Not about the most import part though. The largest and most important transactions cannot be audited. All transactions with foreign banks and governments or any transaction made by members of the Federal Open Market Committee are completely unauditable.  Billions just gone poof! in a keystroke and nobody is allowed to even question it. I remember Remember Bernanke saying if we decided to audit these it would be a "nightmare scenario". Sounded like a threat to me. Also don't go the the federal reserves website on how the federal reserve is audited. Their bullshit game is quite strong.

Goldbugs are self proclaimed long gold purchasers. The term is also used by economists for investors who are long gold. Of course gold is being hoarded not much else to do with it. Just look at all of the national reserves where the hell else would it be going if only 10 percent goes into electronics. Goldbugs and Countries buy it up and hold. It's only worth so much because they hodl. Wait that sounds familiar. Here is the wiki that shows the world governments hoarding gold. 
Golds intrinsic value is barely jack shit without store of value, as is bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-24 17:55:43
Real world utility? If gold were valued for just that prices would absolutely fall through the floor. I could build 1,000 motherboards with just a few grams as it is barely used. As for jewelry it is a terrible metal because it is far to soft and there are much better and cheaper alternatives. That is why they mix it with those to make a useful piece.  Gold would lose 90%+ if it was a "real world utility" and not as a store of value.

@_date: 2019-12-24 18:42:02
Your confused, if people did not hoard gold as a store of value the supply would far far exceed the demand. That is exactly how the market works. Jewelry if you ask me is also being used as a store of value to show off and keep wealth. Otherwise better more suitable metals would be used. So if you pull that store of value the price of gold would be absolutly decimated. Bitcoin and gold are far more alike than different in that respect. Bitcoin just trades that last 10% of value for its ease of transport and soon to be deflation among  other positives.

I never said gold was going to fall.  I'm telling you without people buying up 90% of the mined gold every year for store of value that the so called intrinsic value would fall exponentially. Supply and demand. The same goes for bitcoin. My argument is they are both almost completely dependent on hodlers except that gold may stop at $100 or $200 because a very tiny portion is used in electronics. The rest of the price is just speculation and store of value.
@_date: 2019-12-24 23:50:45
You should loop back up and reread what I wrote because I dont think you are getting what I'm saying. 10% of gold produced each year goes onto electronics that leaves 90% for the store of value guys. What do you think would happen if the store of value guys said I'm not buying. A Hoard every year.
The actual "real world utilitys" of gold are so tiny compared to the amount produced its ridiculous and would in no way prop up the price of gold if the store of value guys stopped buying it all. Everybody keeps waving the "utility" flag but that's all bullshit because without goldbugs hoarding 90% it would drop through the floor. We already have mined enough over the last few hundred years to keep our electronics industry going for decades. 
If store of value guys stop buying gold its fucked by 90 percent. If Bitcoin guys stop buying its fucked by 100%. They are both almost completly dependent on people deciding they are worth the price with almost jack shit backing them up.
The gold bug guys keep up the same argument about it being useful in manufacturing but that really only supports the last 10 percent of value.

That's logic. Same as people investing in their 401k year after year. Stock market has an average of of 9% gain over long term with all kinds of bumps. Rule of large numbers always wins. While bitcoin does not have as long of a record it still has a long term trend upward. Nothing has changed for the worse with the product and no real competitors have been introduced so there is no real reason for the trend to stop until saturation has been reached. Since the older generations are moving out and the younger computer literate generations are moving in, add to that the total computer user base is growing year after year I can only logically conclude that crypto will continue to grow. HODL

If the FOMO goes the same way as last year I believe it will be bigger, Much Bigger. Before the only way to get coins was to have cash available, join an exchange then go through the identification process and what not. Most of the worlds money isn't in cash sitting in checking accounts. The bulk of money is in 401k and institutions which is very hard, illegal or next to impossible to move to crypto. The big gates are opening soon. If we get serious action from them fomo will kick in and then moon. If not we are going to fall pretty hard.

Because gold is a pain the dick to buy and trade. Trust me my parents started buying coins and bars but the price between exchange price and actual purchase price is ridiculous. They have given up on that. Valuable weapons have been considered but once again a pain in the ass to store, buy and sell. Real estate is where they ended up but still get drained on upkeep and taxes. Bitcoin solves all these problems but is way to new and needs time to mature and stabilize.

They can for awhile. Everytime they do it shakes out the emotional investors and they sell their coins thus the market drops the amount they sold + emotional investors. What we are starting to see happen now is there are only hardened investors left and they will not sell. That is why the dips have become so much smaller.

Yes, but you owned a piece of gold before and now you just own a promise. So I guess how much do you trust promises by our government or the Federal Reserve. Technically the dollar is not owned by the elected US Government but by the privately owned federal reserve who can basically decide what its worth. Some people say bitcoin is BS because there is nothing backing it, the US dollar being owned by banksters that can print their own money is actually far more ridiculous.

3 steps to win an argument if you know you are wrong.
1: Discredit your opponent - BTC is volatile and will be used for crime.
2: Ask Distracting Questions - Why was the ransom for the virus (wannacry ransomware) collected in bitcoin? Why has China cracked down on bitcoin?”
3: Claim Authority -  Only Government/Corporate backed/created currencies will work. All others are junk.
Its a by the book technique that can be used for many things. I see it mostly in politics though. This one is so blatantly obvious it like it came off of some college professors outline.

Fees won't drop as much as you think. As time goes by bitcoin gains value so while you only get paid 1 bitcoin then it is worth maybe 8 bitcoins now. 
A lot of guys are not gonna trust Google with their life savings or serious investment money on a centralized network. What if Google goes bankrupt, is taken out by North Korean missiles, Falls into the ocean, Gets destroyed by some disgruntled IT worker who hands the private keys to Russian spies, is taken over by a foreign government. Why would Chinese people invest in an American currency? Bitcoin, immune, immune, immune. Just throw it on cold storage and its safe. Centralized money could be changed and more created causing inflation. Governments like to do this by printing themselves a little extra. Remember the bank bailout of 2008. That was my money they were stealing. Devaluing my money to give to the richers when they fucked up.
Yea they are gonna tax it but that's just one of two things we can be certain of. Death and Taxes. It's not really a rich get richer thing. The rich are already rich in gold and stocks that go up. If anything this gives the middle class a chance to roll the dice. The poor are just fucked either way.

not so much the idea as the execution. The fork was an test to see how the larger block sizes would work out.

my reasoning at least isnt cherry picking dates to make yourself sound more convincing. How many people knew about bitcoin before last year? how many people knew about the dollar? People are just learning about the tech. If people are just learning about a tech then id say its in its infancy.

because we endlessly catch the midrange banks in fraud and corrupt activites but somehow we think the largest unauditable bank would never do such a thing.

it was on Ethereum World News. They just confirmed it on ICE's website an hour ago.

Last year im not too surprised as it was sky rocketing. More interesting that it is there this year after the crash.

Meh. VPN, Dialup, Satellite. The world is getting smaller and short of going north korea not much is going to stop communications with the outside world.

While your point is valid they cant have a "world" currency that they control. That doest make sense. I think they would make a lot of sacrifices to try to break the dollar but have no idea how or where they might even try to begin.

TX fees are scaling issues that are being worked on and implemented. If people would have just switched to segwit addresses the fees were only a quarter of the bullshit $40 people were trying pass off. Its like they were trying to pay the most that they could. Also the attack that was going on then wouldn't work now. The network is so much stronger and there are so many rigs just sitting not being used but if the tx price went up the network would light up like a christmas tree.
I only know one homeless person in my area and she has a kindle fire. She sits at mcdonalds a lot for wifi and power.
Too easy to hack. Nope bitcoin has never been hacked.
Not private. Yup it is not private YET. There are plenty of projects that will change this on the way.
Inflation and Mismanagement. It has been said a million times what you are supposed to do with your coins when you buy them. I will not repeat it. Wild price swings are going to happen to any new currency especially when it is growing as fast as bitcoin. They will calm in the next decade. Inflation will also crawl to almost 0.

Might be here a bit but well see. A lot of people are saying a few quarters but I'm not sure. If bakkt ever gets moving and if we get a bitcoin backed ETF it could get rather lively.

I think you underestimate the geek factor here. There is not any real money in the lightning network right now but lots of us have been having a ball dicking around with it for months. Super cool uber geek shit right here.

In a hardware or paper wallet it pretty much is.

Im 100% sure that bitcoin in 10 years will be completly different. Not what id like but im sure there will be banks handling coin for people that wish to go that route. By then bitcoin should be no harder than your average online banking we have today.
As for the 10$ charges that same attack would not work today and was unsustainable anyway. It was just growing to fast. In a few years more layer 2 solutions and batching will be implemented to keep on chain transactions to a minimum. Just keep an open mind, It seems like eveybody wants a perfect world changing product right now but we hopefully have time to get it there and get it right.

Phishing attacks are always gonna be a problem with anything online. You cant stop people from giving away their passwords. Point is that you could brute force most banking passwords if you captured the username and hash. Its just not possible with bitcoin. Once bitcoin is secured properly it is secure. There is no hacking it, brute force or otherwise.

Well yea it fluctuates. Its a completely new type of currency that nobody is sure about or at least skeptical. Any fiat currency is going to have a very rough start until the dust settles, which could actually be another decade.

no one can completely audit the fed. Anything that has to do with foreign entitys is exempt which makes it basicly a free money washing machine. Also there are positions in the fed which are unauditable.

but what if the usd went up 600 percent the year before and then back down 80.
@_date: 2018-12-29 21:35:35
Thats the hard part. Until they get it sorted they have to trade OTC. This is fine for large trades but kind of a pain for average people. Just have to wait for them to figure things out I guess.
@_date: 2018-12-12 12:41:01
You missed the point entierly. Has nothing to do with financial independence. World banks are far to powerful, especially in a country like ours where the candidate with the largest war chest usually wins. Give me a nations money and I care not who makes its laws.

You can't blame bitcoin that someone makes their email password "Password" and stores their BTC keys there or that some 16 year old makes his first btc wallet in python and distributes it as the "coolest ever" with no idea about real cryptography and security. These are not bitcoins issues.

He should have also noted that as the network slowed skyrocketing transaction fees would take care of the miners. It really is a genius and absolutely beautiful system.

It is a world currency. One of the largest actually. Not sure how you would see it as a pyramid scheme. If people want it then its currency the same as the usd. Currencys were created to make transactions easier than trading cheese for chickens. As software develops for crypto it will be the safest easiest method for conducting transactions of all types including micro.

Yes, but all technological monopolys will eventually be broken. Its gonna happen no matter how hard visa and mastercard might try to grasp on to it. Their rates are honesty just ridiculous.
