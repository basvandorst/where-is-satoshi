Interesting thought - etched wood, or perhaps just a flat wood wallet to hold a paper wallet of sorts?  I dont have a CnC at this point, but it certainly seems intriguing if there is interest for it!  I have access to a very large quantity of more exotic hardwoods that would do a terrific job.

Lots of practice and dedication, as with anything - thanks for.the support!

Thanks for the support!  My son operates a small mining group, so he has helped me get where I am now.  I don't have a physical store, as it is quite costly to do so.  The majority of my work has been custom, and via word of mouth, so this is quite new to me!

Certainly is - My youngest is 20 now, but the crib will be an heirloom for my children for when they have theirs.  One of my favorite projects, and many special memories.

Sorry for the delay - I certainly will!  The boxes are one of my most basic projects (clearly) - I look forward to sharing some more!

Me too - it's what really got me.into the trade!
@_date: 2014-06-06 19:44:23
Sorry about that - try now
@_date: 2014-06-06 17:37:53
Certainly a possibility, although I haven's seen any myself.  I would be interested to see how they did it!

Almost all of my past work.has been custom/artistic.  Generally, a client gives me a set of basic parameters, such as size, preferred wood/color, and I generally get some artistic.freedom.from.there.  Going forward, I would like to be able to have some simpler pieces, such as the boxes, on hand ready to sell, leaving the remainder of my time open.for custom work.  
I'm not 100% sure on the storefront portion - my son is currently putting that together, but I will get back to you for sure.

Sorry for the delay - here is another small sampling

I live in Abbotsford BC, Canada - About an hour outside of Vancouver

Thanks for the support. What about shipping small pieces of art.

Absolutely - You guys will be the first to know ^^

Where are you from?  I have family all over the place

Quite interesting - I -May- be able to do something similar with some more exotic hardwoods I have access to - make art pieces out of them, but I'm thinking I might have another approach to this - I will keep you posted.
