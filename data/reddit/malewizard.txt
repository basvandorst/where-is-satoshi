It is super cool stuff. Theoretically, a quantum computer can try all combinations instantaneously. I sorta have indirect access to a D-Wave machine. We are trying to use it for system optimization, CFD etc. The hard part is tranforming a problem into one the D-Wave machine can solve.

And there are fees. More fees than at Vanguard 0.05% a year for VOO, no transaction fees if you have a vanguard account. Bitcoin is 1% in 1% out for each transaction using Coinbase....

Yeah that isn't even fair, it should be a 30 day average of both..... A totally biased bet. I think the volitility should be incorporated into the risk of the bet.

Trademarks are sector specific I thought like I could trademark gnome for a video game name and it wouldn't infringe on the gnome project trademark.

Pretty much why it was so cheap to sponsor. Some of the more popular games require 10-16 million to sponsor. This one is &lt; 500k

Your source showed defense spending as 14%... US runs a deficit as such you can't say we spend % from income taxes on anything.
You can't just pick and chose the stats you want bro.

Why? So the teacher can ignore her and tend to the slower students? So the bullies and make her feel like a worthless human being?
How much time do children spend just getting in line in a day? How much time is spent actually learning a new thing? All the homeschooling children my wife meets are better behaved than the public school children. Not saying all of them are better, but the majority appear to be.
Did you know most homeschoolers don't even teach alone? They use co-ops and people with specific skills teach different subjects.
Did you know most homeschoolers can participate in public school sports teams?
Why don't you think the OP should homeschool his daughter?

I went there and still have no idea how to buy bitcoins. It's like a secret club.

Would insider trading laws apply to bit coin yet?

This is a actually a cost savings in the long run. Google has given out more for similar work. Cheaper than a consultant would cost over the course of a year I bet.

Same here I think that's average. Especially if you are paying for room and board. Should have lived at home in retrospect.

Agreeded. I personally think 14% is too high.
Edit: Politicians are awesome at generating statistics to support any agenda they have.

Forgot about that.

I would like options contracts to be available.

So what your saying is crappy research and development.

I think more people are mining it. Supply up price down.
