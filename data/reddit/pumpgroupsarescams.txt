“The supply will go down”? Do you mean in the few weeks before the diff adjustment the inflation rate will go down or do you mean the supply of hashpower? If you’ve got millions invested in mining rigs and one government tells you can’t mine anymore, you don’t just throw those machines into the ocean. The miners will relocate and some other government will entice them with very, very cheap electricity.

Well all were mined, obviously, but I’d say the bulk of transactions were people giving away a coin or a few dozen here and there. The sales that determined the value were large quantities, mostly exchanged by western union payment. My first purchase was done by western union payment, and I received the wallet on a thumb drive in the mail a week later. I’m almost positive I paid more for the western union fee than I did for the bitcoin, hence why I’m not retired yet :) 
I have a colleague who purchased a substantial number of coins for an institution (corporate ransomware payoff) and the purchase was made with a briefcase full of cash in a WalMart parking lot. I think coins were already like $30 each at that point, but still a story I love!!

All the people wondering about the recent robberies and you’re asking, “how are people having their bitcoin stolen at gunpoint”? Here’s your answer.
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:55:10
The issue with bitcoin is not high transaction fees; the fees are a symptom of the real issue which is network scalability. Just moving to giant blocks doesn’t solve this problem, it makes it worse. Big blocks means fewer people can host full nodes. Fewer people hosting full nodes means the network decreases in breadth. The network decreasing in breadth means the throughput of the network decreases. There will eventually come a time where current block size is not sufficient, but we are nowhere near that time right now. 
Bitcoin Cash exists because some people are willing to make money at the expense of others. Bitcoin Cash is not a technological advancement and is not superior to bitcoin in any way shape or form. Bitcoin is an unmanned freight train with loosely packed cargo cars in dire need of better container packing. Bitcoin Cash is just a bunch of laughably-giant, but empty cars on a profit-minded train being steered by 4 people and 4 people alone. Like some kind of silly military display or ridiculous fake building thrown together so a dictator can feel powerful. You don’t change major aspects of a protocol because one aspect is being negatively impacted. There are other protocols that are much better suited for the type of profiteering that big blockers have in mind than the bitcoin protocol. If the goal was actually fast, low cost transactions, why bother forking bitcoin? Why not create a coin ground up or take on one of the high throughput coins? The answer is because the only thing they’re concerned about is personal profits. But no matter how gigantic you make the cars on a freight train, at the end of the day it’s still a freight train.

Coin base was subpoenaed for all user to data back to 2013 (I think ‘13) and is currently trying to work a deal where [[potentially-incorrect information removed]]*. But don’t think this is coinbase being Robin Hood, this is Coinbase being reluctant to produce millions upon millions of reports and likely having some closet skeletons involving fractional reserving with small or low volume accounts.

This is sort of like having someone breaking into houses in your neighborhood, stealing cars, and robbing kids of their lunch money and sitting there and thinking, well, maybe it was time to distribute that wealth anyway; and if that’s what right, who am I to question it?
The solutions to bitcoin’s problems will never be centralization around a small group of profiteers. If they wanted a coin designed to reward miners and centralize nodes, why make it anfork of bitcoin? There are plenty of tx-per-block-focused shitcoin cores; why not use one of those? You can’t slap a bigger exhaust pipe, a wing, and chrome rims on your mom’s Minivan and call it a racecar without looking like a real asshole.

Or, maybe, if you’re foolish enough to advertise your wealth you’re foolish enough to have all of your coin stored on wallets in your home. If you think thieves are cool, calm, and calculated geniuses organizing heists in empty warehouses, you need to stop watching so many movies. Nearly all crimes are crimes of convenience.
And, yes, there is a reason the known cryptorich don’t get robbed frequently, because they are smart about their infosec and they have invested substantial amounts of money into that and their physical security.

Crypto is substantially more attractive to a would-be thief than regular instruments of wealth. If a thief steals my credit cards or my car, there are mechanisms in place that almost guarantee he or she will be caught. If a thief steals my Crypto there are mechanisms in place that almost guarantee he or she won’t. Spending money and flaunting a specific store of wealth are very different things. This plate is no different than if someone put “CashMan,” “Diamonds,” or “GoldKing” on their license plate. I’m guessing you have a BTC sticker, shirt, or license plate or something similar and that’s why you’re defensive, but this is just common sense. If one feels the need to advertise his or her wealth and association with crypto, one should really, strongly consider the risk/reward of doing so. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:30:50
Bitcoin is a decentralized community currency. Of course it doesn’t have its shit together; that’s literally the entire point of decentralization. If we wanted something centralized and controlled by a small group of profiteers, we would be discussing traditional, government-backed investment vehicles and inflationary Fiat currencies. 
And you’re absolutely right, it is “no wonder” that Bitcoin Cash™ exists; profiteers have been trying to hostilely co-opt and peculate community-controlled vehicles to divert value from the many to the few since economies first started popping up tens of thousands of years ago. First it was tribalists, then religions, then authoritarian governments, and now it’s corporate ventures like BCH™ seeking to misappropriate community-controlled assets. The difference is, for the first time in human history, this is a vehicle that can’t be stolen without the compliance of the many. Hence the Bitcoin Cash™ team’s utter failure (except in profit-making, which they’ve done extremely well at) and the almost-silly present state of a small handful of people using an army of paid astroturfers to try and solidify the lie that “Bitcoin Cash™ is the real bitcoin.”

It doesn’t take a “PoW cultist” to accept that PoS has unsolved problems. Neither mechanism is anywhere near perfect for achieving all possible goals of crypto. The currencies that embrace multiple means of consensus (multialgo PoW with PoS) or some other non-computational consensus mechanism are on the right track. No one mechanism can be perfect (in a decentralized environment), but many “competing” mechanisms can be a huge step toward a more-perfect crypto.

Being decentralized does not mean being exempt from market conditions. No one issues bitcoin. No one can inflate the supply of bitcoin. No one owns or controls bitcoin. Anyone can contribute to the network in the same capacity as anyone else, without anyone being able to stop anyone else from participating (on a network level). No one can sweep or invalidate your addresses. The exchange value of bitcoin is determined by the market, not by a central issuer or backer.  There are currently about 600,000 funded BTC addresses. So if it’s 1%, that means 6,000 addresses hold those coins.  Most of the richest addresses are exchange cold storage. 1 single address might have 50,000 people’s coins associated with it. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 01:33:22
And there are many, many day traders who are so head-and-shoulders substantially ahead of cold wallet hodlers that they’re in pretty much a different game altogether. Lots of folks got in BTC under $1 and are now sitting quite pretty at nearly 10,000x over 9 years. But there are daytraders (a significant number of them) who are making that on a yearly basis or more frequently without exposing themselves to any more risk than the long term hodler. Yes, hodling is easy and it’s fun to know you’ve hedl for a long time. Even I have a few rather dusty addresses I hope to give to my kids some day. But I really appreciate all of the pile-of-coins-under-the-mattress-for-a-decade guys. You make wildly profitable arbitrage and short-term strategy trading possible for the chart warriors like me!

You can convict on conspiracy once a single guilty act is committed in furtherance of the planned crime. So as long as more than one person come together and discuss committing a crime, once any one of them takes an act in furtherance (driving toward the target, purchasing a weapon, securing a fence for laundering the proceeds, etc.), they have committed conspiracy and conspired to commit a felony. So, because they either hadn’t actually begun a burglary or because not all of the co-conspirators were present for the burglary, but because they had purchased zip ties and duct tape, they will be charged with conspiracy to commit a felony. This crime exists so the cops can arrest and prosecute them before they hurt anybody once there is sufficient evidence they plan to commit a crime. Not every jurisdiction recognizes conspiracy as a separate crime, but in those jurisdictions, you can usually charge someone with an inchoate crime or an attempt crime (which is usually worse for any individual defendant as removing the circle of conspirators from the charge generally removes or reduces the possible benefit of pleading down your own crime by cooperating and selling out your co-defendants).

This same ELI5 has been answered every few months for the past decade, but the general idea is that the value of mining is always be determined by the reward of mining, so as the coinbase goes to 0, the value of transaction fees, alone, will determine the value. This, combined with technological advancements in processing power and the D/A, means the same mining incentives will always be present as difficulty is effectively a calculation of the average cost of finding a block over the average reward of finding a block.

Apple’s revenues and workplace/financial practices are not the core of Apple’s existence. Apple sells products and uses those practices to drive prices and profits. Apple’s revenue pays tens of millions of dollars per month in payroll and overhead. Those things are taxed and regulated. Bitcoin’s whole essence is an affront to traditional government systems. Also, in whose world are major corporations not “targeted”? They spend lots and lots of money to operate in compliance with the law. Apple has hundreds if not thousands of people whose sole job is to ensure compliance with laws in every country where Apple operates. They also have hundreds if not thousands of people whose sole job is to try and have laws adjusted to better suit Apple’s purposes. Bitcoin’s strength is that it doesn’t play within the boundaries of these traditional institutions. You can either enjoy the decentralization, or you can look to a more traditional venture if you want those traditional activities.

“It’s been around longer”. You don’t understand how a fork works. Think of the fork as making two perfect photocopies of a half written novel, and, in doing so, the original is destroyed. You keep writing the original story in both copies (BTC and B2X), but at a predetermined page, you start changing the story in one other copy (B2X). The histories of both chains, or the stories of both books, prior to the forking block are identical because the blocks being created are identical or they will be rejected by both. This fork involves miners creating new blocks that will be rejected by some nodes but accepted by others and any blocks created under original rules will be accepted by old nodes and rejected by new nodes. So after the fork, B2X nodes will have a distinct blockchain from BTC nodes. Neither coin is older, and, in fact, the core software is newer than the S2X software.

I would be more concerned about fees being too low. If you’re sending to yourself or a well-known trading partner and you’ve agreed on a low tx fee, it’s fine. But if you’re actually trading with someone, it’s pretty boggy to send with a low fee.

There is a company that is currently attacking the BTC blockchain. The company is the one that makes and owns the majority of SHA256d mining machines being used on Bitcoin and various forked altcoins (BCH, etc). The attack involves making BTC transactions either go very, very slowly or be very, very expensive. The other half of the attack is creating FUD about how slow the transactions are going (all of this is being done to allow a pump and dump on an altcoin called Bitcoin Cash). This attack starts to unravel in about 6 hours when the difficulty readjusts. Just sit tight!

High Tx fees are a choice. Low fee = longer confirmation time. You can pay the premium for a faster confirmation. There’s no real reason at this point except panic trading to need to send a transaction faster than a couple hours. Payment providers will complete the payment in 10 minutes if it hits the mempool will realistic fees. The “mempool is X transactions deep!!!!” chant is great FUD, especially when paired with an attack on transaction times, but it really doesn’t matter.

The difference is that in reality, the “network” is just a bunch of individuals who are contributing something they individually own (a node, the internet connection that allows anyone to access that node) to public access. “The network” is not some usable but unalienable thing; it’s people contributing something. If the network was centrally controlled and everyone was granted access, that would be common ownership. But the network is not owned by anybody. Each contributor to the network own her own nodes. If I create an internal network with no third parties or if I own all the nodes, it’s not a network. The strength is that independence of each node. I allow you to access my node, but you do not own my node. My node makes up a small part of the network, but I do not own the network.

The example is actually pretty spot on. Once something becomes successful, it generally becomes too big to move nimbly and thus less able to compete. MySpace is the perfect example as it was the biggest, most successful social site in its day, but it couldn’t compete with the newer, prettier, more specialized social networking sites. Amazon was not the first big e-commerce platform, Amazon is the Facebook in the example. Yahoo to Google. Bitcoin doesn’t have to die for a better currency to rise, but I can guarantee that the most adopted currency will not be the one that is concentrated in ownership with up to 90% owned by under 1,000 people. The wealth inequality in Bitcoin, alone, makes it a terrible candidate for mass adoption. There are at least a few dozen people who could each, individually, cause a flash crash or worse. And some of those individuals want exactly that. Jihan Wu has mined over 50% of the Bitcoin in existence. He obviously doesn’t own all of that; but think about it, Bitcoin’s biggest enemy is also its most powerful shareholder.

Coinbase is a great service. This is an industry where behaving like Coinbase is really hard. They provide massive credit (balances before confirmations), they have actual and real customer service (likely just for validated customers), they actively and openly obey laws. I would rather have a slow, expensive service that works extremely well than have a cheap buggy Mt.Gox clone or the “how is it going to go today” experience of Coinbase’s competitors. It’s the classic developer dilemma. Do you move painfully-slowly and listen to the “we want [technological improvement/new version] NOW!” or do you roll things out without major, multi-stage testing and suffer the “why can’t I generate a new address/where are my coins/I sent to this old address but it failed” stuff.

Miners use algorithms that stuff blocks. Smaller fee transactions typically get picked up to fill up a block where there is no larger fee transaction that would fit. Think about filling a hand basket at the liquor store. You can fit six bottles of high-end whisky, and now it’s full, right? Wrong, you can still fit 6 flasks of cheap whisky. But now it’s full, right? Wrong again hot shot! You can still fit a few handfuls of those 1 shot bum bottles. The goal for a miner is to fill the block. It’s a puzzle more than a simple “take the biggest fee transactions until it’s full.” Your tx had a size, weight, and fee that best fit the block they formed.

Market cap is a terrible measure of a cryptocurrency’s value. Value is determined on the margin. An exceedingly small fraction of BTC is actually being traded. For a dubious market cap valuation, pricing of that small fraction is incorrectly being applied across the entire market. If one major holder decided to loosen his or her purse strings and put another 150k coins on the market, the price would plummet, and that new price would still only be based on the handful of percent of coins in circulation. 
Bitcoin is like real estate. No one can make more of it (beyond 20,999,998) , no one can destroy it. We can, however, lock it up and take it off the market. If I buy all 10 houses on my very attractive block and rent out only one of them, I can charge a lot for that one house. If I pretend like that rent applies to all 10, it looks like I have a huge rental income. But if I rent out two of them, the supply is greater and the market pricing will adjust accordingly. Same goes for 3, 5, or 10 of them. People think basic economic principles don’t apply to crypto, but basic economic principles apply to everything. No exceptions.

Day trading is not even close to “pure gambling.” One can certainly gamble by just buying and selling at points where one thinks the market has hit a valley or peak. But what an actual day trader does is nothing like what this sub thinks a day trader does. For starters, day trading is, definitionally, taking a position of shorter duration than a trading day. If this guy is just buying and holding until he’s ready to trade, HE’S NOT DAY TRADING. As most crypto markets are active 24/7, this pretty much just boils down to a 24 hour or shorter position, but, more importantly, we’re only talking about time-based positions. If you are holding a cryptocurrency long term (days or more), you are not day trading. You’re just value speculating. But simply trading bitcoin based on price doth not a day trader make. Also, crypto markets do not have nearly the infrastructure to benefit from actual HF trading systems; trading bots and arbitrage bots that operate in crypto make returns by simultaneously trading pairs on competing markets. 
The vast majority of what the financial world would call “day trading” is taking short-term positions on margin, using hedging strategies. Crypto is volatile; that’s what makes it so attractive to day traders. What day traders understand (and the general pop doesn’t) is that a single position is almost never a safe investment. With the volitility of crypto, I would wager that a “hodl only” investor exposes herself to substantially greater risk than a careful and calculated day trader. If I can open a series of positions that rigorously limit my potential losses while leaving my potential gains unlimited or an order of magnitude larger than my downside, I am not gambling in any sense of the word. I am exploiting calculated risks.
If you’re interested in the concept of day trading, you need to stop thinking in terms of the single asset or a single position. Anyone with rudimentary knowledge of speculative investment mathematics would agree that a risk of loss of 0.5% is well worth an upside potential of 2%. It’s not magic or gambling; it’s just a lot of effort and attention. If I buy positions around a price of $7,600 and the price slides to $7,000, I will have (probably) saturated my downside and lost a known and pre-determined amount of money. An amount I was ok with when I chose my downside and potential. If the price was at $7,600 and instead slides to $4,000, I will have lost that same amount of money as if it slid to $7,000 or $1, because I have protected my downside with hedging techniques. The single position investor (i.e. hodler) is not protected from this volatility by anything but the fact that the asset can’t have a substantial negative valuation. If you want to think in terms of exchange value, the hodler’s downside from a value of $7,600 is $7,600. Yes, she will have 1 BTC until she sells it or trades it, but if she’d sold it or traded it while it was worth $7,600 or 10,000 cheeseburgers or 2,000 gallons of milk as opposed to $4,000, 5,500 cheeseburgers, or 1,100 gallons of milk, you start to understand that the asset is only valued based on other assets or commodities. To a day trader, price, itself, doesn’t matter. Yes, if I bought at $7.50 and hodled to today I would’ve made 1,000x, but my exposure and risk would’ve gone up 1,000x as well. I am exposed to the same percentage risk today as I was a year ago, two years ago, or six years ago. Price doesn’t matter when you’re trading on margin. In fact, risk has tended to go down as price has gone up because there are more sophisticated trading partners and vehicles available.

At its peak, BCH would have needed to hit .85 BTC to make mining BCH remain more profitable. i don’t know what the number is now, but i don’t see anyone having the funds to pump BCH that high or suppress BTC that low.  The last pump was done almost solely on one exchange, and almost solely in fiat. i suppose they could let loose their stores of BTC to try and just sink both ships at once and hope theirs looks better upside down :) but if we’re being real, they don’t want to sell their BTC (hence the attack being done in KRW); getting more BTC has been their long game all along.

The goal was never to actually make BCH the dominant chain. It’s got nowhere near the aggregate difficulty of BTC. The goal was to make everyone ignore BCH and focus on S2X, then when the price ranked, buy up all the BCH over the past few months, then, they announce they killed S2X and start an astroturf campaign that this was a master secret plan all along to make BCH dominant, which ramps the hell out of the BCH exchange value. But where, you ask, are people going to get this BTC killer coin that is going to be the real BTC soon? From the same people running the false flag BCH campaign and the same people who are dumping the hell out of it over the last 24 hours :) 
This whole scam was a long-planned ploy aimed at all the new crypto speculators who feel like they missed out on cheap BTC, but now they had a chance to get in at the basement again! Unfortunately, that basement is full of lies and deceit. The people who swapped their BTC with the BCH squad who were pretending to support BCH have just fallen for the oldest trick in the marketing book. If you want to sell lots of something, tell everyone you’re buying it and holding it, then dump it out the back door to the fools that believed you. This can be compounded with a bear trap on the thing you actually want. 
So if I️ want BTC, and I️ own a truckload of BCH. I️ tell everyone BCH is king and BTC is old crap. Then you’re more than willing to trade your BTC for BCH. I️ just can’t tell anyone it’s me selling the BCH :)

It’s built into PoW coins’ source software that the difficulty adjust every X blocks. For bitcoin, the difficulty adjusts to retarget an average blocktime (this means if the current difficulty remains steady, after the adjustment, a block will be found on average every Y minutes. In practice, this has caused a cycle where miners selectively hash one coin then switch to game the difficulty adjustment. I️.e. making it very easy to mine then committing all resources to mine while it’s easy to win a greater share of blocks). Some coins are moving to a more “dynamic” difficulty adjustment (e.g. BCH) where the difficulty will adjust frequently based on recent hashrate and block intervals, which is designed to make the hashing more manipulable so major mining farms can manipulate it on a daily basis as opposed to a couple times a month.

You’re missing the point. 95+% of SHA256d hashrate in the world is divided between BCC and BCH. When BCH adjusts way up (400+%) in a few hours, BTC will be substantially more profitable to mine, and there will be no major mining resources available for any forks. So the BTC hashrate will rebound. This will make the BTC readjustment come substantially sooner than 20 days.

I would assume it means ~210M of it is not circulating yet. Coinmarketcap takes developers at their word if they identify internal/ organization-controlled addresses and say they are not circulating.

It’s not a “scam,” it’s just a really crappy exchange with a really moronic user base. They don’t delist dead coins, they don’t update wallets, and they constantly release their own nontransferable ERC20 tokens (and they allow the people in the troll box to hype them). So as long as you don’t buy on trollbox hype and you make sure the coin you’re trading is actually on that coin’s mainnet, you’re as safe as you would be on any anonymously-operated exchange. But if your withdrawals fail or you need customer service for anything, don’t hold your breath.

The question is whether or not selling crypto for fiat is taxable as income. In the US, there’s a strong argument for LTCG if the coin was held for 366 days so tax is your LTCG tax. But in many places, the gains on capital appreciation of hedl cryptoassets are not taxed at all. So if you bought in at $10, you pay 0 taxes.

This is something I think most people here are unable to admit to themselves. If you're not willing to lose it, you shouldn't be HODLing it, you should have an exit strategy. "Loss" as you use it means you lose your base trading currency value (probably USD). If your value basis was actually 1 bitcoin/bitcoin, you couldn't "lose" it without losing your seed. But your actual value basis is $X USD/bitcoin (like everyone else on earth who realizes crypto hasn't yet replaced fiat). Create an exit plan for your value basis. If you bought 10 BTC at $100/ea, place a stop limit sell for 2 BTC at $550/ea or 1 BTC at $1,100/ea. Now you've recouped your value basis plus enough to cover ltcg, and you're now on a value basis of 1BTC/BTC. "Hodl, hodl, hodl!!" is great if you're just trying to get other people to hold because you got in at $25/BTC or mined it on stolen electricity 5 years ago. But for anyone who bought BTC as an investment relatively recently and didn't just fall into its value after hobby mining, blind HODLing is no better than burying cash and baseball cards in the back yard.

If you’re not substantially invested, say, arbitrarily, less than 10% of your net worth (or annual income if you carry debt), get a good phone wallet like bread/breadwallet. If you’re more invested than that, look into a paper wallet or hardware wallet. Each of these options merits research, but all share the common thread that protecting your wallet and your backup seed is extremely important. With a BIP38-compatible wallet/seed, you get additional “security” by adding a brain key or passphrase you don’t write down anywhere. There’s a very reputable paper wallet generator that you can find on the web. You can clone it off github, run it on a clean computer (e.g. fresh Raspberry Pi using a Pi-store-bought SD card) and printer, and feel pretty safe if you follow common sense guidelines.

In the financial crisis a decade ago, Sweden (like 90% of major economies) bailed out its banks. The difference with Sweden is that they did it in exchange for equity and voting rights. Swedens’s 114 major banks quickly turned into around 30 within a few years. The entire market is now dominated by 4 major banks, in which the national government has a very difficult-to-calculate and non-transparent ownership share. Though Sweden remains one of the most independent and influence-free press institutions in the world, the nationalization of their banks is something that was barely reported and was practically universally viewed favorably by the population at the time (the terms of the bailout were unanimously supported by all political parties, including the relatively-far-right party that was in power). Sweden has a (mostly well-deserved) tradition of faith in their government, but common sense informs us (perhaps to an extreme extent in this community) that giving governments unbridled control over and access to civilians’ financial power has never ended well in any civilization.

Black hat email client watches emails, looks for bitcoin, banking, credit, gift card, etc. related emails, sets up a filter to redirect “unknown device,” withdrawal confirmation, and successful login emails. Makes their sketchy address a trusted email address and phishes passwords and logins out of you. Zip, zap, zoom you’re broke. When you’re properly phished, you never know it and you blame the service. Remember when your email service detected suspicious activity and you didn’t think too much of it because all the logins were from computers matching your general location and client information? How religious was your friend about password changes, 2FA, and checking URLs?

If you think Dimon's rant is driving this dip, then this subreddit's goal of trying to get people to keep their heads in the sand about BTC valuation is working (new developments affecting BTC in a major way? We'll just shout "hodl" even louder this time!). 
Every Chinese institutional BTC investor is getting out of BTC completely over these two weeks, and the individuals who haven't been able to hide their holdings from PRC gov't are too. That's something like 15% of the market exiting at once (I have no doubt almost all of them will be getting back in once they can find a good workaround, maybe a BTC ETF). It's going to suppress the price as the market just can't support that kind of dump. Then you add in Dimon, panic sellers, arbitrage bots, and just your average daily transactional volume, and you've got yourself an easy 30-50% dip.

Stop using the computer. Do nothing on that drive. You will almost certainly pay more to recover the data than its worth, but you should try shareware software first. If you haven’t used the drive much, you may get lucky. If it’s an apple and/or running trim, pretty much fugettaboutit for $450. (But pull the drive and leave it alone in case that crypto is worth $$$$$ in the future where drive recovery investment becomes worth it).

Again, you are using a different definition for “value producing asset” than Warren (and every school of economic thought). “Value producing asset” does not mean “any asset with some utility or value.” It means the asset produces value/income for the asset holder. Land that can be mined/farmed or built on and rented out or sold is a value producing asset. Land that can only be held and resold for the value of the land, itself, is not a value producing asset. Bitcoin, gold, fiat currency are not value producing assets under any reasonable definition of the term. Neither is email, a screwdriver, or a lightbulb. To be a value producing asset, the asset, itself, must be capable of producing income for the asset holder. An ASIC miner, for example, that earns BTC for the ASIC owner, is a value producing asset, because operating the asset produces income. But merely having utility and functional value is not the same thing as being a value producing asset. Again, you are free to be your own lexicographer and say that “value producing asset,” to you, means an asset with functional value or utility; but you cannot apply your definition to someone else’s statement.

It’s clear you don’t understand the conversation, so I’ll try to simplify it: If you want more people to start using and investing in crypto, you should start thinking about what mass adoption actually looks like, unless, of course, you’re happy with only .5% of the world being users. Aunti mavis and Dave the builder being able to use crypto as easily as credit is what will transform crypto from a bubble to a store of value. If you want a $10,000 BTC (or even maintaining a $5,000 BTC), we need financial buy in and realistic use cases from everyday lay people. Also, since you’re too daft to understand the basics of what we’re talking about, I won’t expect you to understand that I am clearly not talking my own use of crypto. And I won’t read on Mt. Gox; it took me long enough to get my settlement disbursement from them, and I don’t need to dig up those ancient memories.

There are no real economies of scale for crypto mining, it is strictly a function of rig availability, electricity cost, and environmental/space factors. If you have commercial electricity rates, your 1 ASIC earns 1/10,000 of what a major farm’s 10,000 ASICs earn, but your cost is also 1/10,000. If anyone is profiting, anyone can profit because we all have access to the same tech.

If you mean immediately before/after, the following general principles apply: move into BTC before a fork if you’re betting on the lesser chain retaining a decent store of value; after the fork if you’re expecting the lesser chain to devalue quickly. Prior to forks, people move their other assets into BTC, inflating the price. Then, once the chains fork, many of that newly infused value is moved back out of BTC, lowering the price. As there will always be a fork on the horizon, your best bet is to decide what amount of other assets you’re comfortable converting into BTC and then cost averaging your way in, ignoring whatever price movement you or anyone else thinks they can predict.

Not disputing that hardware &gt; mycelium on a phone. But people are lulled into a false sense of security with hardware wallets. Hardware wallets store your keys in a convenient-to-use little device. That’s about it. If you have your backup seeds written down somewhere (and I sure hope everyone with a hw wallet does), your seed is really no different than a paper wallet, except that you don’t have the benefit of BIP38 or other mind key and multi key protections. For cold holding, I trust my etched metal cards substantially more than than my trezor, but when I need to spend or send, I obviously grab the trezor as the metal wallet is one and done.

Mining rewards are proportional to a miner’s hashrate. A GPU will probably pull only a couple satoshi per day, but a top-tier submerged rig farm could be earning 20 BTC per day. There is no real upper limit on what a miner can earn in a day (until difficulty readjusts).

Understand that many users and relatively-late adopters are not technically competent enough to safely manage their own wallet. If we want mass adoption we need to stop this “lol have your own hardware wallet, node, and mining farm or you’re an idiot who deserves to lose everything.” Exchanges bring huge numbers of people into our fold. By merely dismissing them, rather than contributing to a larger conversation on security and uX, you do a disservice to the community at large, and ultimately, yourself as an early adopter.

Bitcoin’s store of value is largely centralized among a small group of people. Read the posts on this sub and you’ll quickly see that 80% of them are dedicated to saying guy x or guy y are trying to destroy bitcoin for their own gain. That’s what people are talking about when they say, “BTC bad; blockchain good.” This sub is focused on evangelizing BTC, so if you stay here it seems like the cryptoworld is peachy, but for the evils of forks. But you shouldn’t kid yourself that the BTC market is heavily manipulated and thus manipulable as it is such a small group (&lt;150 people by some accounts) that own 50+% of the capital in the market.

Really depends what you mean by “mixed” bitcoins. If you mean taking batched transactions and determining which input address sent Tx to an output address, I’d say that would depend largely on the quality of the coin mixer. An advanced mixer/mingler that allowed inputs to be sent in over time and then sent outputs from separate addresses without ever matching the I/O, would be nearly impossible to randomly match, especially if there was an option for retaining change. Say you want to send 1 BTC from address 1A to address 1B, you would send a series of a minimum of 10 pseudorandom amounts to a different address at arbitrary intervals {A_x = (rand() % 10)/100)} where each of these Tx would go to a different address, then a certain percentage of the sum of those addresses would be output from a separate wallet with no on-chain matching ever occurring and the remaining balance would be sent to a change address. The vulnerability here, of course, is the middleman being compromised or cheating you. But no amount of chain analysis could match these ins/outs as far as I’m aware. For “simple” transaction-batching mixers, detecting the paired inputs and outputs wouldn’t be too difficult a task.

The valuations of Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are real figures based on the number of issues shares and an exchange price valuation based on their for-profit corporate purposes and the management teams being legally bound by securities law.

Funny that your comparison to banks and your description of cryptos were literally perfectly backward. A software wallet is like running your own bank, and the key is the key to the vault. Keeping fiat in a bank is literally a direct analogy for keeping crypto on an exchange. My bank has a great vault, and I don’t need to build and use my own for what I’m storing in there. Same goes for crypto. And if you think average people having their own wallet is safer, on balance, than them keeping coins on exchange, you’re dead wrong. The first 10 YouTube videos for how to create your own wallet for any crypto are pretty much always scams. Half the search results when you google bitcoin wallet are scams. For someone who does this as a hobby and who has experience with it, it’s fairly straightforward to keep your coins safe. But for new users, it’s easier to get scammed than not, and if someone loses their initial investment, they will never, ever come back. The only trust and knowledge one needs for a reliable exchange is that they are connected to the legitimate site or service and that the service won’t disappear on them. Only difference between that and a bank is a little bit of unreliable FDIC insurance that won’t matter if a big bank goes under.

I seem to remember the RPi ARM getting about 600 hashes/sec, so I would expect current generation smartphones to be competitive with that. At current difficulty, using the coinwarz calculator, that’s 3.7 satoshi per phone per year of constant operation or .01 satoshi per day. If you infected 100% of iphones (700M active in March according to  for 1 day,  that’s .01BTC. So you don’t need an ASIC to mine effectively; you could also just use the entire world’s supply of iPhones (ignoring that this would absolutely and immediately crash whatever pool’s servers you were using).

Arbitrarily chosen 20,999,999 total BTC to be created in coinbase transactions, and this is dictated and guaranteed by a preset schedule of block rewards based on ranges of blockheights. A future source update could always change the block reward schedule and this the total supply, but without an overhaul of the reward schedule, the total supply is relatively predictable at any given blockheight and time.

“Deflationary” is a term of art in crypto and it doesn’t mean the circulating supply is decreasing. It means 1) supply is scheduled, 2) total supply is limited and can only ever go down, and 3) supply growth is ever decreasing. Mintable cryptos like BTC have scheduled supply by design to encourage adoption and to allow staged market entry. The total supply of BTC is and always has been 21M coins. That’s the supply and it cannot go up. As trading pairs and other currencies inflate, BTC deflates relative to them.

It would be nearly impossible to mine more than 1 or 2% faster than the scheduled growth over the course of a year unless there were constant and consistent technological improvements over that time, which, again, is basically impossible. The price of Bitcoin is determined by the most recent person to purchase bitcoin and the most recent person to sell bitcoin. Stop thinking in terms of price and start thinking in terms of value. The total supply is just shy of 21M and there will never be more than 21M bitcoins. The 21M coins are not all owned as the coinbase transactions assigning them have not been processed.
