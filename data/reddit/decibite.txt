EIG (i.e. Host Gator, Blue Host, Host Monster, and 61 other conglomerates) is the biggest reason we felt things needed to change. They own about 21% of this $11B industry. As result, it's too easy for them to control the rules, esp. since they control the resources too.
Thanks for the feedback! Be sure to sign up on our website to hear when we launch!

If you want a website, somebody is going to do that.
If that ain't your thing, no worries :).
