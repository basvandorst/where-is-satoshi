I got some really good answered here though with some smug ass holes sprinkled in! I appreciate the links my G
@_date: 2019-12-03 22:50:07
damn...those are all good questions too!! (and forsure will come across my mind when i get home and pack a fat bowl)
@_date: 2019-12-04 14:11:51
I have gotten some really solid answers and exactly what I posted for. I was expecting the idiots, but damn you’d think I was a criminal asking for harbor the way some of these folks responded ����

been okay so far and having fun with it, thats for sure. 
You sure people even care when you call "investors" gamblers and it's not your ego thinking that? 
Dont we all (investors) inherently know were gambling, whether it be crypto, real estate, or stocks?

MY favorite answer so far, other answers touched on this but you explained the mining and reward of 12.5....no one wants to go through the work to mine or find the block then overvalue it like an asshole and be rejected by the community. 
Quick question:
are there a certain number of blocks to be mined? or infinite available and a certain amount to be filled for a particular chain...for example, If i mine a block and try to make it worth 100 bitcoin and it gets rejected by nodes, do you then have a chance to remine the same block i mined and mis-priced or do you find/create/mine another available block and price it right thus reserving one of the finite blocks in the chain?  IF it doesnt work anything like this, i wont have my feelings hurt to hear that answer either lol

lol not sure if thats to me or the homie up there but im not trying to be rude, apologies if you were offended
@_date: 2019-12-03 16:36:56
so where are they kept until they are mined? "hidden" and waiting to be found? (for lack of a better term from me)
@_date: 2019-12-04 14:18:36
This took all the explanations a step further and painted a bit more of a clear picture of the mechanics behind mining bitcoin. I appreciate the time you took to post this for me and everyone else who read my question and realized they didn’t know the answer either.
@_date: 2019-12-03 22:28:55
this is probably the best answer I got; it makes sense but brings up a ton of other questions i cant hit you all with

*I sure don't peg my self-worth in what people think of me on the internet, but I also don't ask stupid questions AND call responders assholes for being stumped by a seemingly obtuse stoner.*
\-Why would such simple questions from an obtuse stoner (as posed in my OP) stump you or anyone?
\-I didnt call anyone an asshole for being "stumped", what are you referring to?
\- for someone who doesn't "*peg my self-worth in what people think of me on the internet";* let me quickly remind you of your post just a couple months ago*:*
**Of course perceptions of you matter, how you carry yourself, how you handle yourself are pretty crucial points to consider for a hiring manager.**
What you said stands true not only  for hiring managers but EVERY single person you come into contact with
A couple things to remember on that front:
\-knowing how bitcoin works is great, really but if you cant predict it why would that put you at any statistical advantage to make money over someone who invest with their gut and doesn't know anything about the inner workings? Furthermore why would the assumption of "knowing how it works" give you the feeling you can speak to others who dont understand it the way you do, the way you did here?
\-The internet is like real life, if you were wearing a bitcon shirt at Starbucks and I came up and asked these questions to try to start a conversation and interact in a public forum would you respond in the same manner you did here? If not why do you do it faceless and nameless online?...truth be told I probably wouldn't react how I did here because in many cultures across the world (including mine) disrespect is taken seriously and deciding to call someone out comes with consequences you better be ready for and will have to deal with, on sight.
@_date: 2019-12-03 22:45:46
Oh, i see what you did there..
@_date: 2019-12-03 16:33:28
so the 21M initially created by satoshi are left to be "found" by miners?
@_date: 2019-12-05 18:15:59
Did a quick glance at your comments; you actually seem really intelligent but unbelievably abhorrent and abrasive no matter the thread. Seems a sad existence (maybe even a curse) to be so well spoken but not able to get along. Hope you get the love your childhood was missing here :)

Thank you, I was exploring the possibility of asking a community where  folks who "dont lack the basic understanding" I do could answer in a concise manner.
@_date: 2019-12-03 16:36:15
i didn't get as many "straight" answers other than "yet to be mined"  :( not sure I was asking questions in the right way
@_date: 2019-12-03 22:53:02
Thank you for this explanation, however basic it seems to you it actually really expanded my understanding of what exactly im investing in. I appreciate your time
@_date: 2019-12-04 14:08:52
Lol my man, have you seen your profile? Or nah? My cognitive bias?...
@_date: 2019-12-03 22:30:22
wow...thank you for this. Pretty digestible way for someone with a rudimentary understanding to get this info...thank you
@_date: 2019-12-04 14:19:16
Love this actually. Community aspect threaded in throughout the tech ��������
@_date: 2019-12-03 22:34:15
getting through them now, a couple of them made sense in theory but understanding the nuts and bolts about how they are accounted for at a number of 21M beause satoshi said it was; but about how miners can pay themselves for blocks they "found" is something im still trying to grasp
@_date: 2019-12-03 16:32:37
I say purchase because I've only purchased mine, never mined any...where are they kept until they are mined, and who maintains that holding account?
@_date: 2019-12-03 22:41:29
Thats pretty rad actually; is there a scavenger hunt going on to find blocks or is it basically a game of "fastest computer finds and mines"
