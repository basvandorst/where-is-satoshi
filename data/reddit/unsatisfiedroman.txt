Old news. Isn't even relevant today.
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:17:48
This makes absolutely no sense.

I read it, it's not enough to significantly move the market.

Don't you think the amount of bitcoin represented is pretty damn important when your argument is based around the scarcity of supply? I feel like your post is very misleading. 
edit: When you say "80% of bitcoin" in unique addresses. That means 80% of the bitcoin in all addresses so that would be 80% of BTC's market cap. I think you meant to say 80% of unique addresses cannot move their bitcoin.

Do you even know what that amount is? I'm sure it isn't enough of bitcoins market cap to lower demand. There are a number of unique addresses used by businesses for things like satoshi dice, etc.

What are you even trying to convey when you say "Around 80% of bitcoin in unique addresses couldn't move". 80% of what? All bitcoin in circulation?

Go check the github. The road map and a lot of other useful information is hosted there.

Do you have more than me too? What a piece of work, comparing bags that you can't even see. You sir are a loser and probably haven't made any money in crypto.

I lived it in real time too. While gold did experience a liquidity trap in 2008 it didn't last all year and certainly not into 2009. The data is correct. Here is a more granulated chart.

They are all over other big cities too

What are you talking about? Gold skyrocketed in 08/09

Fiat is government backed money. Dumping is like selling because you think its worthless/overvalued

Yes, it would certainly make sense if you have the capital for profitable rigs.
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:21:19
Very doubtful

Very elegant explanations in this thread, I'm glad you are around to explain this.

Not everyone has this issue teaching math. Stop concern trolling.
