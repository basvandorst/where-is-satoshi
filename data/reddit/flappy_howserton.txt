Bitcoin can be borrowed like any other thing or currency.

I was considering the merchant's point of view.
It's not costless for a merchant to secure, count, re-count, and deposit cash. If you're a store, you have to count cash at the beginning of the day before it goes into the register and at the end of the day when it comes out of the register. If you've got multiple registers, you have to do that multiple times. (And if you're a real stickler, every employee will have their own money box.) And then you have to combine, strap, roll, etc. and send it to the bank. It's simple stuff, but it takes real human time. This is not a concern with Bitcoin or credit cards.
Credit card theft is a problem, and it imposes costs on the system as a whole, but ordinarily merchants do not bear the direct cost of someone using a stolen credit card. (This changed somewhat with the chip-and-signature regime in Oct. 2015, but it's a simple fix for merchants to avoid liability.) But your argument really isn't even unique to credit cards; cash and Bitcoin can also be stolen. And while we're on the topic--wouldn't you rather have your credit card stolen (and fraudulent charges rang up on your account), rather than your cash or bitcoin stolen? At least you have statutory protection from any liability for credit cards used fraudulently in your name. If you lose your cash or bitcoins, you'll almost never see those again.
"Slicing and deciding spending habits should be even better with bitcoin" -- but it's not right now, and it may never be. Credit card companies require merchants to use particular codes depending on what type of merchant they are and what type of purchase it is. That's what makes slicing and dicing credit card data effective. Who's going to impose that obligation on merchants using the blockchain? Nobody.
If your objection to using Mint.com is "oh no hackers might getcha" you might just want to turn your computer off right now.

The effect is the same though. Whether Coinbase charges you 1% to convert consumer-spent bitcoins into cash in your bank account or Visa charges 2% to convert consumer-spent dollars into cash in your bank account, you're taking a haircut either way. Coinbase's 1% may be more attractive right now, but overhead is overhead.

I guess Bitcoin solves this problem because Bitcoin isn't Jigglies.

So as long as the credit card loan is denominated in a made-up currency called "jigglies" instead of dollars, and I pay someone 50 jigglies, i'm only creating an indirect tax on those people storing value in jigglies and not in dollars?

* For the most part, people who pay cash pay the same as those of us with credit cards.
* Get a card with 1% cash back, and you'll do better than those who pay in cash.
* Pay off your balance every month and you won't pay any interest charges. You'll come out ahead because you're getting a free loan for up to 45 days.
* With a credit card, you never have to go to the bank to get cash.
* Your credit card gets stolen, you cancel it and you have no out-of-pocket loss. You lose your cash...
* Handling cash isn't free either. It must be secured, counted, re-counted, and deposited.
* Bitcoin has transaction fees, too.
* Credit cards provide some purchase protection if a merchant tries to rip you off. Try that with cash or Bitcoin...
* Online credit card bills let you effortlessly slice and dice your spending habits. ("How much did I spend at restaurants last year?")
I'm not a shill for the credit card industry, but there are a lot of benefits that come out of that ~2% transaction fee.

They were jigglies.
