Where do I find this GDAX? I can't find an app for it.

What does HODL stand for? Been seeing it everywhere.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:21:46
Been wondering the same. Same for social too. But I have made purchases on both BC and Litecoin and don't see a balance in my account. It must be because I haven't uploaded my ID right?
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:10:43
Yes. I've been monitoring closely past week and it seems 14-15k is a safe buy. Don't see it dipping that low again now that it's climbed back to 17 though
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:25:46
Can I get an explanation on how to sell my Bitcoin for real cash? I don't know if I've downloaded a platform to do it yet. Or really even where to start. 
Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:40:00
When we get drops to 15k would you say that's a good price point to buy at? I don't see it dropping really much lower than that does anyone else?

How much of a percentage do you think Satoshi's original addresses are taking up? I suppose making it more broad and ranging back to addresses &gt;$100,000 USD - puts us at 200,000 addresses owning &gt;$100,000 USD - compared to 18.5 MILLION owning basically nothing. I'm part of the nothing so far so I'm just trying to develop a strategy to make a few hundred for myself. Any ideas? Thanks!

Is this sarcasm? Sell low? Buy high?
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:37:22
Here we go!
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:22:00
I downloaded Gemini. Linked my bank account. Signed up. Etc etc. If I want to buy bitcoin at the smaller value we've discussed, is this Coinbase app all I'll need?
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:25:50
Thoughts on Ether?
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:28:19
I purchased both Litecoin and BC through Coinbase last week. Money has been withdrawn from my bank account, and I've verified my identity and did everything necessary to set up my account. So my question is when in the world am I going to see my money in my wallet? If I wanted to sell today I wouldn't be able to. Not saying I necessarily want to, but when will my money be available? Let's say Litecoin dips hard in the next couple days - I just have to deal with whatever happens and wait it out? My purchases have been "pending" for a week now. Anyone else have this issue before?

What is Bitfenix? There's so many different places to buy this - transfer that - sell this - trade that. It gets confusing for someone like me who just started reading into this 2 days ago. Can I transfer my BC from Coinbase to Bitfenix and use my BC to buy IOTA?
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:48:22
I bought last night around 6pm and mine still hasn't processed in my wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:50:13
I bought $100 worth last night and mine is still processing this morning. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:09:10
So are Bitfenix and Ethereum blockchains? I don't completely understand the blockchain process but for now it is what it is - a blockchain
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:25:09
Any advice for a beginner?
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:26:12
This is my first day with BC. I'm really just trying to wrap my head around this whole thing. 
Can you buy actual goods with BC? Is it accepted in stores anywhere?
It seems to be an investment and that's all I see for conversation. I bought at 11k - 2 hours later at 13k!!!
--- Is that 11k aforementioned $11,000 USD? Or is it 11,000 BC??? I also see I bought $100 worth of BC. What does that $100 represent? I'd love to get involved, I just really need to do more research. Hopefully I can get some advice here. 
Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:52:13
I'm new. Should I be using GDAX instead of Coinebase? Or are the 2 used simultaneously for transferring like you mentioned above?
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:34:14
Can you please explain to me how to sell my bitcoin? Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:43:52
I'm currently involved just as a hobby. Gives me something to follow and as there's an increasing hype surrounding BC it will be fun to monitor. I don't plan on using it as a form of currency at the moment, I'm here for profit. But I can see the benefits of it being used as currency in the future. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:13:21
$12,800 USD???? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:07:44
I am currently using Coinbase for my BC and Litecoin buys. I have yet to upload my ID to the app, and although I've purchased share in both, it still isn't showing that I have money in my wallets. I have BC that I want to sell ASAP. Like tonight. Can anyone tell me if the app will look and act differently once I upload my ID info? Any advice on cashing out will be greatly appreciated and helpful. Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:57:50
Korea sucks
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:32:05
Are we expecting the price of BC to go up or down after this weekend?
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:08:58
Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:27:40
Thank you. Am I able to withdraw directly into my checking account from GDAX? Or does this need to be "sold" on some exchange? Or is GDAX an exchange lol! Thanks for the help
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:04:43
How much does 1 BC cost USD right this minute? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:33:45
Just an observation here: 2400 addresses own &gt;$10,000,000 USD. 18.5 MILLION own $1-99 USD. I don't see the future of Bitcoin to be profitable for buyers like myself who are only spending $100-$1000 in the current market. The top 1.5% aforementioned will dump and we will lose. They will profit BIG. We will continue to chase the high but I'm not sure if it's possible. Any other thoughts? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:52:08
Any other favorite cryptocurrency that you see becoming popular over the course of the next few years?
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:56:46
Buying in the 15's seems like a safe bet for now. I bought in the 17's last night expecting to see 19-20's today. But if it gets to the mid-low 15's today I'll definitely buy. No doubt about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:24:39
Thank you

What is the plan for the futures on the 10th and 18th? What kind of impact are we going to see from whatever happens on those dates?
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:22:18
Either a spike or a drop. Nothing in between
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:18:02
The Bitfenix website doesn't even make any sense. I feel like I'm not even on the correct website. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:20:35
It's very simple. Can only trade BC Litecoin and Etherium though. I haven't figured out how to sell my shit yet though which is really bothering me because I want to sell
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:22:17
I bought LC today and it isn't arriving for 7 days. Bought BC yesterday isn't arriving until 12/14. So these funds are accessible until then? So we basically have to sit on whatever we bought until then?
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:27:15
When it comes time to sell and withdraw - can I get an explanation on that process? Is it simple?
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:19:29
Is that essentially like buying penny stocks?
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:49:51
Great question. Anyone have any answers?
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:14:48
What I'm wondering is why I can't buy IOTA on my Coinbase app. I have both Bitcoin and Litecoin through my Coinbase but I can't search for like "IOTA" and buy it on there. So do I need to buy it from Bitfenix? I just don't want to keep installing new apps every 10 minutes. Trying to make this as simple as possible. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:49:04
Also, is a 1% charge high? I'm using Coinbase for my trades. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:58:23
I made my first purchase last night. I'm using Coinbase for my transactions. I've seen this asked a few times, but can someone explain the process of converting my BC to real money and when I want to sell - how do I go about doing it?
Also - would anyone suggest using a different application or is Coinbase fine?
Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:20:00
Are you able to transfer your balance from Coinbase to GDAX?
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:16:57
So is there any way to get involved spending only $1-200? Can I get a Satoshi of a BC? If that doesn't make sense basically what I'm asking is am I able to purchase a fraction of a bitcoin? I don't have $12k at the moment. 
Thanks guys
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:13:15
I have the same exact question. I don't understand how to cash out using Litecoin
