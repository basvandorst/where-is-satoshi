Commerce in bitcoin is increasing, but most transactions ultimately result in sale of the bitcoin for fiat. Buy/sell imbalance puts downward pressure on the price, as does the addition of new coins every single day. That downward pressure will ease up when more merchants start holding the BTC and spending it as bitcoin in the B2B environment.

Get moar people using the symbol. The consortium will not want to take up space for a glyph that may disappear in six months.  Currency symbols are national economic status symbols, and it's a growing area in typography.

Regardless, all of the alts can be compared to the Dvorak keyboard. Dvorak is objectively, quantifiably better than the QWERTY keyboard, but not so much so to justify switching over on a mass basis. None of the competing international auxiliary languages have been shown to be that much better to supplant Esperanto in that space. Metric is not considered enough of an improvement for Americans to embrace it. 
Even Litecoin is unnecessary. It is where it's at because of timing, and because its non-threatening PR compliments Bitcoin and assumes a position subordinate to it ("silver  to Bitcoin's gold")

On the other hand, you come off as an ungrateful beneficiary of a system that uses coercion to take resources from other families to feed you. In a world where liberty is treasured, those charitable functions would be handled by volunteers (who, being taxed less, would be more able to contribute). In the past, this function was taken up mainly by the Church.

Double spending is a bit of a misnomer because what really happens is a second transaction overrides the first. A victim of a double spend would see their transaction essentially vaporize after having handed over the merchandise. For things like mail orders and car purchases, the seller can simply wait for a few confirmations to know that the transaction is done, but if it's a sandwich shop, they'll probably just risk it.

To burn bitcoin is to send it to a provably irretrievable public key i.e., one that's clearly made up and nobody has the private key for. I am guessing this is done so that the Bitcoin associated with the marriage decree hash is never spent, and thus won't ever be pruned if the blockchain ever comes to that.

I think they can co-exist, but Invictus has the jump right now. Invictus is plowing ahead with revenue-producing features one after another, and Ethereum is rethinking the blockchain from the ground up. There is talk in bitcoin of multiple blockchains, with off-main-blockchains in different environments. Invictus seems to be more immune to bloat if the functions are split up. Ethereum on the other hand introduces a new standard, and a new platform which has the potential for interesting and innovative apps.

Bitcoin 2014 is like the internet of 1994, not 1970.

(Referenced even in the Beastie Boys song "Do It" BTW) But the parallels are astounding; Andreas always references the internet. I'd expect to see slow but accelerating growth over the next three or four years and then a complete vertical takeoff, in terms of adoption.

I put quotes around "intrinsic value" because in Schiff's world, that means other non-monetary uses. In actuality, value means just that, a subjective belief as to its worth- really a community-wide intersubjective belief as to its worth. The worth of Bitcoin is strictly monetary. You can't take them out of the supply and smelt them down to make jewelry. Non-monetary gold would not be just as valuable if it is only a fashion accessory. At best it is a consolation prize if gold fails as money.

Commodity prices are flailing across the board, and Bitcoin is not immune. Money is going into stocks, not the Bitcoin economy (or metals, oil etc.) As long as that stays the case, BTC will slide gently and will test the mid 200s, if not lower. If something funny happens with the USD, BTC will benefit and potentially massively. The days of Bitcoin getting price boosts just on the announcement of a new merchant or on coverage in the news are over. The investor class knows about Bitcoin, they don't think it wise to move in in the present environment.

I say nonevent. In the months leading up, the miners will probably hold back until the expected rally happens, and the price will gradually float up. Then the halvening happens, and the price will probably suffer because there will be a lot of those withheld coins coming to market all at once, but after that the price will recover. Whatever the price impact is, it won't happen all at once at the moment of the halvening.

Schiff is a very intelligent commentator, but he does not have me convinced on "intrinsic value." If a commodity has greater "intrinsic value," the more likely it is to be diverted from monetary use (melted down), reducing its utility as money. Silver is more valuable than gold for industrial purposes, so gold becomes the better store of value. If you could have a commodity that had exactly *no* industrial uses (no possibility of diversion), and possessed all the other qualities of money (fungibility, scarcity etc), wouldn't that be ideal? That's cryptocurrency.

Isn't there a way to sweep the private key to a hot wallet so it could be spent or sent from there to a paper wallet right away? The bitcoins are there on the blockchain, it's just that the blockchain isn't completely on your client yet.

This is why I think anonymous cryptos are gaining traction- the point of Monero or Darkcoin (soon to be renamed DASH) is that the coin's history does not come with the coins. Monero accomplishes this through ring signatures, Darkcoin/DASH through mixing. Neither is 100%, but they come very close.

Blacklisting stolen coins would harm fungibility, reducing bitcoin's utility as currency. That type of censorship in the fiat system is a key reason bitcoin is attractive as a currency.

If Scenario A were to play out (the value goes astro), then it is because bitcoin has become widely accepted and in all likelihood you will be spending it as bitcoin, and not caring about the USD anymore. The other scenario is value to zero, and there is nothing in between.

I wouldn't expect immediate market reaction because of this. Anyone who is deep into bitcoin is unlikely to come to some kind of epiphany and panic sell, and anyone not in the game already will at worst not get in, or learn that it isn't a scam and decide maybe they could actually get in.

It think the cable companies will go for a more on-demand/a la carte system of viewing in exchange for micro payments. Not only will they make more money, but it will lower entry barriers for producers. It would out the Ultimate Frisbee League on equal footing with the NFL.

Andreas is a great representative for bitcoin, Keiser not quite so much. Max can't have a conversation about anything without comparing central bankers to decaying flesh or dung. Andreas is able to convincingly describe bitcoin as a force for actual social justice - giving the poorest people in the world access to financial services and markets.

The intrinsic value argument is such a sideshow. Bitcoin can be a "currency" without being "money," but apart from that, it does have intrinsic value - value being subjective, and information having value, the intrinsic value of bitcoin is the cryptography itself.

The price is really irrelevant. The price will float up to whatever price is necessary so that bitcoin is a useable payment system. If lots of people want to use bitcoin to transfer large sums of money, the price will have to be high in order to price in the value of the transactions. The amount of bitcoin in circulation represents the value of all goods and services in the bitcoin economy, so come up with a number you think that is going to be and divide by 21 million. (Or however many Bitcoins there are at the time)

Bitcoin's main advantage is that it it several years ahead and far more established that the altcryptos. Pricing things in millibits (there is even a symbol, ₥, for this) is very feasible and people would get used to it, just in time for the switch to microbits.
