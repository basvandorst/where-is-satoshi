Nope sure didn't, I've been in the process of trying to recover some btc when my wallet didn't magically sync with the server and lost .22 btc.
So I found it strange that I received that email and then read the news about this. Seeing how I hadn't touched that wallet in almost a week.

On it already, hopefully they can help me out. I've sent coin to my wallet so many times with diff addresses and never expected something like this to happen.
Also I've been working on migrating to bitcoind on a raspberry pi, I'm just waiting on a 128gb usb to show up so I can migrate all the blockchain over and have my wallet and send my older mining minions over for the lottery. Then only use online wallets like blockchain for smaller on the go things out there.

So I unarchived some addresses earlier only to find this as my final balance.. as you can see i should maybe only have around .2btc but as we can see thats not whats showing. Any ideas on this? I checked blockchain mobile app as well, shows the same thing. Also I checked all addresses and they all check out as to what they show here as well.

I submitted a ticket last night and have since been in contact with someone regarding this issue. Thanks for the response though! Hopefully I can get this resolved. =D

I got this message as well, but it was for an address I created almost 4-5 days ago. Funny thing I had archived the address not to long after I got the message, and just not got two emails saying I sent btc from the address. Luckily though (I guess) they only got about 10¢.

Awesome, I hope its a bug, but at the same time would be pretty nice to have a few extra btc like that lol. Thanks for the info!

Indeed it is, moving to lower power cost boards like the RPi and a cubieboard as well, so it's pretty much a double win for me. Instead of either always having to update when the main pc is on, or always having it on to stay up to date.

Awesome, it's in work now. Just getting it ready now.

No, it the balance showing on blockchain.info.
And it doesn't tell me anything either. It says I have 2 btc when in reality I have ~.2 btc
Im not showing the address for personal reasons for now if thats what your wondering.

I guess I don't really need to do it. However, I like spreading the word about it. I enjoy talking about various aspects of Bitcoin, even though it may or may not catch on to an everyday player in terms of currency, I figure the more support it has the better.

Yes I was scammed, I realize that. I had posted it to show that while yes I got a swindled, there is a system in place to help rectify the situation. 
Instead of me saying oh no look i got robbed. I should have said "hey look I got scammed with my internet money, but no worries, there is a system in place so I don't lose faith/interest in Bitcoin" instead.
Sorry I should have clarified that when I originally posted this. 
@_date: 2015-03-21 04:52:03
Yes I did. It was a mistake that I made. I can actually do that with any different currency though.
I've known these guys for a while and some people just don't budge on their stances. It makes it bad for anything not just Bitcoin for wanting to spread new ideas to the masses when you know, or now know, that these are the guys in my job that have positions of authority.

No I just suck at making little screen shot things. Sorry if you think its fake..
@_date: 2015-03-21 07:52:57
Your right, I guess I had the wrong approach. I reckon people would see it as something that was meant to fail since I posted something along the lines of getting scammed. I was merely trying to convey that while yes like many things it can be shady, but at the same time you can still be protected in a sense.
@_date: 2015-03-21 04:31:33
So a little back story. Made a poor investment, guy didnt pay up, got excited and sent a screen shot to FB, then got into this little conversation.
I'm not very good at explaining all the time. Besides throwing out the bitcoin wiki page to people and rambling, what are some good options on really talking to people who think Bitcoin is "magical unicorn monopoly money??
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:29:04
Im in the same boat. except i have a magic 291BTC in my account. just for good measure i put in for a withdrawl of 1BTC lol
