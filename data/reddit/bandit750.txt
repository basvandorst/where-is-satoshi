I will dig deeper and see if I am fully verified

I have a coinbase account and I am verified. When I try to setup gdax it tells me I need more verifications. Is this normal

This was my first big rollercoaster ride and i was reading both r/bitcoin and r/btc and i was not sure wtf was going to happen. So i cashed out at a gain. To wake up today to buy in almost $1000 cad higher. 
This is really something you cannot let emotions get in the way.

That was always the plan. I was just stating I got no choice but to hodl

I was at coin base website the other night ready to sign up and decided to search reviews and boy were there some unhappy people lol. I may give it a try since I just want to buy and hold. Most of the issues seem to come from people spending their btc in places they deemed bad.

Here is a thing to know for the new guys that I am going through  right now. Someone brought it up to my attention. If you live in canada you cannot sell your bitcoin on coinbase.
It's really awesome........

So as a new user to bitcoin and this world. What would of been his best choice to store his bitcoin? I'm currently trying to navigate through these waters. Would a wallet on a pc have prevented this or should you just go straight to a hardware wallet?
I'm not invested to the point where a hardware wallet seems needed but I am cautious about my options due to limited knowledge

I've bought 3 times in my life and I has never gone up past the price I purchased at yet.
Got not choice but to hodl...
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:44:28
I feel ya, I made my first purchase on sept 4th lol......
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:40:06
Cost me 2.23$ cdn to send transactions yesterday. 
I'm still working my way through this world so I spent  2.23$ to send 2$ to another exchange lmao. Sometime you got to play to figure things out
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:41:32
What's the easiest way to get into buying? I've been following and procrastinating buying since 1800$ cause I'm not sure the simplest way to start
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:33:52
That's how I slept last night knowing the last two Fridays the price went up....... so far I slept alittle to peaceful for the days returns
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:43:19
Well, the way I look at it is your spent 4$ to see how it works. 
Imagine if you did it wrong and all your btc were gone.  4$ would seem like a small lose then would t it

Is there any financial benefit to running a full node?
Besides helping the community grow and increase price.
@_date: 2017-10-07 01:20:51
I am new too this whole thing. Can someone dumb this down for me? I currently have my coins stored on coinbase because I feel it's not a big enough sum to buy a hard wallet yet. What should  I expect? I have no plans to sell coins on the near future.
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:31:43
No guru here but I believe when the fork happens you still receive the coins ounces you make a transaction. 
One advantage is that you will have instant control of your coins vs waiting for coinbase to give you access and I read that could be January.
Please feel free to correct me if I am wrong cause I am still learning all this as well
@_date: 2017-10-07 12:12:23
A hard wallet doesn't seem to technical from the videos I have reviewed. I just don't have a significant value of bitcoin to bother buying one. I'm still looking for a good Canadian buying platform. Coinbase is ok but you cannot sell if you are Canadian
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:37:07
I have not sold, but it's there
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:30:10
Also from canada and there is a sell on my coinbase mobile app
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:44:36
I worry about the same thing.my fear of those companies mishandling my info has cost me a lot of money lol
I'm not sure what identity theft could be stolen from a utility bill though
@_date: 2017-10-07 11:53:10
Any recommendations for iPhones?
@_date: 2017-10-07 11:53:59
If I take my coins off coinbase and the hard fork happens, will I still end up with coins on books chains?
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:38:19
Bare with me I am new to the whole scene.
Have your own node would be a perk to the user because it is a increased form of security that I read about. Helps prevent people possibly stealing coins.
But is there any financial gain from helping the system.
Miners get money per transaction, do you see anything from having a node.
Do you save any on transaction fees by having a node?
