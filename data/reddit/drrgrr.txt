I was there a couple months in 2012.
"Yes, worst country in the world. USA nr. 1." - Every Iranian taxi driver when discussing the country.
Absolutely lovely people though. Never have I felt as welcomed as a tourist as in Iran.

Back to where we were just a week ago. Hoping for a real dip to 4000 to Invest more before take of.
@_date: 2019-04-10 08:32:31
200k within 3 years, drop to 20k and then 1 million within another 4. I base this on nothing.
@_date: 2019-04-21 16:20:36
Instructions unclear bought BSV.

They do so in Norway. That's why they are not allowed in the EU.
@_date: 2019-01-23 14:40:54

Moving average over different time periods. It shows the direction that the price has been moving calculated over a longer time period (like 50 days, 200days etc). If my explanation is as bad as I think, just Google moving average.

Bitfinex premium is back. I don't get it.

If he had one he wouldnt need $50 for silk road.
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:20:48
Back in?
@_date: 2019-05-23 05:01:19
It's &lt;$80 now. If you don't need it to survive just hold it. In a couple years it could be $500. Hold more. In 10-20 years it could be a few thousand.
@_date: 2019-05-23 07:35:30
It was a 5% dip..
@_date: 2019-05-29 09:07:09

@_date: 2019-05-27 09:12:17
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:31:25
Best of luck! :) If it hasn't dropped by then, DCA in or whats your plan?
@_date: 2019-05-02 09:52:46
This has been said many times before. Could be true this time but doesnt have to be.
@_date: 2019-05-29 07:00:45
40% retrace is quite normal isnt it?
@_date: 2019-05-29 07:07:41
\+15$ last minut. Bull run confirmed!
@_date: 2019-05-29 14:07:33
Are you financial advisor?
@_date: 2019-05-27 09:20:10
Here we are at the start of a fresh bull market, 10% up just yesterday, and you are grumpy. Who hurt you Boo?
@_date: 2019-05-23 09:28:52
Yea I'm not being very clear in what I'm saying. I just see alot of FUD all around about the price drop of today. Thought you ment that the drop of today was a sign of red wedding incoming. I think we have to just strap in and not look to deep in too the crystal ball.
@_date: 2019-05-23 11:22:58
Just know that it could also end up at 0. High risk, high reward, wild ride.
