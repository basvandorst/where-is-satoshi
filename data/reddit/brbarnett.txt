are they directly transacted/deposited into a bank account or something?  what makes it "exact?"

So I'm not as much worried about the transaction volatility, but rather what happens to the payment sum once it's in your business account. If someone gives me 1 BTC and the exchange rate against the dollar falls 10% the next day, aren't I down 10% on that transaction?

As great as it is that we're all making a little money, it's comments like this that make BTC a horrible decision for businesses to use it.  Big gains pair with big losses now and then, and are characteristic of an extremely volatile financial instrument.  Until it actually becomes somewhat stable, BTC will never truly go big.  I love it, but it'd be nice to be able to trust its value when accepting for services/products.

saying Bitpay doesn't make you right.  any other genius theories?

Also consider that you might not target this to the consumer market (where you'd have to worry about pricing a bit more), but perhaps retail.  Once more retail stores start accepting BTC (which they inevitably will),  don't you think they'd buy a larger QR slab like this to put near their registers?  How cool would that be?

To be honest, I'd like to refer to it as only BTC as well, but the fact is that it's too highly volatile right now.  For example, I'd feel uncomfortable listing goods on a merchant site in BTC, knowing that the payment I'd receive would vary so highly day-to-day.  BTC traded at ~$970 last night, but overnight dipped to ~$800 at one point.  That's an 18% drop.  Would you be willing to take that for your products or services?
