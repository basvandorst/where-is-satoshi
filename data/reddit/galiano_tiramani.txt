The server is in charge of running the electrum software and generating your balance as I understand it, I use linode.com, I had someone develop this app for me.

Sorry about the ads! I was under that impression about HD being standardized too but apparently they are totally different... am I correct about this?

I apologize if this is old news but I have not yet heard about it and would love some more info on it. I am under the impression this was a localbitcoins seller.

Pantera tipped me also, this inspired me to make it rain over facebook with the tip anywhere feature... only 5 out of the 40 tips I sent were collected so far.... 1$-2$ each... guess people dont like free money...

Good job schooling them CC!

this is because the price is low so more coins are being sold. The demand should be shown in USD, like this...

I love Andreas, but im pretty sure you cant send bitcoin on the north pole without internet

I love Electrum but couldnt find a solution for easy viewing of my balance on my phone so I had this app created. If you guys like it I can add support for trezor MPK and other HD wallets...
Hopefully the ads can pay for the server ;)
Enjoy guys, id love to hear any feedback!
@_date: 2014-12-03 03:31:26
so is that what this guy is accused of doing?

Fiat money is infinite
@_date: 2014-12-02 22:53:29

@_date: 2014-12-05 03:19:42
I did it for android 
@_date: 2014-11-21 04:30:42
can you send me the mpk so I can try to reproduce the issue? or even send me a video of what happens to tiramani
@_date: 2014-11-20 22:43:14
I created this just for you :)
@_date: 2014-11-21 04:08:07
tapping on the balance should allow you to view the receiving addresses, what happens if you do that?
@_date: 2014-12-02 22:56:07
I love the forfeiture section
@_date: 2014-11-20 23:39:10
Check out my electrum app
@_date: 2014-12-10 17:20:48
Really need to know the full story here... not having much luck with google...
@_date: 2014-12-02 23:12:51
i have heard about the pirateat40 ponzi but how are these related?
@_date: 2014-11-20 22:54:58
@_date: 2014-12-03 03:31:38
im surprised no one cares about this
@_date: 2014-12-10 17:39:49
seems like these news outlets are not giving us the full story
@_date: 2014-11-21 04:07:05
if you tap on the balance then tap on the address it give you a qr code and an option to copy the address

Localbitcoins can be a bit slow and frustrating sometimes but has always been TRUSTWORTHY. Since 2014 have entrusted A LOT of bitcoins and money with their site. We have had many disputes but I never once lost money to an unfair ruling. I think they just have growing pains and limited support staff.... if you want to message me on the site I can give you some pointers.. [
