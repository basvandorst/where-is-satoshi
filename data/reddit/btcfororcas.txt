I donated. I've watched hours of Andreas and never gave anything back for it. He's been my calm during the storm over the last six months. And the best part is - we all know this money will do nothing to his passion, or what he chooses to do next week. It'll only allow him to focus even more. Thanks for everything AA. You're in it for all the right reasons.

use Bitwallet if you're iOS and like me, were tired of waiting for Bread to support it
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:46:19
what is the original ?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:25:56
I don't know if a good trick. I'd spent the BTC I had in Bread but rather than sending more to Bread from my Ledger (where I'm on SegWit) I opted to download bitwallet instead. It's the first non-Bread wallet I've used so don't have much else to offer in terms of user experience

orcas need BTC too

this is a good example of bitcoin avoiding centralization with regards to decision-making over code updates, but what are your thoughts on ‘whales’ in the space and centralization of coins/ability to manipulate price?

how much is that date capable of moving? In other words, is that date +/- 10 days? 1 month? 3 months? Is there a site or something I can follow to know what a current projection is?

get two hardware wallets, then set up a (free) multi-sig vault with Unchained Capital as a third signer. It takes at least two signatures of three to move the funds. Still your keys, still your coin, but if one of your wallets/seeds is compromised, you can send a quick video to Unchained requesting they sign a transaction with you with their third key and your remaining one to move the funds to a new account. 
The video is for them to confirm it’s truly you and you’re not under duress - you send them a video of you reading a script when setting up the account. (though that step is also optional)

it feels like the kids card game ‘spoons’. People are passing cards and trying to make a hand (still technically working in fiat, business as usual), but everyone’s attention is on the spoons (BTC) in the middle. The moment someone grabs a spoon, everyone will forget what cards they had and dive for a spoon.

Do you have any that could fit an orca?

watched it live! (live in the NL) 
very positive, but focused mostly on the financial success, almost nothing on he technology. The family was a good role model though. Said they've spent more quality time together from downsizing lifestyle, they're hodling, and that it's just money. Said if they lose everything, they still have each other.
Plus for those lovers of "the Euro game", staring down the barrel of a mean Euro-Lewis Black on the panel, and the dad is a serious Euro-John Travolta circa Pulp Fiction

yes, file an FBAR
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:23:38
short, sweet, accurate. Well put.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:30:48
can't believe this actually worked. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-09-27 05:06:09
According to PwC tax services formal advice, it is because it’s the internet (global), so you should be filing an FBAR.
