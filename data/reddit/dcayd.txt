Its a digital currency. I would say $1000 is a perfect amount to invest if you could afford to lose that, although I and many here would argue that you will surely make money as you would still be an early investor at this point. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:04:25
Your asking how to make more money not how to get a bitcoin. Get a better income source. Builders make good money in my area!

Not sure about Amazon credit to bitcoin, but I know you could easily turn that amazon credit into USD and than buy bitcoin with the USD. Most pawn shops by gift cards for 66%  value, or you could sell it on craigslist or another local exchange site. I would expect to get $600 cash for an $800 gift card. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:37:28
For what its worth, I "bought now after doing about %50 of the research I should have" at 4200 and I wish I had bought a week early when it was much lower. Most of us investors are seeing it over 5k by years end, heck it may hit 4700 today. But if you can't afford to lose $1000 than absolutely do not put it in bitcoin. Maybe just do $500 or $250.

I couldn't decide if I thought leaving the Trezor with his wife was the better option or not. Either way works great really, and either way gives him pretty fast access to his coins if he needs to sell.

Did you buy bitcoin or did you make a money transfer to your account? If you bought bitcoin using your checking account than it will take 7 days for the bitcoin to become available in your coinbase account for you to use. You have been locked into the price that you bought at. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:50:38
Craigslist, localbitcoins, cryptotrade, bitcoin ATM, finding a person with bitcoin to sell you that bitcoin for cash, which would be easiest depending on your location. Put up a craigslist ad looking for bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-29 04:23:28
The price that you buy on coinbase is always going to be alittle higher than current market price. Same when you go to sell on coinbase, it will be a little lower. Coinbase provides these prices when you make these transactions, no one tricked you or anything. If you want to buy and sell at the exact current price then you need to use GDAX.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:03:46

you'd have to use a laptop or something to pull up the trezor but you could transfer from your trezor wallet to the vendor. An easier way would be to keep a spendable amount of bitcoin in a wallet on your phone for quicker/easier transactions daily.

People were waiting to see what would happen at 10k. As soon as it became apparent that more people wanted to buy at 10k than wanted to sell (this happened in seconds) the price sky rockets to where we are now. Looks like more people want bitcoin right now than want to sell it. Also it is trending on Facebook, and is in the headlines of many papers right now for the 10k breach. I think its almost to the top of Reddit as well.

You can have multiple accounts on one hardware wallet, atleast you can on a Trezor. I would not suggest sharing any kind of financial accounts with a family member though. Family relationships can get nasty, and even nastier when money is involved. The hardware wallets are not very expensive, I would suggest getting your own to store your own coins.

My man! That's the way to do it right there. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:51:42
You can transfer from coinbase to a hard wallet for a small fee. BUT you can do it for free just as easily. Transfer from coinbase to Gdax, and then Gdax to your hard wallet and there will be no fee. I just did it this morning and realized how easy it is. 
I would buy a trezor for any amount of bitcoin that you have. It gives you a sense of enjoyment and security to have your bitcoin "in your hands". $500 would certainly upset you if you lost it in an exchange hacking wouldn't it? Just go ahead and get a hard wallet. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:54:01

@_date: 2017-09-01 14:28:49
Fair enough, I learned how to change the quality on youtube so that is cool. Gdax looks pretty good on mobile already though. I do enjoy the music, but don't exactly trust a feed of the exchange while trading, I like to see the actual exchange. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 11:50:37
We almost hit 5k, A % of people wanted to sell at 5k and they did. We're also in the middle of a holiday weekend, no one is day trading today, well not as many as during the regular work week. It's also a sunday, it's going to be a slow day. Tueday will make you happy again.

@_date: 2017-09-02 14:06:38
Not exactly. Lets say that coinBase goes out of business or someone that works there steals coins from customers. You may legally be obligated to get those coins back and you may get them back, after a trial, after several months of waiting and being anxious about it, and after many price changes that you may have wanted to sell at. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:47:08
It does the same for me, I actually got rid of my savings account and only use checking now because I didn't see the point in having separate accounts anymore. I moved some of my cold savings to bitcoin and I've gained more in "interest" in less than a month than a bank would have given me in 20 years. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:53:21

Not the banks, but if you watch the exchanges you'd have seen that some serious money is moving in and out of bitcoin the last couple days. I'm seeing 250-350 coin transactions coming through gdax that means someone with serious money has some faith in bitcoin, which is good for us!

There is a balance somewhere between promoting bitcoin and giving investment advice to those who you care about. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:58:38
Coinbase has notoriously bad customer service. It provides a great way to buy bitcoin, I use it, but their customer service is absolute shit. If they get hacked, you may or may not get your coins back and if you do it may take up to a year to get them back, during which time the price of bitcoin may crash or go up and you may want to sell and you wouldn't have that ability. Coinbase may do something illegal or have an employee do something illegal and steal your money. Same situation, you may get your coins back but it will take time and effort to do so. You can just get rid of this potential headache by using a Hard ware wallet like a trezor. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:02:09

Coinbase and Gdax are the same company so your log in with coinbase will work on Gdax. Log into Gdax and get your recieve address and put that address into the send address on Coinbase. Then send them from Gdax to a hardwallet such as a Trezor. 
Best wallet out there these days is a Trezor in my opinion

You can use multiple exchanges. Use coinbase for the 50k weekly, use another exchange for another 50k, use 5 exchanges and your able to get out 250k a week, if you need more than that I would think you'd have more connections and abilities.

realistic answer:
if you buy now and bitcoin hits 10k your $106 will be around  $212.
If bitcoin hits 20k you'll have around $424.
