You're a fool.

The point of the OP you responded to was that right wing politicians are hypocrites, because they always claim to champion individual liberties, but really don't. I was clarifying that in my post to you. I am not making any claims that small government is bad.
@_date: 2019-07-15 00:20:11
Why does your feelings have any bearing on the price of bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-07-12 12:40:14
Ah yes, buy low sell high. Easy money. We should all be billionaires by now.
@_date: 2019-07-19 13:22:16
Bitcoin not manipulated at all though of course.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:18:44
I got mine last night and choose Segwit. I transfered my BTC from coinbase to the ledger with no issue (took like 2 hours though).
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:58:02
But what happens when LTC blocks get full? It has the same problems as BTC. We need Lightning Network.
@_date: 2019-07-14 19:57:29
Maybe, but the right prances around pretending to care about "small government" any chance they get.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:54:23
Yeah, I don't understand how the LN is the solution we've been waiting for. It's confusing as hell, despite reading a bunch about it. It also has to be actually be widely used and implemented by people and vendors. People won't even switch to segwit, why would they use the LN?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:36:38
I think the issue here is that a lot of us don't care what any of these crypto celebrities say. We compile evidence and information and critically think about the situation ourselves.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:14:19
If this happened and assuming you kept the btc, how would taxes work on it? How would the government know this is legitimate?
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:02:31
Bigger blocks absolutely will help in the short term.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:35:43
No one is suggesting going to 500mb blocks right now. The suggestion is to scale up slowly as demand and technology increases.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:03:35
That wasn't very nice. Do you have something constructive to reply? These issues are serious.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:22:24
I use gemini. The $500 limit is a bit annoying, but also forces dollar-cost averaging, so that's nice. You can also do a bank wire transfer though if you really want more than $500/day.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:18:44
No one has explained to me how this is the case. Continually scaling block size is a fine solution. As long as the scaling corresponds with advancements in internet and memory. 10gb blocks in 20 years will not be a problem.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:17:06
This is fallacious thinking. BCH doesn't need to scale to terabyte blocks today. The idea is to incrementally increase blocksize alongside tech advancement and demand.
Memory and bandwith get cheaper everyday.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:02:54
I sent 2k worth of bitcoin to binance yesterday for 11 dollars. Took 30 minutes to arrive. I'm just not seeing the crazy fees and slow speeds everyone else is apparently.
EDIT: I have a segwit address so maybe that's why. I'd recommend using segwit. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:41:05
It's been a raging bull market since 2009. All you had to do is put your money in index funds and you'd be up an absurd amount.
You need to stop trying to time markets and stop day trading. Buy a diversified portfolio in the form of broad market index funds and let it sit for a couple decades. Make sure the vast majority of your money is  invested this way, and set some number aside for crypto. 
And with crypto, don't be panic selling when there is a dip. Buy and hold. It's as simple as that. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:51:09
I'm not from I argue with those clowns just as much as I argue with you guys. Like 1% of the population can think for themselves.
@_date: 2019-11-05 18:18:05
You hope society collapses? I don't think you understand how shitty your life will become if that happens, if you even make it through the collapse alive.
@_date: 2019-08-16 16:44:49
This NPC meme strikes me as extraordinarily dehumanizing and arrogant.
@_date: 2019-08-19 22:35:49
It was a joke you walnut.
@_date: 2019-08-16 16:46:47


I think many of us here do not buy into this. I'm a long time holder but I don't have a problem with central banks. In my view, Bitcoin can act as a moderating, decentralized force in the financial world to mitigate central power, but you don't have to throw the baby out with the bath water. Bitcoin and centralized banks can live in harmony.
@_date: 2019-08-16 16:41:50
Most of the community are crooks? You have to be trolling.
@_date: 2019-08-28 19:53:03
It may stabilize, or it may go up or down.
@_date: 2019-08-12 15:35:17
People have been predicting a "big correction" for the last decade. Timing the market is dumb. Continually put money in and forget about it.
@_date: 2019-08-05 13:51:22
Dude, no.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:44:38
You guys need to stop trying to time the market, it's seriously stupid and just straight up gambling.
@_date: 2019-06-29 17:09:40
It is terrifying to think so much of the Bitcoin community is this financially illiterate.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:49:34
Roger Ver stated in a recent interview he still holds BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:54:46
Uh because I want to be a billionaire buddy.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:03:52
Confirmation bias combined with generally insane volatility. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:43:02
Sadly people are utter morons with money. I fear this advice will go ignored. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:06:55
Roger Ver comes off as really immature here, but he makes a couple good points. I'm super skeptical about the Lightning Network and worried generally about Btc's transaction fees and speed problems.
I have a stake in BTC, but also ETH, and it's hard to argue with the statement that it'd just be easier for people to switch to ETH than for wide adoption of the lightning network.
I really want both to succeed, but BTC will need to show big steps in solving these problems in 2018 for it to succeed long term, I think.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:16:28
Uh visa transaction fees are 1.5%. I think we are fine. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:17:39
Shit, Jim Cramer on board? Time to sell my bitcoin. God damnit.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:42:08
I don't subscribe to the bitcoin philosophy, I'm just here to get rich. So I'm going to cash out to fiat when the time comes. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:40:37
Oh my god.  1.8m is more than enough to live on. That's like 70,000/yr on safe withdraw @ 4%. My early retirement goal is just 1.2M.
PLEASE sell your BTC and put it in safe investments. Your future is 100% secured if you do this. If you want to keep working, feel free to do so, and let your money grow in an index fund. PLEASE DO THIS.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:46:06
It's unfucking believable that people are downvoting you. This is the absolute best advice. BTC is a massively speculative asset. Take your lottery winnings and work shit out with your wife. Holy christ.
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:00:29
No one is a fool for cashing out a 2 million dollar speculative asset.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:30:44
Or buy the rumor, buy the news, and hold.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:26:48
More like Cardano.
I have stakes in all of this though, so if any or all could win that'd be greaaat.
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:31:03
You're talking to a bot, bro.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:35:55
Hey thanks buddy.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:58:08
If you're selling to take profits, then yeah, of course that's not "timing the market".
If you're selling with the intent to use that money to buy lower, then that's timing the market.
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:16:32
It's a worthless article anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:10:43
If you haven't sold your BTC then you are not FIRE, just to be clear, and I wouldn't drop your job on the basis of BTC continuing to grow at 2.5% per week.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:38:38
Fuck yes, what a brilliant idea.
@_date: 2018-02-19 00:23:07
Nano. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:57:21
Dont listen to these idiots. No one can time the market, least of all bitcoin. It's better to be in the market than to try to time it. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:40:05
But...if you never sold you never made money either.. 
@_date: 2019-05-28 14:29:42
I actually feel worse about bitcoin when these kinds of people come out of the woodwork and make wild bullish predictions.
No one knows whats going to happen. Anyone that says otherwise is wildly speculating.
