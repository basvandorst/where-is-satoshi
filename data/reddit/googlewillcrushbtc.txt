Its not successful yet likely for two reasons:
1. Its still being rolled out, and most people don't know about it
2. Its only offered in the US at the moment
I'm extremely interested in using Google Wallet, but I live outside the US
Google is a huge global company, so they can probably get this service available in many countries eventually
Why would they care about shitting on Bitcoin? Google Wallet isnt even a direct reaction to it, so its not as though Google is seen to be deliberately acting to take down Bitcoin

Your post literally has no point

They are doing it though
Google has been rolling out the feeless Google Wallet feature for about a year now - its still gradually being rolled out
They've also invested in Ripple in the past
This is only the beginning
Theres nothing ridiculous about making money from ad revenue on transactions though. Perhaps they would do something different, but its easy to imagine them cashing in on what they know best and what makes them the most money. Its not just about money either - they are interested in getting as many people into their web as possible (i.e. just look at other projects, like Google Plus)

Read the last paragraph of my OP

Why give away part of their market share?
Why cooperate with or integrate a system susceptible to fraud, multiple facets, etc?
I could go on

You think that what people primarily want is a store of value
I disagree, or at least say that one part of what people want is a feeless and efficient way of transferring money
I know I do, and for store of value I invest in precious metals - so I treat the two seperately
Not to mention Bitcoin fails to function as a store of value. You only have to look at the volatility of the price to see that.
I grant you that Google Wallet is different from Bitcoin in that it does not purport to be a speculative commodity which one can make riches from

Once you deposit the money into the Google wallet, you can use it instantly whenever you want
Its the same with Bitcoin BTW - you have to spend time buying Bitcoins before you can actually use them
Paypal also requires you to set up and verify a bank account, and it always takes time to withdraw money because its a bank deposit form of withdrawal
What matters most is the reliability, feelessness and convienance
Say for example I buy sell an item for $100. The person who buys it would normally have to pay a fee for instant payment via Paypal, or I would have to nervously wait on 3 day bank deposit. With Google Wallet its instant though, and then I can later withdraw that to my bank account.
I don't think most people are too concerned about waiting 3 days for a deposit. They are worried about trust in the transaction itself, and waiting times can kill that possibility (I.e. if its an instant pick up, how can I wait for 3 days for payment?)
Anyone who really needs the money to or from their bank account straight away could pay the reasonable 2.9% fee, but I'm sure most would appreciate the fee less option

Even if that were true, so what? 
Its irrelevant and is not a counter-argument to what I have argued

Anyone using adblock wouldn't be able to see the ad, as they do now
I didn't suggest it would be intrusive like a video - I suggested a simple text ad, perhaps displayed above or below or to the side of the transaction process.
These would be valuable ads nonetheless. Just think about it: You're delivering an ad to someone you know who has money, and uses it online. Plus if you add in an incentive from Google to make further purchases..
As for the new fee, is that in effect yet? The problem with lowering fees is that its unsustainable in the long run. Over time, as block rewards gradually dry up, the money to miners has come from transaction fees. So its disingenuous to make out that transaction fees will be low in the future - they are guaranteed to rise, not fall.
I explained how people could make small amounts from Google wallet - they could receive the same amount as AdWords displayers do. And Google would have direct access to all the exact analytics for advertisers.

I don't gamble, sorry
Also the fact you have to resort to making bets instead of counter-arguments, shows you have no strong counter-arguments and rely instead upon brazen or wishful thinking

Will we be seeing the same rapid 'price appreciation' youve been talking about since 4 months ago?
@_date: 2014-03-26 22:37:44
So far down ~55% in 4 months for Bitcoin
Its going to take Bitcoin a lot more than 10% per year just to make up for losses
@_date: 2014-03-24 19:22:05
In regards to the point about transactions fees, even if they allowed more transactions per second, it would still be the same required amount coming from the same pool of totals - so in the end, whether or not one individual manages to benefit, the group on the whole pays the same as required.
What I wonder is why they have not implemented percentage-based fees, so that low-value transactions are subsidized. Not unfairly to encourage abuse of low-value transactions, since say 1% would be paid in total no matter which way you went about it. I suppose the reason is because allowing for lots of small transactions would inflate the size of the blockchain rapidly, though I am no programmer.

You do realize that you can use Google wallet without a credit card right?
Also with Google wallet you can send money to family, friends, etc. so its not just a credit card auto fill as you describe
Go away shill.

How would encouraging people to use Bitcoin, increase Google's user base, any more than if Google offered its own alternative?
Also its not as though people are going to stop using Google if they create a competitor to Bitcoin - especially not at the current time, when hardly anyone uses Bitcoin

Google Wallet is not meant to be a store of value - its value lies in it being a quick, reliable, and fee less means of exchange
If you're interested in non-fiat currency, it appears Google is working on that (just look at their investment in Ripple)
Google Wallet doesn't need VC investment, which is actually a good thing as it simplifies matters
Google is a massive company. Its stock price is twice that of Apple. It could easily become a big player in this market
@_date: 2014-03-24 18:33:04
No, they just have to get a warrant to raid the exchange for personal identity documents linked to funds contained in the address
Game over
Thats the problem with shitcoin - Bitcoin itself may be watertight, but the centralized exchanges which are the unavoidable ins and outs of the system are more loose than the anus of a male protstitute in San Francisco
