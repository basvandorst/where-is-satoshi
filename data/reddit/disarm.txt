That's really interesting information, thanks for sharing.. How did you find that out?

This is terrifying.

As much as I want to like Rand Paul for this, the fact that he is: against abortion, against same sex marriage, pro tea-party, wants to slash education funding, stoutly against introducing stricter gun control laws, against universal healthcare/reform, and wants to eliminate the government ability to manage the economy stating that the 'free market' will guide itself... Ugh... I'm still anti-Rand Paul, but the fact that he's accepting bitcoin is totally awesome. I really wish someone like Elizabeth Warren would run for president, all other beliefs aside, I think her willingness to bring accountability to bring greater fairness to the economy is spectacular. 
While I think that it's dumb the mods in are blocking you from posting the article, I don't blame them. Rand Paul is like 1 part good and 9 parts awful... The only thing I like about his platform is net neutrality... Overall his views seem so contradicting and saying stuff like 'We need to demilitarize the police.' and 'Citizens have their right to guns [to shoot the police with].' in the same sentence is mind boggling to me.

Hey man, I really like your site. I'll be making some purchases on here.
I just lost my vape when I was down in SD and I need to purchase a new one. I had a IPV Mini 2 and Atlantis tank, I saw you recommend the Nemesis Mod with a Keyfun Atomizer. How is that in comparison to my old setup? I've usually bought in store and I don't feel like dropping another $150 to buy back my previous gear although the Atlantis tank was stellar.

This 100x
We're not going to get bitcoin to become a widely accepted and adopted currency if we don't do the work on our end to make it more understandable to the general public. 
Shutting people out because they don't 'get it' and cheering those on that do is not the way this is going to ever become popular.

Based on that prediction, you should have bought in at 80.

How does a post like this even make it to the front page? Shame on the mods.

Very nice site, I hope to see the volume pick up here :)
How are you implementing margin trades?
@_date: 2013-08-17 06:54:36
Agree, ALWAYS use trusted sources, or heavily research if you are going to use unknown 3rd parties...

I like CBX as well, but unfortunately just like mtgox, they suffer from HUGE lag whenever the HF traders come in just like gox. 
Have yet to find an exchange that is able to sustain the trade spam from HFTs when there is high market volatility...

I didn't realize I had the option to ask for reimbursement, I'll remember that the next time the game glitches out if I ever play on the site again. Cheers!

You're going to regret it when you realize you could have bought 10 BTC when the price hits 100.

Why are you only answering the boring questions?
@_date: 2013-04-30 01:28:37
That's a lot of hardware errors........

How are you able to place shorts on BTC-e?
