Hahah yah right go check out the Coinbase Reddit thread, 100’s of people with issues getting $$ in and out. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:12:59
Yah that’s the ones posting, FYI the Coinbase backlog of support tickets is over 20,000 as of the first week in December.  By now it’s probably 50,000 that platform is so busted.
I could care less if you like Coinbase or not, there customer support is shit and there platform is a joke.  They are to greedy to stop signing up new suckers over helping people that have issues caused by them.

Been verified and wired money into Coinbase from that same account 1 month earlier 
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:08:36
Was it a wire transfer or or ACH?

Find a good education resource. I have heard good things about this site and the courses they offer. Think they have a public FB group as well

No idea what you are talking about I just made a trade and it’s at $6,693.80

You are lucky if it ever even shows up. Did a wire transfer 3 months ago that is still
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:27:13
Exactly! Your an idiot that should not be buying any investment via a credit card.  
Sorry that is harsh but 100% true.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:59:58
No as in a wire transfer

What a joke, they can’t even provide customer service on 4 coins.  Good luck falling flat on your face screwing up the n the payment side.  Coinbase must have 500,000 open support tickets by now, guess they want to break a million by end of Q1 LOL

@_date: 2018-02-04 20:09:55
When does trading go live?
@_date: 2018-02-16 05:57:42
Binance, Bittrix or Kraken can’t be used? First I have ever heard of that
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:00:25
From PR?
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:39:03
1 hour really means 3 hours, be prepared the customer service rep with do nothing for you.  
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:02:29
Yep that’s as much as I could find as well.  It’s 4 states to start but was an exact date never published?

What exchange are the coins purchased? Is it only for bitcoin?
