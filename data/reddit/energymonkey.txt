The USD reserve status isn't enforced by our military. If the world thinks there is a better currency to replace it then it will happen; it's even been brought into question in the past few years. The major reasons why the USD is the world's reserve currency is because the US plays a big role in the world economy and our debt (treasuries) are the safest in the world.

3% is a little high, the Federal Reserve's target rate is set at 2.0% just like in Australia, Canada, Colombia, the European Union, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Poland, Romania, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. So I guess the whole world is in on it too. Here's a [table]( of central banks from around the world, all have **inflation** targets.


Inflation is implemented for several reasons, none of which you will care to consider because I'm already wrong before I type it. So, I'm just putting it out there for anyone who is still reading this thread.
* "Spending drives the economy." -Ray Dalio [How The Economic Machine Works]( - It does. If everyone horded their money, their money becomes useless because no one invested their money in assets that would produce something people could buy. It's true, you can't keep up with inflation by putting it in a **safe** savings account. If you're not investing it (putting it to work) than why should you get any yield for it. Money that isn't working is losing its real value. The inflation target is set to encourage spending within an economy instead of saving.
The European Central Bank is considering implementing a negative interest rate essentially penalizing banks for not using the money left sitting in their vaults.
* Wage expectations - This is more of a theory that I've heard bounced around but it goes something along the lines of you and I expecting to be paid more than are actual productive worth. Productivity growth is economic growth and thereby leads to wage growth. If you have no productivity growth but wage growth you're not increasing the real value of what you're being paid. Inflating currency is great way of tricking the unknowing people into thinking they're getting paid more.
* Deflation is more dangerous than inflation - It is generally accepted among the economic academia that deflation is more dangerous than inflation because it is much harder to recover from. Japan from the 1990s is a great example.
* Population Growth - If you don't inflate your currency to keep up with population growth your currency becomes scarce and increases in value, or deflates. Mr. Money Bags doesn't have to worry because he's got plenty of money, but Joe only has a few dollars to his name. Mr. Money Bags will invest his money to produce products Joe can buy. Joe however doesn't want to spend his money because he doesn't have a-lot of it and knows its value will increase, so he buys what he only needs to get by. 
Mr. Money Bags isn't receiving the return on his investment he expected so either he must increase the cost of his product to Joe to make an adequate profit margin or reduce the price so Joe will buy it. Either choice will lead to failure of Money Bag's investment. Joe won't buy his product because it's too expensive or Joe will buy his product but his business will still fail because the product was sold for less than what it cost to produce. This mentality starts a deflationary spiral that can severely hurt an economy if not remedied correctly.

So in other words they are doing their part to help the economy. Unemployment is now at 6.7% and inflation is actually below where it should be (at 2%). 
If your arguing that inflation has ruined the purchasing power of the American people over the course of the Federal Reserve's existence you're ignoring a-lot of variables. We live in a very globalized economy. John (more than likely) is no longer competing for a job with his neighbor, he is competing with someone in China. Wages have remained seemingly stagnant for the large part because the supply of cheap labor has increased dramatically over the past 3 decades. 
Since the 2007-2008 Financial Crisis corporations have been cutting costs to increase earnings. The crisis has also created a much more debt averse population. This is reflected by the low inflation rate we've had over the past 2 years, going on to 3. The Fed has done their part to encourage economic growth.
@_date: 2014-03-28 18:02:35
Bitcoin should always be considered a commodity, it is not currency or money. The fact that it is deflationary invalidates your point and division is really no different than a company's stock splitting.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:05:45


True but don't forget about the other side of the story. For as many Apples that exist there are just as many Compaqs that no longer exist. There are big risks in the early stages of any company; their prices reflect that. My point being that there are just as many big winners as there are losers; in the macroeconomic scale nothing really changed. You hear about all the big winners because no one wants to hear a story about a man who lost $500 million.


Deflationary policies can essentially create the same problem in different ways. Deflationary policies make the rich even more richer than the poor. Yeah the real value of the poor man's money will increase but this will also encourage the poor man to be more thrifty about his spending than the rich man effecting what kind of goods are actually produced. Goods tailored to the poor will no longer be profitable to produce in their current state and will face cuts in quality, amount, etc or the eventual end of their production; this reduces their standard of living. As for the rich their spending will remain relatively the same leading to the overall production of goods shifting towards the wealthy.
I will probably be downvoted because it sounds like I'm hating on Bitcoin. That seems to be the tone on this sub-reddit even if a post poses an interesting argument.

The reserve status of the US dollar is not dependant on the size of our economy but the safety and stability of it. You could even argue it's geographical location contributes to it's reserve status.
As for other candidates:
-China has a lot of political and social issues that effect the overall stability of the country.
-Europe has a track record of being divided politically and economically.
-Bitcoin is far too new and its economic implications have pretty much been untested.

Seriously? There will be people who disagree with your beliefs regarding many subjects, not just bitcoin. But does that mean that they are also on some smear campaign to destroy your reputation?
I don't troll however I think a contrary point of view is healthy. I don't believe in the success of Bitcoin; I'm not being a contrarian because I want to. With something as new as Bitcoin I think it's very important that both sides of the matter are studied carefully. I and others are simply using the internet in one of it's intended ways: to educate.
One important factor that encourages me as an investor to educate others is price. The volatility of Bitcoin's price indicates it's a financial instrument with a great amount of risk. It's volatility can be blamed upon fundamentals, manipulation, etc. At any rate when something's value fluctuates that much I think it's important that people are educated about that something.
If I'm considered a troll than you all should reevaluate who you're calling out here.

This is what happens when you deregulate free markets. Entities with larger amounts of capital will gain capital more easily than smaller ones. 


Easy to say when you ignore China, India and other emerging markets. Interesting that he is determining the standard of living solely based upon household income and ignoring GDP.






It was over but far from recovery. It would take another 5 years before the unemployment rate dropped to within much more acceptable levels.


Mr. Stockman is ignoring a very important factor, human psychology. The collapse of Lehman Brothers was a massive psychological hit upon Wall Street and Main Street that spread beyond the financial sector. People do not act rationally therefore markets don't either. When you combine panic with herd mentality people miss the details, so regardless of how strong a corporation's balance sheet or how positive the circumstances may be everyone may still consider it junk or the circumstances hopeless. Even the most level-headed investors wanted to get out during the financial crisis, how can you blame them when the S&amp;P was down 30-50%. But then the US government and Fed come to save the day.
Their actions were a psychological benefit for the world economy. People regained their confidence, money and capital flowed back into Main Street and Wall Street. Here was the US government playing the game to encourage everyone else to join them; they were acting as a catalyst.


Again, you're missing the psychological factor.

If you want to see what would happen if we had gone the other route, even just a little bit, check out the EU. They're stuck at an unemployment rate of 12.1% and if I remember correctly forecasted GDP growth is even expected to make 1% this year. The EU is an example of what happens when austerity measures are taken too far.

Or maybe they are just tired of Bitcoin supporters going on and on about how their currency is better and everyone needs to use it. I'm perfectly happy using my greenbacks at the moment; the US dollar does it's job just fine for me. I see no reason to inconvenience myself just to attain bitcoin.
Yes it might be advantageous to use in certain cases. Those cases are limited however and at the moment conventional currencies are much easier and safer to use.

If I was in your situation I wouldn't put anything in Bitcoin at the moment. Less than a month of a somewhat stable price doesn't mean that a potential investment is actually stable. Your goal here is to preserve the wealth you have and I see two choices you can make.
(1) Long term choice (1 to 5 years) - Ride it out. Everyone is taking a hit from the problems not only in your country but in other emerging markets. Too much money was put into these countries thinking their economic growth rate would remain the same ignoring inherent risks whether it be economic, political or fiscal policy. You know more about your country's situation than I do, if you think the situation will start to stabilize in the year than I wouldn't move any of your money. If you think the situation will get much worse and or you need to use your money soon than move it. Keep in mind when the 2008 world financial crisis hit a-lot of people thought the end was here (The S&amp;P index dropped from 14k to just 880 points).
When things look bad everyone panics selling what they can only thinking of preserving what they have at that moment.
(2) Short term choice (less than 1 year) - Buy US T-Bills. United States Treasury Bonds are the safest investment in the world. If people lose faith in these you can be sure that everyone is going down.

It is an asset/virtual commodity, I will give you that. But that is in a separate class from currency.


Higher volatility is NOT okay. If the value of the USD fluctuated like Bitcoin our people, the world, would want nothing to do with it. People don't trust the stock market when it goes up and down by 2% in a week; what makes you think people in general would trust Bitcoin if it fluctuated by 20% in the same time frame? You're touting all the innovative benefits about online transactions being easier and cheaper but ignoring the elephant in the room. Not only is it flawed by economic design but its value is also tied to the USD.
Gold is a horrible store of value and is tied to the overall perception of the current and future health of the global economy. I had to address this because this misinformation is brought up far to often.
Don't get me wrong, there are some useful aspects of Bitcoin. I hate using Paypal. However I think Bitcoin will not be the answer to crypto-currencies because something else will do everything Bitcoin can without the significant economic flaws. Then there will be no need for Bitcoin.

The Fed is not simply "printing" or "creating" money, they are buying assets: US T-Bills and Mortgage-backed securities to be exact. These are the safest investments anyone can purchase; since the Fed has been buying them up with QE (reducing their return), financial institutions must look elsewhere. Elsewhere means riskier assets.
During QE cash has flooded into emerging markets from China to Argentina. As a result the value of their currencies (and economies) increased abnormally. The inflation you're talking about didn't occur domestically because it happened somewhere else, with their currency.
The fundamental idea of QE is to force investors to put their capital in riskier assets in the hope that these assets will stimulate economic growth. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 00:30:32
All that money printing you are referring to is backed primarily by the purchase of mortgage back securities and US Treasuries. The $700 billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 entailed the purchase of "toxic" or junk assets to give financial institutions capital in a time when the whole economy had entered a dangerous stall. Quantitative Easing continued a similar policy by purchasing more mortgage back securities and safe US T-Bills. The abnormal purchase of T-Bills has reduced their yields forcing investors to put their capital in riskier assets (i.e. back into the world economy where it needed to be at the time).
It's easy to point at a single thing and say "look that's horrible, that's not right!" without studying the details as to why and how. You can ignore what I have to say, the fact of the matter is had we not done it circumstances would be a-lot worse. Read into what happened with the Europe Union and their aggressive austerity measures to get a glimpse of an alternative policy.

Yet you're using it as a currency in the above manners. If my Bitcoin will be worth more next week than I should wait to buy smart property then, or maybe next year when it's worth even more. Think of this situation as grocery shopping, you want to buy the most food you can with the least amount of money.

Yes I honestly do. I know it's not exactly a popular view but what motives do they have to screw us over?
If they make a bad decision that results in an economic downturn everyone involved is hurt, even the people that work for the Fed. Not only is their reputation tarnished but just like everyone else their money (and retirement) sits in global markets. It doesn't take a-lot of digging to realize that the world practically revolves around the US economy. Whatever happens here affects economies around the world to a significant extent. If the Fed makes a mistake it is NOT because they want to hurt or crash the economy, it's because they thought it would help the economy.
Systemic risk, that is what this is all about. Whatever the Fed does must be in the best interests of our own economy and foreign ones. If they choose to do the opposite no one truly benefits.

That seems to be the common belief on r/bitcoin, inflation sucks. Then when I explain why it's important nobody has a valid rebuttal.

I don't necessarily disagree with it (though I believe there are more factors at play such as tax rates and their yields), but using either of those sources puts up a red flag for not only myself but many investors who depend on economic news to make decisions.

This hysteria is not just restricted to bitcoins but any investment or instrument whose value varies wildly. The people who have poured a significant amount of their own capital into bitcoins need to take this as a lesson; they need to study up on economics and how to invest to minimize losses. Playing markets is not easy and takes a-lot of time and research.
Don't follow blindly by what the crowd thinks, make your own decisions. Study all the variables that can effect the price of your investment, and be ready for the impossible (whether it be good or bad). This is the only way to be smart about where you put your money.
You won't always be right, but you will be right more times than you will be wrong.
