If you dont need the money i would sell when btc goes below 5500$ . 
There is a good chance that it doesnt and it might hit 10k, 20k or 100k in the future.

Luckily in most free countries taxes only apply if you cash out for profits .

Hi im offering 115$ for 0.02 btc..i guess there will be some fees aswell. Can send to your Paypal but i wont send the money first. 
i am buying about 100$ worth of crypto every week so it would be no problem to help you out.

Why hasnt it gone below 6k in nearly a year ?
@_date: 2018-09-07 00:12:27
Im starting to think nobody is really selling (except for traders and miners) .. its mainly a few whales  and stop loss triggers that are responsible for days like yesterday..
 i dont think people hold for 9 months downtrend and then start to panic sell

Stop caring what your parents say. If they dont let you invest in btc they arent good parents anyways.
My mom would have let me invest in porn with 10 if i wanted to.

Why not CAD to BTC?

Realisticly prob around 10k but it could be 25k or 5k.. who knows.

To be fair, there is a way to buy from Amazon with bitcoin and 5-10% discount. 
Cryptozombie did a vid on that a few days ago and ordered some stuff
I guess the company that does it gets 10-20% off amazon and they offer it for a small discount so that they get cheap btc, which they can either sell directly or hold.

Such a bad post. The moment you pay is the moment you agree to the transaction. Meaning you will get 10 chicken wings no matter what.
KFC will end up with 15% less money, but they couldn't care less because it is A, still a profit and B might be worth more in the future.

No taxes if you hold 1 year or more and cash out.
Only tax if cash out profits exceed 10k (per year in case of not holding for 365 days)
Basically there are no taxes for normal investors unless you make a lot and cash out within 1 year of investing.
Professional traders can trade as much as they want and have to declare their profits which are taxed between 25 and 50% depending how much they made.
Austria and Germany are awesome when it comes to crypto

This is the definition of a bitcoin maximalist.

Dont sell those alts, there is a decent chance that they will have their turn soon. Is it gurantees? No
If you can spend those 2000... how about you set 4 500$ buy orders.
500 at 8111
500 at 8666
500 at 9111
500 at 9666
Something like that.
If it hits .. great for you.. if not... then you have to wait for a good entry point..
Buying now is a mistake. Even if it goes to 20k before pulling back.
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:01:21
Its your friends fault for losing these bitcoin.
Not their keys, not their bitcoin.
Why would someone even invest for friends and keep all their things. Just a matter of time until something goes wrong

Mining in Norway for example, where many miners are located is very enviroment friendly and has no negative effects because they use water power. This is just an example why your statement is bullshit 
@_date: 2019-02-13 09:08:27
The way the elecricity is being produced is wrong. 
Not Bitcoins fault and as already stated there are countries where mining Bitcoin is environmental friendly because the electricity is being produced in a clean way.

We pay lots of taxes and our schools are falling apart. Hospitals are basically non existent and roads are bad.
What are we paying taxes for again? Oh right, to let a group of retards juggle with our money and fly with private jets.

Thats so much bullshit. Halvening doesnt change anything, except that less bitcoins will be mined. 
There are so many already in circulation...
Suggesting that halvening will start a new bullrun is just trying to extend the bear market.
Thats basically the same as it was all year in the bull market chinese, new year, wallstreet bonuses.. bla bla bla
Nobody knows when the new bullrun starts, it can be tomorrow or in 2 years.. as soon there is demand, the price will go up again.
