I've seen a number of posts/comments asking about this, so I'll break it down.
Here's a transcript of the subtitles. He was extremely nervous and made a few small mistakes in his actual speech, and said a lot of Japanese equivalent "ums" and "uhs." 
"moushiwake arimasen deshita"
This is a standard formal apology - I'm terribly sorry. In Japanese it sounds like "There's no excuse for what I've done," and is used in a huge variety of situations.
"system ni yowai tokoro ga atte bitcoin ga naku natte"
There were weaknesses in our systems and we've lost all the coins. More literally means "the coins are gone." Yes. They're gone, he says.
"Naku natte" comes from "naku naru" = to become no more. Not there anymore. 
"minasan ni sono kekka go meiwaku o okakeshite hontou ni moushiwake naku omoimasu."
The subtitlers increased the formality of his apology, I wouldn't expect a non-native speaker in one of the worst moments of his life to be spot-on. This is a variation on a humble and standard way of saying, I feel deeply sorry for the trouble I've/Mt.Gox has caused everyone as a result. That is what he said, the subtitlers took it from proper enough for a non-native to correct level of speech.

And I suppose a Forbes reporter was among them, tailing him around?
