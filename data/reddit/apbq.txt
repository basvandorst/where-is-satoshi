Buy all the available ASICS.
Start mining, without revealing the hashrate you own.
Once you own (way) over 51% of the hashrate, start a soft fork this way :
* blocks are mostly empty : only the coinbase and very high fee transactions - like fee &gt;= outputs
*  never mine above blocks other than yours.
Every week raise the level of fees for transactions you include :
* Week 1 : fee&gt;=outputs
* Week 2 : fee&gt;=2*outputs
* Week 3 : fee&gt;=3*outputs
After a few months, Bitcoin should be dead.
If the mining algorythm is changed, play the same game again.

A business whose business is simply to buy and hold {insert name of asset here} is called an "Investment Fund". Period.
There are very specific rules for taxing those businesses depending on the country where the fund is established and the country where you live, but the general rule is "taxes are paid by the holder of shares of the fund".

Once you have reasonable reasons to believe that whatever you do you will miss your plane the safest option is to just say "I will stop talking now, please do your job".
Don't answer questions like "how much bitcoin do you own" or "did you take drugs". Do not even say none/no. Let them search your luggage as they wish.
If they don't release you within minutes, ask them "am I detained ?". If they answer "no" say "ok, then I will leave now" (and leave calmly). If they answer "yes" ask them "ok then I want a lawyer to assist me". Then wait for a lawyer to come and explain the situation to him (it may take a few hours).
During the wait just DON'T SAY ANYTHING (except "please I would like to go to the toilets" or "can I have something to eat"). If you have any kind of medical condition (even if properly managed) also ask them to see a doctor and explain to him what you need (customs may detain you a LONG time so be sure to be able to get your treatment).
STAY POLITE, don't insult anybody, don't make any violent move. Just WAIT. If you have nothing suspicious in your luggage they will release you within minutes/hours (and you will miss your plane - and the company will not give you a free pass to the next plane).
Oh and by the way if you don't speak french and they are not fluent in your language ask for a translator : "JE NE COM PRAN PA LE FRAN SAY - HA VAY VOU KEL KUN KI PAR LE AN GLAY ?"

The SEPA rules are mandatory to any bank that pretends to do SEPA transfer. Currently it is ONE business day max between the sending and the receiving bank.
Worst case from a company to an individual should be no more than 3 business days if :
- the sending company sends money once a day only and you ask them after the "cut off" time
- the web access to your bank account is not updated in real time but once a day only (it happens).
If they (Kraken) say "5 business days" it just means they don't send money every day (that's not a fraud per se). That's not the bank's fault, that's Kraken's.
If they say "money has been sent" and it's not in your account 3 days later then they just lie, as MtGox has been lying for months and it can only end just the same.

They did use them to buy some drug on SR (or SR2 maybe ?), track the coins back to Bitcoin Central (yes the dealer was dumb enough to sell them there), then arrest the guy ...
It was explained during a Senate hearing this year.
Edit : apparently they did NOT track the coins back to the exchange - see davout's post below.

Yep the one that made all of their customers whole when that happened.
And that did no reopen until they were damn sure it could not happen again.
And that is a real company with a clear identity run by know persons.
The one that makes its KYC before you can deposit anything, no when you want to withdraw.

You will hold a promise from bank B to give you some bullions instead of a promise from bank A to give you some bullions.
So yes basically now bank B owns your gold.
Oh and by the way it's not gold, it's tungsten. Sorry for your loss.

Well I thought it was exactly the same thing. 
In bitcoin world you can ask for immediate delivery so any naked short that has not a future delivery date can (and should) end as a normal sell. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 16:00:33
Naked short selling HAS legitimate use cases in all commodity markets.
Imagine an oil rig company, or a corn farmer. They know that they will produce x tons of oil/corn in 6 months, but they need fresh money now to pay the bills. So they can sell their production "naked" for later delivery.
A bitcoin miner should be able to do the same.
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:22:51
Yes hopefully they can't or they wouldn't be just drug dealers.

Then why did you sign with you private key a transfer to a bitcoin address that you knew you did not have control over ?
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:10:43
You can think what you want it remains that buying and selling drugs is illegal in France and the customs were just doing their job.
Once drug dealers understand that Bitcoin is probably the worse currency to conduct illegal business we will all be better.

It relays transactions between other nodes. The more nodes, the more resistant the network is to ddos and stuff.
It doesn't mine by default, but if you don't mind waiting a million years to get a block, you can open the debug console and type "setgenerate true" to start mining with your CPU.
@_date: 2014-03-25 10:45:34
No they don't.
Current fiat volumes for all bitcoin exchanges is a joke for any bank.

What part of "unless you can prove that you own some specific goods that was taken by mistake by the liquidator" don't you understand ?
@_date: 2014-04-24 09:27:09
Because it works this way in every liquidation everywhere in the world unless you can prove that you own some specific goods that was taken by mistake by the liquidator.
But you don't own bitcoins unless you own the private key.

A block is valid as long as it contains only valid transactions.
An empty block (only the coinbase transaction) is valid.
There is no such thing as a transaction "excluded" from the block. If a transaction is not in a block, then it is not in the block, and that's it.

Once the attacker owns your web site, you must assume that all bitcoin addresses displayed to your customers are those of the attacker.
And if you don't know exactly when the attacker has first gained access, you must assume that no address ever displayed is still safe.

For play money you can trust someone else to generate the private keys for you, be it MtGox or the NSA.
You can put the threshold at 0.21 if you are really paranoid.
@_date: 2015-07-20 12:10:33
Because you cannot trust a hardware RNG to store real money (2.1 BTC or more) unless you have created it yourself, or else there is always a chance that its output is somehow predictible by the NSA or another party.
Private keys generated with dices and/or cards are *provably* not predictible.

The full regulatory framework of Bitcoin is already written here : 
@_date: 2015-09-23 09:06:13
In the Internet of Things, "a machine" may need to access services provided by "another machine" and pay for them. Right now the only way to do it is for the owner of the first machine to pay the owner of the second one.
With embeded mining chips, the first machine can just turn electricity into bitcoins, then send them to the second machine. The owner of the first machine will pay the electrity company, and that's it. The (owner of the) second machine will get bitcoins, that he/it may use to pay services to a third one.
Your cost of $6 probably includes the inflation schedule of Bitcoin (mining reward). It's already been accepted by all Bitcoin participants. The real (marginal) cost of a Bitcoin transaction is still orders of magnitudes lower.
Also 21 may very well use some form of sidechain to bundle the transactions of all its chips together and have only one settlement transaction on the Bitcoin network per block/hour/day.

Aha. I am not so sure of it so I will not bet. Plus it's very possible that if you are the new owner, you could very well manage to win the bet and still "lose" the funds later.
Anyway, the site had a very good reputation largely because the owners were clearly identified and known not to be scammers. It will take some time before it gets the same level of rep again.

You're injecting a infinite set (the set of valid strings) into a finite set (the set of possible hashes, which size is 2^256 at most) so:
- on average there is an infinite set of strings that correspond to a given hash
- given an input string, is you calculate (and store) its hash a sufficient number of times, you will come back to one of the previously calculated hashes at some moment, and from this moment forward you will be in a cycle where the hashes will repeat along the same sequence (that's your fixpoint). The size of this cycle cannot be greater than 2^256.
It is currently not known how many such cycles exist, but the number of them cannot be below 1.
