Slush has had bad luck for the last 3-4 weeks. I think it's just picking back up a bit.

Get a browser add-on (like [stylish]( create a new Style for the page, and add this CSS.
     url(" {
    body .overview{background-color: !important;font-weight:bold }
    }
Here's the preview
edit: nevermind.. You can just select one of charts, go to Settings and select light theme. Then go back to the homepage. The theme carries over. The only advantage of the CSS is that it makes the text bold.

The proof could be like IBM's Watson. Every DataMiner runs the search  with a randomized list of selectable search options. Random search options could be llike date span, time of day posted, the domain TLD, does it show up on reddit/facebook/social, so on. Each block your options reset or you run several random sets at once.. Every miner would come to a conclusion based on scanning the net. Once the same answer is found XX thousands of times or found in a certain percentage, it wins.
It would be the end of one sided polls where the local audience are the only ones on the poll. "We're going to take a quick poll. Go to our website and vote." Now you would just be like "lets see what the internet is really saying"

I have a Piper and I love it. Even though it may be a bit more for this kind of solution, it is a nice finished product that always sparks a conversation about online vs offline wallets. My biggest thing is not having to deal with an external printer and the security issues with having that printer connected to an online computer. *I hate messing with printers.*
It has a pretty good selection of print drivers built-in. Get one of the [Piper images]( and mount it to a raspberry pi and try it out. You can print wallets using the bitaddress.html or from the onboard vanitygen

That one must be mine, I guess they shipped to a different address..
 I pre-ordered last July. I'm having BFL flashbacks watching all these units floating around, and no word on shipping the ones that people actually paid for.

Nice. Would also need a payout setting like once every X days or once balance gets to a certain level. I don't have a lot of power and my tiny payout every block would weigh down the blockchain. 
edit: maybe not make it mandatory but just make it available. I think a lot more people would join the p2pool network (as a node) if it was easier.

Thankyou! This thing is awesome. I'm still going through it, but i'm very happy with the feel and quality of the hardware. I hope you get your eshop up soon. I want to buy some more..

still fun to think about though

You could make the flairs small and only reveal the text when hovered over, like or edit: they would still need limited character length because it shows the text when not using the reddit stylesheet.

I use bitpay. The only downside is that the money from them needs to be deposited into a business checking account that has a tax ID (EIN) number associated with it. Then its only a .99% fee and I get USD the next business day.
@_date: 2013-06-16 09:17:39
a lot of GPU miners will shift to Litecoin/Feathercoin
@_date: 2013-04-27 18:10:42
1- yes, BTC converted to USD and then deposited into my account at only a .99% fee
2- I dont know about getting BTC after paypal, paypal has a 3.5% fee

was this a PM? I don't see it on their wall.

You need to put the old "wallet.dat" in your bitcoin data directory, the default for Windows is:
C:\Documents and Settings\YourUserName\Application data\Bitcoin (XP)
C:\Users\YourUserName\Appdata\Roaming\Bitcoin (Vista and 7)
Then run the bitcoin client with the -rescan option.

My GPU miners cost about $35-40 a month in power each(plus any daytime surcharges that get added for peak rates. Higher on sunny days, more people pulling power for AC). Each rig cost about $8-900 to build using used ebay parts. Each one can mine about 40-50 LTC(currently $2.40 each) a month. They also make an incredible amount of heat. I have a box fan on each one and two windows with fans in the room venting air, (one in, one out). If none of the hardware dies, best case, it's about a 9-10 month payback w/ power. The downside is that I'm in the US so it's hard to get the money wired from an exchange without huge fees or even at all. My power bill is about $300-$340 total a month with no AC for 4 rigs (was about $150 before). I haven't cashed any out yet. I'm basically holding/trading coins in the hopes that in the future they will be more valuable and more usable.
Of course if you wanted to use the coins now, you could use a service like [Gyft]( [Bitmit]( or [Coingig](
@_date: 2013-04-27 03:44:24
yeah, that's it. Works like taking paypal, except they only take 1%. I get USD the next day.
@_date: 2013-10-14 21:14:42
That would suck.. but on the other hand, since the 'war on drugs,' a greater variety and quality of drugs are available to more people than ever before. This might spread bitcoin to the world faster.  :D
@_date: 2013-04-24 09:00:59
my miners are running normal. just the website is down right now.
@_date: 2013-04-24 21:37:36
grab a couple Ati/Amd video cards and start mining..
[Edit] If you have a bitcoin wallet and paypal/CC, you can buy partial coins on Ebay, but they usually upcharge for the %3-4 paypal fee and their own personal cut. You can get an ati 5770 for about $100, overclock it, join a mining pool (free), and it will mine ~200MHash/s = ฿0.34 a month.

Instead of having to mess with mtgox or a bitcoin trading type site, I was able to get payment into my account within a day. Now I can take Credit Cards, Paypal, Checks, and Bitcoin. I guess it was more for visibility for a service that actually worked for me.

it's easier than having the utilities/house in your name, wire transferring money to oversees places like mtgox, and passing their background checks which usually require you to be 18 and took me 2 weeks because of how many people are registered...
@_date: 2013-05-02 07:45:42
the blockchain QR is coded to the blockchain site. you can only send to that address. You need the wallet and private keys to send from your address.
@_date: 2013-04-26 21:59:48
Level of risk. You have to decide between security and convenience. I use a couple wallets on different devices that aren't connected to each other. Then transfer to a specific one depending on where/what I'm buying from. I spend a little extra on transfer fees, but I like having several layers security.
