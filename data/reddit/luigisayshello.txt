It could be either his words or cocaine. We will never know.

fair point, still a very shitty place to pass and be around.

WHAT? I'm portuguese and I never in my life heard about this, the only pontinha that I know is the place where you either go to buy drugs or be robbed. WTF this is so weird. Read a bit about it and it's actually kinda of cool, this type of tiny countries could be the future and the place for weird lawless servers and money paradises.

it's just a rock, they have a website and from the photos, it looks like that rocks that beaches have, but they made a some sort of castle, but the funniest thing is that it is so close to the shore, that I really think that you would think that's just a fort, like in guincho or something like that, it's funny to know this, I thought that this type of things just happened in other countries, but now we have our own stupid and kinda of amazing micro state.

Seriously? In the last year at least 3 banks failed in my country (EU). A state managed bank is on the verge too. Buying debt is a way better business today and the business model is simple, it's actually old Napoleon used this sneaky trick.  
  
1) Find reasons for a major holder of assets to enter in debt, it's in bad shape, you need a 100B loan, take it, say the EU economic stability people say, while getting incentives or while holding seats on the board of debt buying companies. EU loans the money to some bank that really didn't need it, puts massive interests, economy stagnates, bank fails, debt buying companies win and holdings hoarders too.

I didn't approve the CEO of my bank, but, if I fail to pay my house, they would get my house, simple. Why should they have to elect the person they owe money?   
  
P.S. I think Greece should just default and leave the euro, they always lived from internal economy, they don't export that much for europe (thing that I personally believe that it would grow) and just live their lives, with less mercedes, but more general quality of living. But I'm not even greek, I just wanted to see how it would be.

What are some good bitcoin escrow? I just know the common escrow.   
She/he has great feedback but I'm not feeling confident about the reasons to pay through bitcoin, instead of paypal.

Escrow would work fine. 1 grand is hard to trust like that. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 11:37:40
I can understand, but I'm filming the first time I look at the box and the condition of the box + the documentation attached. What about btcrow? I find the most similar to escrow.com and they are pretty known and used.

Hashnest if from antminer, how is it a scam?
@_date: 2015-10-21 11:45:07
The main thing that I don't understand is this formula: Unpaid principal (BTC) * 0.45 (satoshis per BTC per second) * time to find a block (seconds).   
  
@_date: 2015-10-21 13:32:48
Again, Hashnest is property and a service of Bitmain, the company that makes Antmine is probably the best seller on mining asics, I actually don't think they would shot themselves in the foot for half the revenues that they make, plus it doesn't need to be a ponzi for them to make money.  
  
Their product Antmine S7 costs to the client 1.283 BTC for TH/s, the cost of production has to be at least half the price what they are selling, so 0.64BTC, they sell 1Th/s for 1BTC, the only thing that I don't understand and actually that was what I wanted help is the profit formula.

Portugal and Spain are paying their debts, wtf is that title for?
