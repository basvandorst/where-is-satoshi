What if you get hacked?

I think you might be right, interesting! This might be only of the only ways to ensure a pension

Nope nope nope. The only way that it would result in less heat for the planet is if you convert the heat energy into some other permanent form of energy, like chemical energy. But a processor does not, a 100W processor generates 100W of heat!

Although if your family has some money problems, and the dad is coincidentally called satoshi nakamoto, and you claim to have lost your private keys, this would be a good way to get a lot of donations...

It's also limited to typically 4 years in europe. Fact is if you're not writing any papers, you're not letting people know about your work either so you are essentially wasting public money. It sounds pretty fair to me to be fired when you're not doing your job.

I agree that the academic system is a bit fucked up right now. I'm working in academia so I see both sides, but I don't really know how it should be fixed. It's not really about how long you can do a phd, but rather how universities decide which principal investigators (PI's) to hire and fire. 
In europe PI's are judged on how well they are able to publish in leading journals on short term, and how well they are able to get grant money. The journals promote half-ass science just to get a good headline, and the grants are basically about coming up with a plan that involves enough important people and buzzwords.

Right, this will surely make bitcoin more widely used.
@_date: 2014-04-07 21:44:09
Not directly. The people running the nodes need to agree with it and install any new bitcoin version that the developers come up with, so it's not like a single person has direct control.

I'm sure that didn't help her depression. It's crazy what governments can do and get away with.

I would like to see that they use proper testing, security, version control. That is something that went really wrong at gox.

Then you're going to give power back to single people/organizations. The whole advantage of bitcoin is that is doesn't depend on the actions of people.

In most of europe you get paid to do a phd. In the US you get a small stipend but not really enough to survive as I understand.
And the bachelor/master studies are heavily subsidized as well, think 2000 euro in a year instead of 30000$

The fact that we can't even pass segwit makes me worried about its future though. If Bitcoin is unable to evolve it will be superseded by something better

What happens if you refuse?

Where did you get the idea to short btc? 
@_date: 2016-09-03 06:08:41
As opposed to the US way of driving in your SUV while being surrounded by homeless people begging. I think I prefer the civilized european way.

Proof of work just needs to go

This would be great though, it means no speculation and people only buy what they use. I'm not convinced deflation is such a bad idea. We just need social systems to help unemployed, instead of pumping up economies for ever increasing gdp
@_date: 2019-09-19 11:22:33
Yeah I was just talking about fixed amount / deflationary currency. Indeed bitcoin doesn't scale up at all
@_date: 2015-10-22 12:18:34
It's a free market, they can ask whatever they want

He did a lot of coding. First it was just a cool concept and a running system... Then someone bought pizza and it turned into currency. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 10:27:02
Because we're all sharing the same database and have agreed on the rules of changing this database. 
Bitcoin transactions can only come from existing addresses or from mining blocks, and the blocks have a predefined amount of new currency when they are mined.
