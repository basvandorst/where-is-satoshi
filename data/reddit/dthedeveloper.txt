I doubt that my account specifically was flagged and my account wasn't closed because I live a relatively minimalistic lifestyle (I save/invest &gt; 50% of my income and besides eating out and moves I hardly make any purchases) but after my bank wouldn't transfer money to my exchange account I researched the issue online to find a lot of people who successfully transferred money into cryptocurrency exchanges and then their accounts were closed.

I am frugal and BoA just started charging maintenance fees so they were an option before but now I find it hard to rationalize starting an account for investing in Bitcoin when I'd be charged fees. But that is just me and my specific use case, I've heard a lot of great things about BoA.

Interesting. What security reasons are you talking about? Because I thought the purpose of not linking your bank account or buying it on a credit or debit card was to be anonymous... But I guess whenever you link your bank account you are essentially allowing another service or product initiate a transfer so if someone accesses your account they could initiate a transfer... With Utilities companies it doesn't matter much because what are they going to do, pay my bills for me? But with a wallet or exchange, they could trade or transfer my money elsewhere....
This is why Bitcoins and cryptocurrencies are intriguing to me in general. I have a background in computer science and security but love learning about new technologies and investing which is why I want to get back in on Bitcoin (may have missed my mark by a year or to lol).

I had ING Direct that was bought by Capital One and rebranded to Capital One 360.

Agreed. Although, since there is no fee for linking an account, I wonder if I could link my account and then do a transfer and then unlink it until I decide to invest more. Then if someone gains access to my exchange account the only thing they can get at is my Bitcoins and not my other account....

Good points. Yeah, I wouldn't necessarily be day trading but I would be trading relatively regularly as opposed to my stocks that I never sell and just buy and buy more dollar cost averaging on dips.

I had a simple account and when they did the switch over I didn't get the message so they mailed me a check for my balance (my fault, not theirs). Might have to reopen an account with them.
