Also, nobody is going to be paid or set long-term prices in Bitcoin as a *unit of account* in the near future. It would be crazy.
If anyone is paid in Bitcoin, it will be accounted in some other currency and then paid at the exchange rate in BTC.
There's no problem buying things with bitcoins if it's money you already were earning, because all one has to do is replace the BTC amount after the transaction with USD. However, it's true that if you have any other source of income, buying things with BTC you got from mining or speculation is not a good idea if you think the value will keep rapidly increasing.

Nothing "backs" Bitcoin (or dollars, for that matter). Backing is only an applicable term when you have a *paper currency* (or digital or whatever) which is exchangeable for a *fixed price* with a precious metal or with some other currency. For example, when a dollar was defined as 1/20th of an ounce of gold, the gold supply backed the paper dollars.
The U.S. government does not back the dollar. The European Union does not back the euro. Miners do not back Bitcoin.
What keeps the dollar valuable is the belief that the U.S. government will not rapidly increase the rate at which it prints more dollars. If it started to do so, or if the financial situation got so bad that it appeared that the government would have no choice but to do so, then you would get hyperinflation and collapse of the dollar.
What keeps Bitcoin valuable is the belief that the defined rate of bitcoin creation will be kept to, and that it will not be possible to break the code and spend others' bitcoins.
If you believe that the U.S. government will not hyperinflate, then the dollar is not a bubble. If you believe it will, then it is a bubble.
Similarly, if you think that the Bitcoin code is sound, it is not a bubble. If you believe it is unsound, it is a bubble.

You are exactly right. I said fractional reserve was possible. I didn't say it was a good idea.
That's why most economists who support the elimination of central banks and legal tender currency believe that people would not use fractional reserve banks apart from government incentives to do so: there's too much risk that they will go under.

Well, a lot changes in regard to ease of use. You *need* some kind of bank or mint to turn chunks of gold into coins and bills. You don't need a bank for BTC.
And because there is no central authority for BTC, it would be highly difficult to use the systems historically used by the government to prop up fractional-reserve banks. They can't print BTC, and while banks and governments could issue their own currencies backed by BTC and then dilute the ratio of currency to reserves, it's not clear why anyone would take these as payment when they could take "hard" BTC.

I agree with you that there is no philosophic meaning of intrinsic value.
However, the *monetary* meaning of intrinsic value is: does this item have a non-monetary value, or only a value insofar as it is used as money?
For example, cigarettes are sometimes used as currency. But their "intrinsic value" is to smoke. That is what makes them gain monetary value in the first place. However, like everything else, they have no philosophically intrinsic value.
That being said, there is no need for a currency to have intrinsic value. It helps adoption, but it is actually bad in the long run. Why? Because it means that a useful metal like gold is tied up sitting in vaults when it could be put into electronics, fountain pens, etc.

Of course. You cannot expect to borrow in Bitcoin-*denominated* amounts, or charge Bitcoin-*denominated* prices until and unless adoption stabilizes. That would be silly. But if Bitcoin were in the future to be adopted on an economy-wide scale, then you could easily issue loans in it.
Otherwise, you would obviously set prices in the dominant currency.
@_date: 2013-11-13 07:44:04




This is incredibly dumb and false. There are all kinds of reasons to borrow money.
For business, you want to borrow money when you believe that you can earn a rate of profit that is higher than the rate of interest.
For consumers, you want to borrow money when you need to make short-term expenses that you can't pay for out-of-pocket. Or when you are earning little or no money but rationally expect to be earning more in the future (such as when you're in college). Or when you need to buy a house or a car, so that you can use them while paying for them. You should not borrow recklessly, but that doesn't mean that you should never borrow at all.
The actual answer is that Bitcoin is not at all incompatible with loaning money. It is *not* deflationary. Deflationary means that the supply decreases. It does not. If it were deflationary, it would make loans impossible. But it is not. The fact that prices fall under a stable money because of increasing production does not make debts harder to repay: it is not the same as deflation.
Of course, you would be stupid to loan in Bitcoin-denominated terms now, because adoption is increasing rapidly, causing the price to fluctuate wildly.

I don't see how buying in bulk would make any more (percentage) profit. It still seems better just to put that large sum of money directly into BTC.
The only possible benefit I can see is that it might be hard to get around the daily deposit limits to put, say, $1 million in BTC.
@_date: 2013-10-28 16:59:15
You can't confuse "deflationary" in terms of price with deflationary in terms of money supply. The latter is legitimately harmful in that it harms debtors and stockholders and tends toward the collapse of the economic system.
"Deflation" in the sense of falling prices caused by increased production in a stable money is not harmful. It causes none of those bad effects.
However, the monetary deflation caused by people losing their wallets is insignificant. Once Bitcoin is valuable, people will not lose very much of it. The supply would have to shrink by a significant amount, say 1-5% to start causing bad effects.

So what? It doesn't matter if people "feel like" they're doing worse in their job or in business. They will not actually be forced to have a lower standard of living, or to go out of business.
If someone is working in a certain line of business that does not keep up with the average economic growth, then that worker will just have to take a pay cut. (Just as the business will have to accept that it will make less money.) But if there is economic understanding that the currency is not inflationary, the worker will no more resent that cut than a worker resents not getting a pay *raise* every year in an inflationary economy.
There can't be a "currency shortage" in a free economy, any more than there can be a shortage of anything else. If something is scarce, the price just rises.
@_date: 2013-04-05 03:42:55
There are two options: either you have a 100-percent reserve system, like many people here want, or you have what all banks are now, which is fractional reserve.
In a 100-percent reserve system, you only get interest on money that is actually put in a savings account and not immediately spendable. The bank takes this money and loans it out to someone else, hoping to make a profit and give you some part of that profit. The bank either has the money or it does not. There is no creation of what are called "fiduciary media".
If a Bitcoin bank operated on fractional reserve, you could deposit money there in a checking account and collect interest. The bank would give you a checkbook or debit card, and you could write checks to people as a promise to pay the bearer a certain sum of bitcoins, redeemable from that bank. The bank could even print notes which it promises to exchange for a certain number of bitcoins, just as private banknotes used to be backed by gold.
The catch is that this would operate on a system where the bank promises to back up a certain number of checking deposits and notes available for immediate withdrawal, but it does not actually have all of that money on reserve. It is only a *fractional* reserve. They lent most of it out to make interest on it. If every outstanding claim were called in at once, the bank would collapse, and its checks and banknotes would be worthless. These checks and banknotes are not basic money: they do not constitute final payment, but if the bank were sound they might be accepted as money. Then when the bank collapsed, they would be destroyed, causing the money supply to decrease.
If every bank operated on this principle, the whole banking system would collapse. Many "Austrian" economists believe that exactly this would happen if the government did not prop up fractional reserve systems. That is why they support 100-percent reserve banks.
Whether things are denominated in dollars or bitcoins makes no difference to the principles of the system. If you loan dollars to a bank or bitcoins to a bank, what you get in return is not "more dollars" or "more bitcoins" but a claim that the bank will pay you some if you ask for it. They don't come from anywhere: if the bank is running fractional reserve, it is just claiming that it is able to pay out much more that it actually has, and you may trade these claims with others.

Ironically, the pro-reason ones, the Mutazilites, were the hardest in pushing their "Inquisition" against the anti-reason ones.
For example, they forced people to swear that the Koran was a man-created document and not the eternal word of God. The more mystical Muslims wouldn't agree to that because they believed that the Koran somehow had always existed, even before Muhammad wrote it.

The same reason anyone would buy at $2 or $100...
If Bitcoin were to become widely used, its value would be much greater than $1000. Now, at a certain point, even if Bitcoin succeeds perfectly, it will reach a sort of equilibrium where it's not going to increase radically in value in the space of one year. Then people would buy for the same reason they buy gold or silver: as a hedge against inflation, not as a way to get huge returns.
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:20:27


No, people will buy and "hoard" until the value reaches some reasonable plateau. Once the market for Bitcoin is reasonably saturated, you can be confident that the value is not going to quadruple overnight.
At that point, the "hoarders" will be willing to sell their bitcoins for goods and services, or else to invest them in some project which will actually grow in value to a greater extent than slightly increasing adoption increases the value of Bitcoin.
It is a fallacy to assume that, because the price is so volatile now, it will continue to be as volatile in the future. We are now in the early adopter stage of Bitcoin. Compare it to something like Facebook. In the early days of Facebook, it was possible and common for the user base to quadruple in a month. But now, it is impossible for such a thing to happen. The price volatility of Bitcoin right now is caused by an extreme increase in adoption. When and if it reaches a saturation level similar to what Facebook has now, that volatility will disappear.
Currencies, in a free market, originate as stores of value. Their function as media of exchange develops as a result. That is exactly what we are seeing with Bitcoin. People are investing primarily because they see it as a store of value which is currently undervalued by the market. It also works as a medium of exchange, but it is currently primarily a means of exchanging *dollars*, not bitcoins, since prices are always denominated in dollars (or other fiat currencies), not bitcoins.

Yes, such "hording" would make no sense.
The only legitimate meaning of hoarding is a situation where people have to add more and more money to cash holdings with no fixed limit because investments are so poor and risky. That is harmful, because it reduces the velocity of circulation of money dramatically. But that only results from a situation such as war or a depression, which are caused by government.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:29:19
This is true. The thing to remember is that a rising value of money is not "deflation" in the traditional and sensible sense. Deflation, properly, is the destruction of the money supply, which occurs when fractional-reserve banks go under and the value of checking deposits is destroyed. Deflation in this sense is very harmful.
On the other hand, "deflation" caused by an increase of goods and services in the economy is not harmful. Most importantly, it does not favor creditors at the expense of debtors, since the debtors in the economy are part of the rising amount of goods and services, meaning that they produce more wealth to be able to pay off the higher real value of their obligations.
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:02:41


Sure, if everyone's preferences went immediately from 100% hoarding to 100% spending. But that is goofy. Obviously, the rate of adoption will slow down gradually, not all at once. And people will want to retain some significant cash holdings in Bitcoin.
Right now, if you think that Bitcoin is going to succeed, its valuation is too low. Therefore, you should hoard it because it will be worth a lot more in the future. When it approaches adoption saturation, then its valuation will be just the right amount. That doesn't mean you should dump everything you have. It just means that you should stop continuing to pile additional income into Bitcoin holdings.


Again, this would be true if the change in preferences were *sudden and drastic*, but we should rather assume that the velocity will increase gradually as adoption (and thus the rapid price increase) slows.


It has no *non-monetary* use, but this is not important. A non-monetary use can spur initial adoption of a currency, but it is not essential. For example, think of primitive rock and seashell money. It certainly does have many uses related to its monetary properties.


Fiat currencies, by definition, have no backing. A currency is "backed" by something if it can be exchanged for a commodity or for some other currency. For example, when the dollar was exchangeable for gold, the government's supply of gold was the "backing" of the currency. The only sense in which governments have anything to do with maintaining the value of their currencies is: a) by forcing people to accept them with legal tender laws, and b) by not printing too much additional currency.


Everything has monetary value only to the extent that people think it does. That is trivially true. Beanie Babies, assuming that one were seriously considering them as a currency, would have several disadvantages compared to Bitcoin:
* They are made by a private company which at any time could choose to produce additional Beanie Babies in any quantity. This is probably the most important criterion. Bitcoin's revolution was to have a decentralized model which could not be shut down at one source.
* Only a very few of the Beanie Baby models were truly scarce. Most of the rest were produced in large quantities.
* They can be "counterfeited" easily.
* There are quite susceptible to damage and wear which can seriously tarnish their value. Like diamonds (and unlike gold), their quality has a huge effect on the price.
* They are bulky to store and transport, and such storage and transportation presents many dangers that could destroy their value (fire, water damage, aging, etc.).

Obviously, loans would be a terrible idea right now because Bitcoin is not widely accepted as a currency.
Something is money in an economy when *everyone* wants as much of it as possible. That is not true yet of Bitcoin.
But in such a situation where Bitcoin reached full adoption (or at least the increase leveled off at a small level), the buying power of Bitcoin would not be continually increasing due to greater adoption alone.
Prices in Bitcoin would then only fall to the extent that there was more production. And then people would not have any problems paying back loans in Bitcoin, since their wages and/or profits would, on average, stay the same even while prices were falling.

As I said above, gold has no philosophically intrinsic value. (I am an Objectivist, and I agree with Ayn Rand's statement quoted above that nothing has such intrinsic value.)
However, gold does have intrinsic value in the *monetary* sense. This only means: it has value apart from its role as money. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has no value apart from its role as money.
Intrinsic value can help a currency gain adoption. For example, cigarettes are often used as currency. People initially hoard them because they want to smoke (this is the intrinsic value). But since they are so desired, even non-smokers accumulate them to trade for things they do want. Then, on top of the non-monetary intrinsic value, the cigarettes gain monetary value.
That being said, there is no need for a currency to have intrinsic value, and it can actually be harmful in the long run. Take the cigarette example. If everyone is using cigarettes as money, they will be far too valuable to smoke. Or if a 100% reserve gold standard were adopted, no one would be able to use gold for things like fillings, electronics, and fountain pen nibs.
