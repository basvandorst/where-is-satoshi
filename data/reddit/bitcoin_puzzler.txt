Yea, i still believe that actually an psychology degree would be more valuable than an economy degree if you want to do anything with finance/investing related. 
The insights in the human brain probably give you that perfect edge to become way better than most peers.

I don't know where you live, but here do not 5% of the street walkers die every year. Nice to compare the two, isn't it! Maybe now you get a better graps of the dangerous inflation. I have no rights in the people i elect as i live under a self elected EU government which we voted against many times but that doesn't matter of course. Besides that i doubt that there is any country in the world where the people can elect the people in power of the money supply (central banksters).


Yes, i understand. It is a false believe though which you have learned somewhere (probably in a state funded school).


You really just described any system in the world in any period of time. Or you argue that in the west the millenials now are better off then the babyboomers (besides of course all the innovations we indeed profit more/longer off then most babyboomers).

I said that banks are giving a guaranteed loss. If you invest in bitcoin just as a deversified strategy of your total investment there isn't really much risk. Or you can take another investment approach and that is taking 1-10% of your net worth in bitcoin and the rest in cash. You certainly outperform cash with very low risk. 


Exactly, you advise me to go into the Euro, which for me inflates at 3.x% a year. And that is the official number, lets not even talk about the real inflation. That is not a low risk is it?




You mean in stocks? Which the government has been propping up for ten years by now? Yea, no risk to be seen here indeed!


Once again, not true. Read more about history i would say.

Triggered much?
I meant odds, as you still find it likely somehow that bitocin may fail.
If you meant not to bet the house on it you should have said that. Mortgaging your house for bitcoin is something else then threat it as a casino (which should be like $100 fun night out or something). There is a very big gap between the two, don't you agree?
"Willing to lose" is a vague concept, lets not even go there.


Yes so let's be clear on that, i agree. And the less someone knows about bitcoin they should put in less money.


I am at a for me comfortable level of risk taking and exporse to bitcoin. It is way higher then i would in any other investment, but yet not 100%. There is a big difference between making a well thought investment in which you highly think you are gonna succeed and go all in. (The later one is still perfectly fine in some situations).

How short term? I understand that you want to be controversial and that is a smart move as an investor.


Not really agreeing with you on this part. Sure markets are often price things wrongly. But altcoins didn't bring much value or did they? The market just start to price them more fairly.
Look you are more like saying now that the market is pricing petsdotcom or worldonline wrongly and the market will change. Surely the market was wrong about the whole tech market in the early 2000. But i highly doubt that you will pick out the few winners in the alt coin market. Sure you can try, but the likelyhood you will succeed is imo very small (hence we say alts will die and just go for bitcoin). But proof me/us wrong!

Lmao, watch the video again. The difference between a car insurrance and a bank insurance is that it will come all at once (in a financial crisis). While only a well known percentage of car owners will crash in the next 12 months. All banks run on the same ponzi scheme and if one goes the next goes as well (hence the need for a government "insurance"). 
There isn't even a real insurance policy btw. It is just a government liability paid by tax payers. Of course they can pay it as it just means more money needs to be printed.

I think mainly because other central banks just keep acting weird. Just look at the ECB and Bank of Japan. They just keep stimulating the markets well into a bull market. And there even plans from the ECB to again start stimulus programs. So basically he has no other choice then to again start participating in new currency wars.

It is not a stock, it is an open source code/protocol everyone can work on. Also it is not a stock as in sense that there is only one not thousands like stocks, more like gold, that there is only 1 metal which is values as gold does (silver too historically, but that mostly lost its usecase by now).
But we can't really compare bitcoin to anything as it is just something new. It is a protocol, it can be money, it can be (digital) gold, it can be so much things at once.. And it is already and it will only increases more as time progresses.


No and he shouldn't, many creators of big companies dump their stocks... 


Aaah come on, the world is full of such schemes, especially in the USA with even the SEC watching. Bitcoin is unregulated, so it settles everything by itself. The price will reflect it like how a free market should operate. If you don't bleieve in that, you shouldn't be in bitcoin. And sure, people will abuse such powers to create more wealth for themselves. Like even in our tens of thousand year history has been done so.
How many actually went t jail for Libor fraud? And when i get my money back for the losses i realized through that? NEVER!


Thank you, i see that you don't fully get bitcoin yet. I would suggest you to read more. Watch some videos from Andraes Antonopoulos.
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:49:31
I think to truely graps on the how/why bitcoin can potentionally reach those levels you need to look not necessarily into bitcoin, but understand the market in general. 
Learn about gold, fractional reserve, (central) banking, fiat currencies, RE, stocks, interest rates, inflation etc. Even if it is just an extreme insurrance, 200B is still nothing. There are so many ways it could distrupt it is even hard to see the eventually value, it can easily be that those targets you write down are still low valued.

Not true, bitcoin works regardless of what fiat price you give/value it. It works as good at $1 (outside of the security through mining) as it does on $1 million.
That we can store something and come back at it later is tremendously valuable to a human society. That is why we reached so far as we are today.

Also those small bets wouldn't be that important anymore. Let say you bet the same as in the casino: $100, now bitcoin reaches the gold market cap. Congratz you made $3400 of your original $100. Nice gains, but i think bitcoin can do you one better.

Yes technology improvements take a long time to really been used as normal.
Humans are afraid of change and would rather have everything the same. The ironic part is that when you take it away when they just got used to it they become very angry.
I think we all do fall for it in some way though, it is just how we are wired. Look at some videos of Tim Draper or Peter Thiel, i think few people do actually even understand their vission. It is just out of reach for most people to even gasp those new ideas.
Anyway, i do think for people to store their wealth into this new online tech thing it is even going to take longer. Booking a hotel or signing up on Facebook is one thing. Giving all your wealth to trust in this tech is a whole different level of dedication.

Wait till you reach the point where you are not worring about getting enough money. But on to the point about how to protect the money. That is where bitcoin actually thrives.
If bitcoin goes where i think it is going you can't have enough. Besides that you need to look out at other investments as well. You shouldn't have much fiat, bonds are a certain no no. Stocks are pretty okay but very pricy right now. Gold probably is okish, but is more as a hedge/insurrance then a real investment. Real Estate are anybodies worst nightmare.
Bitcoin is the answer against all the extreme debts, probably rising inflation while they try to keep all interest earning potential very low (In the eu for example the interest rates are at zero, the inflation is at 1-3.5% and the bond yields are negative..).

Because basically only bitcoin has value. Altcoins is all pure hopium they have some "money" in a shitcoin and they hope one day it will be worth a lot. But as soon as they try to cash it out the price will tumble.
But as long  as shitcoiners don't really cash out it just follows the btc price (the price is coupled with btc pair). But as you can see that the dominance is falling hard, it shows you that behind the scene people are cashing out on their alts. They simply switch it back in btc. But it happens on a slow scale, so most altcoiners just don't (want to) notice the slight losses they make.
You even see alt coiners saying things like satoshi gains/losses doesn't matter. I am up in fiat. But if they bought bitcoin instead of shitcoin they would have had more gains. So basically they "lost", as they failed to match the benchmark.

What is there to understand? You say you do fully understand bitcoin and where it is going?
Many of those people/companies can't even throw money at it as it is not legal for them to do so right now. So first they need to fully understand it. Then they need to start building/making things legal (some parties are at that stage) and then the money get thrown against it. 
Imagine if some big insurance or pension fund starts to stack 1% of their assets into bitcoin.

Buying $100 is not so few, but don't waste it! Be frugal (looks like you are, its a good thing!). But make sure that you understand what you invest in and don't make the risks bigger then needed.
I do think bitcoin is/will be a great investment. But it is really risky (okay maybe not that much, but you can lose a lot if something happens or you trade your own money away).
But there are great youtube videos/books/docu's etcs! Try to learn things from those people, as thre is countless of wonderful (free) info around.

I read the latest Dutch central bank report. It was written there that house prices directly correlate with spending. When house prices fall people start to save more. The GDP rises by something like 0.3% for every 1% in houseprice inflation.
So the government/central bank really argues that this "wealth effect" is succesful. Let them think they are rich on paper and they start spending more money. Hence the endless QE programs.
All this fake money economy pumping will end very badly imo when reality strikes.

It matters.
As it is a whole lot harder to make wars when you have a hard currency in opposite to an easy printable USD bill. Take a look in the past how empires failed during one war too many. And how the US gov can easily fund another 5 wars as long as the world keeps the same system.

I also have still some LTC (left from arbitrage). But i just hold it and sell it for fiat when the price is right (just to get some "gainz", instead of having to sell bitcoin).

Yes technology basically is deflationairy. A perfect example is light. Just a hundred years ago it costed a small fortune to enlighten your house. 
Nowadays it cost almost nothing and even the poorest of the west have zero problems enlighten their house ten times better all day long.
Also deflation is not the dooms day forecast as some economist say it is. Look at you, you are from Germany. They strive ever to make better products for a lower cost so that more people can afford it. 
This create superiour products who boosts the economy as simply no one in the world can compete with that. So it is a net benifit for everone.
While inflation might temporary boost but mainly drives bad business incentives.

What i trying to say is, when your country runs a 10% inflation a month it doesn't matter what the MM ratio says. The only thing you think about is how the f i get money out of my fiat currency.
There are already many high inflation or at least at high risk countries in the world. That is many billions of fiat at potential risk. Add some risk for safety, hiding from negative interest rates etc and you get to crazy MM levels.

Not really. He prints money and can spent it on whatever he wants, gov bonds like in the EU for example. Then yes the USA suffers as the dollar gets weaker, but a weaker dollar means more export which actually improves USA i would guess.
That's why some central banks love to print a shit ton of money (if they have an exporting economy). Look at Swiss, they can print money like crazy as there is demand for Francs, with this printed money they buy real assets like US stocks, the currency falls, export keeps working well. It's really a win -win -win for them.
@_date: 2019-07-21 21:44:31
Why you think so?
If i don't trust a LN custodial i send my bitcoin back to my own trusted wallet. So you can still fight the banks with a LN custodial service. Without bitcoin you can't easily opt out of banks nor the dollar. 
If you put $50 of your bitcoin stack your decentralized money suddenly becomes centralised? 
Paypal is just a processor. They aren't really that bad, neither good with their blood sucking fees and random account bans. But they are about the only option in their space so they have all the power. 
LN could certainly compete there, even if it is with a "custodial" service.

That's a good thing. Now we have hardware wallets and other easy ways to store bitcoin. Future bankrupcies will include new/better ways to store and exchange bitcoin. 
Some people learn it upfront, others learn after they lost money.
True, it might not be so easy to get coins (quickly) out of an exchange. That is some of the risks while storing them there.
And government regulation are inevitable i suppose. Sure i don't like them, but they will be enforced in one way or another anyway. To be honest i find the current approachs from governments to bitcoin really lacking any strength and security. It looks like they don't really know how to do it right now.

The book: "The Bitcoin Standard" from author Saifedean Ammous - it will give you a better understanding of what money is!
If you really got into it this far, there is another great source to entertain yourself even longer!: 
Also just buy firstly a small amount of bitcoin to start with and learn more about it (10$ is already plenty!). Buy it on an exchange to see how that works. 
Then just send it to your wallet, Electrum wallet for example. Send it around a bit to get to know bitcoin and how it works, 
learn about how the transaction fees for sending a transaction work:  . Make for example a small donation to wikileaks  to get some experience.

Bitcoin is build to not need any permission from a goverment, or whoever else.
Look at the torrent community to get an idea of how bitcoin will work. They simply can't block/ban/break it. Neither torrents nor bitcoin.

If you count gambling on the future as gambling, sure then i am so. If you truly understand the financial system and its counterpart the dollar you price bitcoin in, i'm gambling if i am not in bitcoin..
Keeping it in banks/paper/whatever is way more risky then you might realize.

Sure i agree. But bitcoin has multiple layers and could easily compete, so if it can, why shouldn't we?
I agree that it is not the main thing bitcoin should do. But it is something to keep in mind. A network all around the world were they accept bitcoin only makes it stronger. 
It is not the main thing why i like bitcoin though. But there should be a payment system imo, it doesn't matter if it is through 2nd layer like LN.

Sure they are powerful and rich. I didn't meant that they are nothing. But they can hardly dicate the future from here on.
If it wasn't for the shitty euro/EU union, the EU would be a strong force right now. Asia is becoming much much stronger in the next decades. They simply crush USA.
So it is more likely that we will see another ruler of the world in the coming decades. America's biggest advantage right now are the dollar and its capitalistic system (the stockmarket). But most big stocks are international powerhouses and they would switch countries in a hard beat. And the USD well it would fail eventually like all other big currencies did in history..

Kind of but not really. Banks/custodials will exist also with bitcoin. And that is good because not everyone can or wants to hold those responsibility.
There are two majors differences, coinbase could cryptographically proof that they hold your coins (but they aren't right now). So than it is much less likely chance that such parties run a fractional reserve.
And the other thing is that is is much easier to always take possession of your bitcoin compared to fiat. Banks made it almost impossible to run away from them and when the masses do it is over in seconds.

Banks hold your money onto their books for a while so they can gain interest or just make their books a little better (a better reserve ratio). You should definetely talk to your bank ans ask if they can stop this madness, if not try to find a better bank.
As long as the exchange didn't receive the fake cash (fiat money), they will not let you send hard cash (bitcoin) out of course, that would be very stupid!
To be clear, if i sent a SEPA wire to coinbase it arrives in 2-4 hours on a business day, so i can buy and send the bitcoin away without any problems.

You could DCA or buy it at once (depends on where you see the price going in short term).

It is though. Higher acceptance is a good thing. It makes those who want to spend their bitcoin more easily/attractive to do so. That mastercard/visa is accepted everywhere is a good thing, not a bad thing. Or do you dissagree? If more businesses accept bitcoin it brings new liquidity. The USD is were it is today because it is used all around the world, everyone knows/trust its value. If no one really would accepted it, it wouldn't be half as useful.

There later is true as millions of bitcoin are stored on exchanges and custodial wallets...

Both. I would say the minimum is 1% diversification. And if you understand bitcoin better you can go wild on that number.
Bitcoin is a potential way higher returing asset. But fair enough it could "fail". It will be most likely an all or nothing bet. Or we keep believing in it and it keeps growing rapidly, or it fails and we lose money. Not so different then stocks after all, but stocks have a money printing machine behind it keeping those assets always up from falling to zero.

Of course it is used as a hedge, slowly more and more people starting to see it and feel more comfortable with it.
But i think the prices you compare are just random. Bitcoin is so young, so small. A single buyer/seller could f up your comparison. So i think in the near future we can't really see much comparison with anything. Which makes it actually a perfect hedge against everything. The ultimate insurrance, which comes darn cheap imo.

It ended up being wayyy too oversold. No sellers left anymore at anyprice, so the price bounced back to a level were more buyers/sellers find their exchange. I and many other traders anticipated on this to happen. Most of us didn't really would see it happen this quick/fast. But it was pretty obvious to me actually.
I would suggest you to read the intelling investor from Benjamin Graham to get a better understanding of "why". Especially his mr market concept/chapter is pure gold.


It is not strange at all, many people were waiting for it to bottom, others were heavily investing in it on the way down. Till the point that all sellers are left, price starts to rise, people are still uncertain. Accumulation keeps going strong after spikes. People start to finally panic and get back in (at a much higher cost than they could easily pick up bitcoin earlier for, but hey greed never leaves us).
Oh btw, i highly recommend you to watch this guys videos:
He basically already shown months back that we were bottoming at 3-4k and that the price likely started to rise again (also he didn't see the strengt in it, but the correct direction is key).

Easy to use i would say.
It is a lot harder to install and safely use bitcoin (with storying the seed etc). Then it is to rely on your bank and call them when you forget your password or lost your bank card.
Look at in a way as to let your parent/uncle/aunt who is not good with tech or even current online banking, how you can let them use bitcoin and still feel okay with them to use it? I would have nightmares if my parents would have/use bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-07-31 08:49:19
It can be both ways. But most likely it will be a lot higher. And i mean ALOT!
Because when the price starts to rise, many would rather hold on to their bitcoin, so it rises faster than the amount of buying (there are no sellers so price just goes up without any transaction).
That is why we suddenly have 20-100% gains in bitcoin. There is simply no sellers left to sell at for example $5k. So price moves a lot higher in short term without really much (extra) trading.
Let say 2 trillion $ really wants to enter the bitcoin market. There isn't even the slighest imagination where the price then would be. Certainly not at "just" 120k. Probably more like 10x that, if not higher.

​It is a believe system and they don't believe in it.
They have their money tight in other assets like stock, bonds, funds and RE.
They have their wealth actually in businesses who generate income which they then invest again.
Most millionairs are millionair on paper not in fiat. They don't have 1 milllion USD to invest, they have assets worth 1 million USD. They became rich with the later, so why they would sell.

I liked bitcoin initially. Downloaded the wallet, run my own node. Checked about mining, did send some bitcoin around. (Not much and i have no clue anymore how i got them in the first place, probably those free satoshi programs).
Then pretty much left it aside, mining wasn't really profitable in my country and those mining rigs were often not even send or too late. 
Problem i had with it was that i really though the government would burn this thing to the ground early on. And that people not really would "fall" for it (many small currencies have been created around the globe over the years).
But the value kept going up. I rechecked and started research more and pretty much fell directly down the rabbit whole. Previous concerns were proven wrong.
@_date: 2019-07-03 08:22:06
It's doable, it is already been done in some cases.
Trying to sell to small shops will be the hardest i guess (tell them it saves in tx fees), and it is yet to be seen if it really give them extra sales or even any sales at all.
Some small shops have accepting bitcoin/LN and for sure thrived on it as they use it as a clever marketing trick. Look up  
@_date: 2019-07-01 19:44:54
ffs, you really aren't the brightest are you?
Bitcoin will be the worlds currency in maybe the next 2-5 decades. Until then it will be volatile and it will  keep taking more value from fiat over time. It doesn't become a stable shitcoin overnight..
If someone has a problem paying with bitcoin while it is volatile, hedge yourself (this gets done with billions on fiat on a daily business as international trading has exactly the same problem as you describe...).
@_date: 2019-07-08 23:17:46
Maybe try a website like localbitcoins.com ?
@_date: 2019-07-08 16:30:18
I understand the scarcity. And that few want to sell and hodl on.
But there always people who sell (for whatever reasons). It might be that someone just buys at 100k to sell at 110k. Or someone needs the money for bread. Or a house, or a funeral.
Sure this doesn't change the direction bitcoin is going (which is up), but i meant there will be a market as long there are fiat currencies around the world.
And for the forseable future it is unlikely that we throw all fiat currencies out.
Anyway, i'm glad that people in Arg or Ve can safe themselves with bitcoin!

No the market stays liquid. But the price reflects the point were people are willing to sell.
A couple a months ago no seller was to be found at $3-4k anymore, so here we are now at $10k. If the demand at $1m is high and the sellers dry up the price will go higher.

Sure. When a fiat hyperinflates (very likely if bitcoin really succeeds), things do get messy. Look at historical hyperinflated currencies.
Those were often individual cases though, now imagine if just the EURO and USD start to hyperinflate. Things can really get ffed up imo. Maybe it will be a slow transitioning from fiat to bitcoin, but i am not sure yet.
Tech is improving so rapidly right now that it truely is amazing. The things you see from selfdriving cars, almost fully automated containershipping terminals, Amazon, GPS driven tractors, and thousands of other improvements. This is going in such a rapid rate right now that it do scare me a little. As more and more workers are just becoming obsolete. And the power of those robotization isn't shared equally, far from it even.
Now imagine if the bottom 50% of the people are getting it very difficult to find and keep switching for fewer and fewer jobs. And i am not even talking here anymore about low skilled jobs either. Think bankers, doctors, surgeons and many other high skilled workers too.

I do try it for fun sometimes on Bitmex (so that my fees are not eating all the profits anyway). You would be surprised how unsuccesfull it is. 
Even when you do follow some "traders".
If you want to make more money through trading i would advice you to learn to really buy low and sell high (Warren Buffett style). Or like Benjamin Graham, but even that is extreme hard to do. Because really when bitcoin is really low and when bitcoin is priced high (that it doesn't go higher).
One book or at least chapter i would recommend you to read. The intelligent investor from Benjamin Graham. He describes the market perfectly well in psycological terms. "Mr market", but even when you know how it works we humans still fall as victim for the market. Our brain is just programmed in such way i suppose.

Even if the price doesn't rise they sell. I think they dumped around half a billions USD worth of tokens alone this year. They have so many created tokens left that they don't even care. They just need the money, if the price is not 60 cents but 30 cents they just double their token dump.

Actually it is even good when there is just more bouncing between USDT&lt;&gt;BTC.
The more liquidity the better bitcoin will be.
Lots of fake data about volume and weird exchanges. But for example CMC totally ignores bitmex, which i think isn't really fair. Sure bitmex is a speculative market, but it provides real trading volume IMO. Lots of USD&lt;&gt;EUR trading is done in exact the same way as bitmex does it.

True. I don't really know how it will go.
I lived in a high inflation country for a while (20%+) and actually everything still surprisingly worked well. Maybe due to the fact that they had a stable currency in the background to rely on (USD/EUR).
I think those cases you talk about are interesting, but also not really a great to watch them. As they have less knowdlegde and are used to live under a more dictatorial regime. But the fact that those people do grap onto bitcoin all the more shows that the whole idea/system works. And when a lot of people start to step into the new system things go bonkers. (hyperinflation of eur/usd i wouldn't totally exclude).

The reason i know finance/economy is why i bitcoin... Thanks for the heads up.


Inflation is at 3.5% here, capital tax at 1.5% and interest is just 0.03%. So to hodl my euros in the bank it cost me a mere 4.97% a year. And the banks mainly loan the money out to finance our crazy housing system, not businesses.

You are on the right path my friend!
Here some quick advice to not only spent money on bticoin but also some time (trust me it is facinating!).
Some quick information about some good sources, it is best to do your own research.
 - great videos to give you a good understanding of what bitcoin is. Highly recommend it to watch at least some of his conferences.
The book: "The Bitcoin Standard" from author Saifedean Ammous - it will give you a better understanding of what money is!
If you really got into it this far, there is another great source to entertain yourself even longer!: 
Also just buy firstly a small amount of bitcoin to start with and learn more about it (10$ is already plenty!). Buy it on an exchange to see how that works. 
Then just send it to your wallet, Electrum wallet for example. Send it around a bit to get to know bitcoin and how it works, 
learn about how the transaction fees for sending a transaction work:  . Make for example a small donation to wikileaks  to get some experience.

Plus the price you pay for your bank account. The low interest/zero interest you get. Or any other redicilous fees.
Sending money in the tradional way is hardly free. Together with my business account and creditcard i pay like 250$ a year in fees (not even counting the no/bad interest here). That's a shitload of bitcoin transactions :p

Of course, that's the whole idea of an inflationairy system. Everyone becomes a (debt) slave and need to ever work more/harder.


Exactly. Isn't it a beauty? Everybody works there asses off. They even think they are free! They even compete with each other! Yet they fail to see that they are more enslaved then an African chained worker on American fields some hundred years ago.


Uhm that's how the capitalistic system works as well. Or you really find someone having ownership of the company really doing 10.000.000 x the work of their employeed slaves?


No it is not. And here you can really see that the current system f*cked up your thinking. Tell me how something like Wikipedia, or bill gates at microsoft, or Elon Musk gets incentivised to work? You think it is the money. That the money makes the world go round. But why then Elon gives away his pattents for free to just create more electrical cars? Why bill gates didn't stop after he had a couple million dollar and jsut enjoyed the fruits of his labour? Heck he does still more for the world then you and i combined. Why random people go in their evening adding things to Wikipedia? They even donate money to it! All for just the freedom of knowledge!
Your thinking is wrong as you just think the world in a way that the world can only work in a debt inflationairy system. Why then many EU socialist countries can provide a better live then in America? Money clearly isn't always the best way. But we are still far from an real idealistic world, that i have to agree with you, we still need some slaves to get some work done.

Yes because bitcoin inflates already less then major fiats, thats why bitcoin has already deflation (deflation in purchasing power). But people do choose bitcoin over fiat because it is already inflating less/harder/deflationairy. 
Maybe not the best way to show indeed, but a harder money is likely to become worth more, hence the same 0% interest isn't intersting in the same way, any well thinking person would take bitcoin over fiat.


Totally agree with you. It is a self fullfilling prohecy. Pretty genius actually. Start with high supply issuance and make this worthless coin spread quickly and then ever slowing down the inflation rate so people start to hoard them and the endless circle begins.
@_date: 2019-07-16 12:41:22

It will be scarcer over time.
Right now every day 1800 bitcoin is mined (6*12.5*24). So every day $17 million worth of bitcoin is added. That means every month half a billion of fresh usd gets invested into bitcoin (just to stay stable).
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:13:23

How's the brainwashing going so far?
But tell me honestly. Did you ever postpone to buy a smartphone for two years because it will be a lot better compared to the price (deflationary)?

It doesn't really matter much. It is likely helpful as the "stock" is less then we think. But we can't really estimate how much. As not all lost coins are actually lost.
The good thing compared to gold is that gold might be lost by its owners, but it will likely be found again and added to the stock. (Think about roman coins for example).
While if bitcoin was burned by a roman citizen it is gone forever. Making it even more scarce overtime.

Lagarde in a IMF paper even argues that you can make a second currency so that paper can be set to lower prices. You would see in the supermarket a 1$ ecash bread and a 1.03$ cash bread (basically every year the exchange rate between the two will move further with the level of inflation).

Yea it was. And the problems who are now known about 10 years are still not fixed. It is a shitshow on purpose.
@_date: 2019-07-29 19:04:09
I understand you. This is a "problem" indeed. It is not really a problem, but i understand your worries.
Bitcoin is volatile, so what companies can do is accepting bitcoin and directly convert it to their local fiat. Same as i can buy a Big Mac in America and my euros are converted at point of sale to USD. I don't want the dollars, they don't want the euro's, yet we do business.
This will bring liquidity to the network, which will make it stronger. So even those retailers who don't directly are involved in bitcoin but convert it still help us out.
As for volatility from businesses point of view, it is really not interesting for them to hold it indeed. It is too volatile, and you wish no one working in such a way. We as speculators/investors need to reduce the volatility by agreeing all that one bitcoin is worth xxx. But likely it will take one/two decades before bitcoin is more stable then Eur/usd.

Another great example is lightning. 100 Years ago it cost a fortune for 1 hour of light, now it cost like 2 pennies.

Because it is what it is today. We can't predict the future of those fees as it is still not totally clear how we will scale. Maybe LN will work and we can easily see high fees on chain to validate millions of transactions on lower chains. But this is still very hard to even work out how things go. Let alone predict what the fees will be for it in the future. 
Maybe people want to pay their coffee with LN, maybe bitcoin never really will be used for payments in general, who knows?
And yea i missed the "sarcasm" as these same wrong fees are told time and time again by very shrewd scammers. Even when we haven't seen really high fees for 18 months, it still is being told on a daily basis.
One thing we can be sure about though, bitcoin never really will scale as a massive payment system (first layer) which is used world wide for daily transactions by billions. Because that will brake about any other characteristic of what bitcoin is/does.

You can't print money and create inflation. Do you even know how it works? 
In the EU for example they haven't even created that much inflation after all the printing. As most of the money just went into assets (asset inflation). The money didn't go into the economy and velocity of money decreased.
And it is all just a whole hard game they play. You can't put the printer on 2% inflation and that will create 2% inflation, how do you think it works?

You would rather let me sell my bitcoin at an exchange, send it to my bank account. Exchange it to yen's, give it to the camera shop. Finding out i have too many yen's so i need to convert back yen.
Then just a camera shop that accept bitcoin and uses a 3th party processor who takes a fee (which likely is less then the first route)?
The camera shop has a low margin business, of course they are not going to hold a highly speculative/volatile bitcoin. They have real bills to pay at the end of the month (in Yen).

Exactly, i have much the same thoughts! But i started investing as well. It worked out great, but i understand that most of those "returns" are also just due to their printing and has little to do with real companies results.
Inflation rates and interest have big influence on stock/asset prices. Its really crazy if you think about it. And more and more i get the idea they perfectly well know what they are doing. They intent to destroy the economy and reap the profits on anything how they seem fit.


Indeed. To be honest i think the moment it really catches fire and people understand how to move away from  inflation and like the adoption we end up with hyperinflation. The fake money and extreme debts can't really last much longer i suppose.
@_date: 2019-07-15 17:02:03
And when the gig tickets are priced at for example double the price, some people rather take the money then going. So supply increases at a higher price (more/new people who are willing to sell).
@_date: 2019-07-02 08:43:00
Because the flow because half as much as of today. 
Read more about stock to flow concept, it is really intersting.
Basically if you take gold, gold is very valuable not because it is shiny, not because it is heavy, or yellow, or a good conductor, nor because you can make jewelery out of it. Gold is valuable because at the moment we simply can't make more of it. How hard we try, how much money we throw at it. If we want more gold, we have to wait. Sorry if i am wrong, but i guess the gold stock to flow ratio is about 50. This means that for every gold bar/jewerly etc in existance, this year there will be found 2% more. (100/50), so that is like a 2% inflation rate. Which is basically the lowest inflation rate in anything you can find, so people start hoarding gold (since like forever) as no one can make more of it. Because there is more demand than supply prices goes up.
Bitcoin S2F currently is around ~25 [total coins 17,800,000 / ( 1800 new coins a day * 365)] So when the halving is, the daily newly coins drop to 900, which then gives it a S2F of around 50. Which is similar to that of gold!
When the demand of bitcoin stays the same, and the price stays exactly the same, this means that for every dollar going after bitcoin there is now only 900 new coins a day instead of 1800.

Don't worry. We all need to learn. Everyone makes mistakes in investing, just learn from it and stay humble. Learn from it, see it as an education payment. But don't make the mistake again as that would surely hurt the investments overal.
The good thing with the internet is that you can easily learn from other peoples mistakes. (And winnings). Spent time on learning and reading as much as you can. You soon will start to understand why we love bitcoin so much as well and explain it to other people.
Many alt coin investors stay at the same place you are right now, they don't really get it. They put 50 buck in x or y. They lose left or right. They just wait and hope that things will magically fall in their way. 99.99% of the altcoin gains is just because they ride on bitcoin. It is all hype and marketing, you will see few successful alt investors who agree with that, but it is the hard reality.

Torrents as in they are unstoppable. Whatever a country or company wants.
Governments can make bitcoin illegal, but that wouldn't stop bitcoin. Much like you can get every drug pretty much around the globe, while no governments allow them. If bitcoin becomes illegal, it certainly slows down things. But there will be an even more rezilient system, because the blockchain just keeps running. And we always find ways to buy bitcoin. It may evne add to the desire, as a lot of things which are illegal are very tempting by many people.
Banks are already disrupting themselves. Even now with all the automation they can't get their own businessmodel straight. As soon as more people will go for hard cash (gold/bitcoin), which both are already havily in demand. Then the bankers businesmodel will fail and more people will run for bitcoin.

The whole idea of gold is that it beats inflation. Which it hardly does (no wonder, central banks have no interest in letting gold succeed above their shitcoin).

Lagarde will work for the ECB. She comes from the IMF (an organisation who "fixes" broken countries). The perfect person to "fix" the broken EU model.
She indicated that a negative 3% interest might be a good idea to stimulate the economy. They even went so far with their crazy ideas as creating a different cash fiat so that your bank just can take 3% of your account from your e-euro. But if you take money out of the bank those cash bills will become worth less 3% every year. (Two currency system basically, where next year a bread cost 1 e-euro or 1.03 cash euro).
To make a negative interest effective you firstly need to cut of most/all runaways. So they are heavily marketing a ban on cash. The bank laws are tidden so that it gets harder (or even impossible) to get out of a bank. High fees for cash deposit/withdrawals. 
Lower cash limits for spending to prevent "laundering". Making it harder for private people to invest in gold (for example, last year i could buy 10k euro worth of gold before they would inform authorities about the payment, today that will be at 3k euro).
And the list goes on and on.

You are confused here. It is actually not the exchange that holds your money, the exchange is simply waiting for your bank to send the money over to them. This can take up days and sometimes even weeks.
Banks hold your money onto their books for a while so they can gain interest or just make their books a little better (a better reserve ratio). You should definetely talk to your bank ans ask if they can stop this madness, if not try to find a better bank.
As long as the exchange didn't receive the fake cash (fiat money), they will not let you send hard cash (bitcoin) out of course, that would be very stupid!
To be clear, if i sent a SEPA wire to coinbase it arrives in 2-4 hours on a business day, so i can buy and send the bitcoin away without any problems.

Just print ourselves too riches! Of course it can't work. But thanks to the crazy money printing skills of our Italian friend the whole eur interest market is heavily disturbed.


You indeed have a mortgages and get paid to hold one. Sounds interest at first sight. But the downside is that the house prices are through the roof of course. So your mortage has a positive return but is way to high in principal.
You pay for the "asset" one way or the other, don't worry about that. The crash will also be harder, let say interest rises back to 3%, this means people can afford way lower mortages, which puts maximum pressure on sales.
Everything is in this way to pump the market forever. Works pretty well for now, only the fall will only get bigger.

I totally agree. That's why i start more and more to think that we are in the end part of this deadly spiral. It might work still a bit longer. But everything get soo out of proportions/control. 
Maybe bitcoin will be the pin that burst this whole bubble. To be honest i don't see our world going back to gold. They rather just expience with some SDR are or other global like currency.
The problem may lay in that money/interest/fract banking isn't really true open/free market. So they just central plan a "free" market.

Bitcoin right now isn't working perfectly for short term commerce (short term storeing value).
Bitcoin is still volatile and likely stays this way until the prices is way higher and we reached equilibrium in price point. This can happen in the next couple of decades, but until then compared to fiat bitcoin likely stays volatile on short term basis.
In the long run indeed bitcoin's price likely rises as new supply decreases rapidly while the demand stays the same or even grows. This makes that many people speculate indeed on the price. But this only works for long term. We can speculate with a higher certainty where the price in 5 years likely will be then where it will be tomorrow. Hence the hodl and long term speculators.

Yes they take bitcoin as collateral. So if you believe bitcoin goes down and you want to profit from a short use bitmex.
BTC &gt; Bitmex
Sell btc (sell one dollar bitcoin contracts and use your bitcoin as collateral). When the price falls you can buy back the dollar contracts for a lower price and you gain more bitcoin.
As long as you use stop losses and don't trade your whole bank you still have (most of) the collateral when the bitcoin price goes up. So you are not totally short (like how you can go with stocks).

In your opinion. I expect it to have some benefits in the future. And as bitcoin is priced in any inflationairy the chances are that i will not be right are very slim.

I read it many times. But technically i can't add much. I just know basically how it works.
Economically is a much more important factor i suppose. Every holder should know the economics about it. While any non holder may even use/build on top of bitcoin, just to provide new services etc.
I think there should be more ways to fund developers to technically improve bitcoin or make just awesome applications on top of it. But as often seen with easy money (alt market), if you raise a shit ton of money not much get created in the end.

He honestly nailed it 100%! This way it was worht really almost nothing at the beginning by oversupply the network, everybody got a shitload of bitcoin (spreading it). It was just a fun thing to do. By this many people got interested and it was really easy/cheap to get into bitcoin. In this way it spread bigly without giving it away, but also no one really had all the issued coins (like you see in many alts). But now the idea has started to develop, suddenly it starts to half. This first one, then the second, etc. Every time the market stock to flow gets cut in half. Still it supplies us all who want to get into bitcoin pretty nicely, but if you don't see it now in time you really gona pay for it later. Because we humans will put a tremendous value on it once it gets real scarce. (Next halving the S2F makes it as scarce as gold).


Show me any proof in history in which deflation was bad? I love my almost free lights and the tremendous increase in my smartphone. The world is full of deflation. The only thing that can only work with inflation is our current financial system, that surely will implode on too much deflation (but that is why we got bitcoin in the first place,  to brake this ill system). The whole debt/money system is bad, very bad. That needs an ever increasing model (inflation) to not break down. But this also creates a run down on everything, you will need to work harder. Pay more for a house, pay more hours for medicare, go later on pension, etc etc. The perfect slavery system without anyone noticing it.

True, but this is also still a bitcoin problem. Bitcoin is very secury under the right conditions. But there are so many ways to go wrong, that many not so experienced bitcoiners might make errors. This is a big attacking flaw.

Bitcoin is not another payment processor, it is very bad at that actually. And the world has enough good ones around already with very big market share. Bitcoin is about something else, try to learn that or maybe bitcoin isn't for you. (Many in the west actually don't necessarily need bitcoin).

But before you do trading, signing up for something else. I would argue you can better learn about bitcoin. 
Some quick information about some good sources, it is best to do your own research.
 - great videos to give you a good understanding of what bitcoin is. Highly recommend it to watch at least some of his conferences.
The book: "The Bitcoin Standard" from author Saifedean Ammous - it will give you a better understanding of what money is!
If you really got into it this far, there is another great source to entertain yourself even longer!: 
Wait i will search some docu's to help you out further:
HIDDEN SECRETS OF MONEY - MIKE MALONEY  S1 :   (watch the whole serie).
Money as Debt - Full Documentary:  
How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio:

Digital price tags. Multiple units (BTC, mbit, Satoshi).


There is sub-satoshi already on the LN it is 1/100 of a Satoshi. You can endlessly scale it downwards too if we need to do so.


It is likely that tx fees for the bitcoin blockchain will rise a lot later on. This makes the system secure. But with LN and/or other developments the need for normal users to use bitcoin layer becomes less. We will never really pay coffee with the most secure ledger and store it forever (you can at the moment though, abuse it lol). Future development will make everything go automatic under the hood of an App. I mean do you really know when you send money online at your bank how the bank handles all the hops between central banks, clearing houses, forex exchanges, etc. No one cares really.


Simply said, bitcoin is not just another payment processor. Learn more about bitcoin to really understand this (watch Andreas his videos for example).

Yes you are right about the education part and the way people should on board in any way which helps them. But where do you see the big advancement through more adoption then? By financial products such as ETF's and other products? By direct custodial services? That bitcoin becomes another asset class in which wallstreet invest so that everybody indirectly gets exposed to bitcoin? 
Because here i don't really see any logical future yet. Something i see/hope it is in most/all of those directions. But maybe my opinion and pro bitcoin mind just wants it too badly. It's like the educational part no one is waiting for, sometimes it feels like this in general to me, that no one really has a desire for bitcoin.


True, although there might be more blockchains running with total different functions, i can't really argue from this perspective, i do think something like ETH is a valuable blockchain solution, but they can't even really do it on their own chain, so i doubt it can ever succeeed around bitcoin? Economically all those small blockchains doesn't make any sense indeed. But i think we already see them slowly dieying off. When bitcoin start to adopt parts of their interesting functions in the bitcoin blockchain it is over for them. This process will take time i guess, some people just really believe in their tokens (which then can persists quiet a while).

You are confused here. It is actually not the exchange that holds your money, the exchange is simply waiting for your bank to send the money over to them. This can take up days and sometimes even weeks.
Banks hold your money onto their books for a while so they can gain interest or just make their books a little better (a better reserve ratio). You should definetely talk to your bank ans ask if they can stop this madness, if not try to find a better bank.
As long as the exchange didn't receive the fake cash (fiat money), they will not let you send hard cash (bitcoin) out of course, that would be very stupid!
To be clear, if i sent a SEPA wire to coinbase it arrives in 2-4 hours on a business day, so i can buy and send the bitcoin away without any problems.

So true.
Also intersting to see how bitcoin is going to change the wealth gap not only from elder generation to millenials. But also going from western middle class to the clever people in developed countries. A wealth redistribution in two ways at the same time.
Now i am thinking about it and become even more bullish about this phenomen. You can really just look at what happened at the internet in this case. Internet has spread wealth to those we jumped in early. Everyone who didnt think they needed the internet is now left behind (many companies went bankrupt), those people who didnt adapt became jobless. But also i see for example how much Eastern Europe has advantages through this tech boom. Because the internet doesn't care if you are from New York or from Seberia.

Sure we wouldn't!
All the debt just magically gets paid.
When the trust gets lost there will be hyperinflation. Look at how much trust the USD has compared to bitcoin. It is already hyperinflating on a small scale, wait till the masses starts to see this. When we hit $100k, what exactly will stop bitcoin for hitting $1m? Exactly hyperinflating and nothing in place to stop the process.
And if not in bitcoin there is the flight in gold already starting too.
USD had the luxery that they could export their inflation away, while the whole world was hidding in USD as it was better than a national currency. Now people have a new choice, bitcoin is gaining trust all around the world (in places where they first only trusted USD).

I always was "waiting" for the next crash, but i learned that just being in the market actually is less risky then you might think. Ever year the crash doens't come the market in general goes up. 
The "crash" of let say 50% becomes more meaningless every year you gain profits, until the point that actually a crash wouldn't bring you to the lows you had seen earlier in life.
Time in the market is more important then being right on the trades all the time. Hence why people should also throw in some money into bitcoin, regardless of its exact price.

In the end it doesn't really matter who or how bitcoin is owned. When too many bitcoin are hodl together and something like Gox happens, people smarten up and new standards will be made. Some just firstly have to lose money before they learn.

If you plan to buy more and hold for long term, you could just dollar cost average.
From my experience it doesn't really matter at wich level you buy. The most important thing is that you actaully buy them! 
Sure by "perfect timing" you could maybe get 10%  more. But it is far more likeley that you miss out on +100%. It is really risky stuff to time this volatile market. The people who waited for 2.5k earlier this year missed out on 7500 by not paying 500 more.

You missed the recent decrease in limits for spending cash over €3k? In the Netherland the ban on cash is being lobbied for years now. They create a non excisting problem like "money launder" or other non arguments. All in order to ban cash for whole different reasons.
So many people were applauding this change so that they can catch the "real criminals". No wonder that they may feel okay with the government. They simply drink their kool-aid and are screaming for more.
But in general i think The Netherlands is more social were as USA is more self reliant. You see it back in the laws, rights,  principles etc.

If say i have 10k stock, then sold them all in one lot, it would likely drive the price down, then when everyone else panics and sells as well.   So the stock market doesn't work? Manipulation will always be in any market as long as they can make a profit (and get away with it).


Bitcoin isn't a system build to be "fair" as in the sence everybody has the same. It is build to be fair in the way that no one can cheat the system. Your government can just print a trillion of your currency at which point you lose all the value of your fiat. Banks and governments have been doing this exactly for many centuries. This is the kind of people bitcoin want to fight against.
Stability will come much later (think decades). As long as many people still need to onboard and are'nt sure about bitcoin there will be wild price swings. Simply said, for you one bitcoin isn't worth the same price as for your neighbour, somewhere inbetween is the real actual price. Sometimes your neighbour is more right, sometimes you are.

This is wrong. And has been shown both in bitcoin and gold market.
Mining doesn't dictate the price of the good. Miners just can to their business profitably up until the market price. And most of the time free markets will move the margins in that direction. (As long as it is profitable humans keep expanding their endeavors).
If you understand this, S2F suddenly makes sense again.


Here there price is just set by supply/demand. Lets be hoenst, land is not scarce, so it is not valued in that way. The only thing in land that is "scarce" are government licenced building permits, hence you see more value there.
Maybe a better way to compare bitcoin at a later stage to paintings. Paintings of (dutch) old paintors have no new supply (or almost zero), and the price of those paintings really is almost infinite. It is really what a crazy fool pays for it. It can be one millione or one billion. 
I think by the time bitcoin reaches this point it is very likely that fiat lost mosts of its value. (Not all, but it become more and more valueless).

What we currently have is an inflation debt slavery system where everybody "needs" to work and that seems like a good thing.
A governent should be like a company. Companies love to do the same work with half of the people. Our whole capitalisic system is build and thriving on this. And yet the government feels the need to operate on as much forced labor as possible and sees that as a good thing. Rather than to look at the outcome and get things done with as few people as possible.

If you have your Ledger correctly installed and there is no update or anything needed you theoretically only need the pincode to enter your ledger and then you can send your bitcoin away.
But don't trust on this. If the pincode is filled in three times wrong your ledger would be reset and your bitcoins are gone. Maybe there is something wrong with your ledger or it needs some kind of update and bitcoins are gone.
The most important things are the 24 seed words! With those words you can revive your bitcoin even without a ledger (if the need is there). 
A Ledger is just a device to securely enter your bitcoin wallets without your seed ever touching the internet (so no one can steal it).

People are so ffed up because they never got learn basic logics. Another example, in my country there is a capital gain tax of 1.5% of every euro over 25k. 
So until people reach 25k, they feel all is well. They save money and feel good about it. Until they reach 25k and then they suddenly start to worry about taxes they have to pay. I read a story yet again yesterday about this.
Now in this example someone has saved up 30k and suddenly worried about the capital gain tax. As she needs to pay 1.5% over 5000 and that is 75 euro. So now she feels like something is up and she needs to pay to save money, this can't be real right?!
But they forgot the inflation is 3% and over that first 25k they pay an invisible thief 750 euro! It so mindboggling that people with high level of education still can't see this very simple structure. Mind boggling!

Same can be said for higher education of course. You better have a socity were kids went through a high education. Sure it makes the degrees worth less, it makes everybody "clever". 
But at least people can think in a decent way, they speak multiple languages, because of this higher education level the economy gets a boost through support a higher thinking level economy. Which again benefits the whole country (paying back dividends on the investment).
But to be honest, even my country now is flipping to a indebtness of student loans. Which i think is a horrible wrong step every following closer the american ffed up capitalism system which certainly isn't the best. But i guess debts are just too tempting for the master.

The stock market is a great example indeed.
Amazon did more then 10x in the last decade. Can you name a handfull of penny stocks which did a 10x because Amazon did so? Stock market rises because the underlying stocks deliver value, the ones that don't deliver value die. (Remember still: Kodak, world online, enron or the thousands of other names)?
But if you really think that A might rise beacuse of B rises, go ahead. If you think Iron will be more valuable because gold becomes more valueble. 
If you think a scarce bitcoin is becoming worth more and because of that a random not scarce shitcoin which is nothing like bitcoin will also be worth more you might be coming out feeling a little cheated in the next run.

Don't try to justify free markets with news. Because it keeps you busy forever and you probably never right.


It's not like someone has to buy 5 btc for the price to significantly change. A lot of money went in to the price increase.
Bitcoin does it bitcoin thing. Have you missed the drop from 19k to 3k? So basically now we just are back half way to the top. It is maybe not "normal", but no one really can value the price of bitcoin correctly, hence the sharp up and down movements as people have different opionions, money flows in and out, manipulation, easy money through trading, altcoin scam/hype.
Ask a economist how much bitcoin is worth and he tells probably zero, ask a miner and he tells probably his cost price of 3-7k. Ask us here and prices go from 1k to 1 million. You see the difference? Market price is an equilibrium of all those "opinions". If you think the price is wrong you can also start to speculate on it. (Upwards or downwards).
But don't forget, in general the market is pretty accurate. But there is no bad/good news needed for different prices, just the sentiment of mr market has to change.

Everone is wrong on price predictions. 
But it is just much more likely that in the long run bitcoin outperforms altcoin. They aren't really dying as not excisting anymore. The price will just go close to zero so that it doesn't matter anything.

I think many actually been around bitcoin for a while. I also downloaded the bitcoin wallet, made a few transactions. Was really impressed on how it works. But i figured out i couldn't make money through mining, so i kind of left it and thew away everything. Even saw it rise and rise, but it was always on my todo list. Until the price was ricing so fast that i simply couldn't ignore it any longer and pretty much went down the rabbit whole directly.
The whole thing of those big boom bust cycles makes people interested. And even the most clever people have a hard time getting it from the beginning. And most of those have a background in either IT, cryptographics, economics. And yet it takes time. I see still that only a few people really understand it fully. Most people get it partly and many don't get it at all (altcoiners for example). Because basically you need to understand the need for cryptography and the way bitcoin + it's blockchain works, then you need to know econimcs about money, investing, history etc to really understand what's going on.

Because it actually works, such currency wars. (I live in the Euro zone btw). 
For example in 2008 a €10.000 car costed $15.800, nowadays through currency devaluation that same 10k car will cost you $11.100! So basically for Americans an European car became 20% cheaper. And Western European countries are big exporters, so although it is not really good for their country. Export is booming, which in turn booms the economy.


True, but countries who are making second or third best products will try to do anything to make their industry work. I think the car industry is a perfect example of that world wide. And for many countries it doesn't even matter how much tax payer money gets pumped into that industry.
I hate to say it, but up until a certain degree all those currency wars and protectionism plans do actually work. No it is not good for the people inside or outside the country. But governments in general only care about their own short term goals. So they make quick "wins".

Because humans are perfectly known to go into the strongest money/currency over time. History has shown this again and again.  Fiat currencies have no other way then to keep inflating, bitcoin fights that, so the converstion of fiat into bitcoin will really never stop until their is no fiat (value of the fiat) left to convert anymore.


It doesn't matter if you give your fiat or bitcoin for something. As you can give bitcoin and buy back the bitcoin with fiat anyway. You just buy something because you want it, or you don't.

Exactly, you can put so much time in it and still learn new/more things. And even only starts to make more sence when you see it from a different angle.
But i think at the same time that is the challenge though. To really make many people understand it on a broad basis. Even Antonopoulos  for example says sometimes that bitcoin migth fail and we can just start a new coin. From a technical perspective this is correct, but from an econimcal perspective i don't agree that bitcoin can just fail and we start over.

I do think that there is some different building going on to make it simpler. But to be honest, the main reason is that bitcoin stays very secure. So that is the main focuss, which make a higher transaction fee unfortunete if it is, but i and many others rahter pay a higher fee then use some shitty blockchain.
This also took me a while as i also pay rather not much for something. But bitcoin is just valueable, it's blockchain is precious too.
But i do like LN, but it is still so new. Not only the UX is not that great, there aren't many who accept it (although some bitcoin payment proccessors have adopted it already! I used it too). If there aren't many users, not many who download the current apps, the progress isn't going any quicker.

Look at the USD. It is pretty stable as the world trust in it. So they can devalue it, print it, start some wars. And still there is a lot of trust in USD. They can even borrow 21 trillion dollars, and yet the value stays relatively stable (as the whole world is worse off with their own shitty currencies).
When everyone agrees 1 hour of labour is worth around 10 satoshi or when a littre milk is around 1 satoshi and everyone in the world kind of agrees the price doesn't bunch much. So than you are at the final stabilzed stage.
It will take at least some decades though.

All those charlatans would go to all the trouble of making those videos, books, potcasts, social media marketing to make money while they "know" where the chart is going? 
If they really had an edge they would abuse that edge forever and don't waste time on this.
That being said, sometimes it is nice to follow them to get a feel of what others think. Together with your own views and a market sentiment on a forum for example you get a pretty good idea on where the market is at. So they are "useful", but don't believe just all they are saying.

Printing money is a general name for the creation of money. Even central banks don't print money anymore FYI. They just change a database entree. And boom a billion dollar is "printed".
Most of the money doesn't get created by central banks though. Most of the money gets created through the banking system. And that is exactly the crony people (1%'s) who are the discusting people in the world. They create nothing and leech on the world's working force. And if all their speculation and everything turns out wrong the tax payer can jump in as they are "to big too fail".


No it isn't, do you find it okay that your positive credit in your bank account at the same time is someone else it's debt? How can one dollar be two things at the same time?

To fix the next crisis interest rates will drop below zero. So bitcoin becomes very tempting. USD will be not so strong and there is for the first time a whole new asset in which people could flight. 
Not saying that it will, but there is a change that it gets so bad that the big fiats started to hyperinflate (everyone wants bitcoin). Because smart money isn't missing this ride up. And if everything starts to crash and bitcoin could go higher (not a certainty but i see the possibility). Things can go crazy real quick.
@_date: 2019-07-03 22:52:29


Sure, those markets don't go away, bitcoin is just an extra option.


Although some countries will just follow US policies, there will be enough countries who seek the opportunity and fuck with USA in the meanwhile and go futher in developing this shit. Bitcoin still has all the perks and USA basically advertises the need.


That's what they make you believe in the news. In '17 it was overhyped, in '18/'19 underhyped. The development never stopped of course.


Demand will not stop, ever anymore. It is like saying when internet will be not being used anymore.


It is funny how people at one moment say bitcoin is only used for illegal activities and at another moment that it can't be used when it becomes illegal. Common people make up your mind, which off the two it is?


Oh boy....
Don't get me wrong, if big govs going to really try to enforce bans it will really set back bitcoin for years. But what will come out of those bans will be astonishingly strong. There will always be exchanges, there are 196 countries, no way they all follow the same rules. You can see something like bitcoin.de, where you can sell bitcoin directly p2p with normal bank transfers (so every bank transfer done can be a bitcoin purchase/sale, good luck banning that). New websites like localbitcoins will rise again. Maybe even physical coins will start to circulate.

Because indeed bitcoin is a protocol. Whereas our ideas of dollars is mostly fiction. And as we can even work with this government story, we certainly can start to believe in bitcoin over time.
You seem indeed to know it, so that is good :) Just didn't know why you mention it as very similar. Because besides the "in xxx we trust" there aren't that many similarities..


Forex is the most speculated market in the world. Much more than any other market combined.. And it is heavily influenced by (central)bankers and politics. The only difference is that the swings are much less. No wonder if the USD&lt;&gt;EUR changes 10% in one day we talk about very very heavily losses. 
I do think here you make a misjudgement.


Yea i can agree with that. But because most are still skeptical it is not hard to see that others speculate on exactly that idea. Most in the world have no clue yet about bitcoin, few really believe it. So no wonder it is highly volatile and super speculative. The estimates what bitcoin is worth are from 0 to about 10 million USD. It probably takes a few more decades to really work out (in whatever direction we might go)

Both systems are based on trust.
And it is very likely that humans will start to trust a strong selfregulating cryptographic code more than some grey backroom bankers who set interest rates, create boom/busts, print a shitload of money for themselves and their cronny friends.
As soon as the trust starts to tip over there willl be hyperinflation in fiat and that $100k mark will be gone by in seconds. The next crisis will be a remarkable one imo. Bitcoin has its prime moment at that time to show off.
Banks will fail again, atm's stop spitting money out, accounts will get frozen again, inflation/deflation?, cental bankers who don't know how to respond and just try different (new) things to "stimulate" debt and consumption ever more. The people who have zero bitcoin or gold (or some other assets like special art) have no clue what is comming and will be hit so hard.

In theory yes, very easy as you just described. In practice, highly highly unlikely, even with some super computer and some math geniuses. (Otherwise everyone would do it and be rich).
Probably you will gain a few times and then you sold but the price never reaches your buy again. You buy higher and eventually have less then when you just would have hodled.

In my country houses on average go for like $300k, anyone who is buying always goes 100% long leverage. The banks are laughing like crazy and the government too dips their toe into the profits.
It boggles my mind that everyone finds it normal and plays in the game. If you take that 300k and buy a cheap house abroad you could basically live simple and retire (basic living and maybe some simple work).

Nassim Taleb's book the black swan is about unseen events. Much like the credit crisis from last time, i think this is a pretty good way it will go down again.
Of course some people "predicted" the 08 crisis. But 99% of the people didn't see it coming.
I think now we again have something like that. Another trigger, don't really know what. Maybe still something  like deutche bank. It is been like in slow decline for ages, but maybe something will trigger it to fail totally.

Stacking fiat isn't stupid either. When you bet a small (in our case not so small) amount of your portfolio on a huge one sided bet it is good to have cash. Loads of cash.
Nassim Taleb even once describes it might be better to have 1% in a risky investment and 99% cash. The 99% cash would prevent you from failure. The 1% bet in something risky but can hughly pay off. Bitcoin certainly was a perfect examle of this way of investing in the past.

Besides that, don't undervalue the network effect in bitcoin, that is a big part to make it work well. Imo if bitcoin not succeed this whole crypto thing is doomed to not work. Because if bitcoin can't become the SoV, why cryto 2.0 will become 1? Then it will be doomed just like fiat A or B.

And yet it still only on paper and not a real loss. If for example you bought a car, i offered you 15% of your payment for it, would you sell it or would you say i am crazy? That is basically what a 85% loss means, you never have to sell and as long as you think the asset is still worth the price you paid for or even more, you shouldn't!


So you basically believe in a ponzi scheme for where other people pay you the money to buy things you want? Bitcoin is about the opposite of what you describe. But yet you can indeed use it for that purpose if you really want to (nothing wrong about doing that).
Bitcoin is used every second every day by all the hodlers, holding/storying value is a perfect usecase and exactly why bitcoin was designed. Satohsi didn't create another payment system (which is completely impossible to make so by bitcoin's design).
Alts will end up sooner or later as useless coins and will not bounce back ever the way bitcoin will do so. It is just impossible for thousands and thousands of coins to keep up with bitcoin (if it nearly suceeds in trying what it is trying to accomplish). Yes halvings will likely have less effect in the future and become more predictable. But anyway it is an information/knowledge gap between different people, so the concept may have a way bigger (human logic) impact which could stay for long. As bitcoin basically becomes harder to get your hands on, people tent to hold on a bit stronger (so the tradeable supply drops way more than the actually mining supply, which causes huge shortages).

Its like having an Mastercard card machine and not having it connected. The custommer doesn't have to open a channel, the coffee shop would/should connect itself to the network.
For example i have a channel opened as soon as i installed a LN app and it still works fine one and a half year later. I can use it for sending and receiving and didn't need to open a new one every time. Also i never met anyone who was into LN and had no open channel ready.

That is a perfect use case for bitcoin.. As soon as you put your wealth out of the Lira and into bitcoin (you just have your 24 word seed phrase), you can take bitcoin whereever the f you want.
Bitcoin is fairly liquid and you can swap it for almost any currency around the world in just a few minutes. Both physically or digitally.
A slight problem, do Libanese people understand fiat/Lira/current situation/bitcoin etc?

You need first a SoV and then you will get a MoE. Not visa Versa.
You mean that if Venezuala creates a good trading system all problems in the country will be solved? No they can't get a SoV system, so their current MoE system (which does work in 100+ countries) does not work.
SoV &gt; MoE, it is very easily understandable if you read some history books or just the history of money. (Shabo has a great read for you about this).


So you don't buy anything anymore? All the money you spent right now in fiat is still a loss of oppertunity in bitcoin. As you could have spent that money in bitcoin and still be the same pizza guy. You think only the pizza guy  lost that day? What about a million of other people who bought at that day a pizza instead of bitcoin? They all had the opportunity to get 10.000 BTC right there!

What if bitcoin will keep preforming as the best asset for the next whole decade?
I mean i love to spent my satoshi's with LN. But to be honest i rather take out my credit card and pay with my worthless euro's. I live in a country where paying with debit card is the norm. People don't pay with credit cards, nor with their fancy mobiles which is an option too. Why? The debit card system works and no one bothers to step onto something new as long as the old system is working fine for them.
Bitcoin payment systems like LN are a nice add on. But the real value in bitcoin is not that you can pay your coffee with it. It is the most secure and decentralized way to store your value and keep it from every fucker in the world.
It fights with policitians, governments and (central) bankers. It doesn't matter if it can not compete with visa or mastercard. We are fighting with way bigger fish.

Bitcoin's supply is fixed and known for the future. This means that in theory there aren't really any supply shocks (for now the halvings still do create supply shocks though, but anyway they become less meaningfull).
When fiats lose confidence people start to put there trust into something else. Let's say bitcoin would fulfill this role. This means that from that moment the whole world would look in ways to get bitcoin (labour, creation, etc etc). This means that there is a extreme high demand for bitcoin (much higher then the demand for USD ever reached). 
This will result in probably the most stable money the world has ever seen in history. Gold historically was pretty stable but still had supply shocks throughout history as they always found new recources.

holding bitcoin (saving) is good as it gets coins out of the roulation. If more people want bitcoin but no one sells bitcoin, this means the price rices. Rising prices makes everyone happy and doing more holding and more price risings. It becomes a self fulfilling loop.

Oh i know what the original idea of a future contract is. But it is hardly used for that purpose. They are the ultimate tool to speculate.
And an option on a future contract is even worse, as there is hardly anything more speculative then that.


It hold it underlying asset (by a fysical etf at least), so it is used for good speculation only (speculation when you put hard earned money into things in which you thing it turns out better for the long run), instead of speculation on worthless future contracts with no real asset or value.


strictly speaking you can easily invest in an asset which doesn't generate cash flow. If it is a wise investment is another story, but that's for the investor to decide.


Is it though? In the regular financial markets those future contracts have totally overtaken the actual physical underlying products. As the options/futures have a way way bigger trading volume they became the market basically. And a paper contract is thousands times easier to manipulate then real hard assets trading.

Lol, deversifing in bitcoin, you might want to read up more instead investing more. You clearly don't fully understand where you actually invest in.
Outside bitcoin you can invest in stocks, but it looks like that you don't really have the buying capacity to do that (fees will eat up way too much). You can invest in some mutual fund/etf. There are also funds for Real Estate.
But then again, deversifing because of deversifing is stupid actually. Just know firstly in what you invest and then see if you know enough to invest in other things as well. Otherwise you just get slaughtered by the market at some day.
@_date: 2019-11-07 15:40:37
I have searched about it before with bitfinex. That was incase there is like a flash crash or something and the leveraged money (which you lend out), gets whipped out you basically lose everything.
Don't know the exact risks on Bitmex futures though. And bitmex itself is rather secure i guess. But anyway, 10~% on risking your capital at bitmex isn't that much as you think. Do some research and if you really think it is okay, you can do it (and in this way reduce the % as if more people do it the rate will go down of course).
And it well may be just a temporary bull market phenonem which goes away in a couple of months. People may bank big time on those futures while you got your 3%.

I think he makes a really good analysis here of what is going to happen. There is way too much debt and debt liabilities in the world right now.
We could just default on those debts, but that is very unlikely imo. Most likely the interest rates stay low or are even going lower (it is already negative in the EU).
What happens next is that the central banks start to print a shit ton of money to print our way out of this self created mess and "save" the currency/country/economy.
If this scenario will come true, you should be in assets like: Stocks (high but with printing fresh money we are not that high), gold, bitcoin &amp; RE.
Avoid: Bonds, fiat money.
@_date: 2019-11-14 09:39:59


Yes might be. But historically such events gain traction and then suddenly everyone not opting out in time gets left behind overnight, it only takes some months when hyperinflation kicks in.
But maybe it just keeps going steadily and over long periods of time as citizens around the world slowly awaken and this can keep happening for the longest time.
Really anything can happen as bitcoin is new on many levels, so it is impossible to even envision how it will go.


Yes you are right. But i don't see the Euro or Dollar go away anytime soon (okay euro maybe, but certainly they will swap to another fiat firstly). You could convert it against gold, which is pretty logical, but gold trades against fiat as well. The 100trillion s2f works fine when calculated against gold.
But gold isn't really used as measurement by most folks either.

My bank right now is pulling this crap on me.
The things they ask me and the way they do it is outrages.
Basically they point to me that i am a criminal and i need to proof that the money is legit (while all money went through there accouts in the first place).
I can comply with laws without such enforement. In finance you are guilty and you need to proof your own unguiltiness, that is the oposite of how our normal laws work. And the worst case is, if they don't like your proof they just take/freeze your money and you can start to prosticute them (without your own money).

For creation multi sig wallet: 
Create new wallet, click 2-2 sig, then pretty much the same as a normal electrum wallet (also hw wallets work).
If you have a multi sig wallet, you create a transaction in wallet A for example. But now you can't send it directly. You can copy the tx text which you created.
Then you go to Wallet B. Under tools &gt;  Load transaction &gt; from xx you can open the transaction, now you can broadcast the tx and your bitcoin will be send.
You can create some wallets on Electrum and try it out with 1$, it's an interesting experiment.

If that would be the case the whole concept would not work. Why would you trust that coin and not the next coin? A switch to a "better" store of value can happen only so often (read Szhabo's historie of money to grasp the idea).
Taking the bitcoin concept and doubling the space isn't creating a better SoV. Taking the blockchian idea and creating a fast transaction isn't creating a new better SoV. Maybe someday someone come up with a better SoV. History shows it will, but for the next many decades/centuries bitcoin will do just fine.

No one really knows. I think it will go in a similar direction as gold.
But in a liquidity squeeze gold also sold off in 2017. So really every time it is different. But the bullrun of 2019 for gold and bitcoin shows that a sharp rise is not out of the question.

A better question would be, how the rest of the world will look like.
Some things the internet has done:
* Changed the news (paper) industry
* Got rid of the traditional shopping industry
* Changed traveling agencies from hundreds of thousands around the world to a few players online
* Made it possible for people with a house to play "hotel"
* Changed much of how people spent their (free) time
* Distrupted the few telehpone companies who had total control over communication to mere internet providers, communication is now 100x better and almost free.
* Companies who didn't exist or were never needed before suddenly have a market cap of $200B - $1T+
This is only the beginning of that technologic advancement, it will put gasoline on new inventions like bitcoin. Making the two advancements even to advance to unforseable heights.

The altcoin hype of 2017 was an one time thing. Many speculators and scammers saw their chance to ride on the bitcoin hype and sell crap to unkown investors who thought to get rich quick.
Now every noob is holding bags of alts which they hope they can dump on new investors. Only that last reason is already enough to never let it happen in the same way. They much rather create new alts then and start over with their alts.

Bitcoin speculation isn't bad. And if people trust that 1 tether is worth something and trade bitcoin with/against it nothing wrong either. IF you don't like it you can not use it or even short it if you really think we are crazy (go ahead, i can even invite you to the party).

I think it does consider demand very much so.
Bitcoins main price valuation comes from demand i would argue. The model shows what is reachable and what is unsustainable.
If the current demand sharply rises we go about those lines (seen in the past), if the demand lowers we go below the lines, which also can be seen. 
In 2017 we could no longer sustain a 20k bitcoin because the demand couldn't keep up with the supply. Hence everyone started to jump of the ship. But it pushed us back to here as demand grew very much at 6-3k.
The demand could really dry up though indeed, that is unpredictable. But imo that only happens when bitcoin is flawed. If it drops to $100 without any flaws, heck i would buy all the bitcoins i can, like thousands others with me.

There is a "law" that says that every years something excist it predicts that it stays alive for a year. Bitcoin excist 10 years so it predicts now that it stays around at least another ten years. I forgot the name of this concept.
Anyway, bitcoin can go down to zero. But it is extreme unlikely as all the way down there will be people who are interested to buy up the bitcoin. There is a chance that there is an unseen flaw in bitcoin which is unfixable, but thsi seems out of the question ten years in. It has been attacked for about 10 years now.

Not all countries have the same ideas to manipulate their citizens as much as possible. And if they are first mover they take advantage over it.
Look for example inside Europe how one government is against it and another is pro crypto. All companies move to those countries. If a group of people can take such easy advantage over another they most likely will.

Businesses convert on the spot.
Same as an American pays in Europe, the retailer gets euros and the American get withdrawn usd at spot price.
What really is interesting about bitcoin is that it has a fixed supply 21 million coins, so no one can create more out of nothing. Your fiat money gets faked all the time every day. So banks and governments profit from that you save some amounts in fiat. They basically steal your money without most people realizing this.
When you have 1 bitcoin, you will have 1 bitcoin. That is for now, tomorrow or over 100 years. I can guarantee you that a $100 bill in 100 year is worhtless. And USD is the strongest currency of all! So alll the money you see today around the world, in 1 century is worthless! Think about that for a second.

Lost bitcoin makes the bitcoin holders who didn't lose their keys a little worth more. A perfect fair system as you can see, those who lose they lose, those who think can win.


You see this inforrectly. Even just 1 bitcoin is enough for the system to work. As you can device a digital "1" into an infinite pieces regardless.


Bitcoin indeed doesn't solve this. It just makes the system fair and hence we will not have a wealth gap between those who take and those who left with nothing. 
Early investors are rewarded handsomely, as they should in a capitalistic open market.


Value and price are dictated by the market, not the whales.


A deflated or very low inflated currency can work perfectly well. Why you think a currency need to be inflated to work? A slavery based debt system would indeed no longer work, but that's not our problem.

The dollar will be obsolete one day or another, there isn't even a question about that.


In my country the fight on cash is in full power (mainly to enable negative interest on "savings" accounts).


I just said a random high number. First thing we will ahve to reach is $100k, that will be still with very high volatility. I doubt that we see any low volatility under the gold market cap ($350k). But we will see what happens, i don't even care about the volatility to be honest. It is just what it is and we can't change it. 
Also tradional financial markets are more volatile then most think (not in percentage terms, but their total market caps create and brake trillions of dollars in a short time).
I don't play the get rich game, i just stay away of the get slow poor game. And in time more and more people will play it with me. You think that it is a ponzo to get rich quick, data from the past and those who holding showing the exact opposite. Look at the many bitcoin advocates who are very very rich already. They don't unload their bitcoin holidings although they can easily do so for high prices. They know the money it trades against is worthless, it is a change of mindset you not yet have or probably not evne understand.

Servers aren't really the problem. There is always a country which would host those servers even if bitcoin is blocked in most countries (there are already enough examples out in the wild internet for this).
Exchanges are a central point of failure but mostly just because there isn't really a threat against them (from governments). As soon as we will start to see governments trying to attack bitcoin in this way we will see much more resilient solutions.

And it doesn't matter if they know you know. Do you think people know before they start stealing from someone how much they get take?
A hardware wallet has potentially millions on it and most likely at least a few grand. When bitcoin is populair enough you make a serious target of yourself. Of course it depends if you travel to Norway or South America. But still.

Not really healthy no i agree, but those who hold tethers and use finex are at risk. Not really a problem for bitcoin whatsoever


How it is false liquidity ?


The increase in tether was/is backed by real dollars. So of course the bitcoin price could increase as likely also more bitcoin were bought by the same people (arbitrage /mm).
According to the NYAG case you can see that tether is backed for 85% by usd and 15% by finex assets. Which lets be honest, isn't that bad at all!

Some people/exchanges will lose a lot of money.
Some exchanges might actually get in trouble from that loss.
Arbitrage can be done less effectively so the exchanges will have less acturate prices (everyone will start to pay a little more for trading bitcoin).

So you say it is a guarantee that bitcoin would go x30 in less then 5 years? Although i see it going there, i wouldn't advice any of those people to actually go on this path, it is high risk imo (hence the probable reward though).

Yes it is really unique. It is good though. Two parts of a cycle, one where the hardcore holders stay and accumulate. The amount of people who become hodlers grow every cycle.
And a second part of the cycle when greed kicks in and it becomes a speculative bubble because of "get rich quick". New people will learn about bitcoin and become hodlers and accumulate in the next cycle.

I was thinking to buy gold due to the current financial situation in the world. Gold seems nice.
But then i thought to buy it " anonymously" i have to drive to a city, bargain a bit with the seller, anyway pay too much. Not buy more then 3k$ (max cash spending). And in the end i am not sure if i have a real gold coin or some fake shit.
Needless to say i ended up buying digital gold (bitcoin) instead. Did it by spending a couple minutes of my time from my lazy chair.

   Guessing coinbase (use the pro version for cheap transactions, its free, just some signup).


About the mixing you are right. It is not that difficult to accomplish. Not to spent all i am not really sure about. When you mixed them i think the coins are good to go.
Be aware of taxes though, it seems rather strange this way of doing business. For both you and your sis.


Yes, but i dunno, your tax office might wonder where so much money went. (They can think you are envading tax in storying bitcoin secretly for example). The USD cash to bitcoin might be better in this case. It will be harder to proof for them what you do with cash dollars. Although it is alos harder to get bitcoin with cash transactions.


Cold storage basically means some wallet that doesn't touch the internet (hardware wallet is most used and easiest way to accomplish). In this way your bitcoin are stored very securely if done right.


As far as i remember in the Wasabi wallet it is pretty clear which bitcoin are coinjoined and which aren't, but another wallet will make it straightforward and more error proof i guess.

It is not that hard.
Download the Electrum wallet (be sure you have a legit version from the .org website).
It is super easy to setup (write down the 12 seed words on paper, this is your key so be very careful with it!).
Then after it is installed it is an easy software where you can see your bitcoin addresses so you can receive bitcoin to those addresses.
If you start to hold a lot of money worth in bitcoin it is better to buy a hardware wallet (this protects your seed words way better as it never touches the internet).

You are confused here. It is actually not the exchange that holds your money, the exchange is simply waiting for your bank to send the money over to them. This can take up days and sometimes even weeks.
Banks hold your money onto their books for a while so they can gain interest or just make their books a little better (a better reserve ratio). You should definetely talk to your bank ans ask if they can stop this madness, if not try to find a better bank.
As long as the exchange didn't receive the fake cash (fiat money), they will not let you send hard cash (bitcoin) out of course, that would be very stupid!
To be clear, if i sent a SEPA wire to coinbase it arrives in 2-4 hours on a business day, so i can buy and send the bitcoin away without any problems.

Europe was pretty good with creating gold out of nothing haha.
But at least the gold based economy is an indication that it is working well for the economy. Look at many EU countries, i think many some centuries ago were thriving the hardest ever in human history.
Bitcoin will even be better as it is more secure (can't easily be stolen by other nations), and has a more fixed supply.

In money terms is stays pretty meaningful. 
But in bitcoin terms, in less then a decade only 225 coins will be added on a daily basis. While 20 million bitcoin will be availble for trading. So the market price will be totally set by the scarcity in the market, that's all i meant.

People were waiting for $1k bitcoin to get back in. And slowly more and more realized that that would never happen while some others were very greedy and buying up all bitcoin they could at those prices.
Then fomo kicked in from the people who were waiting on 1-3k$ bitcoin and missed out and instead payed double to get in.

I have been an engineer myself for some years. Employers love it when someone actually knows what he is talking about. You will be surprised how many "well" certified people know jack shit. Sure it is harder to land a job. But anyway, who wants to work at employers who employ pieces of paper over actual knowledge?
Until i became bored of that and started something for myself at that moment i even realized much more how little an education actually matters. In all those years i never have been asked about my "degrees" at all. They ask you only about work experience. 
Go borrow money at a bank, you think they ask you a finance degree? No of course not, lay out a good business plan and/or you perfectly well managed financial statement and they throw millions at you.
A degree is only really good for those who love to be part of the rat race.
Sure if you want to be a surgeon you gotta have some papers, but even there you will see changes when tech advances even further. So yes, for some jobs you better have a degree, but look at all the fairy tale degrees out in the wild. People have put themselves in debt for the weirdest worthless degrees you can't even imagine they excist.

Although he is right about focus on money/carreer. It is just one path and not done succesfull by many people.
Taking risks like buying bitcoin or stock or other big risk takings will get you further over the long run. And you are young and easily afford the risk.
@_date: 2019-08-05 08:04:07
If you check it without doing trading it is really pointless though.
And acting on those price changes can actually be very dangerous! Buy bitcoin and in the free time educate yourself on it.
@_date: 2019-08-24 11:49:06
The second best strategy is to market sell all.
But you anyway hope that you will get out more. That's why you lost a lot in the first place. But keep on hoping instead of going for bitcoin.
Read about bitcoin and learn anything you can. Then you will market dump those coins at an instant.

@_date: 2019-08-29 10:03:55
because if the price rises/falls on one exchange the arbitrage (bots) will buy or sell bitcoins across platforms as long as there is profit to be made.
So for example someone dumps 10000 bitcoin at market price on coinbase.
People will start to buy the cheap coins on coinbase and sell them on bitstamp (and any other exchange).
In a good functioning market these arbitrage moments can last only seconds (hence all the volume across the exchanges at the same time).

You see here nothing about trading as 99% of traders lose money.
Hence you see all those trading videos on youtube. Not because they make money from trading, but becaue they make money from youtube and/or try to sell you things.
A very few can trade anything profitable. And certainly bitcoin is extreme hard to trade as it is super volatile and a couple of big buy or sell orders can move the whole market/sentiment.
Buy and hold is the way to ride this thing. Watch his videos:

Trust/faith in a currency is what makes it a currency.
I know how fiat currencies work and break. Also the debt bubble is totally unsustainable. There is only one way this will end for bitcoin. And that is due to its scarcity and the governments who print a shit ton of fiat. Going up like crazy.
But have a look at the Argentinian peso, bitcoin could provide them a safe heaven profit of 15% in just one day. Sure you still think fiat currencies aren't volatile. As you have drinken yourself way too much kool-aid.

Actually the model might be more acurate than we now foresee. 10 mil seems really unrealistic.
But is it really? There is a change that bitcoin will really eat up all value of currencies around the globe. SoV in real estate. ETC. While all those other markets gets negative effected the gov has no choise other then to print more of their currency. So making the target even easier to reach.
I doubt that the next crisis is so easily fixed with fake money. Especially if there is a way out this time. In 2008 they started to print money like crazy. Besides gold you couldn't really go anywhere.
What if they start to print money and the money start to flow to bitcoin? Then the printing has zero effect (like you see in all those countries like Turkey, Ven, Ukraine, Argentina, etc). They print money but the money flows to USD/EUR. So more printing, high inflation and very little real benefits. If the biggest currencies start to act in the same way we have something huge.

People who are looking to sell back bitcoin for fiat are not yet totally convinsed (a dangerous state of investing).

Nobody knows.
But likely extreme speculative money goes out. People who sell to pay their debts, less margin speculation etc.
On the other hand it is likely that fiat money is searching for safety and might actually flow into bitcoin.
Both are likely scenarios, maybe they will play out both too. Maybe not at the same time (giving it sharp volatilty), maybe at the same time. No one knows, but it will for sure be a fun ride! Keep those satoshi's safe and dont panic!

I know it is not really possible but they try anyway no? And if you can't accurately measure it it is the first big benefit you can use to adjust it in your advantage (depending on where they want to see the inflation number).


Totally agree with you, and more often then not this number way more accurately shows the price rises.

How in general people install a wallet on the fresh computer and sign the transactions?
@_date: 2019-08-23 09:06:01


No it isn't.
Bitcoin isn't priced because of the cost price of mining. Bitcoin is valued at it's underlying script. It is scarce, functional, used as SoV for example. You can anon make payments. etc.
For example now bitcoin is valued at 10k$. This means that miners can spent up to ten k worth to mine one bitcoin, if they go over it they will go broke one day, if they stay under it it will be a profitable business. If the price goes up more miners will enter, if the price goes down miners go bust and turn off their machines.
@_date: 2019-08-20 09:42:04


You can't really say how far bitcoin is on this approach. Also bitcoin is used in different places. There are payment provides which you can look up and see what kind of places accept bitcoin (bars/restaurants). But bitcoin is also heavily used in the less legal online world. Whereas pp i only use at Ebay (and some other websites it is possible), but i stopped to use them if possible as they charge you like 10% fiat conversion rate. So ebay i now pay with creditcard instead.

Many price prediction "experts" are doing that for a living. On TV, newspapers, youtube, wherever.
They get paid while you are watching that crap. That whole business is not about teaching anything or giving you real information. Its just an easy cash grap.

Most likely bitcoin heading in this direction. Then the only way to really destroy it is just that bitcoin becomes obsolete. (How silver montairly became obsolete).

This eventually will be much bigger then the internet indeed. (Although that it is part of that technology).
That you can store wealth digitally is very useful. That the supply inflation rate in about a decade becomes so low and stays that low forever is something humans haven't really had ever!
This will have such major impacts on the world as it will change the way we do many things right now. (Central) banks can't operate in the same way, people will store wealth in bitcoin instead of houses, gold becomes less functional (yet again). You can use the ledger for all kinds of things we haven't even start thinking about. We could run world wide currencies on top of bitcoin to do safe, fair, anon, quick, cheap transactions!

@_date: 2019-08-05 16:04:28


Uhm it is.  Eurostat is a measure for the whole zone. Which is complete useless as i live and earn money in one country.


Okay, compare the YTD rate with any other currency in the world. Or take the 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9 years return for what matters.


If commercial money creation would pick up, and inflation would pick up as a result , there's nothing preventing the Fed or ECB to raise interest rates.
Rates are not high and economy isn't picking up. The bond yields are falling hard across EU for example, almost the whole union can borrow money for years for free. And yet it doesn't stimulate the economy, By pumping the interest rate the system will implode...


Because they horribily failed in their "stimulation", indeed there actually is deflation. The only major inflation we have seen so far went in assets. When those come falling down because no cheap money anymore we will see the worst financial crisis in history. Central banks have no power, they fight each other in the race to the bottom, people already don't really trust banks/governments/cb's. When this shit hits the fan $100k bitcoin will come real quick. The run for safety will be as never before.

If the dollar really collapses badly, probably the governments firstly come up with something new. A SDR based currency controlled by more governments or something.
Probably that will "work" for a while so bitcoin can be priced against that.
Otherwise bitcoin will become its own unit of account. Aka 1 house is worth 1 bitcoin for example.

Not really. It just indicates the supply inflation against the total stock.
These models just shows that the market price pretty much follows the model, and to make it valid, other comodities have the same pricing valuations. Supporting the idea that there is a solid bel
believing in that the scarce supply really sets a price range.

The future is here my friend...


Indeed it is like this. I always looked at negative rates more as a government stimulance to ease the debt and interest payments. But propping the market is probably a bigger desire from them, thanks for this insight!


True, basically i earn nothing on my money in the bank already (while having the risks of bankfailures, which are not small). So i converted most of my free available money to bitcoin instead. It feels much better actually (even though it is very volatile). In time more people will start to do this indeed.

A debt based symstem definetly will implode indeed when it doesn't grow.
For example the fed charges i think 0.25% interest, for all dollars into existence. Think of a game of monopoly, how that interest can ever be paid from the monopoly bank to the central bank? Where does that interest come from if the money in the monopoly bank is at a fixed supply?
The whole game is rigged from the very top, it is meant to "work" in this way. As it is basically a debt slavery system were everyone should have debts instead of assets.

Depends on how you see it. I think in less then 3 years there will be other products on the market, making the gap going to (close to) zero. This means that in 3 years you lose an extra ten percent on your investment. If you know anything about investment returns, then it is a hefty price.
But i don't need the product tax wise nor by any other regulation, so it is easy arguing from my side of course. If you have other benefits and this makes it worth the premium, no problem.
That company could at least arbitrage a bit of the premium away to let it under the 20% or so. They make an extra profit and there are more real bitcoins locked up in the GBTC  fund. Which i think is beter for all. (Not any exact terms here, just some idea to make it work better for everyone).

Of course it is not suddenly. Look at the market right now. All the problems boiling underneed the "smooth" surface. Gold went up already a lot this year showing that there is indeed something major to happen.
USD is already hyperinflating for 10 years measured in bitcoin. But bitcoin is still small so no one really notice anything. But lets see if they don't notice it throughout the next crisis.


It's not that one causes the other to hyperinflate but an end result of wrong actions and a very rapid decline in trust of that currency.
@_date: 2019-08-14 22:26:02


Further, the loan from to tether to bitfinex is on the balance sheet of finex. So it is covered by underlying assets.

Not far off from current cash back models.
IMF told also about that their ecoin might inflate and that the cash money gets just a different price, so that you can inflate cash too on the price difference (two price tag system).
So this year 1 ecoin is 1 cash, next year 1 ecoin = 1.04 cash.

Indeed this is exactly the reason. That's why in Denmark and Swiss i guess the mortages are already at around 0%. As there central bank has a negative rate. So even a 0% mortage is "profitable" for banks and their only way to not lose money.
And central banks/governments drive interest lower, America can't already keep the interest at 2ish %. EU has still around 0% interest, how on earth the financial market can be "stimulated"? The only way is to go deeper into debt, print more money and drive interest rates down to let people consume on those negative interest rates.
If we concider the current state of financial world with 14T negative bond debt, trillions of consumers credit at 0% interest, etc etc, it is a miracle that bitcoin is trading at just $10k. It probably shoots up to $100k in no time in the next few years.

In the US? The whole world has done QE programs.. The reason this bond yield is diving to zero is because for years the central bank has been buying up all bonds regardless of any interest rate.
And he is right, even consumer debts are going the negative direction (getting paid to borrow), with this speed we are heading.

I didn't post that.
And yes it does. You could have bought bitcoin at 0.01$ as well, but you decided to videogame/smoke weed/drink alchohol/watch tv or whatever.
Bitcoin rewards those who hold. In the current system holders of fiat gets punished while a small group of people get rewarded extreme well (big property owners, stock holders, bankers, those who work in these industries, etc etc).
There is nothing wrong with people who got rich by getting in early (Bill Gates stock potition), but everything is wrong with people creating their own rich world (Rotschilds and other banking families).
Bitcoin stopped this inequality, everyone can mine, everyone can run a node, everyone can buy/sell. And you can get the same percentage profits as SN gets.

It is only volatile in your fiat and your calculations. I own a xx amount of bitcoin satoshi's and they aren't volatile. They staid exactly the same since i bought them and didn't move a bit.
Bitcoin will grow way bigger then today, but that will not be in one flat lat of 0,xx% per day. That will be with day of 10+% and -10% the next day. 
Tell me, how you can have no volatility as long as there are economist who say that it goes to zero and bitcoin buyers who say it is going to $1 million (and supporting that outcome as they buy up the available supply).
What you have in mind is impossible, even fiats are volatile. Look at the usd euro graph of the past 20 years to get an idea. This is two major currencies with fairly similar stats. And yet the currency exchange rate bounces at all sides.
@_date: 2019-08-14 16:28:17
Learn what speculation is and why it is good.


Yes, and this is very valuable to me. As i very much so like to keep what i have. And yes, i do speculate on the fact that others value it at the same price or even higher. Exactly how we RE value for example.








This is A Bob's problem as he trusted USDT. And B Finex as they will have to pay back the line of credit and sell assets to do so.
It's like saying bitcoin is backed by creditcard companies as some people use creditcards to purchase bitcoin. Sure it is not good that people do this. But people like to speculate on speculative assets. That is in every business/market. The people get rekt if things go wrong. In worst case scenario bitcoin goes down (Which is favorable by others who buy the cheap coin).
@_date: 2019-08-22 21:52:39


That i totally agree with. In my country the wages stagnated since the 80's! While house prices have like trippled or so.


Totally, the same here. And there is always a fresh supply of new (immigrants) workers who fill those low paid jobs, so why raise it?  While the middle class becomes smaller and smaller as everyone hunt for the same jobs. So also those wages don't have to rise.

Next year the bitcoin supply rate increase will be the lowest together with gold (so below any fiat and/or metal), sure the world is gonna notice that.


And that will happen very likely. Both fluctuate and appreciate. And since that the appreciation is a self fulfilling prohecy the currencies will start to notice it at some point (too big of an outflow will occur).

No bitcoin's supply is actually inflationairy for the longest time (although less every halvening). 
Our current debt based fiat system indeed needs inflation, otherwise the system would implode, hence why you hear banksters say that 2% inflation is needed.
In reality a currency doesn't need inflation nor deflation, it is just what we think off it. Yes in dollar and other fiat terms bitcoin will go to an infinite high level once (see weimar germany how quickly that can go).
You should indeed bitcoin hold as long as possible, as it will gain in value over time. But last time i checked humans still need to eat, so spending is unavoidable, and most people also like to spent money on actually living.
But you are right, bitcoin has an incentive to hold, there is nothing wrong with that. If people want your bitcoin to invest for something better they even give you interest for the risk you will take (instead of this negative interst because you can just print more money bullshit).
4) 
Do you mind if your bitcoin become worth more as your neighbour lost his? Me not. See it as Van Gogh paintings, if 1 burns down the others are becoming even more rare. Bitcoin has always enough units to function as even 1 bitcoin can still be devided endlessly.
Do some education about (central) banks, history, fiat money, gold, inflation, imf/worldbank, etc.

Exactly. Basic income for the rich.
It doesn't stimulate the economy as most already live from pay check to pay check. Giving them a smaller purchasing power can't bring more economy activity.

You are confused here. It is actually not the exchange that holds your money, the exchange is simply waiting for your bank to send the money over to them. This can take up days and sometimes even weeks.
Banks hold your money onto their books for a while so they can gain interest or just make their books a little better (a better reserve ratio). You should definetely talk to your bank ans ask if they can stop this madness, if not try to find a better bank.
As long as the exchange didn't receive the fake cash (fiat money), they will not let you send hard cash (bitcoin) out of course, that would be very stupid!
To be clear, if i sent a SEPA wire to coinbase it arrives in 2-4 hours on a business day, so i can buy and send the bitcoin away without any problems.

Many of the of the biggest companies started by people with little or no high education. They did all the jobs from cleaning to being a multi billionaire CEO. 
How it is possible that they can do so well while all the wage slaves needs to be certified to do a very small piece of that work? It is only the fetish for higher education (while the quality of that education in general is hollowed out).

Inflation is in general created by corrupted people. Inflation takes money from people without them doing anything against it. Inflation causes often that people lose purchasing power.
How on earth a lower purchasing power creates more spendings?

1. Yes you need to make a transaction and add fees. This transaction ends up in the mempool.  here you can see some mempool stats. Basically miners take the transactions with the highest fees. So a high sat/byte tx fee means you will be "mined" by miners soon (the next time miners find a new bitcoin block).
If your transaction isn't mined or miners don't find new blocks the transction doesn't get confimations indeed.

This question has been asked many times by now. No one really knows as bitcoin need to stand the first crisis, we can all think of many things, but the market moves in odd directions at such times (a clever government/cb could use it as an easy time to attack bitcoin hard). 
Likely though, a short term squeeze, people run for fiat (dollars). Everything else gets sold. But hard to say if this is true, many btc holders are in for the long haul and pretty well educated/financially stably. And after all what is a -50% really for bitcoin by now? We have seen them often.
After the first panic is over we probably will see the biggest bull run in bitcoins history. As central bankers have little control, banks are very untrusted (still), governments lack knowledge about anyhting. People aren''t stupid, they will put their money to safety. If bitcoin starts to rise people will notice and jump in as well. (Together with failing banks, liquidity problems, etc etc) This is going to be huge! Keep at least some bitcoin just in case!
@_date: 2019-08-10 18:24:46

Oh i do follow him and seen almost all his videos.
But i still wonder how he sometimes so easy flips out that the tech is more important then the value of bitcoin. If you don't really care about the value of a coin the USD actually also works great. Everyone accepts it and in general functions very well.
But USD isn't great as it inflates a lot of value from the bag holders to its owners and some wealthy people.
Bitcoin is great tech and i appreciate how he makes this easily understandable to us, but the "price" is a big part of it to let this bitcoin work.

Derivatives in itself are pretty useful actually like you write down (that is a bit speculative already though). Or in the potato farmer, fries manufater kind of way it is a perfect solution and it makes the overall market better.
1 - yes
2 - correct
3 - Exactly
The problem is not really Derivatives indeed, but the way some parties started to use those and make extreme speculative tools, with no over sight, no rules, almost no one who actually even has the slighest idea about the whole product anymore.
And i bet that is the biggest part of those Derivatives market, it allows banks and other parties to do whatever they like and act like financial wizzards.

What they basically do is front run the interest rate downward spike which will be pushed by central banks.  
Lets say the bond has a yield of -1% and it goes to -3% within a year the gains are still decent. Doesn't look this whole idea and market picture any better though.

It lowers in purchasing power, exactly why bitcoin was created: 1BTC = 1 BTC , in 2009 and will be the same in 2090.
A fiat debt based usd system needs inflation to not implode, so a guaranteed loss for usd holders at any cost (they will do whatever it takes to reach that goal, print money, buy debts, lower debt requirements, interest manipulation, political manipulation, and on and on).


Do they teach that about gold right now? Government sponsored education only give out education they seem fit.

Exactly! And there is so much to learn about bitcoin. Also it is really interesting stuff, powerful and for a better cause!
@_date: 2019-08-05 07:53:33
Because many "traders" or wannabe traders set price levels. So there are stoplosses and buyins at certain level. Price reaches X? A lot of Y actions are done (automatically).
For example when we broke above $11k you see a massive candle as many automatic orders were around that level. So this quikcly pushes it to the next "resistance".
All TA crap and imaginary seing things on charts which aren't there. Focus on fundamentals, play long game hodl. Look at long cycles (years). Learn as much as you can about bitcoin/money. The short term price isn't important.

Bitcoin has mostly been trading seperatly from any asset, don't know whcih study you have been watching.
Also if you see the gold and bitcoin move of this year they are almost identical (bitcoin moving first actually). So not sure i can follow your argument there either.


That is always at the height of a cycle -.-


Indeed EU is in internal problems since forever and still dealing with huge capital flows from the north to support the rest. It's becomming a sad joke by now.


Lolled right there.


Not unlikely they are going apeshit already. September they will introduce some new crap. They plan a 100 billion fund to buy more garbage already. NL alone also is thinking about a 50 bill fund (what a surprise, keep the fantasy of one big EU going as long as possible at any cost).


Not true though, Only in BE &amp; NL there is already 750$ billion in bank savings, this easily could outweight the bitcoin outflows when shit hits the fans. Bitcoin is really tiny still and if shit haoppens the liquidations in bitcoin easily could be bought up by capital which is trying to hide for a collapse. (We don't know yet what will happen though).


Simply said we don't know yet, it can go anyway and much depends on the kind of recession we will get in. If we get a banking crisis (which is likely), bitcoin will do very well.

@_date: 2019-08-12 09:26:23
Exactly. If bitcoin really succeeds it is better to buy bitcoin then speculate on companies. Even if you buy in let say 10-20 years from now.
Before we reached a price per bitcoin the world economy is stable enough to run on will take many decades and a price point few people can forsee right now.
It is also a good thing for the stockmarket though. Because bad companies will go bust and only good creative companies who actually create wealth will stay above. That's the power of a currency which isn't inflated (so were even negative yield still can outperform).
And lets not even talk what bitcoin will do to sovereign debts and their policies.

1 Bitcoin = 100.000.000 Satoshi's.
How you value a dollar?
In all seriousness you could look at S2F ratio. 100trillionusd has a good posts/tweets about that. You can compare bitcoin with gold (~$350k per bitcoin). You can compare it to money, housing market (has big part of SoV priced in).

Yes strictly seen we give advice while we ourself get better off from it as we hold bitcoin and a higher price will do us well. But fortunately i see not much bad advice around this sub, most people honstely tell how things are regardless of their own benefits, most actually warn you for many pitfalls in this space.

And communism is no socialism. And capitalisitic free market with a dark central power who created and controls the money is not a free market. We can go on and on about names which not belong to each other. 


Taxes are "okish", not low but you get back a fair share. And it is pretty sustainable as many countries have far lower debts then USA for example.


Agreed, but unlikely. We never learn anything unfortunately.
I feel pretty enslaved even in my capi/soci country with one of the best conditions in history. I think we never really can solve that problem, even with a total bitcoin society.

I see 20% but okay, a government given CPI indeed is very thrustworthy source to control how much you have been stolen by. If you look at your expenses you probably notice some total different picture.


Of course, as the whole world protects themselves by going long in dollar and short in their local shitcoin. Imagine if a part of that money goes to bitcoin?

With bitcoin anyone can be a Swiss Banker -.-
It can even be stored in your normal bank (hardware wallet), without anyone knowing it.

If you cut one meter in smaller pieces (milimeters), do you get more meters?
Central banks are printing extra meters, bitcoin just devide the one unit into smaller pieces, a small yet very big difference.
By central banks your unit gets deliluted, as your unit gets multiplied. When you device the measurement of your unit, your unit actually stays the same.
For example, there are 21 million bitcoin. Lets skip 50 years, many people lost their bitcoin. In fact so many that there are only 2 left, 1 is divivded by all the people. And the other one is yours, as you kept it very very secure. Basically you now own 50% of all the bitcoin which are in use!

In hindsight it is always easy. That's why DCA works so well. It help you just buy  eve when it doens't seem "right".
But i surely hit some extra purchases just in case when we went below 5k$. I also wish i was brave enough to go deeper in. As i felt bitcoin is coming back and 3k$ felt like the bottom to me.
To be honest i think even now at 9k-11k area it isn't that bad of an entree. Looks a lot like the new bull is in town.

I don't expect anything without proofs.. Why you would think that a company that can't have enough dollars to back its stable coin to be able to stack bitcoin?


It is much easier to do with tether. You just write a FUD article about tether is bad, hire some online actors and viola price of tether sinks and they can buy them back for 80 cents per dollar. Easy money making scheme.


Because new money enters the game. Bitcoin is very limited, the amount of bitcoin changing hands on a daily/monthly basis is even way smaller. If 1 billion dollars of new money which going to play the arbitrage/market makers game of course you get a squeeze upwards in the price. How else you would expect a tight market to work? Bitcoin is not liquid enough to billions of new dollars or thousnads of btc dumps (mt gox dump). If those things happen the price drastically increase/decrease.


Don't use it nor the platforms who have/use usdt. Keep bitcoin on your hardware wallet and nothing (NOTHING) will happen to it. If it is really a scam they will go down sooner or later.

The only difference is that the farmer would not have any seeds left. While those central bankers can just create an endless amount of new money. Or even invent a total different currency if the first one doesn't work anymore.
As long as you keep this power in the hands of (central) bankers and politicians we are continue seeing the same thing over and over again. (Power, wars., easy money, downfalls, inflated recoveries).
It is almost uninmaginable that we have a global network of internet, we can order things from China, we can put people, cars and telescopes in space.
But yet we keep making the same mistakes and couldn't figure out a way to run our money system.

HAHA, that is very reassuring :) Better go look for a better job now the market is still okish! Maybe you can get some job more related to this industry?
But i see now in EU that they tighten very much the rules for cash. (lower limits, paying for withdrawing/deposting cash, lets ATM's etc). Right now the interest rates in banks is 0.03%. One car lease company with a bank license gives .2% and that's it. But the rates are still dropping slowly. They have been this low for years, but somehow they are i think scared to go negative. 
Real returns already deep red though calculating with the inflation rate of 3.x% and wealth tax (above 25k) of 1.5%. But most people have no savings so they don't understand this problem.

Wow you certainly have a large size in art, antiques and antiquities. I don't know much about that market so i guess it is best to stay away from it haha.
If you don't know much about stocks and don't really want to take risks you could always DCA and buy the index. Even if you start now and buy all the way through a crash it would probably deliver you a return which is hard to beat (watch what DCA would brought you if you started in 2016).
But bitcoin probably still is this one of a lifetime chances with a very good risk reward ratio. It certainly is risky, but if it works the rewards will be tremendous. Hence i allocated a (way too big) portion to it lol. But i feel very confident about the bitcoin holdings. Much better then the stocks to be honest.

So that people can earn bitcoin and save it regardless of becoming a full time stock broker to keep the wealth they did earn in the past. Instead of it being inflated away in a few years time.

Most of the people who buy bitcoin have a pretty decent financial position/education.
Why else we are wasting money on buying our "insurrance" right now you think? Sure people will sell for their daily needs. But there probably is a bigger part of people who want to protect their wealth against new problems in the financial market.
Although it is still a big guess of course, if one really would know for certain right now how btc will react it is a free ticket to extreme wealth.

I know there is a lot of money. And probably will keep flowing in.
But look, the money isn't than flowing anymore in bitcoin but in worthless derivatives. Do you really think that all those gold derivative buyers understand that they don't own gold but just some claim on gold?
If the supply of bitcoin gets unlimited in this way the market doesn't really go higher anymore and banksters get power like they always do.
Look how easily people buy "bitcoin" at etorro or Robinhood. They aren't buying real bitcoin, they just buy paper claims. That supply is endless.

I think many people don't really bother by their own life choices and unhappyness but by how the world is in general. I can for example figure my life out and live "happy". 
But to do that i for example have to ignore the unhappy life for millions of millions of people caused by the American war machine. Sure i can watch movies, play football, work hard and do everything to be happy myself and ignore all the bad things. But many are just too clever to do that. And the more you understand about how the sytem works, the more fustrated you get from it.
Another example, many now happy people life's will be destroyed in the next financial crisis. It is easily forseable. It will hurt and even kill many people accross the globe. Sure i can be happy from my gains and look away. But the fault which is created doens't make me happy. It makes me angry that it goes in this way. SN created us a new tool which look very promissing to fight exactly against this, but for most people it will simply not help this time. Maybe next time, so that is something very positive and to work hard for and making it work!


I think that has a lot to do with the level of education. Living a simple life without understanding much and no desire to change that makes life simple and yet rewarding.

You are confused here. It is actually not the exchange that holds your money, the exchange is simply waiting for your bank to send the money over to them. This can take up days and sometimes even weeks.
Banks hold your money onto their books for a while so they can gain interest or just make their books a little better (a better reserve ratio). You should definetely talk to your bank ans ask if they can stop this madness, if not try to find a better bank.
As long as the exchange didn't receive the fake cash (fiat money), they will not let you send hard cash (bitcoin) out of course, that would be very stupid!
To be clear, if i sent a SEPA wire to coinbase it arrives in 2-4 hours on a business day, so i can buy and send the bitcoin away without any problems.

He just makes observations and indeed banks on it. What's wrong about that? A capitalistic market should work in that way, it will create an efficient market.
He agrees that the central banks did right indeed, and imo he is right. Don't forget that the central bank has to act in a way which is good for the system in general.
Lets be honest, how bad 2008 was, they managed to get us here without too much damage. Although we don't like the working of the market, who knows how it goes when central banks didn't interfere.
The best would be a total reform, but even then. Who says that a bitcoin system in which you can't stimulate the market really works? Crisis under a full gold reserve were severe and very difficult to get out of (often ended with war, see EU).

Yes, some big players just play against all those high leveraged "investors". They squeeze them out of the market by triggering stoplosses (both long and short).

Stock market crash is more a financial crash. Everything goes down, from stocks to houses etc. Consumers start to save more and spent less. Less employement, less government income.
Our current system only works when it grows, as soon as it declines there is a chance it will implode. Because let say you earn less while your spendings are the same, at one point you get in trouble. This counts both for companies as for people.
What will happen in such times is that all the capital moves out of assets and into USD and gold. Now this time (most likely) also some capital will flow into bitcoin to hide for the crash.
There is a lot of money in houses, stocks and even savings in bank accounts are loaded. Think many trillions. So there is a chance that bitcoin (worth around 200 billion) can profit from this a lot, giving it the best place to store your wealth.

Who knows what they will do this time, 50% bail-ins, bail outs, QE's, minus 3% interest, ban cash, you can't forsee their actions, which is one big plus for bitcoin as it is very clear what will happen with it.
If you think that nothing will happen in the coming 5 years and that the world will stay as it is you will have a big surprise coming. Sure the USD may still keep it's importance, but it is likely that the whole fiat/debt system as we know it will shaken way more than in 2008.

Partly i think he is right. The biggest threat is derivatives and those banksters products which will take over the market pricing mechanism and totally surprise the real bitcoin market.
On the other side, with gold you pretty much need a custodial, so banks, governments, central banks, imf, pension funds all need to store there gold. Which gives it a perfect big stock to use for speculate derivatives.
With bitcoin you could more easily store bitcoin for yourself, making the available supply for those derivatives much smaller. Plus you could even create custodials who only have a part of the key, so they never fully have your bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-05 16:50:55
Basically you make up how much you want to invest from your paycheck for example. Or every week $10. You can totally set it up how you would like.
But what it ends up is an average purchase price over longer time, so you don't really pay the highest nor the lowest price. But over a long time such price difference anyway don't make a big difference.
Let say you have $10.000 to invest you could choose for example to invest 2000 every month or the other month. 
Or in a bull market like now, save money and buy every pullback (like we had seen in the last month).

At the end of 2021 we will already been through the next bubble phase. I think the bull is already well on its way, the closer we come to the halvening the higher we get. This time also bigger money will play this game. We will reach an ATH anywhere from 100k-400k. And approx 12 monts after the halvening we start the decline. At the end of 2021 we are well into a bear market and somewhere between 15k-60k.

Isn't anyone thinking this by now? Be contrarian lol.


There isn't. And why you would lent him such money if basically you take the risk anyway?
Building plots most likely are also overvalued if anything else is. I don't know about your financial position (besides the cash). You could pm about it if you want to talk about it privately, or not. Inflation certainly is eating away part of the money. But look at it from the other side, basically you see a stock crash coming. So let say it is in now and three years, this means that around 6% will be eaten away by inflation, but the stocks probably crash harder. The real problem is thought that a stock crash might not be coming, i have hodled cash for way too long as i always hoped for a crash, yet the stock market went a x fold and basically i lost so much money by just "waiting".

Yes that might be a good idea, but that should also depend about many factors.
Just trading your golden egg to some bad preforming risky assets like RE is not that smart. Let say you bought at $1 and sold half at $100 to better deversify. You totally missed another 2x your previous gains. And very likely still many more in the future.
But some deversification is never wrong of course. Keeping 100% in bitcoin might be not a good plan :p

Bitcoin holding is probably the biggest investion/usecase humans ever seen in history. Saving your wealth/worked time for the future is something good and necessary.
1 BTC = 1 BTC, now and in one hundred years. So in the long term it is expected to see an increase in fiat price, hence why people rather hold bitcoin instead of fiat. (Hodl bitcoin and spent your fiat).
Buying things with bitcoin can be a good thing when it is easy, accepted, low cost. Almost in any case this is not true, so there is much work to do still.

Miners get the fee on top of the coinbase reward. So the reward drops in half but the fees are not necessarily changing.
The only thing that has to change for miners to stay profitable is a double in price. If the price lets say not doubles but only halfs, the total reward for miners shrinks. So they will get less bitcoin and could pay less for electricty.
Lets say the price doesn't change at all. Then the reward drops by ~$65k (@ todays prices) for every block which will be found. That is significant.

Yes, but the bitcoin price is the same across all platforms (i wish it wasn't lol).
So your argument isn't really valid. As conbase may not be involved themselves, their price indication is though. (Cross platform arbitrage makes the price extreme similar).

No it gives people an idea how small bitcoin is. $11.000 seems a lot to many people. $207.000.000.000 Seems even like more!
So many zeros!
But that number took the ECB about 3 monhts to print for many years. Every quarter a current total value of bitcoin was printed! If you compare it to other assets you can start to see a better picture.

Not really a fact. Maybe then we have other machines which can do more mining at lower kw/h cost. So keeping the same security at a lower cost.
I am not sure there has been much study behind how price, txes, fees, mining power , security threshold actually is needed to let bitcoin work. It is a wide range for sure. But i am not sure what are some "limits".

Some quick information about some good sources, it is best to do your own research.
 - great videos to give you a good understanding of what bitcoin is. Highly recommend it to watch at least some of his conferences.
The book: "The Bitcoin Standard" from author Saifedean Ammous - it will give you a better understanding of what money is!
If you really got into it this far, there is another great source to entertain yourself even longer!: 
Also just buy firstly a small amount of bitcoin to start with and learn more about it (10$ is already plenty!). Buy it on an exchange to see how that works. 
Then just send it to your wallet, Electrum wallet for example. Send it around a bit to get to know bitcoin and how it works, 
learn about how the transaction fees for sending a transaction work:  . Make for example a small donation to wikileaks

A higher bitcoin value basically is a number which puts out a higher network effect. It's a Self-fulfilling prophecy.

What is the direct and indirect dead toll of capitalism? Throwing random numbers without comparing these is really useless.


We all know that person who doesn't want to share. Who cares? In the many countries i have seen baggers on the street by old people, children, disabled etc. I rather pay money through the tax system so that those people can have a "normal" life than to look away from it. It really is one of those things which makes living in western EU far more superior then about anywhere else in the world. Sure some people rather would build fortifications to protect themselves and step over the beggers in the city. Not my kind of life.


If you see all the stressed and depressed people around the world it is hard to claim such things. Many people live a unhappy unfulfilling life and are feeling useless. The worst of all is that the system feeds blaiming/guiltyiness so people keep being stuck where they are at. And there are certainly better solutions than modern capitalism debt enslavement and labor force camps. I hope you can envision such world...

Try to find that SD card. 
Also usb like devices are used for storing bitcoin. Find images from Hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor, if he has such device somewhere most likely the bitcoin is stored on those devices.
Bitcoin is using special keys (seed words). If you come across a 12 or 24 word list it is very much likely the key to the bitcoin. Never give someone those words though! The words could (should) be written on paper, but could be in his email, on his pc, on that sd card, or anywhere else.
Also there are file names like "wallet.dat" which could hold bitcoin.
Some computer searches should be done: Ledger, Ledger live, Electrum, bitcoin, seed words, wallet
 
Here are common wallets to look for:
Bitcoin often is stored on exchanges too. Try to look in his emails and on the bank records. Companies like Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, Bitstamp are often used for did and could easily store bitcoin or just money. Try to find as much details as possible!

So let say a Venezualian holds $100k. In one year at a 2% inflation rate America basically got a free $2000 from 1 Venezualian citizen.
Now think about all the billions of dollars around the world who hold dollars for the same exact reason. And America just keeps printing those worthless dollars and exporting them abroad.

Yes i understand this. So if the appreciation and income is lower than the expected return on bitcoin i do think that there will be a big gain in bitcoin and a (small) decrease in RE. 


Not true. Lower classes don't gain from RE in general. Middle class to certain degree, but in my country they start to sell 40 year mortgages based on two saleries for people to be able to buy a house. Of course those people will never gain from their "wealth" in the RE.
I don't know where you live, but here in west EU there is a whole big conflict with not normal people buying houses, but rich people. And the government tries to keep the supply tight so they bid up prices like crazy in booms.
BTW i don't think this happens overnight or something. I do think it takes at least a decade and much more likely even longer. But that isn't bad and i have the patience to wait and build. For now i am mostly interested in seeing bitcoin stand against a financial crisis. Beating the USD or even replacing it 100% is far far away.

But i do think that collectible money is very old no? Metals has been used at least thousands of years by now.

@_date: 2019-08-09 08:02:19
Start with some wallets on your computer (Electrum) but learn to do it safely. There are many scams/phishing etc. Or try one of the many mobile wallets.
When your investment becomes big that you start to worry about it, buy a hardware wallet. For $100, i wouldn't invest another $100 in hardware wallet. Better take some risk (be secure!) and invest the 100 in bitcoin, that makes much more sense!
@_date: 2019-08-07 08:31:09
Winner winner chicken dinner.
Before what happened was that the USA destabalized a country and ironically enough the citizens in those countries often start to fall back on the USD, making the dollar stronger plus they basically profit from doing such kind of things. When they start to hide in bitcoin it doesn't strengthen the dollar anymore and evenetually even weakening it!
I can't wait before the first country to go full scale on bitcoin. (Countries which are under attack haven't much to lose anyway). I still put my money on iran or NK, maybe Russia (but i think they will do it quietly).

Sure, most people will go rekter than rekt in the next economic down turn. Many people will get their savings haircutted by bank bail ins. People can't get money out of banks (Greece), more/lower ban on cash.
Bitcoin will get major publicity through this. Imagine being in a crisis and observing that bitcoiners have no problems, all the while they getting majorly rich by having stored their wealth in bitcoin instead of failing banks.
People will learn rather quickly in such situations.

Gold/silver wasn't volatile for thousands of years.
Sure when the mines of Potosi for example were found it had a surpression on the markets as suddenly a big new inflight of silver came on the markets.
But what you are looking at is gold pricedin fiat money. The fractional reserve fake paper money is volatile not the gold itself.
FYI gold is heavily manipulated by the banksters who print those worthless paper money (what a suprise).

In this paper they write about inflation and a negative interest rate to push the economy further as we already have zero interest and they still like to do rate cuts. So to go deep negative.
But reading throughout the paper i feel like we (the workers) are being used like cattle. It's a way too optimize our productions in ways we do with our cattle. The way to creating a maximium ouput by the working force, all to consume more and more.
It's the opposite of reading the whitepaper which favours the holder.

@_date: 2019-06-07 23:23:44


True. Lots of demands come from foreign countries, betting on the saffest assets aka dollars.
Now imagine if something even saver is around! Not that i think the whole world will load on bitcoin, but a small percentage of those dollar flighters can fly into bitcoin for sure. And if bitcoin goes up in a bear market it easily can be a Self-fulfilling prophecy.


I'm not talking about such people. NL + BE for example have 750$ billion of cash sitting on banks at zero % interest, that is 4x the btc marketcap! That are just two small countries in a world full of unequal wealth. That wealth can easily move around in case of severe financial crisis and an instable banking system.
I'm certainly not 100% sure, but i do see a higher possibilty bitcoin would actually function as a run to asset and not a dump asap asset.
@_date: 2019-10-21 11:41:15
People in geopolitical instable countries often were buying euros and dollars (so they are actually fulling their own demise).
Wait till many people indeed start using bitcoin for this reason, which it clearly is capable of preforming really well under such circumstances.
I think the next crisis might be a validation of bitcoin and really create a bull market we have never seen before.

@_date: 2019-06-08 22:51:58




If you think it isn't its fine by me, the market will proof who is right.


Yes it will.


Correct, but it will lower the demand and reduces price, and especially if you calculate it in bitcoin terms. So it takes value (a lot).


Currently bitcoin is worth $7.5k. But it is likely going to increase thousands of percentage over the next decades. Meanwhile RE will raise at 2-6% a year. 
At this moment a lot of wealth goes out of fiat in search for return and goes into RE. Partly to keep it safe, mostly because it searches return. But RE is much less secure and solid then bitcoin. Most of the RE market isn't valued by real demand, it is because governments keep the supply artificially low. Over the coming years more and more people will wake up about the bitcoin price increase year after year and will sell houses or just not buy houses anymore (for the SoV part or the rent seeking), so the demand will go down and the prices will follow.
That money will likely flow into bitcoin creating a self fulfilling prophecy.

In some countries there is also a gift tax (in mine for example). After the first free 2000€ you start to pay income tax on the gift as well.
Besides that if your 100$ becomes worth 1 million, most definetly your friend needs to pay tax on the capital gains (depends totally on the country and tax structure though, for example i don't have to pay capital gain taxes in this case).

People work and create value and they would like to store this for later or for future generations. They way the world workd for at least 5000 years. I think you don't really understand money &lt;&gt; wealth &lt;&gt; SoV


Bitcoin is, but it can capture value of non liquid assets. So you can't compare only the liquid assets of todays world (fiat currency for example), you could include more. That those current assets aren't liquid and bitcoin is liquid doesn't matter of course.

The Turkey feels pretty happy by being fed for thousand days. He sees human as some brilliant creature to give him food every day and take care of the bird.
What he doesn't realize is that what is happening at the 1001 day. He is going to the butcher and gets killed. After all the human wasn't so good for him and only took care of the Turkey for creating food for the human.
Often humans also don't really know/have/see all the information. Don't be the Turkey, see and look out for changes.

Probably just find another exchange or bank to make your buying go smoother.
It depends also on the currency and/or country. You should search for the best option in your case (which isn't necessarilythe best one i use).
But right now your bank isn't really directly wiring the money over to Coinbase, hence why they hold your bitcoins until the money is really 100% in their bank.

Gold derives its (current) value from the monetary aspect. No other precious metal does that.
You think that it is easy to change a netwerk effect. Right now the USD is the number one fiat, maybe (or certainly) it is not the best fiat currency, but because multiple reasons it is and probably stays (at least until some very big changes) the number 1 fiat currency.
Deversifying in other crypto is a stupid idea, if you don't trust bitcoin you could rather not invest in any crypto. If you think bitcoin will not survive and their will be a new "better" one soon. There will be never any value like gold has. Because there always will be a change that there is yet again a "better" crypto.
There is really only one change for bitcoin/crytpo to succeed. I would defintely not bet my money on the next "better" crypto.
Maybe you will understand it better with paintings. There are paintings out there going for 10 million+ right now. While you can easily paint a new painting, there are painters who can even improve the Mona Lisa for example. But yet that copy is hardly worth the paint and the paper. While the orginal one is still worth millions. That is why bitcoin and painting has value, because they are scarce and can't be duplicated.

Exactly making it only go quicker this time. Imagine a greek or Cyprian bank but now with a very easy and well known outflow to bitcoin. Good luck for a bankrun last longer then a day. 
Sure things don't happen  necessarily in a day and people do have "time". But the problem is, when bitcoin (and other assets) start gaining 100% per day, how many really do understand what's going on and swap intime before we are at the top of a hyperbolic chart and all euros already hyperinflated.
Sure i understand that the euro isn't so bad and it is much more likely that Germany and other countries act (go back to Dmark or some other currency) before it is too late.

I think to bootstrap bitcoin it needed an intial big supply, but you can't really just start with millions of coins out of nothing (alt coins shown this by now).
So by making this supply curve go from high (50 btc every 10 minutes) to zero. It made bitcoins worthless at the beginning, but a fun gimmick to get. So people started to put some computer power to it (just for the lolz).
Over time the demand should increase (at least that is what he hoped of course), while the supply started to decrease. And then suddenly everyone finds themselves in a not stoppable Self-Fulfilling Prophecy which really made bitcoin succeed (in my opinion).
I think it was very well thought of, but also at times a bit random or just some math and guesstimate. As to why every 4 years? Why 21 million? Why start with 50? Why halvings every four years and in any other form?
@_date: 2019-06-26 11:30:57

The next halvening will kick us through the 1T mark (a pretty impressive goal i do think).
After that bitcoin's market cap soon gains a higher price then the biggest public company, which is really a big and weird accomplishment in just 10 ish years and our capitalistic system.
From that moment on i do think things will get weird. As bitcoin no longer can be that ignored small thing which seems just not to die after all. Big boys then can't no longer ignore it and we probably will see the biggest money swift in human history.

The government is creating ~6% of USD every year out of nothing. Not bitcoin is unsustainable, that model is unsustainable.
Actually the US government is creating those dollars out of nothing and they are obliged to pay interest over it to the Federal Reserve, interest that never can be paid back without the supply of USD to continue to grow. How you can otherwise pay interest over the total amount of USD out there?

Yes another big advantage to choose bitcoin over houses.
Your house is valuable because of the land in a certain area. Which the government is very likely to tax until you are broke yet again.
If you don't like the tax on your bitcoin you could simply hide them (maybe not so legal). Or just take your 12 words with you and move (or at least  move on paper). A very lucrative way to move your wealth to a place who has the best interest for your wealth.

Because bitcoin is a store of value.
People buy all kinds of things to store value (houses, paintings, gold, silver, other PM's, land, stocks).
Capturing value wouldn't stop at the current "money" part. Bitcoin will capture all kinds of wealth in the end.

I thought you were under the impression that it wasn't possible, and now u suddenly want to argue about that it is not possible. But why argue about that if it is not possible to begin with?


Do you even know what you're arguing about?
I think you missunderstand how much currency there is. Besides that, if bitcoin becomes the currency it doesn't stop at $400-$700k. 
Bitcoin will be the new currency and it will create new value (so in old dollar terms it will generate much more value in the next centuries).
That is why i told that bitcoin will take value from the RE market. As bitcoin itself will be more valueble to hold then a house. So instead of buying a house people will hold a full bitcoin. But i see that you can't even comprehend value in asset A compared to value in Asset B without going through a fiat currency.
BTW, you do realize that while arguing starting to swear will not make you win the argument but does let you look very stupid right?

How you can calculate the price rate if the other currency is gone? Why you still think in dollar terms. You do understand that dollars nerver meant to last and will be replaced by something else, if not bitcoin, something else for sure!


This is so wrong on so many levels. Study history my friend, the evens we will see have happened countless times before. You think in linear scaling, while the dollar devalues in exponential scale. The last dollars will go away for satoshis. No one even cares at such moment about dollars anymore..

There are enough big companies that do accept bitcoin already (if you didn't know that).
I think Emupark was joking a bit about this though, but he is getting at that US blocks Iran from trading, while bitcoin could easily bypass such blocks.
Sure, those large oil companies might not accept bitcoin instore. But they do about anything to pay for the oil they buy (they like more business you know).
For example, Royal Dutch Shell used to ship grain or other argiculure goods to Iran, so they paid in this way, until USA also bitched about that.
Another story i heard (not sure if true), is that on a daily basis gold was brought from Dubai to Iran (to pay also for oil).
Imagine now, is it really far fetched that those oil companies start to use bitcoin to buy some of the black gold? I'm not saying that they are. But it defi is one of the best/easiest options out there right now.

You should have received a fresh Ledger which doesn't have any wallet installed (so no pass phrase).
Anyway you can reset the Ledger by typing three times the wrong pincode.
I think you actually talk about the seed words. I'm not sure an average user really can know if the manufacture preinstalled those keys. If you don't trust Ledger i think it is best not to buy it.
Alternatively you can create your own seed (somewhere else) and just recover it on the ledger.

You should learn about bitcoin/fiat more i suppose.
What you (as a long term holder for this thought experience) will start to do with millions in fiat? Hodl fiat from now on? 
Sure there will be rebalacing, some might even sell all. But the difference between bitcoin not being a ponzi scheme is that there will be more demand for bitcoin, so eventually it will just get spread.
Not everyone will sell all bitcoin and say goodbye to bitcoin, otherwise it would have stopped after the first second or third bubble.

@_date: 2019-10-13 17:45:16
Yes they can print new money by just making new debts (which they create by themselves).
So whenever there needs to be done a big payment, they could just print more money. 
There is also debt roll over, when you never really pay of the debt (countries do it all the time). Let say country X borrows 1 billion at 2% for one year. After one year they just again borrow 1 billion at (maybe again) 2% for one year and pay with the new debt the old debtors. This is probably mainly why debts never get reduced, its too tempting to just create new debt (and more) instead of ever paying the bill.

School classes and the study materials are build for average people. And i can kind of understand it why. But it doesn't fit many who aren't average. This does have severe consequences. 
Often it isn't even clear for the teachers nor for the children/parents that some children are really intelligent and they are "trouble", not because they can't learn. Just because the current setup doesn't fit them.
It is super sad.

That's why we need to pay fees. I think we pay around 1 btc per block in fees at the moment. But i don't really know a good source for that.
So the fee market need to become the source which should pay to cover mining cost. (Remember that mining is a flexible mechanism though, so it isn't a very strict setup needed, it adjusts itself).
So that is why OP is talking about "negligible", no one cares at that moment about the coinbase anymore, the fees should rake in more bitcoin and everyone is still happy.

The risks to financial stability are increasing due to low interest rates and ample liquidity ratios. As a result, financial markets are developing exuberantly and there is no incentive to reduce debts. Once sentiment changes, this can jeopardize financial stability. This is stated in the semi-annual Financial Stability (OFS) published by De Nederlandsche Bank today. This OFS will be explained by DNB president Klaas Knot on 12 June in a public conversation with the Standing Chamber Committee for Finance.

I understand how the fractional reserve system works. How capital would like to fly back to be safe too, so many will sell their investments and go in USD.
But bitcoin is worth just 150 Billions USD. That really is NOTHING in the grand scheme of things. Thats why i imagine that capital inflow for safety could easily outweigh the outflow from the beginning. 
Imagine seeing a bank fail (like we did in Cyprus) or one of the countless other banks. If only a small amount of the people will start to go into bitcoin it will be tremendous. Banks will start to fail, money will stop flowing, all the while bitcoin will go up. How you think people will react to that? It is a snowball effect which will go much faster then what we saw in 2017.
To give you a better understanding, only in NL and BE there is over 750 billion usd on savings accounts. Money that can flow out of the banking system in a heartbeat. Now imagine all the money directly available on bank accounts around the globe. All the cash money around the globe.
And you still think that bitcoin has a hard time keeping its 150 billion mcap up?

Also just buy firstly a small amount of bitcoin to start with and learn more about it (10$ is already plenty!). Buy it on an exchange to see how that works. 
Then just send it to your wallet, Electrum wallet for example. Send it around a bit to get to know bitcoin and how it works,

Don't worry about that, just sell small blocks as you want. (Maybe by more than one exchange to spread a bit).
If someone starts to ask you have proof that it is solid. If they ask why you sell small blocks, it is obvious that you can't sell all at once through this hyper volatile and unsecure bitcoin space (countless of examples in history of why that is a very bad idea to proof your reasoning).
Maybe you need to call your bank instead of Coinbase. They will be the ones who starts to bitch about it.
For tax purpose you could probably use your fiat inflow as a deduction (once), so that you at least don't have to pay unnecessary taxes.

Yes, because it is rare. Think about a Van Gogh painting, when he was drawing it it was worth almost zero. Maybe the paint and the other materials it is painted on. + some day labour wage maybe.
Nowadays people pay multi millions to get suchs paitings as there is only so many. Fiat will always be printed more but bitcoin will stay at 21 million. (While as you indicated is even less due to loss).
Every year your currency becomes worth less because your goverment is printing (stealing) money from the holders. Bitcoin is trying to reverse this very bad system. Because saving shouldn't be punished, it should be rewarded.

"the whole dip thing", bitcoin is still in its early days, so it is hard to find a good price for it. In the last 48 hour it has been a wild ride (both up and down). But look at long charts and put them on log scale.    Then it goes up in general and "dips" sometimes, but that never takes long before it rises again.
Even on a bigger timeline in 2017 it went from $1000 to $19000, but after that it never went back to $1000, it stopped falling at $3000. So evne when people talk about crashing and going to zero and that it is all over. Actually those who bought early in 2017 never saw it fall anymore below a 300% return!

Bitcoin will go after the savings first, there are a thousand of decent ways to pay out there in the wild. That is not really the problem bitcoin tries to solve here.
Also it is a bit like asking in 1998 about how we exactly are going to use the internet in 2008. We don't know yet. Things which were impossible in '98 were pretty normal in '08.

Certainly not. 
Bitcoin is supposed to be mined every ~10 minutes. So what happens is that when the price rises, mining activity risis (or when new mining machines are made), so it becomes easier to find bitcoins (mining process).
Now it means that a block might be find every 8 minutes. This means that the bitcoin difficulty adjusts to be more difficult so that blocks once again will be find every ~10 minutes.
So miners have no influence on this. Nor improvements, only price for what matters to allow more or less miners (so security of bitcoin is tight together iwht the price).

As matter of fact, this uncertainty makes that bitcoin isn't yet at a super high price, so it is very attractive for those who believe in it and have the courage to act.

A government borrows money from someone and gets paid to borrow the money instead of paying for it. So they gain money after closing the bond in 10 years.


Imagine investing in a pension fund who calculates with rates of 4-6-8% and getting an actual negative interest rate for a decade. You start to see what is bad here? If not i help you out a bit, this means that the pension fund actually need to pay the government for providing them money instead of receiving money. So the pension fund ends up with less money after ten year. So they can never earn the money to start paying you out a pension in the future.


ECB letting a free market of debt and interest not being free at all. They buy up everything and manipulate it to shit. Just so they have low interest and don't have to default on their sky high debts.

Why so?


Where you got all this bollocks from? BTW slavery is still very real through debt instead of metal chains those days.


You missed the video where he basically describes bitcoin through his Ecoin vision?


Because most monopolies you describe are not real monopolies in the way you think they are. Read up on Crony capitalism. Lets be honest, most "monopolies" from companies in the last century are now small meaningless companies (if they even still excists at all).
Even in this not so free capitalistic world those monopolies hardly survive very long. I'm not worried about such threats at all. And if a monopoly gets too big/bad we tent to replace them totally with something new (much like internet or bitcoin is doing right now). They just become obsolete.


Why you think i have not put attention in those other people? But the Wealth of Nation is not really up to date to the current world we live in. Sure we can still learn from it, but Miltons views are way more valueable to our current society.

@_date: 2019-06-10 13:23:34


That is not true. This means that any market is always having the correct price for its value. Tell me one market or asset were  such mechanism ever occured in history.


If bitcoin took over a currency (better saying it becomes a currency), it can still change value mechanisms of cousre, only not measured in dollars as those fiat currencies simply stop to exist.
Look back in Europe under the gold standard. While a gold standard is more stable. There is still value creation and not a fix price. When having a gold standard it didn't mean that there is never any value being created or deduced anymore. Even under the gold standard you could buy actually different assets for different prices, so you could back then just create new value by arbitraging the difference.


Of course it doesn't become 100% of the real estate market. But then you value a house for what it is worth (the living cost measured in bitcoin). You don't value a house anymore because it makes you 15% in fiat terms due to inflation and other fucked up schemes.

It is manipulated in the same way too. Only difference is that SEC somethimes slap some fines on regular markets. (But this market also start to get attacked, look at KIK for example).
Another difference is that it is way more obvious in this market. That has to do with the age of this space and the kind of users (or lack of users).

Might be a good idea then. But if it is serious money i think it is best to find some advisor or do some serious research.
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:27:18
Yes true. I understand what you are saying.
But on the other side, the wealthy are having most of their wealth in assets like you said. They just have play around money in fiat. While most of that other 99% can't even afford to buy assets.
But they do have a little surplus (not all, but enough). So that is imo a good potential for bitcoin. As people can more easily buy bitcoin than houses, or even stocks. And another point is that this might not be the biggest inflow in real numbers, i do think that it will be the strongest force. They are the ones giving fiat its current power/strenght, certainly not those rich people you are talking about.

@_date: 2019-06-12 22:03:33
I have the exact same feeling, even when it was down a decent bit i felt okay. Actually it was down many years of my countries inflation. So in fact i lost most than years of zero interest and low inflation. But with bitcoin i felt that it is likely that it just turns and i keep my money.
While with my fiat i just know that the money is gone forever, often not even able to really know how much is lost due to some vague inflation manipulation.
@_date: 2019-06-05 09:08:43


Uhm no. Besides his known bitcoin addresses Satoshi would have had the chance to mine and/or buy bitcoin in ten years and profit anonymously from bitcoin. (Beautiful insn't it?).
It is unlikely that SN every would cash those bitcoins anyway. He never made bitcoin as a vehicle to get rich by himself. If anything, it was something he despised.

Even if the message is bad (negative) they actually provide a possitive influence.
They seed the idea of bitcoin is humans minds. Sure many will not buy it because of a comic or even when they hear it in the news. But it slowly gains trust in human minds of something they heard years ago about it.
Unknowingly many naysayers actually contribute to bitcoin without them even realizing it. It is pretty genius i would argue.

The start of something beautiful.
When bitcoin is 100k it will have even more users of course and it will be much harder yet again to kill.
This means that it is an ever greater (proven) threat against, USD, fiat, banks, central banks, bad politicians. 
And with that will come more equality, more open (free) markets, less war (USA can only afford the endless wars through inflating the USD).
That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.

The policy in itself is not so bad i guess. Let say you have $10.000 in savings, you also rather not lose it and if people lose their savings it will be a much rougher situation.
But if you start to think about why it actually need to be like this, you notice that the whole system is flawed (on purpose of course). But i don't think we could ever fix this without something like bitcoin.
Although in my country some people are started a full reserve bank, they getting further with their plans, but they have been building on this idea since the last crisis and still can't get it done. Another showcase on how sick the system actually has gotten.

I don't know about your terms, but you might want to hold some debts as long as possible.
Just buy other assets instead like stock, keep the bitcoin, RE or whatever.
In some cases student loans are the best debt you can imagine. And if you have enough assets to cover it you don't really have to worry about it anyway.

You clearly don't uderstand although you think you do. Look out for the countless of companies who do accept bitcoin and see how they operate and accept bitcoin.


Correct, the same way i was using computers, internet, online banking before most of the users too. Now they all take if for granted as normal and forgot how long it took to be adopted in the new tech.




Which LN wallets do you use or tried before if i may ask (to better graps what is difficult to use)


There are many countries in the world where it is hard to get financial services. It is too expensive to get them onto the systems we have in the west so we leave them rather out. Many multi millions of people (if you traveled to the many less fortunate countries you would see how many people can use an alternative like bitcoin). 
Bitcoin doesn't even ever have to be money to succeed. Bitcoin needs to keep being the most trust worthy system though. If bitcoin ever can reach a SoV for the world where it is stable and people do thrust it, it is something very very valueable already. IMO we haven't ever seen something like bitcoin before. Gold came close but is heavily manipulated the last 5 decades by the current fiat owners to keep the fiat system going.
If it can only succeed in this it will already be a tremendous technological advancement, enough for bitcoin to succeed. "A hunderd fault increase in improvements" Peter Thiel whould say (not a surprise of course that he too is enthusiast about btc).




I don't really know this case from the Venezualian guy. But indeed bitcoin is helping guys like this. And i agree that he certainly isn't all working out already and perfect for everyone and all usecases. It still is in a very early stage which much of uncertainties how things will role out.
Thats why i root more for a SoV usecase at the moment than as money. In certainly can work and does work in both ways. But the first one is much more important too humanity in general.

You seem to be able to analyse, so i would love to see it.
@_date: 2019-06-28 11:47:23
I dunno, why you actually take the profit? And what you do with the money?
I mean if you would have been in bitcoin for long. You have sold a big chunk of your bitcoin (it doubled so many times by now). But you only end up with loads of cash (while if you would have stayed in, you would have much more). And you only have bigger and bigger amounts of fiat which are doing nothing. (you probably get tempted to invest in something again, or just spend it).
Not to totally disrigard it though, it has probably worked out for you pretty well in this volatile market. But for example i bought some at 3k. Now i would have sold half of that at 6k, i wouldn't be so happy. Nor did i really need the fiat in the meantime.

You need to find your own balance based on your personal circumstances.
It depends on your age, your comfort with bitcoin itself (security, understanding it financially, market volatility, etc). How good you are in the job market, can you always find work even in a deep recession? Do you have bad (high interest) debt? Where you live geographically.
Look for example at stocks, many would say that you need to deversify etc, but if you look at almost all famous investors, they bet very big when they see something they like. Because often investments like bitcoin only appear once.

Not true. You can easily have negative bond rates (see EU). Anyway, effectifly they haven't really paid anything. US living a very comfy life because they inflate their debt away to the rest of the world.

It doesn't matter how much percentage they pay. It is all about real interest earned.

@_date: 2019-06-21 21:56:05


Isn't it genius? It is almost evil.
When there is inflation the threshold for higher tax brackets also get reached earlier (altough they might "adjust") them. The amount they pay out to beneficiaries can hardly keep up. You actually get insentivised to invest and take risk (so higher taxed if successful). So besides working a 9/5 you need another job to learn yourself another job: investing to just keep the wealth you just earned.

Its a self fulfilling prophecy fueled by a government who keeps the supply lower then the demand in the housing market.
More demand is higher house prices &gt; higher rent, which demands more wealth in houses, which raises the demand of houses, which increases rent/house prices.

Safely regards also on your own techical skills, to start use difficult high secure things is probably not a good idea as you may lock yourself out of your bitcoin if you do something wrng.
It also depends on your situation, where you live, what amounts they are, it if is a lot of money for you.
But in general i would argue, small amounts i would trust to exchnages like Coinbase, kraken or Bitstamp.
Small/medium amounts i would put in Electrum, or any other well known pc/mobile wallet.
If you talk about sums of money and wanting to hold for the long run, buy a hardware wallet.
It doesn't make sense imo to buy a hardware wallet for a 100$ bitcoin investment, that means you put a third in the hardware wallet itself..
On those 3 exhcanges the liquidity is good enough for you to never worry about (at least in euro and usd).

@_date: 2019-06-05 10:58:36
Yes, you should know about that.
The problem is that investing is not easy of course and risky. So it is hard and you should do your own research. You could learn more about bitcoin to fully understand it and then it will be much easier to make decisions about if and how much you should invest.
Here are some quick sources:
 - great videos to give you a good understanding of what bitcoin is. Highly recommend it to watch at least some of his conferences.
The book: "The Bitcoin Standard" from author Saifedean Ammous - it will give you a better understanding of what money is!
If you really got into it this far, there is another great source to entertain yourself even longer!: 
You have to make a plan for yourself though, Dollar cost avering (where you put for example 100 euro per month into bitcoin) might be a good plan. Or maybe you want to once buy bitcoin right now as you think it is cheap, but then you need to make sure you don't panic when it goes down maybe. Also you are still young and probably a nice future ahead in Germany. So even going all in might not be so redicilous as some would say.

I'm not so sure anymore this will actually happen (i thought so before).
But bitcoin is not so big of a market. The run to safety will probably outpace the outflow. And if bitcoin goes up in a crisis many will notice this and this can create a huge run on bitcoin.

Look at the questions/responses when they ask about bitcoin.
He definetely isn't even serious, he just get super annoyed by those stupid people who keep asking it to him over and over again.
Its like asking taxi driver what he things about Uber.
An horse cart manufactor what he thinks about cars.
A newspaper owner on his opinion about online news.
You need more?
@_date: 2019-06-05 16:00:38










Because it comes at a huge cost. Here in the west you could live cashless for a very long time already.
But actually cashless has a huge cost and extra risks + loss of privacy. So actually it is something we really really shouldn't want. Not in the current setup at least.

Energy consumption is a low level FUD attack.
Electricity is never been so easy to produce on earth as of today. And it is even likely that when Bitcoin start demand more and more electricty even better ways will be (profitable) invented.
If bitcoin would use very heavy energy like crude oil for gold mining we would have a real issue though.

I would go so far to say that almost no one gets this at all (even economic/finance students, or sometimes bank workers).


'08 was for my an eyeopener to really dive deep into the how and why. And with me many other bitcoiners as well i guess. I think that with current information technology bitcoin will really thrive because more people can/will understand it.
Banks easily survived the tech/internet boom. But i doubt that they will really survive what is comming next. There is still some hope my friend. Keep educating the ones around.

Of course it is. That is the whole point of bitcoin. It is about the stack which is mined, not the coins who still needs to be mined.
How bigger this difference, how bigger the stock to flow ration and how lower the inflation. That's what bitcoin makes it so genius.
@_date: 2019-06-08 09:45:56
Of course, but in this market there isn't much sence. Otherwise the whole coin market would have looked a lot different.
Many speculation, unskilled investments and scams are runned pretty succesfully.
@_date: 2019-06-30 09:27:36


In hindsight you can make billions a month.
For what you say makes more "sense" actually doesn't. If one would believe that bitcoin will reach the gold market cap (350k/coin). The risks you win a $17000 gain (sell at 20k, buy at 3k), is far greater then you miss out on the 330k gainz all the way to where you see it going.
Hence "hodl" if you believe in bitcoin. If some suddenly think they became the worlds best traders overnight, sure trade away!

On coins is actually a really good idea. I remember some years ago this was actually pretty common.

I doubt, the more one bitcoin will be worth the more careful people will be with it.
And yes, i think over the years a lot of bitcoins will dissapear from people who purposly take them to their graves. But as we only need a few bitcoin which we can devide indefinetly it aint a real problem. Those who keep their bitcoin will be rewarded!
@_date: 2019-06-05 12:52:49
The whole idea of bitcoin is that it can't be controlled.
The crypto exchanges easily could be controlled in the same way the SEC controlles the NYSE. That it isn't working in practice is a beautiful showcase that bitcoin actually does work how it should.
@_date: 2019-06-12 07:46:39
Around 0.3% i guess. No depos/withdr fees and no other hidden fees.

Not really that hard. Buy bitcoin and stick to it.
Some clever advertisters just make it hard and "tempting" to think/do otherwise. They all are looking to freeride on bitcoin.
But anyway, it is probably best if he doesn't time lock them really far indeed.

There is always someone willing to sell. But at what price can get a little crazy over time.
@_date: 2019-12-04 18:16:38
One big difference already is that bitcoin is easy to purchase and keep for yourself.
While gold futures actually make sense as it is much easier to purchase gold futures instead of gold bars and ship them to your home, lock them in your basement and somehow verify the gold to be real.
So gold market leans toward paper gold as it is easier. Bitcoin purchasers lean toward buying and storing the real bitcoin as it is perfectly designed to do such things.

Try not paying taxes for one year and see how full your ownership really was.
By paying rent you are actually way more free than by owning a house. I can move to any place, i know the price ahead of time. If they raise the prices too much i just move away (which you can't do as "your" place is stuck in that place). If i really really don't like it any longer i even move countries.. That's what i call freedom and makes me sleep well at night.

I know it is hard to keep up with all the wars USA is involved with. After 9/11 they went to Afghanistan, to find the terrorists who did this.
The 2003 invasion of Iraq was the first stage of the Iraq War. The invasion phase began on 20 March 2003.
This time taking down another building was too messy, they probably figured. So they invented something new, 
the search for "weapons of mass destruction".

Sweet, but gold is not priced because of this, its priced on its monetary function.


1.56249 BTC has the application it will still be 1.56249 BTC in one hundred years. If you don't see the value in that i can't really help you seeing it. Bitcoin will even get a lower inflation rate then gold, so yet again. You just proven your own point.

Of course it will. As it has to get adopted by much more people first. That's the whole beauty of being in bitcoin right now!
If bitcoin moves like gold (without the fiat money), it is very very very boring. As it basically doesn't change at all.
Bitcoin will not get there in the first couple of decades. But it will eventually.
Meanwhile it will perfectly well does what a SoV is described by: "A store of value is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved."

The problem isn't the mortgage, the problem is in the west the house prices hold no actual real value anymore. It is just speculation and the government (also through banks) is helping pump that bubble even higher.
Bitcoin will certainly break this current way of wealth effect as you call it.


Nothing wrong with being rich. As a matter of fact in a true free open market i would applause people who gotten rich as they certainly brought value to the world. The people which we want to overthrow will certainly get hurt by bitcoin. Yes they can buy and keep their richness, but it will attack their business and profits.

Exactly. 
And it is unlikely that back then a mortage based on one person which now based on two persons saleries (man and wife), is going to double prices again. Besides that in many western countries we are about at the max one can lent for a house anyway. So there isn't that much "growth" in house prices to be seen. 
Besides that millenials will start to move away from high priced places and move to lower priced places, so at one point it will start to come down anyway.

No there doesn't indeed.
In depends of the liquidity you want to use though. A coffee payment for exampel will be easier to route than a max channel payment. (See it as everyone around you has 5 dollar in his pocket and can forward your payment, but not everyone has 500 dollar in his pocket).
If you go for a LN wallet and open a channel with a big hub like LN big or Asinq you should not get any routing problems. They are stable and do what they are supposed to do.
Of course you can also just make a channel to your friend only and go by that way (but you get stuck easier in the end).

Bitcoin is not a threat to the stockmarket, those stocks will be there always and gain value even if they are priced into bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a direct thread to:  central banks, banks, governments, BIS, fiat money, gold, inflation, interest rates, current manipulation, etc etc

Wealth distribution is not a problem. Wealth should flow to those who take the most risks and provide the most service. Nothing wrong with that. Only in the current system big groups of wealthy people don't do it in such way, they just game the system. As the current fiat system is easily gamed and many stupid people are the victum of that.
Sure many people will have nothing and need to work for bitcoin. But i bet that those people don't even mind to do so. And even if they need to work for bitcoin (just like they need ot work now forever for their fiat), it still can/will improve their lives.

When people start taking advantage of this swift, bitcoin's price will start to kick in fast. Maybe we will see it in the next cycle, but probably only the one after that.

Ask one of the many people who lost their ownership rights of their house.
A house depreciates in value (a decent amoun actually).
Bitcoin isn't located physically to any location. So you can take it around the world to the government facilitating you the best. Sooner or later the RE you bought will be influenced by: weather/enviroment changes, government changes, ecenomical changes (think detroirt = bad, South Korea was good), a currency itself becoming worse (look in UK for example the former reserve currency who is a real shit show nowadays).
And many more reasons. All reasons you have non or very little influence on and it will get you over time.

He did lie as he clearly was speaking about purchasing power, he used "its value is stable" in the next sentence. But the value isn't stable, the value is going down on a 3-6% fixed rate.
Yes it is good that they tell that they don't ban it (which i think they wouldn't). This shows that they don't see it as a real threat and we have more time to grow without problems.

@_date: 2019-06-06 09:29:59
Yes it is very likely that bitcoin compared to fiat is and will be deflationary.
Basically bitcoin supply is inflationary (4% now but it halves soon). Bitcoin eventually will become ~0% supply inflated.
Fiat has a supply inflation of around 6%. But the government estimates it only is 2% inflation on buying power.
So it doesn't matter at which numbers you look, bitcoin is better then fiat. But they both are based on thrust and how much we value each one (last 10 year bitcoin was winning much trust compared to fiat).

There are some coins with potential and some which might even succeed. 
But in general all coins are shitcoins. Anyway if bitcoin doesn't succeed, not really will. If bitcoin succeeds the gains will be great enough to be very happy/luciky (if you think you need bigger gains, something probably is wrong and you shouldn't invest). If you like speculation/trading, gamble it on bitcoin with leverage.

Electrum might be better (i love the software), but it is also risky as your computer might be infected.

Of course, if bitcoin from now on only can meet inflation rate it is imo a failed project. Sure nice that you can hedge inflation, but we already do have something which does that pretty well. You might have heard of gold before? It is your certain ticket to meet inflation over the next 100 years.
Bitcoin is trying to accomplish something much bigger here. BTW if we "just" meet the inflation rate, we would not really get a new ATH in the next 20 years (to give you a better picture).

Start with buying at least some. Learn how it works, send it around to different wallets. Setup a hardware wallet etc. 
At least start to feel confident about the technology. If you don't know at what price to buy at least buy some bitcoin right away. You can do dollar cost averaging as Mark said. For example $xxxx every day/week/month.
Think about what would you do if bitcoin for examle goes to $4000, are you sad that you then bought some? Would you actually buy then? Many actually don't and rather "wait" for an even lower price, they never get in! Or FOMO in later.
What happens if bitcoin goes to $20.000 at the end of the year, would you feel sad to be left behind? Will you then wait for a $10k bitcoin? (Many would do that, you now can get one for a 30% discount to that).
Think about how much you want to invest (differs for everyone), how much are you willing to lose? How long can you wait? Can you put in 100k and wait 5 years and see it only go lower? Can you see your money go -80%? Can you handle 40%+ daily gains? Bitcoin does all these kind of weird things, if your not prepared to some mental crazyness, it is gona be a "rollarcoaster" ride.
If you can handle a 100% loss, you much more likely will be sad in the future about not going in with enough money imo!
Also learn as much as you can about bitcoin, fiat, banking. You will feel very comfortable if you went down the rabbit hole deep enough!

And how bitcoins price actually gets found by cash settled futures while they are a tiny market compared to spot market?
The problem with gold market is that the price get found by those future markets so indeed it is easy for them to manipulate that market.

The initial money (in Europe) came from something like this:
Gold money &gt; Fraction of gold money &gt; Good as gold money &gt; Depostiting Good as gold money &gt; Initial money to kick start the FRB. FRB rates go lower and more and more debt money came into existance.
Meanwhile the government/CB sometimes do a bit of Seigniorage and creates even more money out of nothing.
The bank does create a new loan out of nothing, but in the end they need to comply with the (absurd low) FRB rate. And they do manipulate/lobby the shit out of this in any possible way.

yes it is possible. You need to figure out how to buy bitcoin in Singapore (cash or by an excahnge). 
Then when you have bitcoin you need to exchange them for US dollars by an American exchange, for example Kraken.
So you have buying/selling fees. Which should cost between 0.1-0.5% and one bitcoin wire Which can cost maybe $0.01.

This means more money can flow back into bitcoin as they don't longer need to hold the extra token "usdt". Extreme bullish on these kind of improvements!

A remote paying system is working at it does the job. If you think there should be something universal, go ahead and make it yourself, if you really believe in it!

The book is definetly a hard read and i also was lost sometimes. So no worries about that. It is not an easy read but certainly there is much which can be learned/understood from it anyway. I think evne when you caputure a small part of what Dalio is trying to say it is a big win.


He didn't write this. He wrote : "really bad debt losses have been when roughly 40 percent of a loan’s value couldn’t be paid back. "
So this means for example that house mortgages were at $100k, while house values are now only at $60k, so the mortgages don't really represent the actual "real" house value at just 60k not the loan valued 100k. Aka 40% of these loans then are not really based on anything. Basically there has been financed too much debt for the actual economic value of what they tried to finance (these kind of things happen with easy regulation and fiat money which gets thrown at everything, see 2008 for example).


So 1 out of every 5 loans is at that shape.


100 *40% *20% = 8% of total debt.


In real life debt is 2x the total income, which means that 16% (2x the bad debt of 8%) of the real income of people is made up by those bad debts.
I do think what he writes down in the bottom of that paragraph is that this is what he has studied and probably he made these kind of estimates from historical analyses and the current situation.
Is it a bit more clear?

Beautiful isn't it, that you have a thought that isn't really yours and not even correct.


No it will not, they say the same about stocks. Look up the price of Berkshire A shares to see the proof that it does'nt matter.


The fees aren't fixed, they move. But it is not likely that we will all spent bitcoin on the main layer, as that is just impossible. Try out some LN app and see how a possible future payment layer could work.
But lets not kid ourselves, both bitcoin and LN are not yet ready for real mainstream adoption. But bitcoin being another payment processor isn't really the interesting and valauble part of bitcoin right now.


Fewer coins in circulation isn't really a problem. It just will mean that the value per coin has to go up. Yes we can keep deviding a bitcoin forever. Just like USA is putting a zero in from of the comma of their USD forever. Only in this way it will benefit the holder, in their way it benefits the money printer (history has some beautiful examples of a zero to much gone wrong).


Good question and this part can definetly use some more attention. It needs to be easier, better understandable and safe to use for more average users.

A bank gives out your money. So at the same time it is debt and credit. Besides that they have around 1-3% of your money available so, you just hope that everyone keeps their money into the system

What i think that halvings actually do is a little of supply shock, which automattically increases the price of bitcoin over a time (not necessarily directly at the halving).
And when the price starts rising it starts to attract new people. People who hurt about bitcoin before but thought it was dead. But then suddenly it is more expensive than ever! Then they start to researchs and dive in. This effect then keeps fueling the bull market until no suckers are to be found (2017 for example, although i think that bull mainly ended because all the money flew to shitcoins).

No it is not. You can easily take control of your bitcoins, in less then a couple of minutes if needed. A big difference with the current banking system.
Yes exchanges are now trusted, maybe its wrong, maybe it is okay. It is for the people to decide that by themselves as it is their own money.
Exchanges will become better over time (due to bad ones getting hammered down). It is not unthinkable that an exchange will start to proof their fully backed bitcoins one day. So if one exchange start to fractional reserve bitcoin it is likely that this technology will improve in that way. There are people who proposed already ideas about this.
It isn't a perfect system right from the beginning, it takes time. Same as gold and money has developed itself over 5000 years. Don't expect from bitcoin which is made by someone anonymous to be a perfect solution in just 10 years.

To be honest i don't really know why exchanges with such big amounts and so big business in general haven't obtained a banking license by themselves. There must be some countries who can't care less about crypto taken over the banking industry and give out such licenses to gain from that.

Bitcoin is way way way more liquid then any other shitcoin. So The faked data you see here is super untrustworthy. As soon as any of those altcoiners want to liquidate their coins they find out quickly that they weren't worth so much and the price falls real quick.
Adjusted for liquidity this metric would look way different.

Here you can see how it works. On this website you can Generate a random mnemonic for example 12 words long.
Now if you can scroll down you will see "Derived Addresses", here you find an address (which you can send bitcoin to or look up in the blockchain on websites like:  . There is a public key and a private key for each address.
But basically when you use Electrum you only need to write down the words on your initial setup. (12 words in Electrum). The wallet software (Electrum) will keep track of all your bitcoin addresses and public/private keys. You don't need to keep the software or hardware either. You can just take a totally different device, install Electrum (be very very sure you have the correct installation). Create a wallet, instead of creating a new wallet you can use the option "i already have a seed", enter your 12 word seed and Electrum opens your wallet with all the bitcoins in it. So those 12 words are super important, don't lose them, don't put them online or on your computer somewhere, write them down and keep a backup at another place.
Before buying a lot of money i advice you to just buy 10$ of bitcoin, send it to electrum, find out how it works. Send it to different addresses. Try to "break it". Better to first understand the software and only lose $10.
You could protect your seed with extra passwords, but i recommend you to first learn the basics. (It is already pretty safe).

Someone who knows that they don't know everything and keep multiple scenarios in place.

Acceptance can't really fail. It is unlikely that humans start to hoard something rare. So it doens't matter at which price, there is always a bottom though. Which makes that bitcoin goes up again and people are drown to it.

I think you should mine at a net loss. Run a node, run multiple nodes, run LN, or support in another way.
Sure you can mine at a loss, but there are still miners enough who do mine at a profit. You don't really "help" the network imo, if you lose money on mining it would be better to just market order and keep or burn bitcoin.

I lived there for 40 years and have traveled over hundred countries. Yes it works very well imo.


If you can't see this already being a reality or you live in a weird country which has few technology yet. Or you just can't envision what's coming next.
Right now you don't see this very much as lets say you live in a very rich well working country. What right now is happening is that those countries create jobs because they take new work all over the world. (Look at the multinationals). So everything looks great. 
But 50 years further frm where we are at now will look very different. In my country most shitty jobs are automated. And yet we need more workers as we dominate more business world wide. (But in a faster phase we start to unemploy people not only in our country but worldwide).
It is very good for out country, our economy but not so good for the millions of workers who have been unemployeed. But who cares about them right? They can always find another shitty meaningless job until that gets automated away.

I live in one of the most advanced economies in the world. So you don't have to explain me this.
But my country is unemploying millions of people at the time by making the labor more complex around the world. Who is employing those people? We aren't we just take the technological benefits we export around the world.
I'm not talking about a few years and advancements here. But about maybe 50 years and an even bigger increase in tech advance.
Think about self driving cars/trucks/trains. Farmering, online shopping, etc. The way we right now can improve the world is great (a lot of work), but the work we replace by tech goes in an ever greater pace (much faster then population growth or age). So in the long term it is very distructive for the labour market. (Yet it is good for socitiety if we can manage it correct)

Before bitcoin will take a meaningfull position we might be hundred years further. I wanne have a peaceful and pleasant live in the meanwhile.
What bitcoin does for me and many of us doesn't mean it will fullfil this promise yet for billions of people. I hope you can see that bitcoin adoption probably will going to take some long time.
And with bitcoin you could indeed enforce a very capitalistic system in which everyone is for themselves and only think about themselves. Yet we will not see this happening in well developed western (socialistic) countries. I think you fail to understand that the majority of those people do like this system and is okay to pay a "high" tax for this.


Why not exactly?
@_date: 2019-09-18 20:45:33
You might wanne read more about how they get the unemployment rate first.

The first row of wiki:
"Hard currency, safe-haven currency or strong currency is any globally traded currency that serves as a reliable and stable store of value. "


No it is not, as i told before it only makes it unworkable for unit of account. But even that is hardly a problem as most pricing is done digital those days.
I think you haven't really traveled much, let say you go buy a hamburger at macdonalds abroad. You really do care if that burger cost you 1 *local currency or 586.495 * local currency is both are valued at $1? I can't care less and my math skills are well enough to calculate the "real" price in my own currency.


Yes, and businesses spent billions in hedges. Look in Europe, you say that Europe worked better when there were 30 local currencies instead of one euro? What do you think will work better when the bitcoin is pretty stable. 8 "Strong" world currencies or 1 bitcoin to measure value in?

Yea that seems nice. I have a similar goal. But to be honest it worries me sometimes. Like right now interest in 0% here, inflation 3% (official at least), wealth tax 1.3%.
So even though a 4% return seems nice, i do know that on a yearly basis this is still not an easy accomplishment. Sure over the long run you can pull it off. But if the market goes down 50% and you still take 40k a year out you burn down the portfolio quickly no?

Not that you should try with those seeds where money is on right now. But you could also download electrum and import your wallet from those same seed words. (Don't type in those words on a computer if you are not planing to move the bitcoin!), just a headup for what is possible.

Get that straight. People are now almost 10 years later still buying bitcoin because of what happened to banks in society 10 years ago.
Good luck with the next crisis were there is now a drain available. While the whole world implodes bitcoin price skyrockets and proves anyone wrong. Good luck for fractional reserve banks with crappy balances to keep the outflow going.
Sure the system in a whole will survive for now. But the financial system will be shaken like it never had before. Most people still have no idea what is coming. People project that after 10 years bitcoin has reached its high. But to be honest this is just the beginning. Its like a proof on concept, next crisis the real bull run will start.

No. A bail in is when a bank is not being able to continue operations anymore and the government will suggest that everyone with credit in the bank will take a hair cut to cover the banks losses.

It is very likely that the first layer will not stay cheap (1sat/byte) forever. As the fee will have to pay for the security of the blockchain. Now most part of the security (miners fee) comes out of the coinbase. But when the coinbase get decreased over time their should be a replacement (tx fee) for keeping bitcoin highly secure.
It would be good though, that means that we need to further develop and adopt LN. It looks very much like that many parties (exchanges) only get incentivized to finally upgrade some bitcoin tech when it hurts their own pocket, otherwise they keep wasting time by enlistening a new shitcoin instead.  There are exchanges who are not yet ready for segwit or bech...

@_date: 2019-05-07 23:26:15
This so much. 
The first time you get in contact with (or just hear about) bitcoin you don't put much thought in it.
When you hear a few year later that it actually went times 10 or even 100x you start to figure this shit out. Only to realize you missed something great but still have to play a bit with it.
I don't see any reason bitcoin in not continuing to absorb wealth like one big on earth black hole.

That is not when it is settled though. Now you compare two different things and are surprised to see other results.


Who do you think pays it in the end? 


Paypal has a very expensive business model though


It is not what bitcoin is about, if you want that, thousands of options are available. Bitcoin is about security and trust, not about cheap transactions everywhere by everyone. (You still can through LN though).


You might not really understand bitcoin and what it tries to accomplish.
@_date: 2019-05-08 08:13:48
Do you think this will really happen and if so when approximately? 
But that also mean that those coins of Satoshi for example will be looted (if he isn't able to move them himself).


This means per bitcoin address right? So if you just use 1 hd wallet but always different addresses you are at least (a bit) more saved against this?

Oh yes. Before they hear about bitcoin  in the mainstream we are well over the last ATH.
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:27:18
Yes true, sorry i had this in mind.
It keeps a solid market at least, you can see it already in events like usdt/bitfined or Binance. The market simple doesn't react on bad news, as there are too many buyers who are seeking to get back in.
And to be honest, it might look totally different then the last time maybe. More people now are interested in bitcoin. Bitcoin is very solid right now. The overal market is pretty high while bitcoin still has huge potential. We might get sooner back to ATH than many anticipate on.
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:46:04
Yes i know. We are still very early. Much of the infrastruce to make it happen still needs to be build.
And many things we barely can imagine will be build too.
Imagine how internet was in 2000 and what we have seen being build in the next 10 years. And now we do have internet technological advancement even goes quicker than when we were building around the internet space.

I don't think we hyperbitcoinice anytime soon. But still first big poins are $100k which imo is very reachable. From that point on we target the gold marketcap ~$350k. If we really do get higher then the goldmcap i think we can see a real move comming.

The risk that the OP isn't buying is way higher then paying a bit too many.
He can maximum lose 100% on his investment by getting in at the wrong price. But if he doesn't get in he can easily miss out a 100x.. 
If you find a potential 100x you really thing buying at 1000 or 1200 matters ? Bitcoin is crazy and volatile enough to do the unthinkable.

Yes you need to, but it is probably better to run a full node. But Electrum is easier to use and its a nice wallet with good functions.
It was/is under attack, but if you just don't do stupid things (like going to fake websites, or clicking phising links that should not be clicked), you would be fine to use Electrum.
Anyway you can try to download the latest version and see for yourself. Just play around with $5 first to understand it fully.

It's not.
Because in america the banks are extreme slow (they don't clear the money, so coinbase is holding on to it).
In Europe sepa tx are cleared in a business day and you can buy and send your bitcoin without a problem.

It is called Dollar cost averaging.
If you have strict rules (always purchase if you can) and keep it up it is a fairly noob proof strategy. Most investment plans for pension work in the same way. Just buy $100 of stocks (which often pension funds do) and after 40 years of doing this the hundred dollar stacked up to a decent stack for pension. Regardless of stock crashes.
But in the end it totally depends on you. You still want to buy 25 dollar when bitcoin reaches 50k? Do you want to sell when bitcoin goes to $3000? If your emotions interact with this strategy it is less likely to work well.

Bitcoin will really start to settle in humans minds in the next financial crisis.
It basically is born on the financial collapse of 2008-9. Now in the next crisis it will have to proof itself and after that it will start to get major traction (something which will blow our minds).

Yes, Tether is a bit misterous though. 
I now even think of that it could be a good sign that the mcap is growing. Since the mcap of tether is growing, which means that more money is put into it to do arbitrage. And arbitrage brings liquidity and makes the bitcoin market stronger.
@_date: 2019-05-14 09:48:46
A 100% is a 100%.
If you have $100 or $100 million.
Sure we all would rather have a 100% on the last one. But 99.99% of the people don't have the first capital to begin with...
FYI the only stupid one here is you. Most of the people are investing in a pension maybe $100 a month on average. So they are all "stupid"? They invest 100 dollar to get a 6% return. They are even more stupid then stupid then!
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:31:37
99 % if WB net worth are in BRKA dipshit. 99%! He is the perfect example of not spreading money. Look at his past investmens in BRK, often it included a vast majority of the net worth of the company. (Much more then any other money manager would every do).
Besides you deversify between different asset classes. So a part should be in bitcoin and the rest in totally different asset classes. 
Buying Samsung and Apple is not deversifying. 
Droping money into alts for "diversifying" is the most stupid thing anyone can do. It is like gold investors who buy iron to diverisfy their metal holdings..

Debt ratios in itself doesn't say much though. It is likely that one country can stand a different ratio thrn another. Japan is the prime example for that.
But indeed Italians are high on life. But it is mainly sponsered by before the euro (Lira) always using debacement to fund their next endeavors. 
But as that is no longer possible, they now hope for a occasioal hand out from strong economies in the EU and a low interest rate because of being a member of the EU.
To be honest, i am not sure this will continue in the next crisis, it is already pretty unstainable in good times.

@_date: 2019-05-10 17:46:56
It is not so easy at all. If the government starts to print money (easy) to buy bitcoin they have two major problems. One it is rare, so as soon as the not so thick filled orderbooks are bought the prices rises extreme quickly (already proven by small investors buying bitcoin). Two, as soon as let say USA starts to do this major other governements will start to do the same (currency wars /mmt as for example in 2008). The second will be even more problamatic from the bitcoin price.

24/7 Open market gives everyone an equal opportunity. Now when the markets are open all the HFT companies get their orders in on the first second while you take the losses when things change over the weekend.
Bitcoin pretty much proofs that markets who are always open preform decently well. No more weird opening/closings markets will better the stock market imo.

@_date: 2019-05-04 13:52:52
No worries, we have all been there. Don't worry it is "pretty" safe (never 100% of course). But much likely more safe at that place than you doing things you don't really understand yet with bitcoin. So firstly research and fully understand it before you start to send bitcoin away or trade if for shitcoins..
It is safer to use wallets (hardware wallets especially, but it is a bit expensive for your 500$ investment and probably not worth it for now). You could download Electrum (be sure to have the correct version). Try to send a couple of dollars worth of bitcoin and just play with it first.
 He has some great videos!
The book "the bitcoin standard" is worth a read if you want to understand bitcoin itself better as a financial asset and money as a function of society in general.

Yes indeed.

A bitcoin iq test.
@_date: 2019-05-05 22:12:23
Depends on how comfortable you are with money on an exchange.
And how much money you have. If you don't put a lot in bitcoin you might leave it on conbase. Or install a wallet like Electrum or some mobile wallet. You will probably be fine.
If you have more money and don't want to risk it, a hardware wallet is an easy choice.

With an Italian behind the euro printers it wouldn't take that long before we hit an ATH.
@_date: 2019-05-13 10:50:16
Yes exactly. Miners (anyone with a computer or dedicated machine) will have to do the calculation and spent electricity (proof of work) to be able to maybe find the block and receive the reward + fees.
This is almost as same as gold mining, see it as mining for digital gold (solving math problems).
This is why bitcoin is valauble and other shitcoins who just invented their coins out of nothing and gave them to themselves are not valuable.
@_date: 2019-05-19 17:09:09
Once again. Bitcoin is not a tech play, but something much bigger. It tries to build a new way to store/send wealth. 
Blockchain will never get the same result when bitcoin fails. Why would i start to trust blockchain 2.0 or 3.0 when it failed already once? It has 1 opportunity to do it well, if it can't it will not work as a system to trust money to. 
Also this space is not for diversification. This is not like a stockmarket

@_date: 2019-05-08 10:38:54
To be honest i even didn't care much about whole 2018. But maybe that was because i was still accumulating, so it was surely a surprise and a bit sadness every time it got down further.
Maybe it has to do with the risk reward. In the stockmarket you can aim for about 8% if you are doing well. So if the stockmarket goes down 2% in a day, you basically lose a quarter of the possible gain. While bitcoin went x20 in just 2017. Which makes it more "rational" or something to take that 20% hits.
In the long run both will do fine imo. But i am really a bit surprised to feel more confident in bitcoin.

Not saying that this wasn't a major fail for Electrum but OP and his father did some things wrong:
-It is a known error, it is going on for months by now

The difference between gold and bitcoin is that it is very easy to store a billion $ of bitcoin in your home (or mind for what it matters).
Who want's to hold 1 billion $ worth of gold at home?
That's why future contracts will work much better on gold than they ever will on bitcoin. Someone who really understand why we bitcoin would never buy bitcoin contracts instead of the real thing. (So demand should stay solid).

Lets look at it in another way.
Can the USD against the EURO go up 20x and -80% in a couple of years? No it is just impossible. It could go one way (but that just means the end of one of those currencies).
When we have a full bitcoin system a 20x and -80% are just out of the possibilty. Yes they happened in the short bitcoin history and would probably happen again a couple of times. But when we all work for bitcoin, buy with bitcoin, have our wealth in bitcoin. Such volatility is unbearable.

I think you don't really understand what is going on here. Right now miners can dump the bitcoin at $7K per bitcoin. This means that the market is absorbing up to $12.6 mil a day by new supply.
If you dump the bitcoin for say at low as $1, the market still has need to flow in that $12.6 mil, meaning an even higher bitcoin price. Not lower how you estimates.
The miners don't dictate the price, they only dictate their mining operation, they have the choice to mine or not to not mine at current conditions, thats about it.

What a bs argument, sure it might be not an investment you like or do, but that does not change the fact that it is an investment or not. There are many things i would never invest money in, but i don't say they are not investments at all. Just something i don't value or appreciate.

@_date: 2019-05-18 13:20:55
Imo the fundamentals are really strong in the last months.. (Especially compared to the past).
What drives the last uprise of 100% is that bitcoin was oversold. There simply weren't any buyers left anymore. What happens then? The price start to rise and with bitcoin when the price start to rise crazy things happen.
When bitcoin suddenly start to rise 20%, everyone who was willing to sell at a certain point suddenly feels that they can charge more for their coin, so the there are still no coins available to buy, the price rises and while the price rices people are getting interested again (who wouldn't with a 20% daily increase), so the demand even gets higher.

If we ever reach $1m per bitcoin we are well on our way to a hyperinflated dollar.
So over time that only goes faster and faster as more people opt out. If the dollar hyperinflates then the whole world needs to start thinking about what to do, as they all rely on the dollar as being a reserve currency.
Look up weimar Germany or Bolivar to see how fast things go. (Actually there was a picture here lately that overlaid bitcoin and weimar, btc is well on its way for now).

Yea sure, an A for your observations.
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:22:54
Not true.
There just will be different levels of desire to "be your own bank".
As you can already see now, some hold bitcoin on an exchange, some hold it on an online wallet, some on an paper wallet, hw wallet, gBTC and many more products will follow. Best ones will survive, bad ones (with maybe a lot of savings) will disappear. 
Yes i am aware that not everyone will hold it in the same way, but that doesn't have to be. We also don't hold gold in the same (most secure) way.
@_date: 2019-05-27 09:33:57
Money itself is just a perception of the human mind. You argue that bitcoin should not gain value and just be money. But that is not how money works.
Bitcoin is a better money than our current fiat money and i would argue also better than commodity money. So most likely it will be the best money since the invention of money.
But money should hold value, but at the moment of writing the total value of bitcoin is just $155 billion dollar. Or about $20 per citizen, not really the perfect money in our current world stage is it?
So as some of us do believe that bitcoin is and will become the best money, its value against the dollar will steeply rise. So at the moment it is not only money, also most likely the best investment you can make as it will reach tremendous returns if it really will become the money as some of us foresee.
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:00:31

Some quick information about some good sources, its best to do your own research.
 - great videos to give you a good understanding of what bitcoin is. Highly recommend it to watch at least some of his conferences.
The book: "The Bitcoin Standard" from author Saifedean Ammous - it will give you a better understanding of what money is!
If you really got into it this far, there is another great source to entertain yourself even longer!: 
Also just buy firstly a small amount of bitcoin to start with and learn more about it (10$ is already plenty!). Buy it on an exchange to see how that works. 
Then just send it to your wallet, Electrum wallet for example. Send it around a bit to get to know bitcoin and how it works, 
learn about how the transaction fees for sending a transaction work:  . Make for example a small donation to wikileaks BTC address: 3DBKfe6sAhVEjzassXwRSrkbCRUBo71Cxh  (Verify the address or create another one:

We have an increasing money (fiat currency) and it has no ties to gold whatsoever. Or to any other commodities for whats matter.

In general they would want to fight against it. But that basically is a lost case.
So it will be interesting for the first to join in and take the leading position. That will be a tremendous leap for that country over the long run.

The only thing he forgets about his acception of bitcoin is that he actually make bitcoins stronger and more useful.
@_date: 2019-05-19 21:03:42
Yes indeed. 
Although there are some counterpoints. Besides USD i don't really know what should be the other currency. EU is only concerned to gather more countries and doesn't care much about its value. China is not really yet ready for it either i suppose. What else is left?
It would be genius as when the USD start to crack (which it basically already does, but other fiat's are doing pretty much the same or even worse). That suddenly bitcoin will be its replacement. According to the ten years of bitcoin history you could argue that we are certainly on the right track.
I don't think that bitcoin is really ready for it. Besides i don't see the USD really going away real soon. But a slow way out would be maybe the best, bitcoin slowly gathering more value and getting techwise stronger. While the USD and other value items keep losing value.
@_date: 2019-05-27 08:53:53

As i pointed out you clearly don't know math. 10% Compounding a month is the best gold mine you could ever find.
What you want to do is let other people gamble on your product and get a fee for it. So why not take out a loan then and do it yourself? Ask your family, a credit card company, the local dr*g seller, whatever. They will all be happy with 1.5% interest a month and you keep the 8.5%.
Somehow it all clearly tells that you don't trust your own program.
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:02:55
Yes true and this time they also have less force to overrule the crisis. Interest is already low, so it will go below zero (Which only worsen the currencies and make bigger use case out of bitcoin).
The QE programs will also be less effective as we basically used it to pump the market back up to those levels to begin with. The debt bubble hasn't really been changes/solved. 
So it will be a big one most likely indeed. Only question left is when, lol.
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:50:37


That bitcoin is still in its very early stages. Such things as being added to excel makes bitcoin more recognized, brand awareness. 
thinks that in 1999 the internet was widely accepted and recognized. Which it clearly wasn't.
Just like bitcoin now is still very clumsy, much like your internet experience. But that will go away in the next 2 decades and it will be ready for the masses.

@_date: 2019-05-24 22:18:35


People hold indeed hard money over bad money, In this case bitcoin is the hardest, which is a good case, not something bad. (Normally it was gold, look at the gold history to understand it better).


Bitcoin is not a low volatility currency yet and no one really claim it to be. If you care about a low volatility currency, invest all your money in USD by any means. Better then that you will not find it.


Sure, that's why you don't see it yet. But i also don't make a contract in USD for this exact reason... 
You talk not about a currency, which you can use any fiat for. But what you are talking about is unit of account. Yes, in that basically bitcoin is not very good compared to USD/EUR. But no one at the money really is looking for such application, for it to be a unit of account which will be low volatile and very liquid we are talking about a market cap of maybe 100x from now. But bitcoin is already a currency online in some markets, it has been working decently for many years by now. Look how turkish lira, ukrianian hrievna, Venezualian Bolivar all do work as a currency but are very volatily and a bad unit of account too.


Bitcoin can be used for way more things than just as a currency, i am not gone write them here. Try google.
@_date: 2019-05-27 09:24:37
Yea they are very powerful until they don't anymore.
I doubt it they can hold their position. Sure some will survive, but most will go bust. (Many already are on the brink of a collapse).
The whole system of how the west is taking advantage of billions of people is outdated, the standard world knowledge and wealth will keep growing tremendously. Those very indebted countries will go bust in this new era.

True, but privacy will be a more important feature of bitcoin later on again too. Coinjoin makes it already pretty easy.
But set up a LN route and your newly receiver LN coins are fresh as water.
But it is easily possible that xmr will keep having an importance indeed.

@_date: 2019-05-30 20:00:42
The main reason why i bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-18 12:53:29
Because it is very hard to calculate the real value. So as their are people who think it is going to be very very expensive (me included), there are also many people out there who think that it is going to zero.
So you see? Two groups of people and the price flucates from 0 to a million. Now the market has to find an equilibrium of those prices.
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:32:37
In the few years that i am looking at the market i don't think i can really compare those tech winners to any alt at all.
Most have gotten tons of money. But few do really anything good with it. How much money do they even have left? What they spent it on? It isn't really investment attractive at all! Amazon has an anual report which shows real numbers and makes everything clear and irronically way more thrustworthy then altcoins.
What was made to make things more fair and open turns out to be almost the exact opposite..

The M2 money increase of the dollar is around 6%, which i think is higher then the current bitcoin supply increase.


I think you take here the bitcoin supply increase + the fees, while for the dollar you don't (actually i guess its very hard to get a number) count for the supply increase + the countless of bankster fees.

I think in the next bullrun bitcoin will reach around $100k (for 1 BTC). But i am not really sure when it hits that high, maybe 2022, maybe not.
It also depends on what bitcoin actually will do in the next financial crisis. I'm not really sure about that yet. (It could go lower as there will be a demand for liquidity, like gold in 2008. Or it might sky rocket as a true flight for safety).
@_date: 2019-05-20 20:45:13

Not sure that banks and governements will already. I think it is mainly smart money still, HNWI, hedge funds, people like George Soros etc.  Maybe some small government who start to be clever and potion themselves well.
I think if a big bank or goverment now starts to buy the price will go bonkers. Basically it is still not so easy to get a big meaningfull chunk of bitcoins. (Surely some new players were stacking coins the last bubble).

Yes, they will try to "solve" it with any kind of progams they can come up with in the moment, which will more likely crash fiat. Or at least fiat will get a huge hit in trust.

@_date: 2019-05-30 08:28:49
Because the total market cap it takes over has a big influence on it.
At the moment bitcoin is as big as Netflix.
At $1m it has 3x the gold marketcap of today.
That relative "smaller" 100x gain which will come next will make a huge difference though.

If you get money into your retirement account (whichever one), you have an x amount of money to invest. If you like bitcoin, which is pretty logical if you know finance and the current state of the world. You want to add bitcoin (1-10% for example).
Now most such retirement plans probably wouldn't allow you to buy something as risky as bitcoin directly. So you search for the next best alternative and that is some financial product who could give you exposure to bitcoin anyway. For example if you can't invest in gold, you can always buy gold mining stock to get exposure to gold.
Some reasons why you want it this way: Tax savings, for someone who can't really save money (a tax account you can't normally cash out easily), a non tech person or a more protected way to store your wealth.

Why it is a limitation? Satoshi never envisioned a Visa or MA throughput on the bitcoin blockchain (first layer). Have you read the whitepaper? 


I'm not. But Satoshi understood that paying coffees with bitcoin is not the goal. If 7 billion people do just 1 tx a day the whole blockchain thing would never work. It is not build for small low value transactions. 
Why should we keep track and store those useless transactions forever in the most secured blockchain in the world?

So if you generate a multi sig with one of those and electrum for example i guess the hw wallet can't even get your bitcoin as they only have half of the private key no?

Read more about the financial world instead of "cryptocurrency".

Not even low liquidity, aslo the way the whole market is still very young.
Looking how Bitmex takes it price point from Coinbase and Bitstamp. If one of those exchanges gets low and there are tons of open contracts, it is very easy to go on a stop hunting trip. Triggering a massive price change with not much money (much less needed then buying/selling all open market orders).
@_date: 2019-05-13 10:39:39
By the next decade? By next year with the next halving bitcoin will outbeat any fiat inflation scheme...
It is more safe, lower inflation (speaking about money creation inflation), the purchasing power of bitcoin likely risis instead of decreases, its faster, its more private, no bailins/outs, no currency wars.


We can't and we wouldn't even try. The best next thing they would try is a total reset and make a new currency based on current hold holdings. IMF coin or so. (Preferrably also call it blockchain).

Party hats are the perfect example. 
Runescape gold and in game gold in general is very inflationary due to making the game easy enough to play (you should easily get wealth to buy and play).
So there is a tremendous amount of gold coins, just like there are tremendous amount of dollars (to play the labor game).
In runescape indeed party hats with the blue one the most rare are scare, so people buy it to hedge against in game inflation.
Now we have bitcoin, who is also scarce and will become our blue party hat. You can see that we do value a blue party hat in game at $5k, it is just pixels, but we value them. Here you can clearly see how the young generation defers from the older generation. Anyone below 40 would agree that the party hat can cost something like that. Anyone above 40 thinks we are crazy to pay that kind of money for some pixels.
Right now that latter group is in power (banks, politics, central banks, stockmarket). As soon as the younger group gets more established and gain power/wealth we will see a tremendous swift of "real life" wealth to digital wealth like bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-22 08:38:42

Coinbase can get hacked, the hot wallets are insurred, so 2% is likely to be seen back.
But they have most coins in cold storage and although they probably take good standards to protect themselves, you never can be certain. They could lose all your coins. (Many exchanges did so in the past). Also CB can use your bitcoin to not promote certain bitcoin developments, as they do hold many bitcoins they use this. For example at the moment they are more busy with enlisting shitcoins on their exchange that helping making bitcoin succeed and develop further, so they not really help you at all.
The best thing to do is buy a hardware wallet. But this has some cost attached, so most likely only recommenended when you have some real money to invest. 
You can try a wallet on pc/phone. For example Electrum.

True, i wouldn't buy a hw wallet if i was you. Sure it is a bit of a risk. But spendig 5-10% of your initial investment is also a big loss in upside gain. And you can always buy one when the value of the stack increases.
But do investigate then about how to store them safely. There certainly are ways to store them as safely. But it depends on technical skills i suppose. 
But don't create a random "cold" wallet at any website. Then better just use Electrum.

B) is incorrect though.
The market is now still valuaing the price of bitcoin in USD. So of course the price bounds widely. But if bitcoin is the only currency arround it doesn't go x20 nor -80+% in a year anymore. That would be impossible.
He says bitcoin will be the only currency left, so expect very very small price changes (calculated against labour wage or products bought).

If he was on board with bitcoin the next question would follow. How you can value bitcoin to justify it to be a value investment? 
He can't so he skips it regardless of how wonderful it is. As he doesn't make risky investments by overpaying for something.

When i take money from an ATM i pay 1.2% in foreign exchange conversion. Sometimes you pay up to 3 euro for the ATM itself (some countries all atm's have this surcharge so good luck escaping that one). And my bank charges 4.5 euro per foreign atm withdrawal.
So getting 100 euro out of an atm can cost you. 8.7 Euro aka 8.7%.
Hardly free is it?

It isn't extreme.
The forex exchange rates are fixed when dealing with foreign currencies. Whereas 1.2% is the lowest surcharge. 
To my surprise even in Tenerife and GC many ATM's actually charge me a surcharge for ATM's even in Euro's while i do have a EU bank...
Not saying that BTM's are good. They imo do charge way too much, but now we have some choice to fiat ATM's, so that's at least a start. (As long as a fiat ATM is cheaper i will use those of course).

Also just buy firstly a small amount of bitcoin to start with and learn more about it (10$ is already plenty!). Buy it on an exchange to see how that works. 
Then just send it to your wallet, Electrum wallet for example. Send it around a bit to get to know bitcoin and how it works, 
learn about how the transaction fees for sending a transaction work:  . Make for example a small donation to wikileaks BTC address: 3DBKfe6sAhVEjzassXwRSrkbCRUBo71Cxh  (Verify the address or create another one:

So you suggest me to wait till tomorrow. Oh wait that is a holiday, till friday. To go to the bank. To open a bank account. To wait for all the verifications and shit. To put in some cash money. $10 + $5 extra because deposttting money cost $5. To wait till monday before the cash is accepted and then send you that money and you receive it by tuesday next week?
Seems much better indeed!

Thats why they love to sell them for bitcoin. As soon as the gift cards are solds they can't care less and hodl their (your) bitcoins.
I remember a case how people got accused of fraud by using gift cards which they "legitly" bought for a 10-15% discount. Actaually you are then also easily being accused of fraud.

If you really studied bitcoin you would know that bitcoin will be itself more tempting then the $3500..

I can vouch for that his kids missed nothing.
The social contact they can have now with other international kids will outperform those of Dutch schools by a thousand fold.

No indeed, the volume is so low that it seems fake.
Oh wait.

It's not really magic. But anyway it matters, i can understand that OP is a bit dissapointed. Even when he found a x10 investment, the best he will do is make $7k.
Not something you really are very happy about. But then again, that is probably because he isn't in the best situation and this $8k is actually a nice help.

Still you don't get it. If you pay in your way, it isn't settled, it is just a promise that most likely visa or mastercard will push the amounth through days or even months after the transaction.


Use LN, don't use LN, i don't care. Have you ever tried to send money over the occean ? It is still hard after banks are doing it for decades. Of course 1 year after it is operating LN isn't directly easy and userfriendly (it really isn't that hard though).


Are you concern trolling? I bet you $100 that i can get a 1sat/byte through in the next 24 hours. 1 sat / byte txs this week costed me multiple times like $0.006!


Where that is written? There are 7 billion people on the planet. Calculate that they do 1 tx a day, you really think that Satoshi didn't run the calculation to see that such tx are impossible on the 1st layer? If all transactions should be cheap and available to everyone every node soon becomes a data center like those from Mastercard and Visa (search their capacity to see that this is unsustainable for a peer 2 peer tx over the blockchain run by thousands of nodes).


True, but to be honest i don't see them using bitcoin on a daily basis anyway. I don't know from where you are. But here in west EU banks have pretty decent apps, a pretty decent currency, transactions are free and done within a business day and often hours (they are rolling out direct tx's right now). Those people don't "need" bitcoin and will not turn over for its p2p payment solution.


That's why i see bitcoin more as a SoV, see it as a savings account. How often people do use those? Once a month? Bitcoin is perfect for fighting inflation. It doens't matter if we are talking about EU/USA inflation or Venezuela inflation, it will beat them all. Bitcoin is way better for a censor resistance money which fights inflation and other things than that it is the best solution for a p2p cheap/fast payment solution. (Don't get me wrong, i also would like to pay my coffee with bitcoin 1st layer, pay 1 cent in fee and wait 20 seconds but it is not really realistic).

It is not wasting money. You will waste money if you put fire on your fiat bill which can be reprinted for $0.05.
By throwing bitcoin into this address you basically value all other bitcoins a little bit higher, as it is extremely unlikely that those bitcoins will ever go out. And if the bitcoins do go out, let Satoshi enjoy the bitcoin as he certainly would deserve some of my satoshis.

Yea, just diversify in other assets. When the biggest upside gains are gone for bitcoin i will do the same. Not even really to generate any income, just a very solid asset spread. But still a big chunk will stay in bitcoin imo, i can't think of anything better even at $100k per coin.

An idea?

I think it is called something Synthetic vs Physical ETFs.
While they can both be called Bitcoin ETF. So it isn't really clear for the ETF buyer if they actually buy the real underlying product or some IOU etc.
It does happen in the gold market for if you wanne do some research.

Actually they might try. They will invent paper bitcoins, in the next decade bitcoin will run up once again. But now also wall street money will flow in. Not in the real bitcoin marketplace, but instead in the paper bitcoins from the bank. Giving the banks tons of money. With that money they can start to force the real bitcoin market in the way they want it to go.

Oh i did! I think i watched all, or at least many.
But i want to recommend some new people some documentaires, but they should be effective right away. You understand? They probably don't have the preserverence to search the whole internet for all the information they need.
Effectively one docu should make their belly tinkle.

Foreign atm's often have a 100-200 euro withdrawal limit, which is annoying af while traveling.

True. 
Or some ATM's even charge a fee themselves.

Trading fiat back and forth gives it value. It brings liquidity, trust, you can buy xx for it and you know it.
By purchasing something from it you don't get rid of it, you use it exactly how the fiat system is intent to work...
@_date: 2019-05-22 10:50:47
No they don't.
But fiat is easy and "save". It is the biggest lie you probably ever got told. But yet billions of people believe in it (and exactly that is what fiat does give value).
And to be honest it will be incredible difficult to fight such believes. It is in the same catogory as trying to convincing religious people that it is impossible that god exist.

Lets be honest, 2 mil is not really that much.
If i see or hear of a person holding some real estate, cars and stock worth 2 mil i don't really think that person is really "wealthy".
