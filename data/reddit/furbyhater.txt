Bullshit. And pic looks photoshopped.

Why do you say BTC-E is a sketchy site? (Genuinely interested)

IMO if we want bitcoin to succeed we have to be prepared for such an event. If the centers of power feel threathened in any way, they will react ruthlessly and with all of their might. And for me, one of the goals of bitcoin is to enable a truly free economy and cut off the governements, because they are colluding for power with the wielders of power and betraying their people.

So what you're saying is that just the probability of being able to manipulate a transaction increases with the amount of the total hashrate you control.
Do you think it would be possible to build a system based on "trusted" addresses or miners, which would have increased weighting compared to unknown nodes? For example, after having participated in X known good transaction, your weight increases by ln(X) percent, and every node implicated in a fraudulent transaction gets demoted to 10% if caught? Maybe not an optimal solution but I couldn't think of anything better...

Thanks for all your input. I hope you're right and it turns out to be a non-problem. But if we're serious about bitcoin, we have to remember to never underestimate our enemies.

I was going to say "bits", but it's already taken, so:

If everybody thought this way, in the end greed would be the fall of bitcoin...

Of course such a mechanism would require a fork in the protocol. But I'm not sure it's the right path to follow, actually I was rather looking for input from people more knowledgeable than me. Do you have any ideas on how to prevent such a scenario except putting cheap and performant ASICs in the hands of a sizeable part of the population?

Very nicely put. Inspiring post!

Maybe "late" isn't the right word, I just meant to say that even though I've heard about bitcoin when it started a few years ago, I haven't really focused on it until lately. TL;DR I'm not in it since the beginning. Of course it's never too late to start using bitcoin!

According to  the total hashrate is around 1e+16 at the moment. 
The Avalon ASIC  has a hashrate of ~7e+10 at a power consumption of ~600W.
So with 1e+6 similiar ASICs they would completely control the network with a power consumption of 6e+8W (600 MW). That's alot but entirely doable, no? And when you hear about the *top secret* underground datacenters built by the US gov. recently, which are rumoured to be bigger than those of google and facebook combined, they probably consume more than 600MW just for analyzing all the data they get from the Y-channels they've installed at the major network operators.

Well that's peanuts for the US governement and people like Soros, isn't it?

It would be nice if you could reveal it soon, then any possible flaws could be pointed out. Security by obscurity isn't long-lasting anyway.
@_date: 2013-05-19 12:29:30
Dare to point out where the flaw lies?
