I don't know if you heard like me but at no point in this video he said "don't buy bitcoin" 
He said it's a speculative asset, which is true, and not a currency which is also true (there is no merchant that accept bitcoin as a currency yet, all of them accept bitcoin as a mean of payment)

In portfolio management if you want to have 50% of asset A and 50% of asset B, you have to sell the highest asset until you reach back down to 50/50
This is how ETFs and other funds are managed

For anyone scratching their head: it's a Yubikey, like this one : 
It served as a 2FA key for the website, without it you wouldn't be able to buy any bitcoin. I waited almost 3 weeks for mine to ship... by that time I didn't really want to buy anymore
