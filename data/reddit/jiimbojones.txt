Who knows about the bots, but the biggest exchange at the time being unable to payout fiat certainly had something to do with it.

While d- is certainly better than f in terms of grades, this is what happens when you deal with scumbags.

"we" decided to pay a bunch of crooks, scumbags, and incompetents millions of dollars to create obsolete miners that could only be run by those 10 people.
In the real world, BFL and the rest would have gone out of business when they weren't able to make miners in time for them to be useful. Instead "we" gave them money in preorders, then took the obsolete machines and used them hoping to get a little bit of money back instead of taking a total loss.
"we" made the decision to put the power in their hands.

It was an obvious scam because there was no business model.
They never explained how they were going to make money, just threw buzzwords at the wall and idiots handed over money, as usual.
Also, Andreas Anataopadopolis "consulted" for them, doing God knows what, giving them legitimacy, and roping some more suckers into the scam.

What good did brewster do?
how is robbing people somehow less bad than physically hurting people?
How did Brewster's ruined reputation from the concert save anyone?

He didn't build a company. He "rented" a store (didn't pay for it), took out ads (not sure how much was paid for), took cash for bitcoins from customers (didn't provide any bitcoins) and then fled the country.
That's not a failed company, that's fraud.

Compare neo and bee to his concert in England.
He is a fraudster. How can something with no business plan "end up" being a scam.
How were they going to make money? What were they going to do? What did they do besides spew out buzzwords and appear to spend (other people's) money?
Delusion or not, it's not a failed business unless it actually DOES something besides rob investors.

The user's funds are not safe, they were moved and may be replaced.
That is a difference and it is not speculation because we can see the coins move on the blockchain.

They are still calling it "unauthorized emails" when it is "unauthorized password changes and withdrawals that bypassed multiple layers of security."
Wake up.

They did come up with a press release that ignored most of the problem, and they haven't acknowledged the important part of the problem (that passwords were actually reset, and that funds were moved bypassing 2fa and confirmation email).
This isn't a bug, this is them allowing someone to access multiple accounts, bypass 2fa, bypass confirmation emails, and get coins out of the site. Their first response ignored half the problem, and can't be accurate (how can all funds be accounted for when coins have been moved from the site). I don't get how you can accept a response like this.
@_date: 2015-10-11 15:07:35
according to the post on bitcointalk, yes.
@_date: 2015-10-11 05:28:59
They aren't acknowledging any of the posts where people say their coins have been transferred out of their account. 
There is a huge difference between unauthorized password reset emails, what they are acknowledging and unauthorized password changes, and accompanying unauthorized withdrawals from accounts with 2FA enabled.
Don't let them refund the stolen amounts and get away with total incompetence. Make them explain themselves and the entire situation.
@_date: 2015-10-11 04:12:58
how can that be possible when the transactions in the confirmation emails are legitimate?
@_date: 2015-10-12 00:26:18
He just clarified, had 2fa on before.
shocked that the people acting like this is about some emails sent out would be dishonest.
@_date: 2015-10-11 21:31:41
we are believing their blog that acts like the issue is emails being sent when we have multiple people stating they had their passwords actually changed and coins actually moved?
@_date: 2015-10-11 17:29:29
you don't have a problem that someone was able to change an account's password and withdraw coins despite having 2fa enabled and email confirmations?
@_date: 2015-10-12 00:29:53
How can the funds be safe?
Purse refunding the amount moved is great, but accounts having coins withdrawn (and passwords changed) without email confirmation or use of the 2fa is a MAJOR problem that isn't fixed just by purse refunding the amounts.
People received a withdrawal notice, didn't respond to it, then got a confirmation email with a legitimate transaction ID that can be seen on the blockchain. How can those funds be safe?

This thread links to their press release that ignores most of the problem.
If this is their response what is more time going to do?
