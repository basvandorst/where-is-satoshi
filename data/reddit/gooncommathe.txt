He's not a politician.  He has yet actually say what he'll do to change things, only "these things are bad (sometimes)".  He is literally just agreeing with whatever comment he replies to.  He's completely non-committal.  Any time someone disagrees with him, he makes a dumb joke without actually answering.
Hell, in an older post he said that he'd solve Texas' water problems by shutting down NSA data centers that use water for cooling.  As in a closed cooling system that doesn't consume water.  The question was purely about water, and he brought the NSA up just to pander to Redditors.

No, serious question.  The only one using fallacies here is you (the fallacy fallacy, to be precise).

He supports whatever Reddit supports.  He doesn't have actual stances on half the issues he talks about, not does he have legitimate action plans of any sort.

I don't know, I'm not even from Texas.  All I'm saying is that voters should expect actual plans and platforms from politicians, not just whatever they want to hear.  In the thread he posted on he was deleting comments when he said something dumb or completely incorrect, rather than owning up to it.  Why can't he be upfront and honest?

So you're telling me that people involved in investigations or court cases are allowed to just talk about them all they want?  And that that's an advisable thing to do from a legal standpoint?
Are you a legal expert in the slightest?

Have you ever taken even a basic economics course?  Or are you just repeating what you saw on Reddit?

Except it in all likelihood is *not* an illegal seizure.  They can seize money under certain circumstances.

This has nothing to do with the NSA, this has to do with standard procedures in ongoing investigation and prosecution that have been in place for decades, if not longer.  Just because you feel like it personally affects you, that doesn't change how these things work.  You, nor is anyone on this sub a special snowflake.

Take an economics course, kiddo.

So it only sounds good if you lie about it?

That's a fact that ignores the reality of the situation made up of every single point between then and now.


Unfortunately for you, your opinions have zero effect on the reality of the situation.

Currency supported only by the dreams of idiots is not a currency.

Not really.


Cash, credit, and debit are all easier to use than Bitcoin, especially because they're actually accepted as payment.


No, anyone can hold sole bitcoins.  Banks are governed by laws that protect your money.


Not really an issue in 2017.


So not hack proof


So in other words it's not worth it.
