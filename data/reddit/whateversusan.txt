Right, but isn't this exactly the risk you take when you participate in what is essentially an unregulated commodities market? I mean, people knew that going in, right?

So basically you're mad because rules apply to you, and you think you're too smart for rules.
I can't imagine why Bitcoin has such a bad reputation.

Someone on Twitter said it was fun to watch Bitcoin invent financial regulation piece by piece, as they discovered what each piece is for.
And it IS fun.

Pretty much. It just seems so... petty.

Ah, now you want government help. I see.

If only there was a currency that was highly regulated, backed by the full faith and credit of stable institutions, and not vulnerable to one single company's hilarious fuck-up.
Oh hey!

This is what the rich always say. But financial regulation isn't in place to protect you. It's in place to protect the rest of us... from you.
Gox's implosion is a symptom of a fatal flaw within libertarianism. Someone is always going to take advantage of you, and people will lose everything they have. Some people can lose 550 BTC and be just fine. Other people will starve and die.
I believe in government. I believe in regulation. They are the hope of the 99%.

Cool idea. We could call it a hospital! BRILLIANT
