I don't think so, it's more or less an epic mess so far.
@_date: 2016-08-18 14:39:13
The Nano and the HW.1 are based on the same hardware - the manufacturer estimates a [30 years data retention]( for that chip which is of course just an estimate.
To store coins on anything containing a piece of electronics for a long period of time, I'd advise to periodically check that it is still working properly, and of course that the USB standard didn't suddenly change or disappear which might just happen over such a long time.
In any case, I'd also advise to keep a strong physical backup (such as a [Cryptosteel]( to hodl for more than a couple years.
@_date: 2016-08-24 22:35:33
you can use a third party wallet such as Electrum
@_date: 2016-08-17 16:13:31
yes, it is and I definitely do support this approach.
@_date: 2016-08-09 05:06:05
Not yet, but we plan to support all wallets supported by the Nano initially, shortly (that includes Mycelium and Greenbits on Android)

yeah well that's a different issue, similar to detecting counterfeit bills (if you assume that the device works as intended in the first place)


how would you do that ? 
@_date: 2016-08-13 09:40:35
Why is it only new money ? Can't it be people who like different investing schemes (for some value of investing), had a nice time with Bitcoin then diversify ? And scams ? Also a mix of everything in the middle ? How do you classify money as new in a pseudonymous environment ? Every company out there want its Bitcoin pilot nowadays, banks are literally fighting to grab developers at hackathons, doesn't it qualify as growth ?
@_date: 2016-08-18 21:48:08
yes that's right
@_date: 2016-08-16 21:17:47
most likely because it's not portable - it makes more sense for a third party to call a Bitcoin wallet that'll talk to a Hardware Wallet with standard URL trigger mechanisms than by using an agent locked to a single vendor.
@_date: 2016-08-20 14:25:30
Yes - basically a mix of finding different communication APIs that do not require the user to install anything and still rely on the browser sandboxing, or move to Electron.

contracts are not included in the default wallet because we have a different approach to deal with contracts, which provides a better validation experience to the users.

@_date: 2016-08-24 12:17:00
it's a better user experience than having to install anything on a computer, in my opinion. We just miss a standard API to communicate with USB devices, but hopefully this will happen soon enough.
@_date: 2016-08-20 07:54:48
noted and thanks for the feedback, but on the other hand, I sure hope we'll get to see less and less Bitcoin addresses as we move towards greater adoption.
@_date: 2016-08-23 11:20:43
BIP 39 is pretty much a de-facto standard for most of HD wallets and hardware wallets, others than Core (issues mentioned above), Electrum (mostly because of the checksum as far as I remember), Airbitz maybe (to be rechecked) for the wallets, and for the Hardware Wallets Digital Bitbox for the hardware wallets (issues mentioned above) and Case (to be rechecked).
Not sure I'm getting the point about BIP44 since the public chain derivation scheme is suggested in BIP32 (see Specification : Wallet structure).

It's about risk mitigation, not "magically solving all security problems"


which is why the point is to make them harder to hack.


the market seems to disagree with that point of view.


It's another piece of the puzzle to make things more secure, but to me it also sounds like a traditional "solving the email spam solution" which presupposes everybody is using the system in the first place - usually that doesn't work as expected.
@_date: 2016-08-21 12:38:59
TIL writing your own clients is easier than handling some third party code to another team and hope they'll manage to work with it. Seriously ?

we plan to add an application to sweep paper wallets at some point, which will involve entering the private key directly on the device
@_date: 2016-08-20 20:09:57
I think it's the standard Google procedure - if a feature isn't used much and takes time to maintain it's removed. It's sad for the crypto community which has good use cases for those apps (mostly, download a trusted web application) but understandable

I don't think most users care about that level of technicality (and all who care will notice that this was yet another attempt to make a mountain out of a molehill) but entertaining the thought that traders might care about that is even more cringeworthy and just about hilarious.
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:11:18
yes, what's needed here is a proof of the policy used to authorize the multisignature transactions, which is harder but not impossible, and can also be helped by a different kind of dedicated hardware.

@_date: 2016-08-08 09:25:05


you can create a set of rules that can be audited and have it enforced by secure hardware - you can even contribute to create open secure hardware, if you wish. [ORWL]( walked that path for example. That's not security by obscurity, just better practices that can be audited.


write a BIP, have it discussed and adopted then. In the meantime private keys will keep working as they did before.
@_date: 2016-08-11 03:49:42
yes that's normal, I believe the new "cooperating websites" permission has been introduced by Chrome 50

@_date: 2016-08-03 04:44:15
Both run the same code
@_date: 2016-08-16 21:31:08


no, it's more complicated than that. First you need to verify that the bootloader is genuine, a malicious bootloader could patch the loaded code on the fly, ignore a wrong signature, and so on. 
to do that, you need to read the flash. 
unfortunately you can't read it directly from the MCU since JTAG is disabled, so you have to load your own code that'll read the flash when it's run (who did that ? raise your hands)
but to do that you need to check that the bootloader is genuine, since you load that code from the bootloader
yes, it's unfortunately circular - that's one of the multiple reasons why Open Source code is not the magic answer to every problem when shipping security hardware.
@_date: 2016-08-18 14:45:38
Not yet, in a couple weeks. It's a minor modification but I'd like to use this opportunity to review a few other unfinished things, such as P2SH support.

I'm not exactly the expert in the inner workings of this device, but from my understanding it could have an attestation key similar to ours linking back the device to the manufacturer, storing it on a chip which is hard to copy and guarantee authenticity of the device way.
It doesn't seem to be working that way for the time being though from a quick look over  and 
@_date: 2016-08-21 04:05:04

Well drama and Kim go hand in hand, so you shouldn't be too surprised.
Also if you need to hardfork the protocol to run your service, you're doing the service wrong, so you won't even have to ask yourself this question - the service will either not exist or will not require to fork the protocol to work.
@_date: 2016-08-18 14:43:14


it is also supported by several third party wallets (such as Electrum, Mycelium for the non multisignature ones) and you can always format a signing request yourself according to the [specification](
@_date: 2016-08-15 05:14:34
well this is typically why we're relying on secure elements which don't let you do that, because duplicating the manufacturer information contained inside it is a hard to scale problem and that worked well for several other industries so far.

with the upcoming update yes.

Not quite - we agreed on that from day 1, but as there's a need for &lt; 1$ devices as much as there's a need for higher end devices or no additional devices at all I don't see a problem in pursuing both options, and many more, including enclaves. Which is precisely what we do.

well, we're a hardware startup delivering several products simultaneously and have to adjust priorities. The Nano S got much more popular than what we initially expected during the pre order phase so we followed what the customers wanted, simple as that. I'm sorry if a few people get disappointed but usually following the market is not a bad business strategy. If you're interested in what the Blue offers, you can already grab the developer edition anyway, so I fail to see any kind of problem here. The comparison with BFL is anything but fair.
@_date: 2016-08-17 16:14:06
Yes, it's almost just that and ignoring the PIN request. I'm just rushing around to finalize the development environments for the different devices before moving on to that, sorry about the delay, but it should be very quickly done once I move to it.

@_date: 2016-08-16 05:57:03

yes please, send an email including your logs. That's the important part as we don't log on our servers for privacy reasons, so all logging is voluntary from our customers. If your account has a problem (because of an odd bug we didn't encounter before, or because you received a lot of dust payments) the information has to come from you, we have no way to detect this automatically (other than when the bug causes all nodes to crash, but that's not a very scalable debugging strategy)

if that means pushing non peer reviewed vendor specific protocols that are specifically designed to prevent competition and only make things a tiny bit easier while perfectly standard schemes work, not really. Inteoperability is paramount for security products.

eh, I'm not the one talking about "shitty hardware wallets" when it's not even the topic of the post - I'm a pretty reasonable guy, but when interacting with me like that, you usually get what you deserve :) 
I believe the idea is interesting, but see 3 major issues with it without digging into it further : 
- It's a protocol change. I think that most people by now noticed that protocol changes are complicated to push quickly (and that's a feature) 
- It can be used as a new opportunity to scam people. What happens when you receive a payment from a vault ? 
- When dealing with an extremely rigid security solution that cannot be bypassed in special occasions, my personal experience is that most businesses will rather disable it completely the first time it slows down things a tiny bit or creates some additional work. That might also be what happened with Bitfinex.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:43:15
yes, GreenAddress is pretty safe : the second factor let you enforce spending limits in a rather unique way, crypto is done properly on mobile platforms (using a native libsecp256k1 based implementation rather than Javascript), and it supports most hardware wallets for additional security.

No, they're not, because the permissionless thing happens at the edge of the network (see Andreas quotes)
If you can make permissionless changes to the network, you have no network - that might be why you have more people designing web services than rewriting ethernet or TCP-IP stacks.

no, for that you can use an Open Source product such as [KeePass](
@_date: 2016-08-15 05:19:13
note that for hardware related products, being Open Source doesn't help you much to prevent people tampering with it in the distribution chain if you're not building the hardware yourself. Bringing fully Open Source security related hardware products in the hands of many people is a very complex problem to solve, both technically and commercially.
@_date: 2016-08-30 08:26:43

a lot of legacy systems work like that (SS7 is typically very similar) - they operate well under the principle that all parties interacting on the network are trusted. When a malicious party gains access all bets are off - this is also why it's usually a bad idea to connect legacy industrial systems to the Internet
@_date: 2016-04-11 12:15:52
Also the non secure bridge based on an STM32L4 has a [JTAG header exposed]( and no restriction set (as the security of the architecture is based on an authentication of the STM32L4 firmware by the Secure Element) - developers can experiment and mess up as much as they want without consequences (*). Who will be the first to port some other Hardware Wallet code on it ? :)
(*) as long as you don't set the security options, but well, duh.

Our (Ledger) approach is to use a chip that's designed to [hold secrets]( - that way you can trace the personalization steps down to the manufacturer, and make sure that neither the package nor the programming was compromised.

Just saying that I checked that our estimations are off and asked the team to have a look (so on Tuesday)
@_date: 2018-09-15 07:14:09
1/ We're working hard to open more parts of the firmware. There'll still be a proprietary blob, that's unfortunately the price to pay to be able to run on a secure platform guaranteeing the code origin and protecting data against physical attacks today. We're also working on designing Open Source secure chips solution
2/ Several researchers have been able to audit the code independently as a blackbox, which is quite common in the security industry, and report bugs using our [responsible disclosure program]( We also run a [CTF]( in which many well known hardware security evaluation labs participated. On our side we're undergoing several independent certifications ([CSPN]( right now, then Common Criteria over the coming years) where the auditor gets to see the whole code
3/ All commercial chips solution are closed source today, so that's not really surprising. Using a Secure Chip allows you to only trust the chip manufacturer and Ledger, unlike other hardware solutions where every part of the manufacturing / handling chain has to be trusted. The chip manufacturer (ST Microelectronics) and the platform ([ST31H320]( are well known and used in the most security critical industries (banking and ID in this case)
4/ You can import a seed independently if that's an issue, or load your own application that'll handle the key storage differently.
Using a software wallet makes it necessary to verify the integrity of the platform it's running underneath every single time you're using it, as general purpose computers are not designed to avoid tampering - so regarding auditing closed source parts, it's significantly the same risk, with much higher validation costs and much less guarantees.
If you're afraid of putting all your trust in a single manufacturer, the best option is to use multiple hardware wallets from different well known manufacturers who have their reputation at stake (so that'd be basically TREZOR and us, so far) in a multisignature setup, as long as it's doable for your favorite crypto asset.

@_date: 2018-09-15 22:42:30
yes, it's definitely not a secure element (no root of trust, no certification testing against physical attacks, no business logic run inside it)
@_date: 2018-09-16 06:24:03
1/ I'd say that more parts will be published over the course of next year, but this is tied to the different parts of the certification process
2/ Researchers have been successfully auditing the closed kernel as a black box and reporting issues, with nothing pointing to an intentional compromise.
3/ Yes, CSPN auditors have access to all the code since they already got an agreement with the chip manufacturer to share it. i believe it should be completed beginning of next year (rough timing)
4/ ST Microelectronics is manufacturing the chip themselves, Ledger is building all the code excluding the part actually booting said code, which is a pretty common architecture for all hardware, secure or not
5/ We trust them quite a lot because we verify what they've implemented. We've been busy setting up a security lab inside the company providing the same skill set than what you'd find in a typical EAL 5+ Common Criteria certification (software reverse engineering, intrusive physical attacks, side channel attacks), hand picking the best experts we knew from each field, and we continuously test how our code behaves on the chip. 
So far we're confident that the chip security measures work as they should. It's of course impossible to say with 100% certainty that there is no backdoor, but we can say with a 100% certainty that it's quite possible to break (as in, extract critical information from) a non secure chip using our methodology. ST also has strong economical incentives not to include backdoors into this kind of chip considering that they're used in all security critical industries.
We'll also be presenting all those methods in conferences and provide Open Source code - this will be quite a nice asset to the security community considering that the professional hardware auditing community isn't very open either, and hopefully help along the design of Open Source secure elements 
6/ It's of course not possible to answer this question but it doesn't matter much. What matters is that we're testing the physical protections that the chip is offering and so far they behave as they should, making interdiction an order of magnitude more complex than for any other solution. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:58:26
you can import your own seed - or redesign a dashboard that mixes the chip entropy with your own entropy if that's what you like.
hardware wallets also don't use random nonces (see RFC 6979)

you can very much do that when pairing it with a smartphone application. The application receives an encrypted version of the transaction details, decrypts it, displays it and sends back an encrypted confirmation code when you validate it. 
To compromise that scheme an attacker would have to compromise both the computer you're using, your smartphone and keep a communication channel open between him and the two devices.

Rather than competing, they can work together (at least on the same concept) - see applications like [OneBit]( and [Plutus]( that'll offer a similar experience (virtual contactless payments accepted everywhere) while transparently converting Bitcoins, thus removing disagreements 2, 3 and possibly 5 in the process.

Hardware wise, it is technically more secure (based on a more recent and widespread smartcard platform). 
Software wise, on the cons side, it only supports the security card validation which is less secure than the paired smartphone validation. On the pros side, the platform supports multiple applications and you can tweak the wallet source if you want.
Also Unplugged is designed to be used on a smartphone - if you plan to use your wallet both on a desktop/laptop and a smartphone supporting USB host, Nano or HW.1 are less expensive options
@_date: 2015-12-05 04:07:24

@_date: 2015-12-25 09:29:29


maybe yes.


yes because we don't want to create a dependency to our applications/services in Electrum for example, GreenAddress doesn't really need it as you can confirm over SMS on a feature phone if you want a similar feature and it doesn't really make sense to use that on a smartphone wallet. 


yes that's the idea


yes, only for the convenience of confirming the transaction with one click though. You could write your own client that works without our servers and either does the same thing with a third party server or for example scans a QR code representing the encrypted transaction details then prompts the user to type back the one time confirmation PIN which would require no server at all


sure, that's the best we managed for an about 10$ product. We'll have a screen in our next generation devices (Blue being the first one). Also you don't have to carry around the security card once paired if you don't plan to use it directly in a smartphone or with a third party client.

Absolutely no decisions are made at workshops, as this would run the risk of being rushed and unfair to the global community unable to attend in person.

Through multisig, and they're probably the less VC funded multisig business around today. If bitcoin gets crippled, either they get less users (or no users at all, depending how crippled it gets), also if bitcoin gets more centralized better funded companies can afford the marketing efforts to drive them their way - so they'd lose in every case. Doesn't sound like a very smart move.

This vulnerability is critical for all wallet applications as it [allows an attacker controlling a Wifi hotspot (or a DNS server) to obtain privileged code execution]( - also, hardware wallet users affected if you start the transaction from the device, since the address could have been changed before you get a chance to read it.

they communicate through a shared memory buffer so that's the only thing that a malware can touch - commands shared over this buffer are simple instructions such as "sign this transaction", then the secure OS has a privileged access to the screen that can be used for user validation and confirmation.

two reasons why a SIM card is a better idea for cold storage : you can use a PIN code to protect from simple physical attacks, and the flash memory durability is always guaranteed to be better on a SIM card - you can also find good flash memory on SD cards but it's really hit &amp; miss

Actually, you skipped one part. The real issue is not escaping the sandbox, that's the escalation. The core problem was that it was possible to load an applet that could escape the sandbox because of weak encryption keys (due to historical old unmaintained SIM card profiles - before SWP SIMs were introduced, the Telecom market security was indeed pretty lax). If you can't load the applet, obviously you can't exploit the VM. That's also why some platforms mandate an off card validation of loaded applets now, to avoid that problem.


why ? [here is at least one](


I've seen way more recalls for personalization errors and bugs than for security problems, to be honest.
@_date: 2015-12-22 00:15:46
In layman's terms : the core algorithm is of course the same (otherwise the signatures wouldn't verify) - optimizations are applied on specific steps of the computation by using different mathematical / geometrical tricks and specific properties of the Bitcoin curve that other generic cryptographic libraries targeting a much larger set of curves cannot use.
You can also read a nicely [more detailed explanation]( from Peter_R 
Also to make sure that those optimizations didn't break anything, the developers seek to write the [strongest set of tests possible]( : [formal proofs]( that can prove (mathematically) that the code is correct. I don't think there's any other Open Source cryptographic library providing that.
In my opinion and in the current state of things, libsecp256k1 provides more [test coverage]( than all Open Source libraries and most commercial ones I've seen.

I think listing it on our official support page and in the Ledger Wallet application itself should qualify as "open"


Doing that once in the lifetime of the product (once per firmware update for the time being, soon to be changed) is not extremely convenient but still acceptable in my opinion - we're currently working on providing a dedicated smaller bootable OS for that, along with a memory stick that can be shipped along with the product.
Of course I'm fully listening to other ideas that would not require 2 computers and would still make the backup usable on third party wallets.

The worst thing than can happen right now is a denial of service attack (an attacker could connect to the card, issue a wrong PIN, and do that until the PIN is locked). Which is a minor hassle, because you can always restore your wallet.


Yes, you can restore on any compatible software or hardware wallet supporting BIP 39.

@_date: 2015-06-09 04:09:11


you're signing from a deterministic path of your Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet account, so it's fine. The point is to use a similar path on different wallets personalized with the same seed. 


That could be added easily on the generic implementation, yes, good point.


https should be the default when supported.

yes, you'll also need to update btchip-python from

well yes, it's definitely not perfect, but that's the best we can have so far. It's still possible to audit the applet after installation and check that it acts as it should (with the usual possible covert channels and  delayed evil behavior issues).
I think that showing developers interest in those technologies is a good way to move towards better implementations in the future - typically, supposing the issue is mandating bytecode verification on all loaded applets, a dedicated Security Domain inspired from CCCM that would let the Application Provider pick a confidential Load Token would do the trick (both parties would run the verifier, the Application Provider would sign the result)

You can also get an HW.1 which is the same thing in a less fancy packaging and half the price.
@_date: 2015-12-22 06:36:00
it very much depends on what's your metric to evaluate good design. When you update a piece of software secured by hashpower I believe not disturbing that hashpower is the most important concern. We can argue forever that this isn't proper design or that a better deployment strategy would be preferred but soft forks work and do what they're supposed to be doing while limiting the possible damages.
@_date: 2015-12-01 11:45:08
the card hold keys, but doesn't reveal them - it checks the transaction data (output amount and address) then signs it using the derived key that stays inside the card, just like any other hardware wallet but over NFC.
in the long run it will also be possible to exchange Bitcoins without the phone, for example to pay a small amount to a dedicated terminal. 
you can also install several third party applications offered by [Fidesmo]( such as a PGP implementation for e-mail encryption or an OATH second factor application, and code your own with [Java Card](

@_date: 2015-06-15 06:26:08
no hate but that's just not a good decision, even if those bugs had not been fixed it would still provide a better protection against malware or bad entropy than paper wallets which provide absolutely none whatsoever.
@_date: 2015-06-22 22:43:09
That's fine. Clef has its merits (making authentication fun and so on), but not everything is meant to be compared to Bitcoin either.
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:41:57
Just saying that the general public usually knows about those backdoors when it's too late. That random generator had been suspicious since it was pushed into the standards groups.
So it's better to plan for the worst in advance, with clear documentation, rigorous testing, deterministic and anti covert channel behaviors that can be enforced or validated by the end user. Just chanting "open source" and "no third parties" is not really going to work when mass produced hardware is involved. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 11:58:37
All of those are implementation dependent. In the worst case scenarios, it's still better than a bad password that people can guess remotely, or more convenient than a second factor code you have to type back.
@_date: 2015-06-14 19:25:55
I don't think Armory supports BIP 32 yet, so there'll be some work to do in the meantime for all hardware wallet manufacturers.

@_date: 2015-06-14 18:27:36
what kind of issues did you get ?
@_date: 2015-06-04 22:55:10


maybe academically, but within the industry it's well known (or at least I hope so) that the security of the old Java Card VMs is pretty bad. The good thing is that a Bitcoin Wallet application needs at least Elliptic Curves support, which are only supported in recent VMs, so that automatically rules the bad VMs out.


getting the operator permission is also a bigger (commercial) problem. Deployment on a SIM proxy (à la [BitSIM]( is definitely more realistic than deployment on a SIM card itself.
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:51:32
No, from what I've seen, it's BitID with the derivation path of TREZOR Connect - 
So it'd look like it works, until you switch implementations and everything associated to your account mysteriously disappears even if you have the same seed.
I've nothing against adopting this derivation path, I'd just have appreciated to get a previous notice to avoid rushing things, as it has multiple under the hood consequences for Ledger.
In the meantime, people rejoice, yay, we got an almost compatible standard for easy authentication with Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2015-06-10 18:27:01

I definitely support more decentralization, but I support smooth transitions even more. Decentralization is an important but orthogonal issue here. To summarize my opinion regarding updates, using a somewhat common description (a soft fork is an update that doesn't boot existing nodes off the main chain) :
agreed and planned hard fork &gt; agreed and planned soft fork &gt; soft fork &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hard fork
 
you can also place "doing nothing" here in between depending on your beliefs / analysis.

Also the wallet is running in a mini operating system that runs alongside the phone regular operating system and is isolated by hardware.

As deployments move forward, FIDO support should be integrated directly into the browsers (as it is with Chrome today for U2F) or the operating system. When this is done, you'll just have to connect / trigger your FIDO enabled device to authenticate securely to the service.

About the same firmware than TREZOR, with a larger screen, more polished design that comes with a higher price. So why not, it really depends on how much you plan to spend or who you plan to give it to basically.

no, just TEE support. It allows authorized third parties to run their own code into the secure OS.
@_date: 2015-06-22 22:35:58
well that doesn't make it decentralized, that just make it based on public key cryptography. It's still centralized unless people can deploy their own Clef server on their computer (which is definitely doable for standard OATH authentication, SQLR, FIDO U2F/UAF, BitID, BitAuth, TREZOR Connect or whatnot ...)
@_date: 2015-06-28 07:46:41


That's a very interesting statement from Steve, it'd be even better if it could be backed up with some source. I've been following FIDO meetings for about 1 year and I never saw SQRL pop up or even a need for that identity management scheme being mentioned. 
Also I get a bit anxious when I read stuff like that 


As calling something "absolutely secure" is at best a trolling attempt.


ok, so basically you have to print a new identity unlock key per website (which could be compromised by malware when generated) and keep it off device. Sounds a bit complicated to manage properly. 


yes, you get to design how the key is generated. That's my previous comment specifically for Yubico key generation scheme. Everybody can pick their own. 


to be honest, that one on FIDO just reads like some random ramblings. Plus same comment as before.
@_date: 2015-06-15 21:35:42
I'll pass it around, and we'll keep trying :)
@_date: 2015-06-04 14:01:06
Do you know which SIM cards were targeted by those attacks ? The low end versions, which do not have any kind of certification (and usually a Java Card VM which dates back to early 2000)
This apparently didn't generate a massive recall of banking cards and passports either.
@_date: 2015-06-27 08:15:10
Oh well, that's a 2013 post. FIDO has changed significantly since that. 


Software implementation will be officially supported in the next standard. There have already been implementations working on a phone using a Trusted Execution Environment ([actually the first deployment](


There's absolutely nothing in the standards preventing you from hashing the URL to generate your key, similar to SQRL. [Actually Yubico is even doing that]( So in the end you get more options with FIDO.


I'm not sure of what that means or how SQRL handles it.


Uh, no. Over what ? U2F is pretty simple, UAF offers more options. 


That's U2F (which you can already use like SQRL). UAF supports more options and allows to verify the user identity on the device by different means.


What's the problem with that ? 


What's the problem with that ? Hardware is better than software to hold private keys. 


Like, the territory of browsers and hardware tokens ? Not sure I'm getting it. 


Or just wait for the [specifications to be published and read them](


Same thing for FIDO.


There'll be free software implementation. In the meantime, using hardware makes sense security wise. 


U2F is lightweight.


So is U2F.

yes one key point of FIDO is privacy - the device knows how to authenticate you and remote sites know how to authenticate the devices, without identifying you. The association between the device identity and your identity(ies) is done per service and out of FIDO scope
@_date: 2015-06-10 22:09:14


that's the idea yes.


yes, there'll be many vendors


U2F promotes independent hardware solutions - UAF is a bit more lax, but in the end whatever the implementation is it'll still need to be able to perform the cryptographic challenge defined in the protocol and follow its rules. 


The service if they need to and if you register.

[Onebit]( does the same without the token sale part apparently. Also the concept is fairly easy to replicate - Visa or Mastercard do most of the work (issuing the virtual card and offering the reloading service) so there will probably be plenty to choose from.

It is supported by [Mycelium]( [Ledger]( [DarkWallet]( and [TREZOR]( (if using TREZOR Connect with no visual challenge or through a third party wallet supporting the BitID URI such as Mycelium)
One issue today is that different providers use different key derivation paths which breaks accounts when switching implementations - once everybody aligns on the derivation path described in [SLIP-0013]( things will be better.

unfortunately the memory size on the Nano is too small to handle both (well technically we could but on a different ROM mask so people would have to buy a new anyway) - the plan is to support the NFC and BLE transports of both U2F and UAF for our next wallets.

Speaking with my interoperability hat on, just be aware that if you lose your TREZOR and use any ["Sign-in with TREZOR" application]( or anything specific to TREZOR Connect right now you'll have to buy another TREZOR or stay locked out of your account. It's a similar issue to the one discussed last week re. [TREZOR Connect vs BIP 21]( for a standard transaction signature.
This is why I'm strongly advising users and integrators to stick to interoperable standards. At worst, things should work transparently with different hardware vendors. At best, things should work transparently with different hardware vendors and different software applications.
@_date: 2015-06-21 12:37:50

you can hardly disagree that existing nodes aren't booted off the network in a soft fork - you can say that it makes individual nodes temporarily less useful for sure (until they upgrade), but in the end if you have to choose between doing that or doing nothing a soft fork sure beats watching the castle burn in my opinion.

Re 3., the first issue is that such solution doesn't exist. The second one is that it makes backuping it more fragile (now you have 2 keys to backup instead of one). The third one is that multisignature makes things more complicated security wise (it's harder to check than the change is not sent to a rogue address, for example, compared to a simple HD Wallet) - that part is mitigated when signing with an external party, but doing it between you and yourself doesn't really helps.
@_date: 2015-12-01 06:59:50

@_date: 2014-09-09 16:07:52
yes, definitely registered so we can fill a claim in case of problems. Shipping immediately as in tomorrow morning EU time :)
@_date: 2014-11-20 23:03:37
It's less convenient because if you want to use it in the most secure way you have to use one computer and another device (computer/phone)
Also unplugging/replugging the card was declared too annoying for many testers.
@_date: 2014-09-15 05:43:09
1/ We're using the standard BIP 32
2/ Yes, **after** you generated the seed, if you decide to dump the seed on the same computer
3/ will be a bit longer sorry :)
It always protect you from getting your keys stolen. 
It makes it harder to get a malware tinkering with the transaction if you're using the second factor validation on the same computer, but it would still be doable to bypass it (with a malware that's way more complex than a regular web trojan and fully owns the computer) ; it also protects you against that kind of malware if you use the second factor on a different computer / device - the second factor ("dongle turning into a keyboard") can be used on any device that supports HID keyboards, so you have a lot of options
Being a smartcard, it also protects you more against physical reverse engineering attacks than a regular micro controller - so you can lose it, and still have plenty of time to transfer your funds using a backup (this is also why you should **always** use Trezor with a passphrase, IMHO)
4/ another good one 
it'll require some effort on your part, as the product is not open source (and that one will never be due to too many NDAs and restrictions - even the compiler is not open)
first you can check the specification and verify that all parts are deterministic, not considering the seed generation (so if you don't trust the device, just don't let it generate the seed), supposing the device follows the specification strictly. You can also do that by verifying with another device (such as a Trezor) that signing the same thing gives you the same result (with a little twist for change outputs, as we randomly change the output index, but compute both and you'll find the same thing)
then you can check that the wallet/client strictly follows the specification and does not use hidden APDUs or undocumented parameters
after that review you should be more confident - and consider that the device is safe while it's in your hands. We could still have a magic command that dumps everything, so don't lose it (that one is on us - to prove it, we'd have to go through an independent professional audit review of the code, which is perfectly doable - also, of course we don't have such a command, it'd be pretty stupid for a non shady company to do that :p)
5/ as many as you like, being BIP 32
6/ that one will get documented and we'll link to it in a clear way on the website when it's done. I'm waiting for more videos ...
@_date: 2014-11-20 22:51:13
Sorry, [this is the old second factor]( - a booklet could be a solution, but it's a pain to carry around.
@_date: 2014-11-21 07:29:31
yes, but our test panel still found that more annoying than the security card we have now.
@_date: 2014-11-20 19:01:20
Purchase both, this is really Gentleman :)
@_date: 2014-12-18 09:31:28
Some additional notes 
Instead of deleting the wallet and recreating it, just removing / reinserting it should have worked. That bug related to a network connection error is getting fixed.
The generated account is compatible with BIP 44 (on account 0), the seed is compatible with BIP 39 - so you can restore it on anything supporting those (typically if you also have a Trezor, you can interoperate both ways)
@_date: 2014-11-20 21:49:51
At least we have [a specification]( that you can read to make an educated choice :)
TLDR : yes, it's better to have a screen. yes, we'll have a screen on next generation products. In the meantime, we offer interesting tradeoffs.
@_date: 2014-11-20 21:58:28
I've a personal policy not to criticize successful guys so I won't comment on that
@_date: 2014-11-20 20:29:52
I believe weird things can happen if you use the current wallet with a firmware not personalized to use the new second factor during a few days. Then things will get back to normal.
Also, the PIN is absolutely not protected on purpose, it's an anti theft measure, not an anti malware measure.
@_date: 2014-09-15 11:03:59
Several things :
- Java Card doesn't let you generate a public key for an arbitrary private key (there is no implementation of the 'trapdoor function')
- Most Java Cards do not support SHA 512 - but that can be implemented manually, as I did with [RIPEMD160]( which is not implemented either (I'm not responsible if you start bleeding out from your eyes after clicking that link :p)
- Many Java Cards do not support ECDSA signatures with SHA 256 (it was introduced in some sub-revision of classic 3 very quietly)
So you'll have to recheck a few things before knowing if you can reuse your cards for Bitcoin related things - checking with the Open Source version can be a good option.
Also I made some kind of testing applet designed to check the capabilities of a Java Card platform re. Bitcoin applications, I should publish that as well.
@_date: 2014-12-08 18:50:00
It gives you more options, and also more things to watch for. I wouldn't compare a multisignature using both your online phone and your online computer, or two distinct online computers, and a multisignature using two seeds you'll type on the same computer. Which is what you might be doing if you don't pay attention.
@_date: 2014-12-10 10:30:45
Regarding the first attack : the firmware disables JTAG. Which means that it's not trivially possible to just plug a probe and dump the memory contents. Now the problem is to assess exactly how trivial is trivial - hardware hacking is still associated to black magic and many people have misconceptions about how secure (or not secure) their hardware really is.  There's definitely a lack of public ressources regarding STM32 glitching and various power analysis attacks that needs to be addressed. You're of course free to dismiss this as "marketing bullshit" and keep thinking that STMicroelectronics operates distinct business units for regular microcontrollers and secure microcontrollers only because they enjoy scamming people :)
Regarding the second attack : [I reported a buffer overflow vulnerability to Satoshilabs in firmware 1.2.0]( - if you downgrade to this firmware, you can run arbitrary code. You won't be able to steal a previously installed key as it's erased when you reflash, but if someone provisions it again then you can grab it. This is why all external clients should check that Trezor is [at least running firmware 1.2.1]( (or better, if they're online, synchronize with MyTrezor.com to fetch the latest version). Assuming that no magic malware running on your computer is changing the firmware version reported by the device, otherwise you're lost in the woods :)
@_date: 2014-10-24 21:12:53
You can load your own custom firmware that dumps the bootloader memory region to do that
@_date: 2014-10-13 09:28:50
same as for the reverse engineering - do your own due diligence, I'm giving you pointers, then it's up to you to push forward or not.
@_date: 2014-11-30 13:27:50
no black or white answer ... it's obviously bad to fragment the market, but some people might want subtle deviations that suit them better. Real life example : how to confirm on device a transaction that sends change back to a P2SH address.
@_date: 2014-09-18 16:17:17
Yes, you can generate the seed offline and import it - then you don't need to trust the chip RNG at all.
Also thanks :)
@_date: 2014-11-21 07:30:09
each one is paired to a unique security card at factory. we might change that later and let you pair the security card yourself though.
@_date: 2014-11-20 19:11:48
not that sure about guy - otherwise, it's a tradeoff. 
The PIN can be spied by a malware, but a malware is not going to be able to spend anything without knowing the second factor. The second factor is 4 random characters of your payment output address requested by the chip, confirmed using a printed card.
@_date: 2014-09-15 10:14:43
we're doing 55 kHash/s on the upcoming firmware update so ... no :)
@_date: 2014-09-18 16:14:32
yes, that's the point, security is unfortunately not black or white. 
It'll be hard to get PRISMicide (now Bitcoin Pinpad) target smartcard + reader below &lt; 10$, even with high volumes.
@_date: 2014-09-10 05:47:11
That should happen quickly if you're based in Europe :)
@_date: 2014-11-20 23:25:21
Always the best place to be concerned
@_date: 2014-11-20 19:23:49
ok, again on the sequence.
You want to pay to 1paymenowplease....
You send your UTXOs, the destination address (1paymenowplease...) and amount to the chip
The chip generates 4 **random** indexes to match, here in bold, 1pa**y**me**n**owp**l**ea**s**e...
You match this against the second factor card
A malware cannot change the payment address in advance, because it doesn't know which indexes the chip will draw.
And changing the address after the indexes are drawn is useless, because the chip will keep using the address that has been initially submitted for this transaction.
@_date: 2014-11-12 07:01:24
We have an [open source version of an older BTChip firmware]( running on Java Card, if that helps
@_date: 2014-09-09 18:19:15
yes, you can use non registered mail then (the first 20€ option), but no one can fill any claim if the package is lost. Registered mail may, depending on your country, require you to sign (usually not because we don't ship with this option, but you never know)
@_date: 2014-10-25 16:04:44
Try to remove your maven cache (rm -rf ~/.m2 on linux/mac) - solved the problem for me, if you don't mind re-downloading internet.
@_date: 2014-10-22 20:26:24
No, people really need to stop linking at the BadUSB PR whoring campaign. 
It's just a case of "insecure devices with firmware flashing capabilities are insecure" which is utterly obvious.
Moreover the [same thing]( was already done in 2009, in a more scary version. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 00:13:39
You can also check it using our second factor confirmation. See [our specification]( (yes, I'm going to spam every comment about a lack of display with that :p)
@_date: 2014-09-18 15:58:19
Open your mind and [read the specification]( :)
@_date: 2014-11-20 21:05:31
I'll report that, thanks for the feedback.
@_date: 2014-11-21 13:04:37
yes, we plan to add BIP 70 in the future. Also make it easier for people to use BIP 70 for their own addresses. That's the best protection against this type of attack.
@_date: 2014-11-20 21:18:14
oh ok, sure. thanks for clarifying that. So each cosigner has to be HD Wallet based.
@_date: 2014-10-17 06:04:38
Feel free to post a re-interpreted part of what you understood from the bootloader as a proof like I did :)
@_date: 2014-11-21 14:02:15
It doesn't support querying the security card seed.
@_date: 2014-09-15 05:49:47
Yes, it's very trustworthy, you can trust me :) 
Being more serious, make your own opinion from the [Specification]( (you should find that technical enough :p) and independant users reviews
@_date: 2014-09-18 16:21:37
Also, I'm providing the specification so **you** can check that it's implemented honestly and consistently.
All certification programs work that way, cross industries.
Welcome to [Common Criteria]( enjoy your stay.
@_date: 2014-11-19 10:58:16
Fees should be the usual ones up to 3 of 3 ... this is actually why the competition is not doing more than 3 of 3 IMHO.
I'll look into supporting signing from our HW.1 dongle over the next couple days.
@_date: 2014-12-15 18:04:45
Which is why we try to find the right balance between security and ease of use for the second factor - this is the tricky part in getting this specific product right.
@_date: 2014-09-15 07:34:38
Don't worry, I'm not offended at all, as part of the international conspiracy of people with weird accents designing hardware wallets. Thanks for your order :)
@_date: 2014-09-15 05:48:06
no, [GPG]( - so regular "public key encryption".
@_date: 2014-09-15 06:56:45
Thanks for your comments ! Yes, english is obviously not our native language :) so every suggestion is welcome. 
Regarding trust, please check [this earlier comment]( that should give you additional input - being open source is not a magic bullet either, especially when nobody reads it :)
@_date: 2014-11-20 21:51:36
The 4 indices will be displayed on the host computer. You have to read them on the (supposedly) correct address, match them on the security card, and enter the matched character on the host computer.
@_date: 2014-09-15 00:11:19
Thanks. You'll also like that all your personal data was GPG encrypted on your side before being sent to the server, so we don't store any email or personal details in cleartext :)
@_date: 2014-12-10 09:07:18
I'd say they serve different purposes - GreenAddress is more user oriented (providing an easy to use multisignature wallet, instant confirmation and an API around it), Coinkite is more business oriented (providing an API and a wallet around it).
Also, GreenAddress offers mobile applications on Android and iOS.
@_date: 2014-11-20 21:56:12
That you get the full specification of the card and can write independent tests to check that both the card always reply to the commands in the expected way, and that the clients only use documented commands.
@_date: 2014-11-20 21:52:23
thanks for the very cool comment !
@_date: 2014-10-19 05:54:37
Trusted Execution Environments are not really a silver bullet - both for technical reasons (implementations typically fail to consider enough security issues) and commercial reasons ([the technology to implement bitcoin applications in a SIM card]( has been there for many years - but you can't use it because owners won't let you)
@_date: 2014-10-17 06:17:15
Also FWIW and trust building, I reported an exploitable buffer overflow in the previous firmware under [their responsible disclosure program](
@_date: 2014-09-15 05:55:53
depends how confident you are and what kind of malware you suspect ... f.e. supposing you get an operating system with a "super unhackable login screen" (c), just reading the second factor in that login screen would do. Security is a balance (that should be my new official motto :p)
@_date: 2014-12-13 11:49:35
You can be creative when you have a privilegied execution environment (Secure World) and GPIOs
@_date: 2014-10-24 21:11:36
The checksum of the bootloader is returned on handling the "Features" message 
@_date: 2014-09-09 19:45:18
Thanks, that's why we all love bitcoin :) Orders placed usually ship next day during week days.
@_date: 2014-09-09 19:57:32
No, that's ok. We don't ship broken parts either.
@_date: 2014-09-18 16:32:30
Oh interesting. How do you check that with open source code without open hardware then ? 
Some branches could also only be executed 99.9999% of time :(
Also there are only a limited number of parameters you can play with in a bitcoin transaction and that could be set by an attacker and prove useful - so which scenarios do you have in mind ?
@_date: 2014-10-22 08:49:26
One implementation might remind you of something you've already seen in Bitcoin space :) 
@_date: 2014-11-20 20:58:08
that and you can like several different approaches to the problem. Keep it Gentleman :)
@_date: 2014-09-15 12:41:38
why ? the specification states what it's typing.
@_date: 2014-10-19 09:40:46
@_date: 2014-09-09 23:57:00
everyone is free to try his luck, we're patiently waiting for 6 confirmations before shipping in any case :)
@_date: 2014-09-09 20:20:35
it saves money on the manufacturing (you can reuse a lot of existing tools in a generic boring smartcard production line) and it looks cute
@_date: 2014-09-18 15:10:28
plastic card != chip card
@_date: 2014-11-30 08:17:32
You can check what you're signing with HW-1 by using the [default second factor](
@_date: 2014-10-19 16:43:54
Yes, that's quite fine. I'm well aware of what is offered since Trusted Logic sold the key technology to ARM 10 years ago and the amazing integration work that has been accomplished ever since :)
Just don't forget to make your own test cases and security evaluations before depending on the wrong unicorn for your products, as a friendly advice.
@_date: 2014-09-18 20:23:28
I'll answer that when you'll show me your port of boost for the ST7 architecture.
@_date: 2014-09-18 17:38:39
You should find most programming interfaces (C, Python, JS, upcoming Java) on [our github] (
Also you can read the source of [GreenAddress Chrome Client] ( [GreenAddress Android Client] ( and [Electrum] ( for integration samples
@_date: 2014-11-20 19:00:30
It's not, it's a tradeoff. When you submit a transaction to the chip, the chip will pick 4 random characters of the payment output address you submitted and ask you to confirm them using the second factor card. It's a more convenient version of our old keyboard based second factor.
You're correct about the second part as the change is a BIP 32 path, resolved internally to an address.
@_date: 2014-12-08 18:37:35
Also keep in mind that multisignature is not the ultimate answer and keep your signing entities isolated. 
Typically with GreenAddress, if your second factor is an email account that can be accessed on your computer, you failed. 
@_date: 2014-12-31 09:45:33
We plan to provide something in this area soon, of course with GreenAddress being integrated quickly :p - even without a specific indicator or a properly enforced implementation of the [Trusted UI API]( it's still possible to be a bit creative for a second factor validation. 
Regarding the security of such solutions, several things should be evaluated, from the lowest layers to the highest layers :
- Is the isolation between the Normal World and the Secure World done properly at the hardware level (TrustZone core implementation) ? It's complicated to get right, and a multi-core system with external peripherals is harder to secure than an integrated dedicated solution.
- Is the Normal World and the Secure World information propagated properly to external peripherals (TrustZone third party implementations) ? It's even more complicated to get right, as it involves multiple third parties, and is typically critical for the display.
- Is the isolation between the Normal World applications and the Secure World applications done properly at the software level (TEE implementation) ? A bug in the privileged part of the driver can easily leak information from the Secure World into the Normal World. 
- Are the cryptographic APIs offered by the higher layer implementation (typically the TEE) well protected against side channel attacks (timing &amp; power consumption) ? It's nice to secure keys against malware, but even nicer if it doesn't fall apart too quickly when an attacker gets physical access to the device.
- Is the Secure World application implemented properly ? A bug in the Secure World application can leak data, usual care should be applied when designing it, typically a proper validation of user inputs should be performed.
@_date: 2014-09-09 17:30:48
yes, that's correct when the second factor is activated - so you can plug it into any device supporting HID keyboards (without driver) to read the second factor (the same computer if you're confident enough, a different computer if you're not, a smart TV if you're really not ...) 
When consuming P2SH transactions you can setup the dongle to skip the second factor validation (which is what GreenAddress does) for a smoother user experience
@_date: 2014-11-20 22:38:11
yes. then there are several options :
* You can move back to the old less convenient second factor, which types a summary of the transaction as a keyboard, along with a unique PIN (and is as secure as you want it to be)
* We find a better second factor that is still convenient
* We have a new device available with a screen - existing users are happy to upgrade with a discount.
@_date: 2014-12-10 13:23:16
The point is getting the seed without knowing it, of course.
If you get **both** a device with an old vulnerable firmware and a malware exploiting said vulnerability you're not safe.
Which is why forcing sanity checks on all third party clients is useful IMHO.
@_date: 2014-12-01 23:09:31
1/ you don't really care as the second factor will block it. The PIN is mainly intended against theft, not malware. 
2/ setup is indeed vulnerable to screen capture the way it's done now, which is why you should do it on a secure computer. It was considered an acceptable compromise given that the seed is never vulnerable after that. Also it could be improved with new second factor methods.
As for the why, we think this is an interesting design for affordable hardware wallets in large volumes.
@_date: 2014-11-30 11:00:46
Thanks for the kind words, I don't want to derail this post too much, but regarding the business use cases I believe that every service should be able to get more hardware security when touching private keys or authenticating users, from partly centralized to fully decentralized businesses, so an extremely low cost device you can almost give away to your users (or sell for a couple dollars) and brand to your service (regarding both its look and custom features) makes sense for that.
@_date: 2014-09-18 15:50:36
That's good, so you have a nice oracle to verify what our chip is doing :)
@_date: 2014-09-15 05:52:32
Thanks for being an early supporter and supporting us once again :) Unfortunately I don't have a reflashing scenario for the San Jose cards yet - it's only a security / time to spend issue, as it's perfectly doable to reflash them to the latest firmware. So you should keep them and should be able to update at some point in the future.
@_date: 2014-12-02 08:24:43
thanks, and of course that's the public price. distributors get nice business opportunities with us :)
@_date: 2014-09-15 10:16:24
almost, but using a native Operating System. I have published an [open source Java Card version]( of a kind-of similar applet using non deterministic keys &amp; signatures (because you can't do that with standard Java Card APIs)
@_date: 2014-09-18 16:36:34
How do you think EMV credit cards are actually evaluated ?
Don't worry, we're here to stay :)
@_date: 2014-11-20 21:08:35
Being a smartcard, it only accepts signed firmwares and is totally immune against badusb, which is by the way a rather cheap attempt at PR whoring by claiming that "flashable microcontrollers can be flashed" is a new vulnerability.
@_date: 2014-11-21 07:31:42
Yes, same firmware and the Chrome application supports BIP 39 &amp; BIP 44
@_date: 2014-09-15 00:08:53
That's quite odd if the previous button worked. Any debugging could help (Chrome console or whatnot)
@_date: 2014-11-20 20:26:35
yes, that's a known risk, but it raises the bar significantly for the common malware, and that's a convenience / security thing. In the meantime, people concerned about it can revert to the old [type your transaction on a different device second factor](
@_date: 2014-11-26 19:32:44
Same hardware as Ledger Wallet for now - can be considered as the developer edition, or the special events edition.
@_date: 2014-11-20 22:18:29
yes exactly.
@_date: 2014-09-18 15:21:12
Also to OP, which wallet would you like to use it with ?
@_date: 2014-11-24 08:26:12
Partially, wait a bit, I'm working on sample Python interoperability use cases
@_date: 2014-12-15 17:59:36
badUSB-style attacks are totally unrelated to having a display - badUSB just means that unprotected devices can be reflashed - which is not the case for Trezor or us, as both devices validate a firmware signature before flashing. 
It is also a totally over hyped vulnerability and there have been [much more scary demonstrations]( of exactly the same extremely obvious thing done way back.
Our product, being a Secure Element, offers a protection of the private keys compared to Electrum and an AES-encrypted $5 flash drive. A malware can fetch the keys as they get from the flash drive to the computer memory, then it's game over forever.
Supposing a malware can defeat our second factor, it can ask the device to sign arbitrary transactions, which is **not** the same thing : the private keys themselves are not compromised, and those attacks can be mitigated (for example by limiting the maximum output amount of a transaction). 
@_date: 2014-09-18 18:39:50
I know, but the specification will have to do for the time being - it should keep you busy for some time already :)
@_date: 2014-09-18 19:06:07
did you read it already ?
@_date: 2014-09-09 20:26:37
Yes, it's a big family  (sorry SigSafe missing, maybe next time :p)
@_date: 2014-11-12 11:31:33
Likely not for the current device, but I'm open to suggestions for the next one.
@_date: 2014-09-18 15:46:55
No, the chip vendor SDK (datasheet, header files) is under NDA. And the compiler is not really freely available either. So we could release parts of code that wouldn't make any sense, and that nobody would be able to compile or verify against the actual firmware either.
Rather than doing that, we figured than publishing [a fully detailed specification]( that let people evaluate the application as a blackbox would be good enough. 
So don't hesitate to read that specification and come back with comments regarding what you think is missing in there to be confident that you know what the chip is doing.
@_date: 2014-09-18 20:32:51
- The chip is an [ST23YT66]( smartcard - it cannot be physically attacked easily and the firmware can only be reprogrammed by authorized code (if the question was about BadUSB, I think I'm going to cry)
- GreenAddress sends your funds through a nLockTime transaction that you'll have to sign on your side to redeem - so there is no limitation, just make sure to request it periodically or get it automatically delivered to you (this should be the case if using a e-mail second factor, I think)
- The hardware wallet is reset (the seed is erased) by issuing 3 times an invalid PIN in a row. So it's easy to start over or to give it to someone else.
- All wallets are blank. You're free to set them up as you see fit (they can mirror each other, or be related to totally different accounts or services - your choice) 
- There is no FAQ yet, but we're working on it. Also a few tutorials are coming up, I'm keeping them on [the first page of our bitcointalk thread]( 
@_date: 2014-11-20 21:46:51
The Chrome Application is open source : 
The Ledger Wallet itself is open spec : 
@_date: 2014-10-13 06:23:53
you have this  along with my educated opinion and you'll have to do your own due diligence for more :)
@_date: 2014-11-07 13:15:41
The only reason is that I had to remove a less important feature to fit a more important one in a very limited code space. If you don't trust the chip RNG, you can provide your own seed.
@_date: 2015-05-06 14:21:01
yes, same as before
@_date: 2014-11-20 22:05:13
Yes, you may see different indices. But in the end, that wouldn't be very useful (if the malware knows what to answer it can just overwrite your response) 
The security card is a unique per device substitution of A..Z 0..9 - this is what you match.
@_date: 2014-09-15 00:15:43
Also keep in mind that a smartcard microcontroller is better protected against physical attacks (power analysis or just a good old JTAG) than a generic microcontroller.
And yes, owning both is the wise choice :)
@_date: 2015-05-03 00:12:00
You'd still need some external connectivity to send and receive SMS, so it's not free.
@_date: 2014-09-15 10:44:48
you don't (you don't know either if the chip manufacturer didn't do that), so the best option is to provide your own seed if you don't trust it
@_date: 2015-05-27 18:30:29
what is bitcoin economy ?
@_date: 2015-05-19 22:46:22
I think this feature allows you to do that
@_date: 2015-05-11 10:25:13
you can also [print your own card]( now 
@_date: 2014-09-15 10:54:26
yep that's outdated even. I should remove that. Thanks :)
@_date: 2015-05-02 16:20:33
I've been doing that stuff for 15 years and I also have issues to cut through the marketing blurb if it makes you feel better.
I commented significantly on the technical points in  though.
@_date: 2015-05-02 22:03:59


That's mostly unrelated - I mean, the proxy SIM is not related to  the SIM, and doesn't need the SIM or operator authorization to work, that's the whole point of doing it that way
So you'd use an external service (such as [Bitrefill]( to move funds in Bitcoin to your prepaid account, the proxy makes this easier, but that's about it.
@_date: 2015-05-23 09:10:29
then how do you choose the new (transfer) wallet ? 
@_date: 2015-05-04 23:54:25
yeah well it is from the beginning since the device cannot be standalone (it wouldn't make much economical sense to offer free GSM bandwidth worldwide to download blocks) so at least keeping it as dumb as possible makes things easier.
@_date: 2015-05-31 16:28:20


a hardware wallet with the same limitations as connecting a HW.1 to a mobile phone today (using some second factor compromise to validate the transaction being signed)
@_date: 2014-12-12 18:21:43
even if our frenglish presentations are bad, seems that you missed the NSA slides :p 
@_date: 2015-05-13 15:46:26


BitID works without Ledger or any kind of hardware wallet (it's directly supported from Mycelium for example), TREZOR Connect does not ... how do you recover your TREZOR Connect credentials if you lose your device ?
simple enough I think.
@_date: 2014-12-10 16:13:12
also FWIW secure chips can be way cheaper than general purpose microcontrollers :)
@_date: 2014-11-07 09:20:59
the "user entropy" part has been removed from the recent firmwares, only the device entropy is used.
@_date: 2015-05-23 21:19:34
yes, it definitely depends who is attacking you (you're testing 2^79 SHA-256 and not 2^79 PBKDF2 iterations)
@_date: 2015-05-31 16:03:27
yes, it's possible to do that. After logging in with the mnemonic, you can go to the settings page and write it to a new HW.1
@_date: 2015-05-18 06:29:36
if you're using Linux and just plan to use one device, you can build a kernel with all drivers as modules and blacklist the ones you don't want to use - or use  for more convenience
@_date: 2014-10-13 06:19:16
it's not - we both have funny accents though.
@_date: 2015-05-04 22:08:05
no in the OP scenario you lose 2 keys. But that's a problem rated to putting all your funds in a multisig scenario managed by a third party, not to Case. Multisig is great to reduce the risk for businesses, not so great for users who have to jump through more hoops to recover their funds.
@_date: 2015-05-06 16:25:47
Also the TEE application, technically not a device but still interesting if your phone supports it - 
@_date: 2014-09-15 00:17:57
Actually the hot wallet server part is missing the "transaction limit" part as we run out of space, but that should be fixed in a firmware update.
Thanks for the submission nonetheless :)
@_date: 2015-05-04 20:48:39
being always connected to the GSM network could be a way to get remote code execution on the device. From here you don't really care if it's multisig since the device is driving all the transaction.
@_date: 2015-05-02 18:27:27
yeah, I believe you. Philippines was the hottest country when we deployed SMS based mobile banking applications in the 2000s (along with Romania)
@_date: 2015-05-11 10:12:45
I used  and imported the first derived BIP 44 key manually. So the recovery should have worked with both. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 00:10:11
Yes, that could be a bit more clear, but don't hesitate to ask any kind of security question here :)
@_date: 2015-05-23 08:12:55


why ? it's more about audits than thoughts here.


you can restore on any wallet supporting BIP 39/BIP 44, that's why standardization is good.


I don't think anyone said that TREZOR was mandatory, but it's hard to deny that hardware wallets provide better security on untrusted platforms, in a way that's easier to set up and harder to fuck up than other solutions.
@_date: 2014-09-18 20:18:46
Yes, it's using RFC 6979 (if configured to use it, which is the default as it's popular) - you can prove that by comparing your signature with another oracle configured with the same seed signing the same message (software, Trezor, another BTChip dongle ....) 
@_date: 2015-05-06 18:28:12


your [keyboard]( can also get backdoored. Now it's more tricky to use your computer
@_date: 2017-02-20 12:46:19
yes, that was a [recent addition](
@_date: 2017-02-24 06:06:27
No, not fine, a memory leak server side means that any secret could have been leaked in plain text - its complexity doesn't matter, change it ASAP if it was used on an affected site.
@_date: 2015-05-02 03:34:09
so, in the end, is it working or not ? 
Sorry, not clear at all in the message :)
@_date: 2015-05-04 21:43:14
would make more sense to do everything server side and only sign on the device in my opinon
@_date: 2015-05-13 18:04:15


then they can't use the plugin because they aren't whitelisted.
@_date: 2015-05-08 20:48:53
Looks very cool, also quite close from the backend I made myself with bitcoinJ for the former BTChip shop, so I won't have to clean that up and publish it :) 
Two suggestions from the trenches : 
- I've seen people that split a payment from N different wallets. Not sure it supports it.
- Could be nice to make a side library for a totally safe server : encrypt customer credentials locally with [OpenPGP.js]( before sending them to the server, and create the invoice locally with [PDF.js]( so that the customer details never touch the server unencrypted.
@_date: 2015-05-23 13:40:45
Let's change my previous sentence to neither convenient nor secure then.
if you want to restore securely, you have to be able to enter the words on the device itself.
@_date: 2014-10-13 07:55:26
it's their (Satoshilab) decision to post it and having some binary blobs is still a quite common practice in embedded development.
moreover posting a reversed source code won't prove anything regarding what's running in your specific device - if you're concerned enough to ask for this, you should be able to go through the reversing steps yourself to be convinced. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 07:31:17
by supporting colored coins ? 
ok sorry, morning jokes are not good.
@_date: 2015-05-01 05:41:19
They're also not patentable.
@_date: 2014-12-10 13:05:58
Indeed. I'll try to give it a non tl;dr look later today.
@_date: 2015-05-11 14:21:22
and I did it lazily with Electrum and a more or less random value to get it before someone else did
@_date: 2015-05-17 20:26:40
in a covert channel, the result is valid - it's just organized in a way that provides information to an external observer. This is what this specification tries to avoid.
@_date: 2015-05-31 16:16:46
you'll need to remove it and insert it again between each wrong PIN attempt.
@_date: 2015-05-06 16:42:13
the update process is getting improved, especially the first time you update on Windows which doesn't like devices switching through different USB IDs - it should be fully transparent after the 2 next updates (we'll still have to go through the old update process once for current users).
It's already quite painless on Linux and Mac.
@_date: 2015-05-17 19:27:16
I understand that as "on every master seed generation"
@_date: 2015-05-06 18:56:36


they were since Ledger was created from the merger of 3 companies including BTChip, but the shops were not. So it was a bit confusing.


It was the same firmware, but not the same initialization procedure, resulting in non compatible features. Now all features are available for both.
@_date: 2015-05-23 06:18:46


that holds until you try to actually use them, supposing it was generated with proper entropy in the first place
@_date: 2015-05-31 17:14:35
for sure, as long as you keep your mnemonic safe you can't mess up anyway
@_date: 2015-05-01 05:47:19
Patents have a valid use case if they're used to cover a complex (for someone of the trade) and costly R&amp;D process that could be duplicated in no time by a competitor.
Of course, almost no software patent matches that.
@_date: 2015-05-02 17:02:36


yes (the proxy SIM technically)


yes, but outside of the OS. So you have a kind of ghetto guaranteed minimalist user interface through Sim Toolkit, and the upper OS might also be able to talk to it in some cases.
@_date: 2015-05-07 03:24:42
@_date: 2017-02-20 15:59:01
well they run out of the box with NW.js ...
@_date: 2017-02-15 08:55:48
yes, it's a protocol standard described in [BIP 39]( - not something product specific. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 09:46:20
Just that restoring on any hardware wallet is not convenient today.
@_date: 2015-05-27 16:57:38


because unless you're Harry Seldon it's pretty much impossible to do so. 
Limiting Bitcoin to an engineering problem is precisely not considering the whole system - it's as much an engineering problem as an economical problem as a sociological problem. Many different people use Bitcoin for different and conflicting reasons. 
Let's enjoy the ride, try to make it smooth and see what it will grow or wither into. 
@_date: 2015-05-01 23:17:54
That's the theory. In reality, it's way different, and that's why software patents are annoying (otherwise, software could very well be patentable worldwide, and close to no patents would be issued anyway) - there's a clear economical incentive for everybody involved (lawyers, examiners) to pass as many patents as possible and no penalties for accepting bogus patents.
@_date: 2015-05-13 16:10:20


Just show me how you connect to a TREZOR Connect website without a TREZOR then.
@_date: 2017-02-19 15:24:18


well it's pretty sure that this isn't related to the device
@_date: 2015-05-07 02:30:12
does this Jedi mind trick work ?
@_date: 2015-05-23 08:06:46


so in the end, the encryption doesn't really matter because your keys are as secure as the application sweeping it. 
@_date: 2015-05-12 14:55:55
yes, it was quite interesting and done on non NDA-ed hardware. I think that the author lacked some funding to move forward though.
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:13:45
do you have the txid ?
@_date: 2017-02-22 15:34:52
Sure, you have a backup that you can keep on paper or on a [CryptoSteel]( and restore on [any compatible wallet](
@_date: 2017-02-23 07:44:16
In layman's terms : No funds are at risk for anybody - worst case scenario you perform a mnemonic recovery with some software and can't find your full balance - you'll be able to recover it with another software.
It's messy though, so developers are investigating to pinpoint the exact issue and make sure all software agree on the implementation.
@_date: 2017-02-19 21:49:58


we're working on one (since Chrome apps are sunset) but in the meantime you can also run the existing Chrome app directly in [NW.js]( after building it from [Github](
@_date: 2015-05-28 09:49:45


you sound slightly biased


considering being a top miner is a temporary condition, that still seems like a significant improvement, even operating under the worst possible use case.


which ones ? people invest in bitcoin for different reasons


I'd say that's because so far R&amp;D in mining has been focused on maximizing the hashing power per watt, not looking for the minimal hashing power that'd make sense for the minimal power consumption possible considering a deployment on billion of units.
@_date: 2014-11-21 14:16:12
Yes, I've reported that.
@_date: 2015-05-23 21:57:25
Validating the checksum is enough to filter valid sequences to start with, this only involves SHA-256. 
It takes enough time to transfer the coins, maybe. Then you need another secure address to transfer the coins to.
It'd just be so much easier to enter the words on the device itself and keep it there, or restore on a trusted offline computer.
@_date: 2017-02-07 06:33:12
yes, you can't use the USB connection on iPhones, but we'll have BLE support coming for the Blue. On Android it can also be used with Greenbits or Greenaddress
@_date: 2015-05-06 15:13:58
yes, everything is similar. It's just a different form factor.
@_date: 2015-05-21 10:08:07
you don't really care in that case. If you just want to avoid having your mass storage behaving as a keyboard, ban keyboards other than your main one.
@_date: 2015-05-30 14:58:56
the technology itself is not really new - there have been companies putting Secure Elements in Micro SD cards for a long time (such as [Certgate]( 
could be interesting if there's TrustZone support into that, but since so far ARM strategy is only to support TrustZone for high end processors, probably not, but it's a bit too short on details so far.
@_date: 2014-12-16 16:40:36
It should also be extremely easy to put in a Chrome application when finalized, if that's a close target.
@_date: 2015-05-22 05:38:05
yes, likely not. I plan to get back to it when my quite long backlog is done. On the good side I'll have some strong motivation to do it for the next firmware which will be more Windows friendly re. updates
@_date: 2017-02-07 10:48:34
The Chrome app already prompts you for validation but doesn't display the fee amount in the local currency so it can be confusing - we're currently working on that
@_date: 2017-02-24 05:27:46
sorry about that, just make sure you also sent your logs for investigation - the API is under an heavier load those days but nobody ever lost coins with our product, if you see the transaction on a block explorer it's there
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:11:20
No, we're using bitcoinjs for the public key derivation with the Chrome app
@_date: 2017-02-06 22:09:25
We want to keep the UX simple on purpose - so showing the fee amount in dollars is acceptable, giving the amount per byte or letting the user choose less so.
For more advanced features on a non multisig wallet we'd advise to use Electrum on desktop, Mycelium on mobile.
@_date: 2015-05-12 20:30:15
Card emulation NFC is usually associated to smartcard chips, because they include silicon logic to gather energy from the field and power the microcontroller - the interesting part here is that the energy harvesting part is split from the low power generic microcontroller logic, allowing to design an open hardware system behaving the same way.
@_date: 2015-05-06 16:05:31
yes but that one works :) hardware didn't change a bit, which is the tricky part.
@_date: 2015-05-23 06:03:41
you have about the same issue if you want to restore it though.
@_date: 2017-02-20 23:15:17
Looking at that quote from the lead (only ?) Classic developer, I'd say that the situation is slightly worse than that 


@_date: 2017-02-19 12:55:56
please try to email your logs to support next time it happens - this would make it possible for the team to understand the issue and fix it
@_date: 2017-02-24 05:24:51
wow, another great advertisement for U2F (only storing public keys server side for the 2FA authentication rather than a shared secret)
@_date: 2015-05-02 18:20:54
Yep, good summary. 
Apps sideloaded are theorically possible. I'd be interested to do a similar Open Source thing too, starting with [our reference applet](
@_date: 2015-05-25 14:40:29
[The manufacturer]( likes to show them off - it's a demonstration card, not linked to a real account.
@_date: 2015-05-31 18:35:40
an open SIM proxy (with a Java Card secure element to which you have the keys) would allow you to do the same thing, with that extra communication channel on top. Also a very tiny SIM proxy could work on an iPhone.
There are been similar designs on Micro SD cards available for a long time (by Certgate, Giesecke &amp; Devrient, DeviceFidelity and probably more people) - the innovation here is that the design will be open source, which is great especially if the CPU supports some kind of secure enclave à la TrustZone, but we don't know that yet.
In any case I'll line up for a beta kit of course
@_date: 2014-11-25 00:28:44
Now pushed in  if you feel like playing with it
(also there seems to be an issue with Coinkite rejecting the response if signed by a testnet key version, forcing mainnet works)
@_date: 2015-05-13 16:15:25


oh well actually [we used to]( (wipe PIN), it's getting redesigned because nobody was using it.


that's not really the way we work
@_date: 2015-05-06 19:00:32


I'd say GCM on Android, and the equivalent on iPhone. Initially we wanted to use WebRTC but had some issues to deploy it. In any case, the transaction content is end to end encrypted between the Ledger Wallet and the phone application, so nothing is revealed.


your choice, you can either keep using Ledger Wallet with the keycard, replacing the phone, or use the keywords to restore on a different Ledger Wallet or a compatible wallet.
@_date: 2015-05-13 17:27:20


oh sure, [I guess we started that one](
@_date: 2015-05-04 20:38:09
likely competitors, but hard to exactly say until APIs are published
@_date: 2017-02-06 18:00:05
Only that the max fee per byte is [not set to a ridiculously high value]( - it doesn't help much if you have to check a high-ish fee considering the current exchange rate.
@_date: 2014-11-28 05:13:28
yes, it's fully arbitrary. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 15:51:52
it's not "much better". Different devices to solve similar problems in different scenarios, and all that.
@_date: 2015-05-06 18:53:21
You'd query the previous transactions from the blockchain then use an offline tool (which doesn't exist yet, but the [C APIs]( are close enough) to create and sign a new transaction.
@_date: 2017-02-14 07:33:21
The STM32 is absolutely not secure hardware. With a Secure Element we can guarantee that the chip is genuinely coming from us and that the code running on it is also running on a genuine platform, enabling interesting new use cases (described in

Also related to 
Oh and I run a quick check, 44'/0' with this mnemonic and passphrase generates a private key starting with FF, so maybe yet another edge case ?
@_date: 2017-02-19 23:33:57
Quite secure - the usual anti tampering / anti glitching provided by the chip and the check is done in constant time.
@_date: 2017-02-27 07:16:57


Nobody has any idea what Bitcoin will look like at that point. Maybe miners will be happy with 1 Mb blocks (after all you can still collect about 21 millions btc of fees per transaction). Maybe blocks will be larger. Maybe the network would have crashed a long time ago.


actually they're not. There are basically 2 ASIC manufacturers and each one promotes a different solution so it's a nice draw.
@_date: 2017-02-19 16:19:21
No need to risk compromising the seed to verify this issue - testing with a third party wallet compatible with the Nano S (such as Electrum or Mycelium on Android) should be enough.
@_date: 2017-02-22 10:07:46
The client wallet checks every 5 minutes, but the backend might have run into a new error condition we didn't see before and return bogus information if it reported 1 satoshi per byte. 
There's no time guarantee about when the transaction will expire. I suggest you contact support with the TX information and your logs so we can investigate and see if something can be done on the backend to override it.
@_date: 2015-05-04 17:29:00
that's some serious TLDR :)
more seriously, anyone has a summary ? 
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:05:42
not affected
@_date: 2015-05-16 11:29:19
Nice tool, I appreciate that it doesn't accept uppercase mnemonic words unlike others. 
Also you should rename "Trezor k'th account" to "BIP 44 k'th account" as this one is standardized for multiple implementations.
@_date: 2015-05-31 16:06:44
you can also check that it's legitimate [with its ID](

Our Ledger Wallet application is intended as an entry point, easy to use way to handle your bitcoins - we keep it minimalist on purpose and try to make it as easy as possible to integrate with third party services providing added value. 
So definitely try Coinkite and see how you like it :)
@_date: 2014-12-18 09:27:24
it's ok as you still need your PIN to use it and you create the seed yourself - we (Ledger) cannot do anything with just the second factor card.

@_date: 2015-05-31 19:48:41
Yes, although it'll be competing with the SIM card, embedded Secure Elements, and Trusted Execution Environments in those areas. Its strong points are the Open Source architecture, "plastic roaming" across devices, and possibly an associated large storage area with an interface fast enough to do on the fly encryption.
Oh and another [almost related device](
@_date: 2017-02-24 10:30:57
Facebook recently accepting U2F should help. Also it'd be great to distribute  (or a cheaper version of it) around and spread the word that way

it happened in the past when the load went up and the old server architecture, but shouldn't occur now - that's why your logs will help understanding the problem

yes, but we made that complicated enough to do.


first one was a bug in a totally different situation, second one is unrelated to the user seed


same thing (asymmetric signature) with symmetric encryption on top


the chip has one, but there is no API to retrieve it because we figured that was important for bitcoin privacy.

You get a single opportunity to steal it, i.e. when the wallet is set up. Not something that you're supposed to repeat many times during normal product operation, then that risk can be mitigated (do it offline to avoid keyloggers, do it Citizenfour style to avoid cameras ...)

No, nothing to update on the Electrum side. 
No news about full node support either on our app, but I'm planning to work on this during the [wallet developers meetup]( in April.

You can find cross references of the physical protection measures in an EAL5 Target Of Evaluation for a [similar platform]( - the PIN validation itself is part of our kernel so not Open Source yet, but that part can be opened without problems later (and someone interested to test it can verify that it's operating in constant time dealing with the chip as a black box in the meantime)
@_date: 2015-05-13 15:49:20


it's not a problem, more like, different devices for different scenarios. The Nano has been designed to be the cheapest most secure possible device for large volumes. 
@_date: 2016-03-03 09:04:04
no, but you can audit parts of it, and reduce the scope of the non auditable parts as you move along. Considering you always compromise at some point when using hardware, the Blue is our reference implementation, featuring what we estimate to be the best balance between running on secure hardware and being open.

A TEE can deal with key generation issue, generating the key itself in a way that can be verified (and also with malware that'd change the public key/QR code when it's displayed if a Trusted UI is supported) 
[We had a blog entry on that topic](

It doesn't do the initialization part yet, but there's nothing preventing you from using a 12 words seed already today (probably not with the Ledger Wallet software though)

ok, we're not monitoring the backend but that seems really weird - we'll have a look at the fee estimation reported by our different nodes.

pbkdf2 is definitely doable, since it's what happens[ when going from the mnemonic to the seed in BIP 39]( (would take about 5 minutes to run on Ledger current architecture though)

yes if you store that encrypted repository on Dropbox protected by a device generated password or using "password" and a U2F second factor as it should be, it's kind of a circular problem.

does it work like beetlejuice ?
@_date: 2015-05-25 14:38:19
Well, people in the US didn't want to invest in smartcards because there were too many patents around those technologies in the 80s-90s. Now they might get ahead of Europe wth contactless services deployment, just because regular chips work too well to provide a good reason to upgrade.

Just run into them during our [annual gathering](
@_date: 2017-02-20 08:01:18


Right now yes but this will change with the next firmware


You'll have to recover with the seed. This will also change after the next firmware, which won't make it necessary for the following updates.


Yes it's a very good idea. It's more reliable than a paper backup, and it looks cool :)


Yes that's right. The BIP 39 dictionary (at least the default english one) has been chosen to make this possible.


I believe any well behaved wallet should prompt you when they do that and give you the change address. The problem is that you then have to create a new paper wallet for the change address. You can also send the change yourself to another paper wallet you have prepared to avoid the problem, but that's part of what makes proper paper wallet handling complex.


Most people are happy with the Chrome extension internally, and we definitely support all options for our users.
@_date: 2017-02-22 09:17:54
This might not be a mistake - hard to say without looking specifically at the TX. The important metrics are the size of the transaction and the reported fee-per-byte when you created it, as the fees estimations are fluctuating widely.
We don't support Replace By Fee yet (the wallet is getting redesigned on a different architecture) so the best option is to have the remote party use Child Pay For Parent to speed up the transaction if possible, or to try to double spend it yourself using a different wallet (we don't have a tutorial for that unfortunately)
@_date: 2014-09-18 15:06:08
Documentation will improve and we'll have better videos tutorial soon.
Also GreenAddress is quite easy to start with, with a single Chrome application to download.
Lack of schematics is not really an issue when you're using a single chip component :) 
Also check [this post]( to see how much trust you can put into the device - and [the specification]( which is comprehensive enough IMHO (I might be a bit biaised here, but GreenAddress basically integrated it in a few days)
@_date: 2015-05-31 22:39:43
Knowing that it's the default, sure, knowing that it wasn't tweaked is a useful information. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 21:27:38
no just that you hold the device with your fingers usually :)
@_date: 2017-02-27 07:55:16


different people would have different opinions about what makes Bitcoin valuable, in the meantime the only thing a casual observer can do is look at the hashrate, which is growing.


That's also quite debatable. We've seen on both the BTC and ETH networks that attacks can be complex and the block size can have an impact on those.

this. Use a passphrase and consider your non secure device compromised quickly if you lose it.
@_date: 2015-05-31 22:25:27
Considering the last stress test revealed some little known facts, such as the soft limit enforced by most miners, I think a larger stress test will help knowing what the limits actually are. For example, longer confirmation times are acceptable, disappearing nodes or transactions only visible on some part of the network not so much.
@_date: 2015-05-13 15:41:02


yes, we like open specifications. And we're also not pushing for proprietary and non interoperable protocols such as TREZOR Connect.


that'd be fine once the passphrase is mandatory. Then the security of the whole solution is only as strong as the passphrase once you get physical access to the device.

@_date: 2015-05-26 06:44:30
one of the biggest issue is that Full Disk Encryption is (hopefully was) not implemented properly. From [the paper](


key is stored encrypted with a key derived from a salt and
a user-provided PIN (or password) [...] Consequently, to logically
sanitise a device with encryption, it is essential to select
a strong password to thwart offline brute-force attacks. As
most people just use a 4-6 digit PIN, it would usually be
trivial to brute-force.
@_date: 2017-02-19 23:42:42
yes, that's why we're building new apps - also see

End of the yearish.
Attestation [is already supported]( - [keys are listed in the beta firmware specification]( because I failed. We'll be using this to issue discounts to customers having already bought a wallet without knowing them.

We will for the next products, at least for one part.
@_date: 2015-05-13 17:19:29
that point is clear enough. My issue is with how you connect all things together. 
BitID doesn't need some special plugin support, or a link to a JS hosted on our side which turns any login page into a giant advertisement for our product. Becase I don't think that'd be very good for interoperability or standardization purposes.
It works with a simple QR code or a link you can click, so everyone can freely support it and implement it, on a mobile or a desktop environment.
It works better with Ledger, but it also works **without** Ledger **out of the box**

great, I needed a TEE tester on a S7. Which model is it ? The UI will only work on the Exynos version unfortunately. Also you're getting this message because you should go back to the Bootstrap and purchase a license (but since you're the first user on a S7 I can give you one if you PM me your device ID)
@_date: 2016-01-21 05:03:01


No. There's a strong commitment from [a lot of wallets]( and the two leading Hardware Wallets (also note that having the code done in TREZOR makes it easy to merge in all products based on the same code such as KeepKey, B/E-Wallet if they're still breathing, the mysterious thing I saw in Hong Kong and the bazillion other clones). Things are happening very fast, as we speak, so I don't really know where the supposed 1 year SegWit deployment delays are coming from.
@_date: 2015-05-06 15:56:05
It's also safe if you lose it - everything will be wiped after 3 wrong PINs. 
So the only thing to really keep safe is the paper backup.
@_date: 2015-01-29 17:25:53


it's not really a concern if you can't get to the secret in the first place


Because you get a documentation of all inputs and outputs, and all clients are open source, so you can check that only documented functions are called, thus closing the loop.


Because bugs happen ? it's a super special edge case that has absolutely no security impact


by testing more ? see, it works, you found it :)
@_date: 2015-01-18 04:23:49
This is one interesting situation where open source brings nice things, closed hardware brings different nice things, and mixing both is actually an interesting, necessary and complex problem.
@_date: 2015-01-11 22:48:10
I'll try to fiddle around entering three wrong PINs while there's a seed being typed, that should do it. Thanks for the useful report as always :)

secure elements make a difference here by upgrading the time needed from a few minutes to a few days/weeks/months if planned carefully enough. 
I mean, we're all having fun here debating how to fix the code, the endgame is to attack the core, reenable JTAG, then it's game over forever. Supposing it wasn't done already. 
@_date: 2015-01-29 15:41:41


this is basically what we say when talking about the NDAs associated to that chip.

@_date: 2015-05-28 07:47:22


I hope none. VCs are usually not in the business of gambling their fund money on risky assets.


depends when they entered the game and what they invested on.


If the goal is to be fully trustless probably. If the goal is to be trustless enough to have a system that is hard to cheat or shutdown, thus better than existing fully centralized solutions probably not.


why do you think it's necessary to drop it that much ?


in a more distributed way, yes, which is the point. More efficient chips make it possible to have more people securing the network for a neglectable cost per user, which is hopefully the point of 21 Inc and conveniently puts the price out of the equation, at least for individual users.


I think people are more flexible than you think they are. For example there's already work going on with lightning networks even if that mean getting more centralized for some time.


Who knows what will happen if they have to choose between that or losing more.
@_date: 2017-02-19 22:20:11


Firmware 1.3 will support a variable PIN size up to 8 digits and you can still have an [additional BIP 39 passphrase]( 
An attacker can get infinite retries on a paper wallet password while you only have 3 attempts for the PIN, also properly using a paper wallet is complex for many users. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:08:51
It's not a silver bullet, it's just the best tool for the job when you want to deal with secrets.
Side channel protection requires the same kind of work on the software side you'd have to do on a generic microcontroller, you just get some help from the hardware because it's less noisy, and also the manufacturer often provides a well tested cryptographic library you can use, which is great because SPA is easy enough but DPA is harder and also a patent minefield. I also agree that side channel attacks are not the main threat for your device.
Glitching (targeted modification of the execution flow) is a totally different story - a decent smartcard will protect you against trivial glitching by checking voltage variations and operating on a variable clock - something that generic microcontrollers can't do. The 31c3 "glitching for noobs" talk provides a good introduction if you're interested. Those attacks are quite powerful and can be executed very quickly (within seconds or minutes) for a low budget (couple dollars usually) after the initial set up.
 
@_date: 2015-01-11 23:06:58
I believe both can meet in the middle, that's another good thing with Bitcoin. Sergio Demian Lerner is already making a step in that direction with

1. You can check the specification (see below)
2. It actually offers 2 ways to check what you're signing with [the current firmware]( and 4 ways to do it with [the next firmware] (
@_date: 2015-01-28 22:54:48
I also hope that the TREZOR team will revert on that decision - being Open Source is first and foremost a political standpoint, and backing off when the first unskilled abuser appears doesn't send a good signal IMHO.
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:50:30
Yes, the security card used as it is today is a temporary thing. In the very close future, using a firmware update that'll work on all released devices of course, you'll have the following options to check what you're sending :
- The original keyboard-second-factor-thing. Great if you have two computers nearby, or one computer and a phone + USB OTG cable, as you'll get all the transaction information. Not so user friendly though. 
- Using the Security Card to pair transactions. OKish if you don't plan to perform a lot of transactions (typically on the go, on an untrusted computer) and if you don't think changing the amount you're paying is an attack vector for your transaction. More user friendly than the keyboard method, but still annoying.
- Using the Security Card to pair a smartphone application, which will be used as a remote screen displaying the transaction information. Best solution if you have a smartphone, as it'd require to compromise both the host computer and the smartphone and then to synchronize the attack between both devices to defeat this protection. Quite user friendly.
- Using BIP 70 personal certificates if you plan to send Bitcoins several time to the same person also owning a Ledger Wallet. This would approve the transaction automatically after the certificate is imported, and also make sure that addresses are not tampered with before being displayed.
The last two methods are described in our [beta firmware specification]( if you wish to get more details.

@_date: 2015-05-04 21:31:38
yes in that case if you don't act on upcoming events you're limited to a risk of compromising the baseband and impersonating the server, which should also be mitigated by whitelisting the addresses this subscription can connect to.
@_date: 2015-01-27 23:56:16
2 of 2 with yourself is complicated - at some point you have to create the P2SH address and this is a single point of failure IMHO.

yeah, that's getting popular. I've seen smaller designs with ST rectennas I think.
@_date: 2015-01-29 21:59:37
Ledger products are based on smartcards, so they're less easy to glitch by design.
Avoiding side channels is more a code thing, and smartcard chip manufacturers offer well tested libraries. 
One downside being the associated NDAs preventing a useful Open Source release.
@_date: 2015-01-29 00:33:19
no real problems for that, as an unsupported device (i.e. not having an official attestation certificate - not sure anyone is checking this for the time being anyway). 
the only tricky part I can imagine would be to support another couple of HID endpoints on the 0xF1D0 usage page
@_date: 2015-01-29 11:52:39

This architecture is quite nice for Chrome/Chromium based applications (more secure than a regular website as everything is stored locally) and on the plus side, it also makes interoperability with Ledger Wallet easier :)

We're looking for a smartcard manufacturer that wouldn't mind having a binary blob hiding the specific secret chip stuff and an open software on top of it, and also provide a nice chip (features and price wise). Not holding our breath though. 
We'll also try another easier approach on our third design, including BLE + NFC + USB + a screen and buttons, based on two chips : a low power / low end non secure microcontroller handling the BLE core that can run Open Source code, and a closed source Secure Element that runs the critical Bitcoin transaction processing.
When using our signed firmware, the non secure microcontroller can talk to the Secure Element, otherwise it is disabled.
It's again a compromise, but an interesting one in my opinion, as developers will be free to implement all Bitcoin related things on the non secure microcontroller if they want.
@_date: 2015-01-27 23:16:39
I have no idea and I don't plan to try it (Satoshilabs is actually paying for those resources and "myTREZOR Web Wallet is a free service provided exclusively to TREZOR hardware wallet owners" as it's nicely mentioned on the website)

It's a bit tricky - to summarize, only Chrome applications can access USB devices, not web pages. So you need to install a Chrome application first. Then you're loading a web page, which wants to access the device, so it must talk to the Chrome application. Unfortunately there's no direct way to do it without relying on proprietary Chrome messaging extensions, so there's another extension that bridges HTML 5 messages to Chrome messages to establish a bridge between the web page and the Chrome application. Seems kludgy but it works - it's still cleaner to have everything in a single Chrome application though (such as GreenAddress or the Ledger Wallet application)
I think you're more likely to be able to install a Chrome extension in an Internet Cafe as it's fully integrated into the browser and can be reverted rather than a plugin or a daemon which are native code, but that's just my opinion there.
@_date: 2015-01-27 20:51:41
1. Yes (there's even a picture of it)

@_date: 2015-01-11 22:56:10
yes, the trust model is different for that kind of chips, but it often works (and sometimes [doesn't]( - next step would be to publish a community reviewed Protection Profile, and enter a regular evaluation process. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 18:12:03
Physical attacks matter if someone steals your wallet and can break it in a few minutes. 
"NSA attack" can be summarized as having an attestation key. It's important to recognize your device as being an authentic device, and the ability to do that is closely related to the ability of securely keeping a secret.
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:34:00

- Flash your own unofficial firmware that dumps the bootloader 
- Hash the bootloader dump 
- Compile the bootloader from github, check the hash 
- It matches, good, you know that the device is not lying, otherwise you can start using torches &amp; pitchforks that were not forgotten in front of Satoshilabs office

Talk was done today. Yes, there'll always be ways to extract information from hardware, the plan here is to make it as difficult as possible and to point generic errors.
Code secrecy is definitely not the answer - if someone gives me a hardware device that provides the benefits of a smartcard without the attached NDAs I'll be very happy to use it.
@_date: 2015-01-29 15:25:05
this model is used by several industries, and seems to hold quite well so far. You don't have to trust anything - you can run your own blackbox tests.
we're also fully supportive of the Open Source model, when it makes sense, and use every opportunity to push it - it just isn't possible for this firmware.
@_date: 2015-01-27 20:17:15
yes. Same chip, same wiring, so you can even load the TREZOR 1.3.0 firmware on it if you don't feel comfortable with the modifications (and don't mind getting an 'unofficial firmware' warning on every boot). 
My only beef with the hardware itself would be that the USB connector feels a bit weird (too hard, or a bit misplaced, hard to say).
I'd also advise to take a nice good look at the last picture of the album if you plan to distribute it in Europe.
@_date: 2015-05-06 18:57:43
normal option
@_date: 2016-03-02 22:00:40
updating the Operating System might do it - which version are you currently running ? 
@_date: 2015-05-06 18:45:59
merging of HW.1 shop and Ledger shop, basically.
@_date: 2015-01-22 10:37:54
so basically, you added a unique ID to the firmware, supposedly to track your own products, but you want a free lunch on someone else backend they're actually paying for.
Shanzhai is all fun but this is a bit over the top.
@_date: 2017-02-16 06:13:42
A bit more tamper resiliance than an STM32 is not too ambitious considering that it has none. There are already plenty of options for Hardware Wallets - it'd likely help if you could describe your architecture more precisely.
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:35:45
You can still review [our specification]( to get more confident :)
@_date: 2015-01-27 20:48:40
I tried it with Electrum and the command line tools, and it works well.
I didn't try it with MyTrezor as Satoshilabs is actually paying for the backend &amp; resources, and I didn't try their website as it seems to require Java on Linux.
About the plugin modification yes, I plan to do it at some point. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:59:44
You can, for some definitions of seeing.
@_date: 2016-03-30 14:58:47
well it still helps a lot - you know who to blame and who to avoid, as you're sure that nobody else could have planted it.
@_date: 2015-01-12 17:23:32
Also we have a brand new subreddit  which might be preferred in that case :)
@_date: 2015-01-22 14:12:28
In my opinion every vendor should offer the best (privacy, dedicated features wise) user experience for its own hardware wallet, while providing easy APIs to support common features in every other one.
@_date: 2015-01-18 13:00:02
Once prepared, a glitching attack takes minutes, not hours, and is doable for an average thief (see game console modding).
@_date: 2017-02-27 06:42:54


apparently enough to be willing to invest more hardware into it
@_date: 2016-03-29 09:18:19
yes, there are just not that many portable options for arbitrary multisignature right now.
@_date: 2017-02-23 07:56:12
Also while we're reviewing libraries for interoperability issues, you can have a look at  case 5. It's kind of unlikely to trigger on secp256k1 but I don't think any other library implements it (ping for a test vector just in case)
@_date: 2016-03-07 14:15:12
But according to you he shows good signs of leadership. So what was your point ?
@_date: 2015-01-30 23:09:51
It's going well and strong on mobile architectures with no users riot so far :)
@_date: 2016-03-20 16:00:00
no, we tried to be creative with Insight. Bad idea. Never be creative with Insight.
@_date: 2016-01-24 14:41:22


Technical merit of live upgrading a production system can be evaluated through test reports, I fail to see how to evaluate economic consensus though.
@_date: 2016-01-16 14:45:49


Bitcoin is a mix of technical, social and economical properties.
 The current development team has proven that they managed to create a working equilibrium (code didn't fall apart, well accepted by the market). New teams are chiming in claiming in a very vocal way that they have a better understanding of the social and economical parts.
That seems complicated to compromise, considering that the complex parts that made Bitcoin what it is today seem to be competing for the project governance now.
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:07:52
same thing, not affected.
@_date: 2015-01-11 22:50:48
yes, that's usually the lower end SIM cards (especially if you're referring to the 03.48 fuck up). You don't want to use those for anything secure, they offer very little improvements over generic microcontrollers (other than being smaller and cheaper)
@_date: 2015-01-22 10:02:05
honor usb.org sales conditions - it's safer 
"Each Vendor ID Number is assigned to one company for its sole and exclusive use"
@_date: 2015-01-22 10:22:49
ask Satoshilabs, maybe they can share the USB licensing cost with bidingxing.
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:03:32
we'll be introducing it at Mobile World Congress 2015 in Barcelona (along with another "device") and yes I think it's cooler than another cool asian competitor :)
@_date: 2015-01-29 10:36:13


no, you're confusing SPA and DPA. With SPA and well calibrated equipment or a good way to extract information, you need a single signature. 


if someone can do SPA from a distance (and that's hardly theorical - when you've a super chatty device and a cable, you're basically a broadcasting equipment with an antenna), a private key can be obtained remotely during the signature. I don't think I need to elaborate too much on how bad this is and how it could be abused.
@_date: 2015-01-17 18:09:35
Because a paper wallet stops being safe when you actually plan to use it
@_date: 2015-01-28 14:46:35
it'd cost about the same or if anything be cheaper. The tricky part is opening your source on the smartcard. This is why our third device will be both opened and closed (magic !)
@_date: 2015-05-31 20:59:08


yes, we have different strategies but I believe that the market is big enough for multiple good actors and there will always be users more supportive of a fully open source / community project as a personal choice.
@_date: 2015-01-27 20:53:09
thanks, I was desperate for someone to catch it.
@_date: 2015-01-11 22:13:42
The first point is described in our [beta specification]( - basically it'll be done like that
- The phone generates a keypair on Bitcoin curve, performs an ECDH with a dongle shared key and sends its public key to the dongle
- The dongle generates a symmetric pairing key and a challenge against the printed Security Card, and sends back the encrypted pairing key + challenge to the phone, using the ECDH shared secret.
- The phone prompts decrypts the pairing key and displays the challenge to the user, then send it back to the dongle. 
- If the challenge is correct, the pairing key can be saved by the phone
Then next time a transaction is performed, the dongle will create an encrypted message using the pairing key containing the transaction summary (destination, amount, fees, change and a transaction unique PIN). The phone displays the message, and sends back the transaction PIN if approved.
The phone will be pushed either through a rendez-vous point that we're currently defining (using websockets), or you could scan a QR code containing the encrypted transaction challenge then type the PIN when no network connectivity is available.
@_date: 2015-01-28 14:50:05
I think they already tried that :) funny conspiracy theory time - check out [Bitcoin Expo 2014 dates]( and [when BWallet created a github account](
@_date: 2015-05-26 06:33:55
those are all good points, also on the next update the flashing process will be much easier - the device won't change USB Product IDs during it, so things should be much smoother re. 2) 
and the update after that will allow flashing to the next version without needing the security card or backup seed.
@_date: 2016-01-03 13:30:34
so, it happened a bit later. Without specific optimizations it takes 1 minute and 41 seconds - still significantly better than the 3 minutes 30 seconds it takes on the ST23 but not really good enough to let users enter a passphrase at each boot.
@_date: 2015-01-11 23:29:11
yes, that's the idea. I think it's quite acceptable.
@_date: 2015-05-06 18:57:28
@_date: 2015-05-04 23:56:15
yeah, it might actually be worse if you keep a database of identity + badly encoded minutiae on a server - that'd probably be worth more than the bitcoins to some attackers
@_date: 2015-05-11 14:26:09
Also for people that want more performance, you'll be able to do the very same thing shortly with Ledger Trustlet on an old phone running Trustonic TEE, such as the Galaxy S3. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 20:47:49


no, they're french, spin off of the best ISP ever (Free) and I've been using them with absolutely no issue whatsoever since day 1.


yes, I'm Ledger CTO.
@_date: 2015-01-27 20:11:03
it's pretty much a 1:1 copy yes. PCB shots help verifying that.
@_date: 2016-03-02 21:26:51


consumer transactions ? facepalm.
@_date: 2015-01-28 10:35:08
no, looks pretty good regarding that - only problem is the USB connector, so I'd leave the cable connected to it and carry it around like that.
@_date: 2015-01-11 22:47:01
Yes, the dongle communicates to the phone via the computer, and the initial setup should be safe as the ECDH is done against a static public dongle key. The transaction summary is created by the dongle and encrypted end to end (dongle/phone)
@_date: 2015-05-28 04:13:58
It is perfectly possible to design a coherent business plan at least for a subset of the ecosystem, proof, all VC invested money so far. Unless you think that they're all morons of course.
you're the one asking for a 30 years business plan for something that you didn't describe yet, so it would make sense that you start working on it.
@_date: 2015-05-25 12:06:39
@_date: 2016-01-19 13:58:35
my comment was about producing SegWit transactions with a hardware wallet - of course you can still create old style transactions and see the SegWit transactions move around
@_date: 2016-03-01 06:38:34
as far as I understand it is indirectly a block size increase (through the witness data), and the issue with applying SegWit on top of 2 Mb blocks is that it can create situations where the overall increase goes over what is considered today as a safe limit for the network.
I'm pretty sure that this will be solved by more testing and tweaking after SegWit is deployed over 1 Mb blocks if there is a need to do so though.
That's the issue with being over specific or over promising in the scaling roadmap : users will feel betrayed if they don't happen, because they don't get to see (and that's ok) how sausage is made - a lot of new things about network limits and tricks are learnt, discussed, tried, kept or dropped along the way. It's an everlasting R&amp;D process.
People wanting to help with communication should make sure that this last point is widely understood : developers are not authoritarian deities, and scaling an emerging technology is a messy process
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:55:14
you need to sign NDAs to get the smartcard in the first place, so it's a chicken and egg issue :)
@_date: 2015-05-07 10:52:33
with the default client yes, then you decide. You can use it with a multisignature service too if you want to do so. Our vision is that hardware wallets should provide easy to use APIs, not lock you into some service.
@_date: 2017-02-20 12:49:06
yes, it'll be possible to enter the passphrase directly on device with firmware 1.3
@_date: 2016-03-21 00:32:45
Did I say we pushed it on Friday ? Unfortunately scalability issues don't stop during the week-end, servers still blow up during the week-end, and people have that annoying trend of going on week-ends during week-ends :)
@_date: 2016-03-06 17:13:35
that's something I'll probably change in the future - for the time being it only requests the PIN once, until the Mycelium application is closed. It would be better to check it at least every time Mycelium is paused in my opinion.
@_date: 2015-01-31 17:14:41
yes of course, it's complicated to prove that something is not here :)
@_date: 2015-01-28 23:17:11
It was trivial to dump the bootloader and analyze it anyway ([just look at the post date]( or just write your own, or just bypass it altogether, so well, not an issue.
@_date: 2015-05-07 02:27:59
Sure, if it's not too old. The Ledger Wallet Chrome application will let you do that, or you can also try from the [old update page](
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:21:41
Yes this works well, and is documented on our FAQ - 
@_date: 2016-03-03 16:16:26
Thanks, you're just missing the TEE :)
@_date: 2016-03-30 04:36:09


that sounds extremely hard to do considering none (excluding OpenDime) are seen as mass storage devices, and for those using Secure Elements (that includes Coolbitx and us (Ledger) AFAIK) the firmware can be cryptographically proven to be issued by the manufacturer
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:53:31
The wipe doesn't reset the Security Card if it's set at factory, correct. Not sure what you mean about the HID seed replay state ?
@_date: 2017-02-27 06:33:26


yet the hashrate is continuously increasing so maybe that's wrong ? and no, "but but it could be much higher" isn't an argument
@_date: 2016-03-31 04:52:33
considering you can steal that one by plugging it into something, it's not very different - NFC is just a bearer. I don't understand why so many people are afraid of it.
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:10:31
@_date: 2015-01-29 23:18:37
yes, that's easy enough, you just need to skip the [256 bytes header](
@_date: 2015-05-01 22:56:37
Re.1, I don't think releasing something as Open Source prevents someone else from patenting a related process. Then it can slip through the examination (wouldn't really be the first time that happens), and be an annoyance for everybody.
Re. 2, the wording of [Google OPN Pledge]( suggests a way to do that


IANAL, of course.
@_date: 2015-05-25 08:00:05
unfortunately, [some people take that seriously](
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:47:21
the upcoming BIP 70 payments will actually provide the best protection against remote hacks - you'll ackowledge knowing a remote party once and from this time on you're guaranteed than any payment sent to this party cannot be modified, without compromising privacy.
@_date: 2015-01-27 23:50:41
yes, it's a good chinese joke - not as good as the [matrioshka capacitor]( but cool enough 
@_date: 2015-01-31 21:55:11
Yes, you can still buy one or the other. They're basically the same thing, Ledger Wallet comes with better packaging, a more sturdy design, an already printed second factor security card (you'll be able to do the same with the upcoming HW.1 firmware if you print it yourself) and is shipped by express post.
@_date: 2015-01-29 16:03:52
Can you point to a situation that you wouldn't be able to reproduce through extensive testing and would end up to be profitable to exploit for an attacker ?
@_date: 2015-01-30 10:48:59
I did first [reverse engineer the bootloader]( before the public release to make sure everything was fine (it was) then rechecked it when it was public (it still was) then did all the above and everything was as expected.
@_date: 2015-01-29 00:48:57
It would work with GreenAddress TREZOR support though. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 04:16:03
This is not specific about trezor, protecting against theft is a quite valid use case for hardware wallets (especially when they're small and easy to lose, or an attractive target because people know there is supposed to be some coins on them)
@_date: 2015-01-28 22:52:04
after reading that license carefully I'm not even sure that you're allowed to compile the software.
@_date: 2015-05-11 09:55:40
oh, that one is tricky sometimes : you have to enter your mnemonic in lowercase. 
If you enter it in uppercase, it generates a perfectly valid **and different** seed. 
I recovered it, so feel free to post your new address to get your coffee back :)
 
@_date: 2016-01-10 18:24:16
yes, that step will definitely speed up the signing process when the previous transaction was large
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:07:57
I'd say with the Chinese translation
@_date: 2016-03-28 14:34:05
Copay can probably be a good approximation - it'd be nice to compare both feature set and see what's missing for end users.
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:59:10
also that, and you'd be supporting two projects with complementary scopes. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 22:49:28
yes, cheapest option. Also it'll end up being slightly thicker than a display card, but not much (so it'll still fit in a wallet, and we won't have to deal with annoying production and patent issues)
@_date: 2017-02-23 15:53:57
also not affected. That's really really specific to the Copay library.
@_date: 2016-01-19 04:53:27
it pops up when you are on a compatible website - you can try github or the test site 
@_date: 2015-05-21 13:15:16
I don't have time to look at it precisely, but the descriptors can be browsed from the filesystem
@_date: 2015-01-17 18:24:52
Yes, I believe that some hardware wallets will take minutes to disassemble and extract secrets from.
NSA might not been the best example, we're more talking about an attacker that would swap the device for another one without having infinite resources. Attestation prevents that.
@_date: 2015-05-05 12:42:39
oh great, I missed that. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-05-17 20:30:18
yes, especially if physical operations are done on the device.
@_date: 2016-03-22 23:06:13
Yes, you can use plenty of compatible wallets (see  and we'll soon add an SPV wallet for iPhone and Android, and transition towards an SPV oriented Chrome application as well. Probably also let you point to your own node at some point.
@_date: 2015-05-25 13:54:42
yes, belonging to Mr Cardholder
@_date: 2015-05-02 18:22:02
you could imagine offline, or off chain transactions with something like that though (and a proper reader on the receiving side)
@_date: 2015-01-28 17:36:25


[actually yes]( :)
@_date: 2015-01-11 22:29:31
that one is a bug, if it happens with 1.4.13 I should give it a look.
@_date: 2016-03-22 16:49:37
Our server is necessary for the Ledger Wallet Chrome application to work, and we'll be working on limiting that dependency with an SPV version later. It is also fine to use the device with another supported wallet (Coinkite, GreenAddress, Electrum, Copay on desktop, Mycelium, GreenAddress, GreenBits on Android).
@_date: 2015-05-02 03:51:10
ok, I'll ask the developers if they expect to be online at some point. it's probably a case of an incorrectly trapped error. 
regarding btchip-c-api, yeah, I think your hidapi library is probably located at a different location than the one expected in the Makefile
@_date: 2016-03-04 15:24:15
and unfortunately I still don't know how to reproduce it without a screenshot or logs.
@_date: 2015-01-29 14:55:23
We use a different model for validation - you can reimplement and check everything [from the specification]( against the card, because the behaviour is deterministic
@_date: 2015-01-29 12:10:26
yes, it's fairly new, but with all the buzz going around mbed and Arduino silicon vendors seem to finally realize than there's a market for hobbyists :)
@_date: 2015-05-25 07:59:05
it exists, and the technology behind it is well proven too
@_date: 2016-03-25 17:38:14


In that case, I guess I don't get those comments in the FAQ.




I'll look at it more closely when I get some free time. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 08:03:09
we've done yet another very large rewrite of our code for optimization and review purposes and managed to free a small memory area that can survive the new update process
@_date: 2015-01-28 13:36:02
Ledger CTO here (just in case people miss it), as slush said, different approaches, so just get both : by buying a TREZOR you support a full open source hardware &amp; software approach, by buying a Ledger Wallet you support pushing typical banking security tools towards Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-06 14:25:44
You should be able to set this one to 0 and the "Solo" to 1. Not sure why it does that on your configuration though.
@_date: 2015-05-17 20:19:06
what if a covert channel is present in the result of the computation ?
@_date: 2016-03-03 18:17:54
thanks. We're not, but could, likely will sooner than later. Regarding OpenRISC, I'd like if we could get that kind of funding.
@_date: 2016-01-25 11:57:39


ACKs/NACKs are supposed to be used by developers known by their peers to confirm a feature. They work pretty well for that, and should not be used for anything else.


From my perception it is wasted time since it will work well when it is not really needed and not work when it is the most needed. It probably makes users and developers feel good to have this tool, but it's only an illusion.
@_date: 2015-05-31 19:53:54
I'd also shamelessly suggest having a look at [online.net]( - their low end dedicated servers are quite nice to run nodes for about 10-20 euros/month.
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:57:09
we're definitely looking at solutions to bridge both worlds (and also the "let's virtualize everything" option) as there's no perfect solution today, and it's an interesting challenge.
@_date: 2016-03-02 12:05:46
And more surprises to come soon regarding this app :)
EDIT : one here 
@_date: 2015-01-24 19:33:59
This target of this talk was an introduction to secure embedded design and some common issues to avoid. It's not specific to TREZOR.
Slides 19 and 20 attack is also independently reported on  (saw that later)
@_date: 2016-01-26 22:14:42
that's the idea yes.
@_date: 2016-03-19 21:07:07
libsecp256k1 is definitely more secure - part of its design is to avoid those kind of attacks, while OpenSSL is usually patched after one specific attack is discovered.
@_date: 2016-03-03 17:58:42
it works as much as or as less as with any other hardware solution. You can't fully audit a generic microcontroller either. And you can document what you can (and can't) audit in a TEE.
@_date: 2017-02-19 12:02:51
It can be a synchronization issue - in that case it's best to email support with your logs to let the team check the issue then reset the data / delete the Chrome application and reinstall it to check if that fixes the problem
@_date: 2015-05-17 19:28:44
no privileged access as I understand it, so everybody could run the audit procedure
@_date: 2015-05-31 17:12:50
A SIM proxy such as BitSIM can display something and wait for user input with basic Sim Toolkit commands that are processed by the phone OS - so it's reasonably hard to hack on a feature phone. 
An SD card (or an external USB device) doesn't have this communication channel, so you'd have to confirm your transaction with no screen access nor user input, or trust a phone application to do that
@_date: 2015-05-31 23:18:16
Source + hardware design is already available @ 
@_date: 2017-02-04 10:01:59
also a few additional side effects that happen when you don't fully understand what you're doing as demonstrated by the invalid block generated a few days ago
@_date: 2017-02-28 20:29:41
nah you're probably seeing it on another Amazon reseller page
@_date: 2017-02-14 21:07:14
Ledger Blue makes sense if you want/need a larger (touch) screen and Bluetooth support - otherwise the Nano S likely makes more sense for you.
@_date: 2016-03-03 07:19:48
welcome back to !
@_date: 2014-11-20 22:01:39
nope. Can't be on that device - we could open the firmware we wrote but that wouldn't make any sense as the chip vendor APIs or the toolchain are only avaialble under very strict NDAs, so nobody would be able to use it for anything meaningful.
We plan to do better, in surprising ways, with our next devices.
@_date: 2016-03-21 15:13:58
The first hotfix has been deployed, should stay up now.
@_date: 2016-01-26 20:02:25
and Ledger will be following soon with hardware support for it :)
@_date: 2016-03-31 07:09:36
yes, I mean when you want to use it, it's trivial for malware to steal the funds right under your nose. This is what hardware wallets are supposed to prevent in the first place, so it'd be nice to find a new name for that device.
@_date: 2016-03-20 21:00:49
this works with all USB hardware wallets I know today, considering they expose an HID interface which works well on Android when USB host is supported - but sometimes it isn't, notoriously for iPhone, which is where BLE gets useful. It's the only transport method that works over all smartphones (not considering going back &amp; forth with QR codes)

thanks. Could you send your logs (when nothing is displayed) to support ? It might just be hitting a node which is currently down but that seems a little bit too constant.

I think on a user experience point of view the best option is likely to provide an indication of whether RBF transactions are accepted or not through a Payment Protocol (BIP 70) extension - that way the problem won't even happen (plus all the benefits of BIP 70 including end to end validation of the destination address which is harder to achieve otherwise)
@_date: 2016-03-25 05:40:44
beat it is probably more like it - not sure it's better though

what happens on the test site when you hit register ? Is there an Authenticator window popping up asking you to tap the card ?
@_date: 2016-01-11 16:34:49
I can answer for Ledger. 


it didn't work properly in the latest firmware and it's complicated enough to fix


it's scheduled with a low priority - the Chrome app is intended to be easy to use and most people are confortable with a 4 digit PIN similar to the one they have on any other smartcard chip (SIM card, EMV card ...)


same as above 


same as above (that old initialization process was a major show stopper for most users in our tests, as people didn't understand how it worked and couldn't go past the initialization phase)
@_date: 2015-01-28 13:39:33
Oh btw, this is weird too - didn't run it on a development board to see how the canary ends up being initialized but I don't have a very good feeling about it -

that's about a good high level summary of the TEE when using a phone, and we run on top of that. The kernel itself is provided by the TEE issuer (Trustonic in that case)

yeah, it's a bit faulty on Windows but should work well on Linux and Mac. 
And the good thing is that the choice is yours : if you want multisig, you can have it. Otherwise you can pick a plain regular wallet. You decide.

Re. BitGo they described [the safeguards they'll use](
@_date: 2016-03-28 14:34:35
uh, yeah, just saw that, pretty bad timing for us.
@_date: 2016-03-03 17:50:47
yes, we have the source on github  and some general instructions on our FAQ  - buying the Starter is only a convenience option, it's not mandatory at all.
@_date: 2016-01-18 15:35:20
we covered that point in our FAQ : 
that being said, the safe thing to do is to wait until there's a single branch left to spend your coins again - if both forks survive for some time and you want to game that, you can but at your own risks. We don't have plans to support that scenario in the Chrome application, but of course you can always use a compatible wallet that'd allow it, or a non compatible one after recovering your HD seed.
@_date: 2015-05-25 20:20:04
you're probably confusing me with someone else, not to mention that's pretty much off topic

Also Mycelium support is coming soon
@_date: 2016-03-03 07:10:58
you can code applications on the hardware wallet itself then use whatever you want to access it from your client applications - typically FIDO protocol over HID or PCSC for USB, regular 14443A APDUs over NFC, FIDO protocol over BLE.
The I/O API is flexible enough to let you do whatever you want (for example mass storage + keyboard + generic HID over USB ? why not)
Login capabilites will initially be added through standard protocols from the FIDO Alliance (starting with U2F over USB/NFC/BLE and adding UAF soon)

is it a recent Samsung by any chance ?

you can download an iPhone or Android application to get a better second factor that let you fully review the transaction, yes
@_date: 2016-03-04 15:42:19
would do the same I guess. The best way would be to test from a different wallet, as my life is too short to track bugs I cannot reproduce 1:1
@_date: 2016-03-20 18:30:27
it's related to the same issue. A partial synchronization could corrupt the database, making it necessary to reset. That one is already fixed though, we just need to work around the server load now.
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:37:25
that's good to know, which site did you use to figure this out ? That's not what estimateFee or 21 are reporting.
@_date: 2016-01-24 23:18:54
1/ no because it's not possible to associate the amount of bitcoin transferred to their current value for the card. Since there have been multiple requests for this I might add an option to make it configurable though
2/ no, no risk in doing that
@_date: 2015-01-31 22:21:37
yep. it's the same firmware, so that helps :) also you'll be able to get discounts for our next wallets when purchasing either a HW.1 or a Ledger Wallet

It doesn't support Satoshilabs keys - i.e., it'll appear as untrusted firmware (after you modify it to append their own header magic, which is different)

yes, it's described more clearly in the new specification - here's the [high level description](

putting the signatures in a different location is a first step - in the future, more compact signatures can be used.
@_date: 2016-01-24 13:23:27
yes absolutely. This is solved with community support, test cases and coverage report - other suggested solutions should do the same.
@_date: 2016-01-19 03:45:55
it's already supported on USB for Google and Dropbox so they're likely to follow with NFC soon (probably one month or so) - also it's very easy to integrate, there are multiple examples on the github link.

Development should not be driven by ultimatums, even more when the terms are unclear (what qualifies as a full block when you're the one picking the transactions ? also over which period of time are you estimating the blocks are full ? and so on)

don't worry about that, Segwit is just around the corner.
@_date: 2016-03-20 11:34:34
If you're looking for open hardware, I'd say that it's complicated and expensive to build a fully open phone, especially regarding the different radios. Typically that's doable for Wifi (see [Novena]( but get more tricky for the baseband. 2G implementations on old chipsets are barely working (see [OsmocomBB]( or [OpenMoko]( - not to mention that the end result would probably be a power management nightmare, since the recent trend is to integrate everything into highly proprietary SoCs.
If you're looking for open software, it should be easier - Fairphone made [some announcements]( and you can use several open Android ROMs (look for the AOSP ROMs). 
Also we picked a somewhat different approach to achieve something similar with [Ledger Blue]( building a device that can connect to all phones and be fully open if you disable its Secure Element - more details soon as we release the developer edition at the end of the month.
@_date: 2016-03-11 10:26:10

that usually means that you should retry after moving slightly the card around or putting it on a table and the phone on top of it depending on its configuration. If it doesn't work you should contact support at support for more investigation.
@_date: 2016-03-20 16:09:58
The other issue being that the client wallet application doesn't clearly state that the server is down when this happens - we're also working on this to make it less stressful in the future.
@_date: 2016-01-19 05:53:40
you need to have [Google Authenticator]( installed, and the [Ledger U2F applet]( loaded on the card through the [Fidesmo]( application. Is that ok ?
@_date: 2016-01-08 01:02:01
agreed on that and we (Ledger) are actually attending CES to bridge the gap between cyber security and consumer oriented products. I think bitcoin is a great opportunity to demonstrate that proper privacy/security hardware should be a consumer concern.

I did a 20 minutes review of the supposed by then finalized FT specifications one-two months ago, found out that it was basically non consistent with itself (mentioning fields with different names / properties depending on the document or page number, not mentioning optional fields and other pretty basic features you'd require in an interoperable protocol), also spotted a consensus critical bug in the implementation that demonstrates a lack of understanding of basic C programming and of any code review.
Do I consider this thing as an alternative to SegWit ? Not by any kind of metric. 
@_date: 2016-03-23 17:47:18
I believe it should take someone experienced with the firmware about one/two days and someone not experienced about one week after browsing through [my post]( and [associated code](
@_date: 2016-03-06 12:03:36
can you post your transaction details ? It'd be interesting to see the fee (we performed some changes to our backend on our side as well).
also we plan to support CPFP soon, which would make those issues less annoying

BitMEX had some integration that might do what you want : 
@_date: 2016-03-27 08:15:26
Thanks ! Actually there is one smartwatch supporting a Trustonic TEE, but without Trusted UI : the Exynos + Android variant of the Galaxy Gear (SM-V700) - we don't have a specific design in mind with those form factors, but plan to license our technology on different secure chips in the near future, so you never know.
@_date: 2015-05-11 09:57:48
sorry, too slow boss.
@_date: 2016-03-20 18:58:24
it's a good idea but hard to audit for the time being. Only the i.MX series provide a fully open Secure Boot specification and they are not really suitable for mobile phones. And the manufacturer or the OS provider usually like to lock that area and rent space on it since it's a nice new revenue opportunity, similar to the former SIM card applications business model.
@_date: 2016-03-01 06:15:28
I have no idea, you should forward logs (adb logcat) to support - never run into that issue before

that includes Bitcoin (at least the sane version of it)
@_date: 2016-03-30 21:14:53
My main concern with that design is that it doesn't sign on device - so it basically makes sure to transfer a private key from point A to point B, and then anything can grab it, typically before it's used by the legitimate user.

Mycelium support is coming too.
@_date: 2015-05-07 02:32:14

getting where exactly ? to the moon ? what about taking more decentralized mining, lower difficulty (it's fine after all as long as the network is not practical to attack), more efficient hashing into account, even supposing that the protocol will never change, which is also quite far fetched in my opinion ?


You can troll better than that.


which is good for me if it leads to the development of better, more efficient hashing devices.


which is also good for me if it makes people create better, more efficient regulatory processes


Could it be that they believe it could spark innovations in multiple fields and they're interested to explore several aspects of it rather than focusing on the price / difficulty feedback loop ?
@_date: 2017-03-14 07:58:40
Well, no. No incentive for mining pools not to grow too much either, just not to make it too obvious.
@_date: 2017-03-05 06:45:00


not if you define it as an incompatible change of consensus rules, and none of those updates was controversial


With soft forks and/or clarifications of the consensus rules performed in a non controversial environment.

oh ok. Did it work ?
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:41:20
Hardware wallets can't enforce which chain the client wallet is transacting on, so what matters is always the client wallet policy.

As of today, with Trustonic :
With the Trusted UI (current integration done today) : 
* All Galaxy S6 models &amp; sub models
* All Galaxy Note 5 models
* Galaxy Note 4 with Exynos CPU only (SM-N910C and SM-N910H models)
* Likely all future Samsung products, but you never know
Without the Trusted UI (will require a server or a second factor to avoid malware using the Trusted Application as a signing oracle, integration not done yet, but ready to be used for developers)
* Most Samsung phones from the Galaxy S3, but not all of them either
* Other recent phones from other manufacturers, but not many ... (under NDA, so, well)
[Our application]( does extensive checks (is the TEE present, is it from Trustonic, can the TEE be accessed, can someone load an application inside the TEE ...) before allowing the user to purchase, so installing it is the best way to verify if your phone is supported (with or without Trusted UI)
In the future we can hope that those applications will be portable across several TEE providers. We're definitely not there yet, but I'll try to help by pushing for Open Source integration.

That paper on threshold signatures was interesting  and regarding Schnorr signatures you have additional data on the [Elements project]( 
@_date: 2017-03-30 17:28:02
yes, I meant Segwit makes hardware wallets faster, not more secure. They're already as secure as they can get without Segwit, and I also believe that Bitcoin works quite well as it is today. If anything, we just need better fee estimation logic.
@_date: 2017-03-22 12:37:52
No, the PIN and the mnemonic phrase are not related - the mnemonic phrase defines all keys derived by the device, the PIN is an additional protection per device.
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:42:52
We provided an early FAQ over there : 
The not such TLDR is that it's complicated, as Bitcoin is not really designed to fork. Our official advice is to hodl during the storm, but of course, if a MAD scenario plays out (such as miners vs early adapters), it won't help much if you care more about the value of the crypto tokens than the crypto tokens themselves.
So take a moment to consider your investment, remember that all crypto currencies are a big ongoing experiment, and act responsibly - we'll do our best to provide you the tools to manage your assets the way you want, but it's ultimately your decision.
@_date: 2017-03-30 17:02:29
Faster rather than more secure though.

Nothing. See [above](
@_date: 2016-01-25 11:16:08


it doesn't really work either. We run a very tiny exchange and I've seen first hand that there's a very healthy dark market for pictures of people holding a piece of paper in front of a webcam, and people that are pretty good at shopping (also some hilariously bad). A motivated attacker can also just hire people and make them click. If the system can be gamed and the outcome is worth it, it will be gamed - this is why e-voting is considered as a bad idea by the security community.

if you're high profile enough, get several from different sources. If the devices are all similar, blank and initialized on your side, that should solve it.


Many of those devices won't have any kind of persistent clock, so that should also solve it.

that's also probably why Bitcoin wasn't created by a company
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:14:21


well we're witnessing a direct proof that Divergent Consensus (the art of hard forking randomly with no fixed activation criteria) is breaking SPV wallets
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:06:27
it's not supported - you can use Electrum for this feature.
@_date: 2017-03-17 22:27:00
for the fee or the amount ? on screen or on device ?
@_date: 2016-01-25 12:51:05
It's a higher risk (against physical attacks) for people losing their devices then. Also passwords are less convenient to revoke than just sending Bitcoins around if the device is lost (website can be down) so this would have been a good opportunity to make passphrases mandatory IMHO.
FWIW the [Mooltipass]( uses a (somewhat outdated but still better than nothing) Secure Element to solve this problem.
@_date: 2017-03-01 04:47:46
the github readme provides a longer summary :)
@_date: 2017-03-09 18:42:03
We updated our FAQ entry re. forks if that helps : 
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:34:40
Actually accepting hard forks with different consensus rules and no activation criteria (and parties encouraging attacks on the already broken signaling process) makes it quite easy to lose assets while the chains keep reorganizing
@_date: 2016-01-31 21:31:23
shorter TL;DR : they bought a Safenet HSM, which happens to have been bought by Gemalto previously.
@_date: 2016-01-13 14:00:53
That's not a bitcoin problem, that's an avoiding being caught doing something illegal problem - which might work for some time until it doesn't. Bitcoin might help playing the cat and mouse game a bit longer but also makes it more risky considering you can easily end up storing a proof of your illegal actions available forever waiting for someone to link it to you at any point in time.
@_date: 2016-01-13 15:52:27
They're only doing that to "open a discussion" (and are already aware that it [will fail (french link)](
An "amendement d'appel" is a tool specifically designed for that.
@_date: 2016-03-07 12:50:27
you can see that the quote or the question was biased when one line refers to a "compromise" and the next refers to a "roadmap".

You want to read the satoshis/byte value, not the $ amount. Here 122 satoshis/byte is lower priority, considering that the recommended value is currently 200.
@_date: 2016-03-31 08:55:43
Thanks, but if you did 2. well you just designed a hardware wallet so it kind of defeats the initial purpose :) 
A better method could be to interact with hardware wallets and safely transfer the private key, similar to [Othercoin]( achieving end to end security. 
I'd like to help buidling an ecosystem around that idea for sure.
@_date: 2019-03-12 08:14:44
Apparently since you thought it was necessary to comment on a payment provider you could avoid ?
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:59:02
that's why it'd be a great plan to get rid of two bad ideas at once :)
@_date: 2017-03-19 14:19:45
yes, you can use any OTG adapter
@_date: 2016-03-14 13:29:13
yeah, not its best angle
@_date: 2016-03-20 15:56:17


I don't think so 


That's more likely, but they probably don't have all specifications either


They consider that some parts don't have to be opened for developers to use them - usually for different reasons. Baseband manufacturers don't open their firmwares because the GSM networks are extremely brittle and having people fuzzing left and right wouldn't be pretty to watch, other radio manufacturers don't open their firmwares because they got them certified for some magic tuning parameters, chinese SoC manufacturers won't release all specifications because they probably don't even remember who copied that IP first, and so on ... 
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:37:28
Complain to people pushing for a hardfork. The SPV wallets were there before they arrived.
@_date: 2017-03-23 17:54:58
no it's one of our distributors who reused our design and forgot to change that. He's fixing this.
@_date: 2016-03-29 19:27:12
Probably a misunderstanding here. We support it so much we published an [article]( about it, and have a [beta firmware]( available for developers to [play with it]( right now.
EDIT : yep, everybody can make mistakes. Have an upvote :)
@_date: 2016-01-29 04:30:42


Satoshi is that you ?
@_date: 2017-03-23 22:44:59
you can achieve that with all of them with Electrum
@_date: 2016-01-19 14:52:52
why do we stop here ? what are they supposed to do if 3 different teams come up with the same idea and different deployment rules ?
@_date: 2017-03-06 06:36:30

You're interested about [attestation]( [sharing your apps]( with other people : get a Nano S
You support building security products on Open MCUs ? Buy a TREZOR to support the team that created it then [build one yourself]( for the actual security benefits of using an Open MCU
Bitcoin is over $1000 and you hodled ? Do all three options :)
@_date: 2016-01-10 15:30:27
We (Ledger) will be working on it soon - the changes to support SegWit are quite limited so I expect every hardware wallet to be compatible with it quickly.
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:04:34
hard drive space is probably the less relevant metric in the scaling debate

you need to personalize the card using our Ledger Wallet application, then tap the card before opening Greenbits - Android will prompt you to open Greenbits then it should work.

Feel free to write support for them, it's an open platform.
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:59:03
it's not about cooperation - if a party is willing to push for changes that randomly break things left and right they have to think a bit more about it and stop doing that or live with the consequences
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:21:50


because Core wants to scale safely and BU wants to get rid of Core. That's kind of hard to combine. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 00:36:14
To help finding buggy code, you use [tests]( - people can verify them, and write more if they're not satisfied with the coverage
@_date: 2016-01-13 13:51:31
It is supported by many popular wallets and used by large payment processors, so you probably ended up using it transparently at some point, and therefore it's important to report and fix its security bugs.
@_date: 2016-03-07 13:07:14


I don't have to try too hard - I expect people prompted to give their opinion on something complex out of the blue to act like this.
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:08:16
That's too bad. Flexible Transaction would have been great as an anti replay mechanism and it's already implemented.
@_date: 2016-01-19 14:26:52
yes, that's totally right. This implies fixing things within Core, not fixing things within every new fork that can pop up
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:10:55
Actually we're using it just fine :)
@_date: 2017-03-03 04:05:58
Electrum should let you create a CPFP transaction - also you don't need to compromise your seed to create a new transaction yourself, you can give our new JS API a try - see 
@_date: 2016-01-21 13:29:55
Whatever the outcome is, I think this clearly demonstrated that there's a need for more communication to the user base from all clients.
@_date: 2016-01-12 06:56:56
Nano and HW.1 are based on the same hardware. Nano is a bit more fancy, so it depends which one you like most.
Multisig is a method to split your keys control between different devices or holders. It acts like an additional safeguard if you're worried about one of the device getting compromised or if you want some elaborate release policy for your funds.
@_date: 2015-05-12 16:18:51
I'll give a better look at the hardware at some point - could be interesting to share a common command set among devices.
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:35:42
well not exactly the same thing, I'd say that we're doing an exercise on lean hardware here, on pretty much every side.
@_date: 2015-05-06 14:12:23
That's a merge of my old HW.1 shopping site (buy.hardwarewallet.com) with the Ledger one - main changes : you can now pay with a credit card (useful if you're not into bitcoins yet), and purchase multiple units. You also get a printed security card (to bootstrap your phone second factor) and instructions.
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:42:54


sure, only BU wants to get rid of Core though. 


you mean after the network ceases to exist ?
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:09:08
It's a good idea to update to 1.3+ because you won't need to restore again for future updates - just make sure to have your mnemonic phrase available before that one.
@_date: 2016-01-19 00:36:33
it'll be simple enough to support. I can even submit a PR if necessary.
@_date: 2016-01-16 15:06:28


I believe that they have been convinced that increasing right now to 2 Mb is a faster option than SegWit because SegWit needs to be implemented by the wallets to be effective as a scaling solution, and they seem to care about deployment speed first which can be understandable for a company in a not so healthy Bitcoin ecosystem right now (low price and not the expected stellar growth).
The right way to change that in my opinion is for everyone involved to spare some development cycles to make sure that SegWit gets deployed in most wallets quickly.
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:24:38
[NW.js]( can run Chrome apps natively - already tested with our own (complex) apps, it just works.

Most if not all the cryptocurrency applications are designed by third parties. You can review the Ledger Live desktop priorities on github. 
@_date: 2016-03-18 22:18:00
considering the first one is abandoned and the second one doesn't exist, I think the insightful question remains - what would be the best sub to post this ?
@_date: 2016-03-31 04:47:30
M of N multisignatures can basically fit in the same space as a single signature using Schnorr or another threshold scheme - also see  for more Segwit benefits
@_date: 2016-01-19 06:53:45


Core has a busy roadmap already, on top of everything else you think they should explain to people that decided to fork how to do it without blowing things up ?
@_date: 2017-03-05 07:36:43
Their new sub is better
@_date: 2019-03-08 09:50:16
No, it's not, as you would be able to check it on the host
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:19:39
No, if you want to do that you'll have to transfer your funds.
@_date: 2016-03-21 00:36:50
yes, it should be back to a usable state tomorrow (so between 5 hours - 10 hours from now) and properly fixed over the next couple days.
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:38:05
They're basically signaling 1 Mb forever using BU, so either the blackmail attempt didn't work very well or someone got trolled hard
@_date: 2017-03-24 09:56:48
hopefully more people will ask themselves the question and realize that's why Bitcoin was not designed to hard fork, even less in a contentious way
@_date: 2017-02-20 07:56:13
It does allow a PIN - right when you set it up as far as I remember
@_date: 2017-03-01 01:52:37
we're working on a password manager application with an interesting design (no host application needed, the device types the password as a keyboard so it should even work on iPhones), available as an alpha for developers on  and soon available to test on Ledger Manager

Our policy regarding hard forks has been detailed here :

it's ok, democracy can solve any issue /s
@_date: 2015-05-29 08:51:07


that very much depends of the implementation and its certification


only if you can't audit it (which also depends of the implementation), at least it guarantees you that no other application/malware is modifying it behind your back when it's processed
@_date: 2015-05-05 00:14:11
from what I understood it works like Whispernet 
@_date: 2019-03-08 09:51:07
Not sure what's "this" in the context of my previous reply explaining our architecture
@_date: 2019-03-12 11:09:54
The main takeaway of this presentation is to **strongly suggest** that you use a passphrase if you worry about physical attacks and rely on a chip that's not designed to hold secrets - those chips are getting easier to attack, we don't know where the tipping point is where everybody will be able to do it quickly and cheaply, but it's definitely evolving fast in the wrong (depending where you stand) direction.

@_date: 2015-05-05 00:00:45
Also with TREZOR you keep control of everything and are free to restore your funds without a third party, or with a third party, depending on the service you picked. Keeping hardware wallets clearly separated from the service using them is important in my opinion, both for interoperability and privacy purposes
@_date: 2015-05-21 16:19:53
no to all three so far - haven't got the opportunity to touch Electrum in a while.
@_date: 2016-03-25 16:34:21
Both designs are rather similar in my opinion. Our ST23YT66 does the elliptic curve cryptography and the random number generation in a blackbox, your ATAES132A does the AES cryptography and the random number generation in a blackbox. 
If one or the other blackbox fails, the whole design is compromised. One notable difference is that the ST23YT66 has an EAL5+ Common Criteria certification and a proven track record in credit cards and passports impementations.
Our design also survives well on a keychain, in a glass of water, under a car ... 
@_date: 2016-03-21 00:46:53
Thanks to you for being patient - I thought the previous fix would hodl, but apparently we got another peak that killed it.

Not on the design part. Satoshi announced the protocol when it was ready, and the result would likely have been very different if it had been crowd designed.
@_date: 2019-03-12 11:00:38
Did you validate the design of your CPU ?
@_date: 2017-03-25 08:53:23


I'd call that a feature
@_date: 2016-01-16 14:30:02
right now QT code frozen at some point in time plus 2 MB max block size. New technical features to be chosen democratically - so maybe it'll move to 4, maybe to 8, maybe statically, maybe dynamically, the crowd has not decided just yet.

It can also be downloaded for people who are comfortable with burning it themselves.
@_date: 2019-03-08 07:07:16
All applications are Open Source, and you can check that the non Open Source components behave as they do by testing it as a black box yourself. For more information about Ledger architecture you can check  For more information about why we picked this design I'd suggest catching our upcoming security presentations (first one coming at  on Sunday)

This vulnerability could allow an attacker that installed malware on your computer to change the transaction destination address so it's recommended to install the latest BTC application on firmware version 1.4.2 or to update to firmware version 1.5 before transacting
@_date: 2019-03-12 07:48:07
That's an idiotic comparison
@_date: 2019-03-01 15:45:41
The exploit only applies to BTC and all other cryptocurrencies built on top of the BTC - in your list only Litecoin would be at risk
@_date: 2019-11-12 06:49:24
Last time I checked Ledger was the only manufacturer to release sales numbers
@_date: 2017-03-11 12:18:08
If you miss a transaction, it can be a temporary synchronization issue - you can close / open the application again to force a refresh, and if it doesn't appear after a while you can also delete the application storage data to force a full resynchronization
@_date: 2017-03-16 04:53:44


I'm not sure whether "idea" or "powerful" is the biggest overstatement here
there are multiple proofs that it's an extremely minor and uninteresting glitch : no interest from developers, no price swings whether it grows or explodes in place ...
@_date: 2019-03-12 07:37:37
That's unrelated to the product
@_date: 2016-01-15 14:28:41
my crystal ball believes it's more likely to be Cryptsy crash (at least that's what happened in the past, and Mike likely sold a long time ago)

Let's see what happens in 2 weeks (tm) just to be sure
@_date: 2017-03-14 07:19:28


That's exactly what's happening when the main ASIC manufacturer is forcing changes into the protocol, right ? 


that's not "a little more on the bandwidth of nodes" - when the blocks get large enough (and they will, since there's no incentive to prevent against that), centralized miners get an unfair competitive advantage built in forever.
@_date: 2019-03-08 10:17:42
We have many conflicting priorities and a small team on Ledger Live desktop
@_date: 2019-11-02 18:32:51
Coldcard doesn't run code in what they call a "secure element", so the Open Source point is kind of moot to evaluate the security of the product.
@_date: 2014-12-02 00:08:55
Yes, and we offer a tutorial for that 
@_date: 2016-01-10 22:56:03
in that given setup both the computer to which the Ledger device is connected and the smartphone would have to be infected by a dedicated malware that still has a communication channel open to both when the user confirmation is sent.
I'm not claiming that this is perfect, just that it lowers the risk significantly - having a screen is not perfect either, it typically won't protect you if you're paying to an address you have never seen before. Every solution has to compromise at some point.
@_date: 2017-03-12 21:37:04
You can usually choose whether to update or not - typically here MyEtherWallet integration was added in the ETH application associated to firmware 1.2 (we're currently on 1.3.1). It'd also be possible for a developer to rebuild the ETH application for lower firmware versions.
@_date: 2016-01-16 19:02:16


Apparently the community wants more transaction capacity and the community will get more transaction capacity. Why exactly should the community care about the implementation details, as long as it stays decentralized and permissionless ? 
@_date: 2019-03-13 06:26:39
So you're computing ECDSA signatures with pen and paper ?
@_date: 2016-01-19 14:07:18
then you get a trivial DoS on valuable development time - just create more forks and ask for Core to interact with them all. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 21:26:37
probably was the best Bitcoin show, and we shared the space with Josh from Shirtoshi, because why not (that's how you end up with a booth made of half hardware wallets, half shirts that you could just grab and pay with a QR code left on the other end of the table) 
@_date: 2019-11-24 13:26:54
No, just that he likely decided to update when prompted by Ledger Live
@_date: 2016-01-04 10:16:38
They're running the generic firmware in [developer mode]( - so it provides key protection, but not transaction validation. Still a great way forward and significantly cheaper than the cheapest HSM.
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:50:18
If your transaction had some change, you can use the new Child Pay For Parent feature of the update we released today to speed up the transaction - do you see this as an option ?
@_date: 2019-11-24 12:24:48
You don't need to enter the mnemonic again when you update since firmware 1.3.1, released in February 2017. Also you don't need to update to keep using the device.

Yes, we're working on it but don't have an ETA to share. In the meantime Electrum is a great option, as mentioned in other posts.
@_date: 2019-03-08 07:14:50
And that's very useful too, for sure. But unfortunately not for this bounty.
@_date: 2016-06-29 15:50:20


so to sum it up, you moved your coins from a wallet using the best possible security on a secure platform to a wallet running cryptographic code in Javascript, for a non issue regarding an optional proposal which is not yet implemented.
You might want to rethink that a bit.
@_date: 2019-11-04 05:38:40
the only thing you need to fall into that threat model is to own a device and not keep track of its whereabouts for a few minutes ... the extraction method will get less complex as soon as there's enough value to extract by using it, or maybe it already is. Think about console modchips, but more portable.
Regarding UX, it's in the eye of the beholder I guess. The touchscreen on the T is too small for me to enter the pin.

It works for what it's intended for. What you're linking to is not related to an issue of the SE.
@_date: 2016-06-05 04:27:35
no, we've several methods to prevent against that, without having to trust us. 
you can confirm transactions using a printed card to check the address
you can confirm transactions on a second computer (having the device type back the transaction details)
you can confirm the transaction over an encrypted channel with an (open source) phone application making it necessary for a hacker to maintain control over the computer and the phone simultaneously when the transaction is performed
moreover we've been over that for almost 4 years now so I'm kind of baffled to see this popping up again in 2016 from someone with significant involvment in the community.

yeah it just means it's a troll
@_date: 2017-03-15 07:05:47
Yesterday crashes showed how manufactured the whole BTU movement is - no rational actor would keep running this code after those events. Bugs can happen, but we're talking about extreme sloppiness regarding what's put in production here. It's somehow hilarious and very bullish for decentralization to think that investing that much money and resources can only buy you *that*
@_date: 2017-03-01 05:47:34
the temporary passphrase let you derive the main BIP 39 seed for the current session (until the device is powered down or locked following a timeout). The persistent option links this passphrase to a PIN - in that case entering this PIN instead of the main one will derive keys according to this additional passphrase

yes that's serious, and no it's not that long - the keyboard is split between uppercase / lowercase / numbers / symbols. Also if you associate a passphrase to a PIN you just need to do it once
@_date: 2016-06-16 16:36:34


You can review the application code - it's available on 


you can test it against the [public specification]( verifying that no additional commands are supported, and that deterministic parts are really deterministic, preventing covert channels.


you can also check how it was generated depending on your client.




You can verify the above up to a given level. 
At some point unfortunately, as hardware is involved, you have to trust something (either the chip vendor, or the supply chain, or ...) - we try to provide a wide number of mechanisms and use secure chips to reduce the scope of what you need to trust.
@_date: 2016-06-16 15:07:00
yeah, that's the only logical conclusion that can be reached when we announce new products. Mmh wait.

Breadwallet uses the platform keyring to store keys, [libsecp256k1]( to perform signatures, thus protecting you against malware and [passive attacks
Copay is based on a cross platform portable design and doesn't use any platform specific mechanism to protect keys or the signing operation itself - everything is done [in Javascript](
There are very valid reasons to choose Copay - for example, if you want to sign using multiple parties, which makes attacks harder as the key material is split, but choosing it because you're pissed off isn't the best idea IMHO.

yes, moral of the story is that ultimately you have to trust somebody when hardware is involved, for the time being. Who you have to trust depends on the architecture you picked.
@_date: 2016-06-21 04:31:44
perfect then, Jaxx will also likely move to it
@_date: 2016-06-29 15:30:54
Plus a lot to this. I just don't get that witch hunt.
Also the Store And Forward proposal provides an elegant solution to a MITM attack which is solved by BIP 70 today as a merchant only solution. BIP 75 let you transact from user to user with the same security.

It can definitely support more than 18 apps if you pick them well, which is why it's kind of a silly metric - applications take space, and you can hold as many coins as you want since deleting applications don't delete the keys.

thanks, looks nicely done
@_date: 2016-06-20 23:22:21
ok thanks, that's good to know. In the end it's easy enough to tweak on our side, I just hope that ETH wallets can agree on some interoperable derivation path at some point.
Also even if it makes more sense for ETH, maybe that specific path naming shouldn't be pointing to BIP 44 since it doesn't fully map to its derivation scheme.
@_date: 2019-11-12 10:08:37
The core platform is an old NXP Java Card (JCOP, don't remember the exact version), reasonably secure against physical attacks. I did some reverse engineering on the applet itself but not much, my conclusion was that the platform was lacking cryptographic features to properly validate transactions on the chip itself for Ethereum (resulting in the chip just signing a hash sent by the phone). I have no idea if Bitcoin transactions are properly parsed, but that'd be something to check for interested parties.
@_date: 2016-01-19 02:49:33
As far as I know, most can be upgraded. The changes will be pretty small, and as a result most will work faster since the witness includes the input amount (so the hardware doesn't have to hash the previous transaction, which can take time if it's large).
I'll start working on ours (Ledger) likely next week during TNABC Hackathon, and will be able to post Pull Requests to other Open Source hardware wallets (TREZOR, KeepKey) if necessary.
@_date: 2016-01-28 23:59:28
No, because that works for generic projects, not for R&amp;D. And even then very few companies would have started an R&amp;D effort on the Byzantine Generals problem for fun, and probably none would have done that to create and give away a decentralized system.

thanks, and we have many new applications coming up :)
@_date: 2018-10-16 16:18:50
Having a monolithic firmware is a risk in itself (especially when running on a chip that's not designed for security purposes). Regarding the Blue, you can contact support to exchange it for a retail one - we never got to backport the firmware on the developer edition as the hardware ended up being different
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:39:58
The display of the regular Nano is delegated to your phone. A malware would have to infect both the host, your phone, and synchronize both to display something consistant.

A hardware wallet is not as interesting to infiltrate as a general purpose computer - it's not always connected, and only performs a limited set of functionalities. If an attacker wants to compromise a hardware wallet, it's more effective to create a fake one. Ledger mitigates against this with a remote authentication and a way for the user to validate the PCB, as described in 
@_date: 2017-01-26 15:06:37
not only that, they're also the only way to guarantee that your distribution model can scale. Try producing a general purpose security device from China and see what happens

You can use this feature if someone requested a proof of ownership of an address - typically you sign a unique message and a timestamp with your private key, then provide the signed message that the third party can use to find out your address and that you really owned the associated private key.

well you need to see it the other way around - when an update is mandatory, it's usually a security update, and not applying it is a major security risk. The alternative is believing that all software is bug free, which is not going to happen.

yes, you need to trust the hardware wallet manufacturer, the silicon vendor, and when not using dedicated secure hardware also everybody touching the chip (which can be quite unpractical when you scale your production).
that's an issue with everything hardware produced today - there are a few projects trying to create more open hardware, but it's a tough place to be business wise so I guess nothing will change in the near future.

* the Ledger Manager extension is used to update the firmware of the device or load/delete applications
* the Bitcoin Wallet extension is used to manage Bitcoin and all Bitcoin/Peercoin alts, including Dash, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Stratis, Zcash with the coin specific application opened on device
* the Ethereum extension is used to manage Ethereum
@_date: 2016-06-23 05:01:36
For the sake of being precise, note that a TEE (an enclave, to generalize) is not a Secure Element.
A Secure Element is an independant physical chip providing protection against physical attacks.
An enclave relies on exisiting general purpose hardware to provide protection against software attacks even if the Operating System is compromised and malware escalates to top level (kernel mode) permissions - it is not designed to protect against physical attacks though.
@_date: 2016-06-20 14:47:37
Same platform as the Blue, we're using the ST31 for both.

@_date: 2017-01-22 14:44:22
Same output, you mean the same address but a different utxo right ? In that case that could point to a weak key or a nonce reuse but I don't think this has been reported for Electrum anytime so that also sounds very unlikely unless your setup fully breaks the system entropy somehow
@_date: 2017-01-09 05:15:51


how do you verify the code running into it and that a unit you received has not been compromised ?
spoilers : you can't and secure hardware distribution is one of the reason why Secure Elements have been created

hey, you still failed to answer my last question about how you'd verify an open source hardware wallet you receive. Maybe you could do that instead of seeming sadly stuck in a loop of misunderstanding ? 
as a remainder, it's that way 
@_date: 2017-01-08 16:00:03
it's a plausible deniability feature - you can use it in case you don't want to reveal to a (physical) third party how many Bitcoins you own, but still make it look like you were using the wallet.
@_date: 2018-10-19 05:47:29


I'd say this is pretty close to my personal view and the opinion of other hardware security people I'm interacting with - 
Can you be more specific about the PUF you're using ?
@_date: 2016-06-21 07:04:26


pretty much, you scroll through the numbers with the up/down keys and validate each digit by pressing both simultaneously


they are but not enabled yet as the stretching still takes about 10 seconds


Seeds are generated by the device on this hardware


It just uses the chip entropy for the time being but that's quite easy to change (we started with that because the Blue can be set up without being connected to anything)


It's only displayed on the device screen


You enter the mnemonic words on device - same than with the PIN. It's a bit painful but still usable as we can suggest auto completion after we get the first 3-4 letters of each word.


they need an update which is basically just changing the USB device ID. It should be published when the device is out.


Yes because the device ID changed


The device seed is wiped after 3 wrong PINs. Since the PIN is entered on device, we don't have that power cycle requirement as a malware cannot wipe the device on its own.


The Secure Element is an [ST31H320]( the generic MCU is an [STM32F042](


Applications are stored on the Secure Element.


The code will be available on  - it will include all high level applications and the STM32 firmware.


The ST31 kernel (bootloader, isolation, implementation of the SDK APIs) is unavailable right now but will be over time as we figure a way to properly isolate the Hardware Abstraction Layer that we cannot release and have something users can build and link against. We described the way forward in a [Medium post]( earlier.
The rough roadmap looks like :
* Provide more code as read-only material (you can compile chunks into the apps, but not verify what's on device)
* Provide an Open Source version of the isolation kernel that can work on a generic MCU with MPU/MMU support
* Provide a version of the above that can be compiled, linked against an encrypted binary blob implementing the NDA-ed parts (mostly related to chip initialization, memory &amp; I/O), loaded and verified on device

preferably the other way round - you'll generate new Elliptic Curve keys based on a derivation from the device seed and use them on your server / keyring. 
the SDK also supports RSA keys, so the applications can be modified to use them, but it's less interesting from a single backup point of view.

I already asked you who/what was flashing that code, are you not understanding my question or just not knowing the answer and not interested to dig into it ?


Are you suggesting that the smartcard industry is an illusion that managed to hide itself for about 40 years now ?


yes, notice the could, and the alternative is using a chip that guarantee that an attacker can succeed and has the same backdoor risk on top of it at the silicon level. Does that really sound like a better choice ?
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:39:11
That's definitely technically doable. We decided not to go for it to avoid touching the Chrome application too much as we're in the middle of a redesign.

Well to be honest I'm fine with the other argument, I'm just not fine with announcing it as a fact, such as "the one thing the miners want" because nobody is entitled to speak for the miners. Given that, maybe arguing the exact opposite will help people understand that well, a lot of arguments are acceptable.
Also thanks for the love :)
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:22:38
Maybe I missed something here, but the bootloader in currently deployed devices will copy the flash information to a fixed location in RAM (meta_backup), which is not related to the version of the firmware currently installed. So how do they interact with each other ?

No wallet will work with it on iPhone as Apple didn't open the USB communication API (the Blue can work with it through BLE though).

Miners have always been regrouping and the bigger the block size the more incentive they have to do so to get a competitive advantage

you also misunderstood the threat model but don't worry I'm here to help driving you through it


No it's not and I suggest you pay more attention to the blog post I linked before you start saying I'm using jargon again. There is no shame in asking questions if you don't understand something - hardware security is complicated and there is no bulletproof solution


so what's the difference between that and not knowing what the chip you receive is running exactly ?

it is completely false and rather insulting. Again don't be afraid to ask questions when you don't understand something rather than jumping to wrong conclusions


It's up to me to educate the people about the tricky things around hardware security though.
@_date: 2019-11-04 04:06:40
Intel has exactly 0% shares in our capital, you seem to be confusing this with the proof of concept on SGX I built. Not that it would be a bad thing though.
Ledger also has a password manager, which works without any client application integration (the device types the password), and your security evaluation seems weird - if 99% of users use a Trezor without a passphrase and the seed can be extracted in a couple minutes when left on a table, it doesn't look very secure to me

there have been other people attacking those chips (likely with less expertise than Chris and with access to less hardware though but still making valid points)
in any case there's still nothing to compare between trying to physically attack one of those chips (even the very old ones) and a generic MCU
@_date: 2018-10-16 17:25:42
The security model allowed the platform to recover from this attack, which is the whole point of the architecture - the MCU is not trusted for a good reason.
@_date: 2017-01-09 06:06:38


explain me how you achieve that.
regarding what I say, sure, that's applicable for all chips holding code you didn't put there yourself. You just have to be aware of the risk and we want to raise that awareness
@_date: 2017-01-27 09:10:28


you have already proven on multiple occasions that you don't understand hardware security and our security model. You don't need to do it further.

Yes, this will automatically take care of application dependencies and updates.
@_date: 2018-10-07 17:02:47
It depends what your threat model is and where you put your convenience/security trade offs. This is usually non trivial and it's very easy to make critical mistakes, especially where you're not used to deal with hardware security.

Read the medium post I linked more carefully.


Again, how do you verify the code running on the chip ?


Not using dedicated hardware to distribute sensitive code and hold secrets assume different additional risks that you still have trouble understanding apparently, but I'm not hopeless

I'm sure you'll be happy with it again once the update completes. The update process is extremely hard to control because we go through several software stacks, some very old and not working that well on Windows.

The Nano/Blue are of course totally different.

@_date: 2017-08-29 08:14:04
I agree with that, initially we weren't supposed to do any changes to the Chrome apps since we're redesigning a native version of the apps (which will merge both types into the same wallet and allow transactions mixing both inputs as intended), but since we had to do some kludge for BCH, I decided to organize it so it'd also be usable for Segwit. Which explains why it's sub optimal but still better than waiting a few months to use Segwit addresses.

This feature will make it possible to allow 2 wallets yes - they'd use the same BIP 39 seed, one with a passphrase you choose (typically for the core wallet), the other without a passphrase (typically for the transaction wallet)
@_date: 2017-01-29 15:22:15
The issues you've been overlooking in this setup are physical attacks (someone steals the phone and mamage to extract data - it will likely be easier on a phone than on a hardware wallet) and drive-by exploits triggered by MMS, SMS or connecting to a specific Wifi network (there have been some occuring in the past, typically related to OEM software not pinning down certificates correctly when updating)
@_date: 2017-01-08 12:29:18
They use Hierarchical Deterministic wallets (following [BIP 32 standard]( and usually [BIP 44]( to derive all generated keys from a seed, usually encoded with mnemonics following the [BIP 39 standard]( - if you lose the wallet, you can just restore the mnemonic seed with any software or hardware wallet implementing it.
@_date: 2017-08-07 13:44:41
The architecture is quite flexible, so you're about right regarding the different steps - it's basically a large hardware wallet that you can set up as you want (the HSM can generate seed that you split, or you can inject different split secrets coming from the device), and add specific validation rules (for example the HSM could be used to verify the accounts integrity in the background by replaying the transactions)

@_date: 2016-06-22 05:05:05
[source : I'm the CTO of Ledger so a notorious Secure Element shill]
The main drawback with this approach is to weight properly the risks if somebody gets physical access to your device. Two attack scenarios can be considered :
In the first one, a software attack against the iPhone/Android enclave is exploited. This is basically a jailbreak/root that doesn't wipe the device and is in my opinion important to consider, especially on a non updated device as enclave technologies are still maturing. All dedicated hardware wallets offer better protection (or at least a smaller attack surface) against this risk.
In the second one, the device itself is physically attacked.This would require more time than the first attack, but is still realistic as enclaves are not designed to offer protection against that. The phone itself will offer some according to how it was designed, but we've seen recently that Apple and the FBI seem to disagree on that point. Whether an iPhone/Android or a dedicated device not performing all cryptographic operations on a secure chip offers more protection against those attacks is opened for debate, but I'd probably vote for the iPhone in that case.
TLDR : store your phone in a secure location and make sure you know how long it'd take for you to get notified if it disappears if you plan to move forward with this method

You can remove it immediately, the transaction happens on the blockchain.

so, between two non auditable devices, one being built on a chip with no protection against rogue modifications, and the other one being built on a chip specifically designed to be protected against that, you'd take the former. This seems weird.

yes, we can delete your account but we have to keep your ID anyway. Again, not our choice, we're not making those stupid regulations. 


that's pretty simple, we send them the documents, they reply "OMG NOES", and we have to block the account or we can't keep working with them (and then we close the business).
again, yes that's pretty annoying (and also a reason why Bitcoin is so great), but if you're running any kind of service exchanging fiat for crypto, you have to deal with that.

why would that equilibrium put censorship resistance in the front seat rather than more profit for all involved actors ?
@_date: 2017-01-29 03:37:50


Well you can't really compare the risk models of a generic MCU and a Secure Element ... especially for the enterprise. The Blue is clearly more enterprise oriented than the Nano S.


yes the large touch screen, multiple radio integrations (BLE, NFC), and the battery make it significantly more expensive than a TREZOR. That's kind of expected. On a similar price range, check the Nano S - which is exactly the same platform security wise without the screen, battery and radios.


I'm a bit puzzled on that one, are we not Czech enough or something ? :(

this is right for the time being - in the future, the hardware wallet will be able to parse whatever protocol guarantees an end to end secure transaction between the sender and the receiver (for example something based on BIP 70). In the meantime, it guarantees that you can verify the amount, an address you enter yourself, and that a malware or a thief will not be able to get all your stash in one run.

if you're talking about the one time PIN, then sure, that's the security model of the original method - it's based on the conclusion that it's notoriously difficult to switch off the power from the USB bus on most implementations.

I feel your pain. I'm so fucking sick of people commenting without reading as well. There is no doubt a healthier community would help Bitcoin, but I don't really see how that'd help with Lightning Network development.


Do you have one ? I have one. It fills up when we fuck up, and we don't blame the Bitcoin network for that. Otherwise things work just fine.


Do you also want users to decide what is technical debt and what isn't ? I guess we would have seen some complaints if developers estimated that 9 months were not enough to implement something.

It depends what you want to do - if you mean using exsiting Point Of Sale terminals without modifying their software or installing a third party app, no. 
Then if you just want to send the payment request (or URI) information over NFC, it'd fairly easy to support for the wallets, but the payment experience wouldn't be super fast : you'd still need to confirm on the wallet then broadcast the transaction over the network.
Another option would be to do the full transaction over NFC, sending back the signed transaction to be broadcast by the terminal, allowing you to pay with Bitcoin even when there's no network connectivity on your phone. This might look more appealing but the user experience would be worse, as NFC is not really designed for long communication sessions.
Yet another option would be to have some specific protocol between the terminal and the handset where private keys dedicated to an account could be exchanged over NFC for faster payment. This would likely be better but requires to trust the terminal and wallet, and splitting funds between this special account and the regular accounts might be annoying for the user. 
TLDR : I don't see a bright future for NFC payments in general and an even more painful one for Bitcoin NFC payments.

Not with a glitching attack. It's just messing up with a simple comparison.


Because it's significantly easier to steal Bitcoins otherwise.

BadUSB was extremely hyped to basically promote a security firm.

Not really if you can't prove which code is running on the device you receive. I'm still waiting for somebody to show me how that would be done without destroying it.


The STM32 security features ("option bytes") are about as proprietary (likely more, since at least implementation details are available under NDAs for Secure Elements), only less tested, and the chip is not designed to withstand physical attacks or hold critical code at all.

Trusted enclaves will be more and more present in the future for all kind of use cases - so far mobile terminals are slightly ahead of the adoption curve.

Yes, it'd be quite easy to implement, typically with an application generating a new key, not linked to the user seed.

Since a few people seem to be interested in the platform security, my couple sats on it from an interested outsider perspective with skin in the security game as Ledger CTO.
It's based on Samsung in house Trusted Execution Environment called TEEGRIS ( - security wise it should be equivalent to the pilot we run in 2015 with Trustonic TEE (Ledger Trustlet) or the Zion platform used on HTC Exodus : it uses hardware and software isolation to protect the wallet application from other Android applications and the Android OS.
The protection offered against regular malware is fine if the TEE + application combination isn't too buggy (which is still to be validated). The protection against software assisted hardware attacks such as the Rowhammer/Spectre/Meltdown &amp; friends is still to be validated. The protection against direct hardware attacks is likely out of scope - the platform has some building blocks to support a new breed of Secure Elements embedded in the application processor (integrated Secure Element) but I don't think it's enabled yet
The TEE itself is closed source but likely not encrypted. You can probably reverse engineer it from the firmware if you're interested. The Wallet application is also closed source but not encrypted. You can reverse engineer it from the Samsung Blockchain Keystore APK.
If you want to buidl on it or fuzz it, there's also an SDK available 
Also it's worth noting that for the time being it's only available in the following regions : Canada, Germany, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, United States of America and the United Kingdom on the following devices : Galaxy S10e, S10, S10+, S10 5G, Note10, and the Note10+

yes, I'd say that if the TEE + app is sound security wise it offers a better protection against malware than other single signature phone wallets which would use a similar architecture to only store the key and arbitrarily sign data, since the business logic of the transaction validation is also enforced by a more secure environment than Android.

@_date: 2016-12-22 16:35:00
Lightning is trustless (well you trust the network, and its behavior), which is why you need some kind of protection against malleability otherwise funds can be moved out the channel by a malicious party without the other party noticing it immediately. Here you trust both parties to behave properly - by validating the running code and being sure that the private keys associated to the channel are tied to this code.

no definitely not, it's just a tough issue that took time to fix. The phone application is definitely the most secure option for HW.1 / Nano confirmation and thanks for working on supporting it for Electrum - this issue has been fixed fully and everything will work smoothly on the next firmware release.
It is unfortunately not possible to release all source code for HW.1 considering that this chip and development environment is way more closed than the one used in the Nano S - but I used an approach that will make it more likely to port the open parts of the code on a U2F zero or a similar design at some point, as a side project - if you look closely at the Bitcoin application source code for the Nano S (available at  you'll see that it's essentially HW.1 with the security card / phone pairing left out for readability. Those parts will be merged back at some point in the side project before the code starts diverging more from HW.1.

My take on that is governments don't really have any incentive to backdoor the chips they're using for their own security (passports, credit cards and such), and that adding a passphrase is not a great user experience - I don't think credit cards would have been successful if users would have had to enter a passphrase before performing a transaction.

I'm not talking about blind trust here - but in any case you're trusting parties blindly if you buy a hardware wallet rather than making your own - just less parties if you buy one using a dedicated chip, even if that looks counterintuitive.

To be honest it was kind of obvious for anybody working with secure hardware. That's the reason why smartcards have been designed in the first place in the 1980s - it's extremely hard to protect against those attacks if they're not considered when the chip is designed (shameless plug for my 2015 talk, still applicable here

You always have to trust a third party unless you're building your own chips. Using a Secure Element guarantees that you're trusting the minimum amount of third parties

yes, that's guaranteed if you use xpubs.

We picked Bitpay in 2014 - at that point they were basically the only game in town. In the meantime we redesigned a lot of things around the e-commerce website and the dependency to Bitpay is quite sticky.  As I mentioned we're looking at alternatives that wouldn't break things too much
@_date: 2019-08-30 08:23:46
I believe there are clear incentives to break cryptocurrency wallets (if only the instant and anonymous financial gain). That's why it's the best stress test for new security architectures such as this one
@_date: 2016-11-13 09:04:19


no, there have been some issues with the fee estimation code as a few miners started advertising too expensive policies - if you ask for an estimation to be included into the next block, you might get that behaviour. This has been discussed in the past few days ( and will likely be easily fixed by just requesting an estimation for a longer delay (which will also succeed earlier than the estimated delay)


I'd say that better UX and estimations and standardization of the workarounds would likely help much more than increasing the block size, given that we can't avoid transaction peaks.


or with a broken network if we picked 8 Mb


given that people arguing the loudest don't code, I wouldn't be too worried about that

Using a passphrase is at best a mitigation. The feature should be mandatory, but is not advertised for pretty good reasons - it's a major user experience hassle. I don't think credit cards would have ever been successful if users had to type a complex passphrase before using them, and you look silly if you explain that you're going to solve the password problem by using a device that needs a more complex password than all passwords you're currently using to be secure.

Coldcard and Bitbox are not using what I'd call a Secure Element - it doesn't run the business logic and is not as strongly protected against physical attacks as what everyone outside of the crypto community agrees to call a Secure Element, basically (i.e. a smartcard chip)
100% open source doesn't mean much, either. Considering Trezor, we've demonstrated that you can easily extract information from the chip if you get physical access to it. That's not something you can verify or audit in the source code, but is an important property to make the product secure nonetheless

@_date: 2015-08-04 19:56:39
~~Two~~ Three things to check : 
- Verify that you have a /dev/mobicore device. It means the TEE did boot
- Verify that you have a /data/app/mcRegistry directory with some files into it. It means the TEE personalization should be available.
- Verify that /system/lib/libtlc_tima_tui.so is present. If not, your TEE doesn't support the Trusted UI and can't be used for the first beta. Probably later.
Then change /dev/mobicore access rights to world writable (chmod 777 /dev/mobicore) and you should be able to download the beta application when it's available.
EDIT : added the Trusted UI service check to avoid people getting disappointed. Also copypastaing the Trusted UI service from one ROM supporting it to another not supporting it won't work.

This is highly debatable depending on your threat model and business model when you're building hardware.

Tomorrow might be different, but we're shipping today.

Because we use multiple proprietary solutions - the Secure Boot Exynos implementation is not Open Source,  Trustonic implementation of the Trusted Execution Environment is not Open Source, and Intercede implementation of the Trustonic proprietary provisioning method is not Open Source either. 
We're still trying hard to work around this to provide code that third parties will be able to audit and tweak without NDAs, but that will not include everything - it'll be very similar to our [Java Card implementation]( on which you can audit and tweak the application, but not the Virtual Machine executing it.

In my opinion, the current fee system works well - low to zero under normal conditions, adjusting dynamically when under stress. The spam attacks demonstrated that not many people implemented the dynamic fees mechanisms and that they are not yet optimal, and could lead to fee race conditions. I believe that several mechanisms will exist to fix that in the near future (e.g. by having the relays enforce minimal fees amount manually) and that a minor temporary annoyance (spam attacks) can be handled without turning it into a major permanent annoyance (forever higher fees or a consensus risk). Ultimately the attackers will run out of money before the relayers run out of patience and the developers out of creativity.

you'll most certainly need this and that was my point - why should they be ok with it ? Connect is pretty much pushed as a TREZOR only feature (so much that losing your device is losing your identity with the current version). So I don't really see it flying outside of the Bitcoin industry, and even that is far fetched considering [Clef]( is lobbying pretty hard in this space already. The outside world is implementing [FIDO]( designed from scratch for [interoperability]( with [great specifications]( an impressive [list of members]( and already supported by [all Google Applications]( and [Dropbox]( right now. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 18:20:24
it supports most models past Galaxy S3 but without a dedicated UI. So it's possible to do something for those, but harder to secure (kind of the Ledger Nano without a screen or buttons). We decided to focus on the 2 phones supporting the Trusted UI right now and offer some options later for the earlier implementations.

Because you only need that piece of paper (or [stronger material]( in case of trouble (lost or broken device) - you can routinely spend your bitcoins without caring about the health of the device you're spending them on the remaining time. 
TLDR : Hardware wallets help you use bitcoin.

Nitpicking for the sake of nitpicking : that's not forced obsolescence. Forced obsolescence is when the manufacturer designs something on purpose to make the product useless before it's expected end of life. In those cases, nothing is decided by the manufacturer.
If you want to start splitting hairs and talk about forced obsolescence in TREZOR, you could consider the fact that the flash is stressed a lot when the PIN is enabled (as the [full storage region]( is erased/rewritten twice) - but that's definitely fixable and more a rookie mistake than forced obsolescence :)
The only breaking changes in my opinion are the introduction of a new algorithm at some point of the process of generating an address or signing a transaction that'd require large amounts of RAM (making it impossible to run) or important algorithmic complexity (making it too slow to run, ruining the user experience).
In my opinion, the likelihood of one or the other happening is low. Extremely low for an algorithm change requiring large amounts of RAM (you usually only end up in that case on purpose - f.e. when designing ASIC resistant hashes), reasonably low for the second one, still developers have to think about things twice when performing low level changes.
Typical corner cases of involuntary complexity today are transactions with a large number of inputs (it takes time to sign each input), or transactions with a large parent transaction (as the amount is not present in previous outputs pointed to transactions, it has to be recomputed by parsing the parent, which takes time if the parent is huge)


today most features of TREZOR are interoperable, so you're good to go, as long as you don't use TREZOR Connect the way it is implemented today. 
For a longer, almost off topic but necessary explanation on that, this is not me arguing with the competition, this is me stating that an identity protocol **[SHALL NOT]( bind you to a single device or implementation. Websites using the off the shelf TREZOR Connect implementation will only work with TREZORs and not offer a fallback method, so if your device fails, and you don't want to get a new one, you lose your identity. Don't accept that.

Forks are fine - a fork designed to diverge on purpose is hostile, but that's also fine for the typical software project - worst case scenario, you lose some users or productivity, best case scenario, you get some additional users who like the new fork. In my opinion that's very different for consensus based software with a large user base - everything should be done to avoid hostile forks because it creates a risky environment for everybody.

so far I haven't updated the specification and the code doesn't include everything yet. 
the initial version will force a user confirmation using the printed card we already have with the Nano for every transaction (so the [common specification]( is enforced, that part is already in github), and the idea from there is to gradually support faster (one tap) payments to pre-authenticated BIP 70 peers with limited funds.

Yes, question is how decentralized / disconnected you want to be - there are several possible options : 
- Work online (from the user side, phone mandatory) and dedicated terminals or another phone - that could be a simple [BIP 70]( extension
- Work offline (from the user side, phone not mandatory) with dedicated terminals or an EMV terminal with a dedicated application or a phone. This would mean having an account in Bitcoin on a card / phone and having the right protocol to spend those bitcoins. There are no real standards for that right now ([BlosTech]( has one proposal), but people should be able to play with it easily with [Ledger Unplugged]( considering it's [Open Source]( and [easy to patch](
- Work with compatible EMV (banking) terminals without changes on the terminal. This can be done through [tokenization]( either from a card or a phone, and basically simulates a virtual banking card, which is attached to a third party. This is as decentralized and open as the third party can be, i.e. not very much today. I assume [OneBit]( is doing that. We (Ledger) would be very interested to work on an open version of that.

good, happy to see you approve our strategy to make those more secure.


that you can't / won't audit in a realistic way. See above points. Would you also claim that an STM32 is a better solution than a dedicated secure chip to protect against physical attacks while you're at it ?


yes, because running in TrustZone is obviously less secure than being vulnerable to every bug of the underlying OS.

No, it's downloaded on demand, encrypted for the device by a third party application. Also closed source, because it uses two NDA-ed APIs, one by Trustonic, one by our provisioning partner Intercede.
This app also exposes the TEE application [as a service]( to avoid contaminating the nice open source wallets with dirty closed APIs :)

yes, fair enough regarding the PIN, and it's a nice way of using the screen - I'm routinely referring to that in non bitcoin circles as an innovative new security method, along with our own [keyboard second factor]( 
Regarding the "no part of it is vulnerable to malware at all", well, you still have an issue if trying to use it on a compromised computer and sending bitcoins to a new address you read on that computer, but that's true for all hardware wallets today, and there is no easy and 100% foolproof way around it. 
Pushing for more adoption of the Payment Protocol (BIP 70) is one way to go, and more options are being developed (such as [Electrum aliases]( or [Netki names]( so it's important to keep this in mind and constantly think about solutions to improve the ecosystem.

The OS / kernel on the Secure Element is closed source for the time being, but we control all parts and are busy opening it - ultimately there'll just be a minimal binary blob left, which just covers what cannot be opened per the vendor NDA.
All appilcations built on top of the OS are open source. 
For more details about our architecture you can check 
I believe this approach - taking a chip design which is quite secure, battle tested and cheap, used by banks / governements, and open it to the general public - will create more value for the community than trying to secure general purpose chips, which is fighting a downhill battle.

there is no contingency plan - if the signing keys are obtained, the system is broken - same as all systems using  symmetric or asymmetric keys to protect resources.

Trustzone works very basically by assigning privilege levels to memory areas and defines a normal world (Android) and a secure world (TEE). When blitting the screen in secure mode, the memory buffer cannot be observed from the normal world. During the initialization the user draws a pattern that is kept encrypted and blitted back on the next operations. By checking it you can verify that the TEE code is running, because the isolation layers would have prevented the normal world from grabbing the user defined pattern.
@_date: 2015-07-27 07:46:02

Wait for our next firmware version you'll be surprised. Oh I guess I can start describing it so people can comment on it
So, we managed to persist data in a secure way between different flashed firmwares. Which means we can keep the user seed as we flash. Which also means we can have 1 firmware for setup and 1 firmware for operation, getting rid of the code size limitation that was one thing preventing us from implementing BIP 39 on the device itself. The other one was SHA 512 speed, which has been improved a lot as well, now we can stretch the mnemonic in 3 minutes 30 seconds, which is acceptable for setup.
So with the next version, the device will mix user and device entropy to generate a "swapped" 24 words BIP 39 mnemonic. Those words will be swapped according to a unique pattern per device, set at factory, printed on the recovery card. You can then also restore securely the same device, or "unswap" those words to restore on a regular BIP 39 wallet.
Existing customers will be able to set that swapping pattern on an airgapped computer (once), which will also let you use this feature if you wish.
It'd of course be better with a screen, that'll be for the next generation device, or the TEE application when run on a device supporting the "Trusted UI" feature. In the meantime, this is as secure as TREZOR restore process, which doesn't seem to irritate people too much, so I hope you'll like it.
We'll keep improving the Nano/HW.1 product line over time because we believe there's definitely a market for sub $5 (with enough volume) commodity Hardware Wallets, and you just can't achieve that with a screen.

Why ? Sorry, I'm not that good at guessing what people could mean over the internet.




The first thing a proper VC would look for is an exit strategy considering bad circumstances before putting money in, especially if the market looks a bit like a gamble. For us well it's clear that there'll still be a market for secure devices enabling more privacy that can be easily audited by the end users. For miners, the experience of creating more efficient (power/task wise) dedicated chips is always salvageable. I'll let you extend that to BlockStream, recheck who invested in, read [their fact sheet]( again and maybe reconsider that putting 21M$ in an imaginary toll road built by people strongly opposing those very ideas might not be the best business decision.
@_date: 2015-08-28 06:45:24

1/ You can verify the device integrity by following 
2/ See 1. Also flashing a device is not enough to make sure it hasn't been tampered with. You need a physical validation (otherwise it's easy to add a chip in the middle, along with other flaws when using a non secure microcontroller)
3/ You can write the words on a regular sheet of paper. It's not necessary to use ours.
4/ The PIN entry is significantly more secure than any other implementation because nothing is enabled on the device until the PIN is entered 
5/ You're supposed to write it down correctly. It's only intended as a quick check. You can also verify that it was entered correctly without compromising it using 
6/ The multi application scheme is critical for the security of the device - it makes sure that a bug in a coin application cannot compromise the whole device. This is how we can add coins very quickly. Also it's useful to segregate coins with similar parameters (typically Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash) and make sure users are not fooled into interacting with the other chain by a malicious service.
7/ You only need to have an application installed when transacting, so the application limit is a minor hassle. Our new application suite will load dynamically the coins you want to use when necessary.

Sorry, I probably missed an edit 


you can't check this on every piece of hardware actually shipped. I mean, if you're going to say that all proprietary software is compromised, it's just fair to use all kind of silly theories myself right ?


I wouldn't hold my breath too much, especially when matching all performance requirements.




mmh, no.
Let's say that a platform protects me against kitchen variety fault injection (clock &amp; voltage glitches). That's quite easy to check - I glitch it, and see how it reacts. I don't need to check anything more to verify that it's working as advertised.
Apply this to all claims of the secure microcontroller, then to the STM32, and come back with your own conclusions.


Oh well they can be tested easily enough once you are familiar with the concepts of ARM Secure Monitor, which are fully documented. That's why we're actually releasing beta software as fast as we can, and that's probably one of the first TEE application available to the general public - we want people to shake it. Believe it or not, I think tests and reverse engineering matter more than grand principles such as "Open Source Good, Proprietary Evil" to assess software security.


You just cannot compare an OS + platform + applications with a hardware isolation layer, it doesn't make any kind of sense.


Pretty much, and you should also do it with open source software, typically when writing constant time code for cryptographic algorithms, because Open Source doesn't make things magically bug free.


Maybe not starting it by calling people you've never been talking to "compromised" or "incompetent" might help as well. 


it only takes away the ability to extend on it, and we're working to fix that. 
it doesn't at all take away the ability to audit it or verify it, it just takes a different set of abilities to be able to do something with it. Check our integration code for [Mycelium]( or [Greenbits]( Check [our specification]( Ask anybody who reverse engineered hardware before. Things are not black or white, especially when dealing with embedded platforms. 
To make myself clear : I'm an extremely strong believer in Open Source. I'm also an extremely strong pragmatic. If I can use an interesting technology, I'll use it, and this convinced me. If it didn't convince you, start reverse engineering it and come back with your results. That's one of the reasons why this open beta was started.

I still believe it works as a low cost payment network - when not stressed, it can almost be free. Even when stressed, the fee to send something scales way better than typical banking fees - with network capacity rather than with the amount you're sending.

The Trusted Execution Environment version is basically a virtualized hardware running in a secure enclave (so no new hardware is involved). The NFC one works by tapping it on the back of the phone, for compatible phones (so mostly Android and recent Windows Phones. Apple might release an update to read ISO 14443 cards at some point, but I wouldn't hold my breath, not even sure that the antenna can support it on current hardware). We'll also have a Bluetooth Low Energy device (end of the year) for iPhone users.

I'm afraid it's more complicated than that.

The exploits I linked are software only and could have been executed remotely and transparently.
Summary of the other hardware exploits is that they're easy and cheap to pull off for a motivated attacker, and that associating a good passphrase to your TREZOR or clone solves this problem. It's of course your choice to keep ignoring that and call FUD.


if it's fixed before black hats get an opportunity to exploit it yeah, that's the point.


The important point is that it makes the ecosystem safer for everybody. I'm not exactly running around yelling that TREZOR is broken, lol, or at least you seem to be the only one believing so.

Regarding side channel attacks, the main difference between generic microcontrollers and smartcards is that the smartcard vendor usually provides a cryptographic library that's well tested and designed to be resistant when running on specific hardware components - providing you use it, which will be answered in a future blog post :)
@_date: 2015-07-31 19:45:45
no worries :)
@_date: 2015-07-22 12:20:57
Not really - considering you cannot obtain anything from power/voltage glitching the embedded software (which is often easier), you'd have to decap the chip for Ledger as you said to obtain something, since it uses a smartcard component designed and certified to make physical attacks complicated.
For anything running on a regular microcontroller, it's far more likely that any chip protection could be circumvented with power/voltage glitching in order to reenable debugging protocols (JTAG) and dump the chip content, since it is not designed nor certified to withstand physical attacks.
This is why it is important IMHO to protect your TREZOR or clone with a good passphrase if you believe you can lose it and hold a significant amount on it without protecting it by another scheme (such as multisignature)
Both approaches have pros and cons and are interesting. Smartcards are cheap and physically resistant. Generic Microcontrollers are more powerful (CPU / RAM-flash size wise) and allow you to make everything open source.

The Paris office is "La Maison du Bitcoin", french version of a Bitcoin embassy. It's good to have a public location for meetups and overall education. Also organizing conferences and other events there help paying for it.
The office in that movie is located in Vierzon and basically subsidized by the government, electricity included. So, why not ?
Having an office in SF is also good to have in the Bitcoin space since a lot of traction, development and investment happens there.
So in the end also as a business owner (and former business owner before Ledger) I fail to see what's baffling or surprising about that. It's a fairly good use of the resources we have and a cheap enough growth strategy.

It seems to have no effect, at least to some variety of tripping. I ping pong'ed one to test that, and while the general update system is broken (which isn't very good, since you need a security update to get the new certificate that'll allow you to use the application), the TEE itself seems to stay happy.
I'd guess that it should stay that way unless the Secure Boot process itself is compromised, but that's just a wild guess, and the public beta will be a nice way to find out.

The old HID replay is an area in an unprotected zone, that does not survive firmware upgrades, used as a keyboard buffer. It was erroneously not wiped when entering 3 wrong PINs, so it could leak the seed if the device was just set up using the original HW.1 method and the setup procedure was not completed by entering the right PIN once - which is such a specific scenario that it couldn't possibly harm anybody (even if you leak that, you leak the seed to an empty wallet)

Unfortunately there's no such thing as fully open hardware either, so in the end you have to draw lines.


how do you check the code running on your machine ? how do you check your CPU microcode ? 


considering that the communication protocol between the black box and the external world is fully documented, and the black box is defined to act in a deterministic way, you can verify that it behaves as it should in typical execution scenarios, and that introducing backdoors given that would not be economically viable in practice. 


Do not trust a large amount of coins to a beta software looks like a good advice indeed.


I'd love to see a reference for fully auditable hardware that doesn't involve destroying the hardware.


Actually, we're claiming to use the security platform of the platform we're running on to be more secure than a generic Android application, and pretty much nothing else.


I have no problem claiming that this implementation is more secure than a vanilla Android application.

It's in progress for us (Ledger), [as an alpha that people can test]( but there are still several issues 
* It's merchant centric (we try to work around that by turning the wallet into a private CA)
* Validating a certificate is complicated for the user (UX gets messy, still way better than an address for sure but there should be more guidelines than just 'display the "Common Name" in the first X.509 certificate' which IMHO will lead to some impersonation drama)
* Revocation is even harder (and basically [demonstrated broken]( following Heartbleed)
* For some reason implementations only support RSA certificates, which doesn't help when you have a limited memory space

I meant persistent storage in the secure element itself. We just partitioned our EEPROM storage differently to have a small zone which can both survive updates and only be accessible for given code signatures.

Alternatively it might also work with a third party wallet, such as Electrum (but I'm not sure I'd like to try running Python+HIDAPI on XP either)
@_date: 2017-04-11 19:02:32
That's not different at all, we're talking about different things here.
The Hardware Wallet (device) works with different host wallets and doesn't care about UASF. Many people use Hardware Wallets with third party wallets not provided by the manufacturer.
Regarding our wallet Chrome application and our nodes (which are two different loosely related things) we'll offer an option to run on both sides of the fork immediately if it makes sense, or when things get stable otherwise.
In all cases we'll strongly advise our users to avoid transacting while a fork occurs unless they're absolutely sure of what they're doing and provide instructions to use the Hardware Wallets with third party wallets for users who want to be able to transact on all sides as soon as possible.

Ledger - You trust Secure Element
Meh. Here we go again
When you buy an already personalized product, you always trust at least the chip manufacturer and the device issuer. Using a Secure Element helps limiting your trust to those entities. 
Begin fully Open Source doesn't make a device magically easy to verify unless you build it and personalize it yourself.
@_date: 2017-04-11 19:48:59


yes, that goes for all hardware wallets


depending what people expect. If it's following a node blindly, it's ready. If it's selecting between two nodes, it's not ready, but that's not very complicated to do (we already do that for Ethereum)


We're not running UASF ready nodes yet. I don't see the point of signaling for the sake of signaling (for my personal opinion on signaling, see [my personal node signaling]( and I haven't reviewed the UASF code yet, so I don't plan to run that in production just now.


Supporting as "can work with", yes definitely. 
Supporting as "wish it'll happen", not really. I believe that Bitcoin works when incentives are aligned, and I'm not extremely interested in witnessing then cleaning up the bloody mess that a miners vs users (EC) or a users vs miners (UASF) internal war can create.


yes indeed
@_date: 2015-07-20 20:14:37
It's possible to have a combination of PC signers and Ledger signers. 
It could work with other wallets, but so far Coinkite only works with Ledger. 
Regarding standards, I'd have liked to use TREZOR Protocol Buffers, unfortunately we don't have enough RAM to implement it, and using APDUs is the natural way to communicate with a smartcard, making it easy to port on different bearers (such as NFC) or architectures (such as Java Card). But at a higher level the protocol is similar enough so that someone could easily create a top level librarary supporting TREZOR+clones and Ledger.
I think that's probably how things will look like in the future - there'll be a Protocol Buffers standard for "complex" devices, an APDU standard for smartcards, and a compatibility layer on top of both for easier integration (even if in my opinion it's already quite easy to add TREZOR or Ledger support in any product today)
@_date: 2016-02-21 11:42:15
I don't think it does on device password generation, but I can understand that because the password policy might be quite different per website - also it's Open Source, so people could tweak that.

not considering MCU backdoors you can verify the bootloader by loading your own firmware that'll dump it - but then a fake device (for example with a different MCU) could lie, so to be really sure you'd need to break open the device somehow.
@_date: 2015-08-20 09:53:17


I also fully agree with that and maybe simplified it too much - my point is that you get less effective freedom when forking consensus oriented code than when forking regular code - if miners run a diverging fork, they hurt the network. If you run a diverging fork and use it to gather information about the network, such as incoming transactions, you can hurt yourself in subtle ways that are hard to test before the problem happens. And if you want to test a consensus modification in your fork, you obviously can't recreate the user base, economic and social incentives in your simulated setup.
I'd insist on the social side because the previous uncontrolled forks (2013 and BIP 66) converged efficiently because the different parties collaborated swiftly. Who knows what would happen if this occurred now.
@_date: 2016-02-19 01:38:39

Meh, it's an horrible summary of a good [text]( that doesn't say this at all. 
TLDR : there are contradictions, changes to traditional systems brought by new concepts, such as blockchain technologies. It's interesting and people should look more closely at what's happening. 
Just translating the blockchain part 
The blockchain is a data transfer protocol which is open source, temper resistant, distributed and decentralized, where the information is spread across all nodes of the network. The blockchain changes states monopoly on money and associated instruments, banks monopoly on financial transactions and notaries monopoly on real estate transactions. Bitcoin (one of Internet crypto currencies) is based on Blockchain technologies. The blockchain could potentially replace all centralized trusted third parties (banks, notaries, land registration, civil registers, and many sovereign functions of the state) by its decentralized peer to peer trust network. It's a revolutionary technology that kills centralized institutions.

Does Ledger Wallet Service (the other installed application) displays "Status : Ready" when you open it ?
@_date: 2015-07-29 15:12:36


During setup, the phone and the Ledger dongle are paired by exchanging a symmetric key - this is done with an ECDH key exchange.
When performing a transaction, the content is encrypted by the Ledger dongle and sent back to the phone along with an encrypted PIN
The phone displays the transaction and the PIN, sends back the cleartext PIN to the dongle, which checks it and signs if it's correct.
Compromising this check would mean compromising at the same time the PC and the phone, and synchronizing the malware between both. 
No Ledger servers are involved.


You want to buy something or pay someone. You receive a mail or browse a web page. The malware replaces the address here before it's displayed. There are also been some cases of rogue Chrome extensions doing that. Having a screen wouldn't help against this, obviously.
To summarize, I'm not saying having a screen is useless, just that thinking it'd automagically solve everything is a mistake.

I didn't look specifically into Trustonic implementation but the general idea is that TrustZone can be used to lock peripherals when the Secure World is executing, guaranteed by the hardware.

The installation process is quite painful and will get better once Samsung sorts out a certificate provisioning issue (we currently have to push 2 applications due to a provisioning problem).

And a few minutes if you use something based on a regular MCU.

Keybase defines rendez-vous points and uses social medias to solve the hard part of a cryptographic web of trust : how to boostrap keys, and provides tools to use GPG in a more intuitive way, targeting users instead of keys. It is not crypto currency centric, but could be used (later) to bootstrap a (set of) Bitcoin public key(s)
BitID is a protocol, not a company, used to authenticate an entity using a message signature from a Bitcoin address. It doesn't link addresses and users.
Bitrated defines a reputation for a Bitcoin address, by using a web of trust and a scoring system. I'd say that the scoring system is the important part of that service.
OneName let you advertise a Bitcoin address associated to you, it doesn't focus on the web of trust.

When you buy some ready to use hardware, you have to trust at least 2 entities : the chip manufacturer, and the entity doing the initial chip personalization. 
We (Ledger) chose to use dedicated secure chips (which unfortunately prevent to create a fully Open Source / Open Hardware solution, but allow to be close enough) to distribute ready to use hardware, in order to make sure that you don't need to trust any additional entities (the factory manufacturing the product, anybody touching the device before it reaches you, and so on)
One alternative is to build a hardware wallet yourself using an Open Source solution, which is extremely nice but not scalable at all. And of course you'd still have to trust the chip manufacturer, and give up on the nice features that secure chips can provide (protection against physical attacks, hardware assisted protection against software attacks, proof of execution on a trusted platform ...)
Edit : also, Ledger latest platform is not closed source. Applications are open source / modifiable and the isolation logic is auditable enough with the right skillset
@_date: 2016-02-05 22:29:56

I think Bitcoin will always compete for the last mile (exchange to fiat) when there are already established businesses - in that case, it probably makes more sense for those businesses to transact with Bitcoin, and pocket the savings, which wouldn't be very useful for the end users.

Not considering that a lot of people would be reluctant to that, NFC user experience can be a bit weird - you have to make sure than the card antenna is properly aligned in the field generated by the reader, even more so when dealing with a complex application - it's usually transparent for credit cards because they use a large antenna and the PoS terminals are properly calibrated but it gets more tricky for smaller devices and multi purpose terminals.

that seems complicated to achieve before reaching singularity and code starts writing itself. In the meantime it can be chosen by technical merit or by campaigning and I'd rather have the former.
@_date: 2016-02-25 07:43:56


you can't audit either what happens in any CPU, so it's probably time to get back to ECDSA with pen and paper :)


Those issues have been hyped to hell (close second to BadUSB) but I'm still waiting for a proof of concept. The main design goal of TrustZone is isolation, so I'd assume a proper TEE implementation does that correctly (i.e. typically living in its own encrypted RAM area for critical structures)


the Secure Enclave is closer to the TEE than TrustZone. It relies on TrustZone, among other things. But I'd say that's more an issue for privacy / encryption applications than for Bitcoin wallets, for which malware is the biggest threat, and an isolation solution that makes it harder (close to impossible) for userland applications to break into the kernel is still a quite significant step forward IMHO.

@_date: 2016-02-13 16:02:00
it all depends what you call open source hardware. If you really want to verify everything, you also need an open MCU, which is not easily doable yet for an acceptable price point.
another almost as non acceptable step to verify what it's running is to build it yourself - but every other method requires you trust the manufacturer or whoever built it - in that case Open Source code doesn't really provide you many guarantees, as the hardware could make you think you're running something while actually running something else.
that being said, I totally support that kind of hardware, just stay aware of the limitations.
@_date: 2015-07-31 04:27:38
this will change in the next firmware version (see  ), and is not really that much of an issue considering you only do it once per update and we provide all the necessary tools to do it quickly.

yes, and remember that everything in security is about balance. 
Typically our new products will be based on a large Open Source part and binary blobs with a different surface depending on the target architecture. 
At some point, you might have to choose between a high quality Open Source ECC library implementation ([libsecp256k1]( that'd still sign in a few seconds on that given hardware, or a proprietary accelerator that claims to have the same security properties and more, and signs in a few milliseconds.
If you're pragmatic, it's a clear choice - you can check that there are no covert channels from the accelerator outputs, and you can verify the security claimed by the accelerator by observing its power consumption and timings. Running the Open Source code in that specific case would give you warm, fuzzy and slow feelings but not much more.
That's why I strongly advocate being pragmatic when designing Bitcoin specific hardware or generic "devices of trust" : open source whatever you can given the properties you're looking for, balancing openness, price and security. If you cannot open source something, have a good reason to do so, can explain it and the security consequences on the whole architecture, fine, go ahead, people will listen and approve. However if you don't open source something but cannot provide a good reason why, people will rightfully walk away.
@_date: 2017-04-06 06:20:26
My main problem with it is that an optimization is supposed to be transparent wrt. what is being processed. Here the "optimization" forces the hashed data to have a specific format, which could be considered cheating if you're feeling pedantic (if PoW is a race, every competitor is supposed to "run" the same distance), but more annoyingly prevents changes made to the protocol by assuming that it should always be possible to use this specific format enabling the optimization, which is not acceptable.

it's an issue with the synchronization process which is hard enough to track as all teams are focused on the applications redesign, likely related to a communication failure between the Chrome app and the server ending up with the application storage being corrupted - it's fixable by either deleting storage data in the app settings and resynchonizing or deleting / reinstalling the application.

The pros outweight the cons in my opinion (but I might be slightly biased :p) it allows us to make cool things - for example if you want to build an [OpenDime lookalike]( without trusted hardware, well, it's not going to work very well.
@_date: 2016-02-25 16:45:02
it's a bit different - iOS binds keys to applications using some similar mechanism, but not the application logic. If a malware gains kernel level access, it can impersonate the calling application and get access to the keys. The TEE puts the full application logic in the protected area, so even if a malware gains kernel level access it wouldn't be able to fake the user approval (if there is a Trusted UI) or the second factor (if there is no Trusted UI)
@_date: 2016-02-18 19:38:16
forwarded to the team - shouldn't be a problem to add this
@_date: 2015-08-08 08:00:09


I don't think that's very likely, and that wouldn't make a particular device obsolete (as in, most other non specialized devices would be vulnerable to it). In my opinion an unpatchable physical attack that let you dump the flash easily on a stolen generic purpose device such as TREZOR is a much bigger threat, and in that case, protecting it with a good passphrase in the first place solves the problem. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 17:03:16

@_date: 2017-04-16 14:31:35


ok, that's quite unfortunate. 
On the security side of things, I'd suggest deriving a different BIP 32 path for each password. Here leaking a single key would expose all passwords (and working on the master key should be avoided IMHO) - that issue is also amplified by the AES implementation not being constant time. 
On the usability/recovery side of things, I'd also suggest to include a mode where you input the mnemonic and it goes on decrypting the passwords without a device.

Not exactly. Forking is not decided by the Hardware Wallet, it's decided by the host wallet and/or the associated node or backend. Our policy on hard forks has been stated on our blog before ( and the same comments apply for UASF : if it can split the network in a non deterministic behaviour, we'll advise our users to stop transacting with our nodes until the dust settles, then offer both backends if it makes sense. If it can split the network in a deterministic behavior (typically with a flag day policy) we'll offer an option to support both backends as soon as possible.

Most people using a Safenet HSM (or any HSM for a Bitcoin use case) will probably load their own code on it and run that, because it doesn't really make sense to use the standard derivation primitives which are not suitable for Bitcoin, so I'm not too concerned about generic PKCS  issues. 
@_date: 2016-09-24 16:32:27
Electrum uses its own seed format, which only works with Electrum as far as I know.
Other wallets usually use the [BIP 39]( standard, which means that they can produce the same key set if they use the same derivation standard with the same parameters (usually [BIP 44](
In any case, entering a seed into a wallet that doesn't support it or derive on a different path is harmless. Worst case scenario, you'll see a zero balance, just don't panic and think about using different parameters (typically, the BIP 44 account or the BIP 39 passphrase, since derivation paths should be fairly compatible) or a different wallet.

Oh well, I guess if you don't want to spend time learning your embedded security history, you have to get it reminded to you from time to time ... so here goes 
1) Your security (bootloader protection specifically) rely on specific STM32 parts which are about as closed as everything that goes in a Secure Element. If you want to prove me wrong, just drive me through the boot process of your chip.
You claim people can verify the full stack ? Sure, how do they verify the bootloader ? Then how do they do it without actually opening (thus destroying) the device to make sure that they're not talking to a chip-in-the-middle that'd answer what they want to hear ?
2) No sorry, making sure that your device wasn't flashed to something malicious during your distribution is also quite important, especially considering 1) where the only way to verify the integrity of your device is to destroy it. 
HODLers will also fully appreciate that the real risk is ONLINE, I guess.
3) Nobody is talking about decapping the chip in a lab - the real issue is fault injection attacks, which **WILL** happen, and allow people to retrieve the seed in a few minutes / seconds.
Your only solution against this is the passphrase. Sure, problem is, you're not forcing it on your users, you're even not encouraging it at all. Claiming that your password manager works "[without a master password]( means that you don't want a passphrase here. U2F doesn't use the passphrase. PGP [doesn't use the passphrase]( either.
That's what you get when your security model is inconsistent - inconsistencies. The sad part is that the risk of losing key material for other protocols is much worse than losing it for Bitcoin, where you can revoke it instantly by sending a transaction.
4) Claiming that Secure Elements were compromised because Chip &amp; PIN has been compromised is about as silly as claiming that Bitcoin was hacked when MtGox happened. There's a difference between a weak protocol (which has to cope with everything that's been deployed for almost 40 years) and the hardware that implements it.
5) Using Secure Elements is not jumping on a bandwagon - it's acknowledging that they're the best solution for a given set of problems (not all problems, mind you), which happen to be shared by all security devices : making sure that your device has not been tampered with during production, and protecting the secrets against the most diverse attacks.
States have been using it, the banking industry has been doing it, the identity industry has been doing it,  the pay TV industry has been doing it, Open Source projects such as [Nitrokey]( and [Mooltipass]( have been doing it, yet you think you know better than what the security industry learned in the past 30 years ? Please wise up.
A better approach is to learn from history and improve the status quo, not dismiss it because you don't understand it. This is what we are doing by [creating more open Secure Element Operating Systems](

iOS can pretty much only support BLE hardware wallets. You have 3 available today : Bitlox, Coolwallet and Ledger Blue (developer edition), then Mycelium has to add support for them - speaking for Ledger we'll be working ln that in December when Ledger Blue is officially out for the general public.
@_date: 2016-02-06 22:07:34
A few bitcoinJ based wallets (such as [GreenBits]( use it because it has working Java bindings already, but yes, more wallets should support it, that's the idea, even if it's not fully tested it's still better than using OpenSSL or interpreted code. Shouldn't be too hard because is also has [Python bindings](

Bitcoin is perfectly usable for merchants that do not deliver the goods on the spot, like Overclock. They can have multiple reasons to remove Bitcoin payments (too much maintenance vs number of users, complex UX, site redesign, ...) but the network performance is definitely not a valid one.

for security related products, the alternatives are usually worse : much more expensive (since they feature many additional functionalities that aren't used) and advertising security features that are also not auditable (and with no incentive to be properly audited as the primary market of those chips is not security products)
@_date: 2018-11-24 19:33:47
So I assume you'll have no problem pointing me to a Common Criteria certification of this chip ?

A paper wallet doesn't help against malware if you use it on an infected computer, a hardware wallet does. Also it's significantly more convenient to handle change without reusing keys.

From the abstract "This BIP describes the next step in making Bitcoin's most basic element, the transaction, more flexible and easier to extend. At the same time this fixes all known cases of malleability and resolves significant amounts of technical debt."
I consider that the quadratic scaling problem is a technical debt. 
But if you meant that it's hard to know exactly what this specification is about, I'd also agree on that.
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:25:58
The "Bitcoin Segwit" prompts dates back from 2x and hasn't been changed since.
@_date: 2016-09-23 16:50:15
It doesn't seem like this proposal commits to the value of the previous inputs, so on that part it's quite inferior to Segwit for Hardware Wallets regarding performance optimizations.
It's also not clear in the specification if the signature scheme solves the quadratic scaling problem addressed by Segwit, but I think it doesn't.
@_date: 2017-04-30 13:43:35


uh, could you point exactly to the same kind of hardware that hardware wallets share with cheap memory sticks ?
@_date: 2017-04-09 18:48:45
no, you only need to have it plugged when signing a transaction you are sending. Confirmation times are variable depending on network conditions, fees set by the sender and so on
@_date: 2017-04-22 13:27:57
Not very scalable unfortunately.

Again if you're not satisfied with your Blue you can request a refund. You don't have to repost the same thing everywhere.
@_date: 2016-09-26 05:09:26
you'd have to spend it on a similar configuration to be safe against malware, which is not really practical. The second part refers to change addresses - if you don't spend your paper wallet fully you'll generate change, which can be sent to the previous address (which is bad for privacy and hypothetical future attacks on elliptic curve cryptography), or to an new address (whuch would require a different paper ewallet, also making things less practical)

Saleem decision was his own - other researchers signed, got the bounty and will publish. Also the most interesting bugs (in my opinion) were found while auditing the kernel as a black box, demonstrating that it's very much possible to audit the closed parts.

"Annoying updates all the times" as in approximately one every 6 months, ok
@_date: 2019-01-04 20:11:12
you seem to be confusing openness of the code and openness of a solution. The code being open is just a small part of the problem if the chip isn't.
@_date: 2016-09-20 10:07:19
yes, it's only available for Chrome. Unfortunately Chrome is the only browser to support native communication with arbitrary USB HID devices for the time being.
@_date: 2016-09-01 14:46:20
for those who want to dig into it it's already quite easy, btw. You can build a Skylake ready configuration from super cheap spare parts (I used an AsRock H110M-DVS/D3 mainboard and Core i3-6100 CPU, total costing less than 200 euros), install an Ubuntu 14.04 or more recent (just make sure the kernel doesn't mandate signed modules - 4.2.0-41 is fine for example, -42 is not, unless Canonical decided to release a signed SGX driver in the meantime) and have fun with the [Linux SDK](
it works well as long as you don't plan to use it for anything secure in production (as you can't turn off the enclave debugger).
@_date: 2016-09-05 12:20:07


no, as it's not doable in a reliable way with a generic microcontroller - there isn't a process to order custom chips with your own root of trust from the manufacturer.
@_date: 2019-01-16 13:17:38
Well I can understand that people get annoyed by the way Bitpay doesn't let you use the wallet you want to pay an invoice. I hope they can also understand that we have limited resources to explore alternative solutions since this isn't related to our core business or revenue source.

there's no commercial chip that can be fully audited today unfortunately
@_date: 2019-01-05 22:16:54
My point again is that reading the code is a small part of verifying what something running on specific hardware does.
@_date: 2016-09-24 10:21:45
it's not really manageable if all wallets and all devices have to deal with all optional / TBD tags in my opinion. Also if you submit a new proposal for a problem that's already solved I would expect it to be at least as feature complete as the other proposal.

the idea would be to set a quota, and use that for hotwallets that disable themselves automatically for example. 
closer to TPMs, we also have an implementation for SGX that's sitting on a nice shelf until we know if we can post it to Github or not ... 
@_date: 2016-09-20 08:39:31
yes, there are many improvements doable on that part, starting with BIP 70 support to make sure that there's an end to end secure channel between the exchange and the hardware wallet (similar to what KeepKey did with Shapeshift, but in a standard and interoperable way). It's a good starting point nonetheless.
@_date: 2019-01-02 16:23:12
My conclusion was that you'd lack information in most cases today when hardware is involved, and that using an architecture to hold secrets which has been validated for the past 40 years seems to be a good choice.

my personal answer to that is "way too much"


it's a bit too early to say that until there are enough reports regarding the battery life. This is a common issue with display cards, as it's quite hard to get right, and not possible to fix after it goes wrong.
@_date: 2016-09-14 07:13:47
only at close range and when pairing the device, so I'd say that your ISP probably already has more information.
@_date: 2016-09-14 19:41:57
it's unfortunately not possible to release a fully free software implementation on secure hardware for the time being, but the benefits (price, distribution strategy, protection against physical attacks, extended protection against software attacks) outweight the problem quite significantly in my opinion. We're of course following development of truly free secure hardware very closely, but I believe we're trying our best to provide the better parts of both worlds in the meantime
@_date: 2016-09-22 04:44:53
Are we going to get one post per block ? I understand you're proud that the whole setup didn't burst into flames just yet but still that seems a bit unnecessary.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:50:13
Yes, storage is quite limited (around 200 Kb). This will be optimized by the upcoming mobile &amp; desktop application suite which will transparently delete &amp; load the right application on device according to the crypto currency you're currently using, and by the upcoming firmware release which will enable smaller applications by using libraries.
@_date: 2019-01-02 23:35:39
Bech32 has been supported since October 2017 (available on Electrum), and most new cryptocurrency applications are added by third party developers. We focus on building the platform.

This is fixed in the latest BTC app (1.1.9)

Others that are not compatible with the previous requirement, obviously, as the former would be a simple drop in replacement and quick tests

You can see  for the official response to the conference. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:04:13
It's not dangerous at all. All applications are signed and locked to a specific BIP 32 path, so random coin  cannot steal your crypto stash.
It's the best possible model to support a large number of different assets with minimal risks, compared to a monolithic firmware
@_date: 2019-01-16 13:50:13
That's unfortunate because this has absolutely nothing to do with our product offering
@_date: 2019-01-17 07:30:14
We don't have competitors offering a similar product
@_date: 2019-01-16 10:07:52
It seems hard to gather metrics on things that can be trivially sybil attacked. One clear thing is that payments in crypto are a small volume of our orders (already before Bitpay creative use of BIP 70)
@_date: 2016-09-15 05:01:02
We made that binary blob. It'll get smaller over time but there'll always be a proprietary part on most of those secure chips as far as I can tell - we described that architecture in a Medium post : 
it is also in my opinion quite acceptable as long as you can audit or isolate it reasonably easily.

As state in the blog, the 1x distinction was only made for the purpose of this blog entry to let people kniw what we were discussing. Bitcoin has always been named Bitcoin in the application. 
It's also my belief that a company with more financial ressources is harder to coerce than a company with less financial ressources (just because it can quickly route around problems or fight back)

You should base your purchasing decision on the merits of what you plan to buy instead of the choice of a payment provider.

Two bugs were actually found in the Open Source code, and all the isolation bugs were found while auditing the kernel code as a black box, demonstrating that this method works quite well.

The underlying behavior is necessary for security reasons. If you could update a library without removing the applications using it this could easily be abused to attack all applications by loading a rogue library. This is not an issue for applications which are signed by Ledger but could easily be a valid concern for someone else if you consider that the device is an open platform.
The proper way around it is to abstract it in the upper layers - i.e. delete all related applications when you want to update the library, then reinstall them (which wouldn't work properly if any of those applications stores an internal state, but that isn't the case for any application using a library so far). This is being worked on.
@_date: 2019-01-02 16:45:22
well, those are completely different things. Your code being Open Source doesn't provide any information related to the security of the architecture you're running it on, which could undermine the entire product.
@_date: 2019-01-05 00:23:51
The best security practices are to be pragmatic and use the best tool for the job given your threat model. If you include physical attackers I don't see any viable open chip option right now.
@_date: 2019-01-05 08:47:23
I'm building Ledger actually, you can verify all applications yourself and also validate the kernel as a black box. Multiple researchers have done that and reported issues that got fixed, so it seems auditable with the right skillset.
You won't know what Open Source code is doing either if you can't audit the chip that's running it, which you can't do.
@_date: 2019-01-07 16:29:58
you can do that with Electrum
@_date: 2019-01-07 18:39:28
Yes, it doesn't offer the automated conversion we need as far as I know
@_date: 2019-01-02 15:44:53
you can't audit pretty much all popular commercial chips available today either

They don't answer on reddit. But if you ask a smart question I can try to provide a smart answer. Usually people like that.
@_date: 2017-09-27 04:17:44
You can verify the applications against their Open Source code and the isolation against the principles described in  - this validation method ("certification by composition") is leveraging on a technology that has been validated for security critical markets since the first banking cards were created in the 1980s
When you buy a hardware product you didn't build yourself, you always have to trust at least the chip manufacturer and the product manufacturer. By using Secure Elements, we make sure that you don't have to trust any other party in the chain.
For more information about the upcoming future, I'd suggest reading my old threat model presentation  or the presentation I gave at Breaking Bitcoin

We (Ledger) added Segwit2x nodes because we prepared for a fork that people could leverage. No other implications with it and certainly not active support.

The Nano unfortunately doesn't have enough space to handle BIP 39 derivation properly on device (I tried hard but never managed to end up with something stable enough). An alternative would be to derive a non interoperable hexadecimal BIP 32 seed on device, but that wouldn't be very nice either - so we require a trusted computer for an interoperable setup, which is in my opinion acceptable for the most cost effective hardware wallet on the market.
The Nano S can of course derive the seed onboard.

Not that much if you're considering a physical attacker
@_date: 2019-01-08 00:13:19

they will and already announced it.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:40:35
well we're talking about receiving addresses here so I don't see how I'm misleading. An address you send to should indeed be verified over a second channel or a protocol that guarantees the address integrity
@_date: 2019-01-16 08:52:44
"Being adament to keep using Bitpay" uh. Being a payment provider isn't part of our business model and we have limited resources to spend on this issue. If you have a working alternative that provide the same API and the same functionalities (convert to fiat with a locked rate) with the same reliability for the same price we'd be happy to reconsider.
@_date: 2017-09-24 21:39:09
You can verify (recompile yourself) the application working on the Nano S - on HW.1 you can verify it as a blackbox against the API, so it's less easy but you can still check that it's doing what it's supposed to do and that the clients only call the described APIs. 
@_date: 2016-09-13 21:16:38


I still don't believe it is for that kind of business that doesn't need to deliver instantly.


It's (unfortunately) transparent for most of them, since they go through a payment process and don't really accept BTC.


It was a gamble, and it'll still be a gamble with layer 2 solutions. There are many gambles in all kind of industries when you want to be on the bleeding edge - at least Bitcoin makes it extremely cheap to experiment compared to other industries, probably even the cheapest fintech experiment that could exist, so I'm still optimistic, even if things take more time to happen.
@_date: 2019-01-03 12:33:48
You bought a hardware wallet which is compatible with multiple software wallets. Not all software wallets offer the same functionalities. You can use any of them without any security risk.
@_date: 2016-09-14 05:31:42
you don't really care about those - it's a wireless wire, nothing more. Everything that goes over the wire is supposed to be either not trusted (addresses that are validated on the hardware wallet) or public (signatures).
@_date: 2016-09-01 14:53:25
If you're talking about hardware wallets - no, the point of this (quite clever) hack is to use a connected USB device as a transmitter to export secret data which is located on an airgapped computer. The point of hardware wallets is to avoid exposing this secret data in the first place.

@_date: 2016-09-15 07:53:12
the manufacturer would find us and kill us (tm) if we did. It's kind of a silly, outdated and backward rule but not disclosing some internal chip logic is part of the security evaluation, so they protect it quite strongly. Our workaround is to keep working to make us less dependant on those APIs as we move along.

ok, so you're reporting a problem I can't reproduce but won't assist in solving it. Well good luck to you then.

@_date: 2017-09-03 10:49:32
This doesn't make much economic sense though - it's significantly more likely to be detected than to be successful. Also thinking that being Open Source solves this problem is rather naive - there's nothing preventing a chip-in-the-middle from doing that, unless you build and flash (from scratch, not from a hopefully-not-compromised-bootloader) the device yourself.

Hardware Wallets have to stream the parent transaction of each input to extract the associated value in a trustless way, so it's pretty significant (especially when considering large parent transactions from services distributing daily payouts)

Err, the only way to be sure is to have the user verify it. Upgrading from a malware changing a file to something acting like a greasemonkey plugin isn't exactly rocket science.
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:36:07
it's still extremely likely that a skilled attacker with physical access will manage to recover the seed quickly on a generic microcontroller - if you worry about that, you should always set a strong passphrase.
@_date: 2017-09-25 11:03:17
It's not trivial at all to bypass the verification process if you perform both the software &amp; visual checks described in 
The visual check is important because the easiest way to compromise such a chain of trust is to have a rogue chip sitting in the middle

All light clients could download the forking block and check its size to verify on which chain a given peer is. Also I think Bread allows users to pair to a specific full node which solves the problem.
Sending a TX is different : if you don't implement a specific mechanism to split your coins, anybody can replay your transaction on the other chain.

My point is that it's definitely not convenient to make something that's both random and profitable considering people are testing it, that you can proxy it and verify it, and that you're free to rewrite the ECDSA signing operation if you care about that particular unrealistic threat and don't mind signing more slowly with less protection about passive analysis.
Being fully open source and verifiable is a nice goal to achieve, but extremely complicated for mass produced consumer hardware. In the meantime using chips designed to hold secrets (and doing so successfuly since the 1980s) for a product holding secrets seems like an appropriate option.

If the fees were too low, it's normal for the TX to take time to confirm - some nodes might lose it, others might  rebroadcast it. Once the transaction is on the network, it stays on the network - any operation performed on a hardware wallet doesn't matter.

Just in case you're looking for another good reason to upgrade, the other exploit (software based) was about redirecting a transaction change to an arbitrary address without prompting anything.

@_date: 2015-04-20 04:08:09
Generally speaking about services using the same concept : no, you don't need additional software on the phone, that's the point. You may need to know where your Sim Toolkit menu is and how to launch it though - there are some tricks that can make this easier (such as dialing a magic number, or popping up the menu when the phone starts) but that don't really work in a reliable way on all phones
Sim Toolkit offers a very simple User Interface - a list of items that you can select, simple text entry, text display. No graphics at all. 
Messages can be encrypted end to end, service to applet running on the Java Card. So you don't need to trust the SMS provider. You still need to trust the remote party and the applet running on the card though.

Yes, the generation method is documented [in the specification]( and you also have [a sample implementation]( on github
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:59:01
My thought about it after reading the vulnerability report - it affects a specific cryptographic library provided by Infineon. On a typical Secure Element, there's a dedicated cryptoprocessor which you can either address directly or through a vendor library. Users are encouraged to use the vendor library, which apparently wasn't a good idea in that case. But the vulnerability is strictly limited to the way this library interacts with the cryptoprocessor to generate RSA keys - the cryptoprocessor or the RNG are not faulty.
@_date: 2015-04-10 00:54:50
only considering the code : regarding side channels attacks, yes, with large efforts. regarding glitching attacks targeting the application code, almost, but not quite. regarding glitching attacks targeting the chip or involving decapping, absolutely not, so the passphrase helps mitigates that.

yes, our take on that for our next product will be to use a secure microcontroller to do the sensitive work you don't want to leak, and a generic microcontroller to check that everything has been done correctly.
as a bonus, the secure microcontroller can validate the generic microcontroller firmware, and people that don't trust the secure microcontroller at all can run everything in the generic microcontroller at their own risk.
@_date: 2015-04-10 01:03:47
much less time than what people typically expect, as demonstrated in this attack.
@_date: 2015-04-01 06:04:03
that could work, but the mnemonic generation part is actually done by the host, because doing it on the card would be too long (about 4 minutes). This is why it needs to be done on a secure host.
@_date: 2015-04-06 06:19:07
yes, that could be doable. I'll push the idea internally. My personal favorite choice would be [SliTaz]( for that.

I haven't followed iOS much, but back then it was extremely tricky (I actually had to jailbreak, which is always awesome to promote a security feature).
There are several scenarios that could work, off the top of my head, from the less hackish to the most hackish :
- The OS can send an arbitrary APDU command to the card
- The OS can send an ENVELOPE APDU command to the card
- The OS can write an arbitrary file on the SIM file system, and the proxy-SIM can listen for arbitrary files modifications
- The OS can write a SMS on the SIM file system, and the proxy-SIM can listen for SMS modifications
- The OS can write an address record (ADN) on the SIM file system, and the proxy-SIM can listen for ADN modifications

considering you can check the hardware and the software, why not ?

It is available in a lot of Samsung phones following the Galaxy S3. But the Trusted UI is only available in recent models (some Galaxy Note 4 and all/most/a lot of Galaxy S6, I don't know exactly yet)


The first version maps [our existing Ledger API]( with a different hackish transport method (chosen to avoid contaminating the wallets with proprietary stuff) and a few additions related to the Trusted UI (or lack of Trusted UI) that'll be documented soon when the beta opens. You can already check our reference implementations (only when the Trusted UI is available so far) for [Greenbits] ( and [Mycelium]( - [this commit]( shows the main changes between Ledger Nano and Ledger Trustlet support. 
Also [the blog post]( shows what will be done when the Trusted UI is not available.

"Open Hardware" can mean a lot of different things.
Offering schematics using off the shelf components is Open Hardware, but not so much if those components have proprietary firmwares / no specifications / and so on. 
The goal of Novena is to build a general purpose computer from non proprietary hardware components (which is way more complex than building a Bitcoin hardware wallet, and also totally different). Novena is not designed to be secure, it's designed to be open, easy to hack, and a fun environment to hack on hardware. Note the **This is not a device made for consumer home use**
Also people interested in making the Novena more secure (as in "more capable of protecting secrets from malware or an attacker") might be able to leverage on the iMX6, since Freescale offers one of the few documented full TrustZone implementation with no NDAs (also the vendor used in the [USB Armory project]( To be checked more carefully though.
@_date: 2015-04-02 16:22:34
In my opinion it's better to define higher level adapters for common operations.
Today both TREZOR and us (Ledger) offer the same functionalities API wise, but it's not possible to use Protocol Buffers on our original devices, because its RAM usage is too heavy. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 23:57:47
Another good use case of firmware updates is to let you check what is the code actually running in the device. 
If you don't have JTAG and cannot load your own firmware to dump the bootloader and verify the full chain of trust, then you have no way to check that, which considerably reduces the benefits of being open source in my opinion.
 
@_date: 2015-04-20 18:11:47
Probably not - there are already [mechanisms to protect arbitrary protocols on ARM chips]( It doesn't really make economic sense to design something specific security wise for Bitcoin.

Secure microcontrollers can provide some additional protection against side channel attacks, for example by delegating critical mathematical operations to another core designed to leak less, but a significant protection layer is done purely in software, and duplicating that one on a generic microcontroller would provide reasonable protection against attackers (this is where the community is getting with properly designed and audited crypto libraries)
Regarding software application code and glitching attacks, a secure microcontroller can make sure that the code is following pre-defined paths for critical function calls, and abort if that's not the case (kind of a typical app signature function, but executed at the CPU level) - this is great to protect against key leaks.
Regarding purely glitching attacks, a secure microcontroller runs on a variable clock and checks for variations of the power supply, which prevents most amateur attacks
This goes on top of the typical features used to protect against intrusive attacks (encrypted memory, encrypted data buses, physical mesh).
Note that this doesn't mean that secure microcontrollers are a magic silver bullet solving everything - using one properly enough just raises the attacker budget from 100$ to 100k$, and changes the time needed to perform the attack from a couple seconds to a couple weeks/months
@_date: 2015-04-30 21:50:35
Exynos too ?
@_date: 2015-04-09 20:23:29
Some devices are harder to break (as in, recovering meaningful information from them) than others. This is why for example STMicroelectronics splits the [Secure Microcontrollers]( and [Generic Microcontrollers]( in totally different business units.

Nothing new or revolutionary - it lets you write applications in a very portable and slightly more open way on the most secure chips. From there your application, integration with other hardware components, actual deployment may vary. 
The above was about Java Card, of course. Use of proxy SIMs technology for Bitcoin is new. Proxy SIMs themselves are not new. Java Card Bitcoin applications are not new either.
@_date: 2015-04-09 19:45:39
I'd also advise everyone serious about security to set up a passphrase on their TREZOR. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 21:02:05
You can set a longer PIN with the API, but you cannot verify it in the Chrome app after that I think.
@_date: 2015-04-09 19:52:29
No, but it protects you against the worst one - if the chip is attacked and JTAG can be reenabled, or the flash dumped easily (which is pretty much a **when** rather than an **if**), at least you don't give out your seed right away.
@_date: 2015-04-29 15:12:18
Yes, but only recent ones include a Trusted UI, which allows to directly confirm the transaction on screen - we'll have some other mechanisms when it's not available, which are less elegant but still worth using. They'll be described in a blog post shortly and also available for testers.
@_date: 2015-04-22 03:22:28

yes you can keep it, just make sure it's not trivial to guess.
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:27:30
How do you create the multi signature address ? You typically use a private key you own, and a public key owned by the remote party. If the party creating the multi signature address is compromised, it can create a "wrong" receiving address that can be emptied by an attacker. 
I think that this point is often overlooked in multisignature designs - protecting the party creating the addresses is as important as protecting the signing parties.
@_date: 2015-04-25 01:04:57
Depends when you got your Yubikey. If you got it [in an old batch]( you can still use it as a open Java Card platform and update applications.
Blows my mind why the developer program (which let you basically fully own your card, giving you the keys to install your own applications) has not been released yet for the other batches though. You'd be able to update the application that way.
@_date: 2015-04-16 23:55:13
Typically your PIN implementation is not correct ([increasing attempts after the check]( - this is one of the most common mistake listed in the presentation, and also a reason why firmware updates are important. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 00:19:25


yes. my personal advice is to consider as a toy (i.e. trivially glitchable, with more or less fatal implementation errors, ...) any chip that doesn't have at least an EAL 4+ certification (the first level where attacks are actually attempted)
@_date: 2015-04-08 00:36:44

If that's your only beef with other existing documented standards, then by all means please add it. And it's nothing new - U2F even does its best to enforce different identities per *account* (and actually gives you a way to check if accounts were already registered for an actual URI)


Really ? Are we comparing exposing an URI that any wallet on any platform can actually act on to some trampoline scheme involving some page hosted on github and a binary plugin targeting a single device from a single vendor ? 


Yes, at that point it's pretty obvious that you're misusing open source to push for vendor lock-in and against interoperability. You know it's a sad state of affairs when it's a guy busy opening proprietary hardware that has to tell you that.

This video demonstrates an attack that was essentially useless - running arbitrary code on the MCU without bypassing the Secure Element authentication isn't a threat. I wouldn't suggest to use a passphrase on a Ledger device unless you know what you're doing, as it's an additional risk to lose coins if you forget it.
@_date: 2015-09-22 20:58:04
that's why it's possible to recreate a new table from time to time, for example after 10 transactions. The future versions will also provide a method to lock transactions to well known addresses or BIP 70 authenticated receivers. 
If you have other ideas, feel free to play with them [with the Open Source code]( Fidesmo platform makes it easy to test new things.

@_date: 2017-10-10 07:02:22
no, because the OS locks them on a specific BIP 32 path - the worst thing a malware can do is basically steal keys on its own path, which is not extremely productive
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:18:15
likely a few hours after the fork if everything works as expected. We'll also evaluate the integration into existing public splitting service for users who would like to use them immediately after the fork.

yes, actually on an implementation with a screen (TEE / Blue) there'll be a second factor. It gets in the way of the UX with the Nano, or can end up in broken situations where the phone second factor is also the second signer.

My understanding is that all S6 models support Trustonic TEE, remote provisioning and the Trusted UI but I might be wrong here - anyway it's free to test.

interesting, I'll recheck that with NXP. My random guesses is that either NXP is selling the unlocking service directly, or that they entered some weird certification level for JCOP that makes it necessary to identify who's loading applets on the card to avoid fuzzing attacks. Hopefully the former.

There's an [extremely old GSM standard]( supported by all phones that let you design very simple User Interfaces and remote SMS based communication protocols, powered by the SIM card (exchanging commands between the SIM card and the phone). The SIM asks the phone to create a menu, the SIM asks the phone to send a SMS, and so on.
The proposed solution acts as a proxy between the SIM card and the phone to intercept those commands and insert its own, which offer an interface to a Bitcoin wallet, while preserving the original SIM functionalities (i.e. mostly the authentication to the network)

That the seed is useless without the passphrase, yes. It only protects you against one class of physical attacks, which is the only one you cannot mitigate with software on a generic microcontroller.
@_date: 2015-04-26 17:46:55


only if the integration uses a key management scheme which leverages on TrustZone **and** a side channel resistant implementation **and** JTAG disabled - otherwise it's pretty much the same thing as an external Linux computer.

You get two attack vectors on paper wallets.
The first one when you create it - if the random generator used is somewhat flawed, your key can be compromised. Mycelium entropy was created to solve that. 
The second one when you decide to actually use it - if the computer on which you sweep the paper wallet is compromised, the private key can be lost. Hardware wallets were created to solve that.
@_date: 2015-09-20 06:41:37
yes, with minor restrictions - the Open Source version does not implement [NXP proprietary APIs]( and thus will perform more slowly (also Mycelium is missing some code to handle that transparently but that'll be added soon)

unfortunately not.

nope. Any suggestion to do that ? 


It comes from /dev/urandom on a linux system (actually from python mnemonic calling that). 




That's a very valid suggestion, it could be added in a future version. It's just not done for the time being because an isolated OS is good enough and the library for mnemonic generation just does that.

yeah well it's true the question asked could use some improvement regarding the attack scenarios and resources of the attackers.
- someone found your wallet on your desk and wants to trace it while you're out for 2 minutes : PIN is enough
- someone can borrow your wallet for some time : PIN and hardware protection are recommended or a passphrase
- someone can install malware on your computer : good luck
- someone wants to get your public addresses at gunpoint : passphrase can help
- someone wants to get your public address at gunpoint and knows approximately how many bitcoins you own or one of the addresses : good luck

My personal opinion on this topic is that those architectures never really evolved - when open smartcard platforms where introduced around 2000, symmetric encryption was the easiest way (for the chip) to make sure you could embed secrets in your code and send it from the producer to the consumer, so it sticked around, as there was never a need for the consumer to audit that code.
In the end different people decide what could be the best hardware architecture to design Bitcoin related applications, and we're left with one tough decision to make at some point : consider if physical security is an issue or not. 
If it's not, and we don't care if the chip secrets can be obtained in a few minutes, because multisignature or whatnot, then it's fine to keep working on generic purpose hardware (which might also pretty well be backdoored - it's also running secret microcode most of the time after all)
If it is, then we can either design our own hardware to deal with that (and consider all R&amp;D costs and hidden costs, for example that [a whole class of side channel attacks countermeasures are patented]( or use existing hardware and software combination protecting against that and follow the rules that come with it.
To be honest, I don't really care about Trusted Computing on desktop platforms - I can always connect a dongle there, or use my phone, and end up with something more open and more portable. I got interested in the TEE for mobile platforms because of the convenience it provides - it's close to a direct access to TrustZone (I'd love to see an open phone platform offering that direct access of course), it protects significantly well against physical attacks on a device that's easy to steal (if implemented properly), it provides more protections against malware than what mobile platforms offer today, and enough space to be creative if I believe the code could be compromised by the provisioning party.


ok, that's weird. So far, nobody yelled at my suggestions, so we'll move forward and see what happens. It's not as if our entire business model was based on the TEE anyway.
@_date: 2015-09-19 07:11:11
it probably supports BLE, so there's still hope for our next product line
@_date: 2015-09-01 06:26:07
Actually that works better when you haven't been running for 6 years with an ecosystem worth billions in fiat.
@_date: 2015-09-18 15:43:42
Yes, it can be safely kept in your back pocket. It's waterproof. Bending is a bit more complicated, I'd say like a regular NFC credit card - you don't want to break the antenna.
@_date: 2015-09-18 23:23:30
One simple way would be to install [NFC Tag Info]( tap a contactless card and see what happens - if you tap an old card and get an error saying the Mifare Classic is not supported, it's ok though.
@_date: 2015-09-27 13:30:38
encrypted per chip, but that doesn't help much against an attacker with infinite skill and time I guess. The point is just to give you more than enough time to transfer your coins

While having a display helps, it is not a silver bullet either. It doesn't help against a malware changing the address before you read it, or [bugs]( obviously.

@_date: 2015-04-20 05:34:00


yes, [they have a specific DCS and PID]( 


It has full access to the SMS stored on the SIM (note that the phone can also store some/all SMS elsewhere), but to launch a SIM application directly you need to send those special messages - so everything happens in the baseband, before the phone OS is even notified about the SMS.


yes, it's quite exciting. [Bladox API]( was great, it's too bad nobody cared about this back in the days and now they're likely on life support. 


Most of the tools are proprietary, so the best option would probably be to shoot an email to [Bladox]( and see if you can get a TurboSIM. You could also try to ask [Taisys]( or [Watchdata]( for a development sample if they offer that (basically a Java Card with open keys) - then get used to Java Card, for example with [jcardsim]( However this one will miss the Sim Toolkit APIs, that you'll need to add. For that, [SIMtrace]( could help. Also the [ETSI standards](

It'd also prevent updates :) also I get the idea, but I don't really see how it could be done with off the shelf hardware, so any pointer would be appreciated (I mean yes, I could put a flash behind a microcontroller, but that's not really the point here)


Likely yes - if you have kernel level access there's no reason you shouldn't have one. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 06:38:47
Why ? They're totally different platforms. HW.1 is native code on a chip covered by NDAs, Unplugged is an application on top of an open Virtual Machine API (and the virtual machine is not open source either).
@_date: 2015-04-09 19:58:45
no problem. We plan to open source way more things soon enough, including a crypto library, and would appreciate the eyeballs :)

@_date: 2018-07-25 09:53:56
The bounty doesn't make any sense. It's basically saying that somebody will provision the seed into a hardware wallet, then delete it, then give you the device and ask you to recover it, which is obviously impossible. So this is just a marketing stunt.
A better bounty would be to evaluate how easy it is to modify the device behavior to leak data once it's entered by the user.
On a general design standpoint, I'd say this kind of "unhackable" device will likely end up generating more epic failures caused by weak entropy picked by the user rather than software or hardware hacks though.
@_date: 2015-04-22 09:25:07
Probably not this because he didn't mention TREZOR.
My point is that a software solution doing something similar will not offer the same transaction validation mechanism or involve a remote third party to try to do so.
@_date: 2015-04-20 05:01:03
No, I'm not at all involved in the project. I've just been doing stuff like that for about 15 years now, and had a good relationship with [the Czech open source / open hardware company that made those things popular]( so I think I can freely comment on the generic parts.


That'd be up to the authors to answer the first part - regarding the second part, SMS targeting the SIM are usually blocked from inside the network (a user cannot send such message to another user), so it makes sense to "bounce" to a server that can do that. It'd make sense to do something like this to request a payment from another user, then proceed.


MMS cannot be used from the SIM (and that'd also require data)


I'd just do a bouncer server that routes messages between users SIMs, then receives the signatures. But let's see what the actual architecture is :)
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:41:48


not quite. We do have a product to sell obviously, but we also believe that being able to provide a Hardware Wallet under $5  for large volumes is important for the ecosystem.
To do that, it's important to be able to bring more security to insecure devices. All current solutions manipulating addresses are flawed and attempts to make things better - having a screen doesn't help if the address you're paying to has been changed before you got a chance to read it. 
We plan to leverage on the Payment Protocol to create standard "trust islands", which will basically be payment requests that can be automatically validated by the hardware because they're coming from parties you accepted, based on a whitelist, which will provide better security than just a screen validation in my opinion.
Interested developers [can start playing with the alpha version right now](
 
Also, we'll bring the Trustlet version before Blue :)
@_date: 2015-09-22 21:24:34
yes, our new product (Blue) will feature that. Unplugged is more intended for easy and cheap manufacturing. You can reasonably port it on any recent Java Card platform
@_date: 2015-09-02 08:37:29
yep that's the one that'll need to be rebased with their recent changes
@_date: 2015-09-24 13:00:51
sure but that's the lesser of many evils for the very specific use case of interacting with an external device - other options involve downloading more or less native code to the user computer which is a security nightmare
@_date: 2015-09-26 23:07:39
yes, they were on preorder for some time.
@_date: 2015-04-20 05:43:16

More or less, there are Java Card implementations of Bitcoin Hardware Wallets already - [SatoChip]( and [our own]( which will soon be extended to provide functionalities similar to the [closed source Ledger Wallet API](
@_date: 2015-09-18 16:46:40
1) No. That's easy enough to add but not really practical as the key stretching will probably be longer than on HW.1, but I'll test and report for science
2) Yes, you can create your own Fidesmo account and load the OpenPGP applet over there. It might not fit on the card along wIth Ledger Unplugged though, but feel free to try and report
3) Yes definitely, likely as soon as next month for an alpha version

no it's a more simple concept, with NFC only. we discontinued the USB one to move on the Blue instead.

its screen is considerably larger and brighter than the ledger one
@_date: 2015-04-20 01:33:36
Nice - I've been playing with similar stuff for a while (with [Taisys] ( and [Bladox] ( that people might remember from the early iPhone days), so at least I can confirm that the technology is real :)
The main drawbacks from these things is that they're often quite fragile, complicated to adapt to multiple SIM slots, and a significant pain to talk to from high level applications (not an issue for feature phones obviously though)
@_date: 2015-04-09 20:05:24

@_date: 2015-04-21 17:41:17
As far as I can see, [only the Local Trader functionality is affected](

[Right there](


@_date: 2015-09-24 12:40:12
it's more complicated than this, you have to define what's a derivative work, and so on. TLDR if you want to force people to contribute back, pick another license (that's why we picked AGPL for Ledger Unplugged) - of course it's in the best interest of KeepKey to keep everything open, so there's no reason why they should close anything. Which also doesn't mean that everything can be used back in TREZOR (if only because the ST variant they picked has twice the flash memory size)

yes, Android (through Nano, Unplugged and TEE) and [recent Windows Phones with NFC Smartcard API support]( (Unplugged only) will be next, likely in a few weeks for the first beta
@_date: 2015-04-22 19:14:17
It also goes way beyond that - ultimately, open source or not, you trust your hardware. Going the last mile and actually analyzing what the hardware is doing is critically important.
@_date: 2015-04-25 05:16:15
You could use it ([if it's an open version]( to play with Java Card hardware wallets - [SatoChip]( and [ours](
Also check the [Applet Playground]( for other possible use cases.
@_date: 2015-04-27 22:11:53
it's a design choice - we assume that the other party can provide a way to check what's getting signed
@_date: 2015-09-17 13:31:58


note that this problem has been addressed by the smartcard industry about 2 decades ago, with either isolated native Operating Systems such as [MultOS]( or virtual machines such as [Java Card]( The core concept is the same : you review the core code once, and know that everything plugged on top of it cannot mess up too much.
Now those concepts are not really applicable to Open Source projects so far, but who knows, maybe things will change faster than expected :)
@_date: 2015-09-22 23:36:22
great then, as long as there are no other limitations (e.g. if there's a hub, everybody can participate with bitcoins mined from any coinbase). I'll be happy to do fun stuff in this environment with something much smaller than a Raspberry Pi

I think it should be possible to ship it in the new smaller packaging which should almost make it fit in a small letter, but I'll be asking the team to see if it's possible to achieve something making it as small as the old HW.1 shipping process

Maybe NFC doesn't work that well on smaller form factors, but that's just a wild guess here.

Let's say it refers to the non interoperable parts of the [standard specification]( (basically application provisioning + extensions)


We plan to have an interpreter that doesn't allow to build arbitrary applications from scratch but let you play freely in a bitcoin sandbox. We'll be moving forward with that and making more announcements in the coming weeks.

sorry, we have too many devices :) 
also Unplugged should work with recent Windows Phones, Copay should be the first use case for that.

yup, and many other unknown threat models so far (malicious wifi hotspot, malicious update, ...)
@_date: 2015-04-20 14:42:03
keep in mind that NFC Card Emulation and NFC Reader/Peer to Peer are totally different beasts - you can do Card Emulation with smartcard hardware and no power, you need an external radio and power for Reader/Peer to Peer. So it works well for sim-to-bigger-phone payment, not for sim-to-sim payment
@_date: 2015-09-23 16:41:52
well it's easy enough to add support for TREZOR when Ledger is supported, and the other way round. The most complicated part is to split the code to support external key generation and signing.
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:09:23
It's normal. This is some kind of grease coming from the upper internal side of the box, which when pressed on the swivel cover during transportation does some transfer and looks like fat fingers had touched the device.
@_date: 2016-10-05 05:47:55
it should work, I'll have a look at it later
EDIT : forgot that it's not compatible with the current firmware in default signing mode, only in multisig. I'll see if it makes more sense to make it compatible or to release the beta firmware.
@_date: 2015-04-26 18:22:51
As usual, you have to think about the risks, the attack vectors, and act accordingly.

@_date: 2017-10-14 13:14:26
They were possibly too low. We're tracing an issue with the fee estimation when the mempool size fluctuates too quickly. It'll likely be confirmed shortly as the queue is shrinking significantly during week-ends, but otherwise you'll be able to double spend it once it disappears from our nodes (which usually takes a couple days)
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:56:44
there are different possible strategies to split even without replay protection - such as  or adding UTXOs only valid in a single chain to a transaction.
In the end not having replay protection is just a hassle but won't prevent the market from expressing itself.
@_date: 2017-10-11 05:36:39
Yes, just an unfortunate coincidence here
@_date: 2015-09-23 17:44:26
Sorry, fixed (and hopefully not too many people will bug you for AT native support)
@_date: 2016-10-23 06:42:43


do you have any example we could use to make it better ?


from my personal experience security related code is hard to review, embedded code is hard to review, and security embedded code makes that square, so unfortunately I wouldn't bet on having that many reviewers for both. We plan to have a first professional review made in 2017 and our code is also much faster to review considering you can check each application separately.
@_date: 2015-09-17 15:23:35
Yes, both are over F(p) so it's very likely just about changing a few constants.
@_date: 2015-09-18 20:53:17

@_date: 2016-10-16 13:00:34
well the[ scalability roadmap]( can hardly be considered as doing nothing, and even if it didn't exist, doing nothing would still be better than handling the future of Bitcoin as a censorship resistant exchange protocol to the miners and Sybil.

Which other solution would you suggest today to do that ? 
(fair warning, it's a tricky question)
@_date: 2015-04-30 16:43:08


It's slightly different but leads to the same conclusion on every smartcard provisioning system I've seen so far : you submit an encrypted binary, which is sent to the chip over a transport key that you don't control. So in the end you don't know what the chip is running, and have to trust that the conversion chain is run automatically.


Which is surprising because they seem to [also have some kind of scripting language](




@_date: 2016-10-24 05:50:01
the team will be looking at it, but so far most people run it without issues (and it's not really related to either the device code or typical operation process)

yes, we already did it with Ledger Unplugged - you can grab the source code to have a look and install it on any compatible Java Card at 
@_date: 2016-10-26 05:55:45
FWIW it seems fees have been pushed up for small transactions that wouldn't require it in the past few days, not unrelated to the peak of the spam attacks last year. Maybe someone has a graph handy, paging @_date: 2016-10-23 09:56:23
you could even delete the BTC app while in the plane and reinstall it after - no data lost since all keys are derived from the main seed.

For whatever you use Bitcoin in real life for :)
@_date: 2015-09-04 13:34:28
No (both for technical reasons and Betteridge) 


Problem here is reading the information - if you want to provide that information to other public users, it has to be readable. If it can be read, it can be copied. If it can be copied, it can be leaked.

@_date: 2016-10-27 22:59:45


it's not a hardware wallet - it's a full node in a (maybe) nice box, a bit too light on the technical specifications to have an opinion. 
@_date: 2016-10-16 08:43:02


yes, I think this highlights the fact that users have different expectations for Ethereum. If Bitcoin loses its stability, it would pretty much lose all its value proposal to me - why not move to Ethereum then.
@_date: 2016-10-16 07:34:06


Keeping the network up and running is the  priority. If you have no network, you can't do anything else. This is why security concerns should always be considered first, and this is usually better done by hardcoded limits and touching critical layers as little as possible rather than by listening to The Market (c), flocks of migratory birds and 
@_date: 2015-04-22 08:50:40
Both are fully independent. The seed can be used to recover the wallet on a different Ledger Wallet device, a TREZOR or on a compatible BIP 44 enabled software wallet (Mycelium / Multibit HD)

If you're using the default Connect configuration, you fetch some script from Satoshilabs github account, like every other Connect user, which makes it as risky as an ad server (regarding the number of users that can be compromised from a single hack)

yes, HW.1 and Nano run the same firmware on the same hardware. Starter is a convenient way to set them up securely but alternatively you can burn the image yourself (see  also this offline setup mechanism will not be necessary with the upcoming firmware version. Unplugged offers similar functionalities but over NFC, so mostly limited to smartphones offering this technology.

thanks :)
@_date: 2016-10-13 22:47:17


unfortunately by building a system on a non specialized chip, you have to trust every actor that could have touched the chip in the distribution chain from the chip issuer to everyone that could physically access it. So that's quite the opposite.
If you doubt that statement, I'd invite you to reflash your TREZOR firmware from my laptop next time you see me in a conference :)

malware, reported.
@_date: 2015-11-09 19:05:22
No clue about a specific reason, but it looks like a version mismatch between Armory and the latest Bitcoin Core APIs. According to the error message changing 
    conf = cppUtxo.getNumConfirm(TheBDM.getTopBlockHeight())
    conf = cppUtxo.getNumConfirm()    
should fix it (or do it in the C binding - you get the idea) - although more things are likely to break later.

user base is a baseless concept for a pseudonymous currency
in case it wasn't clear the first time : you can't count Bitcoin users so stating that you need bigger blocks because you need more users isn't a very healthy start
@_date: 2015-09-19 00:32:11
yes, I think that could work for some implementations, either by writing some data to the flash or by harvesting energy before to keep the chip sleeping. Probably not easily done for the Secure Elements we are targeting though, and a malware could force the transaction the next time you tap depending on the implementation.

@_date: 2016-10-04 08:08:09
ORWL is as online as you want it to be - typically it can be used to operate a minimal signing service which will also enforce velocity checks and destroy the keys when moved or opened. It is a huge improvement over a vanilla server and a nice improvement over proprietary Hardware Security Modules which are pretty much the only other way to do that today.
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:26:54
you can directly update to 1.4.2. If you're updating from 1.3.0 or above you won't need to enter your mnemonic seed again, but will need to enter it if you update from a previous firmware version.
@_date: 2015-11-14 20:58:35
As far as I understand you'd still need HCE, supposing the card is a virtual prepaid card with instant top up. Holding a copy of that card (or another account linked to it) on a cheap external device could still be interesting in my opinion, typically when the phone is out of battery or doesn't support HCE.
@_date: 2016-10-19 04:02:57
yes, it's not that hard, and that's only necessary for firmware updates, not application updates. We don't expect to have that many firmware updates.

The seed is restorable without the security card QR code. 
Each dongle is bound to the security card until the firmware is reloaded (for the time being), then you have to bind it again.
[Developers can also provide their own security card]( without reflashing, even if nothing supports it yet. 
Also would be a better place for that.
@_date: 2015-11-29 18:24:21
the tricky thing is that you still have to check the validity of the certificate (some scammer could have a root called "X Bitcoin" instead of "X" for example - pinpointing some well known sites on the device might help with that though) and of course more people have to use it.
@_date: 2015-11-09 17:48:28
Despite our best efforts we're still human and sometimes a ticket can skip through (even if I don't see a single one unanswered so far in our interface). If you can resend your ticket, that should help understanding what happened and hopefully improve it. 
Regarding the instability of the wallet app, opening a new ticket or describing the problem more precisely should also help fixing it.

The most important property for me is the anti-censorship, and of course the decentralization that enables it. That's the price worth paying against centralized systems or private blockchains that otherwise perform better / faster / cheaper.

the point is to use it with velocity controls, similar to what was described in

That weakness is not really new - reminding me of 
@_date: 2016-10-16 06:59:25


SE are designed to keep secrets. When we manufacture the device, we create a private key for each device and sign it with an issuer key. You can verify that the device you receive contains this signed key, ensuring that it's not a clone. We provided more information about a previous version of that scheme in our blog post  at 


This is also acceptable, as long as you don't care about physical attacks being performed later on that chip. Also that's not what hardware wallet companies selling security products based on MCUs do ... 
@_date: 2015-09-18 23:28:47
We decided to skip that - I mean, the technology is interesting, but the UX would in my opinion look weird in order to be able to power the device and read the screen at the same time.
@_date: 2015-11-29 17:55:23
thanks. And yes, everybody (including us) has the same problem, so I'm pretty straightforward about it. Supporting the Payment Protocol (BIP 70) would strongly mitigate the issue when sending a transaction to a remote party supporting it.
@_date: 2016-10-13 12:46:13


considering he wants to destroy Bitcoin, that should be a little bit worrying.


so, what's the conflict of interest here ? Blockstream business model is to [build private blockchains on top of Bitcoin]( If Bitcoin is destroyed, everybody loses (including other unrelated private blockchains considering it's a pretty new area of interest)

no, each device supports a single seed

@_date: 2017-05-20 17:05:43
The Blue has a bit more space (I'd say likely 30% available to the user) but it'll get better in the future : all Bitcoin alts will be handled by the same applications, additional optimizations will be applied, the I/O code will be refactored to be smaller and so on and so on. 
Also note that you never dump anything : you just delete an application temporarily then reinstall it when you need it - the keys are still in the device.
@_date: 2015-11-29 22:42:59
so far you can't pay directly in a coffee shop on a terminal (you still have to use it with a wallet application on your phone, along with the security card), but that's something that will likely be added later. Also it'd be possible to add some specific scenarios that don't need the security card (for given addresses, pre programmed maximum amount ...)
@_date: 2016-10-27 06:24:52
even when you post arguments, you're still getting downvoted, and/or insulted, and/or threatened (along with your business because it's apparently forbidden to have a personal opinion in the safe haven for free speech).

there shouldn't be but positioning the card can be a bit tricky - when in trouble you can try to put it on a flat surface and the phone on top of it to see if it works better (and from there try to find out the best location)

the only difference should be the case, and we'll ship a new case to developer units owners when it is finished

@_date: 2015-04-18 18:04:16


Not really. Certification of the chip, certification of the software running on it, and certification of the full solution are actually three different things.
In an ideal world, I'd like to run auditable, open source code (also, probably non certified, because of the cost and time issues as you said), on certified chips (so that I know that the hardware provides some ways to protect against physical attacks).
As this is not yet doable as far as I know, you have to compromise. Running auditable, open source code on a non secure chip is a way (TREZOR). Running auditable by specifications code on a secure chip is another way (Ledger Nano). Having open source auditable code on a non secure chip and auditable by specifications code on a secure chip is another way (future Ledger hardware). Having open source auditable code on a non secure chip and delegating some cryptographic functionalities to a dedicated chip is another way (you).
Hope it makes more sense now. Of course I'm slightly biased towards the designs I picked, because I picked them for valid reasons.

let's make it easier and please provide a signed message from Satoshi confirming he agrees that the network didn't change in 6 years.
@_date: 2015-11-17 20:57:39


yes in the default configuration (the one we will officially support)


it's closed specifications so a very large part of the secure element code will be open sourced and there will be an encrypted binary blob for the remaining part 


yes, but this firmware will have to call closed source service calls for a few APIs.


The main advantage is to be able to debug the running code directly on the target. Also to flash whatever you want and always be able to recover (provided that code didn't disable JTAG). Native JTAG will only be for the microcontroller, the secure element might expose some kind of "soft JTAG" if we manage to do it.


The non secure microcontroller will be fully open and reflashable with no bootloader


This. Blue security model will be slightly exotic as you can guess :)


They could still do it for developers unit if users specifically ask for it, even if it might be a burden on the production line. If I were doing it, I'd keep a few 100s units on the side for that though.


Apps will be first developed in C and then (probably later) support a Fidesmo-like VM.


No, but there is another Blue-like device that's still to be unveiled. This Blue (the one we're currently talking about) is our true vision though.


It's way faster than the Nano (I clocked a BLE exchange + signature in around 30 ms), and way slower than a HSM (which doesn't really matter since the main task of the HSM is to perform a large number of unrelated signing operations per second)


No, but you'll be able to prove that it was done the way it was supposed to be done. I'll let you think about that :)


We might be able to run PBKDF with more reasonable timings on that one. Didn't benchmark it yet though.


No, but there'll be more than enough space on the Secure Element for a third party application to support it


It will not support Java Card, only native applications first, then a close relative of Java Card, still not binary or source compatible with it (mostly for licensing reasons)


That wouldn't be recommended. It's much, much faster than Nano, but still way slower than your common general purpose computer.

yes, the hardware is basically authenticated by proving that it owns a unique private key which is hard to copy because it's stored in a Secure Element, signed by Ledger during the production process. Then you can visually check that the hardware hasn't been modified by an attacker adding a chip in the middle. The whole process is described at

we're discussing it. One immediate fix would be to move everything to RBF but that requires some additional work to offer a nice bumping UI next to it.

You can verify from [our sources on github]( and the [card protocol specification]( that :
* the seed is generated and sent to Ledger Wallet without being kept or transferred
* there is no covert channel in the protocol specification that gives to Ledger Wallet an opportunity to leak information about the generated keys
* the clients only use protocol commands described in the protocol specification
Those 3 elements considered together should help convincing you that there is no usable backdoor in the system.

Open microcontrollers are also impossible to audit. A major difference between both is that secure microcontrollers are actually tested and you can point to the report of the testing lab to see to which extent they were actually tested.
If you need hardware which is resistant against physical attacks today, there isn't any other option. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 05:09:38
it's interesting to experiment with - for the time being, there are not many devices supporting it though, and its actual security may vary depending of the implementation. 
If you want to play with Ledger implementation, we have [a beta]( still running for a few weeks with Mycelium and Greenbits, grab it while it's free :) There'll be an SDK available to let people mod it shortly.

* The one initiated by Bitpay, on the currently deployed Ingenico terminals - slightly complex to deploy on existing terminals, with some former comments from BitPay here 
* The one initiated by Paymium, which works on the newly deployed terminals, as an application in a private Ingenico App Store. Supposedly easier to deploy, but with less coverage so far.

great, that's even worse. That's the job of the wallet in the first place, not of the website. You provide a consistent user experience on all present and future platforms by delegating payments to the entity supposed to be handling them.
@_date: 2015-11-29 21:17:16
The sender generates a Payment Request including the payment amount and address, other metadatas (such as a return address), then signs it. You can then check the certificate chain on the receiving end to make sure that the sender is legitimate as you would do with a regular PKI and TLS certificates, then extract the address and amount being sure they weren't tampered with. If you perform that check on the hardware wallet itself and manage to find a reliable way to check the certificate issuer, you can have end to end security for every use cases.
@_date: 2015-11-08 02:29:54
Damn, they were serious about that software migration
@_date: 2015-03-25 05:43:28
no, people could spend a few minutes with a very simple and cheap glitching setup to do that though. Or just install a vulnerable firmware version and hope the end user wouldn't notice. Or just replace the Trezor by a similar looking device. You have plenty of options to attack something that's not designed to hold secrets in the first place.
@_date: 2015-11-02 21:17:19


It's really a mixed bag. I've also seen worse things IRL :)


If we had that, I think that applying it to politics might be a higher priority for the greater good.


He's probably just doing CEO things, and getting his news from other people in his team who have a narrow focus because of limited time, resources or projects pressure. For a company focused on transactions, scaling would only mean getting a bigger volume without considering other more complex ways to reach the goal. Bitcoin spectrum is extremely broad so it's unfortunate but really not surprising.


I'd just say that you don't share the same concerns and time to market.


I'm convinced that people are working hard on different scaling proposals and that it'll converge at some point (not necessarily right after Hong Kong), the bigger risk being those people ending up burned out by the constant bickering in my opinion. I'd also argue that at least one of them is past this point already.

@_date: 2015-11-25 07:09:26
GreenAddress has been supporting TREZOR for 2 of 2 and 2 of 3 schemes for quite a long time. It was actually the first wallet to support it for multisignature purposes.
@_date: 2017-05-18 04:59:53
and those transaction graphs are typically well chosen to increase fees for everybody, so yes, it's an attack
@_date: 2015-11-23 13:49:40
It's hard to find some good references, so I'd suggest to have a look at different hacker conference presentations. For example [that one]( describes the specific hardware security features you'll find in a typical secure element.

Sure, depending who's driving the price

In my opinion there's little benefit to use a hardware 2fa that's not bitcoin-aware. If you have a Yubikey Neo with [open keys]( you can turn it into a Bitcoin hardware wallet with [our (Ledger) Open Source application]( though.

UAF is more suitable for this use case, but FIDO definitely. The only thing left here is to define a BIP 44 mapping to the key generation mechanism, everything else is specified, peer reviewed, and not tied to a single vendor implementation. 
@_date: 2015-11-18 05:26:22


yes but through a software switch only for the time being


It's still not possible to open everything because the chip datasheet is still only available under NDA - so basically most of the firmware will be open sourced up to a small number of APIs abstracting those parts, so the minimal set of hidden code will include the bootloader and I/O


I think Jonas is working on a proxy concept to connect hardware wallets to Core, then it'll be simple to add an implementation for Blue (or any other Ledger product)
@_date: 2015-11-18 05:11:24
it's only a speed issue - I'll check how long it takes to stretch a mnemonic on ST31
@_date: 2015-11-23 17:19:50


I think it still doesn't


Not really, we're testing with different providers and will update with performance reports when we can. It'll offer the same API and Open Source extensions as Blue.


Yes, that's because we use the Trusted UI feature which is only supported on Exynos CPUs due to Trustonic (non) agreements with Qualcomm I guess. If you want to only use it to secure private keys (with no user interface) any version can be used, starting from the Galaxy S3. We'll have a TEE update soon to support the Blue APIs and programming model.
@_date: 2016-10-22 20:54:47
not directly but a third party application on device could do that
@_date: 2016-10-28 04:48:10
Also it's important to note that the hard part of supporting RBF in a wallet is the bumping logic and its associated user experience, If you want to deploy it in a 2 stage scenario like we'll do (first make your transactions replaceable, then add the logic to actually replace them - which can be done as a CLI tool or through another wallet in the meantime) you just need to associate a lower (0xfffffffd instead of the default 0xffffffff) sequence number to your inputs. 
@_date: 2015-11-17 21:26:39
Noted, we should make it more clear that it was published on Ledger blog. Apologies about that. The concepts are still quite portable though, and it was meant to explain the thought process that led to the creation of that device.

Speaking with my interoperability concerned hat rather than my "competitor" hat, I'm worried about services relying on vendor specific APIs for general purposes use cases that should be handled by the Bitcoin wallets, such as a payment.
I fail to see what's the benefit. This introduces additional trust points and centralization that are, in my opinion, not worth the added value compared to a generic standard and interoperable [BIP-21]( URL handling.

@_date: 2015-11-03 08:02:35
yes, sorry about that, I never used the tool myself so I figured it wouldn't have this limitation. 
To recover, you'll need all public keys used to generate the multisignature address in order to build the redeem script. Then you can build a transaction manually - a pretty painful process
You can find an example of the process on  "P2SH transactions" but it'd definitely need a better tutorial
@_date: 2015-11-27 13:56:33
Of course it's the same thing for you because you're in the target audience right now. But interoperability is about guaranteeing an equal playing field for all actors and future proof integrations. This is what BIP21 achieves, and what Connect breaks in this use case.

@_date: 2015-03-31 16:07:49
The single chip we use (ST23YT66) is very likely the cheapest on the market, because it's very old and weird to use. The packaging (wafer) of the chip is also quite optimized.
TLDR try to guess our production costs right before doing that, but you might get surprised :)
@_date: 2015-03-05 06:35:31
A M of N multisignature with M keys held by insecure devices owned by the same party is not a proper security solution - compromising the M keys will still compromise everything permanently.
Then you can add usability issues on top of that (signers have to sign automatically, transaction data has to be shared in an unmodified way across signers, it's more complicated to create backups, ...)
@_date: 2015-11-18 05:30:41
we don't support it on Nano / Unplugged because stretching the mnemonic is way too slow on those devices

@_date: 2015-10-25 21:00:52
ok, I'm glad to see you've already established a business relationship with them - if they're aware of it and the specific risks it'll definitely make things easier.
Regarding 0 confirmations, it typically depends of the environment. For example during the malleability attacks, accepting 0 confirmations would have meant that you could pretty much have lost money on each transaction. It's also a tempting target for spammers in my opinion, so they could specifically attack the service.
also thanks for offering the service - just make sure you don't get burnt too much in the process.

@_date: 2015-11-01 16:50:59


Definitely. I'll post here when I get a better idea of when it should be available.
Regarding fungability/privacy, all our next products will feature an interesting SDK that let people install their own applications on the device dynamically and without compromising the core wallet security (all applications will be isolated, guaranteed by hardware features), so I hope that we'll be among the first to support those features in the most secure way possible. Of course that still requires some integration on the client side, but it makes things way easier.


It is totally doable - that's why we picked this architecture in the first place and will keep supporting it, nothing can scale better with volumes. For some almost worthy comparison, a typical low end SIM card is produced and shipped for about 0.1$ today (for several 10x millions). I definitely hope that we'll reach those volumes and enable the use cases you're considering.


Not yet and yes, we're working on it. The whole malleability episode was quite convincing to move towards that model. Any scalable/tested solution working in a Chrome app is very welcome btw.

For those who don't check comments on Discus 


Ledger CTO here.
Unfortunately, it's slightly more complicated than that. There's absolutely nothing in common between the performance of card emulation mode (used by Android Pay - the phone fakes being a card), and card reading mode (used here - the phone actually reads the card).
As I mentioned we did not have the opportunity to test on a 6P yet, but it works pretty well on older flagships (such as the Nexus 5), and pretty much all the recent Samsung range. From your results, I'd also argue that it's still usable on a 6P.
However we are in the process of compiling results from our users and provide a list of the best suited phones, and happily refund users that experience too many problems. I'm still pretty convinced that Unplugged along with our partner Fidesmo provides an unrivaled experience for people interested in customizable security and privacy applications.

No. This requires being able to verify a signature. You can do it offline and verify everything independently (both signature and attestation key).

My point exactly. What if everyone else starts doing that ? Pay with KeepKey. Pay with Coolbitx. Pay with Ledger. Pay with Mycelium. Pay with REDACTED. Pay with Coinbase.
I'm sure everyone has a very good reason to believe that's more convenient than following a standard, which is paying with a wallet. Where do we stop ?
@_date: 2017-05-08 12:43:07
we have no workaround so far - we need to be able to reproduce it to understand the issue.

Did you have similar issues when personalizing the card through the Ledger Wallet application first ? 
@_date: 2015-03-25 00:59:28
so hopefully you initialized it with a passphrase :)
@_date: 2017-05-12 06:16:34
(Disclaimer : I'm Ledger CTO) 
The Ledger platform let you install applications you designed (or other people designed) on the fly, without compromising other applications already running on the device - this makes it extremely flexible for new cryptocurrencies, or generic security use cases (for example you can find an [OpenPGP smartcard application]( a [password generator]( that types like a keyboard, a [Windows Hello]( companion for logging in and securing your workstation, and many more coming)
Ledger is the only open platform on the market architectured around a Secure Element, which allows us to [guarantee the integrity of the device you receive]( or to demonstrate to a remote party that [your applications runs in a well known environment]( - which can be leveraged for multiple use cases, such as [decentralized oracles](
@_date: 2016-10-18 16:16:26
yes, in a slightly different way (you can't associate it to a PIN and you can't use it for all applications since their UX might not be aware of the additional passphrase on TREZOR)

Not really. There could be some additional authentication protocol that prevents it from working properly on non Apple devices, for example. Here the protocol is clearly documented and it'll only take a few hours to port an existing wallet already supporting a Ledger product, which will typically the case as soon as Copay adds support for Ledger Unplugged to Windows Phone (and we've already been talking to them about that and offering to help)

The major difference being that bank transfers can be reversed.
Anyway the problem exists and there are ways to mitigate it, which is the important part of the discussion.
@_date: 2015-10-19 05:07:16


we did it to provide some straightforward solution until the next firmware is validated (and also for Unplugged) - then you'll be able to generate a [swapped mnemonic]( directly on the device.


why a late model ? It should work with pretty much [any Android]( there is also an iPhone  version available, and nothing preventing people from writing a Windows Phone version if they feel like doing it.

That's about why it's dangerous. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 20:33:16

@_date: 2016-05-16 02:34:39
yes, that's the plan (unless you like to gamble). Hardware wallets just hold keys and will do fine after a hard fork providing the transaction logic isn't changed
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:32:11
Unfortunately 2 mb + witness blocks is also potentially dangerous for the network.
@_date: 2015-10-19 01:19:45
1. Verify the randomness of what you generated.
2. Do not let anybody see the private key between 1 and 2.
3. Do not let anybody see the private key between 1 and 3, make sure the computer is not infected by malware, have an additional paper wallet ready to collect the change.
Now we can move to the fun parts of the tutorial.

Also for more explanations on the technical side see  especially "How does the TEE fit into the security infrastructure of a smartphone?"
Of course the telecom industry being the telecom industry, it's messy - not all phones have a TEE, different TEEs from different vendors support different features, some TEEs end up running on top of a competitor OS which doesn't really make things easier, everybody wants the biggest piece of the pie so the provisioning part of TEE applications is still proprietary, and so on.
Android M tries to push gently for more standardization, but there's still a lot of work to be done.

yes, it'll be possible to enter a private key directly into the Ledger Blue application (maybe not right at the beginning, but soonish enough) - the complex part to handle that properly in a Hardware Wallet is that you need to have some kind of user interface / camera / NFC reader / whatever to let you feed a WIF key directly into the device. 
Note that you could do it with KeepKey / TREZOR cycling through every single letter of the key, but it wouldn't be very enjoyable.

Considering the investments made in Bitcoin, I believe that a more likely scenario if Bitcoin doesn't scale is that it will turn into a "for companies only" private blockchains trend and users will quickly forget about cryptocurrencies in general after having been burned, until the next innovation in that space appears in a couple years.

Worst case scenario the wallets UX will just get more transparent for the user regarding proper fee selection, smart bumping (through Replace By Fee on the sending side / Child Pay For Parent on the receiving side), or routing to upper layers. This is really a non issue for the users, have fun and enjoy the moon.
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:34:28
technically yes, at a price considerably more expensive than any other general purpose technology. Also considering those technologies are already used by governments (typically by banks and for passports), it might be a good deterrent against that.
@_date: 2016-10-26 19:33:32
it's not a very good attack vector, nothing has been broken. 
@_date: 2015-10-18 18:31:34
No, Mycelium won't work either if the server goes down, but they're working on an SPV version (as is GreenBits, the "lighter" version of GreenAddress)
Another useful feature of GreenAddress is its detailed second factor to confirm your transactions - typically you can initiate a transaction on desktop and receive a SMS on mobile to review then authorize it, making sure that no malware in the middle changed anything.
@_date: 2015-10-14 13:21:36
Do you understand how they're using the ledger ? I never really got their proof of reserve protocols.
@_date: 2015-10-18 14:52:47
yes it would affect you when you sign transactions and want to broadcast them - but it could also be fixed before they're actually sent on the network with some additional work, so you don't have to update right away if you don't feel confortable with it.
Updating should be simple, just make sure that your seed is working and backup your wallet file in case something goes wrong because Electrum will convert it on first launch to a new format which is not compatible with the previous release.
@_date: 2015-10-17 02:50:59
yes there is. Asking the team that prepared it. It'll probably be offered later.
@_date: 2015-10-18 18:32:38
GreenAddress also supports all TREZOR-based hardware wallets (B-Wallet, E-Wallet, KeepKey and TREZOR so far)
@_date: 2015-10-26 13:06:30
No, but it's still possible to have a targeted attack against all Hardware Wallets today, that'd change an address before you can verify it.
I provided additional details about that over there 
@_date: 2015-10-16 18:25:52
But apparently it's still good to remind people about that, had another real life proof today :)
@_date: 2015-10-26 12:47:18
I'm sorry but you don't really understand the security model correctly - first having a screen definitely doesn't protect you against attacks where the address is changed before you have a chance to verify it, so claiming that TREZOR cannot be attacked by malware is definitely a fallacy for sure.
To attack our second factor scheme (when using a phone) a malware would have to have infected both the phone and the computer, and still get access to both when the transaction is performed to synchronize the attack. 
For more information I suggest you read our specification more carefully -

Binaries have been updated to fix the Ledger connectivity issue as well. You can redownload them if it didn't work previously.
@_date: 2015-03-29 09:21:48
he, it isn't a competing device. I even think it'll go hand in hand with Hardware Wallets, relieving them of the burden of properly generating entropy which is only used once if the wallet does things properly.
that being said, it's complicated to verify that a pre-manufactured hardware product has not been intercepted and modified. The current Ledger implementation is easy enough to check, because we have a single chip that happens to be good at keeping secrets. 
On a more complex product, you'd want to : 
- check that the firmware has not been tampered with (you can do that with different signature methods, depending on what the vendor did, and/or ideally reflash generic chips over JTAG)
- check that the chips match the Bill Of Material of the device (it's a shame to have attestation methods if a chip in the middle is just proxying the attestation and lying on everything else)
- check that the chips themselves are original versions (who knows, there might be a secret NSA factory on the dark side of the moon manufacturing ARM MCUs with microcode backdoors) 
Alternatively, you can also assume that this is a bit too much of a niche market to be the target of massive interdiction for the time being :)
@_date: 2016-05-17 05:29:06
it's a bad solution to a non existing problem, or maybe you need to fix something on Classic network protocol stack
@_date: 2015-11-09 02:04:30


yes. you'll have to pick TREZOR compatibility mode when doing so.


the private key still belongs to you so nothing changes. We'll push some notifications to our users in case weird things happen (such as the network oscillating between two forks) but in any case that shouldn't change anything as long as you're not sending a transaction.


you should always back it up on a non digital media and store it in a safe place. You never know what could happen - you could lose it anyway, it could be destroyed or stop functioning - hardware is not perfect. 


it cannot be done as easily for iPhone as Apple doesn't let people use generic USB devices on iOS (at least as far as I know, I should recheck their policy from time to time). We plan to offer another wallet supporting Bluetooth Low Energy connectivity that will work with Android &amp; iPhone though, but will be significantly more expensive (and the commercial release is scheduled for Q2 2016)

In the meantime a suggestion could be to use a throwaway e-mail (such as [Mailinator]( or if you're using Google Mail [rely on an alias]( so you can filter things more precisely, and know who's leaking your address (doesn't help against an actual malicious operator that'll filter the alias though)
@_date: 2017-05-20 09:33:14


That's a much better question, and the answer to that is yes, in some shape or form (maybe offering degraded functionalities initially, such as no account metadata, but that's still difficult to assess right now because we're in the middle of a full application redesign). In any case it'll always work pretty well with Electrum.
@_date: 2015-10-05 20:38:11


more than essentially, it uses exactly the same kind of chip (with an additional USB interface). But an existing one is hard to repurpose by design, otherwise it wouldn't be a very successful secure element.
@_date: 2015-10-30 05:28:55
For bitcoin related purposes and elliptic curves operations, the code is definitely not bad regarding side channel attacks compared to a lot of other open source libraries, but the licence is pretty horrible ("look only for 90 days"), there are multiple preprocessor conditions making it difficult to know what's exactly running on the target, there is no processor specific optimization, and it lacks deterministic signing.
TLDR : definitely keep using [libsecp256k1](

We made a flexible platform to let developers add their altcoins easily and can help when they're stuck.

The one which is more tested against the specific threat which is being considered. If the device is easy enough to reflash during any point of the distribution and the end user is unable to verify/prove what's running into it, being open source doesn't help much. But time will tell I guess, at least it's a slightly more interesting target than an STM32 :)

yes, even if CAs are evolving significantly towards a model where light checks (proof of ownership of an e-mail address or a domain) will always be an option, following the Let's Encrypt initiative. One could for example imagine doing that against a Tor service for extra privacy.
@_date: 2015-11-29 16:20:04
you can't do that if it's the first time you see this address (typically in a check out process in an online store)
@_date: 2015-03-25 00:27:40
Sure - you provide a random value to the chip, and it answers with a signature of the firmware version + the random value, using a private key shared by some batches. 
So far the Ledger Wallet Chrome application does it internally, but we'll provide a web page and tools to let the users do it so you can check that you're actually using a legitimate device.
@_date: 2016-10-16 13:08:48


there are currently many discussions to change it, even in very deep ways that'd actually make it scale by being less flexible, such as Mimblewimble. I'm quite fine with Bitcoin being a cockroach and Ethereum a peacock, to paraphrase Andreas.


2 Mb maximum blocks have never been a technical problem, but they don't bring much relief (especially when looking at Segwit) compared to the risks of stopping the network to implement a new policy and going in that direction because of a social mess (which is actually hard to quantify) would set quite a bad precedent.

"more tested" is debatable - we (Ledger) have a significantly more modular source code base and many third parties are tweaking some of the applications for their own public or private needs
@_date: 2015-10-10 23:52:01
We plan to release a different protocol for "one tap" (or such) payments a bit later - right now the protocol is basically a 1:1 clone of the USB protocol which is not designed for fast payments. There are several companies working on similar things, so we're evaluating the options and will pick those we like, offering an Open Source implementation that people can tweak. In my wildest dreams we'd end up having similar to [OneBit]( but on a card, with open gateways, and an Open Source card application, but we're not there yet.

It shouldn't be. First there's nothing indicating that the DDOS is persistent (nobody would be dumb enough to do that I guess), and even if it was, even if I sound like a broken record here, the only acceptable solution is to start up more individual nodes. As you can see in this thread, having somebody handle your nodes for you is not a good idea.

we won't support it in the current HW.1 or Unplugged because the stretching time is way too long on the current hardware. It~~'ll~~ should be a common feature of our next products though. We could do it right now in a proprietary, non interoperable way but I don't really see the point.

Unfortunately it's very likely impossible to get a constant time crypto library in Javascript or Java, which is key to avoid possibly leaking your secrets to anyone listening (to power variations or timings) in a close range.
Relying on anything else than a constant time (so, C is implied, with the compiler output being reviewed), crypto library for hardened key derivation or signature should be **very strongly discouraged**, and [libsecp256k1]( went through that kind of review.
Also the impact on the development team should be low - in the end it'll just be "call that magical signing blob over there" with an extra abstraction layer.

there is no copy of secret information - smartcards hold keys and sign things, since the 1980s. Do you think Satoshilabs came up with that idea ?
@_date: 2015-11-09 05:15:04


They cannot be traced if you don't provide the master public key to another service yourself. 


All private keys stay on the chip. The seed is generated on the computer for the current firmware version though, before being transferred to the chip, which only happens once and ideally in an offline or clean environment. With the upcoming firmware version the seed will be generated on the device itself.
@_date: 2015-11-09 02:15:55


Yes, but a different kind of worse. For example I think it could be interesting (but quite difficult) to simulate the orphan rate between several pools having the same hash power ratio than on mainnet and the same connectivity (re. geographic location and ISP) depending on the block size.

I believe that BitID will morph into an implementation of the [FIDO protocols]( (U2F, UAF, Fido 2.0) with a blockchain flavour. FIDO covers more ground ([many vendors to choose from]( [strong industry support]( coverage for many use cases and scenarios, typically how to use the authentication devices natively on many different hosts - the native Chrome support for USB HID devices used by many hardware wallets today actually comes from FIDO) and we (Ledger) are very strongly pushing in that direction.

it depends where it was modifed. If it was modified after being displayed to the user or obtained by the user, then it gives you a way to notice it abort the transaction. If it was modified before being presented to the user for the first time, then it won't allow you to notice it. Note that all other hardware wallets have the same limitation - a possible mitigation against those attacks is to push forward BIP 70 for everybody to verify transaction parameters end-to-end - we're working on that and a beta version is available with the current firmware for motivated developers.

Even controlling the signing code inside the TEE is quite important - otherwise it could happily sign using a non constant time/power implementation and leak data. 


The main difference here being that iOS had a single implementation to test. From my past experiences with other secure components integration on Android I expect the road to be slightly bumpy.
@_date: 2015-10-23 10:11:12
I would say that it's not designed to support it so far, mostly for UX concerns. In my opinion you could get something similar by requiring several authentication events and enforcing different public keys for each attempt in a common session.

it is by design considerably harder to tamper with a smartcard than with a generic microcontroller
@_date: 2016-05-02 02:17:56
I expect the integrations from different vendors to be quite interesting to test, seeing how the non generic Trustonic integration behaves.
The main difference here is that our implementation relies specifically on TEEs that can execute code, and we put all the transaction related logic in the enclave, as well as the UI whenever we can. The generic Marshmallow integration targets a broader scope of devices, with a smaller set of requirements. The nice part is that it's available for free for all wallets running on the Android platform.

you navigate to a website - you're presented with a payment to an address you have never seen before. This address is modified before it's displayed in the browser by a MITM malware.

is that the smartest thing you could say when you're shown a clear attack pattern ?
@_date: 2015-03-05 21:59:48




yes, additional derived addresses or BIP 44 accounts might not yet exist at the time of the attack, also it's more difficult to attack both devices at the same time (maintain a communication channel between both) to make sure that the displayed information is correct. This could be made even more difficult by making sure the host and the smartphone don't communicate (the message to verify could be scanned from a QR code from the phone in airplane mode, producing a confirmation code that the user would validate)


Thanks. The TEE version would also be worth a look (provided you got a phone that can run it - more details about that in the coming weeks)

@_date: 2016-05-23 05:52:34
The problems are rather complex and field testing has been disappointing - to sum it up, a significant number of phones don't provide a reliable enough field for complex use cases in reader mode NFC. The easiest way to solve that issue would be to fix it on the phones - it doesn't help much for devices already on the market, but more and more people and standard bodies are realizing that NFC interoperability is broken so it should get better soon. Alternatively a less complex card application would work better - native Java Card SHA-512 support should significantly improve things, but that's not something to consider for the cards we already issued (and I'm not sure there's a commercially available implementation for the general public right now). This leaves one last option which is to split the application logic into more independant blocks and hope that this will improve the reliability - it should help reducing the fail feedback loops between the phone stack timeouts / chip heating up and behaving differently / antenna pairings, but there's still a soft spot to find to avoid making the signing process significantly slower after the changes - so this is an ongoing process.
In the meantime you're welcome to send logs (adb logcat) of the process to support along with your phone model and any extra piece of information on the operating environment you can provide (do you have a cover on the phone ? how are you handling the card ? and so on) and we have no issues refunding orders when the user experience is not up to your expectations.
@_date: 2015-10-14 15:09:12

it'd make a difference - the antenna goes around the card (you can see it if you look at it in front of a bright light) and both antennas have to be coupled in an optimal way for the card to collect enough energy to perform the (expensive) cryptographic operations. The problem is that you usually don't know where the phone antenna is or how it's tuned, so it's a game of moving the card around and checking what happens. If you can report the best location and orientation on different phones that's definitely something that would go into our FAQ.

this program runs on the Nano S and will be included in our Manager application later, so it'll be signed by Ledger as well and be a one click download - that's one key difference of the Nano S compared to other hardware wallets : you can download and run trusted applications on it
@_date: 2015-10-27 04:29:04


no, it goes beyond that depending of the use case. As I said, if you consider paying to an address you've never seen before you have no way to be sure of anything. Of course that's not a TREZOR only issue.


As do everybody out there but Case ? 


You're encouraged to do the confirmation on a different computer when using that mode (see "or a different computer / smartphone, tablet with USB host support, depending on how confident you are about the first computer integrity")
Also the default mode was used for the original HW.1 deployment, and is now mostly available for developers.


yes it's a cost / security compromise, which is acceptable in my opinion.


I believe that if you care enough to print a new card you'll care enough to print it and install it on an offline computer.


No, I'm just saying that implementations of this protocol on a device offering a screen and buttons (such as the [Trustlet]( and Blue) do not support that mode. Why should I even talk about TREZOR in my protocol specification ?


Obviously, and one that you should not use much after pairing your card to a phone.


That is not the point ?


So you'd say that the second factor validation on a phone is not safer than the Security Card validation ? 


We're comparing convenience, security and price here. Equally safe doesn't mean anything out of context. Once set up with the phone validation option, I don't feel dishonest claiming that Ledger Nano offers a convenience and security balance similar to other solutions, and is considerably more secure against physical attacks. We can definitely improve the set up part, and we're quite actively working on it.


And if I had to secure thousands of euros in Bitcoins and I could risk losing my device and I didn't want to pick a hard to crack passphrase, I'd never put it on a generic microcontroller. Security is about balance and understanding risks, it's not black or white, and choosing this balance is a complex topic as you can see.
@_date: 2015-03-29 15:31:46


oh sure, but some people may actually want that. 


I think that the lesson learned would be to do it better next time. It's complicated enough to think about projected sales in bitcoin-land without considering random bumps along the way.


I think everyone is aware of that, just being the instantaneous pulse of the community, with the good and bad sides that go with it.

I talked to their team at [Cartes]( and have to confirm that it's quite nice - it's probably the first time someone designs an Open Hardware grid/shield that way. 
My only concern is with the main CPU - I'd rather have something supporting TrustZone (such as the i.MX used in [USB Armory]( to provide an additional safetey net against software attacks rather than a brand new Intel Skylake (which also probably support some kind of security extensions, but TrustZone is more open and field tested so far). However it's still an impressive achievement and I hope their campaign will succeed.

I posted something about that yesterday in the ~~ces~~other sub, guess I can repost with more details
The attacked technology is an enclave solution - the idea is to create a secure area into a general purpose area which is not secure. Skipping on the details of the many layers involved, the enclave logic is still fine and this is patchable - that's probably just Qualcomm failing at fuzzing as they did before, and allowing the non secure area to inject code into the secure area, which is of course bad, but just a high level implementation failure.
To summarize quickly the possible software attack vectors from more patchable to less patchable
* Attack the Key Manager Truslet implementation (maybe this is it, let's wait for the details)
* Attack the TEE / rich Secure OS API (maybe a mix of the previous + an elevation to that)
* Attack the lower layers of the Secure OS (related to secure boot and the root of trust)
* Attack the TZ integration on a specific CPU (patchable by CPU microcode update, all should support it nowadays)
* Attack the TZ implementation on a specific SoC integration (could or could not be patchable depending how much the integration failed - worst case scenario you bin "a few" devices)
* Attack the TZ isolation logic (that's basically game over and I don't think we'll see it considering TZ is pretty simple)
On a comparison with a hardware wallet based on a generic microcontroller
* The software attack surface is much better (smaller) for the hardware wallet, but just because it runs its own (small) code. As the code gets more complex and ultimately moves into independent applications, it'll be the opposite, as enclaves offer some hardware backing logic for the application isolation, which generic microcontrollers might not provide, and generic microcontrollers used in TREZOR/KeepKey &amp; friends today do not provide. So that's a moving target.
* The physical attack surface is roughly the same for both - they provide no specific countermeasures. The microcontroller is probably easier to attack because it's less complex than the multi-core chip on which an enclave typically runs, but that's a rough guess.

Paging doesn't work in the post text, and is a better subreddit to avoid cluttering the main one with specific product issues.
Just follow what the Manager is telling you to do, and delete all applications before running the update.
If the manager doesn't recognize your device, verify that you don't have multiple applications running at the same time. If that's not the case, close the manager and open it again. If it still doesn't work, try with a different USB port. If it still doesn't work, try with a different cable. Following that usually solves all connectivity problems.

Yes, this is a useful feature of Secure Elements - we know they're hard to tamper with, so having an attestation check (which doesn't compromise privacy) is a nice feature.

TrustZone is not a secure element ... it's a perfectly standard ARM extension.


How do you fix a hardware issue ? By downloading a new chip ? 


uh, what ? 
The STM32 is as proprietary as a Secure Element regarding its core security - typically the mechanism implementing the JTAG fuse protection is not described. The main difference between both is that Secure Elements are actually security tested and certified.
If generic microcontrollers were appropriate to store secrets, people would have done it a long time ago.
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:00:35
it doesn't help, it gives you an illusion that it's helping. An attacker could just repackage in a similar "tamper resistant" box after altering the content.

@_date: 2016-10-16 13:25:59
well, you can't verify that **any** chip you receive is not backdoored. So in the end it's a choice between an unsecure chip which is unfit for remote distribution, expensive and cannot withstand physical attacks properly, and might be backdoored (but actually there's not much need for it considering it's not designed to be used for secure applications anyway), or a secure chip which is specifically designed to be issued and operate in hostile environments, is cheap, and might be backdoored (but considering governments are using the very same chips, that might be a bit silly).

On a security point of view I'm more concerned by the "leakiness" of the crypto operations done in Javascript than the application speed - ultimately it'd be nice to delegate everything to the native OS (or even better the secp256k1 library, or a hardware wallet when available) through Cordova.

BIP 70 allows the sender to create a payment request, containing a digital signature of the addresses to pay to and of the amount. This scheme is vulnerable to typical PKI attacks (malware re-signing in the middle to a rogue certificate, users not validating who issued the certificate, and so on) that we reduce by having the dongle performing the validation against a limited set of authenticated CAs, and fully close if the BIP 70 request was issued by another dongle.

As said earlier, those holes are at best temporary (if not imaginary), and mobile OS vendors have a strong incentive to close them as soon as they happen, so combining both a computer and phone authentication creates a stronger security environment.

I'd say they were looking for a software solution to a hardware problem (because it's more convenient, less risky, no idea ...) - if you have physical access to a device, enclaves are going to help a bit, but not much. They're typically not designed to protect against that.

No, the security card is only to use it with the Ledger Wallet application - you can use it without the security card with GreenAddress and Electrum 2.0 already. Electrum let you create the seed with a nice Python wizard.

you're also sharing every transaction you make on the blockchain, which private, centralized companies are totally free to parse. 
Greenaddress takes all steps to make sure that your bitcoins won't disappear if they do, and is actually centralized for a good reason, providing instant confirmations - on top of it this is done in a way that doesn't compromise users privacy (you have to sign a message to check that a transaction is coming from Greenaddress)

It's exactly the same issue as for the STM 32. If you don't know how this part works (damn, it's not open source), or if it hasn't been evaluated seriously (FIPS or CC with resistance to physical attacks), you can't assess how easy it would be to glitch that for an attacker, making those chips quite unsuitable for a ready to use security product shipped to end users.

our official advice is still not to transact if there's a fork. We'll offer different nodes when necessary, in the meantime if you want to prove a point about UASF the best option is to run a node yourself. My personal opinion is that Segwit2x will activate Segwit before  so UASF is not necessary.

You start with an onboarding process for each site/entity you want to receive signed payments from.
The site/entity generates a certificate, along with a checksum that is sent to you through a second channel (such as a SMS). The certificate is sent to your hardware wallet, signed by the hardware wallet, with a checksum computed by the hardware wallet and displayed on your computer. The hardware wallet only accepts payment requests issued by certificates that were onboarded this way.
Onboarding should be done on a trusted computer in all cases, if the hardware wallet has no display (when using 2 hardware wallets, the certificates will always be issued by a CA hosted by the wallet, so they cannot be forged, but you can imagine having an attacker pushing its own CA generated by a hardware wallet and able to control the checksum ; when importing an arbitrary certificate, more attacks can be done of course) - selected sites can be pre-onboarded when the wallet is delivered to customers though, but of course it's not a requirement, just some convenience when the hardware wallet is delivered by a third party.
if the hardware wallet has a display, onboarding can be done on an untrusted computer as the checksum would be easy to match.
Then this site is requesting a payment. It displays a BTC address to the compromised computer (all hope is lost here), and advertises a payment request signed by a certificate that was previously enrolled by your hardware wallet.
This payment request now cannot be modified and is handled transparently by the hardware wallet, which sends back the transaction.
The "personal certificate" scheme we implement makes things easier on the sender side because the certificates are always bound to a wallet key, so you know that you're not signing arbitrary payment requests and you can create a large number of certificates.
Then I realized I answered on the wrong thread. The above was for BIP 70. Oh well. Still an interesting read I guess, as it's the most secure transfer method we'll implement on the upcoming version :)
@_date: 2015-10-23 10:07:11
err, which part would you make better ? In my opinion it's easier than implementing OpenID, and it's a bit tricky to integrate into this framework as it handles anonymous credentials (for a smilar study see

It's still safe to use on a compromised machine if it takes two compromised machines communicating together to break the scheme. 
Also I might kindly suggest you try to interact with people in a more civil way, you might get more interesting answers.
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:59:35
it's actually done on purpose as an additional layer of protection against scammers. BTC only signs on BTC, BCH only signs on BCH so you always know what you're doing. Also you can remove the apps when you're not transacting

Also wait a bit to update - apparently the malleability fix is broken 
@_date: 2017-05-11 03:17:37


and they don't have to. I'm sorry if we took time to get back to you, but there's currently an interesting combination of sales increasing significantly (so do support requests mecanically), support being understaffed (that's getting fixed in a few weeks), and too many bank holidays at the beginning of May in France (that's kind of usual, but harder to cope with for a growing company). Not looking for excuses here, just explaining how that could happen and what's getting done to make things better in the very near future.
@_date: 2017-07-19 07:13:39
Sure, the silent majority is extremely convenient to support any point. I'd have said that the silent majority interested in Bitcoin wanted to use it and didn't care about the size of blocks or even the fact that blocks exist.
Claiming that there's nothing wrong about HFs seems also quite dogmatically wrong. From what I've seen Monero routinely hard forks without problems but the ETH contentious fork pushed back development and their roadmap, and created a significant amount of confusion for users
@_date: 2015-02-18 08:30:17
Yes, you can find some information on the OS itself on [Trustonic website]( and the TEE API description on the [GlobalPlatform website](

ok then it's something different. Likely the Python companion app is not installed. Also see if you get exceptions being printed when launching Electrum from a terminal.
@_date: 2015-10-06 20:38:31
a french POS terminal
@_date: 2016-07-16 04:31:24
I'd say mostly because it's a difficult problem if you want to keep it as a true Bitcoin transaction - the time spent building the transaction depends on the number of unspent transactions you're putting in, which is bad when people expect a consistent tap and pay under 500 ms experience. This might get better when different payment channel technologies get more widespread though.
@_date: 2016-07-04 15:18:52
Still better than no roadmap to have a rough idea of where things are headed, I guess.
@_date: 2015-02-16 23:23:18
you don't really care about getting the PIN code stolen if you still need a second factor that cannot be stolen to perform a transaction (same thing for TREZOR, btw. It would be some kind of plus if the PIN was used as a privacy feature, but it's not)

yes it was confirmed, and fixed in due time - nobody lost money on this. But code being what it is, there can still be bugs, and you can still have to update it.

yes more or less :)
@_date: 2015-02-17 21:04:59
the concept is sound, of course the devil is in the implementation - the more testers the merrier, this technology is pretty new and needs to be shaken, this is also why we want to have it commercially available very quickly even if only very few handsets support it
@_date: 2015-02-12 11:03:45
no, the real issue is the lack of large number arithmetic operations on the curve field actually used to derive the keys following the BIP32 specification. I guess you could do that in pure Java Card, but that would be horribly slow and quite vulnerable to side channel attacks.

Point is, Greenaddress isn't the one picking your seed, it's either your computer doing it locally or a dedicated device, but still not Greenaddress. 
If you want to use your own seed created by you after doing a hmac-sha512 on paper, you can perfectly import it into HW1 or Trezor then move forward with Greenaddress.

@_date: 2015-02-17 22:23:33
we merely rely on the TEE provider (Trustonic) for this - and will also support open efforts to port similar architectures on open handsets ( and the USB Armory project are some good pointers if you're interested in this technology)

I think it can't converge without miners support, and opposing miners have no reason to feel coerced by it as long as they can sell their blocks. It's a noble idea (users decide) but I don't really see how it helps solving the deadlock we have right now.

@_date: 2015-10-26 12:57:12


you definitely can't if this is the first time you see that address and you click on it (which is a common use case for people when you pay invoices). There is no proper way to do that other than supporting BIP 70 on the device itself and having the website that prepared the invoice support it as well.
I have no problem saying that having a screen is better but please don't believe that it magically solves all security issues because it doesn't.
@_date: 2015-02-03 13:51:27
also another nice surprise coming soon :) and the new firmware version of course
@_date: 2015-02-18 16:35:43
Thanks - it has been a pleasant ride so far (approximately 2 days to port our generic Ledger OS, and 1 week to find out how to actually do something with the current Trusted UI "API" :p) - 'first' was mostly mentioned for the integration, GreenBits being the first well known Bitcoin wallet to support this great innovative security feature. 
We plan to use TEEs as a way to deliver the exact same experience, API wise, as our hardware wallets - so whatever the bearer (NFC, USB, BLE), whatever the device (Nano, Blue, virtualized), integrators get a unified API with only minor differences.
See you at MWC, we'll be neighbors proudly waving the Bitcoin flag :)
@_date: 2016-07-28 05:07:36
yes, it's possible to use all curves that can be expressed as a Weierstrass curve (so that includes prime256v1 and Curve25519) - those keys would be derived from the seed, it's also possible to import them if you build a custom application (same thing for RSA keys - the platform supports RSA and onboard key generation up to 4096 bits)

well, if you initiate the seed creation on a computer then type the seed on say a TV, I'd say it's reasonably safe. 
An alternative is to perform the setup on a computer you trust.
@_date: 2015-02-01 11:36:13
The current version is secure enough when used on different compromised computers, the upcoming firmware version will improve the security when used on the same compromised computer for a long time by pairing the wallet to your phone.

Unfortunately when you're dealing with malicious parties with more time than people actually growing the ecosystem and a strong disruptive agenda (as shown above, you just don't skip that part of the text in a translation by mistake), strong moderation (please let's stop talking about censorship in a private space, it doesn't make sense) is the lesser evil. 
I use the other sub in read only mode for anything else than answering support requests because the rate limitation also prevents meaningful discussion and I don't have infinite time to deal with the aforementioned issue
@_date: 2015-10-26 23:37:03
cool, then it's as true as with all other hardware wallets.
@_date: 2016-07-21 23:47:29
Any wallet on Marshmallow handling secrets the right way should be as secure as any other wallet on Marshmallow doing the same thing. 
Also we're talking about hardware isolation, not hardware encryption - it's still a young (but quite promising) technology with its fair share of issues - see  for a recent one.
@_date: 2015-02-17 22:31:47
definitely. OS vendors are pushing hard for this (Trustonic probably being the most advanced today) and in the meantime dedicated secure hardware devices can bridge the gap
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:45:17

It applies to a limited extent : a malware has to be designed in a  subtle way on both devices to make the second one display what the first one has supposedly done, and the attacker is stopped once one compromised device is detected, because the key never left the Ledger Wallet in the first place.
On a multisignature solution, a malware can break through both devices protections in a non subtle way, fetch both seeds, and compromise the accounts forever.  
@_date: 2015-03-24 23:57:31
Adding a sticker doesn't add any kind of security. You don't know what the sticker is supposed to look like in the first place, and an attacker can easily replace the full box.
@_date: 2017-07-08 06:08:38
so, the attestation mechanism is slightly different between the Nano and the Nano S and you're mixing both slightly, which is perfectly fine as that's not extremely detailed.
The original HW.1 (and Nano) uses an old style mechanism where a batch holds the same private key, and is able to sign a nonce to answer a challenge. This is fine for privacy purposes, since it doesn't create an identifier for each device as a side effect, but not great security wise as a single device compromise could break the attestation feature for all devices included in this batch until an update is pushed.
The Nano S (and Blue) implements a better attestation mechanism, which can actually be described as two algorithms.
The first one is a system attestation mechanism let you verify that a unique device generated keypair was indeed signed by Ledger during the factory personalization process. Since this creates a unique device identifier, this mechanism is only operating internally (when booting the device or running an application on the device - it is not available to applications though) or when triggered by the user (see 
The second one is an application attestation mechanism that is fully opt-in and can be provisioned either by a user certificate or a Ledger certificate. Applications running on the device can rely on this mechanism later to prove to a third party that they're operating on a trusted platform (see 
Note that the Bitcoin application doesn't use the attestation mechanism externally on the Nano S (as we figured that giving an opportunity to collect unique device identities associated to balances wasn't extremely wise, even if strictly opt-in), so you'll have to go through the manual system attestation validation once when you receive the device.
We believe that this attestation feature is indeed quite interesting - it can be used to implement an [OPENDIME-similar]( private key exchange scheme, Oraclize has been using it to [prove trusted computations onchain]( and so on - and we plan to improve it in the future to make it more privacy friendly with anonymous attestation schemes.
@_date: 2017-05-19 20:15:38
yes, obviously. Now how do you prevent them from doing that when they can still sell their blocks ?
@_date: 2015-03-25 06:59:18
Such organization could definitely extract the attestation private key from the device, luckily I think they have better (at least, for their own definition of better) things to do.

You should be able to create a multisignature wallet, then restore and use the XPUB from the hardware wallet.
You can find a few examples here  or  - this should work with the latest Electrum binary, no need to recompile.
@_date: 2016-05-21 11:16:09
In my opinion the easiest option in that case is to store the xpub on the server side and offer a regular donation address, whcih is cycled periodically and automatically on the server using bip32 public derivation.

Well, like most things in security related topics, the devil is in the details. In that specific case, a few examples

Should you use it on a trojaned computer to pay to an address you know with a transaction that will generate change ? Depends if you can afford to lose the change or not

they could if technically all users in a proposal were using Copay on Chrome (but that's still a bit far fetched and extremely unlikely) - there's a bigger risk regarding data collection and privacy issues.


problem is with hardware you always need to trust somebody at some point unfortunately. We used Secure Elements for our application typically because they reduce the trust points - typically you have strong guarantees that the production line won't be able to modify your application (Yubico had an [interesting blog post]( on that topic)


I believe you are more likely to find those vulnerabilities on hardware which is not tested for secure applications - all hardware available today has a proprietary part. Typically the popular STM32 microcontrollers used in other hardware wallets have open specifications, but some critical parts are left in the dark (how the JTAG disabling / flash locking is actually implemented, how the ST bootrom is working ...) - the major difference with a Secure Element is that the latter has been designed with protections against software and physical attacks in mind and rigorously tested.


In the first release the entropy is only collected from the Secure Element, which uses a hardware RNG. We had to freeze the code at some point, and mixing entropy would have introduced some large changes in the UX and firmware logic (typically the USB layer is not yet turned on when we provision the device). It'll be easy to add user generated entropy (typically from dices) in a future UX update.


No, it's not necessary - the device can be set up by itself. 
@_date: 2016-07-28 16:50:32
glad to hear that fixed it, would you mind sending us (to support some information about your USB controller ? the output of lspci -vv should do.
@_date: 2016-07-01 04:18:01
You can use Chromium and even compile it yourself if you feel like it.
The point of using Chrome is to make it easier for the user as there is almost nothing to install - it is the first browser to support communication with USB devices (thanks to FIDO), and unfortunately this technology takes some time to be ported to other browsers, but Firefox support should be available soonish.

No, but the client sends a BIP 32/44 path to use as change. That might be a bit far fetched for the time being, but a ransomware could send it to an arbitrarily complex path and get a fee to tell where it is.

Yes, you're totally right with that. We've published [the source code of the old Ledger Wallet application]( as a Java Card applet running on modern JCOPs, which uses an interesting new second factor method - unfortunately, it's not possible to create a HD wallet using Java Card, because it lacks the cryptographic APIs to do so. We're discussing with several vendors to add them, and will have a few other surprises in this area :)

I don't specifically recall what you reported so I'm not going to be able to help much unfortunately. The researchers that participated to our bounty program generally seem happy with it.

"become" is quite generous. From my personal experience, those opinions have always been the most visible on the other sub, effectively ruining the experience. I can't imagine how a newcomer could parse the first page and not NOPE instantly out of it on most days.
I could create a monster TLDR list that'd make their ydtm poster pool proud, but just to quickly list the best  recurring ones :
* the other sub is uncensored (because yes, (bot assisted) downvoting users based on username rather than opinions, making their posts invisible to most users who didn't tweak the default reddit options and rate limiting them so they can't answer is totally not arbitrary moderation. Also do not even dare to deviate from the unofficial party line as a member of a company operating in the crypto space if you can't deal with being called names on the very good days, boycott threats on the good days or anonymous libel popping up on the bad days)
* this sub is censored (the moderation policy is quite strong and sometimes bizarre but at least there is a policy to refer to which sure beats explaining your point to an angry mob of anonymous clones)
* Blockstream is owning Lightning (nope, just a contributor, not even the first to release something, see Thunder from blockchain.info and the 21 pool)
* Blockstream is pushing for small blocks to gather fees through Lightning and other 2nd layer technologies (see above)
* Axa is a major shareholder of Blockstream (any public proof of that somewhere ?)
* Axa is driven by the evil Bilderberg group (no further comments necessary I guess)
* Yay, China is supporting us, let's translate all the things (on odd days) (because China is an homogeneous block that totally cares)
* Fuck China, they're all stupid anyway (on even days) (well, "they" still don't care)
* ZOMG, my transaction didn't go through, the stream is blocked (with no debugging information of any kind provided - bonus points for creativity when mixed with a tinfoil explanation for not posting this information)
* Random showerthought because Satoshi vision / the market (yeah, sure, whatever you say)

I'd wait until the dust settles on the "other controversial hardfork experiment" before wishing too hard for a hardfork, but that's just my personal opinion
@_date: 2016-07-04 06:18:02
or maybe because all miners want to protect their hardware investment rather than running random software, cross their fingers and hope for the best

it'll probably be easy enough to fix if we could reproduce it (so far we couldn't) and/or if a customer could provide usb logs (look up usbmon on Google)
@_date: 2016-07-29 09:05:43
yeah well unfortunately there is no simple answer to your request, which is why pre-made products exist :)

I think the word you missed is "critical"

That's not going to happen, but several optimizations will be integrated in the next versions to allow more applications to work together.
@_date: 2015-02-17 21:09:02
it's only supported on 910c and 910h. I'll keep you updated when more devices are supported
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:58:24
I've no idea, considering the usability part is usually delegated to the client wallet running on the computer. You're just supposed to read (smallish) things and push buttons to approve/reject transactions on the device itself
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:05:31


A small, testable part is proprietary. An interested party can verify that the applications do what they're supposed to do and that the kernel/application isolation layer is not lying.
@_date: 2017-06-26 07:37:20
It shouldn't be really surprising for people familiar with generic MCUs (I presented about that some time ago, 
Now there are several possible outcome to those attacks : the less critical being that they managed to recover the flash of a device - in that case, you protect against that by using an additional passphrase on top of your mnemonic, the most critical being that they managed to rewrite the bootloader without tampering the device - in that case, you're pretty much SOL because you can't expect users to check the full platform integrity every time they boot.
@_date: 2017-06-29 06:48:50
Unfortunately the original supplier of the hardware died (twice) and rebooting the project with the same chip doesn't really make sense - we might restart something low cost in a different form factor later though.
@_date: 2017-06-06 10:38:04
they are - 
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:16:24
No, as long as you own your private keys, you shouldn't worry about a fork. You're totally free to decide what to do, the best course of action being to wait it out if you're a long term investor and don't want to spend too much time on it or take extra risks.
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:08:03
I think the idea is that they're placing ads for companies that have an affiliate program from which they can get some extra revenue - but it'd be great to document this policy with more details.

not in a way that'd really make sense to be profitable for the attacker
@_date: 2017-06-09 14:13:33
The temporary passphrase is a BIP 39 passphrase that's only active until you unplug the device. 
The plausible deniability PIN associates permanently (until the device is reset) the passphrase to a PIN for easier access
@_date: 2016-07-24 11:21:31
Speaking about that I don't really see why they should be pissed off compared to what's currently happening on ETH. Their hashpower and revenue is not at risk, and I'm sure they appreciate this.
@_date: 2016-07-17 10:38:44
You can also play with our [Ledger Wallet applet]( if you can load applications on your Yubikey Neo (if it's from an [old batch]( or issued by [Fidesmo]( - the latter would be for new users, probably not for you though).
It'll work over NFC with wallets supporting Ledger Unplugged (Mycelium, Greenbits) and over USB (experimentally) with Electrum.
If it's a regular Yubikey that only does 2fa or u2f, you're out of luck.
@_date: 2017-06-11 10:33:54
it's always better to handle it yourself for long term hodling, and even more in that case - leaving your money on an exchange during a fork could prevent you from withdrawing it in time (optimistic scenario) or you could lose it either fully or on one branch supposing the exchange takes bad decisions (pessimistic scenario, which already happened during the ETH/ETC fork though)
@_date: 2016-07-24 07:26:08
(disclaimer, CTO of Ledger, just in case) 
1/ The desktop and Chrome app are pretty equivalent security wise. One major difference is that Google could disable (that already happened in the past for Kryptokit) or theoretically push silent updates to the Chrome app (but doing so would pretty much destroy the whole Chrome ecosystem, so it's rather unlikely). You can also install the Chrome application manually in developer mode in Chromium to remove that risk, providing you verify the code properly before.
2/ HW.1 and Nano are similar hardware and software wise, they're our entry level products. Nano S (out in a week) adds a screen, buttons, and an open SDK for dynamic applications. HW.1 and Nano sign blindly transactions coming from a multisignature input (considering the other parties will also get the opportunity to review it), Nano S will let you review the transaction before signing it (in a future update, not with the currently shipped code)
3/ Note that this is only related to HW.1 and Nano because they are based on an old generation smartcard, Nano S will be mostly Open Source. My most unbiased take on the trust issue is that we've been around for what passes as a long time in the cryptocurrency space with no issues reported.
@_date: 2018-12-19 15:22:49
Wouldn't that mean that our future users are already using the product ?
@_date: 2016-07-27 16:14:15


Yes, and it'd be quite easy to do that (for HOTP. For TOTP you'd need a secure time source to synchronize with initially, but we'll publish some samples). We'll update the SDK and samples shortly.
@_date: 2017-06-28 06:05:10


You always have to trust at least the manufacturer and the chip vendor when using hardware.


I don't really see how this relates to the current discussion.

yes, but then most users would be quite confused.
@_date: 2016-07-28 14:56:54
we can also easily add an application to let you enter the private key directly on the device and sweep it from there for extra security
@_date: 2017-07-19 09:39:17
Unfortunately forking won't help much on that. A limited resource will still be limited, and a higher Bitcoin price will always lead to higher fees. 
@_date: 2016-07-29 11:35:39


that's not really [good advice.](
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:48:28
yes, it's possible to verify it by observing the chip behavior - the same way you'd look for a side channel vulnerability actually
@_date: 2016-07-14 13:48:31
FYI, 14th of July is a bank holiday in France, and support works better than reddit to report issues.
It'll likely be fixed in a couple hours.

@_date: 2017-06-19 14:49:19
One major difference being that merging BIP 91 to be compatible with all already deployed nodes made sense.
@_date: 2017-07-25 05:14:39
Because the Nano enforces a control on that, merging the Segwit firmware and testing that change is not realistic for the 1st of August - the newer platform is much more flexible regarding quick changes as we can just issue a quick patch in a dedicated "Bitcoin Cash" application
@_date: 2017-06-28 17:16:03
problem is, the backup is really really necessary. Hardware will break randomly, get displaced, and you'll lose funds if you don't have a backup. If you're worried about writing down your mnemonic, I'd suggest doing it anyway and add a BIP 39 passphrase to the account you plan to put serious money into
@_date: 2016-07-24 07:09:46
I thought coinwallet was just a front for the first fee/spam attacks back then. Never heard of anybody using their service.

The sentence is related to the findings that were presented. We don't claim to be ahead of the competition by using a self verifying chip, we claim to use the right architecture to hold secrets - i.e. a chip that's hard to attack physically.
@_date: 2017-06-11 13:26:18
I'd say that the platforms are different enough to convince you to wait a bit if you want one or the other.
@_date: 2018-12-28 17:14:03
If you spend some time on both side of the fence you'll find out that it's pretty common for researchers to glorify their findings and for vendors to downplay them. I'd say that by industry standards we're pretty fair with our assessments.
@_date: 2017-05-07 22:15:10
The general consensus is that they're largely uninteresting, [the archive itself has been heavily edited]( and contains a patchwork of different unrelated stuff (such as Gemplus items, which stopped being relevant in early 2000)
@_date: 2016-07-28 16:22:53
well, yes, you're not supposed to let the backup hanging around. If you have a better alternative to suggest (protecting against both losing the device and forgetting a password) we'd be happy to hear about it.

I'm not convinced that driving users into custom wallets integrated into third party applications is a sound model as users typically pick a wallet for a specific set of features they like (better security, more privacy oriented, different coin selection and so on)- sure it helps the UX though

yes, we shipped the first batch of preorders today, and most of them should be sent by the end of the week.
@_date: 2016-07-29 08:53:03
verifying the full chain including the bootloader is still complex, and involves opening the device at some point if you are really serious about the zero trust experience, compared to flashing your own chip.
@_date: 2016-07-31 16:51:45
yes, you can import a BIP 39 seed without a passphrase for the time being. Passphrase support will be added later.

@_date: 2016-07-28 04:59:56
The source code will be available for all the non secure (STM32) part and some of the secure (ST31) part. Ultimately it'll be available for most of the ST31 with a minimal binary blob implementing the chip functionalities only available under NDA. It'll also not be possible to reverse engineer this binary blob, but it'll be possible to check that it's not performing any other functions than those which are documented.
It's possible to do a deterministic build of the applications and the MCU. Ultimately it'll also be possible to do a deterministic build of the ST31 OS not considering the minimal HAL available as a binary blob.
The device design and PCB will be as open as it currently is for Blue ( - I'd say that it doesn't strictly qualify as Open Hardware because of the restrictions to get an ST31 and the fact that it is not possible to build a 100% Open Source OS on top of it but we're willing to sell bare ST31 chips with the blob to interested parties to make it almost similar.
I elaborated on our vision for Open Source development on Secure Elements on the following Medium post

We don't offer recovery services as you should always be able to recover with your mnemonic. Yes, that's a pretty rare soldering problem. You can RMA it and will get a replacement quickly.
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:46:46


no, there aren't. All users complaining have messed up backing up their mnemonic somehow. Your best option is to recheck with the BIP 39 dictionnary words that could be similar and try those - usually there's only one word not written down correctly

@_date: 2017-06-09 14:01:02


because securing the package doesn't do much when you don't know what the seal / package will look like and we cannot link a unique identity to the package for obvious privacy reasons.
