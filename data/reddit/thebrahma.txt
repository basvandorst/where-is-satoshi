I'm simply letting people know about a scam. I know this concept is hard to grasp because reading is sometimes hard to do. It's just 270 dollars I'm not worried about it. You've got to read better and fight the urge to try and be a fake millionare buddy. 7 years though...soo impressed

Such as? Every other site gets outsed as a scam every 2 seconds. I generally use a btc atm and deposit my money directly into my wallet but I didn't have access at the time. I've seen people use this site successfully before so I've seen it work. But thanks for the snarky bullshit comment haha. And i had thought someone actually had some intelligent input to add but it is reddit....

Coinbase just had major problems with holding people's btc or money. Some people waited a week for transactions to go through. That literally just happened.

I don't think so. If the money is confirmed then that's, that. The problem is with coinbase

Something is very wrong with coinbase. Some people say they've been waiting a week for transfers and now my total money deposited has gone down as if there is money missing from my transfer

Mine is fixed. It's great because you always know your tax

I never really said anything about losing the 270. It was more about the website being a scam. I've seen it used successfully. I said that. It's ok though, lots of people have a hard time with reading.

I had seen someone successfully use this site before. I said that. But if your spelling is any indication of your ability to read then it's ok cool guy, things get easier when you practice.

What's your btm tax? I end up paying 11.5% which sucks but isn't too bad...
