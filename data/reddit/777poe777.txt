Where was this speech the last few days when all the loser trolls were spewing poison about the crypto world? I dont see them today . Did all their dirty work. Thanks for the encouragement though.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:47:00
Why are you spending time trying to discourage people from bitcoin on a bitcoin thread? Kind of weird.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:39:12
Are you related to Trump? Quit lying.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:33:28
Why are you trying to tell people what to do? What is 
in it for you?  Are you paid to do this?
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:33:50
Who would do that? Not me.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:51:12
They may recoup. Hope they do.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:20:13
This is a site where people write about bitcoin not other products. Go back to Wall Street to shill other products. H
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:08:12
Still waiting for your explanation troll. Anyone who comes on a bitcoin thread designed for discussion and calls bitcoin "silly" and corrects peoples' use of abbreviations is most definately a troll whom everyone hates.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:51:23
You wish
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:56:56
So why are you on a bitcoin thread sayin this? Were you hired to discourage?
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:10:50
So why are you here? Think i will just go write on a medical discussion thread to annoy people with my lack of knowledge and interest????
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:25:46
Or they want you to sell to buy something else worthless.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:05:15
This is exactly why i left the stock market. This strategy used by manipulators to pump and dump along with massive insider trading defied rational thinking. Now these a holes have infiltrated the crypto world. They cannot create invent or develope anything and think they are so smart when they stack the deck to win. I woul rather lose money then sell so some jerk can buy my coins cheap. I will not sell.
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:57:22
Who is eating now? Guess bitcoin is not dead. It survived the corruption another day and made the trolls look like what they really are.
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:29:29
Who wants bitcoin to go down? Greedy asses. I want it to be successful. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:15:03
Does he have one?
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:47:42
You. Your kind has infiltrated with the deception.
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:40:14
Did anybody know what Amazon would do? You hold bc you hope the best for a future. It is not all about you and your profits only and your two bit manipulation games of futures.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:29:21
How about comparing personalities. Narcissism rules.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:11:14
Who are you? You have no understanding of bitcoin. All your comments are those of a troll who is out to destroy. People read all of his comments. See what he is trying to do.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:34:32
They pump and dump all the time. Government regulators do nothing.
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:57:29
Why are you arguing the dollar on a bitcoin thread?  If you are not interested leave? Simple unless your purpose is to create doubt for pay.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:01:04
Who said I lost? Nobody lied to me. I just did not make as much as I could have . Made way more than on stocks
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:10:46
Miss the days when they were out. They just care about pumpinng and dumping.
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:28:06
I second that wish!
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:17:18
Is your hero the wold of wall street? You sound just like the a hole trying to deceive people. What a lying creep.
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:42:17
Did you not see the attemtp to spread Fud yesterday and the day before.?It was as though the trolls infiltrated the thread. They can subtly do damage.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:08:38
Who wants to bet people lie for a reason?
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:41:09
Ahh, subtly instill fear into people. Clever. But no one here buys it. They just buy bitcoin here. Get the picture.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:17:28
What is your purpose in writing this? To convince people to sell so you can buy low? People here know what you are shilling.
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:54:48
Why are you saying this on a bitcoin sight. Just go write about how wonderful is the devil on an evangelical thread.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:53:52
So what? Does that make you a jerk o..?
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:00:08
Try to make money off of someone else's genius invention sounds like a losers game to me. So many people doing it. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:22:12
I guess it is more important that bitcoin is rising and you look the fool.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:49:40
Then leave. What would be your motive in sticking around to discourage people? Hummmmm?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:03:06
Please go elsewhere to do your dirty work.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:35:39
I am old enough to just get that! Lol
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:19:12
They pull the same crap with the stock market. It would not work if people become aware. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:47:27
Probably getting greedy advice from big time investors. Time to find a beyter exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:13:34
You are so dumb troll. Explain to your public what bit coin is all about. You cant bc all you know how to do is troll. Now reddit is no longer cool bc of idiot trolls.
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:24:00
When enough people get burned from this strategy it will be less effective. Hope the people pumping and dumping get burned in the future. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:57:26
Rather lose than have a great a hole buy my coins.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:33:16
And you are on this bitcoin site to do what? Convince people it is worthless like the creep Dimon?
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:53:43
Maybe I would fall for it BC BC BC. I made over 20000 in 4 months and BC BC BC I believe in it. What is it to you troll. Go spread your evil elsewhere. After awhile people will recognize you for what you are.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:07:45
They did this with stocks. Now the devils have to ruin bitcoin. Knew this shorting would corrupt.
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:21:19
Wow what a man! More exciting then Trump.  We are definitely living in a corrupt dark age. Time for a renaissance. Time for something truely exciting. Not just a pretense . Money cant buy you an imagination. You only attract the worst.
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:53:47
Glad I held. All the trolls spewing poison about bitcoin are not commenting now are they.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:05:37
Your name fits your comment. I flat out hate you trolls. Go. Back to the abyss on Wall Street. No one likes you here.
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:32:52
Is Gemini better? Just waiting for verification. Hate getting ripped off by Coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:01:11
The stock market is full of these shills. They have come here to do their dirty work. If people ignore them maybe they will go back to the abyss. Lol
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:24:27
You are doing the lying. Hope bitcoin goes up again and people can see the fool exposed. It is harder to shill here. Most people are wise enough to spot you.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:55:23
Are you still waiting? Lol.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:22:19
Can you go elsewhere to destroy people . Go work for Jamie Demon. That would be so much better than investing in bitcoin. It has sooo much value. It is sooo honest.  Go write your troll bs elsewhere.
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:00:06
Still waiting. Bitcoin at 12.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:08:26
Not smart enough to understand it maybe.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:20:57
Then why are you on this thread if bitcoin is garbage? Gave yourself away troll.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:10:18
Yeah. Follow Jamie Dimon's example. Get out because we dont want your corruption here.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:59:10
Thanks for the decprive remarks. I am still holding just because of a holes with comments like yours and 4v's who are the same troll will different accounts.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:46:00
What we need is less of your comments. Go join Jamie Dimon.
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:28:58
This goes on everywhere. Government regulators are useless most of the time unless pressure is put upon them. Who believes any differently?
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:25:54
It takes coinbase 5 days. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:52:40
I wont have to wait a year. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:14:42
Who are you to tell people what to do troll. What is in it for you i
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:39:42
You mean Jamie Demon's don't you?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:08:49
They are manipulated by a holes. It is too easy to do.
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:35:19
Cant handle coming on a bitcoin Thread to spread fear and negativity for your own profits.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:19:26
They also hire shills to cause panic. Nice liars.
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:41:09
Sorry. Just sensitive bc of all the shills. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:09:52
So can we expect the same Fud the next time contracts come due? I hate the idea of shorting bitcoin.  I wish the short minded would lose badly in the crypto world and go back to wall street. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:14:15
Who said anything about a job? This is investing. Why do you inferiors always think you need money to prove yourself a big dick?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:21:49
His intention is sooo obvious. Shills have imvaded bitcoin to convinve them to sell. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:03:25
They have time and again watched it recover so it makes sense to hold if they can. I did sell some and now I regret it but never sell for a loss.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:53:37
Wonder how many people made money?
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:21:40
The pump and dump strategy would not work if people held. They would lose. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:35:55
Not bitcoin itself but the manipulators.
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:30:30
I have seen this done so many times in the stock market. Somehow they know and nothing is done about it.
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:52:42
You mean the people who lie? I dont get it. The people who short and spread fear? Are they the insignificant fakes of this world?
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:54:25
People read all of 4v's post. Then tell me why he comments on this site. They hire the same a holes to do write these comments on stock market threads to discourage people. Now they are here too. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:33:24
Shill alert!!! Doesnt work as well here though bc bitcoin will go up amd make you look like  the loser. Lose credibility.
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:42:24
Back to the abyss until they are needed again. Lol
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:35:57
It is perverse when it is corrupted. I think we live in the most corrupted time in America since way before I was born in the Guilded Age. Too bad we can't move farther West.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:18:17
And bullshit trolls working for the banks.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:36:24
Why are you then writing comments on a bitcoin thread? To discourage for your own selfish reasons.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:26:21
Not all. Just the self possessed.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:15:23
Yeah like something Jamie Dimon would recommend. Please go join him. Bit coin is not for you. You are this site to shill and to deceive.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:13:33
Glad i held. Going up.
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:15:00
Why do you waste your time writing on a crypto thread when you own no crypto? That isn't my idea of someone who is superior. Just somebody who gets off by being annoying. This used to be a place of good discussion. There goes the neighborhood
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:20:06
With an ego larger than i can comprehend.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:08:56
At least we will have the decency not to troll bitcoin threads and write our deceptive remarks to benefit ourselves and our pathetic masters on Wall Street.
@_date: 2018-08-08 04:07:43
Jamie Dimon old fart ideas.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:44:56
Good luck to you. Make money off of others losses. That seems to be the consensus on this thread today with all the trolling. I need to find a better place.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:48:34
Guess it us better than hearing about the"tulips." Still not selling though. Too stubborn. Cant stand to see someone buy my coins on the cheap.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:27:14
I won't sell. Don't need to.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:42:28
Yeah, SELL.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:44:12
Who said I am losing?
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:17:49
Keep seeing higher lows. I can wait. It is a risk. But so was Apple at one time. I mean personal computers? Who would want a personal computer? Bitcoin , who would want a ...  well , you get the picture. Still , I agree it is a gamble but how strong is your vision? Miriam.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:33:21
Debbie downer. Just better to say nothing.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:55:38
Are you sure you understand the technology? I am not so sure.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:51:00
Don't need the facts. Any loss of money hurts the banks. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:38:38
Add some vinegar to the wound? How many times have I heard this the bitcoin goes up? Better to not say anything.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:35:47
If coinbase didnt use my credit card as a cash advancement there would be no problem. BAC got pissed and do did I. I can still use my bank account. There is need of some regulation because of shit like this. I am all for regulation and long term investment. The technology will be there. The short term traders hopefully will go back to the stockmarket. The trolls can go back with them too.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:45:19
Is there a way to find out who is doing the massive selling and buying? Could big banks be manipulating? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:25:37
Fkin trolls.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:40:58
Feel sorry for the weak people who sell at a loss by those assholes who try to manipulate so they can get in at a lower price. Simple
Why do people tell others to hold or sell? It really is not their right.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:55:23
Besides I can afford to wait.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:29:54
Would really like to know how people and investors viewed Amazon in the beginning.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:19:58
That is disgusting.  I do feel no sympathy when people like that lose. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:29:19
How do you benefit telling people that?
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:48:48
Why would you be on a bitcoin thread saying that? It is as irrational as a person going on an evangelical web site telling every one that there must be another way other than God? Are you trying to convince people of something. People dont want convincing when they are losing money. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:53:03
Have you been on for 2 months? Why would I listen to you? You are not getting me to sell.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:54:32
No emotion here Weinstein. Just wont let someone buy my coins on the cheap.lol
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:32:25
Stupid stories about pink mercedes. You know nothing but trolling.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:35:33
Why does anybody invest? Why are you on this thread to argue and convince people? Not your business in life or is it?
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:12:03
Sell and get suckered. Hell no.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:23:27
I don't miss it. Just a bunch of FUD manipulators. Who needs it?  
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:13:58
No. You just have to try to manipulate deceive or try to cause panic to get people to sell. Hey boyz, bitcoin $2.00 next week. Better sell so I can buy cheap. More for me ; less for you.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:46:19
Wasnt investing in Amazon speculation in the beginning?
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:45:55
You mean conservative investors. Wise investors with vision bought it cheap. It is always a risk.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:27:21
Just look at the history. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:50:39
Do you really understand bitcoin? I have been trying. I really did not understand the use of the personal computer or the internet that came later years ago. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:35:17
The problem is that is rises at lightening speed and you could get screwed.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:57:57
Will the Republicans win in 2018?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:06:54
Hummm. That must be why they gave me 100 for opening a checking account. They have too many people. They should have rejected me. They like turning away people. I believe every word you say.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:29:24
Who is with out a home? You have only been on reddit for 2 days. Come to discourage people. There will always be some weak people out there that you can beat. Great legacy.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:37:30
See a parallel with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:16:44
I will stay to the bottom. Sad but i am too stubborn to let some unbelieving jerk off buy it at a low price. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:20:19
We will see in a few years.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:04:04
Missed my point. They do not want to lose me to crypto. Not hard to understand why.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:17:35
So glad I did not sell. Stupid "emotion" comment
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:39:41
You wont get my coins at a low price ever.
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:00:58
I keep seeing higher lows . Not a problem for me but I am one who thinks hedge funds and day traders are corrupters of world economies. The little Munchkin has the "Wall Street Go Wild " mentality. Hummm , the Big Short. Think I trust any of it?
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:55:17
I care that people lose money. I am human.
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:06:58
Nah, it will go down to $3.00 Just wait. Do some smart day trading. So sick of this crap.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:55:54
Good for you.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:31:30
No way. No one gets my coins on the cheap.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:41:17
I am female but won't sell bc I cannot stand someone buying my coins at a lower price. I can afford to hold though. I think that it is not China fud but manipulation. Dog eat dog world. I hate to be part of it. But on the positive side every dog has his day. Hopefully good people will win.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:19:08
Glad I did not sell. Such a stupid thread.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:30:51
Do people want vinegar on the wound? What kind of person are you? Go back to the abyss.lol
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:41:36
Why vote that down. It is my right to hold. Too bad you dont like it. Plenty of others who are selling. Buy their"s. Just wont get to buy mine. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:32:20
Me too. Waiting and buying later.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:32:45
Has the technology failed? Or is it all the people who buy and sell expecting too much too soon, along with the problems of the exchanges and other abuses by hackers and thieves and scammers and jealous bankers? It is being tested.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:50:23
Not why I invest. Think the technology is revolutionary. You like to make up stories to discourage people. Is that entertaining for you?
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:59:11
It is but what would be anyone's motivation in addin to it?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:53:35
I thought that too. But who trusts copies? I would want the smartest people around to implement the latest technology. Not some inferior losers.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:59:35
Can't use my credit card on coinbase anymore.
