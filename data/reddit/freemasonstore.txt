Just spoke to someone who knows Dorian personally. Passed along the safety message and my contact info. I'm not sure we can do more than that at this point.

Moore's law will dictate hashing efficiency going forward. The Cointerra miners are 20nm. The new intel chips are 14nm. All plants at 14nm capacity down to 68 are full. All GPU sales and manufacturing pipeline are full. 
Hash rate growth should stabilize around moores law long term.
make more sense?

I would imagine he doesn't yet truly understand how wealthy he is, and at the moment its' sitting in BTC. Even if he wanted to hire a security detail that's USD he doesn't have. The plane ride is buying time.

I'd agree with that. We did announce that we are going to do a DAC. Now it's just time and funding that's a constraint.

As a merchant of high value goods, I'm telling you I will NOT ship ANY product without multiple confirmations. This is fine in an overnight drop ship scenario, but not acceptable in a PoS scenario. This limitation of BTC will restrict it's growth. 
How difficult would it be to move to a 10sec rather than a 10 min block time? 
What impact would that have on coin inflation? BTC Value in general? Can we model a faster adoption curve and compare those outputs to baseline?

Bruce has the resources and he's a trusted part of this community. I'd prefer to let him handle it.

So are we saying that the price of bitcoin is undervalued? We're missing 7 mill in income/24 hours?
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:37:24
Exactly.

You're an idiot. If he had that money as USD you think he'd be living in that house? How long for him to convert BTC to USD? How long does he have? Grow up.
