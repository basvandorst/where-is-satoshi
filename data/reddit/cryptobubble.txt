Some more sold at the below swapbots too, not sure if the same guy some cards like BCYDRAGON (also quite rare) and BLOCKSIZECD went for 2BTC.
@_date: 2016-08-16 17:10:07
Yes I saw that too, I've been playing the game for a while... So you think someone is going to take a boat to go and fish the card out of the ocean?

WOW that is an awesome price for a trading card. There's only 200 of these available :)

Just a little piece of advice if anyone manages to reconstruct the file, better be safe than sorry! 
DO NOT DOWNLOAD, ASSEMBLE AND EXECUTE ANYTHING YOU FIND IN A BLOCKCHAIN UNLESS YOU TRUST THE SIGNER OF THE MESSAGES.
THIS IS EXACTLY AS SECURE AS DOWNLOADING RANDOM FILES FROM THE INTERNET AND EXECUTING THEM.

Seem like everyone in the community likes bitcoin and some alts; cash allows for anonymous payments... Once this all digital only money business kicks in it'll be very hard for any money transfer transaction to be anonymous... Unless you use Dash or similar privacy oriented coin. Is the world ready for this? Wouldn't digital money make it even better for governments and authorities to keep a tab on everyone? What are your thoughts? Comments appreciated. 
@_date: 2016-04-10 18:54:42
How is Storj centralized?
@_date: 2016-04-01 05:09:55
Expensive one though... 
@_date: 2016-04-10 04:15:10
Everybody is entitled to their opinion, however calling it ponzi is a little too far fetched IMHO. We have a large community, one of the largest you will ever see in a crypto project with nearly 5000 people on Slack. 
When we launched Test Group B first Storjcoin (SJCX) wasn't as expensive; second it wouldn't have been fair to our token sale contributors who were promised first hands on our software. Also the SJCX required have always been the property of testers who could sell them anytime if they so wanted.
However Test Group B is now over and as Test Group C starts the team is reviewing rules of participation including the SJCX requirement. 
Stay tuned for announcements, we listen to feedback and act upon it. 
@_date: 2016-04-07 22:22:45
It was fun until it lasted :)
@_date: 2016-04-01 04:53:46
Oh boy, what if it's the real thing? Should the feds get their hands on it first or should Factom release it to the public instead?
@_date: 2016-04-09 06:16:43
There is nothing for free in life, maybe air, but for how much longer? :) However Microsoft will allow for Storj software to be easily deployed for testing purposes and/or deployment by whomever wants to use it. Storj allows people with spare HD space to share it and make a few bucks for that, I doubt smaller players will use existing cloud storage providers with Storj. It can be done but tapping in everyone's free local storage is the deal here. Bigger players and enterprises that want to test Storj internally also will benefit from this as it'll be very easy to spin off nodes and get going.

Factom uses the Bitcoin blockchain to anchor entries so whatever gets Factomized gets also timestamped on BTC. 
@_date: 2016-04-14 02:36:36
Love it! Storj's graphic designer rocks!
@_date: 2016-04-10 18:14:46
Not really, you pay for your storage when you upload your files, then Storj will distribute pieces of each files across the network on different nodes depending on how much redundancy is required.
Storjcoin will be mainly used by the back-end to pay sharers of storage. The front-end needs to be accessible and easy to use so there will be more standard methods of payment to cater for non-bitcoiners and regular folks. Nothing is written in stone about that yet. 
Also anyone will be able to use the Storj API to build their own apps and front-ends and select their payment method of choice. Again Storjcoin will then be used to pay for storage in the back-end.
@_date: 2015-12-26 00:54:58
That's a genius article right there, they didn't even ask Factom to comment even though the author has written about Factom previously... It's a one way opinion. I would expect the editor of Bitcoinist, after having covered Factom several times in the past, to have easily reached out to Factom or get the journalist to, but in this instance they chose not to. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 23:14:05
I need to vote too.
# 2 and female character
@_date: 2015-06-25 00:44:08
Great feedback! Thanks for the reply. I agree with the male character in this context so if we were to choose female it will have to be done differently. And yes Moonga, the first game, has over 600 cards already and characters are very mixed between male, female, various allegoric characters: half man, half beast, monsters and even insects. So there is a wide variety. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 17:19:48
We completely agree, this will empower land owners, the people, the farmers, etc, to be able to prove their ownership with an hash stamped on the blockchain forever. Factom can also keep track of eventual ownership changes and keep the records up to date. 
@_date: 2014-12-23 01:15:13
Because the bitcoin blockchain cannot take much more data than it currently does. Factom allows for millions of hashes to be stored on the bitcoin blockchain with a single hash, hence why it requires its own "sidechain".
@_date: 2014-12-20 03:26:29
Good luck with the launch guys!!!
@_date: 2014-12-25 01:22:04

ShapeShift is the easiest way out there to buy and sell your coins, full stop. Nobody here is forcing anyone else to use it. But I tell you there are tons of people who trade altcoins, hence why a service like this must exists. Also not needing an account IMHO by itself is one of the best features. Appreciate people's feedback, it's always good to hear alternative views. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 02:51:11
Agreed, unfortunately humans are corruptible and even if that is not true, in some cases, they are prone to mistakes. At least Factom is trying to improve on that by offering a platform that will allow for truly honest record keeping.

Storj is working on picopayments for Counterparty testing is in progress hopefully that could help using state channels a la Lightning Network (although it doesn't use LN). Also Tokenly is working on another off-chain solution, so there is work in progress to solve this type of issues. Wish SegWit would get adopted and LN could take off sooner but doesn't look like it right now.

They should have a good look at Factom: the security of the Bitcoin blockchain without bloating it. There are other projects and sidechains out there but Factom will specialize in record keeping, making it easy and inexpensive to hash millions of transactions/records specially for businesses, corporations, etc, etc... 
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:06:19
Yes it is, they also did another game called [Moonga](

Why I went to the Satoshi Roundtable is a Sombrero? Because you are a noone who didn't get invited and pretentiously thought that could get away with it trying to record the event or interview attendees to find gosh knows what and spread lies (as you did) after it. Unfortunately people like you and Chris DeRose do so much damage to the Bitcoin community and even your own, Counterparty. And for what? Because of your big egos and wanting to become superstars. You even tried to get a free lunch at the expense of the organizers. 
The amount of lies that I saw coming out of you guys since 2014 (when you got into Bitcoin, at least Junseth) is unbelievable.
Thanks gosh most people don't give a sausage about your lies, it's so evident what you do that it's silly you guys keep on doing this pretending to make a favour to the community. 
Remember Chris DeRose and Junseth are the voices of Counterparty, they brought the project to its knees with all their wrongdoing, even Counterparty developers (especially the funders) are embarassed to have them representing their own community. The funders at one point tried to get rid of them two, and what they did? They blackmailed them. DeRose is the Counterparty Community Director, elected over a very scammy election where they publicly purchased votes, that was a real clusterfuck, can you imagine how truthful they can be in their assessment of other projects? LOL

Here is all Factom announced today in one place:
* Hashing the whole Project Gutenberg (~29,000 books) on the BTC blockchain with 2 single hashes. 
* Here is a link to a screenshot of the Project Gutenberg Hashes on the Factom Explorer:  and a book entry: 
* A new Alpha API release (v.0.2): 
* And a Factom Explorer: 
* The Factom Consensus Mechanism Paper Draft, open for Public Review: 
* A crowdsale to be held in 2015 through Koinify. More details to follow.

I think both Storj and Open Bazaar deserve the award. They have been working hard to make a difference in the crypto space. Their ideas are not aimed at only people involved with Bitcoin and blockchain tech but to regular folks too. Wish them all the best and looking forward to try their software when it launches. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:53:54
That's weird, must be some sort of protection you have on your phone that doesn't allow you to download .apks from third parties? There's a setting to enable that. If not too hard try downloading on desktop then transfer to your phone. But you still have to allow third party installers.  
@_date: 2015-01-17 21:00:10
The main reason is to show what Factom can do, consider that we are still in an early Alpha test, 28,000 books hashed with 2 single hashes on the BTC blockchain is not a small feature. As Factom software evolves integration with other projects like for instance Storj could allow the book themselves to be stored and retrieved. And not only books, any digital data could be stored, retrieved while being hashed in the blockchain with very minimal bloat.   
@_date: 2015-05-07 14:03:36

Factom is about record keeping, with Factom is really possible to build safer and more secure record keeping on a truly global scale. There are three types of proof that allow Factom to do that:
* Proof of Existence: a document existed in this form at a certain time.
* Proof of Process: a document existed and is linked to this new updated document.
* Proof of Audit: an updated document can be verified to have changed according to a set of rules.

Yes I am on the Factom project but I joined them in November 2014 so not something I have been doing recently. I'm also on a number of other projects... 
The point I'm trying to make is that you and Chris come up with lies to make your case against the projects you don't like, you go to great lengths to make up stories just to grab attention and yes to be popular, that is the only reason behind your activism IMO. So that you can make your BU Podcast, Bollocks Unlimited is that it? LOL. 
You don't care what damage you do to the projects you bash (luckily not much anyway). There are a lot of great projects from the ones you bash. You are outright scammers of your own, 100% by using false assumptions and accusations.
Also the personal attacks you and Chris carry on some of the people involved in the space are just out of order. What have you actually accomplished so far with all of this? U got a name for yourself? Any actual scam busted with your Sherlock work? 
Don't bash what you hate, promote what you love. Peace up!

I gave it a go, should read a bit better and I've added the missing parts! Ciao!
"An anticipation of what could happen with digital currencies is CryptoArt, a painting movement born here in the US, aiming to transform artworks into bank accounts, a kind of theft-proof digital piggy-banks."
"(Interview): In the future will be probably possible to live in a purely digital world where also artworks will be and may be kept in some immaterial memory, therefore this trend can instigate a completely precarious world; art is precarious, too. To be honest, it's a change which is quite unlikely today, because... What is an artwork? It's something durable, something immortal." 
"CryptoArt is the perfect combination of all the most recent innovations: of technology, of money and of art. For now, the most important gallery for this new phenomenon is in Texas in the United States. However, the interest of the creative and financial world is growing."
"Online currencies like Bitcoin allow for online shopping and access to parallel markets that are completely anonymous, but not always legal." 
"At the center of all this there's the Internet, the big 'virtual square' where the exchange of this immaterial money happens. Bitcoin is the Internet currency which could give the classical economy schemes a shake. If it ever comes to succeed, banknotes, credit institutions and governments themselves could well become part of our history books." 
"It's too early to say so but art has already started following the money and, differently to all the cases we have touched so far, CryptoArt actually becomes money." 
"Thanks to a digital code placed on the paintings, which interacts with smartphones and tablets, it's possible to load cash money on an artwork in the form of digital currency. Similarly to crowdfunding, loading money on the artwork doesn't give exclusive ownership, it's rather a nice and secure place where the money can't be stolen." 
"CryptoArt finally celebrates the marriage between money and art, the painting is economy and the money, even if virtual, is a part of the artwork."

Thanks for your reply. Understood. Well hopefully things will keep going well in the future. 
While You are around, if you'd like a card dedicated to BTCC and/or BTCC Mint made for Spells of Genesis I'm sure the team would love that. Just DM me if interested. 
Keep up the good work and hope to see more Mint products in the future. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 18:19:40
How are sales going with BTCC Mint so far since you started? In respect to that do you see BTCC continuing minting new coins and products long term? 
Also are you going to ever release BTC themed coins? For example: blocksize debate, Core vs BU, SegWit activation, etc? Just an idea...
Not sure if you are aware but [Spells of Genesis]( a blockchain-based trading card mobile arcade game, has released [several cards]( depicting Bitcoin and blockchain events and characters, such as:
* SATOSHICARD [dedicated to Satoshi](
* GENESISCARD [dedicated to the Genesis block](
* BLOCKSIZECD [The Blocksize debate]( 
* GOXCARD [The stealing of MtGox](
* WHEREBCYCD [Depicting the famous sign held in front of Gox founder](
* SATOSHILITE [For Charlie Lee](
* COINOFLITECD [For Litecoin](
* DAOSOGCARD [The day after card release the DAO got hacked...](
Some of the cards are very limited editions, for instance the SATOSHICARD with only 200 units issued sold for 6BTC at some stage, it's even on [CoinmarketCap](
So do you think you may be interested in releasing some limited edition coin series with a theme? I see the releases so far, love the [Poker Chips]( the [Bitcoin Block]( the [Half BTC]( the first [One BTC]( and the rest too. However over time having only the BTCC Logo on the coins may become a bit boring? What are your thoughts?
I am an avid collector of BTCC coins and love them, I'm very fond of the fact they are loaded with "uncirculated" coins. As a collector it would be great to see BTCC explore different variations and opportunities. 
@_date: 2016-12-09 00:29:29
BoO makes it a breeze to collect all them Spells of Genesis, Force of Will, RarePepe ans soon Augmentors Cards. It's gone a long way since its soft launch and improvements keep coming. :)

The Soft Launch is happening on the web version. Eventually it will happen on the mobile version too but not yet. So you will have to re-download the Android version when available. It may be a while so stay tuned for announcements.
@_date: 2016-09-24 16:50:02
LOL it is a game right? Google and Apple app stores are not decentralized yet, I think you know that. As per the cards they are assets built on Counterparty which uses the Bitcoin blockchain. If the developer disappears (it won't any time soon) those cards are always going to be there until Bitcoin lives... Also those cards can be used in other games as they are already, the SoG team is happy for others to use their assets. LOL the way you say it, relies on a single authority... Dude chill it's a game. 
@_date: 2016-09-14 18:46:38
Yes I understand it can be frustrating seeing your deck and your achievements grow for them to be reset, however this is standard practice with games until the final release. I'm using it more for training and learning about which cards are best to play with on which level, which are the best cards you get by summoning in-game as well as where do you get the most gold. So that when it launches and there will be tournaments I'm ready to kick ass :). I also like to provide feedback if there's something that doesn't work or I'd like improved. I understand not everyone has the same motivations and I respect everyone's opinion.

@_date: 2015-04-10 17:46:32
I rest my case sir. Good luck with your endeavour. Clearly you don't understand how Factom works.
@_date: 2015-04-18 15:52:54
I personally support both projects, not sure why you would say vaporware... Both have very solid code which has been worked on for over a year in Factom's case and over 5 years in Synereo's. Synereo also has a working demo of their decentralized Social Network which you can see here: [Synereo Tech Demo]( Factom has a working [API]( and a [Factom Explorer]( which allows you already to hash anything you need in the Bitcoin blockchain, both going under further development and refinement as we speak. Both projects also have very detailed whitepapers: 
* [Synereo Whitepaper](
* [Factom Whitepaper](
It's easy to say "vaporware" but I would check the facts before saying so. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 18:39:55
Integration and collaboration between projects is a must, a project on its own (as big and supported as it can be) would never be able to drive a paradigm shift in people's minds, regular folks, people that are not into Bitcoin or Crypto. They can be potentially mass adopted within their niche or task at hand. Each project tackles one problem: Ethereum, Synereo, Factom, Storj, MaidSafe, to name just a few... there are more. Imagine all these working together, being able to integrate with each other. That would be amazing in my opinion and I see many of them are very open to do so. Factom and Synereo is only one example. The internet was built by making different protocols work together. I see this as the best way forward for Crypto and Bitcoin 2.0 technologies too. 2015 will see many of these projects launch, I believe it will be a year to remember! Or at least I really, really hope so.

Metadata uses storage space but it doesn't mean that it is actually a file.
@_date: 2015-04-16 16:16:03
Save it for the posterity. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 19:00:28
Good article. I support EverDreamSoft and it's great to see that cryptocurrency can be used for many, many things. Games are a great fit for it.
@_date: 2015-04-06 23:18:05
Glad to see more and more people from legacy financial institutions move to the bitcoin arena. Looking forward for more. Congratulations Jacob!
@_date: 2015-04-10 17:02:45
I replied above, 100kb of metadata yes, not data as in files. Comparing Factom to other storage systems, as you mention, that are cheaper is wrong. It's like comparing apples with oranges. The capabilities of Factom could be enhanced to store data, actual documents or files by integrating with storage technologies that are out there already or even decentralized options like Storj and MaidSafe. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 15:06:13
Way to go! Well done to the team.

Really like the sound of this! More and more gaming studios are getting into blockchain and cryptocurrencies. About time to improve on the closed economies currently used in major games. :)
@_date: 2015-04-17 02:16:22
Still a promo. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 17:01:00
I seem to get the impression that you believe that Factom is actually storing data. Factom is a system of records, it will not store any data apart from metadata related to the documents or digital files that are time stamped in a Factom chain and consequently on the Bitcoin blockchain. Hope you got that clear before you keep going with your analysis.
@_date: 2015-04-04 02:30:47
There are milestones to be reached for the Software Sale, if they are not completed the BTC raised are not released to Factom. So i think that is a good incentive. 
Also you could run Factom software right now, simply follow the instructions on the [Factom API Documentation]( it's the second early release but this is to show there has been a lot of work going into Factom already and progress is being made on a daily basis. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 02:03:21
That is a Factom promo giving previous Koinify customers a little BTC so they can buy a few Factoids with it.

@_date: 2015-04-10 17:09:53
I am well aware of what Factom is and isn't. Make sure you analyse it for what it is and not for what you want it to be.
@_date: 2015-04-10 17:50:50
Again you are misinterpreting what storage means there. I believe this was an attempt to discredit Factom, clear and simple. You are basing your whole analysis on page 14 of the whitepaper and the above comment from Paul Snow. 
@_date: 2015-04-03 22:25:36
Based on what assumptions? Have you checked  ? That should give you a good idea of the progress made so far.

I saw it too, can't stop laughing at it. I mean what happened to it! I feel for him...
@_date: 2015-04-04 07:32:13


That is a nice gesture. The devs should consider moving to a dev based foundation where the main goal is development, leaving politics out of it, a Bitcoin Lab rather than an institution. It may work better for its objective. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 17:47:56
You are using the word storage to misrepresent what Factom is set to do. Again I wouldn't leave my day job if I were you.
@_date: 2016-10-10 12:20:58
This is great news! Congrats to the team and looking forward to see what's coming with Spells of Genesis. Been playing the game over time and it's fun! Also love the cards depicting Bitcoin and Blockchain related events, companies and projects. Keep up the good work.

The platform has been worked on for over 4 years by the team. It still needs finishing up. The code is open source and available at:  If you are good with code you could possibly setup your own Synereo node right now. There is still work to be done, of course, but it's not like there is nothing concrete to go by.

Great idea Paul, and for a noble cause. This should be fun to watch for spectators... Little bit less fun for the "Unicyclist"... I could possibly do 10 meters, including falling off several times before deciding I have had enough! I respect the challenge and I'm pretty sure it'll be quite exciting to watch! Way to go Mr Snow!

Paul Snow, Factom's CEO and superstar presenter, rode his unicycle for 20 miles across Austin to raise donations for charity. 
See the website for the event at 
The ride was divided into four routes over March 25-26:
* [First Route: Cedar Park to Austin](
* [Second Route: A Ride from North Austin](
* [Third Route: A Ride Parallel with MoPac](
* [Route 4: To the Venue!](
Paul completed the first three routes on day one, and the last on day two. We can confirm he is still alive, actually he's never been in such a great shape. He is now all trained up for another of his energetic presentations at the Texas Bitcoin Conference this Saturday.
We have received some donations so far and and want to thank everyone who contributed. You can still donate using the two addresses below, every little helps.

SoG gets a lot of feedback from current players which are mainly bitcoiners, and they find the game addictive and fun to play. There is currently a Rewards Season going on with which can be played Solo or in Guilds. You can see there's aver 630 active players on the Solo Leaderboard:  and about 35 Guilds with up to 5 players each:  The game has soft launched with the web version so far and the mobile soft launch is in the works which once released should have many more improvements. Got to give it time to full launch then we can all have a better idea on how much traction it can get from a mainstream audience. I believe with the help of All 4 Games this will be a great Trading Card Game.
@_date: 2015-03-24 12:52:46
I think this is to cover the charity event that Paul will be sweating for by riding 20 miles on a Unicycle around Austin. I'm also sure they have some juicy announcement to be be made at the TBC.

@_date: 2015-10-15 21:18:10
You are clearly in the wrong, go to the koinify site and read it properly. If you had spoken to a lawyer you will know this. Factom did actually do their research and got their terms clear before the sale. 
@_date: 2016-05-12 19:56:11
Problem is you need to get the app accepted on the stores, and if they use crypto instead of their own payment methods it may be a little harder to get on there. Bitcoin wallets are fine, there are no in-app purchases there, a bit like mobile banking apps.

Have you read the actual terms and conditions of the sale? They were software licences. Factoids can be converted to entry credits which allow you to insert entries in the BTC blockchain. That was clear in the terms and conditions of sale and on the Koinify website. Nobody got misled.
@_date: 2015-03-12 16:25:53
Very good idea, I can see it used in the IT Support Industry especially when an organization has to request support for a third party piece of software/hardware!

In-game Crypto cannot be used, as you may be aware Apple and Google take a cut of purchases made in-game so crypto will not be allowed there, however there may be other ways BitCrystals and other crypto may work in-game maybe around tournaments, competitions, etc.

Test group b was testing capacity and uptime with locally generated data and testers were given rewards based on that. Test Group C will have all other variables as "near commercial launch" where users will get rewarded per storage contract, so they will actually be hosting real shards from files uploaded to the network. Work in progress on finalizing everything but you can already run storjshare-cli and start testing before TGC starts. Storj Share GUI should also be available soon to make it easier for anyone to be able to share their free storage.

When you buy on a Swapbot you send coins from an address, the card is then sent to that address, possibly you used the Tokenly Chrome Extension? When you use that it only asks for a passphrase if you have set it up. There is no username. However if you sent BCY from an exchange then you are out of luck. U should setup a counterwallet or use IndieSquare wallet or even Tokenly chrome extension... Hope you manage to find it.

The list evolves over time, it checks activity on your social media together with engagement and other variables, it's actually a good meter of your social media activity... Once you are on the list got to keep it up! Anyone in the blockchain space can join the listing and after a week, if accepted by the admins, it will show your results. I guess right now there is only the initial data from this week, will be nice to see in a month time how it will evolve...

Check your selected data store location, you should see shards being dowloaded to it, may take a little while for that to happen but it's a good way to see if you are up and running. One thing, make sure your computer time is synced to an internet time provider, most of the times if there is an issue is because your clock is off by few seconds.
