r/BitcoinXT is the next largest subreddit (excluding r/BitcoinMarkets) and we've disabled non-np posts there.  At 13,000+ subscribers we're also much much smaller than this sub.

r/BitcoinXT is a result of nearly unmoderated discussion and all 13,000+ members joined during the initial flare-up of this whole controversy.
I admittedly don't spend a lot of time there as it is quite noisy and full of anti-core sentiment as well as venting of justified frustration with the mods here.  Would I prefer it was more about technical discussion and actual give and take?  Sure.  Am I willing to start down the slippery slope of subjective moderation that has brought this sub to where it is today in order to do that?  Nope.
Reddit has a system to help good content bubble up, and r/BitcoinXT will have to work out what it is as a community on its own.
@_date: 2015-12-01 17:17:12


Bullshit (assuming you're talking about r/bitcoinxt).  Myself, to my knowledge have never been banned from r/Bitcoin, and we did not start an alternate subreddit to spread FUD or attack those with whom we disagree.


You're making characterizations about those with opposing views (which admittedly happens excessively on both sides of the argument).




The OP requested we have a civil discussion, and your effort consisted of only mischaracterization.

If 1,000 people (whom were already a part of the r/Bitcoin community before this controversy broke out) personally disagree with the r/Bitcoin mods and vote once per person then I don't see the foul play.  It's part of the community's actual sentiment.
@_date: 2015-06-20 19:59:31
I understand that, but since some people can imagine a future where this changes they could decide they want to buy it at a price higher than that now.  Not speculating on the likelihood, just pointing out that people have done stranger things than overpay for things.

We've disabled direct linking to r/Bitcoin posts.
What evidence is there of brigading?
@_date: 2015-12-11 11:51:26
It triggers at 75% with a two week grace period.  Given economic pressure, the remaining 25% would evaporate before the fork arrived.
@_date: 2015-12-01 21:18:47
I've found it's helpful to change the vote tallies to hidden for posts and comments for a period of time in the sub settings.

It's equally possible a large group of people that have been a part of the r/Bitcoin community simply disagree with you and vote accordingly.

There's a difference though between r/SRS crashing a r/funny post, and 13,000+ people leaving a sub due to censorship and venting their frustration about the situation regarding the original sub in an uncensored sub that exists only because they can't openly discuss an alternate implementation.

BIP 101 already nails it.  At the 75% mark it triggers a 2 week period then it activates.  The economic incentive to mine the most popular chain is so great there is a 0% chance any meaningful amount of hashrate would remain on the old chain.  Even if the remaining 25% stayed their blocks would take &gt;40 minutes at best and hold outs would switch.

The result has to be low, not the nonce.
Your average ASIC makes millions of guesses a second.  The guess is hashed using data from the previous block, the transactions sought for inclusion in the new block, and other data that results in a hash that's seemingly random compared to the nonce.  The value of each guess, or nonce, won't predictably correlate with the hash result.  
Totally inaccurate example: ASIC guesses 0000000000001 and the result is 38642699642279.  Next guess is 00000000002 and results in 9958832367843267.  Eventually a guess of 688433689653224 results in a hash that starts with the required number of zeros and a block is made.  Mind you these are hexadecimal values so there's letters mixed in.

You can only buy if you have fiat deposited currently on MtGox.  It'd be extremely risky to try to deposit fiat now.
But on to the short short version what keeps getting posted.  MtGox halted all withdrawals claiming there was a bug in the bitcoin protocol.  The issue is actually how they handle transferring btc internally.  Until they rewrite their code withdrawals are still disabled.  They keep moving the goalpost by saying they suddenly need to move their HQ or that they're too busy watching House of Cards.

Alright, at the risk of your ongoing condemnation I'm going to try to explain how one might be puzzled by constant high volume when an exchange stops withdrawals.
Back when BTC-China stopped accepting deposits we saw a period of increased volume as people bailed followed by ever decreasing trade volume.  This is a different situation than MtGox disabling withdrawals I'll grant you.
My expectation watching MtGox these past 2 weeks is that volume would be high as many panicked and converted to fiat.  I imagine it'll be easier to go after MtGox to get some fiat back vs suing to get your coin.  However, I imagined the cooler heads would hold out hoping to not realize their loss by selling their $1,000 coins for 10% of what they paid.  It doesn't seem unreasonable to think that after a period of the weaker hands being shaken out that eventually the trade volume would begin to taper off (particularly given what I hear regarding the difficulty in getting fiat into MtGox).  The trade volume appears to be quite steady though (even higher and more constant than the other exchanges), and that's why I asked my question.
Someone actually [took the time to give me a simple answer]( I hadn't thought of at the time.  80% off the accepted price means the coin volume is high, but the trade volume when looked at in terms of fiat is actually lower than most of the exchanges.
You may resume being a hateful dick now.

@_date: 2014-11-12 18:45:57
Inflation is an increase in the amount of available money.  Since new coins are mined with each block, the supply is increased.  That's inflation.  Since the increased supply is released at a more or less known rate, it's priced in to the current exchange rate.  It's ultimately deflationary once the last coin is mined.

You're right so far as the new coins being released with each new block.  This reward halves about every 4 years.  In the long run it is deflationary as new coins will cease to be created in about 120 years from now.

The value has been growing on a logarithmic scale.  $1, $10, $100, etc. and we're still in the early adoption phase.  $10,000 is actually more likely in my estimation than $10 at this point.

The learning curve for bitcoin is a bit steep.  It could be described as a learning wall really.  r/bitcoin can be a pretty intense way of being baptized into the fire that is crypto culture.
Not a day goes by that newbies don't post questions or observations that reveal their lack of understanding, and the admonishments can come fast and fierce.  It's not always the case though.  Sometimes newbs are greeted with gracious answers and generous tips to get them started, but this has encouraged some to pretend they're new to bitcoin just for a chance at free bits.  Magic internet money being transferred via a reddit comment is powerful way to demonstrate what makes it so great, but it also lures in the vultures and jerkfaces.
The jadedness sets in quick.  I, like many, am guilty of curt responses to new folks so soon after I was posting similar questions.  How quickly we go from, "Is the bitcoin price going up again soon?" to, "Read the damned sidebar."
All that said, I believe the bullish echo chamber that is r/bitcoin is still a better place to get introduced to crypto than say bitcointalk.  
I don't know where I'm going with this.  Your post doesn't make it clear to me if the ideas you're looking for are focused on reddit's relationship with bitcoin or what.  I guess I just want to say that reddit is kinda like the launch tower helping keep the rocket pointed at the sky.  Don't worry about the vampires and tulip trolls clawing at the fins.  They'll be dealt with when spark the main engines.  Just make sure you're inside the ship.

They plan on providing preconfigured mining hardware for no upfront cost.  I imagine they plan on taking their fee from the coins mined.  People will try to alter the hardware so they don't have to mine at the high fee pool the hardware is set to.

The p2p nature is what secures it.  The amount of processing power directed at mining (verifying) bitcoin transactions is beyond anything in the history of computing, and since it's "fragmented" as you put it it is more secure.

There is a common misconception that btc is anonymous.  It's actually psuedonymous.  As a public ledger all transaction are visible.  Once an address is associated with someone it's possible to see which addresses have been interacted with (of which some of these addresses will also have been identified).  This opens up possibilities both good and bad.  It improves transparency over fiat.  It could be possible to monitor where gov't is spending its money, but also could allow for the gov't (and corporations) to monitor how individuals use their coin.
But back to your original point, I think "privacy" works better than "anonymity" though both concepts might not apply.

If you're doing a significant volume and want to keep it completely legal then you're compelled to follow aml/kyc regs, (verifying identity and such) which would turn off some of your clients.

Okay, say they had already acquired enough hardware to put out 20,000,000 Gh/s (which would cost about $88,000,000 USD).  The tech industry would know if someone acquired almost 90 billion dollars worth of hardware in rapid fashion.  And they'd have to spend millions of dollars a month just to keep up with the network's growth.
It's more likely the US gov't would attempt to hold the network hostage by trying to shut down the internet, or that the US gov't actually created Bitcoin and is holding the Nakamoto bankroll.  Disclaimer: I really don't think either of these cases are plausible either, just more plausible than a gov't 51% attack.
Edit: It's likely my math is way off after doing some research.

@_date: 2014-02-22 04:06:58
It is legal.  You don't need to register as a money transmitter.  Some banks have moved to block non-account holders from depositing into someone's account but most still will.  Buying such a large amount might mean the seller will want to verify you're identity to protect themselves from money laundering charges but probably not.
$10k is the limit for depositing cash in a bank account before they want you to fill out a federal form explaining where the money is from so I imagine the law could argue a similar rule exists for buying that amount of BTC.  Ask the seller you contact on LBC.

It initially awoke the gambler in me.  I didn't lose much, but it was enough to make me realize it's not something I should be doing.  Then I started saving.  I accumulated 1.5 btc, and then invested it in mining hardware.  I know it's going to take me a long time to mine that much, but I tell myself it's like a savings account that's slowly unlocking my balance.  0.631 btc earned so far.  I'll probably reach 1.5 btc a year from now.

So the verification is tough.  I got through it back in November after 5 attempts I think.  If you failed you had to wait 24 hours before trying again.
There's a handful of questions, and it's the same stuff you have to answer when going through the annual credit report stuff here in the US.  In fact it is a good idea to go through that process at annualcreditreport.com first (it's a govt mandated site provided by the 3 credit monitors).
You'll have to answer multiple choice questions like, "Which of the following cars did you own?" That's not too hard as most people can remember year, make, and model.  It's usually a question like, "where did you work in September 1999?"  For me there were 3 places where I had worked, and 2 of them were in that same year.  I think on the 4th attempt I had a question about when I had moved during a particular month and I'm certain the answer they were seeking was actually wrong (inaccurate data isn't uncommon when it comes to these databases).
It's frustrating but you can do it.  Reach out to former roommates or family members to jog your memory as far as work, vehicles, and housing dates.  It's definitely a pain though.
Completing it on that 5th try was a relief.  I've never had a canceled order, and the wire from my bank goes through a couple days later.  I use the instant buy feature a lot.  They changed from a BTC limit to a $1k limit, and it takes a few days to recharge when you've tapped out that limit, but it's convenient.
Edit: I bank with a local first responders credit union.  
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:59:51
I'd say yes if you're actually at the conclusion that you're not likely to get it back either way.  There's still a chance that they right their ship and you can actualize a 500% return.

If you really feel that way, then why bitcoin over Googlecoin or Applecoin?  If I follow your logic than torrenting files would work better if all the data was stored on servers by the U.S. gov't.  Perhaps the files would be delivered faster, but then it'd be up to the gov't as far as what files they'd let you have.

Sounds like you're one of the few that's able to profit from your credit card transactions.  EDIT: But even if you're paying no fee merchants you use are.  It typically costs businesses $0.15-$0.35 per swipe which gets built in to the costs of goods and services you use.

Coinbase is more of a shop, not a true exchange.  Fiat withdrawals take days to wire to your bank.

You can't transmit a false transaction. You have to have the private key for the address to move it.  Acquiring enough mining power to take over the network would be noticed long before it was brought online, and the protocol could be updated to ignore said bad actor.

I do understand that the total data structure would be bigger (between 2mb and 4mb if I'm not mistaken?), but the part of the block that housed transactions would still be capped at 1MB?  I do appreciate your clearing up my misunderstandings Luke.  You're definitely known for your attention to detail and unconventional insight.
Edited to clarify I agree that if a properly tested SW is released or a hard fork triggered that 99% would upgrade.  I was pointing out that it's intellectually dishonest to simultaneously say HF requires nearly &gt;99% upgrade while also saying SW is a 2 MB upgrade when that figure is based on its correlation to a similar conversion rate for a soft fork.

If you don't sell/spend it then you haven't realized a gain.
Say you bought 1 btc for $1 a while ago.  Now you spend .01 btc while it's worth $400.  Your .01 btc is worth $4 so you've realized a gain on just that fraction of a coin.  You still own .99 btc and you've realized a gain of $3.99 so far (as that .01 btc was initially worth $0.01 when you bought it).  That $3.99 is what you're taxed for.  Even though the other .99 has gone up in value, until you use it you haven't made anything from it.
Edit: As far as converting from one crypto to another I'm not sure the IRS is willing/able to track that down.

The primary reason r/bitcoinxt became as large as it has is because of the community's desire to openly discuss all potential possibilities for Bitcoin.  There have been questionable moderation practices both here and in r/btc over these topics and others, so I was determined to let any voice (short of those blatantly trying to steal/scam) be heard.
There's a tradeoff that comes with such an approach.  The signal to noise ratio is lower for sure, but it allows for a more open discussion.
I still am the lead moderator of r/bitcoinxt.  It remains as a place where all implementations can be discussed.  XT for Cross Talk has been kicked around as a rebranding.
The r/bitcoinxt moderation team has yet to reach consensus on whether to release an apology for our users.

After months and months of discussion I'm seeing that it's plausible that a simple series of unfortunate misunderstandings and irrelevant but infuriating attempts to hijack/controll the discussion (combined with the fact that Core is inept at making their case) have derailed what should have been a plain if complex technical discussion.
I think the primary obstacle to open discussion now is the vitriol and the ill-informed.  It's natural that people are suspicious or resentful of Blockstream or Hearn's intentions.  It's clear to me now that people drawing attention to such things are not moving the scalability discussion forward.
I'm mostly just sad though.  I can deal with over a year of financial losses.  I can weather the frustration of buttcoin gloating.  I'm not sure I can cope with the high level of ignorance and trolling coming from everyone.  It's impossible to ignore the cognitive dissonance.  "Toomim bros are a joke!" "R3 and Hearn sux!"

It still creates a network split if a sizable number of users do not want to participate in a chain that has it activated.
Make no mistake, this will split the network.  It's been a long and intractable scaling debate, and I know everyone is tired of hearing about it.  But if we let the network split (via UASF or contentious HF) then the most likely outcome is we all lose.

Maybe I'm wrong about the conclusions I've reached, but my only desire is for humanity to have a trustless and distributed economic ledger that works.

1. There are centralization issues with all proposed solutions, and that's on top of the staggering amount of centralization that's already occurred up to now.
2. Miners have more explicit influence than other interests, but there are still checks from other interests on where miners can push this.  Aspects of open systems can definitely be frustrating though when you find yourself in a small dissenting minority.
Scaling is the biggest hurdle, and there are dangers to every approach that's been suggested.
3. RBF is a wedge issue and an effective one.  To many it's perceived that a simple scaling solution has been discussed for years as nauseum, while other contributions that are submitted by polarizing figures and without wide and long discussion in less technical forums are being pushed through.  It's also easy to dismiss the, "But that's because hard forks are hard," qualifier when relations have been damaged by the ease with which you can conflate such issues with those surrounding a perceived shift in how open the discussion is here.

Moderators view any posts making the case for a hard fork with less than complete consensus as rule-breaking.

Let me ask you though since you mentioned the possibility of an unlimited block size, do you really think that the block size would literally be unlimited were BU to activate?  The phrasing of your question presupposes that I "like unlimited block size," which I don't (depending on what you meant).

If they released a Core update with a "I support segwit" setting/option that was opt-in, I'd take whatever percent that bothered to enable it a lot more seriously (even if it's also open to the sybil vector). 
Edit to add: I had a chance to more fully read your comment, and I have to say that if I'm one of the smart BU supporters then we're in trouble!
In all seriousness it does say a lot about the Core approach that a majority of the devs seem to support it.  What's frustrating is knowing that the more restrictive we are about direct L0 access to the chain we are the easier it will be someday for a very small number to consolidate power and access to the freedom that Bitcoin provides.
Maybe at times I am illogical.  Most of the people in this fight are a lot smarter than I am, and have scraped together more bits than I have which means they have more on the line than I do.  I don't care for the ad hominem stuff against Andresen, Back, Marquardt, Ver, or any others.  I don't want assholes to have the final say in how free Bitcoin makes humanity.  The takeaway though is that Bitcoin rewards the smartest but also the most cut-throat.  I can someday accept that Bitcoin as a settlement still is leaps and bounds better than anything that came before it.

You mock the idea because of its association with Classic.
Had such a tool arisen when the community wasn't fractured, and if people more widely contributed to making it better, it would have greater potential for it to become a useful tool that demonstrates where community sentiments lie with regard to preferences in how development is prioritized.
It's definitely more difficult to try and reason with those whom you disagree than it is to mock them, but even at this late stage it has the potential to be more productive.

Gavin supports multiple implementations, as so do many devs.  The issue with XT, Classic, Unlimited is that all three are seen as dangerous in that they would create a hard fork without strong consensus.

I acknowledge that it's dishonest to engage in vote manipulation to try and steer the narrative.  Sadly, that's a part of Reddit and of consider.it which also experiences manipulation from those who agree with you.
Your side seems to pride itself by trumpeting every technicality that lends itself to your goals.  You demand citation to anything that has a component of assumption, yet seem fine ignoring similar requests from those you assume are disagreeing just to be disagreeable.
If you're right, but aren't inclined to hold yourself to the high standards you set for those with whom you disagree, then that generates additional problems that increase the s/n problem.

If you need it quick I'd look into LocalBitcoins.
That said, Coinbase is probably more trustworthy than your bank.  A lot of folks around here are purists, meaning they'll encourage you to store your bitcoins at an address you control, rather than on an online website.  If you don't control the private keys, you don't control your money.
Wherever you acquire them look into moving them to a secure address that only you control, or at least use 2FA if you store them with an online service.
@_date: 2015-08-10 15:35:20
Some places are fine with 0 confirmations.  Some want 6.  If this transaction was you spending bitcoin somewhere then maybe it's an issue with the entity you sent it to.  If it's coin you moved to another address you control then it should be there already.

You can share it different places.  Embed it as a qr code.  It's rare that people get the address to switch, and most wallets prompt you before sending.  Add a clickable link so people can look at the txs on a block explorer so they have a chance to tell you if their donation doesn't get to you.

I think you can buy a small amount from ChangeTip with a card.
The problem is legacy payments are reversible, so people don't want to sell you their bitcoin because you could reverse the charge and steal the coin.
I'd also check out LocalBitcoins and meets someone in person with cash.

If XT reaches 75% it would promptly force a 99% consensus long before we mine the large block two weeks later.  It's economically not viable once that first large block hits to still hash away at a core chain with a fraction that such a high difficulty requires.  Millions of dollars worth of hardware would give up at the prospect of one hour blocks, creating a negative feedback loop.

No one has figured out how to do a decentralized blockchain with fairly distributable tokens that also has an embedded Turing-complete language.  If it releases as soon as you imply it will it'll either be centralized (trusted nodes), tokens won't be distributed fairly (premine), or it will be demonstrably insecure from the moment it launches.

It introduces a hard fork two weeks after exceeding and maintaining a 75% majority of the network.  We're that to happen I expect at the start of that two week period you would almost certainly see everyone consolidate around the supermajority.

A better solution, by its definition, would be better.  I'm still hopeful but no longer optimistic.
I think the commitment to hard fork after SWSF isn't explicit, and I doubt it's sincerity.  In fact, as I read it, the "effective" July increase means they intend a SWHF then.
I'm trying to find the positive in this.  It will be useful to have data on a fee incident, though I think it's very risky.
I don't see this as compromise at the end of the day.  I see one side that's in dismay and another gloating.

@_date: 2016-02-12 21:56:53
Hostile?  Aggressive?
An idea has been put forward as a potential change to open software, and it's been tested.  It requires a strong majority to activate.  Gavin is not holding a gun to the heads of thousands of users, miners, businesses, node operators, etc.  If it isn't a better solution then make the case for the better solution.  Instead you're just trying to scare people.

Ideas are worth exploring even when they're discovered they won't work as a solution.
Open systems allow for ideas to come from anyone, as long as it has merit.  I don't care if someone has 50 bad ideas, they can still potentially come up with the best solution.  And Gavin's batting average is still higher than 95% of his critics.

I don't tell you what your beliefs are, so how about providing me the same courtesy?  I don't want the blockchain to grow exponentially.  It's easy to dismiss people when you can attribute ignorant motives to them.
Reasonable people can reach a different conclusion than you with regard to prioritizing keeping transactions on chain while more elegant solutions are developed.  A modest increase would not have broken Bitcoin.
At this point I'll just be happy if the community doesn't fracture.  I think most of the devs were benevolent and sincere in their preferred approach.

@_date: 2015-07-18 13:46:28
Certainly not.

It's my understanding that the speculation (which it admittedly is given they haven't made their business model public) is to monetize not LN, but the development of private sidechains/ledgers pegged to Bitcoin.

I'm pretty sure Slush saw a doubling of its hashrate in less than a week simply by making a BIP101-supporting node available to miners.

I imagine he knew it was going to be haggled over, so he started high.
8mb was the compromise miners asked for, and that was agreed.  Then 2,4,8 was suggested by Back, and now here we are at a simple 2mb.  I bet we'll see a 100kb bump suggested before the month is out.

This is how open systems operate.
What's complicating matters are the normally reasonable people who've become so emotionally invested in their preferred solution that they can no longer think objectively about the issue at all.

Strange, I feel like it reads as a paranoid interpretation of what's motivating some in the community to support an alternate approach to scaling Bitcoin.  Demonizing others instead of debating the issue is actually quite effective too.
@_date: 2016-02-09 06:55:14
If an alternate client activates I think Core would simply merge a compatible PR, resume developing longer term solutions, regain a lot of its market share, and people would note how remarkable open systems are.

SWSF will give us a little breathing room if it gets merged in time.  I worry that after that we'll be back to, "there's plenty of room in blocks, HF no longer necessary."

Hence a majority of miners would never increase the 21m cap, so it doesn't work as a comparison to the majority of miners reasonably deciding to scale the block size limit.

BIP101 uses a 75% supermajority to leverage overwhelming consensus.  The remaining 25% would capitulate.  So, how can discussing that be considered discussing a client that doesn't involve overwhelming consensus.
How overwhelming does consensus need to be?

A lot of decisions were benevolently dictated in the early years.
@_date: 2015-09-07 17:00:37
We only lose consensus if the remaining 25% of miners fail to follow the economic incentives within 2 weeks, which would be EXTREMELY unlikely.

There will be some sort of coin separation service, no?  A lot of folks might have to consider what to do with their BTC and their UASFcoin.  Exchanges will carry both if there is an actual split, which looks unlikely at this point.  Stephen Pair of Bitpay describing it as astroturfing undermines the narrative that the market supports it.
I heard you were open to an amicable split if both sides surrendered the B name.  What about Scoin and Bitcash?
I think with the resources each side has and given the entrenchment, the best solution may be to shake hands and part chains.

It's pretty easy to explain if you're honest about the reality that others aren't willing to make the same assumptions that you have.  Stephen Pair of Bitpay calling the campaign astroturfing runs counter to the assertion that the economic majority prefers such an approach.

If 148 activates with any meaningful hashrate (and it doesn't like to me like it will), you can bet the legacy chain will hardfork to a larger block size limit.  The additional result being there would then be no risk of a reorg for that chain.
@_date: 2017-05-29 00:54:28
70% of the hashrate isn't signaling segwit.  Do you really think Jihan owns 70% of all ASICs?  Can we get some facts instead of ad hominem attacks?  It's a technical discussion FFS.
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:44:34
No it wouldn't because a chain that hard forked invalid rules wouldn't be seen as valid to UASF chain.

If the segwit supporters get on a minority hashrate chain, the legacy chain would have strong majority support to do a hard fork.  If BF and other pools are hashing a different chain then the legacy chain would have a better shot at their hard fork.

This is the first time r/bitcoin_lotto has been posted here to my knowledge.  I do feel this post isn't appropriate for r/bitcoin and have advised u/bitcoin_lotto from doing so again.

Complete all of the verification levels before you buy.

I know right?  I've been thinking it might have been me that started the panic.

Just like any lottery.  We're still building the site but are experimenting with using a subreddit and bitcointip.  You bet using BTC.  Jackpot is all bets minus 1% and winners are determined using true random number generation.

It can be argued that math is what backs up bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-25 05:31:03
The explanation I keep seeing is that some exchanges are difficult to get certain currencies in our out of.

I've already linked my account to coinbase and bought some BTC.  Just wondering if I can convert a Visa gift card.

Volatility is a given if all national currencies collapse.  I'm not asking the ideal path.  I'm asking what happens to govt and people in the event of a rapid shift to BTC by everyone around the globe due to mistrust of their local fiat.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:57:15
I want my return in BTC!
@_date: 2013-11-28 05:20:45
Mostly it's attributed to the difficulty involved with moving currency out of the exchange.  Gox is famously difficult to get USD out of, taking several months according to some (so people end up buying btc to get their funds out hence a higher price).
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:28:04
Since they're already tied to those 4 fiat currencies they wouldn't even have to create more for them to lose value.
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:40:16

The computer clients act as full nodes, downloading the full blockchain.  The Android wallet I assume is like Electrum in that it doesn't act as a full node, hence doesn't download the massive blockchain.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:46:30
@_date: 2013-12-24 06:47:05
Coinbase or bitpay will allow you to convert it to fiat on the fly.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:44:48
It's my understanding that BTC derives its value from people wanting it and accepting it for good and services.  It's powerful because it doesn't need govt nor  institutional support.
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:21:34

I'm with you.  bitcoinparanoid is the altar I've been staring at.  I bought .06 btc on Thursday from coinbase and can't stop checking for the pending deposit.  In fact right now I'm about to see if I can set up email notifications for received funds.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:44:20
Why not send them bitcoin?

Newbie here.  You can link a checking account with coinbase or another exchange and buy BTC.  CB also takes visa I believe.

I don't believe we're reaching the resistance level.  Lots of newbies are still waiting on exchange verification and are yet to buy in.  I'm predicting $1000 by turkey day.

What?  Coinbase charges about 1% about bitstamp's market price.
Unless you're talking about buying a very tiny amount of btc.  I think there could be a minimum fee perhaps.
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:52:55
1,120 next week.

Your bank is likely to honor the transaction and then charge you overdraft fees.

If you click on the pending transaction it will tell you if you bought at a set price, and when it deposits to your wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:29:32
When he started buying the price would grow huge fast.  If he was buying $6 billion, by the time 5% of his buy orders transacted the price would skyrocket.  I'm talking $1000 to $8000 per coin.  He already lost most of his buying power.   
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:23:49
If you're impatient you can look up someone in your area selling bitcoin for cash on localbitcoins.com and arrange a meet up.  If you can wait through the verification I think Vault of Satoshi is the way to go for you Canucks.  Good luck!

That's why I ask.  How useful will my BTC be if the US gov't implodes and everyone is standing in bread lines?
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:57:53
So you are saying nobody really knows?
I see more and more people switching to BTC as they realize it can't be controlled by the govt and can't be easily taxed.
What are some likely initial actions the US would take if they noticed a much more substantial amount of USD being converted to BTC?  Wouldn't they be inclined to begin accepting BTC directly in the event of extremely rapid devaluation of the dollar?  If the global populous decides they trust BTC more than their fiat then aren't their hands tied basically?

This.  First they will use a service like bitpay which converts to fiat on the spot for a fee smaller than cc processing.  Then merchants will begin to kick themselves for not holding some revenue as btc.

In theory yes.  Deflation is built in.  Plenty of other factors could push the price down though.  Your guess is as good as anyone's.

If they are on reddit you can use bitcointip to send it to them.
