I've had success with a cash to mt gox transfer on bitinstant but since then they have had issues, i have also had success with a cash to bitfloor transaction but they too have been having some problems. Mostly it comes down to the "instant" options being overwhelmed making it hit or miss if the transaction goes through.

So i did some testing and created 50 new addresses, no collision events but i did notice that the mnemonic is based directly on the password, ie the same password will give the same mnemonic every time, this is rather poor from a security standpoint because it means that they are probably not [salting]( the password hashes before storing them.

Oh i don't think i've done anything too spectacular. I originally got into bitcoin in march of last year, ended up getting 10 or so and then cashing out after a few months due to lack of things to do with them. The upside was that when i heard about it again in late last month (from my non-technological dad of all people) I was able to jump back in quickly as i already knew the details and had verified accounts at Mt. Gox and Dwolla. I have made 1 successful deposit each with bitinstant and bitfloor both just before they stopped working consistently and am currently just watching and enjoying the increased attention that bitcoin is getting in the wider world.
@_date: 2013-10-12 07:48:20

Send a moneygram, there will generally be a red phone you pick it up and walk through an automated system putting in the amount, account number and such that bitinstant gives you. Then you go to the register and tell them you are paying a bill with moneygram, they check the amount any necessary fees are added in and you pay for it with cash. One issue i ran into is that the cashier has to put in the "amount to pay" not the "order amount".

That is just one case and then only if the blockchain were to increase by over 100 times what it is now. And remember this is only if you want to run a full node.

Bitcoin's volatility is a well known and fully acknowledged flaw, stability will come in time as more people use it as a currency rather than a commodity. Also gas and credit cards are a particularly terrible choice as an example as often credit transactions are only charged 1 dollar for up to a week and then the price is later adjusted to what you actually spent.
@_date: 2013-11-06 15:55:13
To me it just sounds like a lazy 51% attack, potentially possible, but questionable as to the amount of damage it would do, and getting more difficult every day. The real question is if you have that much hashing power why wouldn't you just make coins for yourself normally.
And yeah we have some very intelligent and hardworking devs keeping the protocol as safe and secure as possible.

Sure but they could still use a salted password as the basis for the mnemonic and then just remove the salt before displaying it to you. For best results the salt would be random and then encoded into the mnemonic itself.

Got ya, If you want to move to a live CD based wallet I recommend [BTC Vault]( which will provide you with a ISO/ZIP that has Electrum on it. Now while I believe you could export your private keys from Multibit and import them into Electrum I would recommend against it. What would be best is to create the new Electrum wallet and then just send the coins in the Multibit wallet to the new Electrum one. Whatever you decide make sure that you make encrypt the wallets and make backups of both the Multibit and the Electrum wallets and DO NOT store these backups on the same USB/CD as the OS.

If the harddrive is not recognized by a new computer than we need more information. For instance when you try the drive does it make a clicking noise? does it even spin up? Have you looked into forensic hard drive recovery? Depending on the way the drive failed you may be able to do different things. For example if the drive is clicking then sometimes putting the drive in the freezer and letting it get cold can be a temporary fix. If the drive doesn't even spin up then it possible that transplanting a new circuit board from a working drive of the same model might work. Finally if there are enough bitcoins on the drive then forensics might be worth paying for.

It's only issue is that it tends to estimate the difficulty increase as being much higher than is realistic but it is good for a worst case guess.

If you absolutely cannot think of the password I would recommend that you make a backup of the encrypted wallet and then start a new one. That way you will have a wallet to use and then if you do happen to remember the password, perhaps after a nights rest, you can try again. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 03:30:12
True but according to their email it will both reserve the same spot for the 250GH miner and give potentially $2000 off. The relevant parts are reposted below.
* Upgrade protection built in to any Mars purchase with vouchers for up to $2000 off of any Jupiter purchase.
* Last but not least, any purchase of the Mars product automatically reserves you the same place in the order queue for the Jupiter product. The queue reservation will last 30 days.

If you have at least doubled your investment, then pull the amount that you invested back out. That way no matter what you are just back to where you were with pure fiat currency.
@_date: 2013-04-24 01:05:55
If you have forgotten the password to an encrypted wallet then your options are to either remember the password, brute force the password or recover a non encrypted backup of the wallet.
Edit: What client are you using?

[Here]( is about what you are looking at given the current difficulty and a moderate monthly increase. Depending on your power costs and shipping costs this might be slightly better or worse. Feel free to play with the numbers a bit and convince yourself of it's (lack of) profitability.
tl;dr you will almost certainly never reach profitability, and would be better off buying $3300 worth of bitcoins if you think they'll be worth more.

1. Mainly it's due to the instability in the fiat currencies of the world and a huge upswing in the amount of people hearing about bitcoin leading to people buying bitcoin on the exchanges and driving the prices up.
2. See my post here: 
3. [Bitmit]( is a good place to start.
4. I personally like Slush's Pool: mining.bitcoin.cz
5. Nothing other than making bitcoin blocks.
6. Only you can decide if you can afford to invest.
7. There will be a crash or at least a major correction, but it will not be the end of bitcoin. It may induce the stability that bitcoin needs to be a true currency.
8. Completely separate system.
9. Very, if nothing else than taxing when converting between BTC and USD.
10. Dwolla is very stable but slow (it can take nearly a week once you are verified). Bitinstant and Bitfloor are options for depositing cash but they have been flakey recently.

This is just a vocabulary problem "zero point zero zero five bitcoins" is "5 millibitcoin".  "zero point zero zero one seven five" is "1.75 millibitcoin". I could easily see the language adapt to have people just say 1 millibit or 1 nanobit. The point is that language is very flexible and people are great at coming up with the path of least resistance when talking.

It provides some anonymity, because it is not always perfectly clear whether the coins were sent to two recipients or one and yourself. It also helps to protect against someone determining the private key via a flawed (pseudo)random number generator, like what happened to the android wallets (see here:  because repeated use of the same address makes the flaw in the RNG easier to exploit.

Well either you found a flaw in their random number generation (you should contact them and let them know by the way) in which case they would be able to correct it.

Oh they would sell it if they had it, bitcoin is extremely volatile at the moment. By running a few and selling the majority they get to have stable (by comparison) cash to pay for R&amp;D and the benefit of a bitcoin based income, plus the good will of the community in buying future models.

@_date: 2013-04-12 00:41:17
I'm hoping it'll tank, i'm looking to buy some cheap coins.
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:35:55
Can you post links to the transactions?
@_date: 2013-04-13 13:37:51
Thank you that's all I wanted.

I used it today for a cash to Mt gox transaction and got confirmation before the cashier could even print my receipt. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:05:50
What wallet were you using, and do you have any way of access files on it?
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:43:33
You will never get even a small subset of people to agree to such a thing. Sorry to say.

33,900 Ghash/sec is ~56% more than current this would mean an eventual difficulty of approximately 1.56 times the current so 11,969,880 final difficult barring other changes. But this won't happen all at once and it won't be instantly adjusted.

For small amounts  may be the way to go, if you can find someone near you.
@_date: 2013-06-02 18:02:22
Alright, hopefully i'll get this one.

No the software surrounding bitcoin currently is having some growing pains bitcoin itself is very solid.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:14:10
Just sent .1 BTC, Best of luck!

Centi- Milli- and Micro- are not confusing if you are used to the metric system. Thankfully the vast majority of the world already uses it every day.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:50:02
0000-0099 Done. Is that all from 0000-0999?
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:48:00
Yep, don't know what to tell you. It worked perfectly for me but then again this was just before they started to have massive problems so it is possible they changed it. Best of luck in getting things sorted out!
@_date: 2013-06-02 20:43:48
indeed i was thinking programing, numerical bases, then i got an element as a hint and have no clue what to do with it.
@_date: 2013-07-04 06:33:14
I wonder if something like Lookout would catch the change? 
@_date: 2013-05-19 22:14:14
I got it! Very good trivia game. Swept 0.117 BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:04:02
