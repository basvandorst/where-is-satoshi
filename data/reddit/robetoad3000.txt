Idk, could be fun.

From my understanding, yes. This is why Schnorr is supposed to help with anonymity. 10 users can throw their payments in to a big pot and send out to 10 other users. It would be extremely difficult to trace which input paid to which output. I’m not super technically adept, so this may not be the best/most accurate way of describing it though.
Edit: Here’s where I read that (specifically, the section on privacy): 
Edit 2: Just re-reading it now. Seems like this function already exists via CoinJoin, but Schnorr is likely to incentivize more of these transactions since it will allow those 10 sigs to be combined into 1 — meaning a smaller transaction size/lower fees.

Yeah, I registered a couple days after Christmas and was verified just after the new year. I have no idea why it takes so long for so many people here. I definitely seem to be in the minority of people getting verified in about a week though.

They simply copied over the Copay wallet (open source) verbatim and threw their branding on top. I’m sure they have little incentive to change this feature for other reasons, but it’s also just cheap for them to make zero changes to the wallet.

P.s. I believe Jan 15th is the date others have mentioned bonuses being distributed.

It could go either way though. Mine only took 6 days.

I first heard it talked about by Paul Puey on the Bitcoin News Show just a day or two ago. But yeah, it’s ridiculous.

And, if you can’t set a custom fee in Airbitz to do this, just download Edge Wallet. It’s just the new Airbitz wallet revamped and rebranded. You can use your same login credentials and any funds will show up in Edge when you log in. Then you’ll be able to set a custom fee and send your funds wherever you want!

Just in 5 states for now I believe.

Well, you could have sent all your coins to one wallet from the exchange, then accidentally sent them to the wrong address when trying to move them again. Not sure how that would hold up, but it’s certainly possible. Or you got scammed, lost the private keys, etc.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:15:39
Totally agree. I like Trace Mayer’s model:

Have you checked out Angel List? I haven’t noticed many in Boston, but it’s a good place to keep an eye out.

Any recommendations?

Well, assuming you had enough USD, or whatever, for the pizza, he’s saying to buy with your BTC, and put that USD “pizza money” back in to BTC immediately.

I believe it is a snack vending machine. Have one at work with a similar interface.

Things aren’t always perfect, but you’re remain positive, don’t give up, and in the past, it has always worked out for both of you. That’d be a happy marriage, I think ;)

I’m really liking Edge Wallet so far, and I feel they are trustworthy, as I used their former product, Airbitz, for about 2 years. Supports Segwit, multiple currencies, hold your private keys, ability to split wallets when forks happen, etc. Nice UX too.
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:57:43
Agreed that it looks a little confusing this way, but obviously innovators is intended to be a subsection of early adopters.

Thanks for reply — and that makes a lot more sense!
But in that case, the price tag would be a bit out of many people’s budget I think. I can see the value and ease of use potential, but I think I’d rather just use a hardware wallet/hot wallet combo.
If you are eventually able to mass produce these and get the price down closer to $150-$175, I can see this really taking off.
Best of luck! I’ll be keeping an eye on this for sure.
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:20:25
Honestly, looks really cool! How are you giving it away at $20 though? Makes me feel uneasy.
