We are over 10k transactions behind. That's only data from my ~400 connected nodes. They filled up the pool good.
@_date: 2015-06-23 11:53:50
You don't actually have a balance. You have the keys to create a transaction, using an unspent output of another transaction. The "balance" is nothing more than the total of the unspent transaction outputs. If you cut off the blockchain, every transaction before the cutoff will be gone, ie. the transaction output will not exist and as a consequence, your total amount of unspent transaction outputs just went down.
@_date: 2015-06-23 13:28:26
What if I manually create block3 and say that my unspent outputs were just cut off? How would you tell that my coins actually were mined and not created by me? If you can't trace a transaction all the way back to it's coinbase transaction, you can't know if it was mined or created in some other way.
@_date: 2015-06-22 12:11:02
My node has over 7k unconfirmed right now, so I guess so...
[14:16] Over 9k now. 2k+ in 5 minutes
[14:37] The big guys are no longer "spamming", still a backlog of at least over 8k tx
[16:17] Unconfirmed transaction still hovering above 10k
[16:35] 6 blocks mined the last 20 minutes, ~8000 unconfirmed
[16:48] blockchain.info kneeling under the pressure? Missing the latest 2 blocks (362046/47), and not pushing new unconfirmed transactions to my webhooks.
[18:16] Starting to catch up again, just over 4.1k unconfirmed. 
[21:10] Someone is still sending a lot of transactions with 14 outputs, pool at almost 6.5k unconfirmed.
[22:10] Heading towards 10k unconfirmed again. Some bad luck with blocks.

Day 2: [07:46] What did we learn? My media center is better connected, and can handle congested transactions better than blockchain.info. Those guys need to get their shit together.
I made a standard transaction from my Android wallet, 0.01 btc transferred, and it took a few hours to confirm, with 10k unconfirmed in pool.
It's really easy for someone with a lot of money to make sure standard transactions "never" confirm by setting high fees. 
1MB blocks are not adequate.

Maybe it's just me, but I feel that it's overly strict all together. I see the problem though, no two countries have the same laws regarding these issues. But I think for your service sake that it would be better, if possible, to refer to local legislation, rather than taking the most strict law and setting that as the rule.
* You must be the original creator of the image
* A valid model release is required **for any person visible** in your files
* Images must not include logos or protected trademarks
* Images must not include buildings, goods or places protected by intellectual property rights
This is also very confusing when followed by
* Details are important and one should try to avoid doubtful images. One might ask themselves “If I went to this place, met this person, or saw this work of art, would I recognize it/them from this image?” If you answer NO to this question then you should be safe. However if you answer 'Yes' you might need to investigate if the item is protected by privacy or copyright.

Aha! Because I'm not claiming they aren't related. I'm saying that the one did not cause the other. OP saw a picture of a female and made the assumption that that person has a set of characteristics that causes said person to express themselves in a certain way, and therefore, the assumed fact that characteristics *cause* certain expressions (in f.ex looks) OP made the false assumption that this person must have characteristics based on looks.
The burden of proof is on the one claiming causation, because you can have a 1 to 1 correlation without having causation either way.

Isn't that how you track the killer..?
@_date: 2015-06-23 19:34:04
Lets think about that word for a moment. "Balance". Weights on both sides of a scale. In a ledger, you have a balance, in your pocket you have money. You can convert between the two, but they are not the same. Your money is just that, money. It's not a balance. A balance is the result of a chain of transfers and IOU's and UOMe's. Bitcoin can never be money in that sense.
So to answer your question, the balance **is** stored. It's stored in the blockchain and calculated by looking at all the previous transactions. So the question is not really the one you want to ask. You want to know if we could convert a bitcoin balance into a "money". And you can, just use bitcoin to buy gold or paper fiat or something you deem to have value.

Nobody should be excluded. That's why we have spv wallets.

Some people in some places won't be able to run full nodes, tough luck.

So there is no main chain anymore, all forks have 0 value and all miners stop mining. I don't think this will happen. People want money, and by that simple fact, miners will maintain a healthy fully distributed main chain rather than mine their own fork until they go bankrupt.

And you know damn well that most people reading your statement who does not want to or know how to dig deeper into the issue will assume that instantly after 75% mine 101 blocks, 8MB blocks will be mined.

Right now we are also working and making assumptions within our parameters, which means that everything we do depends on consensus rules that we know for a fact will have to change.

So what you are telling me, is that somebody is going to fill up my 64GB mempool with transactions that have such a high fee that they will push out all other transactions, and they are going to do this every 10 minutes.
This is also assuming that we cannot make code that will drop a tx from the mempool when it's full in case a new one comes in with a higher fee/size ratio than another one in the pool.

More or less. Since miners have full control over themselves (duh) they won't just start creating insane blocks. Chinese pools already said they won't support over 8MB blocks, so we can safely assume that 60% of the blocks won't be over that.
The rest of the miners are going to make a decision if they want to risk creating a block that 60% of the mining power are going to orphan by default, and might be orphaned by the rest simply because propagation is terrible because of it's size.
Read it when you have the time, it's really good!
The quickest takeaway is that over time there is a point where the risk of orphan is greater than the profit of including a transaction with insufficient fee. So miners will try to hit that point because it's the most profitable. This point will naturally increase with developing network speed and stability.
@_date: 2015-08-07 09:12:45
Tell me, why are they not spending that right now?
If somone wants to destroy bitcoin that bad, spending that kind of cash right now would totally destroy every node in the network because the pool would never shrink.
Look at how many services went down when the mempool grew to 100MB, and how long it took to clear. If "they" wanted to destroy bitcoin as badly as suggested, why not push 100TB worth of tx's with 100sat/B fee right now?
I cannot see a reason why removing the size limit would incentivize clogging the network. Rather the opposite since it's so easy now WITH the limit.
@_date: 2015-08-07 12:52:14
1 ok.
2 ok.
3 still ok
4 not gonna happen. 50% orphan costs too much. But I'll take the bait.
1 Hard-drives are a non issue. Cheap and gets larger and cheaper. And pruning will happen soon too.
2 I don't see the issue. Your computer doesn't handle it's memory?

Did you read this? 
I consider myself an above average tech guy (being a professional programmer and all) and I have no issues with spending hundreds of bucks on storage if it came to that. I firmly do believe that there exists at least a couple thousands more of "me" across the globe.
The network simply wouldn't become 100GB blocks over night, because the block would just orphan. I really do believe we could just remove the limit all together and it would sort itself out because miners won't risk orphan blocks by including billions of transactions. (read the paper)

That's the thing. It's no longer a bitcoin, so it's value is irrelevant. It's a local fork, and bitcoin would continue along the main chain.
The miner can pack it up or rejoin the main chain again.

Wouldn't you agree that in the current situation, it would be better if core merged BIP101 and reviewed and tested the code on it's own merits, and looked past any arguments regarding node operators limited hardware/bandwidth? If the market wants BIP101, core is better off implementing it and testing it now, rather than later.
Like it or not, open software has to adapt a lot faster than closed proprietary code or the market moves around it. I'd switch back to core in a heartbeat if all this would be taken a bit more seriously than just pretending it doesn't exist/is an altcoin/[insert argument here].

Cool read. I even understood most of the words!
Correct me if I'm wrong, but if all miners provided their relevant data (network speed, lag, etc) and we used, say, bitcoinaverage to get current USD value, we could use this math to at any given time calculate with almost 100% certainty what USD value fee a transaction would need to pay for it's size to be included in the next block at any given miner, given it's the last transaction to reach that miner before it finds a block. Yes? No?
@_date: 2015-08-06 15:00:09
No. It will accept it as the longest chain until it isn't anymore, and then orphan it. The block also can't be considered invalid, because that's up to the node to decide. For him it's valid, for most other nodes, not.

I have noticed that with some apps, when receiving btc on the latest generated address, via another app with access to the xpub key, the original app with the private key for the next address will not always be generated because the app itself did not get the payment.
I solved this by sending i tiny amount to the original app on the latest address, and then it generated the next one and the missing transaction showed up.

Why do you think a miner would make a 1TB block? And do you think that if that happened tomorrow(after consensus removal of limit), it would not just orphan?
And with no limit on size, the spam would need to pay high enough fees to fill the entire profit-space in a block up to where it would not be profitable for a miner to risk orphan by including more transactions. That would cost millions very quickly

A bubble is possible, but just because the rate of generated bitcoin is halved does not mean the price will double. Only a portion of the traded BTC come from miners. When you have a lake full of water, decreasing the incoming flow won't suddenly halve the available water.
I kind of hope for a small crash in mining. It would be better for the network if the huge miners die, and mining at home with an Antminer or two is really attractive.

Looks like the pattern has changed. First it was a huge amount of microscopic transactions with a lot of outputs.
Now its a single input, 3 output transaction, and it looks like they are pushed in a more steady pace, not bombarded all at once.

Not probably, potentially. If someone saw it happen, they could double spend their coins, but I guess most transactions were included in the valid block or one after.
@_date: 2015-08-07 10:45:59
For the attack to be successful, wouldn't the recipient of the payment have to be using an SPV wallet and accept payments with very few confirmations? So either the value of the transaction is irrelevant and accepted with 0-1 confirmations, or it's a significant value transaction, and the recipient is using a full node wallet and waits for 6+ confs.

Using RawTransaction you can easily create and send transactions without having the private key in the node wallet. Point is, a lot of people are doing this, and with RBF, they would all replace each other until the transaction is 100% fee, and therefore, there would be no point anymore, at least up to a certain point.

If I have 10 times more btc than you, it makes no difference if we add more decimal places or more 0s. I still have 10 times more than you.
If we had to add more precision to bitcoin it would be because 1 satoshi had a higher value than what we would consider a reasonable minimum. 10 million satoshis will then just be called 10 billion bitoshi or whatever we call it. Still the same value.

Just a suggestion, would it maybe be an idea to count missing and invalid votes as current = current*1.x?
As I understand it, a lot of pool operators are in the "set and forget" mindset, so readjusting might just not happen at all for a lot of pool miners. The default should be growth.
For the record I'm personally 100% against this BIP, but I'm not consensus, so if it happens it happens. Better make sure it's the best it can be.

Actually, assuming linear growth with 3 points, now and +-20 years, we should have somewhere around 1 Exabyte HDDs. Not realistic, but says something about the growth from then to now in terms of scale.

You sure? The ddos started just around the time we hit 8/x bip101 blocks. I can't remember, but while it wasn't the last 80/1000, it could have been the last 8/100, but then stopped because of ddos. Like I said, I don't remember exactly, so feel free to prove me wrong. 
Downvotes, really? I already admitted to being wrong.

Because they didn't want to upgrade their sql from 2008 because they wanted the latest version to have more testing behind it first, but 2008 didn't have that one great function they needed so they programmed their own version that is now impossible to port, even though sql 2015 has that functionality in a much better form.
Why yes, I do work in programming..

Why would 50 people on one project be better than 10 people on 5 projects? In the end one, and only one person, can make the final decision whether or not to include a change on a given project. I say more different projects is the best for decentralization.

Here is the CSS they made
"5) Add CSS that hides the moderation from most users."
*The fifth option was the one I went with. It makes moderation invisible and allows us to keep good posts up that we would have otherwise had to delete. Most importantly, it solves the problem of good everyday posters seeing a line of [deleted] and thinking that we are trying to hide something from them.*

Sure it is. Everything in the world works like that when there isn't a 100% agreement. If I had commit access to core and put something in, then you removed it, and I added it again, we could go on forever until someone stepped in and made a decision. And for argument sake, lets assume we have exactly 50% of the core devs on each our sides.

Nothing. But how are you going to regulate every dude or dudette in the world that runs miners at home? 
@_date: 2015-09-02 06:06:20
The notion of size of a miner is really strange to me. The largest miners are the Chinese pools, but they have terrible Internet. A small European miner is probably a LOT stronger, both in terms of better Internet, and better pay from whatever other job they have to keep up with hardware and such.

*Each transaction input requires at least 41 bytes for the previous transaction reference and other headers and each transaction output requires an additional 9 bytes of headers. Finally every transaction has a header at least 10 bytes long. Added up we get 166 bytes for the minimum-sized Bitcoin transaction. For 1MB (1,000,000 byte) blocks this implies a* ***theoretical maximum rate of 10tx/s.***

You can literally say what you just said about the internet if you go far enough back.
"Only criminals" used the internet in the beginning. But then everyone realized it's potential.
I want bitcoin because when I shop online, it's easier to scan a QR code with my phone, than it is to submit all my CC info that might not be accepted because some sites don't accept Scandinavian specific letters that I have 2 of in my full name, and sites get hacked all the time, and CC info is leaked like it was in style. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 20:32:42
So who decides the cutoff for consensus? 75? 95? 100? We can't even get consensus on what consensus is without someone making that decision. 
@_date: 2015-09-03 06:05:02
If it reaches that, I think actually everyone uses it. You're thinking about running full nodes, and if/when this happens, I think enough people that already have internet and hardware to support it today, will still be running full nodes.
@_date: 2015-09-04 15:49:41
Good, you took the bait. CoinWallet has just created that fee market before our eyes. Also, since you did some math, who do you think will use bitcoin when the fee is 30 usd, and the blocks are so congested that the speed of checks are to bitcoin what bitcoin is to checks today? And if everyone uses sidechains or LN, then why use bitcoin at all?

Depends on your definition, but the US does not have even remotely close to enough healthy food for the entire population, and high fructose corn syrup is insanely subsidized and stuffed into more or less everything you buy. 70% of the population is either obese or overweight.
