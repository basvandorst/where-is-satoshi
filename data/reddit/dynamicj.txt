Oddly specific.

Yeah, that's rude.

What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.

Sears food at 1500 deg f. A friend of mine has one, pretty awesome but not worth 900 USD.

OP is talking about how many newcomers purchased BTC and it's still pending before they even have access to their newly purchased BTC.

You could be like me and keep a tracker widget on your home screen of your phone that updates itself every 90 seconds with current price. I think I'm about to have a heart attack, or start drinking again. Not sure which.

Ever *had* HIV?

So I *am* doing this right!

Pretty sure 27% of the people I know don't even know about Bitcoin.

You're not going in the correct department.

Read in his voice. Dead on.
