The core part of 2018 Crypto Crash starts once the following price levels are crossed below to the downside:
BTC/USD (Bitfinex): $11,651
BTC/USD (Coinbase): $12,500
Afterwards, the crash then accelerates with terminal velocity when the lows of 22 Dec 2017 are crossed to the downside.
At which point many exchanges may likely experience outages, preventing fund deposits/withdrawals and the closing/opening of positions. Slippages on stops/limits may also occur.

Was inclined to believe it will bounce after the crash.
However, currently looking deeper into the fractal formation of the lower degree waves and it doesn't look too positive.
Need more data to unfold and will post findings if my bloody posts and username is voted into positive territory!
