You think an average user gives a shit about Segwit or BU? All they want is their transaction processed ASAP at possibly lower fees, period. 
This will only confuse them and make them wait longer (till the selected miner processes the transaction). Not to mention higher transaction fees.

Really? You think an average user would pay high fees and wait longer for confirmation to support a miner? They don't even give a rat's ass about this Segwit vs BU debate.

True. They chose Telegram for other reasons. From their [github page](


* Available for all popular platforms
* Contains rich bot API
* Fast, reliable, and secure
* Works perfect with slow/poor Internet connection
* Staff and support are developer-friendly
* More likely to fight for LibreTaxi rights when it comes to regulations (Germany/EU jurisdiction)

Same can be said about small blockers. Spreading FUD hoping BCH will crash.
