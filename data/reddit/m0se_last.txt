..but at least the bitcoin companies had options to avoid that (Multisig+HW-Wallet). I would have expected SWIFT also working with some kind of HW-Token,.. but from the story it seems they just have credential that can be stolen and used by maleware.

In the case of Bitstamp fee calculation there is a catch that increases the fee a little per transaktion. 
From the FAQ: "The rounding up is executed in such a way, that the second decimal digit is always one digit value higher than it was before the rounding up. For example; a fee of 0.111 will be charged as 0.12."

Hm,..very nice to see something happening here, but the exchange rate don't seems very attractive... even compared to sending money from my CHF bank account to Bitstamp with converting to USD is giving me better conditions.
And the other wired thing making it even less attractive is the following quote from the FAQ: "The price is defined at the time we receive your payment."

sure, it can be,... if you choose to use it that way,.. but you don't have to.

ok, maybe I should have put it a bit nicer, it does read a bit like "if you can't code fuck off". I'm sorry for that. But I'm not sure how a truly trustless system is possible without being able to audit what it does.
On the practicality of auditing, you only need to read code your self if you execute one of this programs for the first time and there is no collective experience with this particular program you trust. 
It's actually the same thing with bitcoin, why is bitcoin trustless for you (I assume it is)? 
Because of our consistent collective experience we have with it or did you read the code your self to make sure?
But the "programs" run on etehereum we are talking about (which by your wish should not be called by name) are much much simpler then the actual source code of the ethereum platform or of bitcoin. 
They are basically short bits of business logic, that don't take a hard core coder to understand. Anyone of moderate intelligence can learn this, if true trustlessnes is needed. (assuming you trust the platform itself, else as in the case of bitcoin you do need to be a hardcore coder and read the platform code yourself,.. if your standard for trustlessnes really is that high)

sorry, i'm not getting the fun in that,.. care to expand? is it laughable to think that some people are able to audit source code by them self,.. or is it the idea that one can find a trust-able person wit coding skills.
@_date: 2016-03-02 08:40:03
Not really, if the source code is available, on which you always should insist, you can audit the code or if your not able, bring in someone who you trust who can.

Looks awesome, but do I understand this correctly, you will expose all your data to this Airtable-service thing?  ..or can you self-host the hold thing?

Adblockers are great, surfing without is very annoying these days. If you actually care about content creators you could start using ProTip.is and help build a different model of revenue for writers and journalist. 
This kind of "free internet" isn't actually free, we pay with our attention,.. and I rather spend a few cents in bitcoin!

Thanks for clarifying,.. that's what I suspected. That would have been something to set this solution apart from the "pre done" solutions mentioned above. As my issue with does is that I would expose information about my assets to operators of this service. 
I guess in that case I gonna stick with my LibreOffice/JSON-API mess...

Electrum actually also works on android, but there definitively are better wallets if you looking for a mobile wallet. The desktop version is really nice and simple.

For me it was the opposite way around. I didn't receive this mail at my localbitcoins address, but on the address I use for BTCJam (and other sites, so can't say it's BTCJam with certainty).
But I wounder if this is from the same db-leak as the PanteraCapitalInvest scam mail a week a go,.. at least it hit the same address in my case...
@_date: 2015-09-08 12:13:28
Did everyone receive the same "deposit address" or did they use individual ones?
If it's all the same, nobody send any coins so far ;D
Thats the address I got: 1ZVYLrZqiGjbfRnmzqPUw9TG6wufy1eds

..and when you double that again, you'v found the correct answer to not only  the question how much to hold,.. but to life, the univers and everything ;D
@_date: 2015-02-04 13:33:59
I'd be happy to have one,.. I've been waiting for the invite-only phase to end for some time now. I played around with Onename.io which is nice, but very limited,.. it would be interesting for me to checkout keybase xD

Keep in mind, when using this services - you can also hold the private keys yourself, with a desktop or mobile wallet. Coinbase and Changetip are holding your bitcoins for you and could run off with your coins since they (and not you) control the private keys. Blockchain.info is as far as I know a bit better in this regard as the keys are kept on your site - but still all it would only take is a slight modification in the code of there service to steal your keys and coins. So to really benefit of the freedom and independence of bitcoin you need to take the responsibility your self and you should make sure that you, only you and no one else holds or has access to your private keys.
