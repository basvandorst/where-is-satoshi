I don't really think that this certificate holds any value, -- or is it associated with a university? Anyone can print a paper like this.

? Look at his wallet.
It is HD which didnt exist in 2013.
this post is definitely fake.

You can try it yourself. Download Bitcoin Core v12.0 ( or any version below v.16 and run it with usehd = 0 ),  [ generate a wallet,
then copy the wallet.dat into your v18.0 wallet dir, and it'll look like this;  [

This is fake. As you can see bottom right it says “HD” wallet.
Hd wallets were NOT introduced until bitcoin core 13.0.
They were introduced in 2016, not 13.
OP is? a liar since this wallet is at most 3 years old.

With bitcoin core you are the node
@_date: 2019-07-02 14:40:39
Yep. Impossible.
You cant convert a keypool wallet into a HD wallet. (Atleast not that i know of.)
Op’s a liar.

You can, but i'm pretty sure it would show up like this; [

Usually manufacturers of watches make only x amount of watch y, meaning that, over time, there'll be less of these watches ( as people break them, lose them etc), and thus usually becoming worth more for collectors etc.

It is an exchange adress for sure.

That they generate way more blocks = block rewards = "bitcoin" cash = inflation compared to bitcoin

No, i don't think such a mechanism is build into bitcoin core, and it wouldn't really make sense if there were one.
What's your idea of a fairly strong password? But yes, bruteforce would indeed be possible, especially if you know certain characters that are used.

What would be the difference between bitcoin core and electrum in the first place?

i do not understand why people want bitcoin unlimited. Can anyone explain?

Looks great, but the reality is that BTCTOP, AntPool, ViaBTC, and BTC.com can all be traced back to bitmain.
I believe two of those pools were even under direct control of bitmain, and sort of split up after their hash capacity exceeded 50%.

it's not. It's just that all the other exchanges fake their volumes.

Why would the yield of treasure bonds go down if foreign banks are selling off their bonds?
Shouldn’t supply x demand = higher yield rates on the bonds?

You’re right about being *slightly* worried about Exodus, but for the wrong reasons. Exodus does not know your private key, but since they’re a closed-sourced wallet, there could be a lot of things wrong with their code that may allow for leakings of sensitive information in the future.
It might be best to switch to a open-sourced wallet such as Electrum (SPV), or Bitcoin core to maximize your security.

Do you have to be a cop to tell if something is a crime?

you know you're in a cryptocurrency sub when you have to explain the existence of inflation to people
