Yeah, they'll have a hard time if there are emails to back up death threats being made against employees though.
For instance, I have a work laptop, but it is kept at my house. I work for a fortune 500 company. Using company funds to purchase an item, and then allowing an employee to keep that item in their home doesn't necessarily indicate that it was for "personal use." It just means that the employee may use that item at home for work related purposes (in this case, self defense due to relationship with the company).
I also wonder about the "mining before shipping." They're being very careful to refer to it as a burnin test which is common in a lot of hardware production. But usually they have guidelines on how long hardware should be tested before shipping (when we used to build radiology workstations company policy dictated we burn in all equipment for a period of 2 days which was documented and sent to the customer so they knew it was tested as working prior to receipt). 
If they didn't keep logs, it looks really bad. If they didn't have a written policy about how long to burnin, it also looks really bad. If they have both, it's just good industry practice.
A lot of the stuff here in the article could go either way during discovery.

Apparently they are private issued shares. The company is a joint stock company. It looks like they will send you a written confirmation of equity in the company which is valid when they are listed on a public stock exchange.
From the help page at beesfund:
**In what form do I receive shares in the business?**
Depending on the form of legal entity seeking capital, there are two possible equity crowdfunding models:
* for a limited liabilitiy company, the appropriate ownership method is shares. If they are offered in return for funding on a project, then the detailed information about their distribution will also be posted;
* for a joint stock company, the apprpriate ownership method is stock. If a user acquires stock via beesfund.com, they will recieve a mailed confirmation of the acquired stock and the amount.
 
Stock and shares, acquired via beesfund.com are binded by the laws and duties described by the Kodeks Spółek Handlowych and other legal regulations.
 
Stockholders have rights, which include; the right for a share in the profits, right to take part and vote at shareholder meetsing, as well as many other rights.
 
Detailed terms and conditions, laws, and duties for both parties will be regulated by an greement available wiht each equity crowd financing project. We pay special attention that the format of the agreement between the investor and the author is as similar as possible for all projects!
 
**Can I sell my acquired stock or shares?**
If the agreement between the beesfund.com user and the author doesn't have any restrictions, then there are no barriers from doing so.
 
A more detailed guide will be published soon.
**What rights in the business do I have as a result of the stock or shares purchased on beesfund.com?**
Users who acquire stock or shares in companies via beesfund.com will have their rights clearly defined in the agreement between the parties, as well as in other legal and regulatory statutes which are binding in Poland, such as those stated by the Kodeks Spółek Handlowych. A detailed description of the laws and obligations of both parties will soon be published.
**When I want to acquire stock, is it necessary to visit a notary?**
No. The process by which you acquire stock via beesfund.com doesn't require the presence of a notary.
Once a project is completed, and funds are transferred, the buyer will recieve a document which confirms the stock purchase and its amount. This is sufficient proof of ownership.
 
**Are there any additional costs I need to incur when acquiring stock on beesfund.com?**
No. Additional costs (eg: change of ownership, postage for sending of documents, comission for beesfund.com etc) are included in the price paid on beesfund.com. However, the above mentioned costs do mean that the company does not get the full amount raised on the platform.
 
**What is the guarantee that the author or company will honor my rights as an equity holder?**
The rights and responsibilities of the parties are regulated by the agreement between the investor and company. It's contents is known to both parties before the agreement is made. The beesfund.com team takes care of the quality of the projects and the reliability of the companies ability to honor their agreemet so that there is no abuse from either side.

Alright, I'm going to ask about this because I was concerned about getting rated down to hell. I am long with bitcoin, and the answer won't probably change that (so don't think I'm spreading FUD). Can anyone give me a list of the factors currently driving down the bitcoin price? Is it a normal market correction after the late 2013 hype-fest? There seems to be tons of good news about bitcoin which should be driving things up, but instead we're hitting price levels similar to the MtGox times.

I've been tracking this thread here too:
I'm considering cutting the amount I earn from mining that gets converted into fiat down a little bit which should let me buy a trading share once a week. It's not a get rich quick scheme, but I feel it could help maximize returns from mining, especially during the chaos that's going on right now as cryptos mature. We'll see how it goes.

Ultimately, it's your decision. But it also sounds like you sometimes trade on your emotions - your emotions are your enemies. We've all made that mistake on the market.
But, do you really think bitcoin, with all of the corporate support and funds being developed around it, will suddenly disappear tomorrow? Do you think all of those underground markets will suddenly disappear? Do you think overstock will suddenly stop paying out bonuses in bitcoin?
Markets fluctuate, sometimes wildly. This could be a correction, it could be manipulation. But it's doubtful that bitcoin will suddenly disappear.

Bitcoin also still has some tinge of "illegitimacy" because of the SR thing. A lot of folks can't quite separate the illegality that actually helped BTC get off the ground. It's not bitcoin's fault - but to this day a lot of people think that way.
For a business in a questionable market that is struggling for legitimacy, this could be a real concern. These businesses have to dot their I's and cross their T's to a level most businesses will never understand - anything that would award them additional scrutiny will probably be something they'd shy away from.

Actually, I do view it as an investment.
It empowers me to take part in investments I normally can't access because of startup capital restrictions (being an accreddited/certified investor requires 1m in assets, and an annual income of 200k a year). 
With bitcoin, I can issue loans to people without having to worry about complying with regulatory requirements. I can directly invest in a starting business without accreditation. I can take part in a number of unregulated funds. I can directly provide liquidity for margin lending. I can enjoy the chance to play in markets that make normal forex markets seem tame. None of these would be possible without bitcoin or other cryptos.
So, yeah, it is empowering me to earn fiat money (if I ever need it to).
So, yeah, it is an investment. In your terms, me + my financial knowledge + cryptocurrency providing an avenue to actually flex said knowledge = surplus(fiat currency).

What you're suggesting isn't a bad idea, but you run into a number of problems, namely there's already a working standard. Essentially what you're looking for has already been implemented in SIP using the sip: URI (and arguably the tel URI).
There's nearly no way this could be used to route phone calls; the blockchain doesn't move nearly fast enough. In our network we require an SLA of sub 120ms for round trip call signalling. I doubt you'd ever be able to get that out of the blockchain.

Not really, you don't have to. The fact that people for some reason refuse to use multi-sig transactions is crazy to me. Localbitcoin should never hold the coins. They each party should generate a private/public key, then localbitcoin can generate a multi-sig address using those keys, have the buyer send coins there, and when they receive the item/coins, the buyer/localbitcoin sign off on the transaction. If localbitcoin goes belly up, the buyer and the seller sign off on the transaction. If the buyer goes unresponsive after a set amount of time, localbitcoin and the seller sign off on the transaction. Multisig lets you do escrow without ever letting the coins sit in a wallet at some escrow place.

For the most part. There are absolutely places where the free market fails (when the US owned the Philippines in the early 1900s is a great example - own the media and start selling people diseased meat - they have to eat, and word can't get out because there is no media to carry the message, so the market can't move). For the most part though the free market will figure its shit out.
@_date: 2014-09-22 14:02:05
Yeah, but the market should still be the primary driver. Given all of the good news lately, there should be a higher demand. That would be the logical conclusion. Instead we're seeing lots of people dumping and the price is falling. There has to be a reason for people to dump, you know?
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:10:12
This is pretty much correct.
When your average person thinks of a stock/security price, they think that it's just some magic price set in front of them.
What it actually is is a function of something called "order books" - buy orders and sell orders. These exist at every exchange. If you remember back to economics class when they taught you about supply and demand, this are literally supply and demand. Buy orders are demand - people who want to buy. Sell orders are supply - people who want to sell. Where they meet in the middle is the market price. Equilibrium.
If there are a huge number of people who want to buy at a certain price (or just one person with a huge amount of money), people can keep selling and selling but they won't "break through" that price.
Same thing when there are tons of people selling or one big person selling at a particular price. People can keep buying and buying but the market price won't go anywhere.
It all really does come down to supply and demand... once you understand how they work (and cryptos are a GREAT place to see it in action), almost everything in investing starts to make sense.

Technically in the US most crimes require 2 things for a crime to be charged:
1) Mens rea - literally "criminal mind." You had to have a criminal intent. 
2) Corpus delecti - literally "body of the crime." There has to be evidence that a crime has actually taken place.
If one or both of these is absent, often no crime will ever be pursued.
If you did something by accident, it's hard to prove mens rea exists. A really prickish DA could try to argue that you were willfully negligent by using bitcoin, but that would probably not make it very far. Especially if, upon finding out what happened, you cooperated to the best of your abilities with the authorities. Given your intent was to pay for something and not to fund ISIS, you certainly had no intention to commit a crime.

Just to throw in, this is actually the reason why very minimal inflation is actually a good thing in economics (oh god I'm going to get rated down for saying that). If someone knows prices will go up, they're incentivized to buy things now.
A deflationary market actually reduces spending because there's a good chance if I don't buy product X today, I can get it cheaper tomorrow. And then tomorrow, I go through the same thought exercise, so on and so forth. 
The only exception are staple goods that MUST be purchased at the time they're needed (food is a good example).

The fact that you're asking this question means that you're probably not the best equipped *right now* to handle the sudden influx of money.

As of last year (the last time I was in the Netherlands) outside of Amsterdam tourist spots it was very difficult to use a non chip/pin card.

I disagree. Your argument is that the average Joe has a chance to get coins at a low price and that that defeats inequality of ownership, unless I am misunderstanding you (which is entirely possible).
The fact is, there is no way for average people/investors to get a fair stake in the bitcoin game at this point.

So, suppose the coins are mined - do I do first in-first out for the coins when spending? I'm not tracking individual coins - they're just kind of coins in the pot, you know?
As for the loan - if I take out a loan on btcjam to receive bitcoins to pay for a service and immediately pay for that service using those bitcoins, is that taxable? I then have to make payments back on that loan in bitcoin. Since I am paying on a loan + interest, is that all taxable?
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:20:29
Oh I agree with you about 95% of the way. 
But I also think a lot of people simply had no idea that bitcoin existed back when there was a "good" chance to get in. I personally had never even heard of it until a slashdot article showed up when BTC hit parity with $1 (US). There's no choice when people have no way to participate.
I just bought another btc today, btw. Also setting aside another 200 to buy about 20$ worth of btc a day for the next few days until the market stabilizes.
I agree this is a great opportunity, but I don't think it in any way creates equal ownership. Agree to disagree? :)

Bear means a positive market (securities are going up in value). Bear means the market is down.
This is based on betting on the blood sports bull and bear baiting a long long time ago. When bulls fight, they put their horns down. When bears fight, they stand up.
A whale is a large holder of any particular security. Someone who, by the act of selling, influences the market. When your average person sees a stock price, they think that that number just comes out of the sky somehow. You know how in basic economics they say "as supply goes up, price goes down, and as supply goes down, price goes up?" Same applies here. If they have enough bitcoin they can dump all of them on the market and send the price plummeting.

Totally true. But usually the testers don't say "this part broke" and hand it back to the engineers. They will provide exactly what test case they were running, what test deck it was part of, all of the parameters of how they were running it, and if any other test cases related to it failed. And that's just for systems engineering. In the case of development there are stack traces, exception dumps, and so on.
They don't just kick the can back and say "fix it."

I'm not sure - 
how does the SEC treat stock buybacks? Is the company only limited to buying/selling after an announcement period, or can they continually buy/sell their own stock to maintain a price level?
Stock buybacks are directly manipulating the price of a stock by taking lots of shares off the market, thus driving up share price.

Not really. Nothing there is inherently bad without evidence showing actual malfeasance. Burn-in testing is common in hardware production (especially with integrated circuits because 1 wafer of silicon can go from perfect quality to horriffic, so usually each one is tested). Purchasing firearms for company use is not uncommon and not illegal. Storing company property offsite at an employee's home is not uncommon or illegal.
Basically, the context is what is important here, and that should all come out in discovery.
By no stretch am i defending BFL, I think they're guilty as sin. But this isn't necessarily damning if they have evidence backing up everything they say (like written burn in policies, and logs showing they stuck to those policies).

Not really true. You often include additional features that may be partially baked, assuming you can work out the rest with firmware. If you ever do? Awesome, it becomes a selling point. If you don't, the customer doesn't care, and the devices operates exactly as sold.
For example - the PS4 has HDMI ports that were reportedly HDMI 1.4, but they actually had a hybrid implementation of 1.4 and 2.x, allowing for HDR video to be played. This allowed sony, with the reveal of the PS4 Pro, to say "oh, by the way, all PS4s are getting HDR, just enable it in the settings".

It depends how wedged in it is.
How enamoured are you with your warranty?
In most cases, if it is dust/pocket lint/any other minor items compressed air is a great place to start. 
If that doesn't work, google "spudger" and buy one. They're a little piece of plastic made for prying open electronics without scuffing them up too badly. You may also need some torx screwdrivers depending on the phone model.
What you are looking for is the small black box encasing the headphone jack. About 90% of the time, the "rear" of it, the side opposite of where you actually plug in your headphones, is open. If something is wedged in there, you can usually stick in a paper clip and knock it loose. This is especially useful when someone's kids decide to break off a pencil tip or do something else silly.
If it is closed, you are working blind and can do a few things based on how much you care about the device. You can cut off a corner using a dremel and treat it as if it was open. You can also check an see if there are any obvious breaks/burn marks on the circuit board.

I'm glad to see you're not so much of a shill anymore. My memory of you from hashtalk was you berating every single person who dared to ask a question.
They'd point out that something didn't make sense, or that the $20 floor wasn't being honored, and then you'd chime in that "this has been discussed a thousand times" and then start slinging insults like a petulant child. Then Garza made you into a mod because you were so good at shilling for GAW. Hell, I remember you insulting me because I advocated people hedging their bets in case of XPY failing. I said there was no good reason to trust GAW, you said I didn't know what I was talking about (though in a way more juvenile way). Good thing I didn't take your advice - who knows about the other people who read your posts while you were trying to make me appear stupid. Guess I was right, huh? 
Or how about that time I posted that it was concerning how quick the mods were to ban or shadow ban anyone who asked difficult questions, and how it was giving the forum a bad image as an echo chamber? You swooped in to tell me off because "I didn't know what I was talking about," along with other juvenile insulting tirades. Man, I guess I was right again.
I wonder, when Garza made you a mod on HT, how many people did you censor? How many people who were telling the truth did you ban? How many more did you berate for asking good, valid, uncomfortable questions? How many lives do you think you helped destroy because you helped usher Garza's charade along? Do you sleep well at night knowing how much you supported his scams and some people could literally be homeless because of you? Does that bother you at all?

I'm sorry, but as someone who designs large scalable systems, that's exactly how and why you perform a stress test. You provide a ramp up period, you run at that plateau for a significant amount of time, and then you taper back to normal load. Then you take all of your readings and telemetry from that plateaued period to see how everything is functioning during that time.
You can never have a perfect real-world simulation, so you get as close as you can to have data to work off of. You seem to be arguing for doing absolutely nothing, when in fact we can be doing research to get hard evidence to guide our decision making into the future.
I for one don't like the idea of working without evidence.
@_date: 2015-09-11 12:44:33
I don't recall saying it was untested outside of production.
In many cases it's impossible to fully recreate production load in a QA environment. For instance, in our case licensing for a SIP load generator would be over 1b dollars alone to match our production traffic. The licensing and capacity for packet capturing that much data in a full test environment could double that.  It's simply impossible to fully match prod sometimes.
So you validate with a reasonable amount of load in QA, and then perform the prod buildout. The only way to verify that your production buildout works as expected is to actually test it under prod load.
Would you use a tape drive and never verify your restores worked? In mission critical systems you ALWAYS validate in prod, including stress testing.

I wonder if this has anything to do with the SEC investigation.

How much power draw does the 21 have? Could I power it with a cheap solar panel?

And we'd effectively be where we were in the early 60's where there were hundreds of different network standards with nothing to tie each of the networks together. Running an internet is significantly different from running a local network.

So, if you live in a country where annoying 3-letter agencies want you to keep track of every single bitcoin spend, will you send me and the 3-letter agency paperwork of the sale of bitcoin? Or is this a don't ask don't tell kinda thing?

Strangely, sadly, applicable :)

Also, check if they have a DRIP (dividend reinvestment program). Many companies do, and the often have incentives for dealing directly with them (such as discounts on market price).

You know, now I want to start infecting USB drives with rootkits and shipping them back and forth internationally to see if any blips show up.

Possible, but so long as you have the first part on camera, you own the police department in a civil suit.

"Are you carrying any cash on you?"
"Am I being detained?"
"Answer the question sir."
"No thanks, am I being detained? If so, what is your probable cause?"
"Sir please answer the question."
"Nah, no thanks. Am I being detained? Otherwise I'd either like to move on with my day, or else I'd like to speak with your shift supervisor."
"Sir, you can talk to me."
"That's ok, I'm invoking my right to remain silent for any further questions."
Just remember to practice these words: "Officer, am I being detained?" They have significant legal power and can mean the difference between you going to jail, and you suing the PD for a massive settlement for constitutional violations. Stay polite, as best you can anyway.

Wasn't the old definition of mainstream being able to go to your local grocery store and buy your staple goods with bitcoin? Like, buying eggs with bitcoin?

Yeah, the ACLU has an application which streams directly from your device to ACLU servers (I BELIEVE offshore).

Nope, looking for a private repo that can be accessed over the internet :)

FYI, if you only buy and never sell via them, they can never provide a full transaction record. The act of selling is where cost basis becomes important, because that's how you calculate the profit on the sale (which is what the government is interested in).
So if you buy on coinbase, but sell via some other P2P or non-domestic service, you *should* be fine.

IANAL, but I did study and work with a law firm for several years while studying with a focus on constitutional law. So, this is based on that as well as direct advice from the ACLU. Reasonable suspicion is the burden of evidence for performing a terry stop (the specific term is "investigative detention"), NOT for detaining someone. Detaining = arrest. An arrest can not be made on reasonable suspicion. However reasonable suspicion can be used to establish probable cause to make an arrest.
This is for US law btw, I can't speak for anywhere else. Possibly we're looking at different systems? There are also some other muddying factors (certain states enable security personnel and shop owners to detain a suspect).
Edit: Some sources

To be fair, there are people who likely have been holding since the last bubble collapsed. On the way up, when we meet/beat their cost basis, they may wish to liquidate their holdings and get out. It wouldn't surprise me if we see that pockmarking any new bubble or sudden climb.

I think this exactly what I saw before - I thought it was just for amazon but I remembered incorrectly. Thank you!!!!

Seriously though, I think it's pretty awesome that they do this. One day I'll have enough bitcoin to buy a freeze dryer!
@_date: 2015-02-26 21:11:44
So I could still select a custodian bank, and then purchase the bullion with bitcoin? 
...And if I was an unscrupulous person who didn't want to report my bitcoin earnings to the IRS, I could just make sure the cash transactions going into the gold company total less than 10k at a time so they aren't reportable? And then still claim the tax writeoff for a self-funded IRA at the end of the year?

Every time a sale takes place, there is also a buyer.

I would love this idea, but the issue is that github only allows free accounts if you want your code to be public. I do not, which requires a modest monthly fee :(
I haven't looked at bitbucket though. I'll take a look!

Because ISIS is already a common word in our culture between the Goddess and the TV show Archer. ISIL is both harder to pronounce and not as immediately recognizable.

How does the IRA work? Can I spend my cryptos on coins and then list the amount spent in USD on my taxes for the IRA tax credit?
@_date: 2015-02-13 22:44:28
Thats BS logic on Google' s part. You are legally able to accept donations if you aren't a tax exempt non-profit  so long as you make it clear that it is not a tax deductible donation.
I went through this with an attorney and a non profit (but not tax exempt) corporation I helped start. It was a huge deal because folks were trying to essentially throw out thousands of dollars in literature because it used the word donation. No fun.
Stupid that they're not letting companies do what they're legally entitled to do.

Curious about this - are you actually partnered with Nubile and femjoy? How willing were they to work with you?
I've toyed with the idea of going into the industry but I never know how to get started with these things.
