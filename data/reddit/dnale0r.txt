It's trivial for the current bitcoin tracking/mapping companies to also include the LTC chain in their analysis. I even suspect a lot of them are already doing it.

How will the sidechain be secured? Merge mining?
Will big miners/mining pools voluntarily run a CTsidechain-node in an environment where the war on cash becomes more harsh every year and stricter KYC/AML laws are applied? 
@_date: 2015-12-24 16:10:37
Well... an identity based mining system isn't censorship resistant because you can clearly see who approves blocks with "blacklisted coins" in them. The people who dare to approve such blocks will be prosecuted by TPTB. 
Imho this can only work if the blockchain isn't transparent.

Short answer: no.
Long answer: theoretiscally you can rewrite the whole BTC codebase and implement anything, including Monero-like ring signatures, stealth addresses and RingCT (as described in the paper we are discussing here)

It helps with privacy, not with fungibility:
BTC mainchain-&gt; CT sidechain: 


CT sidechain -&gt; BTC mainchain: 


So just keep your BTC in the sidechain?
How will this sidechain be secured? merge mined transaction fees?
Will big mining farms or pools run a CT-sidechain node in an environment where the war on cash tries to ban all anonymous payments? AML can be applied to the centralized mining industry...
My conclusion: **BTC can't become fungible, ever.**

Great! Will improve bitcoin and make systems like Namecoin, DASH, Litecoin, Bitshares, etc obsolete when this is adopted
Although this doesn't solve the fungibility issue of Bitcoin at all... Everybody can easily detect that transactions are coming from a sidechain which obfuscates transactions. If/when regulation comes to bitcoin in the way I posted here 2 weeks ago (see  we will see miners and/or payment processors blocking these "anonymous" coins. 
@_date: 2015-12-20 16:14:29
fungibility much?
@_date: 2018-05-24 09:16:02
actually, they also had some form of cash; for small transactions they exchanged small rai stones. Pretty sure the local prostitute or drug dealer didn't accept the big visible stones but preferred a bag of small ones ;)
@_date: 2015-05-25 12:36:01
That would increase the linkability between transactions and lower the privacy if you don't use coinjoin and just use your own coins. 
Also, using coinjoin could lead to mixing with "illegal coins" and tainting your identified coins leading to LE knocking on your door.
I expect most people don't want to mix with "illegal coins" for this reason...
@_date: 2015-05-25 12:38:14
why would somebody who is legitimate (i.e. bought his coins on coinbase for example) mix their coins with potentially illegal coins? That's a huge risk... 
@_date: 2015-05-24 22:32:59
I repeat: The issue we are talking about here isn't anonymity, it's fungibility.
The mixed coins will be flagged as "mixed" and future regulation may apply (black and/or white listing)
@_date: 2015-05-24 22:51:30
I hope you are right, but the blockchain is a permanent record. We already see companies (chainalysis f.e.) analyzing the blockchain. And this is still early days... Imagine which tools will be available in 5 years. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 12:25:18
What if the regulation applied for example directly to bitpay? And bitpay can only accept coins that are validated through a "certified online wallet" ? 
@_date: 2015-05-25 00:12:19




again, the Blockchain is a permanent transparent record. I think it won't be that unlikely that in 5 year's time, advanced anaylis tools will be availible and a lot of "perceived anonimity" will be broken. But again, it's not even about anonimity, it's about fungibility. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 00:38:47


We already have the NSA, did you notice?
They don't need to convince the public, they will just analyse the public and transparent bitcoin blockchain
@_date: 2015-05-24 22:49:28
1) it's about the fact that building illegal transactions on the blockchain means your block reward will be orphaned because the other complying pools don't build on your block.
2+3) pools generally decide which transactions to include in the block. Only a few have the option to do that as an individual miner
@_date: 2015-05-24 23:02:35
yes, your wallet will have the option to ignore the blacklisted UTXO's
@_date: 2015-05-25 01:06:26


@_date: 2016-01-08 20:04:28
privacy doesn't solve fungibility.
By the way, coinjoining your coins would make them "darker". I can't imagine people who earned "white" bitcoins to voluntarily mix them through coinjoin.
@_date: 2015-05-24 23:09:09
yes, a miner (most of the time the pool operator) can choose on which block they will build
@_date: 2015-05-25 00:00:10
again, it's not about privacy, it's about fungibility
@_date: 2016-01-08 20:00:10
it's possible to enforce some transaction rules on the blockchain if users want to avoid identification obligations when spening BTC at regulated payment processors. 
It could become "mandatory" to for example only create transactions that have a maximum of 2 outputs (payment and change) coming from 1 input OR a maximum of 1 output coming from different inputs (a "consolidation transaction").
This would make bitcoins that use coinjoin blacklisted. To be able to spend them at payment processors or exchanges, you would need to fully identify yourself.
@_date: 2015-05-25 00:20:38
HD wallets or even darkwallet don't solve the problem of fungibility...
@_date: 2015-05-25 01:02:34




They are linked, but you it's not the same. The tools that need to be developed to start regulating bitcoin doesn't need to do identify everyone (that's a lot of work and probably impossible to do). They only need to flag certain UTXO's as "suspicious". And that's a lot easier to do. Just figure out where the mixers are located on the blockchain for example. Or flag coinjoin-transactions by default.
@_date: 2016-01-08 22:34:35
My point is that those mixing services would need to pay a premium for obtaining white bitcoins, which actually means that "dirty" bitcoins are worth less. this clearly means that fungibility is broken.
Try explaining a new arrival to BTC that he needs to do such and such to be private on the network, that he need to worry about this and that, otherwise his coins will be worth less. Serioulsy, who wants to use this kind of 'currency' ?
@_date: 2016-01-08 17:56:59
As long as this isn't implemented at protocol level, used by default and is enforced for every transaction, this won't improve fungibility. 
Also, you need HD wallets or stealth addresses used by default + confidential transactions by default.
@_date: 2016-01-08 15:27:03
the fact that blockchain analysis is possible, is indeed the issue. If such an analysis wasn't possible, it would be the same as accepting cash payments. You don't need to check where the cash comes from. Hence, bitcoin isn't "internet cash".
@_date: 2016-01-09 02:30:28
I'm HODLing 5 USB Block Erupters. Won't sell them below 100 USD per piece :D
@_date: 2016-01-08 15:24:03
I suggest reaching out to BitPay for more details. 
As I said in my original post on r/monero that is linked here on r/bitcoin, I would prefer to see the video again to double check what Roelants actually said. Unfortunately, the video isn't released yet.
@_date: 2016-01-08 22:29:16


Maybe this kind of businesses can get an exception/license? Anything is possible once government tries to regulate BTC.
edit: I'm not saying it would be illegal to send multiple input + multiple output transactions. I'm only sayig it's possible your coins will be blacklisted when you do. To make them "spendable" again in the regular economy (through payment processors or exchanges) you maybe would need to identify yourself first.
@_date: 2015-05-25 12:05:35
it's pretty easy to discover mixers with data mining. LE can just try to mix coins a few times and analyse the transaction clusters that appear.
Coinjoin needs servers to function and again, you can try to cluster addresses that use this system.
PS: DASH is basically bitcoin with coinjoin servers (masternodes). Not very secure imho. Also, running a coinjoin server could become a crime (money laundering)
@_date: 2016-01-08 15:36:57
fungibility can only be added if it's enforced across the network, i.e. should be integrated at protocol level so everyone uses mixing by default.
I don't see this happening with bitcoin. The protocol is ossifying.
@_date: 2016-01-09 02:10:51
I'm not trying to pump anything. If you call what I do "pumping", you are "pumping" BTC.
Some coins have consensus rules that prevent these kind of regulation. So this will result either in fungible legal transactions or in fungible illegal transactions. Legal or not, the transactions themselves will be fungible.
@_date: 2017-03-27 11:41:43
how to have a decentralized way to determine the sequence? What prevents validators to cooperate? How to pick validators at random?
@_date: 2016-06-01 16:10:05
asuming an exponential growth of the UTXO set in bitcoin and and exponential growth of generating new TXO's in XMR, it's basically the difference between 
* BTC: e^(x)
* XMR: integral[t0,t1](e^(x) dx) where t0 = genesis and t1 = now
     which equals e^(t1)
So yes, a full node needs to store more, but both functions are exponential. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 19:09:15
ChainAnchor for example. It's not against Nakamoto Consensus.
Basically censorship by miners. Perfectly possible on BTC.
@_date: 2016-06-01 14:58:40


that IS indeed the crucial difference between BTC and XMR. And it has very important consequences regarding fungibility...
@_date: 2016-06-01 18:44:35
I agree Monero isn't 100% fungible and imho it's not even possible because people can themselves always chose to make themselves known. 
But... and this is the main reason I support Monero, when transacting, you generate positive externalities: you obfuscate the chain more! This is completely the opposite in BTC where by transacting, analysis can eventually lead to less fungibility for others. 
So, by merely using Monero, the fungibility will improve in the long run, while when somebody uses BTC, the fungibility will decrease slowly over time. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 09:52:51


If it's not "on by default", it won't ensure fungibility...
@_date: 2015-08-25 17:32:58
OLD NEWS, was already leaked in 2013:
@_date: 2015-07-23 12:23:30
When will you guys learn that anonimity isn't the real problem, it's fungibility. Coinjoin (or other implementations) doesn't solve that.
Will you voluntarily mix your coins with pedophiles, terrorists and drug "criminals" when you know that dozens of companies are watching, monitoring and analyzing the public bitcoin blockchain and selling this information to banks, exchanges, wallet services and governments? 
Open your eyes guys!
@_date: 2015-07-24 00:32:21
agreed, but in that context, do you prefer using Bitcoin or Monero?
Imho, using BTC while "not playing by the rules" (i.e. stealth addresses, mixing, no identification, etc) is a bigger risk than using Monero. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 12:57:11
...until exchanges and payment processors start to taint coins using blockchainanalysis provided by numerous companies (chainalysis.com, coinalytics.co, ...)
Then people won't use the coinjoin function in the mycelium wallet (which will probably not be mandatory, but optional)
@_date: 2015-07-23 14:40:33
even if coinjoin works perfectly, people will make mistakes and fungibility will be broken. it will always be a risk accepting BTC from an unknown source.
even if blacklisting is not possible, there is a thing called "whitelisting":
It is very possible that governments will implement something like this: people would be required to identify themselves before they will be able to spend coins at regulated payment processors or sell them at exchanges. If people don't do this, they have "grey bitcoins" which could become a crime at some point in time.
The fact that all transactions are public makes it a lot more difficult, making mistakes is a lot easier and you are storing a permanent record, making it vulnerable to future analyse techniques 
@_date: 2016-02-12 22:01:28
That is exactly the point:
You can still blacklist UTXO's. The only thing you can't know is how much is blacklisted.
On top of that,  if CT isn't default, all Confidential Transactions will be suspicious. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 15:25:47
what about a dynamic block size limit? oh wait... real scaling solutions is not something we should hope for in BTC. 
@_date: 2016-02-20 12:45:36
this isn't a coincidence, it's a marketing strategy decided by the miners...
@_date: 2016-02-20 12:44:27
it's a shame BTC needs a political committee (in China LOL) that decides the future.
@_date: 2016-02-19 12:22:42


Only if it's default and enforced at protocol level, and has also stealth addresses embedded at protocol level.


you know that there is already a coin that has stealth addresses at protocol level and handles untraceability with ring signatures (and will soon be improved with Ring Confidential Transactions)? Just google "Monero". No need for a corporate coin like Zerocash. 
@_date: 2016-02-12 20:36:53
Confidential Transactions don't really improve fungibility. 
You can still track money flows: for example your payment to a darkmarket is still visible. You can't tell how much you've send, but it's still possible to follow the money. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 23:53:28
This wallet doesn't increase fungibility, it merely makes more people liable:
When you participate in a coinjoin, you actually touch the tainted coins and use them in your transaction. If you compare this with ring sigantures, you can always provide a full trace of your coins when law enforcement knocks on your door because you used a tainted txo as a decoy. But you don't actually touch the tainted coins. It's a subtle, but important difference.
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:02:24
less and less people want to mix. Why would you want to incriminate yourself? When you withdraw from an exchange, why pay extra fees to mix with criminals??
@_date: 2018-03-23 21:02:59
except that BTC won't ever be private BY DEFAULT. And that's the point to achieve fungibility. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 19:37:22


LOL. that would potentially get people using wasabi in a sticky situation.
There are 2 kinds of "taint". The "forward taint" is the only one that people talk about. But there is a "reverse taint" as well: if you are tangled into a transaction that sent coins to a tainted address, you might get in trouble. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 19:49:09
yes, Monero.
@_date: 2018-03-24 01:12:52
You clearly don't know how BTC works... that HF will never be adopted. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:26:03
... or why BTC can't be used as real currency.

It was a planned instamine. And it wasn't mentioned before launch, so in my books, that's a scam. Please don't ignore the facts:
**2013-12-29**: 


**2014-01-18**: 


**2014-01-19**: 


This was the emission of the first 100 days:


Note that in the first hour, 500k Xcoins were mined. Due to the "quick fix" of the bug, not many people expected to launch a few hours after Evan said he would "definitely not" launch in the next hours.
**2014-01-19**: 


**2014-01-20**: 


**2014-01-22**: 




Later on, some contradictions surfaced:
* The emission schedule changed multiple times. The latest we heard is that the number of coins would be somewhere between 14 million and like 16 million DASH. (
* Evan said that this project was just a hobby he started while working on a full time job and coded Xcoin in a weekend. (
* Evan claims there were hundreds of miners if not thousands when Xcoin launched. (
Recent investigation showed that there were 124 IP addreses that were mining at the start. 115 of those addresses where Cloudhosting and Dedicated Servers, 9 of them seem to be private/users.106 of them were at Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure cloud instances. (
* Evan isn't acting alone, he had/has a team behind him right from the start. It wasn't a hobby. he had a plan to make a profit.
* Evan had plans for his coin right from the start, but didn't release them until after the instamine
* 1.5 million coins were mined in the first 8 hours. Most of these coin ended up in his (and his friends) hands. It's very likely the 500k in the first hour were only mined by him with cloudhosting services.
* He lowered the emission later on, to make his relative share of coins bigger.
How can this be all an accident (like Evan is always saying) and NOT be intentional?
Evan was looking for c++ devs for a "for profit startup" at the end of 2013 for the launch of an altcoin.


**Answer**: 


How he did it is pretty easy:
* telling people the release would definitely not be in the next couple of hours and after that do launch it a few hours later
* buggy windows binaries
* a "code error" creating 500k coins in the first hour, &gt;1.5 million in the first 8 hours.
**=&gt; DASH was clearly a planned premine/instamine.**
@_date: 2015-11-15 16:31:52
This doesn't solve fungibility issues. Blacklisting is still possible.
@_date: 2015-11-15 19:22:48
unless... regulated payment providers and exchanges also are forced to use the blacklisting chain. 
@_date: 2015-11-06 16:35:42
DASH isn't really anonymous ad you need to mix on centralized masternodes. Also, it's very slow. i tried mixing 2 DASH... it took 3 hours to get the job done. Monero is decentralized instant mixing by default.
@_date: 2015-11-16 10:14:03

* BTC-e blacklisting: 
* Coinbase, guilt by association: 
* Coinbase monitoring inputs and outputs: 
@_date: 2015-09-27 23:34:15
i've read it and I don't see where he is adressing the fungibility issue at all. He also doesn't really seem concerned about government spying. As long as the bartender can't see what his income is, all is well...
@_date: 2015-11-16 01:15:36
if you want fungibility, it's needed in the base layer across the network. Otherwise you don't really have it.
@_date: 2015-11-16 01:15:55
@_date: 2015-11-19 12:50:50
no, I expect "tighten" as in "blacklisting"
@_date: 2015-11-15 11:03:50
sidechains have one big problem: you can see when you move in our out of the sidechain. So identities can be attached to this "suspicious activity".
Buying Monero with cash is a much better option.
@_date: 2015-11-15 15:39:36
Now we are going in the technical details. But sidechains are proposed to be merged mined. I think miners won't just spontaneously merge mine sidechains without a reward, and certainly no regulatory risky sidechains.
Besides that, tell me where I can currently buy that SidechainPrivateCoin?
yeah... Doesn't exist. So private and fungible transactions aren't currently possible with BTC. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 18:21:09
I mean... People can choose to not include the tainted spam transactions in the transactions they spend, to avoid legal problems.
If this becomes a real issue, I expect some wallets to give you the option to ignore tainted spam inputs
@_date: 2015-11-09 22:10:28
lol, why? 
@_date: 2015-11-15 15:48:10
DASH privacy relies on masternodes. They can deanonymize your transactions. Better use Monero.
@_date: 2015-11-22 14:36:14
Apart from the nontransparent emission, an additional problem with zerocash is that it has a very big anonymity set... Too big to be practical, resulting in "zerobloat", a bloated blockchain and probably very slow transactions. Also the crypto isn't really tested yet.
Monero balances the issue by giving the sender the choice on how big his anonymity set will be. He can choose how big the ring signature is by choosing the number of txo's to mix with. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 01:45:19
seems like signing up for a new bank account lol
@_date: 2015-11-22 15:00:05
Bitcoin isn't eCash because not anonymous/fungible
@_date: 2015-11-15 13:03:30
and what do you think the average user will click when presented the choice? He wants to mix with "clean" coin of course...
@_date: 2015-11-15 12:53:37
1) A lot of companies are doing a form of self-censorship already (bitpay, coinbase, BTC-e, ...). So I can see chinese miners complying just because they want to avoid problems
2) Miners will at some point start demanding their pools to comply. If pools ignore these requests, miners will switch to a pool that actually complies.
3) When enough miners comply, the "illigal block depth" can be increased, leading to small miners or pools who originally weren't complying to be compliant. if they don't comply, they risk loosing a block reward because they built a block on a block with an illigal transaction.
@_date: 2015-11-15 10:41:25
Doesn't work for fungibility as you can potentially mix with blacklisted coins.
It works a bit for privacy, although the transactions can be deanonymize by the other party.
@_date: 2015-11-16 01:14:42
Simple question: who will merge mine the sidechains without incentive?
@_date: 2015-11-15 16:39:28
It's not about anonymity were are talking, it's about fungibility.
Blacklisting can go beyond one "hop" easily.
Read this:
@_date: 2015-11-16 01:46:37
what are the drawbacks according to you?
@_date: 2015-11-15 11:55:57
We have fees, as an anti spam measure.
It can still be used as store of value, but you need to know that there is a yearly inflation of less than 1%. If the number of lost coins is also 1%, there is no real inflation.
And if you are concerned about the small inflation, store your whealth in BTC and transact in XMR when you need to.
@_date: 2015-11-09 12:44:27
DASH is a scam:
@_date: 2015-11-16 01:37:32
Without incentive, why would miners merge mine the sidechain? Tell me.
@_date: 2015-10-02 20:07:34
thx :)
@_date: 2015-11-15 11:06:06
It's a 0.3 XMR inflation per minute, not 1% forever, so the inflation percent will go down over time.
We want to secure our blockchain with this small inflation.
@_date: 2015-11-15 11:07:42
Also DASH mixes coins in "masternodes". You depend on a counterparty for your "anonymous mixing". Not really good technology. Monero has way better anonimity.
@_date: 2015-10-22 15:28:21
It will help blockchain analysis companies and governments to track money flows and users. That's the reason behind this "alliance".
Seriously, we don't want this.

As owner of those top addresses, you can select the inputs you want to not taint your outputs with the blacklisted coins.
Bitcoin is based on input/output, not on address
@_date: 2015-10-02 18:16:03
that question  23 was me :D
@_date: 2015-11-15 15:51:14
Yes, you are right. But Monero also uses stealth addresses by default, making it harder to link outputs. 
In my opinion, ring signatures are the best compromise between size of the transaction and anonimity. ZK transactions are huge and will take a lot of time to generate. Ring signatures are almost generated instantly.
@_date: 2015-10-22 15:26:50
RIP fungibility.
If all major exchanges, bitpay, etc will share information, I guarantee you that eventually some form of blacklisting/whitelisting will be enforced.
These shenanigans were certainly NOT the reason why I joined bitcoin a few years ago. Quite the opposite...
@_date: 2015-11-15 10:54:09
You've noticed that Bitfury is in this Blockchain Alliance?
I think big mining farms and pools will eventually be subject to AML laws.
They will after a while (when the hashrate complying with the rules and regulations is big enough) not be allowed to build a block on a block containing illegal transactions.

ever heard of guilt by association?
Governments will discourage mixing by keep blacklisting the outputs, even if there are several "hops" between the mixing and the spending.
If you spend the coins at bitpay for example, bitpay can be required by government to send the to a government wallet. Your coins are now confiscated under Civil Asset Forfeiture law.
With a bit of luck you get a percentage back if you can prove you did nothing wrong, worst case you loose your coins.

about inflation: I rather have predictable inflation (that goes down over time!) than an unpredictable central bank.

Yes, I am also the one who asked that single question to jihan (something that wasn't really allowed to happen at first). People in the audience asked to state my name. I did and mentioned my website as well.

I don't think this post would increase the chances of the regulation I describe at all. Governments aren't stupid.

JoinMarket functions pretty good, I think. Didn't use it yet. 
The DASH CoinJoin requires trust in the masternodes though, which are basically semi-centralized servers that can easily be Sybil attacked and/or spied upon by the governments.

Most masternodes are hosted on cloud hosting servers, which is trivial for TLA's to get a backdoor in, or a search warrant or...
Centralized hosting: 
A way better system is mixing using ring signatures. You don't depend on the opsec of others to mix securely. It's fully decentralized and it can be used by default in every transactions. CoinJoin by default would be a nightmare for the masternodes.

Just FYI: The DASH "protocol mixing" is nothing more than an optional CoinJoin mixer built in the GUI. Nothing fancy. BTC has more liquidity in the regular mixers, CoinJoin mixers and Joinmarket than DASH, so BTC is more private than DASH. (what's more: DASH needs to pay 5 liquidity providers for the mixers to be somewhat functional)
