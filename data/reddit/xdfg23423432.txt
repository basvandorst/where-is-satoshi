you can buy SLL (second life lindens) on  using paypal and then trade them for BTC.. other than that if you know someone who has a BTC exchange account and trusts you not to fuck them over with a paypal chargeback, maybe you can persuade them to buy some for you and pay them back with paypal.. 
other than that you can probably find some other foolish people that might do it especially for altcoins like which can then be converted to BTC.

It's actually quite unlikely that someone will connect to you from the same IP using the same port more than once as the ephemeral ports are chosen randomly at the time of the connection.. so really your question boils down too 
"why is this client connecting to me more than other clients" 
The answer probably lies on that website "Bitnodes is currently being developed to estimate the size of the Bitcoin network by finding all the reachable nodes in the network. " - I guess it could be a cover for something nefarious, but probably it's just doing what it says - discovering and testing connectivity to lots of bitcoin nodes.

Perhaps you could elaborate on what you're seeing (actual log entry would be great)? Different IPs with the rev. dns pointing back to that name? or did it just connect to you a few times using different ephemeral ports?

fantastic.. when deciding whether or not to buy a car I find it often comes down to the ease of having someone place a bow on the roof.

ah.. actually "getaddr.bitnodes.io:0.1" is the client version string.. so I guess it's someone's custom client.. probably gathering data for the website at
