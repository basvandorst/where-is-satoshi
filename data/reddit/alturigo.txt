Interest rates on loans are also low, so money is cheap. This means people are more likely to take STUPID risks and start SHITTY businesses. If interest rates were high, THEY would have to bother THINKING WHETHER risking hundreds of thousands of dollars opening a RANDOM restaurant IS WORTH IT when I could get risk free returns from a bank? 
TL;DR cheap money is at the core of most financial crisis because it makes abundant something that shouldn't be.

The fact that we now have low interest rates is simply a matter of manipulation from central banks. The problem is that they only think on the positive effects of this policy and they ignore the long term and not so obvious consequences.
I think the biggest advantage of cryptocurrencies is that for the first time, we have money with clear rules agreed by all the participants on that economy.

In inflationary systems like the ones managed by the ECB or the Fed, the newly created money goes straight to the rich so they only ones forces to spend is the middle class.
In deflationary systems it makes sense to spend because you can’t eat your bitcoins and you can’t live inside your dollars.
Bitcoin supply system is superior not because it is deflationary but because nobody is over it. Same rules for everybody.

I think they realized that one thing is to get it working and another thing is to make it in an affordable way. The cost of running advanced smart contracts in the bitcoin network would be too high to allow any significant demand of them. Better keep a low profile until they come up with something.

Thanks for sharing. Great video.

They are not allowing you, they are enabling you to find another person that wants to exchange fiat/btc.

This kind of advice is needed specially now and specially for the new passengers of the rocket to the moon.
Those of us who has been here for a while understand the technical and political risks of Bitcoin but those going all in just because now everything looks like rainbows and lollipops should really not invest more than they are willing to lose.

AFAIK this is only present in processors with vPro, it is usually not supported by consumer models. Can anybody confirm?

You expect the whitepaper to list all the possible applications of bitcoin (money)?

Not in reddit. Here everybody is a believer AKA hodlers.

Happy for Bitrefill, I am a very happy user of their service. I know tho that I will hate them when their business becomes mainstream successful, gets to monopoly level and creates lightning farms where biggest payment hubs can be ruled solely by them.
Anything is possible guys.

You can call us believers and we are are the ones keeping Bitcoin alive.

That wouldn't change anything in this case because Spain has the private keys for those funds.

If that happens, it would be temporary until the difficulty adjusts and the overall effect pretty minimal.

Agree. Bits are my favorite one and Satoshis would be like cents. Quite intuitive.
The problem I see with denominations with lots of decimals is that they have no punctuation. I find it very helpful to read long numbers:
30,000.00 bits is easier to read for me than 0.03000000 btc.

I agree with him on the second part: Bitcoin is not here to produce value, it is here to transfer and store it.

They are pooling off-chain! But what about the miners? Nobody is going to think about them?
@_date: 2018-04-26 21:35:36
Just adding decimals would require a hard fork?

How are full blocks going to kill bitcoin exactly?
And home nodes DO matter in decentralization. Me being able to validate transactions without any third party is precisely one of the pillars of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-04 14:20:51
The point is convenience. Adoption beyond tech people will need to put some trust on third parties. This solution is much better than keeping your coins in an exchange and it is very easy to detect if Casas are being delivered with invalid chains.
@_date: 2017-06-18 12:50:19
And what's wrong with people using Litecoin or any other alt to do as many transactions as they want? I would do it myself if I ever want to buy a coffee with a cryptocoin, but I want that the coin in which I have the real stuff is kept as decentralized, secure and immutable as possible.
Blockchains are inefficient as fuck, resources are finite and their costs can't be ignored.

I wouldn't waste energy trying to get consensus on that.
