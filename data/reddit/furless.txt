I have an issue with decimals, particularly for smaller amounts, and the reason is that 0.00001 looks an awful lot like 0.0001. Granted, if the price of a good or service is linked to a fiat currency, then software will make the appropriate conversion correctly. However, if you are asking for money in bitcoin units only, then this confusion could arise.

The correct price is the price that you both agree on. You might also make the case that buying in bulk should get you a better deal.

Doubt there'd be any "damage". More likely is that it would just bring the price of BTC down to where speculators decide to stop selling.

As someone who is currently (again!) recovering from a bitcoin-qt database corruption, it is difficult at times to get away from the impression that the bitcoin infrastructure is held together with twist ties. (Seriously, an abrupt proram termination should not result in hours, and even days, rebuilding the block chain. And it will only get worse. There ought to be daily checkpoints built in.)
Moreover, the infrastructure cannot support anywhere close to the volume of fiat monetary transactions today, so bitcoin can never be more than a "boutique" currency. This necessarily limits its value. In order to play with the big boys, bitcoin's developers need to get serious about bitcoin's ability to scale ... not to mention greater robustness for bitcoind/bitcoin-qt.
Bitcoin could make it to $10k, but the value would be based on speculation, rather than functionality, unless bitcoin's limitations are addressed.

There are all kinds of problems with the thought, but what if it were possible for the bitcoin gods to freeze further transactions with the wallet(s) involved? On the minus side, however, that implies a de facto centralized governance.

The only compelling reason I can think of for buying a mining rig is if you cannot buy your coinage (for legal reasons, for example). The problem for would-be miners is that they are not the only ones thinking of getting into the racket. As a result, the advantage over others that one might expect from a mining rig is far less than expected because of all the others with new rigs.

I was reading today some economist explaining that the reason repeated QE hasn't led to runaway inflation is because the money is not circulating as fast as expected. I suppose there's some sense to that: If there's a flood of wooden nickels, but it's all sitting in a bank vault, then no one really cares. What this suggests, however, is that when the economy starts picking up steam, and the demand for cash rises, then the wheels will come off again.
It's an interesting idea, and if it's right it ought to happen around the end of the next president's term. On the other hand, I'm no Warren Buffet, and QE may end up defying the nay-sayers and have no negative effects.

The Zimbabwean Dollar is not doing too well these days -- having effectively been [abandoned]( as a currency since 2009. It seems to me that only concentrated political will can turn a currency that was once valued at par with the US dollar into one where in 2009 1 USD could buy 300 000 000 000 000 ZWD. Even at its inception, I don't think BTC ever went that cheaply.

Krugman, alas, may have his best days behind him. As Obama's Nobel demonstrates, its award does not confer superhuman abilities, and in this case it appears that Krugman is wide of the mark. As an economist, he knows that he needs to do more than merely pronounce something to be true in order for it to pass muster, or even for it to be taken seriously, by other economists.
@_date: 2013-12-23 09:00:52
The ability of fiat money to hold value depends on the central bank and government of the day having self-discipline. Although most first world currencies are in fairly good shape, in the sense that devaluation is controlled and predictable, countries like Zimbabwe make the case for independent currencies. It can be tempting for a government to "inflate" its way out of a cash bind, even though history shows the solution to be short-lived.

I'm not a technical expert, but from what I recall every transaction is public record. This suggests that there needs to be not only massive computing power, but huge bandwidth and storage to support the continuous rush of Bitcoin transactions that would be happening.
Look at how large your Bitcoin wallet is now. Then think about how large it would have to be, and how much it would be growing every day, in such an environment.

There was a discussion about this, and the takeaway seemed to be that payback was somewhere between six and twelve months, depending on configuration, which would be pretty good, except for the risks that a) bfl execs will relocate to Panama with your money, and b) that bitcoins will become worthless by government regulation or "tulip"-type implosion.

Economists are not much better than anyone else in predicting the future. That said, I think even bitcoin advocates accept that bitcoin has its set of risks.

I haven't analyzed the argument, but I appreciate that the author is at least putting some effort into defending his position, rather than waving hands and name-calling detractors. If Bitcoin is to survive and flourish, its perceived deficiencies (real or not) need to be unflinchingly addressed.
My unconsidered response to his argument about inflation as the cost of security is to point to election spending as one of the large costs of democracy. This analogy suggest two points. First, a perfect, lossless, system might not only be unachievable, but the costs might be an essential component of the system. (Regarding democracy, Churchill famously said that it was the very worst system of government that has been tried, except for all the others.) In short, seeking to reduce the costs of Bitcoin, without deeply considering the consequences, may profoundly affect Bitcoin for the worse.   The second point suggested by the analogy, is that the costs -- "inflation" for Bitcoins, and election spending for democracy -- might also include value. For election spending, one of the values, hidden among the layers of muck, is that key issues get aired and debated. Could there also be a benefit hidden in the Bitcoin cost?

If there becomes a pattern of all banks refusing to do business with those in the Bitcoin business, I wonder whether those banks could be opening themselves up to discrimination/anti-competitive lawsuits. It seems to me that there will be quite a lot more pushback by the traditional banking and financial companies as Bitcoin continues to mature.

The thing is, I would have guessed conservatively, as others seem to be doing, a year ago, but we know now that a conservative guess would have been way, way off. It's for that reason that I'm looking at $20k, which I'm thinking will still be low.
Of course, if what others are predicting is correct, then that will mean that the price of bitcoin has stabilized -- which won't be a bad thing either. The third option, that bitcoin will crash hard, is possible, but I think it will take a major government or a Fortune 50 to make that happen.
@_date: 2013-08-30 17:51:10
The article, although overly self-serving, is not completely off-base. It seems to me, however, that one of the things he says must be achieved -- traceability -- is what many user do not, in fact, want. He seems to be saying that bitcoin must learn to play nice with governments, but if you're going to play nice, you might as well use US dollars.
That said, I think that he has a point on how easily bitcoin can be stopped in its tracks by the US government. Bitcoin would not actually go away, but if it could not be converted to "ordinary" currency a great deal of its value would disappear.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:39:21
Where's the ceiling? That's anyone's guess. For my .00002 BTC, $800 within the year sounds attainable. However, this depends on bitcoin's ability to  withstand the mauling it will get should Wallstreet decide to play with it.
For most people, it's not particularly useful/convenient for ordinary transactions, so it's more of a novelty than anything else. For me, this means using money from your "entertainment/gambling" budget.

Actually, I could see this as something that the North Korean ruling scum could do, especially when bitcoin's "fundamental" price is in the hundreds.
Currently, there are international restrictions on the flow of money (I'm frantically waving my hands around now, because I don't know the details). Not only can North Korea use bitcoins to get around some of these restrictions, but it can use mining as a way of getting more access to hard currency with relatively little effort.

Bitcoin will probably see several shocks in the coming years, but I don't think the deflation argument is very strong. Unlike dollars, bitcoins can be broken up into much tinier pieces, so that issue won't be problematic for quite some time, if at all.
The problem I see with bitcoin is that in the near to medium term it will continue to be a speculative currency, with sometimes dramatic swings. Most businesses (and people) want a currency whose value today will buy pretty much the same things tomorrow.

It's an interesting post. I would suggest however, that, more than not investing more than you can afford to lose, is not to buy any bitcoins with dollars that you foresee having to use. For example, if someone uses next month's rent money to buy bitcoins, then that person must, in a couple weeks, buy back dollars. Based on historical records, however, it can take months for the value of bitcoin to climb back to the previous high -- all the while assuming bitcoin survives.
@_date: 2013-12-29 17:16:39
If a government really wanted to take down Bitcoin, there are other ways that would be more effective, I think. For example, making possession punishable by a lengthy jail term (or death) would probably be enough to end trade in that country. Also, a reasonably wealthy nation could throw a couple hundred million dollars into mining gear and software to subvert production.
It seems to me that the more value and reach that Bitcoin attains, the more likely that one of these scenarios becomes. The only way that Bitcoin will survive is for major governments to accept, and perhaps even adopt to some degree, the currency. Going out of one's way to antagonize governments is not, in my view, a viable long term survival strategy.
@_date: 2013-05-12 11:43:15
As bitcoin currently exists, zero. There simply isn't the capacity to support millions of transactions per second.

"Invest" is probably not the correct word, since that implies a certain confidence of a positive ROI. But there's nothing wrong with spending $50 to get on the train and see what's going on.
If the long term trend holds, your $50 may be worth double or quadruple in a year, but a key part of Bitcoin's value is in people actually using it. It should also be noted that if a major government decides that Bitcoin is Bad, then it could probably takes steps that would seriously knock back Bitcoin's value.
@_date: 2013-04-28 08:57:40
I don't think it will make any difference.
If the number of new bitcoins that are created is at a steady rate, then the variable is that the difficulty of *mining* required will increase to account for the speedier ASICs. The only thing that will change is that the current mining equipment will get a much smaller slice of the new bitcoin "pie". For the non-miners, however, things should be pretty much the same as usual.
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:08:18
Agreed. If there is a limit on the volume of bitcoin transactions, then we need to find ways of lifting that limit. Transaction fees, it seems to me, help prioritize transactions, which will help a bit, but there will still remain a practical limit.
I wonder if it would be possible to "split up" the bitcoin network, so transactions from different segments could be handled simultaneously, with some clearinghouse used when bitcoins get moved from one block to another.
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:25:49
Call me crazy, but I don't think it will drop (for long, anyway) as low as $200. I'm thinking the new floor will be around $800. But it doesn't particularly matter. What I'm confused about is where the next high is going to be.
The other day, I visited a bitcoin ATM, and I saw people spend $2,000 and $4,000 (in cash) buying bitcoins. That's speculation money, not curiousity money, so presumably these people are betting on another price increase. I suppose if one looks at it mathematically, dividing 21 million btc among 100 million people means that 1 btc could theoretically climb to tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. But, speaking for myself, the day I see it hit $20k is the day I take my wheelbarrow to the ATM. Others with bitcoins must have similar plans. This has got to put an upper bound on the bitcoin, surely.

Yes, the conversion between Bitcoin and real money needs to be dirt simple for larger adoption by the non-geek community.

It should be possible to write an arbitration app that would consider fees, waiting time, and market risk, then execute trades automatically. In fact, I would venture that such a thing is inevitable if bitcoin can sustain a value &gt; $100. If it hasn't been done already, it's only because of the knowledge how susceptible bitcoin's value is to manipulation.

I think that market manipulation is very plausible. If it wasn't intentional this time, it soon will be.
Bitcoin reminds me of the Internet in the early days, where "gee whiz!" hid the fact that there are always people willing to do mischief/evil. Bitcoin might not be able to withstand the Wallstreet scum who perpetrated their sub-prime mortgage hack, but it ought to be hardened against the garden-variety pump-and-dumpers.

My interest is mainly academic, and I don't have much "skin" in this game.
I was refunded $20 with a few bitcoins, and have since cashed out most of them at a healthy profit. If there's additional money to be made, it will largely be by others.
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:43:07
The big thing holding bitcoin back from wider adoption is that its value currently swings so much compared to other currencies.
Some of that variation will go away as adoption increases, but I think that there are also technical issues that make bitcoin susceptible to manipulation -- such as has happened recently with DDOS attacks on exchanges. Some of this can be addressed, I think, by the usual hardening of systems, but something also needs to be done to ensure that a large mining pool cannot subvert the system.
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:15:14
Hmmm. Maybe we have different ideas about the meaning of "guess", and, anyway, gambling is not my passion. As I've said, I've already got my original money back several times over, so if there's any more to be had, great, and if Bitcoin crashes, then I'll still be ahead.
Believe it or not, a major reason I still have some coinage is to spend it (and, no, not on drugs!) Without Bitcoin, I simply wouldn't have been able to do business with an EU company, for example.

It would be interesting to see whether this "guarantee" exists, or whether it is a fraud (which could be a federal offense). Whenever a guarantee is mentioned, it is assumed that the organization has the resources to "make good" on the guarantee. In fact, internally, accountants set aside assets based on historical or other conservative estimates on the costs of fulfilling the guarantee. Given the riskiness of the venture, I wonder how the investor cares to explain the basis of the "guarantee".
@_date: 2013-10-24 23:02:45
It's an interesting issue. The question is not only whether "useful" work can be done, but also whther the currency will gain sufficiently broad acceptance. It seems to me that Bitcoin's rise may have been a case of being in the right place at the right time. In addition, if a new cryptocurrency were being fashioned, I'd be surprised if "the government" (one or all of China, Russia, and the USA) would not want to get some commanding advantage.

Actually, I think you *can* "solve massive systemic and social oppression with technical solutions", if the technical solutions are big enough.
The gun, for example, has been a great leveller, and is one reason that the more oppressive a regime, the more restrictions are placed on its availability. The cell phone is another technical solution that has made some good inroads on casual police brutality.

It's too late now, but people who speculate in Bitcoin should not put money in that think they might want to spend within six months, or even a year. Although the long term trend is positive, it seems to me that every surge is followed by a period of relative stability (for Bitcoin, that is) before the next surge. My guess is that it could be as long as April before the value passes $2k -- always assuming that some catastrophe doesn't wipe out all value.

First, $10,000 could happen in as little as a year, if past behaviour is any indication. Second, assuming the price stabilizes relative to other currencies, it will be used to buy and sell things (like other currencies) rather than for speculative gain.
