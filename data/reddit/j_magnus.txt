I have been to the California Cantina and I must say, it is awesome. Met a guy who went to college in my hometown at the bar, he was Chilean, I am from the US. So we had a lot to talk about. Everyone is super friendly. It's the only bar in Santiago that was showing the NBA finals at the time. Get a pitcher of Sangria, it's the best thing on the drinks menu. A must see for anyone visiting Santiago.

You're taping feathers, a duck bill, and webbed feet to a wet dog and calling it a duck. For Bitcoin to be a pyramid scheme it must behave accordingly in every aspect of it's existence. Also your sourcing for your claims is impeccable (sarcasm). BTC actually is organically growing in value, and the comment section for this article in which you've picked a fight with out little cult is a great segway to elaborate. So let me illustrate how Bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme. Bitcoin offers utility in facilitating transactions between individuals. Because of it's increasing utility (in that more and more vendors are accepting btc) bitcoin's value is growing in terms of utility. Now this does not factor in bitcoins risk premium, volatility, etc (other things that affect price.) Bitcoin is at it’s core a currency.
In many way's bitcoin is still a very small market, with a miniscule market cap in comparison with similar markets. So while it's utility may be growing it's price may be falling. **That is perfectly fine** Bitcoin was never meant to be a means of storing wealth, and profiteering, it's adoption as a means of storing wealth and making money such is entirely speculative. Its’ monetary value may be increasing because of a speculative bubble and that is fine. But no one was calling gold a pyramid scheme when everyone and their mother started buying it; because that was speculative too. Speculation is not a pyramid scheme.
Now you say there is a pyramid scheme because all the early adopters are making money. But you misunderstand the causality. Why is the price of bitcoin rising? It may be speculative, it may not be, but it is not because it needs new cash (bitcoin doesn't need demand to outpace supply just to maintain it's utility) Bitcoin’s true value in conceptual terms is determined by it’s marginal utility in relation to other monetary units. Where bitcoin falls short (for the time being) is how widely it is an acceptable form of payment; however it offers advantages in liquidity, and it is being accepted by more and more vendors every day. It is in these conceptual underpinnings of money that we can understand where bitcoin is marginally advantageous to traditional fiat. This is the causality behind it’s rise as a means of transferring wealth.
It is in these terms that you misunderstand bitcoins, and while the speculative nature of the bitcoin market may frustrate you, it is important to maintain logical cohesion when analyzing the bitcoin market. Speculation will come and go, bitcoins are about become an acceptable alternative to tradition fiat and in these terms the price of 1 BTC is irrelevant. And because of this fact it is not a pyramid, it is a currency.
TLDR: Price of BTC may be speculative or be market equilibrium, no one will ever know, however it’s value lies in it’s ability to behave as a currency, as a better alternative to fiat, and in this way it is not a pyramid.

dollar and pound can have colloquial and non-proper definitions, I am not sure about euro though, slang isn't allowed either

How can bitcoin evolve in order to increase its liquidity?
@_date: 2013-12-31 00:35:30
The capacity of the network to facilitate transactions. And I don't mean by adding new hardware but by improving the process?
