good thing you used all 0s behind the initial coefficient, because it'll make it easier for them to erase the coefficient and leave only 0s when the price drops like a rock in the not too distant future, LOLZ

angry? LOL, i'm laughin my ass off, no anger about this.
And blockchain tech is very useful, but don't conflate that with craptocurrency as though craptocurrency is the only thing blockchain is for. A hammer is very useful, but just cause someone used it as a weapon, doesn't mean it's the best, or even a particularly good, weapon, especially compared to all the other available weapons out there, especially compared to far more effective weapons they could use against you when you're only defending yourself with a hammer

yup, as I've always said: craptocurriencies are for basement dwelling teens and grandparents. Anyone between those two ages/lifestyles should have sufficient cognitive capacity and experience to avoid such pump and dump scams, pyramid schemes
