I have a legitimate question regarding my observations during the recent market dip. I saw that there was a systematic FUD campign going on r/cryptocurrency, r/bitcoin and to lesser extent top 10 coin subs.
The typical poster profile was:
1. High karma (1 000-5 000 minimum up to 100 000)
2. Same fud link/"concern" posted at the same time on several subs
3. About 3/5 had no history in cryptcurrency subredits themes (ie not community active or coin-affiliated)
My question is, (directed mainly to high karma redditors) - have any of you been approached by persons/organisations asking you to post certain themed article links, "market concerns", (ie propagating doom/bearish atmosphere to facilitate market drop) in return for material goods/crypto/fiat?
Also, what are community concerns about this issues, have any of you fellow redditors made similar observations?
Kind regards, cheers!

I hate that type the most... see it on the NEO sub all the time. Some BCH/qtum fudsters over there as we type...

Look at the post history of this guy (OP) and all guys posting mainstream FUD...
So strange, they have almost no post histories in crypto discussions other then these anti crypto links...
@_date: 2018-02-19 06:31:16
I would say not. Judging from the post history regarding crypto you had a few anti lightning posts so you may be a bcash shill?��

Assembly line FUD... Like Kupchino trolls...
And they are getting sloppier with every new post...
Forum links? C'mon...

OP... This is not how this works. The IR increase will hurt the stock market (as higher capital cost makes venture expansion less likely, ie stock growth less likely). Some money(a lot.soon) will flow out of the stock market and into bonds, gold, and hedged in guess what... Crypto! (My guess)
We will soon see a clear divorce from stock market bears and the continuation of clear bull.
