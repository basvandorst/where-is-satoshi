A one time investment into a single tournament (Singular exposure opportunity) versus a long time investment into a Team with the added bonus of TB's reach in mainstream gaming. (multiple exposure opportunities).

To hire a designer would already be a costly investment, would it not?

If you are a freelance artist who is established and known for delivering quality, with a wife, a kid and a mortgage. You are not going to gamble many hours of work on something that might pay out big. Sorry, the world just doesn't work that way.

Unsalaried artists are people who live at home on on their  parents dime (Students and Starters). When you get your first real job, a girlfriend, a house and a dog, you'll figure out that life isn't free. That supporting your family can't be done on promises and that you actually need money in your pocket NOW to pay for stuff, instead of having your parents provide it all. But you just keep living your theoretical world. Us grown-ups have mouths to feed and bills to pay.
