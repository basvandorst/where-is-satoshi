That's not really how this works. Good encryption isn't cracked by throwing more money at it (at least not for now). If there's "a box" that's able to crack apples encryption, there's a flaw in their implementation. This box is probably not really cracking the encryption (i'd doubt that apple fucked up there) but is using some other flaw in the device to circumvent it.
A single file on a dropbox is a lot simpler and won't have any of the possible vulnerabilities a complex device like an iPhone might have. If it's encrypted with a proper algorithm, proper key, etc. it won't be decrypted by "a box" without having the key (as long as that box isn't like a huge quantum supercomputer).

The problem here seems to be that the data in the blockchain can't be removed and is going to be distributed to people who use bitcoin.
In your example, the hoster certainly will delete the content and stop distributing it if they realize that it's hosted on their servers (as long as they are afraid of law enforcement and aren't actually willingly doing something illegal). If they'd continue to distribute it, they would be made responsible for doing so and it would be illegal. As far as i understand it, it's not possible to remove the data from the blockchain. If you continue to share it with others, with that data in there, you're probably doing something very illegal. Being willing to collaborate with the police doesn't mean anything if you're continuing to share the illegal images embedded in the blockchain. "collaborate with the police" in the same way hosters do it, would mean that you won't share the blockchain anymore and delete it from your machines.
