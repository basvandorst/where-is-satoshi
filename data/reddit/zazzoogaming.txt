Is the lighning network something i can invest money into itself?
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:02:34
Can you charge a fee on your public node without mining it yourself so you can grab a little bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:52:20
Without opening the article this seems like an ICO what's am I missing here new to cryptos
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:40:16
Criminals are using the the coin monero it's much much much harder to trace 
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:09:32
Buy a hardware wallet from Trezor or ledger... trust me throw the $100 In and don't look back it makes everything super simple. If not you need to look into paper wallets but make sure you don't loose that shit haha

Can someone eli5 got a crazy r year old don't have enough time to read it all
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:33:58
Could someone run a bitcoin node a charge a 1-2% fee? Without actually mining the node themselves if so I might be interested in that.
@_date: 2019-11-21 16:07:34
Yes it goes down around this time every year and tends to spike sfter the new years
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:35:51
So it’s still not transferred this could take longer than I already have waited?
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:22:07
This guy is fucked 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:46:59
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:08:22
Yeah i was thinking about trying the same and I just don’t have enough experience yet
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:29:34
I wish I could mine bitcoin to help this isn’t possible with a 1080ti is it ?
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:37:13
Can’t tell if troll or not but im not home to check lmfao
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:11:43
Hey man just go for it if your that confident just do small amounts until your more comfortable
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:25:10
How do I get a debit card for that so if I’m understanding correct I can get a card that will shift bitcoin to us currency if needed?
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:51:59
Hey new guys we need that push to 10k it's still safe to invest imo let keep this roller coaster going
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:02:40
I can’t explain how many people I’ve told about bitcoin in the $3000 range and now their begging me to help them buy it now lol
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:38:26
Im not asking if someone knows I’m just asking in your opinion what do you think it will go down to 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:36:21
So I could take more than a day realistically 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:34:18
Can't wait to repost this gig at 20k XD
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:30:30
Wow didn’t know I could do that... how do I go amount setting something like this up 
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:33:48
And just to be clear i cant use GDX cause its a part of coinbase?
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:21:28
I havent really bought much yet and i have a $150 weekly limit for right now
@_date: 2017-09-04 23:41:35
I would be buying with USD so coinbase would work? And do different markets have different prices they will pay for bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:10:28
Thanks! Didn’t even think that feature would be hidden in settings 
@_date: 2017-10-19 23:37:39
Im more buying and trading eth/litecoin so I can build up to buy a couple bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:47:05
Okay so i wont have a weekly limit on GDAX? And then i can transfer the bitcoin to coinbase?
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:29:54
Went to download it anyways to try it out doesn’t have ETH or LTE pricing 
@_date: 2017-10-22 06:38:05
I have no idea what this means can you ELI5?
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:45:33
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:38:51
Are these safe like paper wallets?
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:43:55
It would prob be a couple months money is tight rn 
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:16:10
So we have to have btc on coinbase to receive this? It cannot be in our wallets?
@_date: 2017-10-19 23:42:45
I am looking into one of those wallets just still a little confused how it works in terms of getting it on and off coin base.. I am using the GDAX and buying/selling with limit orders.. I made a couple of small gain here and there I don’t think I have enough money into it right now for holding on to it to be worth it.  I want to build up what I got right now so I can make a investment  happy to hold onto for a while.   I also went into this with one investment and I’m not trying to add anything else hence why I feel the need to build it up.
@_date: 2017-10-20 03:21:45
Could you please elaborate I think i kinda might know what you mean.
@_date: 2017-09-04 01:32:45
Arent they thousands of dollars for just one? How does this work
@_date: 2017-09-04 23:37:03
Dump than pump? Haha ... im a complete noob like where should i buy bitcoin what apps do i use and where do i sell?
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:55:56
Im a little confused with step 5 &amp; 6 could you maybe ELI5 I just want to know everything before I make the jump... also a paper wallets just as secure as hardware wallets if done the right way?
@_date: 2017-10-22 08:01:11
Okay that pretty much settles my question... is the hardware wallets more simple to set up?
@_date: 2017-09-04 23:27:42
How does someone invest into bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:12:05
If it takes more time will I still get the BcG if my sent payment was confirmed just not showing in trezor?
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:04:39
Unless I’m missing something I can only make alerts for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:35:42
Im not a smart person but what I took from this is that people can easily manipulate the market .. its basically like this in everything similar I thought? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:47:43
So for example I have all my btc on my trezor for the fork on the 25th how will I receive these new coins where will they even be sent ?
@_date: 2017-10-04 01:36:12
So other than that wait 4 days?
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:53:34
Gotcha so once trezor supports the coin which is likley it will show up in our trezor wallets? Sorry I just want to be extra clear
@_date: 2017-10-22 09:39:23
What is btcgold 
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:01:19
Free bitcoin gold whats that?
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:35:20
when I move them back to coinbase or the exchange from a paper wallet will it be delayed or work right away?
Could you point me into the right direction of one of the better paper wallets?
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:15:50
Im not really looking for percentage based alerts I just want me phone to go off no matter what if a coin hits a certain price percentage alerts seems kinda stupid to me tbh
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:14:36
Who’s giving free bitcoin gold? And where do we receive it? And just to be clear all I have to do is have money into bitcoin and have it in a paper wallet and then I will receive the free gold?
Sorry for asking so many questions you just explained it really well.
