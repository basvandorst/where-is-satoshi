I have a question about receiving payments.
I get that Alice and Bob both deposit some BTC in their channel,and can then send and receive and at some point in the future settle up.
Now say Alice opens a shop that wants to accept BTC through the lightning network. Wouldn't the hub she connects to (the one that connects her to the rest of the network) also have to deposit some BTC? Otherwise she can't receive anything via that channel? Or am I missing something? Genuinly curios

Thanks for the reply!
I think I am following you, but what if Alice never makes a purchase first? She just wants to be able to receive from customers so they don’t have high tx fees.
What’s the incentive for the hub to add some BTC to the channel between itself and Alice? Do they take any fees for being the hub?

In every deal there is somebody who makes an offer (maker), an somebody who accepts that offer (taker). 
Offers can either be to buy at a certain price, or sell at a certain price. 
On GDAX, when you are the one posting an offer, you pay 0 fees. When you are the one accepting an offer you pay 0.25% of the total amount.
You can only post a bit offer that is at least 1 cent lower than the lowest sell offer, and vice versa only post a sell offer that is at least 1 cent more expensive than the highest buy offer.
You can post an offer for a price that is already there, your offer just gets added to the pile on that price where it is first come, first served.
However, to post and offer on GDAX it has to be for at least 0.01 BTC (about $100 right now) so if you were to buy for example for $50 you can only be the ‘taker’ who accepts the offer and you will incur the 0.25% fee.
Example: you enter the ‘market order’ for how many dollars you want to spend ($50) and click ‘buy’. GDAX will then execute your order where it will buy BTC for ($50 - 0.25% = $49.87) at the cheapest price available and add that amount of BTC to your GDAX account.
From there you can either sell the bitcoin again, or move it to your own wallet (look up why that is important if you are in for the long term)
Hope this helps!

Do you know a good alternative for iOS? I’ll switch today if you point me in the right direction
