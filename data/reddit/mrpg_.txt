I can't really tell since I purchased the vast majority of my Bitcoins many, many years ago from a friend.
The Bitcoins I've bought since then could be bought very easily; here in Germany, AML/KYC is not such a pain in the ass. I've been using Bitcoin.de (which is also really nice) for quite some time now.
So overall, my experience with Bitcoin can only be described as very good and nearly perfect.
@_date: 2016-04-08 16:52:44

I just recently deleted my Kraken account. The identification procedure for Germans is just too intrusive. They claim a high amount of fraud from Germans, but... um... SEPA transfers cannot be reversed. There cannot be fraud by definition. Too shady imho, even though I liked them one year ago. Very cheap exchange as well. 
I am currently using Bitcoin.de. I really like them. If you have a Fidor Bank account, like me, it's a pleasure to use them. It's all automatic. 
To test Coinbase I sent them a few euros. I am quite interested in what they have to offer. Their verification was very good as well.

I believe updates are somehow cryptographically signed and must be manually confirmed by the user on the Trezor itself before being installed.
@_date: 2015-06-28 10:39:40
1. Other cryptocurrencies usually have higher fluctuation and lower transaction volume. Bitcoin is in my opinion THE cryptocurrency.
2. Cloud mining is usually considered to be a bad investment. I did it when I was younger (:D) and it was not worth it. Since computational power and difficulty increase, a fixed number of GHS will be worth less in the future.
3. No. 899.75 bits 4. GreenAddress is pretty neat. I personally use Electrum on a dedicated Bitcoin device (an old, fully encrypted Linux netbook), which works extremely well, but most people recommend paper wallets (cold wallets) and/or using a Trezor. I don’t like paper wallets (too unflexible) but I will certainly buy a Trezor in the near future.
If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.

True. Shows how the prohibition of insider trading is just another mechanism to protect the ruling class because it disincentivizes whistleblowing so much.
@_date: 2015-06-20 12:34:49
No. An exchange can be perfectly kewl without having verification *as long as other criteria are met*, like a minimum level of trustworthiness. Verification inspires this trustworthiness, but it is not at all necessary.

Only if the receiving bank and the receiving party consent. It is a lengthy process due to § 675y Abs. 3 BGB and it is by no means possible to reverse a credit transfer as easily as a *Lastschrift*.

That’s true. But if you have a Fidor account, it is quite relaxing. The only thing that annoys me is the Bitcoin withdrawal limit.

People disagree about the extent of property rights. I, for one, am as far pro property rights as possible but others disagree. Bitcoin tends to enforce property rights in regard to currency and that’s why I like it. But others want to enslave people even more, take even more of their property (of course, what they say is "higher taxes" and what they mean is "tax everybody that is richer than meeeeeee ^BUT ^NOT ^MYSELF "), and, well, that’s not possible with bitcoin. Thus bitcoin is not kewl for them.

Bitcoin was outlawed by all governments except small countries in Europe and the Caribbean. Providing a full node or running bitcoin or your digital computer became a federal offense in most countries around the globe – because bitcoin is not safe for children, of course. The cryptocurrency that took its place is called govcoin and does not have an upper limit of coins and is mined only by the central banks. Probably every country has its own govcoin. Former bitcoin users had to hand over their coins for 1/10th of the market value and they were compensated with govcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-12 12:44:00


They will increase by exactly zero percent, except if you are running a full node on your old Nokia or Siemens C25, of course. You should read this as: If you are running a full node on decent hardware, your costs will not increase.
The costs may rise when someday we have much more transactions. But until then, increasing the maximum size of blocks will in itself not lead to higher costs. And until then, Moore’s law will deliver as well. I do not believe than costs of running a full node will become higher. The logic just doesn’t exactly check out.

@_date: 2015-06-07 16:43:44
It could compromise your anonymity if an attacker can break Blockchain's TLS encryption. If you make a transaction to address X and the attacker sees that someone visited X's (or the transaction's) site on Blockchain, he could assume from your IP that you are either sender or recipient. That's a pretty big deal actually. 
That would also apply if Blockchain was a compromised service run by the NSA altogether. I personally cannot condone looking up receiver's or your addresses on public websites, even those with HTTP encryption. You should not look up your transactions either once they have come through. It's just not worth it.

@_date: 2015-06-11 08:15:39
It surprised me as well. The great advantage of running bitcoind yourself as a porn site is that you don’t depend on other companies’ feelings. Even cool payment processors like Bitpay may change their point of view on this issue and PayPal/Visa/etc. are very reserved to everything that is only slightly adult, to say the least. And if you sell the Bitcoins that you have collected, your identity doesn’t matter since on the market, everybody is equal.
Combined with everything else Bitcoin stands for, this is hands-down the best payment system currently available to them.

I find the idea of a more computer science based discussion to be somewhat more appealing as well, but bitcoin is not just maths and computer science. If you add together everything bitcoin consists of in a metaphysical way, like the science and mathematics behind it, and you try to build the same on green grassland, you will end up with *less* than bitcoin.
Bitcoin consists of humans. It is only viable because of social interaction. Making changes to the form of social interactions will always lead to resistance. And even though I find resistance against increasing block size to be more appalling than appealing, I accept that bitcoin has no value without human acceptance. That’s why I would never call bitcoin-related dissent "ideological" – every side has reasons for their decision and they do not follow them because they are stupid or ideologues. They may expect a higher personal reward if the block size is changed or not. They want to follow the "true word" of the white paper (whatever this is). They cannot accept bigger blocks because of their internet connection. Other people maybe want bitcoin to stay an elitist experiment. Ok, whatever. But to dismiss that as purely ideological is, to quote the late Michael Corleone, "wrong. It’s wrong and it’s dangerous".
What I want to say is that bitcoin has absolutely no value (as an experiment and as a currency) without the consent and the acceptance of the underlying social interactions. Bitcoin is a *voluntary* sociological experiment of great magnitude. Joint solutions must be found, compromises be made. The success or failure of bitcoin will indicate whether this all-important insight prevailed. And every change that is to be made to these crucial interactions must be carefully reviewed. That is why I endorse every discussion and I challenge everyone to do the same.

@_date: 2015-06-09 19:02:19
It’s dangerous as well. If some wallet shows its willingness to manipulate my transaction, then how can I be sure it behaves correctly otherwise?
Not that I am against this fee. I think it is a great idea that should be included in all wallet software. It could also be much higher in my opinion, up to 0.001 BTC. But making it automatic and non-optout… this is somewhat uncannily.

Fiat may be bad, but millennials haven’t seen the system crash yet. But being a millennial myself I can surely say that most of my peers had heard about Bitcoin before I told them about it. The nice thing is that the neocon "hurr durr, it’s used for DRUGS! ONLINE!" doesn’t work on them because most of them don’t give any remote crap at all whatsoever.
So, yes, I believe you can be optimistic about millennials. But as long as it is still comfortable to sit at home, wearing your silver necklace and paying with fiat, they won’t be too concerned about Bitcoin. I think, however, that there is a positive mindset among those that already know Bitcoin. And they are a bit interested in it as well, but they don’t know how to take the first step.

I have been using Blockchain.info's wallet for several (&gt;2) years now and I am very satisfied with their services. At the moment, I keep all my bitcoins on cold storage, but when I had them on their online wallet, they always seemed well-fed and none went missing. Blockchain.info does not keep your private key, so it's all about your browser's security (and Javascript, of course).
It seems to me that their wallet is very easy to use and secure. They even send you wallet backups automatically if you want and notify you of incoming transactions.

It would be nice if we had the possibility to request a "donation" address from nodes. One idea would be to split up the current miner's fee or to create another voluntary fee that would go directly to a randomly selected node's donation address.
I personally run a 24/7 bitcoin node that has more than 35 connections on average and I am eager to donate my server to the network. But I think that giving a small amount with every transaction to one of the nodes would be a nice move for those people that want to do something for the network, but cannot.

This depends on the client that you are using and how new addresses are being generated. If you use a HD wallet like Electrum or Mycelium, you can just enter the seed on several devices. If you want to use different softwares to access this identical wallet, you should software that uses the same HD wallet standard because Electrum is doing its own kind of thing there I believe. But if you use Bitcoin Core, every digital computer on which you copy your wallet.dat will create their own new addresses AFAIK. Someone with more expertise might correct me here, but the basic scheme is like that. If you use these seeds you would - theoretically - also not have to update your backups once made. But for data security reasons, you should do it nevertheless because data can be lost.
But be advised that this significantly decreases security. One hacked device can be enough to compromise your whole wallet — across different digital computers. If the chance of any given device to be hacked in a specific time interval is 0.01 (1%), then using multiple devices with the same wallet leads to a chance of not being hacked of 0.99^*n* with *n* being the number of devices. Not being hacked becomes exponentially more unlikely.

Tbh I always asked myself how I can transfer money from Germany to the United States without them having to exchange cash… until I found out that it works with correspondent banks and thus with complex IOU structures that lead to high fees. It is clear that in this sense alone bitcoin is far superior.

No. Blockchain.info is still the best service for this (as long as you use it with TOR).
It should theoretically be easy to implement a taint checker. You basically just have to resolve the transactions and follow their origin (or for the reverse taint, their destination). But apparently nobody wants to do it.
@_date: 2015-07-10 15:53:11
Nice. I love how all the other methods would take forever — but for Bitcoin it’s just five minutes.
@_date: 2015-07-16 16:54:35
Yes. They could try to submit like 1,000,000,000 valid transactions with high fees.

Problems that occured to me:


Your survey does not allow me to specify 4 years.


The possible answers are too imprecise.


What if I had exactly 1 or 5 or 10 or 20 BTC?


What if it was exactly 5%?


Your survey does not allow multiple answers.

Gee whiz, that is probably true. How could I be so foolish?

Was there not this limit that you could only make a transaction if all outputs were larger than $SomeNotSoSmallAmount? Did they abandon it?

Same here. Every time someone here pulls a Debbie Downer or puts on their complainipants I have the feeling that my transactions are confirmed even faster than normal. 
But I am also not particularly thrifty. I always use at least 0.0001 BTC and on the other hand, my transactions are also quite small. So maybe my view of reality is warped. 
EDIT: I should clarify that the kilobyte size of my transactions is small. Most of the time just one input and max two outputs. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 09:05:09
But not 100000% more than the other alternatives. Quite the opposite, actually.
It’s just that Bitcoin is a nuisance for them, probably. They want to drive out Bitcoiners.

That is most certainly true. But at least the chance exists if they abandon the euro. Right now, they don’t have chances.

@_date: 2015-07-21 12:33:26
Note that this possibly reveals your identity to the Blockchain.info providers. It is somewhat strange if some IP suddenly checks a bitcoin address in such a precise manner; it is therefore tremendously insecure to perform this check without TOR. It is still insecure to check with TOR, but much less so.
@_date: 2015-07-23 16:27:03
Still $1.98 more than with bitcoin though

I feel the same way about Electrum… I mean… it feels not random enough if the seed is generated in like 0.0001 seconds :/

Maybe Kraken works for you, but I know that it is very difficult for German citizens, let alone German residents (I think).
Localbitcoins is not available in Germany, unfortunately. Mycelium local trading works though.
In an extreme emergency, I could also help you out (I have a Fidor account as well).

Nice. Go would be cool as well because it can't be computed as easily as chess. And the rules are pretty simple. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 14:53:29


Yes, and this is highly unusual. Enough to come up with the idea that this address or one of the transactions belonged to the IP requesting it.
But you’re right about the TOR part. As long as TOR can be considered secure in this regard, this connection between computer and address cannot be "easily" established.
@_date: 2015-07-15 16:51:31
The exchanges that are available in Germany are not too great, unfortunately. Bitcoin.de is quite good though, I think.
Mycelium local trading will probably be the best and cheapest option if you are looking for a fast method. If you want to buy bitcoin regularly, a real exchange is of course much better.

Yeah, Xapo is quite good. Unfortunately, one really gets burned by their exchange rate… about 2% hidden fees for every transaction.

For credit transfer, I tried Cashila several times so far; worked flawlessly. The fee came out as about 1.5%. Pretty good if you ask me.
