done. any thoughts exactly on the subject? )

that was the point, I believe..but once you go black you never come back, meaning here that traders will switch to another exchanges and won't get back to mtgox even if they resume withdrawals. Reputation is everything in this business

hi! 
we can provide you with a free js scrypt, that shows actual BTC equivalent of the displayed USD price and vice versa
Example &lt;span class="cryptonator" data-pair="USD-BTC" data-amount="25"&gt;25 USD&lt;/span&gt; on mouse over will show your customer current BTC equivalent of 25 USD and vice versa &lt;span class="cryptonator" data-pair="BTC-USD" data-amount="0.1"&gt;0.1 BTC&lt;/span&gt; on mouse over will show your customer current USD equivalent of 0.1 BTC
is that what you were looking for?

We are going to keep both IDs and Secrets hashed, so hacking/leaking the database won't really harm


This is unlikely to happen, since IDs are hashed + we will activate some sort of a hardcore captcha after 3 failed attempts

login is blocked for 60 sec regardless of the IP, so you would have only 2000 attempts per day, which is actually nothing...moreover such activity is monitored
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:12:14
well, not quite
most of the sites use email/password
we don't
@_date: 2014-06-10 11:15:09
not quite actually, they lost my 5usd in bitcoin. dont care about that, but still
@_date: 2014-05-06 10:41:40
Well, in your case this is a classic login/password or brainwallet scheme, which means keeping access data in your head. 
But since most humans can't easily keep passwords like DQdMzLD3BaeQACZEf5EA6NitfCaseHh3LD in their heads, access data tends to be pretty simple and alike.
And that causes problems. Moreover, device you are using could be hacked or infected, so everything you do is monitored by a bad guy.

GA is a very simple program, which does not access your phone number, contacts etc, it does not even require an internet connection to work.
I mentioned a mobile device because this is a piece of hardware which is always at hand. Basically there is a GA extension for browsers, and it could be also used for the authorization purpose. 
Concerning centralization by using GA - I see your point. In fact there are many other apps out there, such as Authy, Duo Mobile, HDE OTP etc. 
There's also a possibility allowing logging in with the secret key only, in case GA inaccessible or you simply don't want it

keep us posted, would love have a beer for bitcoin

Well, firstly you need to know the login. Assuming you know it, adding some custom hardcore captcha would help against bots. Assuming your bot is able to unlock our captcha, we could allow users logging in using their secret key only.
Alphanumerics are easy to remember, most of the users' logins are alphanumerics. But it takes nothing to allow other characters as well, it won't bring any harm, I think
I would appreciate your further critics

any solutions for iPhone users (since there are no bitcoin-wallets for iOS anytime soon), except trashing the device?
@_date: 2014-05-24 14:09:38
We are going
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:24:11
I paid freelancers for various programming jobs (website coding)
@_date: 2014-03-09 15:26:30
nice, but functionality lacks. This one -  converts over 250 cryptocurrencies into fiat money or into other cryptocurrencies
@_date: 2014-04-17 18:33:45
c'mon, hit us with some critics
@_date: 2014-05-19 10:46:02
thanks! 
But this one requires internet connection between a mobile device and the authentication server for every login session, which theoretically makes classic man-in-the-middle attack possible
Also a lot of centralization by using their app only.

I spoke with our programmers, and hey, we could provide you with the script that on mouseover shows actual USD equivalent of the stated BTC price. Rates are updated every minute. Should you be interested pls email: contact[at]cryptonator.com 
p.s. free of charge, of course
@_date: 2014-03-12 08:12:47
right...well, we can include some formatting options both suitable for desktops and mobiles/tablets
