Its not put and take ponzi scheme. It is an asset. A very risky but promising. You need to understand lots of fundamentals to estimate it properly and then take those risks. It seems crazy but it might become the best store of value(energy).

Not a very open person , and these events dont take place often in my country. Also it is much better not to be a public person for security reasons. E.G.: founder of local crypto exchange was brought to woods by governmental security (KGB alike) and forced to give up access to his funds.

At this point you need to understand, when everyone is fearful or skeptic- buy! You have a good strategy. Most People dont understand fundamentals of economic growth, socialism etc. Bitcoin will guide you to the fundamental principles if you ask yourself proper questions and seek answers.

If there is a problem with a government and a taxation system it is ... you know what i mean.  At some point we would all need to make a choice - to adopt everything to a taxation system or find the other way.. Frankly speaking i am happy not to be a citizen of the first world big gov state.

Idk... store is selling btc labeled t-shirts and hats and some other btc stuff. But on the back of everything they also use logo of their store “The house of Nakamoto” or something.
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:34:35
I also think it might be better , cuz most people not buying btc/eth saying they are expansive (they dont understand), then they just buying some very high risk coins or scam coins, then they just get burned and flame cryptoassets in general. These ICOs burned lots of people. Thats good there is no more scamcoin ads everywhere.
There were/are no ads for bitcoin. There were/are no ads for stocks either.

Freedom was not always like that. Years of suffering till true freedom comes. I have freedom to spend it anywhere i want if “we” agree. But i cannot spend money on my credit card however i want. Freezes, delays, permissions. Even when cashing out at ATM. You might misunderstand the initial idea. 
And yes when BTC costs 4000 dollars you definitely don’t wanna use it. And this drives growth as well.

Can you please explain me some more, sir. LN is an off chain, but what happens to bitcoin when you use LN. Do they move anywhere , or just hold and wait for the settlement on LN (in the end/when you quit) to make transactions on the btc blockchain? LN website doesnt explain this clearly.

This is the hardest part, there is never a perfect time. My suggestion is to do it in a while , share the risks. Do it when it dips,  dont listen to anyone , make your own decisions , so you can always move forward. Just split the amount you want to spend into some parts. And do it weekly, monthly, yearly - whatever your plan is.

If you want to send 384 satoshi its not a good idea to send via blockchain, you better use lightning then. Hope exchanges will soon get lightning support as well
