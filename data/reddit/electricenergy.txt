Are you from the 1960s?
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:31:28
Tons of them. That generation is retarded.

What issues specifically are you talking about? I don't know a huge amount about btc, but as far as i know, it can't be "stolen" unless you accidentally allow someone to access it.

Credit card information can be stolen the same way, but it is true that if you are unable to keep your key secure there is no one to reimburse your loss.
@_date: 2016-09-22 02:52:57
I would just love to hear your reasoning on that comment.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:55:12
I don't see the problem here. Are we to ignore reality in the name of political correctness? I would argue that that is actually more racist.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:21:49
I don't even know what to say to people like you. YOU are the people who are propagating racism and giving it power.
You're talking like you want to apply science to the issue, but don't know the difference between a logical biconditional and a regular conditional.

You are being ridiculous. The guy said that all the scammers that *he* encounters are Indian. Not that all scammers are Indian.
Keep scrolling and maybe you'll find some more green-lights to be a SJW knob.

I thought this only worked in EVE!

There you go putting words in my mouth again. I said its a biased system. Obviously it's not impossible to succeed. 
The average American can't even afford to go to a doctor when they get sick.
Going to school puts them so far into debt that they can't even think about having a net-worth for years (sometimes decades) afterwards.
And yet the military industrial complex keeps building tanks that the army's generals don't even want and don't use, so they sit in giant parking lots rusting away and going out of date.
Your privatized prison system lobbies for legislation perpetuating the war on drugs so that they can pack otherwise innocent, non violent people into already overcrowded prisons.
Your banks intentionally game the economy, causing things like the recent housing crisis because they know that whatever minuscule fines their corporation has to pay will be far outweighed by the profit they will make off of ruining their own country. All while keeping their jobs, and receiving their yearly bonuses.
And to top it off, Donald Fucking Trump is starting to look more and more like a viable candidate for president. You couldn't make this shit up.
The list goes on and on. The CIA overthrowing democratically elected governments in foreign countries, selling weapons to your "enemies", bringing in the majority of the cocaine supply in the 80s and directly funding your crazy fucked up banking system with it.
Your president pretended that there were weapons of mass destruction in a country you weren't even in conflict with just so that he could convince the public to go along with an invasion. And you wonder why people fly planes into your buildings.
I mean, I get why people resist thinking about all that stuff. It's not a pretty picture. But to say that the upper class isn't playing games with you is just flat out lunacy.
@_date: 2015-10-14 16:50:25
Never said that. There you go again.
@_date: 2015-10-24 04:05:53
nobody even has any idea what the fucking word means.
@_date: 2015-10-12 23:24:08
Because I understand that I'm part of the lower class playing a rigged game. 
Unfortunately, at the moment it's the only game. You don't get to stop playing just because you realize that its biased against you.
Crypto-currencies, for the time being are our best chance for changing that. The beauty is that it is totally decentralized and trustless. You only run into trouble with it when people attempt to centralize. Look at mtgox for example.
If you're too stupid to secure your own data, then not only is crypto-currency not for you, but you will be left behind in the digital era.
@_date: 2015-10-14 17:49:35
I dont even have to. I think I see the whats happening here.
I come from a civilized country where we get actual real educations.
You are a typical semi-literate American
The rest of the world would be laughing at your quasi-first world country if they weren't so damned terrified of it.
Perhaps our paradigms are too separated for actual communication.
Enjoy your hyper-Orwellian dystopia you great supine protoplasmic invertebrate jelly.

Use your fucking head dummy
@_date: 2015-10-12 18:54:28
This guy didnt update his banking app. He deleted his key, of which he had no backup. Thats the same as taking a wad of cash and lighting it on fire.
If you need to have your hand held so badly, then you're going to have to deal with your banking system utterly destroying your economy every couple decades while the guys  on top laugh about trickle down economics.
@_date: 2015-10-13 04:42:02
Just don't delete your only copy of a file worth $2800 maybe?
@_date: 2015-10-14 16:33:59
I think you should look up the definition for conspiracy and give your a head a shake kid. Those are all well documented events. You live in a fairy tail. I'm no victim. I employ tens of people and do just fine for myself.
Next thing you'll say is that I'm "middle class". Guess what. That's just something that the lower class with a little bit of money call themselves to feel superior.
This conversation is over. Clearly you are beyond reason. Please do not continue to contact me.
@_date: 2015-10-13 19:43:37
Is this how you talk to people in real life? Just cherry pick and change th conversation so that you can win with pedantry?
I tried. Enjoy you're pathetic existence.
@_date: 2015-10-12 06:18:20
I guess you're not from America.
@_date: 2015-10-13 04:33:05
I forgot what we were talking about. Some idiot who burned money or something? What the fuck is your problem.
@_date: 2017-05-02 00:17:01
You're ridiculous.
