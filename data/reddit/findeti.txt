Terrorists eat, then food is evil.

you should not do it. This is the lesson. Do you trust the guy changing dolar-euro at the corner shop to let him thousands of dolars at his shop just to make fast phone trading?

In the mnemonic bip there is a checksum. If you change a little bit your 12 words you are not getting a valid set of 12 words.

Well, I have seen it, I tested it and it worked for me. I am sure that they will open the beta testing sooner or later.

I have been alpha testing coinffeine and it is not vaporware. Building a descentralized exchange is not an easy problem to solve. It is really easy to label things you don't know as vaporware.

The mnemonic &lt;-&gt; seed is a bijection. So, if you have the actual seed in bytes you can reverse the operation and obtain your mnemonic. 
On the other side, if what you have is derivation of the seed (i.e. the master key of one account) you will not be able to restore your mnemonic.

Do you really expect that I answer your stupid conclusions to silly jokes?
