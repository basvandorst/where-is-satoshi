He knows nothing about bitcoin, yet he's trying to teach us how it works by saying prove me wrong. The whole "prove me wrong" argument is better known as 'Argumentum Ad Ignorantiam', or better known as ignorance.

Are you seriously trying to reason with a moron? What is the point?

No it can't. If you don't believe me then take this tx id and try to trace it back to my bank account. 


To see how big the fee is and possibly show you how to push it through. Doubt anybody will do that for you now since you were such an asshole/dumbass. 


Then why the fuck did you tell everybody about it on reddit?


Moneygram is down the street. 


Because you are a dumbass?


Fuck you too chief.

Of course the exchange can, they have her banking information because she bought bitcoin there. 


This is not how bitcoin works. 




Pretty much answered your own question there chief. 


Says the guy that doens't know anything about bitcoin and is telling people how it works. 
Don't use tools that you don't intend on learning how to use, and don't get mad when genuine people offer help. You can see yourself out of our community now.

I actually caught what OP wrote before he deleted it. Somehting like:
"I obviously came to the wrong place for help. Fuck all you idiots."
Joke is on him because he's the fucking idiot. How are we supposed to help him with his transaction if he doesn't post the wallet or IDTX? Are we just supposed to guess which transaction out of the thousands of transactions? Level 9k troll or truly remarkable dumbass.

I'm seeking legal opinions about the recent hardfork and an exchange that isn't offering up BCH. 
Just recently a [hardfork]( happend and bitcoin split into two on August 1st, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. A majority of exchanges expressed their intent not to offer BCH or support for the alt blockchain. A few supported the new blockchain and has offered the BCH to their customers. localbitcoins.com made this [statement]( on July 19th. They made this statement on their public forum, blog, twitter, and facebook. The day after the fork, an Admin made [this]( statement on a thread in the forum.
My question is directed towards somebody who practices law as a contracts lawyer in Finland, but anybody is free to offer up their opionion. Is there any legal recourse here for users to attempt to get their BCH, or is LBC covered by their statements. Are they even required to offer the BCH regardless of their statements. 
Thanks for looking in to this. I'll be cross posting this in a few sections because I really want to reach out to somebody who practices in this area. Thanks for your time.

My thoughts exactly. I tried explaining this to the people on the forum at LBC and there are about 15 people who think they are entitled to BCH. It's hard to explain to people who won't reason.

I agree. This isn't normal behavior.
