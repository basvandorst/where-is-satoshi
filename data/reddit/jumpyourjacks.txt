Not really. Greed can cause the deaths of thousands, and has. So one death to prevent that would be correct from the the right viewpoints.

And I'm supposed to recognize him from this picture four years later?
Come on. This is nuts. "Someone might be Satoshi" doesn't make me money. I only have a minorly vague interest until we get confirmation on someone. In which case then I will pay attention
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:57:26
WTF does what you are saying have to do with the real world? I'm sorry you can't get laid.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:52:36
I'd work on being able to do both still.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:36:24
Yeah but isn't segwit just bad tech for longevity? Is this really how we want the main crypto operating?
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:04:08
Yeah the tax break for children that costs all people who don't have children money is not very American in ideology but it has nothing to do with this and really isn't fucking relevant.

I'm not wrong he says directly in the OP that the accounts haven't been touched. Thanks for wasting my time though
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:36:06
This is bad advice for spreading crypto through the world. Which is the goal.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:49:27
It was nowhere near then as I visually saw your comment pop up. So that's weird.
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:40:21
That's not what your mom said
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:32:22
I'm not a shill. That's just literally how the technology verifies itself man. I didn't invent blockchain so don't put that on me. I only own BTC no BCH right now.
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:34:30
Who is Y'all? It's still several 100% up from where I bought and I sold everything at 18k (so double that again) and just bought back in. Think y'all fell victim to being too stupid to play the game and read the market.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:36:46
Doesn't change the fact that Segwit was a shitty fix in general. I'm team BTC I am just saying
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:36:26
It's having strong hands

It's pretty easy to forget 4 years ago
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:55:37
Lol this is literally probably true. Sad but true.
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:33:19
They weren't right though. I sold my coins at 18k and just bought again because that's how the game is played. This is not out of the ordinary. He's annoyed because people who don't know shit run their mouths because they are too stupid to just look in to it.
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:16:38
I only pay attention to tech related news and news that influences price. Theres not much else to pay attention to. If it doesn't help my bottom line it's just fandom

A 30 drink is pretty ridiculous even with Tip in America. I work at a high end place and this can only really happen with over priced Tequila, Whiskey of a variety or Wine and none of them are worth 30 a pour.
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:05:58
No it wasn't down percantage wise. It stayed at almost 10% which is way more than it was before it's last run up a week before the dip the meme is referencing
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:58:40
Sure but you also can't predict tops. Just holding forever means you never make anything but a level of smugness. The market dipped back to the 50 day exactly like it should have. Maybe I was lucky but I wonder why the technical analysis backs up my decision then? There was obviously going to be a pullback at some point. I could have been selling too early. That's a risk you take.
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:12:36
A lot of socially insecure(or just socially stupid) dudes invest in Bitcoin. Don't worry, the guy who was a dick for no reason will have a ton of upvotes because people have weak character.
You literally can't be of strong character if you go around berating peoples looks you'll never know
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:49:58
It wasn't even a third from the bottom when the comment showed up on mine
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:38:28
Until you can buy everything with BTC, Fiat is still far more important and it's valuation in relation to Fiat, regardless of what anyone tells you for ideological reasons is the only thing that actually matters until it becomes a functional separate currency. Which is pretty far away. It's not even close right now.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:56:13
Greed murders people by the millions. Murdering one rich person murders one person. Maybe your viewpoint is too narrowed on individuals and not society
I personally do not advocate for murder either but if you can't at least understand his use of hyperbole in this situation and why the language isn't to far from appropriate than I am sorry for you
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:26:18
... Except not. Bitcoin crashed harder than all the Fiat's shown, and ether tanked a ton too. This makes no sense.
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:32:01
Not really. Someone with no coins has almost certainly done 0 research. Once you've looked into it enough it typically means you're in. So the people that are "no-coiners" literally dont know shit
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:59:56
No it wasn't though. The hype was still building around the futures markets opening. You have to look at the entire picture. Futures markets opening were going to eventually bring stability though so selling right before they launched made sense. Anyway if you have a better way of doing things I'm glad its working out for you. But just holding for eternity is literally the worst option possible
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:40:50
Didn't somebody just move $400mil worth for $1 using segwit?
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:06:52
I bought at 250. Ether is doing fine. You're right but it did lose over 30%
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:00:51
How do you know it's upvoted? The score is hidden still
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:01:07
Because he isn't actually relevant. It is reasonable 
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:55:49
What? I don't hate crypto? I bought 12% of my savings in BTC at 3.5k I sold BTC at 18k then bought at 12k then sold at 16 again. This stretch has been great. I sold all my Litecoin at 380 and put it ALL in ether and just sold. I'm happy as shit with the market
Your comment was a cruel kind of dickery for no reason and yeah a lot of "incels" are in to crypto
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:12:18
Yeah but saying something will happen in the future is different than what they are saying which is it will happen now.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:39:16
Okay you stated your opinion but literally no reasoning behind. On first approach your opinion sounds incredibly stupid. There is literally no reason to have your opinion besides for you to feel superior for splitting your own coins.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:12:04
This forum is literally all stupid memes. Worse than adviceanimals

No I'm talking about hours ago
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:59:03
I don't understand the opposite. The part of the sub that thinks you have to Hodl til you die. If you haven't cashed out when you die you LOST ALL THE money. You made nothing.
The idea of holding forever is fucking terrible advice. Selling on a dip is bad unless you hit your stop loss. Then NOT selling on a dip can be bad.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:17:13
Weird how there is articles about it posted on this sub. But yeah I'm misinformed.
They shut it down after.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:16:34
Because basically once you you make Bitcoin fast an feeless you take away the only draw some of these coins have.

It's a nickname. Nicknames aren't chosen by those who have them
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:12:46
It's possible the correction is right now. It hint 19k earlier and is now down to 16k.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:15:16
Actually I have been. Right before every big dip the site has gone down on me.....
I like how you don't understand the idea of property and theft.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:32:11
I would buy Eth and litecoin right now. If you're looking for an opportunity they tend to bounce up after bitcoin spikes like this too
I'd always buy bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:14:30
You realize just setting up a wallet for the people who are just entering the crypto space right now is mind boggling right? There is a massive intellectual cost of entry into the crypto space for the average person and we need to cater to them not to those of us who understand how things work.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:16:08
No I think eventually if Tether keeps on being a thing claiming to be backed in USD the DoJ will shut it down

@_date: 2017-12-29 17:10:51
Selling at 18-19k was a no brainer though. Your dad was smart. I sold and bought back at 13,500. Was pretty confident in my sell
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:28:11
Youre fucking stupid
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:29:00
Selling at 18-19k was a good move. Just buy back
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:07:02
I almost agree, but isn't the entire argument that this type of branding massively hurts the possibility of adoption into a system that already has a massively high intellectual cost of entry for the average person? There is no benefit to calling it Bitcoin Cash. The pettiness is insisting it be called that.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:15:40
Energy consumption is only an issue because modern society will only invest in the immediate future not the actual future.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:05:26
There is no one who actively trades without coins on an exchange. Do you not get that? It's not possible otherwise. If you think the opinion of traders doesn't matter then whose does? Just people using it like an IRA?
I don't think they should have to split the coins. I just think they shouldn't be holding the coins still for months after the fork. Again how do you not get this? There isn't even two points of view. They are holding things that don't belong to them.
For the record I split my coins. This does not affect me. That doesn't change the fact it's unethical
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:14:47

@_date: 2017-12-02 15:11:17
They don't have to support the fork. They have to release the coins they don't support though because they ARE NOT THEIRS. Dude are you a fully functioning person? How can you not understand the idea of fucking property and theft
Coinbase doesn't get to decide a fork isn't happening. They just steal the fucking coins. Not sure how this is hard to understand. Those coins still exist whether or not Coinbase gives them to you and they are not theirs to keep
It's not about me. I split my own coins. It's about noobs who we as a community should protect because it increases our fucking equity which is the entire point of buying BTC for almost everyone. I honestly don't understand how fucking stupid your viewpoint is. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:15:43
Death of culture
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:08:18
This type of branding in a a field that requires a high intellectual cost of entry but is also looking for mass adoption DEFINITELY hurts the crypto space. It's common sense to anyone who understand marketing and how humans interact with and around new systems they are thinking about getting in to but don't know where to start
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:35:20
Yeah this guys is right. They did take an irrelevant level of action! Give them credit!
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:55:03

Consistent price swap between 3k and 9k?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:35:04
Yes. You own a certain amount of bitcoin. Say you own half a bitcoin and bitcoin is worth 10. Your value is 5k. It goes to 15,000 now your value is 7,500. Regardless of where it is stored
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:55:05
They don't offer much more utility than BTC if you're using segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:01:18
Yeah it means you lose 100% because you never cash out. That means each time you buy you're actually creating "dead coins". It is just all around bad mentality
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:50:34
He left his cold storage out on his table in his home for a single day. It's not that careless. Almost every holder has done something similar. None of the money has been taken from the account he just can't access it. He even had a back up. He secured his better than 2/3 of this sub at least

@_date: 2017-12-20 05:25:41
No one is using segwit wallets
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:19:52
Cause it was the only food Mike could sneak her for awhile she didn't know much else.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:29:54
Yeah so basically you don't want adoption to happen because for people who just setting a wallet up is difficult if things run the way you think is acceptable they basically get shafted. Cool. Like I said I did split my own coins but your point of view is fucking stupid and counter productive to literally everything
It's also the financial equivalent of victim blaming. There is literally no reason to try to justify what would be the illegal holdings of someones funds in any regulated market unless you're some dumb ass shill
When I deposit money into a bank I know exactly what happens and how the merger of different bank types being legal has changed what happens. But They don't keep my money when I go to withdraw and they don't hide the interest I make on investments or high yielding accounts so I can't even see it while saying " we will allow you to have this in 6 months" That only happens when I enter into a contract that states the funds will remain held for a certain amount of time. It does ruffle my feathers youre right Glass-Steagall is fucking evil. Anyone with a fucking brain knows that. My money is also FDIC insured and safe in a bank where they have fraud protection. This is literally nothing like a bank, hence why you suggest not keeping coins there. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:53:58

Bitcoin is absolutely not beyond that. Blockchain is beyond that. Bitcoin, while not having a solitary owner still suffers all the same implications. You're so wrong it is ridiculous
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:12:19
I apologize that I turn to an aggressive tone so easily. You are right to criticize that. Even though I don't support the fleecing of bitcoin noobs I am also a fallible human in other ways
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:43:29
No I think they shouldn't HOLD YOUR FUCKING MONEY AND NOT LET YOU WITHDRAW IT. WOW YOU'RE A COMPLETE FUCKING MORON. Your viewpoint isn't just wrong it literally has zero validity. There is no reason at all to accept what you're defending. There is literally no reason they should allowed to hold peoples money like that. None. Accepting that from a private institution this early in the crypto expansion sets a bad precedent and leads to bad systems as standards. Get good scrub because right now you're negatively effecting the crypto space and its future with your stupidity. 
Lol youre a racism denier too.

Most people secure there coins MUCH MUCH MUCH worse than this. You really have no idea I guess.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:45:33
Yeah that is dumb I agree.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:04:33
No I wanted to sell at 11,000 and it didn't let me until 9,900. I Bought back at 9k like I planned to, but I would have made the trade more than  60% more profitable. It's not being "butthurt" when it alters your value by thousands of dollars at a time.
You're just apathetic because you weren't planning to make a trade at this point. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:27:11
It will only hit 5,800 at the lowest this time
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:08:42
No it means they hold 55k in Bitcoin that hasn't already been split. Not that they have only 55k in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:19:47
It says "a way to send Bitcoin" not BCH and then the fine print says BCH by default. It's a little off

Wait are you sarcastically implying you cash out Bitcoin to a fiat currency? Lol BOO this man!

It won't if you just hodl both coins. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:22:59

Typically it's a change in the way the blockchain operates at some level that forces it to branch in two directions. Now I'm not the best to talk to on technical analysis of blockchain tech. I'm actually trying to find someone who is that can help me navigate this world a little more confidently too
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:12:18
So they ARE the same thing. It's longest valid chain or most proof of work because not having the most proof immediately makes it not valid. There is no difference. Longest valid chain is just a befuddled way of saying it

16% so far. Maybe it hits 20%

Yup anyone who doesn't think this way is just a fanboy. You don't get into crypto to be a fanboy. There are movies and games for that.

That's how you play the game, nice work

More like coinbases KEPT all the split coins.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:00:54
There was nothing to panic over. Even if I supported BCH I still wouldn't have sold my BTC and would still have bought in the dip. Was an obvious orchestrated pump. Bet they made tons of money though, and I bet some of those bitcoin cash supporters bought back during the dip of BTC too :)
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:26:44
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:19:38
I'm not from Russia. Lol I'm not anti bitcoin. I bought more in the dip and plan to hodl
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:38:16
No but there was clear market manipulation this weekend. BCH didn't go up naturally. Look at the buy and sell orders and how shit went down. If this was any other market  everyone involved would be fucking DONE
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:48:37
Lol I think you're right
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:48:41
Fucked up.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:11:55
Yeah they fucked up me getting an 18% increase in the amount of BTC I have. Are there any good exchanges that down go down during dips? They have stopped working for hours for me every time I try to sell. Over all it has cost me about a total of over 100% of my portfolio
I try to buy low and sell high but the fucking website always goes down
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:07:44
Kraken is so buggy that I would suggest it to literally no one
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:10:05
Do they service US?
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:54:51
When someone just can't HODL on any longer?
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:05:58
If it doesn't have the most proof of work it is not valid. So it being longer isn't relevant. He said longest "valid" chain.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:09:36
I tried to sell at 10,868. The fucking GDAX went down for 4 fucking hours. Ended up Selling at 9,985 and buying at just over 9,100. Should have been twice as good though. Utter fucking bullshit
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:29:41
Green Address light wallet. Whatever the current version is. I don't have the wallet on here but I can get the hash or sending address after. My guess is because I set the fee to 10% manually it just didn't get picked up by anyone and that transactions that small with reasonably set fees are not really supported at the moment. Along with the fact there is a backlog making it less likely
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:22:06
I've never looked for a tran ID before. Do you mean the hashcode?
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:14:01
I tried to sell at 11k and I'd have bough back at 9. Would have been an amazing trade but fuck gdax.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:15:33
I don't think it will have as big of an impact as people think. It was pretty obvious to me, and I am as tech challenged as they come that one couldn't need to purchase a whole bitcoin at a time or it would be a complete failure of a system.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:30:14
Whats the value of purchasing it if you NEVER cash out, and when better to cash than when bulling?
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:41:46
Well someone clearly manipulated the market this weekend. If you look at the buy and sell orders it wasn't us normal users making it swing that much. The market was manipulated in a way that would be highly illegal in any market with over sight. I didn't believe any of this conspiracy bullshit before but after that, and literally seeing the downvote bots in effect something is definitely going on. What exactly might not be clear.
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:59:53
How far do you think? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:56:59
Yeah if you're that new to bitcoin I agree with the other responder. Look into more before you purchase it. Especially the security aspect.
You don't really want to keep 8k on an exchange you aren't actively trading.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:35:41
I haven't seen one for over .07%. You can find checking accounts that high with less fees and restrictions. Saving accounts are literally fucking pointless. Not sure why I am getting down voted they serve literally no purpose. There is no niche for them anymore. You either want a bond or you want an checking account where you earn interest.
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:52:22
Unless it hits a milly buy 2020

Agreed. This sub is almost 1/3 shitpost about the new high every day
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:48:51
But Bitcoin functions separately than services like these do. I'm not sure it's "bubble" bursting has the same likelihood overall.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:30:24
Whats the value of purchasing it if you NEVER cash out, and when better to cash than when bulling?
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:18:52
What the fuck dude? This isn't FUD this actually happened, and I sent it DAYS before the network slowed.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:21:07
With the blockchain? It's not anonymous it is an open ledger.
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:43:39
It's blockchain so whoever has the most proof of work is Bitcoin. That's literally how the tech works. I'm on the core side. I'm just saying.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:16:39
No even if they were holding 5 million it could still be 55k in BCH that they have now. I'm not saying that is the case but your ignoring the fact that money is constantly taken off and most people sent their Bitcoin somewhere else and split their coins before sending it back.
What Coinbase holds personally we have no idea or what they did with it. They could have 0 BCH right now.

Hope you also bought Litecoin when it hit the 40's one of the times recently.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:43:08
No  a lot of people are actually saying it's possible that BCH benefits from the upcoming 2x fork
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:17:54
Your new account reminds me of trolls
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:41:01
Weird I noticed the same thing.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:45:18
All these gifs just circulate all the crypto subs
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:24:18
This is just a normal dip for BTC. It hasn't even hit 20% dip yet. There is no attack. BCH will drop in two weeks after climbing a little more
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:03:02
This post already happened right after the dip. It was a shitpost then. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 04:55:29
There should be no switching. They should be the only new addresses being formed. Any new address should automatically be using segwit.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:23:27
Oh wow that's shady and is keeping the value of BCH higher than it should be
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:09:54
Tether is going to get shut down eventually anyway
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:35:26
Why though? And how the fuck do you have other cryptos, as in plural, but no Bitcoin? That seems kind of weird. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:33:14
I don't really care about the dollar. 
What I care about is bitcoin being a service where I can reliably send one. That's why I don't get all the hate and accusations of russian trolldom. I just want to see bitcoin perfected. It's ability to be used as a real currency will only increase it's value. Also I am relatively new to bitcoin. This is a greenaddress wallet that I had like 1.10 left in. or .12387mbtc
You mean the input address or the output? Though I only see a point in sharing if it expands on the discussion
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:02:16
same thing
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:01:50
Check only to buy with buy. :)
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:26:03
How likely is bitcoin to crash big after the fork?
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:45:17
If the clone is better, and I'm not saying any have been yet. Then only complete, and I mean complete, morons won't support it. So this post seems dumbish
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:51:44
Buy less than a full coin or a piece at a time.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:24:38
There is literally 0 chance that Silk Road was launched two years after Bitcoin, simply to disgrace it. The Silk Road was bigger than Bitcoin for quite awhile. You didn't even need to use crypto's for the stuff at that point.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:44:01
Oh look another shit post
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:41:12
No it isn't. Bitcoin.org is
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:10:23
They are supporting Bcash? Since when?
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:01:12
Having financial software used for trading that collapses due to a volatile moment is like having a PS4 that only plays cutscenes
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:48:44
Usually what I do. I thought I'd switch it up this time.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:33:22
Yeah if it jumps below 6k I'm putting most of my investment $'s for the month into it.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:14:38
Yeah I'm not saying it's true. I was just saying the 55k in user funds is possible for other reasons. Probably unlikely.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:41:15
Of course it is the only responsible thing to do. It doesn't mean you can't have a favorite in the fight for idealistic reasons. That's the difference between it being an investment and a speculation. Can also be both.
I'm not refusing anything. You don't know how I feel about anything. Turn off your gaslight and stop making assumptions
To quote another poster from another thread "Bitcoin doesn't exist with decentralisation. Transaction fees matter, but topology is everything (EVERYTHING). Before you buy BCH, ask yourself if in 10 years time people are going to trust a coin backed by nodes that can only be run by people who own data centres."
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:56:17
Bitcoin futures announced and Square announced accepting them.
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:50:05
Yeah but it has no benefits over a safe bolted into your foundation either.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:38:50
It's not the size doubling that leads to centralization, and there is no way you don't know that and also what I meant lol.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:06:01
Exactly you can't have trading platforms that can't handle periods of volatility.
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:37:43
It's moved this much every couple weeks. It's not a big deal. Just 1000.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:23:14
Not necessarily.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:26:52
It's not confirmed I can see that in the sending wallet. I sent it last thursday. So it had an entire 48 hours before the network slowed "2017-11-09T11:28:40.000Z"
I'm not bashing bitcoin. I'm just saying that at some point this can't be a thing if we want bitcoin to remain king of the currencies as I as a Hodler hope it does
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:53:05
This. Liquidate all your assets and let that shit ride.
You gotta risk it if you wanna get the biscuit
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:08:32
If they are trying to become regulated and work with governments as much as they claim they are trying then the first step is to stay solvent so this is actually unlikely.
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:35:07
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:32:39
It has gone up and down from $300 for six months. I dont think that can be predicted.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:32:46
Back over 7k.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:12:34
I'm not upset when bitcoin cash rises. I'm upset that when you look at the buy and sell orders it was due to market manipulation that is 100% and definite. On such a scale that people would be imprisoned for decades over it in any other market. Also if the strongest crypto can experience a 30% dip on the whims of those trying to manipulate this unregulated market then cryptos as a whole have a serious hurdle to tackle before mass adoption is even really possible. Let Bitcoin Cash rise. I'd even be willing to say it could be the better currency even though I don't think it is. But let it do it ethically and naturally. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:20:08
I sent it to coinbase, and it showed up as pending and now has been dropped completely.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:46:34
It's not coordinated. It's just people only care about the money when putting their money on something....
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:38:34
Whoever has more proof of work is Bitcoin. Isn't that how blockchain works?
Lulz here goes
@_date: 2017-11-09 07:48:41
You have the keys so you can split them after.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:29:31
Being against centralized mining is not five year old logic. It's basically believing in why Bitcoin was created. there is literally no reason to try to reason with you. Your comment had no thought or logic either so hello Mr.Pot.
I agree this isn't currently an attack. It's the market regulating after a big spike. Like it always does. It might go back to 5,800 then back up to 6,500 where it will flat line basically for a little bit before it climbs again, but this will not be a tailspin of doom and BCH will not take over. It will rise about 200 more and then plummet by Christmas
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:02:33
Your article is far too aggressive. No one who doesn't agree with it already would listen. It's good but not as a persuasive piece
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:10:48
Having a "free market" is not possible. Regulations protect general consumers from whales who would otherwise have full control over the market. Your perception is so fucking limited. Regulations don't need to give them control just give them authority to prosecute those who try to fuck people
@_date: 2018-02-19 23:44:53
Oh because we still use Netscape to get on the internet right?
The first social media site is still the standard right?
Bitcoin is already only the best crypto in name notoriety and not in any other way
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:12:36
It wasn't predicted due to volatility is was predicted because those records were set by unsustainable means of companies buying back their own shares that they had sold off more of. Most of the growth was basically falsified
@_date: 2018-02-16 05:01:05
I think you may be missing the point.
@_date: 2018-02-16 05:05:51
You won't make you rich if you HODL til you're dead though.
@_date: 2018-02-19 23:45:56
It's inferior tech to like 15 coins that are already out in every conceivable way. The first to get big in all industries no longer exist. How is your Netscape or AOL accounts doing? The only thing Bitcoin has for it is brand recognition and that will not carry it to the end. It WILL be replaced
@_date: 2018-02-19 22:25:17
So if the price drops then you don't actually lose anything? When Bitcoin is replaced by a better crypto, which will definitely happen at some point, and you're still HODLing it won't matter because you don't actually lose anything by the price dropping using your logic
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:37:42
That's still profiting........ If the initial value you put in goes up and it becomes usable as an actual currency you still invested
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:10:01
Why regulating it should only make it stronger for the general consumer
@_date: 2018-02-20 05:09:42
You're being willfully ignorant about how markets changing almost never have the same front runner after mass adoption or peak market. Keep dreaming broski. Bitcoin is literally the test run. It will not be the primary.
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:39:37
Bitcoin is absolutely for speculating. "Investing" in it means you're literally putting money in because you believe in the technology. That's great and very altruistic, but if you are doing it to make money than you are speculating and if you say you aren't, it's just a self delusion
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:41:57
Water is absolutely a product if you mean clean water. You pay for it either in cash or taxes. Are you legitimately fucking stupid? Just because you can gather your own, like tobacco, doesn't mean that it's not a product, just like a bag of roll your own tobacco is DEFINITELY a product. So it water if you buy it. Resources, when sold, are products. You need some time learning how logical reasoning works.
Honestly this is literally the dumbest fucking comment I have ever responded to. 
Edit: I honestly can't believe I responded to such and obviously wrong and fucking stupid comment
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:58:41
I am comparing them to exactly that. They are just in the stages where they are still pushing forward and brand recognition is carrying them. They will eventually be replaced for the same reasons by something else that becomes the standard. This happens in almost every single market eventually.
@_date: 2018-02-16 05:06:49
Your name checks out.
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:09:56
All major currencies? Now gold is something else entirely. So maybe that will happen to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-04 05:53:11
This one isn't even new. It existed before the last dip with the same numbers
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:08:57
If it isn't a product than you can't buy any.
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:54:17
Yeah, the conspiracy will be found in the futures markets and timed pump and dumps.
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:19:21
Speculating is any calculated gamble. Buy BTC and HODL is still speculating it is just doing it on a Macro level. You don't secure your future UNLESS you eventually profit. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:48:50
They don't 5x their money daily. They add a % daily after every day is averaged together.
Don't call someone a dumbass because you did something that is improbable 1 times.
@_date: 2018-02-14 06:20:34
There is literally no such thing as a "free" market. In an unregulated market established wealth rules with a lot more control than any government could in a regulated one. There has to be a balance to come anywhere near something that can work. You can't have a completely utilitarian or deontological view point about it 
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:59:00
Netscape and AOL weren't browsers. They HAD browsers. Mozilla is not top dog. You are the one who should try again
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:37:53
It's no more gambling than just buying and holding as long as you wait for the normal fluctuations, which WILL occur. You just have to make sure the fluctuation is more then the fee and go from there. I would always hold SOME incase it skyrockets without many big dips again, but its not really any more gambling than investing in crypto period since thats speculation and not really investing anyway
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:10:08
I don't care about down votes.
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:53:31
Yeah but they can buy crypto, as they inflate the price, hedge bets against it in the futures markets and then pull out of the crypto space for a profit and win in the futures markets too. Hurting crypto.
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:17:39
It's the opposite of what it is actually about. It's not about serving those well off more than they were already serviced.
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:52:32
Yeah they probably all are, while they bet on the futures markets that the price will dip, and once they pump the market up they pull out,  and win on both bets.
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:58:11
Why haven't they put it in my account is what I want to know? I thought that was supposed to happen.
@_date: 2018-02-10 14:53:07
So like any market?
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:12:41
If Amazon starts accepting Bitcoin it will increase the price and keep it elevated simply based off the fact it opens up TONS of vendors and not just that but easy to use vendors making Bitcoin far more acceptable in how approachable it is. Without something like this there are entire demographics that will die without considering adopting it.
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:14:11
The only reason they talk about it in relation to the dollar or fiat is because those are easy to spend so you would need to transfer to use for the most part. Also they are reference points that anyone you talk to will understand
