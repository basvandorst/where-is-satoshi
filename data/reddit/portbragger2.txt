"Precious" metal have their value only out of mystical reason.
Gold is of no use in the industry as a metal (apart from questionable improvement of standard electrical copper contacts).
If the gold mines would run dry tomorrow. Nothing would happen.
If copper or zinc would run dry tomorrow we would have a industrial/economical crisis with copper/zinc prices skyrocketing because of the "supply shock" mechanism. Because THOSE metals actually have use.
That can be easily translated to BTC.
BTC has a higher value than other equal tech cryptos at this moment in time because of peoples EMOTIONS (mystical reason).
I could clone the whole ecosystem of BTC a thousand times
and call them BTC2 , BTC3, ...., BTC999, BTC1000 all of them with the exact same specification and underlying ruleset.
And whoops, look who gets devaluated... BTC ... OF COURSE!
Do you get it now?

It's gone to the ones who were lucky to be aware of Bitcoin.
Which makes a single cryptocurrency that is already almost fully mined and distributed unattractive to the public.
The technology on the other hand, once implemented in a freshly started "semi-official" currency replacement, will help the public to have a much more flexible asset than FIAT or gold.
Which means Bitcoin will eventually lose value and there will be an equilibrium price point of all current cryptocoin which happen to "stay alive" and then there will be a government founded crypto which is WIDELY communicated amongst the public so that everybody can trade in his DOLLAR/EURO at a fair price. 
And not pay ludicrious amounts of money to chinese miners to get a little taste of the crypto world.
BTC... It's not a scam.
But it's nothing more than a field test of crypto currency which will not survive due to obvious distribution imparity.
Or do you think averagely wealthy and the even richer FIAT users will want to get into something that will lose them their position on the table ??? 
How does anybody think the wealthy normies will just throw away their "money" for something that makes them poorer in the end.

Any cryptocurrency is interchangeable with another cryptocurrency of the same technology lying underneath it.
Think about that for a moment.

you seem like a pleasant-natured guy

They can't benefit from it in the long run because there will be a big devaluation of BTC due to the fact that I explained:
No sane wealthy person that doesn't use crypto is going to pump their hard earned money into an asset where they don't gain anything anymore but instead feed the mouths of some lucky or not lucky early adopters.
You see.... it doesn't have to be BTC... it can be ANY new iteration of a properly designed crypto. 
That's what makes single currency so worthless and in case of BTC OVERvalued. 
Maybe the more evenly distributed coin where it is easier to get in at a certain point in the next 3 years will be one of the main crypto assets, but it will certainly not be a completely ill-distributed BTC :)

Did you know that there are even more scarce metals than Silver, Gold or Platin that have a significantly lower "price", "value"...
You can "store" wealth in gold because the only way it gets its value from is by emotional attachment which has developed over the whole history of humankind. Oh dear Lord, how old are you? 
You should really do some history lessons combined with some basic economy lessons.
Your whole attitude shows me you're a tag-along of the BTC hype...
That's what happens when something gets to your head too quickly.
You should shift down one gear and inform yourself about basic economical dependencies before you try to advertise a cryptocurrency that is so far from being adopted by the public like almost no other of the existing shitcoins.
Bitcoin is the real shitcoin.
People will move to coins that they know are not accumulated since 2009 by greedy chinese miners &amp; co. 
Coins like FairCoin, ARK, Monero, IOTA, Ripple, LC, Dash, Stratis will raise in value moderately in the long run. 
While BTC direction is only downwards in the long run.

lol??? don't you read? 
i have my coin since over 2 years 
@_date: 2017-07-21 07:19:30
Could be some government as well... ?!
It's all bad in my eyes.
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:08:43
i have em in a private wallet, i was just very unsure about the date everyone is making such a big deal about. and how to proceed.
for example maybe it could have been the case that it is always a safe bet to sell to watch what happens...

I do, that's why for example stuff lilke FairCoin exists. For the people. Not for some random greedy miners that use BitCoin only as a means to exploit unknowing people who now think it's a good thing to buy one bitcoin for 2500$ when it is obvious that there will be a devaluation.
