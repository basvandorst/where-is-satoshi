I would also add that if Gox legitimately committed fraud (for example, if the "exchange" is actually a ponzi scheme), then you would definitely have grounds for lawsuit.

I don't think so. Regular short selling requires you to own the underlying asset that you short (borrow and sell). Naked short selling is where you borrow and sell an asset that you don't own.

Great explanation. Thanks. I still think that the difference in price (between Gox and another exchange) of one BTC in USD has to be the net effect of the "real value of BTC" and the credit risk that you won't get any BTC or USD out of Gox.
Are we saying the same thing at this point or am I still missing that last part?

You always have the option to not invest. People seem to forget that.

@_date: 2014-03-21 14:04:08
Interesting thought, but I think they owe people Bitcoins, not dollars.  So, even if the dollar value of a Bitcoin is higher today, they still owe people the same number of Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-03-13 18:59:32
Although I agree that naked short selling isn't a great practice (especially in an unregulated environment like a Bitcoin exchange), you are absolutely wrong that it is "fraud and counterfeiting".  Naked short selling is a loan plus short selling.  The seller borrows an asset from the agent and then sells it into the marketplace with the promise to return it at some future point (by buying it back).  It's a contractual agreement, no different than any other agreement.

Given your initial statement (which includes the idea of loans), your notion that 2008 wouldn't have happened in a Bitcoin world isn't valid.
Bitcoin can change the world in a positive way, but it doesn't change the human quality of greed.  Financial crises will occur whether or not Bitcoin exists, because there will always be people trying to make money (and most of those people will do it within the rules of the system).
I would tell your friend that lack of regulation isn't the problem, but a lack of negative consequences for those causing the problem is the issue (the bailout of banks that made bad loans is the prime example, but there are lots of examples - homeowners who lied about income and stayed in their homea for years without making payments is also a bailout of sorts).

Buy on Gox
Sell elsewhere
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:07:06
So to clarify your first point (I want to make sure I understand you), 1 BTC at Gox used to be the same as 1 BTC anywhere else because you could easily transfer BTC in/out of Gox.  However, USD at Gox was effectively worth less than USD anywhere else because you could not transfer USD in/out of Gox easily.  The result of this was that the price of BTC at Gox in USD was higher than at other exchanges.  Correct?
I'm not getting the second half of your second point.  Everything (USD and BTC) has a spread (priced at a discount) at Gox now because of the overall liquidity issue.  The discount on USD pushes the price of BTC up (all else equal), but that is offset by the substantial discount on BTC.
Can you elaborate on your last sentence:
"So the difference actually represents the difference in credit risk between holding BTC in Gox and USD in Gox."

No.  The vast majority of the current financial system operates within the laws/rules/regulations given to it.  There is nothing "crooked" about operating within the rules of the game.
The pro-Bitcoin argument should be that the current "rules of the game" are not sustainable (with bubbles of all sorts, and a widening wealth gap) and should be changed.  Bitcoin offers "new rules", to some degree.
@_date: 2014-01-22 21:52:52
When they don't operate within the regulations, they should be punished.  I completely agree with you.
As I said earlier in the thread, the biggest problem is a lack of negative consequences for those who act unethically/illegally.
I still maintain, however, that there is nothing inherently "crooked" about most participants in financial markets, including large institutions.  No one is setting up shop with the main goal of manipulating LIBOR.

A business (continuing the sandwich shop example) is established to make money by selling sandwiches, not to speculate on investments/currencies or promote the acceptance of Bitcoin.
There is a lot of risk for a business to accept Bitcoin over fiat money because of price volatility.  It's easy to envision more and more businesses accepting Bitcoin in today's environment when the price is increasing, but what if it was the other way around?  Price stability is key.

The real economic value of Bitcoin is as a means of transaction.  So, the fundamental value of Bitcoin (not the market value, as market value can diverge from fundamental value due to differences in expectations/motives of market participants) will increase as it is adopted as a means of transaction.  The more businesses that accept Bitcoin for goods and services, the more value it has.

You are mistaking the brand (Bitcoin) for the technology (cryptocurrency).  Cryptocurrency is more analogous to the internet.  Bitcoin is analagous to an internet company (will it be Altavista or Google?).
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:24:48
It would work the same as cash.  You would borrow some amount of Bitcoin and promise to pay back another amount of Bitcoin in the future.  Because inflation is part of interest rates, interest rates for Bitcoin would be lower (negative in certain circumstances?), but the fundamental concept of borrowing wouldn't change.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:36:15
But what is anyone's incentive to start a business if there is no profit?  That's what business is...an attempt to make profit.  If you ("you" being a generalization here) don't want to invest in something profitable, then potentially profitable businesses will never get funded.  Then the potential businesses that never got funded will never hire potential employees, and no one will have a job (income) to fund these unprofitable "things you want to see succeed".
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:09:06
A business is willing to discount a product today because they expect the value of the Bitcoin to increase relative to dollars.
For example...
Assume a single Bitcoin is worth $1000.
Now assume the bill for my meal is $1100 (that's a pretty big meal!).
If the restaurant owner believes that in the future, a Bitcoin will be worth more than $1000, then he may be willing to charge me only 1 Bitcoin today (the equivalent of $1000) for that $1100 meal.
A week from now, if 1 Bitcoin is worth $1200, then the restaurant owner still has 1 Bitcoin (now worth $1200, which is more than the original $1100 he would have gotten for the meal)...PLUS...as a consumer I feel great because I got a "discount" (in dollar terms) on last week's meal.
Make sense?  The argument against this is that if a Bitcoin is expected to increase in value, why would I ever pay 1 Bitcoin for that meal?  I should just pay the $1100 now and save the Bitcoin, as it would be worth $1200 next week.  I don't know what the "correct answer" is, but this is the logic.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:24:15
Hypothetically, countries can do this even without Bitcoin simply by printing more money (thereby creating inflation in their currency).  If you have fixed-rate debt denominated in a certain currency, inflation erodes the relative size of that debt.  The problem with this is that hyperinflation would kill the local economy and not be good for said country.
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:24:14
But with fiat, the long-term trend is inflationary, which reduces debt burden over time.  With a deflationary currency, taking on long-term debt (that is denominated in the same, deflationary currency) doesn't make as much economic sense.
World economics would have to change in order to support a large-scale, deflationary currency.

@_date: 2013-12-12 20:54:04
That's the explanation.  The internet was once a new technology that created opportunities, opened markets, spurred the rise and fall of lots of businesses, etc.  It changed the world.
Cryptocurrency has the potential to do the same.

I'm not saying that no one will ever convert to fiat, but I'm saying that if enough transactions can be done with cryptocurrency, it could become easier for the business to just keep the cryptocurrency they receive from transactions and use it to fund their business operations.  The big caveat to this is that the currency would need to have a stable value.  I agree that businesses are not built to speculate on the currency risk of transactions, they are built to do business.

This.  If cryptocurrency gets big enough, either current banks will begin to participate in it, or new banks that do will replace them.  Either way, institutions have to get involved in order to legitimize Bitcoin on a large scale.

Informally, a store of wealth means that if something really bad happens (a world war, for example), the object in question will still be valued by people (gold is a time-tested store of wealth).
I don't think Bitcoin's deflationary nature is what makes it a potential store of wealth, but I don't disagree that it could be a store of wealth.  The network effects of Bitcoin's usage as a medium of exchange could lead to it becoming a highly valuable resource.
@_date: 2013-12-12 14:40:44
I like your ideas.  Here's what I can't reconcile.
For someone to use a Bitcoin bank, the individual needs to be able to trust the bank.  This means that it either needs to be a large, well known institution, or some large institution needs to back it (through insurance, guarantee, etc.).  In any case, who is going to provide the insurance?  Keep in mind that many would argue that to rely on a bank/insurer/institution defeats the ideal of decentralization.
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:57:10
I see a lot of bank-haters on Bitcoin forums/Reddit touting cryptocurrency as some kind of savior from the evils of banking.  Regardless of your take on the matter, I think many people are ignoring the fact that, if Bitcoin succeeds in becoming a currency, a banking system for Bitcoin will develop.  Banks will lend in Bitcoin, people will borrow in Bitcoin, and life will go on.  Bitcoin doesn't equal the end of banking (good or bad).
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:46:47
Can't you just transfer BTC/LTC/etc. somewhere else and withdraw?
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:39:45
On one hand, businesses may sell the Bitcoins that they receive from transactions, which is (in a vacuum) bad for the price.  On the other hand, the network effects that are created as more and more businesses accept Bitcoins (even if they are selling them) are positive for the viability of Bitcoin over the long-run.  If enough businesses accept Bitcoin, then it becomes a more valuable medium of exchange.  This is positive for the price.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:15:08
I don't disagree with you about the causes for animosity, but fundamentally, banks provide a very useful service.  They connect people who have money (savers) to people who want money (borrowers).  They take deposits and make loans.  This is a service that benefits all parties who are involved (obviously, when it is done ethically, intelligently, etc.)
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:01:59
People also seem to think that Bitcoin will spell the end of all banks.  This couldn't be further from the truth.  If Bitcoin becomes a widely accepted medium of exchange, banks would end up treating it just like any other currency.
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:13:58
