PayPal took a $2 fee I think, I bought 100$. Btc
@_date: 2014-12-12 22:45:04
Well it is a lot simpler because its juts buy low and sell high, nothing like dividends and other stuff to worry about. Also easier to keep track of btc news them to keep track of companies and their sectors.

If paypal made a crypto wallet and allowed everyone to use BTC on eBay, I think BTC would break $1000 in a heartbeat

I have a wallet on my iPhone. I think its called bread wallet? Anyways it doesn't use any company, its a proper wallet.

just move all your btc out, give the password and when they returns your btc, transfer that out too

I'll give you $20 for it, I'm in college and don't have to pay for power
@_date: 2014-12-04 05:04:39
I have unlimited free power in my college room, but no miner :(

I found a guy on an online money making forum who was willing to sell for paypal. I might just sign up for coinbase, because I need it to trade anyways.
@_date: 2015-01-08 01:00:04
I just transferred to BITSTAMP to trade it
@_date: 2015-01-04 01:53:17
The display turns red if the price drops, and turns green when it goes up. If the price drops more then 5%, an alarm goes off. You connect it to your wifi and it pulls data from coin desk. Im currently in the process of making a nice "executive" wood housing and using a nicer display. If you guys like it, I may throw it on kickstarter!

How do I withdraw BTC from Bitstamp? I couldn't find the option earlier
@_date: 2015-01-08 02:50:12
Please call it "The Fortune Cookie Wallet" 
@_date: 2015-01-06 00:20:30
seems legit, 8 day old account that only posts negative stuff. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 01:02:18
I have everything on my cold storage wallet, I transferred cuz I wanted to trade it, and now this happened 
@_date: 2015-05-16 14:59:51
He has millions in BTC. He would be hunted if he revealed himself

Says the government that uses violence to try to stop drug use.....
@_date: 2015-07-15 03:00:39
Lol "fraud protection".  Bitcoin is my fraud protection from scummy buyers and eBays shitty policies 
@_date: 2015-07-10 18:08:12
Fuck the roof, we're headed towards low orbit
@_date: 2015-04-26 16:21:11
and then paypal takes a small percent, so out of every 5 dollar sale you make 3.85 about

Use google adsense to try to fund some of the donations
