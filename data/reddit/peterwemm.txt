Yes.. if your current rate is 1 block every 6 months, then that's the rate you'll do until the next difficulty adjustment.  Even then, the amount of difficulty adjustment is capped, so if you were a small operator and the last guy standing it'll take years to be up to 25 btc / 10 minutes. This is one of the anti-fork mechanisms.
But yes, a large portion of miners stopping is a very bad thing. 
(However, if you were the last miner standing you might as well hard fork anyway and reset the difficulty.  The trick would be convincing everyone else to sign on.)

Exactly.  It's a quirk of the p2pool system but not one that is a cause for concern.
With p2pool you're mining against a tiny difficulty in order to establish what proportion of the work is being done by who.
These tiny difficulty pool-blocks are very fast moving so there's a higher stale rate. If you can mine with a lower stale rate than the pool as a whole, then you are actually ahead.  That's your goal - be same or less than the overall pool stale stale/doa rate.
Don't worry, If one of these tiny blocks is ALSO a valid bitcoin block, then the pool then it is submitted and the pool members are paid.

The kicker is all those "suspicious activity" and transaction report filings have a filing fee that somebody has to pay.  If the bank suspects they may have to do a lot of filings for you, they won't go near you.  And if you have an account that starts to accumulate filing fees, they drop you.

The core issue is "control".
You often see people writing about how its the difference between storing *your money* in their bank vs being your own bank etc, but if you think like that then they've already got you right where they want you.
The reality is, money isn't yours.  It's their money.  They created it.  They control it.  What really matters is debt, obligations, credit, wealth, collateral, etc.  The fact that you're holding some of their money is just lubrication for the machinery.
If you deposit a chunk of cash in a bank, you might think that you're doing the bank a favor.  In reality, it is almost the opposite.  What you're actually doing is returning their money to them, and creating a debt/obligation from them to you.  No for-profit entity likes having debts on the books.  Besides, why would they want money back when they can just create more?  That is, so long as they comply with industry guidelines about ratios of debt to credit, asset reserves etc.  When they lend somebody money, it creates a debt, which be accounted for as an asset (somebody owes you something), which can be collateralized, which then improves the asset/liability ratio, which means they can have more money created by their reserve bank for them.
And that's what it is all really about these days.  They take a slice of every operation/transfer/etc.   The more money they create, the more debt they create for you, the more they can collateralize, which feeds back to creating more money - and the more opportunities to exploit.  This is transferring wealth from you to them.  It's a feedback loop.
On the flip side, there is bitcoin.  All this goes away and its back to the banking stone age. Of course they hate it.
And yes, I know this reads like tinfoil hat material, and I know I grossly oversimplified and probably got a bunch of details wrong, but the general gist stands - that they operate a feedback loop and use the system to screw us at every iteration.  And that bitcoin ruins that game.
I encourage you to read more.  The banking system really is rigged and not in your favor.

If you're in the US and the card has a PIN then you can go for a fairly high fee roundabout way with Walmart -&gt; Moneygram -&gt; ZipZap -&gt; BitInstant.  Fees will be about:  $4 for walmart. $3.95 for zipzap. 4% for bitinstant.  But Walmart will use a *PIN* based visa debit card.  Other moneygram agents take cash only.
If you can take cash out of the card then your options open up quite a bit.  If you're prepared to wear the steep conversion overheads of moneygram / zipzap / bitinstant then its an option.
Do be aware that moneygram will still require your identity (name/address/phone/etc) if its more than a trivial amount of cash.  Its far from anonymous if that's the aim of the exercise.

GPU mining is wonderful when its running on somebody else's power :)
Seriously though..  you might be better off exchanging cash for a few bitcoins to mess around with if you're testing the water.  There's lots of ways, all with pros and cons.  eg: bitinstant is fast but has some pretty significant overheads.  Something like coinbase is cheap but takes a while.  Or you can use an online exchange (MtGox and friends).  There's local person to person meet/exchange sites (can be risky and depends on how much you value your time).
Mining your own coins takes a while unless you have very high end hardware.  Joining a mining pool (btcguild, deepbit, and many, many others) where you get a proportional share of the pool's generated coins is probably the path of least resistance if you're looking to get started with mining.
@_date: 2015-03-21 22:07:46
The other thing is your wallet contains signing keys, not the actual coins.
Bitcoin works because every single (full) bitcoin client has a copy of the transaction history and verifies signatures.
When a miner finds a mathematical solution to create the next block, they get to create 25 bitcoin in the process as a reward.
From that point on, all bitcoin is transferred by a cryptographic signature.  It's strictly a pass-it-on system.  Your wallet contains keys to pass it on to the next person.

Part of the problem, and why this is even an issue at all is that the US population at large is frighteningly illiterate when it comes to decimals.
Case in point: Fuel prices.  People in the US see "3.79" as $3 and 79 cents, not 3.79 dollars.  This leads to all sorts of madness like fuel prices of "3.79 9/10" per gallon on signs instead of 3.799/gallon.  There must be some significant portion of the US population that would think of it as "$3 and 799 cents" or would be put off by it somehow as it's outside their comfort zone.
I realize of course that it started with fractional pricing when it was below $1, and things like "79 9/10 cents" per gallon took hold. 
Then there's the madness "Credit card surcharge 0.06 cents/gallon" when they actually mean "$0.06/gallon" or "6 cents/gallon".
This insanity has even made it to infamous cases like Verizon cell phone data charges.
However.  In spite of the tragic stage of numeracy in the US, I really don't think uBTC/mBTC/etc will be needed, nor catch on.
The kinds of people who will be the early adopters won't have problems with the btc/satoshi split.  By the time it reaches critical mass it'll be so well entrenched that it won't matter.
I think people will be more comfortable thinking of 0.001 btc = 100k satoshi and going from there.
In any case, We've got a long way to go before we really get away from generally thinking in terms of fiat equivalent value.  I think that's a far bigger problem that's more worthy of worrying about.

It's not about when you did the transaction, but rather when you generated the address you sent the BTC to.
If you sent BTC to an address that was generated with a weak(or broken) private key then your phone doesn't even have to be involved.
What about backups?  Is there any chance there's a backup of your wallet around that got stolen?  Remember, it's the private key from when the address was generated that matters.
If somebody can guess/derive/steal private keys they can just sign a transaction to send your money elsewhere based on public blockchain info.

Not 500, but it's still just about as bad:
bytes = inputs * 148 + outputs * 34 + 10

(I know, it's 147-149 bytes per input, but it's close enough)
@_date: 2013-05-06 22:20:23
Yes, but there is a "gotcha".  Addresses are not like bank accounts at all and they do not have balances.  Wallets have balances, addresses do not.
Background: A transaction has inputs and outputs.  Each input is a previous transaction's output.  The bitcoin network only keeps track of the "spent" or "not spent" state. Making a transaction spends it all and you're actually making a transaction that sends the desired amount to somebody and sending the "change" back to an address that belongs to you.  The original output is 100% consumed in the process.
A wallet keeps track of all of this.  It keeps the private key that is used to securely sign a transaction that goes with spending a previous output.  It keeps track of all of the unspent outputs you've received and tells you the "balance" of them.
If you think of bitcoin / addresses / wallets like a bank account, you'll get burned sooner or later.
Think of it more like a physical wallet that contains a whole pile of signed notes for various amounts.  The physical wallet analogy doesn't quite work though.. your wallet actually contains the secret signatures that correspond to the notes that were paid to you in the public journal.
Suppose you received a 10 bitcoin payment and you wanted to pay sombody 0.5 bitcoin.  You are effectively using the secret key corresponding to the 10 bitcoin to make a signed transaction to say "I am consuming this 10 btc payment and creating a 0.5 btc payment to some_address and 9.5 btc to another_address".  And then publishing it.  ("another_address" is one of yours, silently, behind the scenes.)  The network validates it, makes sure the signatures are correct and that it hasn't been spent already, that it adds up etc.  Once the network decides "Yep, that's totally legit!" your 0.5 bitcoin recipient now has something to spend, and you have a 9.5 bitcoin output ready to spend against.
The difference between addresses, accounts, balances, bank accounts and how change works is vitally important if you're going to do the paper wallet thing.  If you don't understand how change is handled you can really screw yourself.

It wasn't decided on IRC or reddit or even bitcointalk.  The devs moved back to good old-fashioned email lists a few months back (to try and get a handle on the poor signal-to-noise ratio) alongside the usual github tools.

The ephemeral nature of IRC and forums makes them bad places for keeping persistent records of input over changes like this.

Suppose a super-pool had 80% of the global hash power and the following happened (simplified skipping some of the finer points):
Person X pays 10000BTC to person Y, eg: an exchange.    Person X ALSO creates a double spend so the same coins go to to another account they control.
The network correctly rejects this, and after 6 confirmations the person cashes out at the exchange.
Now, person X colludes with the superpool.  Superpool abandons the chain that gave 6 confirmations to the exchange, and winds back to the block that the double-spend happened.. and then they switch which transaction was double-spent and start mining a new chain based on the alternative outcome of the double-spend.
For every block the rest of the world produced, this superpool could produce 3.  After the main chain produced 4 blocks, the superpool would have produced 12 blocks of alternative history.  The original 6 confirmations, plus 4 more legitimate main chain blocks would be outrun by the 12 blocks the superpool produced.
The network would converge on the new "alternate" chain and history would be retroactively changed.  The exchange that accepted the 6 confirmation cash-out is screwed because the confirmations are gone.
Person X now sends 1000 BTC to the superpool operator as a thank you.
Something along these lines happened to OKPAY in the recent fork incident.  A person took advantage knowing the confirmations were going to go away and did a $10000 double spend against them to prove a point.
And yes, I know I've over simplified.
@_date: 2013-05-27 13:52:22
Here are the facts:
What is killing you is the 148 bytes per input.  They add up to a large transaction fast.
The network requires a fee.. you can't type 0.. if the total transaction takes more than 10k, or any output is less than 0.01.  If you hit these thresholds then a fee of 0.0005 per kb is nominally required.  However, the *network* will relay the transactions if they have 0.0001/kb or higher, and some miners have lowered their mining minimum fee from 0.0005 to 0.0001 - eg: btcguild. A 0.0001+/kb transaction will likely reach a miner that will mine it.
If you had a coincontrol client and some time you might be able to do some careful aggregation.  You could pair up some larger previous outputs with some smaller inputs to try and vacuum up some of the dust.  10k/148 = 67, so in theory you could take that 0.00999998 and add about 65 or so dust to that and meet the 0.01 output rule and squeak in below the 10k limit.  You could then aggregate them into a "spendable" output.
In theory, you could probably do it with 3 transactions.  First: 0.0445 + 64 x tiniest dust.  Second: 0.009999998 + next 64 x tiniest dust.  Third: all the rest.  That would create three transactions just below 10k, where all outputs were 0.01 or higher.. for no fees (assuming the coin age rules were met).
The obvious catch is the coin control patches are not part of the mainline client (but they are quite functional, see the pull request), blockchain.info doesn't use them anyway (although you could export the wallet and import them into a coincontrol client), and this is a lot of hassle for what's currently about $9 or so.
Disclaimer: I haven't had my morning coffee yet, my math could be off.
@_date: 2013-04-01 23:33:28
Yep, it would have to be a 100% participation protocol change as it's a hard fork event.  eg: if the theft happened and was mined, we'd need to add a way to retroactively reverse a mined and confirmed transaction.  Either rewind the blockchain and undo everyone else's confirmations, or add a "reverse" event.  Remember, new clients start at block  and need to be able to make sense of what happened.  The "ignore tx" would have to go into the blockchain so that some random person's client can validate the double-spend we introduced.
I refer you to  as an indication on how quickly people upgrade.
@_date: 2013-05-27 14:29:51
Yeah its likely he's exceeded 10k transaction size by the sound of it, which means the 0.0001 x size_in_kb fee is absolutely required by the network.  0.0002 will just get dropped as a note in people's debug.log files.
If this is the case, it will never confirm because it will never even reach a miner.  He might as well use pywallet to delete the pending transaction from his wallet and try again.
A txid would be helpful.
@_date: 2013-11-02 18:42:37
Don't think of addresses as an account or a balance.  You should think of bitcoin using the wallet metaphor - ie: a collection of cash/notes of set values.
When you buy something with cash, you get out enough notes/coins to pay, and you get change.
That's precisely what happens here.  You are making a transaction that consumes a number of "notes" that you have as inputs, sending an amount to the recipient and the balance is sent back to you as a new note for the change.
Inputs are the addresses/unspent amounts that you have keys for.  Outputs are where you are sending it to.  The bitcoin system doesn't track balances - only a single "spent" or "not spent" state.  There are no partial spends.
Bitcoin doesn't have balances or accounts like a bank or paypal etc.  Your wallet software shows you a balance of "unspent" things for your convenience.
@_date: 2013-09-17 15:42:45
I'm really torn about what to think of this.  On one hand, people are quick to declare that "bitcoin solves everything!" and on the other hand many of the same people run to paypal.  That doesn't solve anything for the people who paid with bitcoin.
At this point I'm pretty sure that BFL are rolling in cash and it's really not a big deal to lose a few refund claims.
If people really wanted to cause BFL some hassle, they should actually sue them.  When they're drowning in court cases, even if it's just small-claims cases and they start losing those, those have teeth.  There's nothing more satisfying than having the sheriff turn up with a seizure order to collect property worth $xxxx and there be nothing BFL can do about it.
For people with the time and patience to do this I'd love to hear of a few people actually sue them.

A sufficiently rich bad guy bringing a temporary 100,000TH/s to the party would just have to wait a little longer.  Instead of ~5.5 minutes to do the damage it would take ~11 minutes to go to 16x, or ~17 minutes to go to 64x.  I doubt the bitcoin network could respond any more effectively in 17 minutes than 5 minutes. These hypothetical bad guys could still cause just as much trouble with a 400% increase cap.

Almost certainly not.  There is an output that is less than 0.01, which means a fee is **required**.

Miners generate a permanent record and establish a consensus about which fork of a double-spend (or other ambiguities) are to become the "true" one.

@_date: 2013-05-27 14:49:50
Short version:
* 147-149 bytes per input
* 34 bytes per output
* 10 bytes overhead
Note that most transactions have at least two outputs.. one for the payment, and one for the "change" (one of your addresses).
Also keep in mind that addresses are not like bank accounts and don't have a "balance".  If you've received 1000 x 0.00000001 payments to the same address then your wallet has 1000 unspent payments sitting in it. Spending them is going to require 1000 inputs in a spend transaction.
The bitcoin network doesn't track balances.  All it tracks is payments to addresses and whether they're spent or not.  The only thing that does "balances" is your wallet that adds up all the unspent payments it has keys for.
@_date: 2013-10-03 03:48:38
There's a really important issue here.
Not all SSL is equal.  Traditional SSL uses session keys that you can reconstruct if you know the server's SSL secret key.  There's a "new" style called PFS (perfect forward secrecy).  This new style generates a session key that isn't able to be calculated from the server's ssl secret key.
The feds demanded the SSL secret keys.  This allows them to decrypt most of the previously recorded ssl traffic for **most users** - not just the user in question.
The SSL secret key demand from lavabit does not discriminate by user.  It's only used as a wildcard decrypt-all-sessions key on current or previously recorded traffic.
You can bet those NSA farms were recording every single SSL packet from places like lavabit for later analysis.

Unless you create a transaction that reaches thresholds that cause a minimum fee to be mandatory.  If a transaction is larger than 10k, and/or creates an output that below 0.01 then the fees are no longer optional, they are absolutely required.  If they are not included, or are too small, then this happens:

Just to clarify..  fees are optional (but recommended) for most normal transactions that people do.  But there are certain types of transactions that trip the "fee required" triggers, and these *must* have to have a fee, no matter what.  The OP is hitting this by generating a roughly 26kb transaction.
The fee is calculated based on message size, but one of the triggers that makes it mandatory is based on examining the size of the smallest output.
@_date: 2013-05-06 21:21:47
Fees are optional if all the outputs are 0.01 or bigger, AND the transaction is 10K or less.  The problem isn't for you doing the sendmany, it is for the recipient when they try to spend them.
  spells out the existing behavior.
For a recipient to spend a faucet output of 0.00001, they have to get 0.0005 from somewhere else.  They can't group them up either.  Suppose they collect 1000 of those faucet outputs to try and achieve the "free" 0.01 lower limit.  That means they have to spend 1000 of these dust outputs.. and at 148 bytes each that means they generate a 148K transaction - so still not free because its more than 10k.  148K requires 0.07+ in fees so they're still in the hole.
At some point these dust recipients throw their hands in the air and delete the worthless wallet.  The bitcoin network keeps track of "unspent" outputs and can't tell this happened so it is stuck tracking them forever.
The upcoming change isn't about the cost to send the dust.  The change is about what the recipient is going to do with what they can't meaningfully spend.  It's a bad user experience and something the network as a whole is stuck with carrying.  So long as it is cheaper to delete a wallet than spend it, something has to change.
Everyone knows the current fee situation sucks, but it is what we have.  The upcoming 0.8.2 client makes this adjustable rather than hard coded so we actually have a chance of adjusting this.
But yes, to be clear, tiny faucet outputs (along with the satoshidice "you lost" dust) are more harmful than good, as a whole.

Blockchain currencies in general aren't particularly suited for microtransactions.  No amount of cut/paste or renaming or tweaking the fundamental values really solves this.  
Blockchain storage is about high security long term storage, not about boatload of transactions that are barely above the background noise level.
No matter what people think of Ripple, or the people behind it, or the way it was introduced, it does not suffer from this.  Ripple gives up Bitcoin's security and goes to a semi centralized model in return for scalability.  Would I use Ripple as a paypal replacement?  Absolutely!

This is bad advice.
If a fee is *required* according to  then the p2p network will drop the transaction and it'll never even reach a miner.  This is what bitcoind nodes report in their log when they drop it from the network:

Look it up, it never even made it to blockchain.info, didn't get mined..
Fees are optional for non-spammy transactions only.  The network as deployed defines "spammy" as being larger than 10k, or having any output that's 0.01 or smaller.
@_date: 2013-05-27 16:50:16
Sure, if you had a connection to a miner who is willing to include them and bypass the reference client's p2p network, then yes, you could do low or no fee transactions.
But that's the catch.. You can bypass the p2p network's validation checks but that means bypassing the p2p network entirely to reach the miner.
If they get included in a block then the rest of the system will accept them.  But you have to somehow carry the transaction to the miner and the miner has to find a block to include it.

Be very very careful, if you're a US resident you are subject to FBAR (foreign bank account reporting).  If at any time during the year your foreign accounts exceeded $10K, you have to list the highest balance in all your accounts with the US treasury, and include interest on your returns.
Search for "FBAR penalty" and "offshore voluntary disclosure program".  Potential penalties are horrific.  eg: Willful penalties start at $100K.  The voluntary program has lower penalties but is still rather harsh.
If you're doing anything offshore, make damn sure you don't neglect this.

To allow for aging you've also got to deal with the priority threshold.  From the documentation: 














So parking a 0.01 btc on a clean address will require a substantial number of confirmations in order to use it to scrub some dust.
eg: 0.01 btc = 1000000 satoshis. suppose you're trying to spend it in a 200 byte transaction.  Assuming the formula in the wiki page is still correct, then:
57600000/(1000000*200) = 11520
ie: you'd have to leave that 0.01 btc sitting there for 11520 confirmations before you could spend it without hitting the mandatory fee.
Hmm.  Something doesn't add up.  Plugging in the numbers says that you'd have to leave that 0.01 on a "clean" address for 576,000 confirmations before you could use it to "scrub" a 10k transaction made up mostly of dust.  That's almost twice the current life of bitcoin...
Perhaps the numbers and formulas on the wiki are out of date..  But the math does seem to say this can't work.  or I fail at math and need more coffee.  Anyone got more accurate numbers/formulas/code quotes?

At some point you'll want to investigate pywallet and delete the pending transaction from your wallet.  Let the network forget you tried to spend it for a few days then you can redo it.  If you don't delete the pending transaction, your bitcoin client will keep trying to retransmit it forever.

"How would that be undermining bitcoin?"
Right now there is 4000TH/s, give or take.  Imagine this wild scenario..
Suppose somebody comes along with deep pockets and wants bitcoin to fail - REALLY wants it to fail - they don't care about 25BTC/block, they're prepared to burn 7 digits plus to put the virtual currency upstarts back in their place.
With a huge budget and the ability to make their own ASICs suppose they cranked the hash rate to 40,000TH/s.  Or even 400,000TH/s.  The best time to do this is right after a difficulty change.
The effect would be.. instead of 1 block every 10 minutes, it'd be 1 minute or less.  Imagine 1 block per 10 seconds.
Difficulty is recalculated after 2016 blocks.  At 1 minute intervals, that is 33 hours.  At 10 second intervals, that is ~6 hours.  The difficulty would go up 10x, perhaps even 100x if they threw enough money at it.
Then they stop..  The network drops from 400PH/sec to 4PH/sec. The remaining miners are producing one block every 100 minutes (1.6 hours) to 1000 minutes (16 hours).
With a block being generated 1.6-16 hours apart, all of a sudden confirmations back up, the 10MB block limit hits hard, and 2016 blocks to the next difficulty adjustment are a LONG way away.
A malicious 10x transient difficulty spike takes 139 days to recover from.  A malicious 100x spike takes 3.8 years to recover from.
If somebody with a huge budget and malicious intent could do this, we either are forced to put up with a seriously crippled network for months to years, or to hard fork the block chain to reset the difficulty.  Hard fork = where everyone MUST upgrade their validating clients.
And of course, these mythical deep pocketed bad guys could just do it again, so we'd then have to modify everything we do for mining to prevent "unauthorized" miners.  Quite a sea change.
At the end of the day we'd end up with a serious credibility problem.  Nothing that we couldn't fix / hack around, but the non-geek world would would trust virtual currencies ever again.
Of course, nobody has that kind of money to throw at killing a concept, right?  Megabanks, nation states etc don't care enough, right?

no_game_player is correct.
If you own the rights, you can do as you please.  You can give somebody a copy and allow them to redistribute it under GPLv3 terms while at the same time selling binaries to somebody else.
But the key is, you have to own the rights.  Where people run into trouble is accepting contributions from other people.  If somebody gives you a GPLv3 patch, they (as the author of the patch) likely own the rights to the patch.  If you integrate it then you no longer own the entire thing and can no longer re-license it.  You then have to abide by license terms of code you integrated.
This is why some projects require copyright assignments of contributions.  It allows there to be one single "owner" who can adjust the licensing as they see fit.  This might be anything from updating from GPLv2 to v3 or selling commercial copies.
The FSF encourages people to assign copyright to the FSF.  Among other things, it allows them to adjust the licenses.  It also allows the community to be reasonably sure that there won't suddenly be a commercial spinoff from the original author - they could if they owned the rights.
The Linux kernel is an interesting example.  There is no copyright assignment to Linus and the number of contributions is large.  He is not the sole copyright owner so he can't re-license it.

The network itself requires them.  From the link: 








If a transaction trips these thresholds, then the p2p network itself will drop non-compliant transactions and will refuse to relay them.  The network won't even relay the messages to the miners.  It looks like this:


This transaction won't ever confirm and hasn't even made it to blockchain.info  This is not the miners censoring it, but the p2p network itself.
This was an anti-spam self defense measure that has not scaled well.
The operators of Affiliate link spam, bitcoin faucet spam etc know about this.  They've figured out how to craft their payments to minimize their fees and don't care that it is screwing the recipients.  A large portion of faucet spam can't be economically spent unless you acquire more btc from somewhere else..  and even then it takes some effort, like what the OP is discovering.

Footnote: establishing the ability to police transactions has implications in the world of regulation.  Can you imagine somebody getting a court order to reverse a transaction due to theft and then being able to use it as a weapon against any bitcoin user who didn't obey the transaction reversal order?  It's better left as a "can't be done" thing.

The short version is that the search that is offloaded to your GPU is kind of "fast and loose" and is double-checked by the cpu before it is submitted.  The miner authors expect this to happen occasionally.
A small number of verification failure or HW error would mean you've tuned your cards right to the edge of reliability.
A large number would mean you have issues like perhaps cooling or overclocking too far.
A 100% error rate means something is going wrong with communication with the card.. Presumably drivers etc, or some other settings.
Don't lose sight of what the numbers mean. If you had a 1% HW error rate on an overclocked gpu farm, it might not be wise to reduce clock speeds by 5% to make it go away.  The CPU *is* checking.

Be aware they have two status pages.  For me, the top level "Transactions" page is a mess.  There's dates on the Transactions page that don't match anything.. stuff that is "Pending" that has been delivered, stuff that is still "Pending" with no time listed at all.. One transaction was completed and credited a few hours early. Others.. changed dates.. eg: a purchase on 3/15 became 3/20.  A 3/16 got renamed to 3/21.. Not exactly confidence inspiring.
However, the 'Buy/Sell -&gt; Transfer history' page is a little closer to reality but has one purchase that is still "Pending" that was due to complete 3 hours ago.
I haven't been able to *do* anything though.  Trying to make a transfer is still wedged solid and "Pending".

Actually, they do understand, but they just don't care.  All they worry about is how much the fees cost them and they really don't care if the recipients are getting screwed.
This is what the 'block non-economical transactions' thing is about.  It is there to stop affiliate and faucet spammers from sending spam transactions in such a way as to cause an unworkable amount of fees for the RECIPIENT to then spend.

No, this is far from anonymous if you're doing this in the US.  Western Union validates your identity before passing on the transaction.  There does seem to be a threshold though.  US$200 required validation for me, smaller amounts may not.

Don't forget that there is a difference between somebody running a hashing program (cgminer, bfgminer et al) and the pool operator.
Hashing programs have nothing to do with currency at all.  All you are doing is solving a super simplified hash/nonce (ie: a share) and reporting it to the pool.  There's a 1 in 6+ million chance that the share  you submitted also happens to be a viable block hash.
If it is, the pool constructs a block of transactions and distributes it.  It is the pool that is doing anything even remotely related to "money transmission", not the hasher.
p2pool and solo miners are a different case though as both of those cases are involved in transmitting transactions.
hasher (cgminer/bfgminer/bitminter/etc): not involved in transactions
pools / p2pool end users / solo miners: definitely involved in transactions
Running a hash searching program is no more related to transmitting money than running a password hash cracker.

That's different.  Fees are calculated based on message size.  Certain kinds of transactions are allowed to be sent for free.  If the total message is less than 10k bytes, and all outputs are 0.01 or greater then the fee is optional.
Your messages to SD must qualify for this fee exemption or they'd be dropped by the network.
This is not the case for the OP, and I'm guessing it is not the case for Bitco above.

It is really important that people understand what a "Paper Wallet" is.  It is not an "account".  It is the secret private key that allows you digitally "sign" a transaction to "spend" the output of a previous transaction that exists in the blockchain.
The paper wallet doesn't hold bitcoins - they're in the blockchain.  It allows you to spend it.  And spending it is an all-at-once deal.
Once you import the private key into a wallet somewhere and spend part of it, the paper wallet is finished - 100% spent.  You now have "change" in a new key in your electronic wallet.
If you import the private key and spend 5btc out of the 100btc that was sent to the address.. the paper address now has 0btc and a new address got 95btc change sent to it.  This new address is in your wallet and you won't even see it. 
If you want to put it in cold storage again you have to create a new paper wallet and send the change to it.
@_date: 2013-04-01 23:05:20
There are pros and cons each way.  Ultimately though it would probably have more of a negative effect in the long run.  It is bad enough that we already lose coins as it is, let alone voluntarily "destroying" them.
Bankruptcy exists for a similar reason.  At some point it is better all around to cut losses and return what's left back into circulation.
Take it to extremes.. suppose 10 million coins are stolen.  If the collective network were able to blacklist 47% of the coins, then suddenly the percentage of the pool that everyone else owns almost doubles.  And that then creates an incentive to use the tool more and more.
TL;DR version: theft sucks but solutions like this create serious problems too.
@_date: 2013-02-21 07:03:43
One thing you should keep in mind though is that there's multiple aspects to this.
On one hand you could do it as simply as creating a wallet somewhere and just publish a donations address (and a QR code to make it easy).  People that have bitcoins can send some your way.  You don't need a payment processor for this.. the coins just arrive in your wallet.  Since you already have paypal you don't need to put people through the ordeal of buying coins just to donate them.
The question is.. what next?  At some point you may wish to convert to traditional currency for server fees etc.  If you're US based you can use somebody like coinbase to cash out and have them send you an ACH deposit.  There's lots of options.
Also, do you wish to direct curious folks to a place to buy their own coins?  You can point them to one of the lists on weusecoins.com, blockchain.info, coinbase (again), bitinstant, ziggap, etc etc.
Most of all.. don't make this more complicated than it has to be.  Set up a wallet and a donation address and look forward to thinking about what to do next if/when you get some.  Having the "problem" of figuring out what to do with a pile of bitcoins would be a nice problem to have.
@_date: 2013-02-19 16:48:31
You probably need to read 
From the wiki:


What is happening is that you are getting "change" from your transactions.    If you received 10btc and pay somebody 1btc, then a transaction happens that "spends" the 10btc (input) with two outputs - the recipient for 1btc and a new address that you own for the change (9btc).
"Accounts" within a wallet are an artificial thing for your convenience.  See the "move" console command.. you can freely move btc between accounts and it doesn't even go to the blockchain.
You don't really want to delete addresses as that means discarding the private key associated with it. What happens if somebody sends btc to an old address of yours?   Some wallets (eg: blockchain.info's wallet) have an archive facility to reduce the clutter.
@_date: 2013-03-22 04:16:57
You should move it to a personal wallet anyway.  They make their income on the buy/sell fees (which are amazingly low compared to most of the easy-to-access alternatives), not from storage or speculation of the coins.

As a footnote, having a few large pools isn't always a bad thing.  With the recent BDB bug that caused the accidental fork in old clients, the big pools were able to assemble enough hash power to get everybody back on the same chain again.  They were able to do significantly more than 51% between them and outrun the forked chains.

The standard client won't do it with default settings, but you can configure (or recompile) the client to make it generate transactions that the other clients (or miners) won't accept.  There have been more than a few people that convinced themselves that changing the client's code and recompiling should work.
There is also the problem that there is a lot of lightweight clients that don't do validation.  Not to mention online wallets.  Or the raw transaction rpc calls.
The bottom line though is that in spite of the variety of front ends, the official client sets the baseline standards of what's acceptable.  For a transaction to be confirmed, *both* the official client and the miners have to accept it.

Bitcoin never was meant to be a microtransaction system.  It just happened to be reasonably good at it while volumes were small enough.
That's where Ripple and the other contending overlay networks come from.  The basic idea is to add a microtransaction and conversion network on top of things like bitcoin and other things like traditional banks.
Bitcoin is good for secure storage of currency and a means to securely exchange currency.  Note "secure" is the key word.
Note: I don't want to get into a Bitcoin vs Ripple thing here.  They are different things with different goals and has been written about at length.  Some folks feel Bitcoin and Ripple are complementary, others feel they are competitors.  And there is a whole lot of ego invested in the debate.

It is a fairly reliable tactic to take novice "traders" to the cleaners.
Step 1: dump 50k+ at $92 to provoke a selloff.  You now have $0.5 mil cash in your mtgox acct as a war fund.
Step 2: wait for the panic to set in..  all sorts of bitcoins come out of the woodwork.
Step 3: carefully re-buy without outstripping the panic selling.
Step 4: you now have more bitcoins in your account than you started with, *and* leftover cash.
Step 5: rub hands with glee, give an evil laugh, and plan when to do this next.
This is far more effective when there's not much market depth.  This is tactic has been used with currency traders for decades.

Who is going to transmit to a willing miner? If all else fails, you can.  You can bypass the p2p mesh with a addnode=IP:port in bitcoin.conf to send directly.  blockchain.info operates nodes that are extremely permissive and also very well connected.

That's the other thing that's being frequently overlooked in the price hysteria right now. The market is fairly shallow and not a lot of BTC is in play.  Much of the volatility is because there are so few in play - it doesn't take a particularly big buy or sell to cause a fairly large percentage change.
eg: there's people now who seem to be betting that they can make a big buy to move the market up and cause some excitement, and cash in on the Me Too(TM) crowd who join the rally.
