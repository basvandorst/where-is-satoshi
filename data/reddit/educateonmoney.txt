Thank you.
Hahah \- LOL \- "...cryptocurrency market..."
These people have to eventually become smart enough to realize how much scam is infested with all the altcoins.
Bitcoin is ultimate store of value and its popularity has strengthened over time and maximizes value compared to any other altcoin...
All other "blockchains" are more private worthless databases, my old nokia phone can do worthless databases. Other blockchains simply seem like scams...WHY?: 
If it wasn't secure, there would be no value. 
If it wasn't immutable, there would be no value. 
If it wasn't globally distributed, there would be no value. 
If it wasn't resilient, open\-source decentralized and unstoppable, there would be no value. 
If it wasn't so scarce, there would be no value. If it was easy to spam transactions, there would be no value
If it wasn't minable there'd be no economic opportunity \(game theoretic\) cost and no backbone, there would be no value 
If it can be shutdown, and have assets frozen by a bank or government, there would be no value 
If it required a central 3rd party to function, there would be no value 
If it was stopped after all major banks on Earth banned in 2013 to today, there would be no value. \(say "bitcoin" when transacting and watch the block of the transaction. simple workaround=never mention "bitcoin"\). 
If it didn't have the history of 8\+ years \(and still no hacker can exploit bitcoin blockchain\), there would be no value 
Bitcoin is on the verge of lightning network release rendering altcoins as only backup plan options if not dead. If it was exactly like fiat and only did transactions, there would be no value. 
Bitcoin has all the characteristics needed combined to hold the most value and increasing more than any other financial\-asset option coming from the manipulated fiat central\-banking debt\-system. \(more than stocks, more than houses, more than gold\).
If fiat/credit supply stopped growing, then house prices, stock prices, financial assets would crash significantly in value. Governments and laws are controlled by the central banks. Bitcoin is an anti\-establishment revolution that has already solidified itself worldwide.
Those trying to undermine and manipulate bitcoin stem from the central bank system around the world; \-the central banks dictate policy to all the operating big banks around the world and have essentially tried their best to ban bitcoin related transactions for more than four years straight, ever since 2013, and have failed at stopping bitcoin's growth, adoption, and popularity \-the central banks fund efforts to undermine bitcoin, providing plenty of capital and liquidity to private companies and venture backed groups such as Digital Currency Group \(they own Coinbase, GDAX, Kraken, Bitpay, and media outlet Coindesk\) and also Roger Ver/Bitmain \(r/btc\) to undermine and break the bitcoin protocol and/or manipulate trade
Above are just small examples.
Bitcoin's blockchain is the only unique one to provide the most security in a decentralized, global, incentivized fashion \- it cannot be banned nor controlled. For the patient, Bitcoin's price will be at the very least more than 4 times \(400&amp; of todays price in 5 years.
Bitcoin cannot be controlled. It cannot be banned. It cannot be made illegal. And conversely it cannot be legalized. It just simply is. And people can always use it \- its harder than trying to ban the use of the internet.
For global fiat \(US Dollars, Indian Rupees, Chinese Yuan, etc\), the fiat bubble system broke a couple of decades ago.
Fiat around the world is forced to inflate issuance as its heavily infested, burdened and broken with \(the following whether good or bad\): 
\-inflating fiat to keep house\-prices from collapsing 
\-inflating fiat to keep stock market rising 
\-financing conflicts, bombs, missiles/aircraft/embassies, and "aid" 
\-frivolous legal costs \(systemic resources wasted on legal threats, settlements, lawsuits bogging down system\) 
\-regulatory burden on fiat banks &amp; system \(incredibly costly, lots of labor for each $1 in circulation\) 
\-backstopping insurance frauds 
\-costs of auditors and budgetors and accountants checking the same thing over in governments and businesses \(&amp; yet still suspect\) 
\-big insurance loss\-events 
\-unemployment &amp; other welfare costs 
\-stabilize regions after natural disasters 
\-keeping monopolies with internet access and information centralized and search engine crawlers centralized 
\-officially sponsored "money laundering" 
\-backstopping credit chargebacks 
\-state\-sponsored corruption and unofficial corruption \(governments and gangs, banks and conartists\) 
\-retirement obligations \(debasement in value to keep up with payments from government or other retirement\-obligations\) 
\-fake credit \(goods being transacted with credit\-loss, replaced by inflation of monetary base rather than bringing perpetrators &amp; source to justice\) 
\-using enforcement labor to freeze accounts and assets and take away your money
Bitcoin, systemically, is free from these limitations and burdens.

Right on! Yes, I'm grateful that they made recordings of Rothbards past lectures - fun to listen to. If you're curious, I'd like to hear your thoughts on post titled: "Hacks &amp; puppets &amp; forks - how to destroy bitcoin" found here: 
I respect your opinion.
You've helped me get to know more about Nick...me like Mr. Szabo, Thank you. Nick points to current Segwit as "big security flaw by increasing bandwidth reqrmnts. 2MB trad is flaw++ w/o any security benefit."

Fearnot fellow internet patron. 
Bitcoin operates completely independent of any government, authority, or intermediary which is why its so easy to transmit via a communications channel to another country or person. Even without banks like Wells Fargo.
Bitcoin has emerged as the king of all asset classes for store of value. No other asset can touch it, not Stocks, not Gold, not Real Estate, not Bonds.
Wells Fargo will be just one of many puppets around the globe trying to do the same thing - and they will with time, cease to exist as customers will simply move their deposits away from them. 
Bitcoin has been already established around the GLOBE for many years. India, China, Japan, Philippines, Russia, Ukraine, Europe, USA. The fortification made from its full combination of being decentralized, immutable, cryptographically secured, established for nearly a decade, and scarce in supply.
To anyone wanting to learn more about Bitcoin or even world's financial system see post titled: "Hacks &amp; puppets &amp; forks - how to destroy bitcoin"

So you are saying Bitcoin has a problem when you say "this is why we need scaling solution."?
There are so many people in diverse places like the Philippines, Japan, Russia, India, Brazil, USA, Sweden, Indonesia that use Bitcoin it makes me wonder what scaling problem there is. 
Scaling can be introduced (and in some cases already has been) to Bitcoin without touching any code to Bitcoin - right? Coinbase, Localbitcoins, nearly all exchanges do it. One or many 3rd party intermediaries come in to scale. Even fiat cash has 3rd party intermediaries, a la Visa network or Mastercard network being the larger ones. Even these networks don't directly do point of sale, there are many many point of sale companies that offer point of sale services and then in turn use the Visa/Mastercard/Amex/etc networks. There are some point of sale providers that also offer to work off bitcoin sales/network. Also many of the bitcoin exchanges offer issuance of bitcoin debit cards used for things like coffee purchases. Hasn't bitcoin already been scaling for years?

How secure is Bitcoin? Even Elite Hackers have FAILED daily 5+yrs to exploit Bitcoin's Blockchain.
It is becoming clearer that Bitcoin is now established (7+yrs) combined with vested interests globally (diverse places like Phillippines, Japan, Russia, Spain, China, USA, India), has an immutable transparent ledger, crypto-secured, decentralized system of checks with small blocks to withstand spam/blockchain bloat. 
It is uncorrelated with other financial assets, and with past issuance of fiat credit in the world, Bitcoin's price has soared....with further issuance of fiat, will continue to soar.

Microtransactions AND store of value is like buying coffee with your stocks or gold or your house. I wonder why that isnt done?
Good money = microtransactions like fiat? USD and EUR is good money?
If you wait years do the price of goods &amp; services go down with fiat?
Bad money = current bitcoin?
If you wait a few years do the price of goods &amp; services go down with bitcoin?
Adding bloat to blockchain and changing mechanisms for how bitcoin works would be a good way to turn bitcoin into fiat, that is, make it worth less.

5tu, I'm sorry, perhaps one day I'll be more established and we can engage in ideological discussions. Until then, my friend, all the best.  
@_date: 2017-04-10 01:38:51
True and agreed. The most secure is always the trustless route which is what Bitcoin offers and not allowing any other person/organization control of private keys. I am humbly thankful for your engagement with me despite being a reddit newbie.
You bring up an important point because of scams like Mt. Gox, Cryptsy, etc &amp; ....there will be more as there are vested interests that will promote negative perception and dissuade adoption of bitcoin.

Thank you RothbardRand. Your post implies there's a problem with Bitcoin and it needs to be fixed?
There are so many people in diverse places like the Philippines, Japan, Russia, India, Brazil, USA, Sweden, Indonesia that use Bitcoin and this use increasing **every year** makes me wonder what problem there is?
If its scaling, then it can be (&amp; has been) done to Bitcoin without touching any code - right? Coinbase, Localbitcoins, nearly all exchanges do it. One or many 3rd party intermediaries can come in to scale. Even fiat cash has 3rd party intermediaries, a la Visa network or Mastercard network being the larger ones. Even these fiat networks don't directly do point of sale; but instead many many point of sale companies that offer point of sale services which in turn use Visa/Mastercard/Amex/etc networks. There are some point of sale providers that also offer to work off bitcoin sales/network. Also many of the bitcoin exchanges offer issuance of bitcoin debit cards used for things like coffee purchases. Hasn't bitcoin already been scaling for years? 
p.s. BIG FAN of Murray Rothbard here. Are you? Just wondering if its just a coincidence in ur SN. Also Satoshi died in 2013. RIP to both.

thank you grnqrtr. Both yours and frankenmint's posts help many users understand more about wallet mechanics and help calm the alarmed reactions some newbies can get. Bitcoin is quite amazing, especially in its use globally, i mean places like Philippines, Japan, India, Nigeria, Russia, Brazil, and the USA.
@_date: 2017-04-09 22:11:42
Where you've felt difficulty is where you may smell opportunity...maybe think of running a network of bitcoin ATMs around targeted areas by you? volume may be low to start, but perhaps wait a few months. Just sayin...
OP thank you for this, very well written. Bitcoin's use globally is amazing, I mean so many used in Philippines, Japan, Russia, Brazil, China, Indonesia, USA, India...and for many years now increasing each month! 
@_date: 2017-04-09 21:38:35
Than you PGerbil. 
Agree that it shouldn't be done in a way the compromises its important attributes that give it value which includes what you listed but also includes less blockchain bloat, and not increasing capacity for transmission of spam. 
Scaling could also be easily applied by introducing one or many 3rd party intermediaries/networks which does not touch Bitcoin code at all. This is already being done by multiple exchanges (ie Coinbase, Localbitcoins, etc). Fiat has 3rd party intermediaries doing exactly this which are Visa network and Mastercard network. The bitcoin community is smart and will show with time implementing even better solutions. Maintaining the store of value helps already so many engaged in many places globally including the Philippines, Japan, India, Indonesia, Russia, USA.

Thank you DajZabrij.
Isn't "reserve currency" a geopolitical decision made by monarchs &amp; monopolistic central banks. 
Doesn't Bitcoin fall outside such geopolitical restraints? Ie if every government were to both apply strict "regulations" and outlaw it, it would still exist?
Doesn't Bitcoin pass all the smell tests for it to be a financial asset such as stock or gold? 
For example here's a screenshot of S&amp;P 500, gold, real estate, and bitcoin:
The time period used was AFTER the chinese craze end of 2013 - so this is both modest and conservative.
