A few services (e.x. blockchain.info) do encryption in the browser and never send the password to the server, but the vast majority send the unhashed password to the server and do the hashing there before storing in the database (on registration or password change), or comparing to the previously saved hash (on login).
If the service has a "remind me my password" feature that can tell you your actual password, then that's proof they aren't hashing passwords on the backend, but there's no indication of that in this screenshot.
Sending the password in the URL is a n00b mistake though.

Note that payments on Lightning Network are actually pretty much as secure as on the blockchain.
The only caveat is you need to be prepared to broadcast a transaction on-chain within some time period in the case that one of the nodes you have a channel open with decides to try to screw you over (which is unlikely to begin with because if they fail they lose all of their money in the channel). Fortunately this can be securely outsourced to one or more third-party services so your Lightning node doesn't necessarily need to be online 24 hours a day. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:20:44


Definitely not. Trustless off-chain transactions such as those used in Lightning Network are completely consistent with Bitcoin's ideals.
It should be obvious to anyone with a computer science background that decentralized blockchains can't possibly scale to worldwide mainstream adoption without additional layers to offload transactions from the main chain.
That said, Lightning Network still requires funding transactions on-chain, and the current on-chain capacity won't be enough either, so both on-chain and off-chain solutions are ultimately required.

Do Lightning Network nodes need to be full nodes, or can they be SPV nodes?

This appears to be an unrelated fork which has co-opted the "segwit2x" name.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:42:46
Why? If I have the block headers I can confirm my UXTO snapshot is correct for the current block. The only way I could be tricked is if I'm not aware of the correct chain, which is only possible if I'm under Sybil attack or 51% attack (both of which would also affect a full node)
(Again, this would require a change to the block headers to include a hash of the UXTO set)
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:17:16
I've made my choice, Bitcoin or bust. If a flippening were to occur now (or really any point after, say, within 24 hours of the fork) I think I'd lose faith that *any* cryptocurrency will ever be stable enough for mainstream adoption.
But honestly, if said unnamed fork hadn't removed SegWit and wasn't promoted by a bunch of scummy people it might have been a more difficult choice.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:50:54
I don't even know how to respond to this.
Who gets to "auction it off"?
Wouldn't they become "insanely rich"?
Why is it better for them to become rich versus the early adopters who have worked on making it a success for the last ~9 years?
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:00:59
As an engineer, I find BCH’s complete rejection of layer 2 scaling to be incredibly (and obviously) shortsighted. There’s no way Bitcoin can scale to mainstream adoption by simply increasing the block size.
That said, I also don’t think Bitcoin can scale *without* some modest block size increases, and think Core developers are being too conservative. The orphan rate is currently essentially 0%, and it doesn’t really matter if I can’t run a full node on my 5 year old computer if I can’t afford the transaction fees.
But a contentious hard fork like BCH that attempts to co-opt the Bitcoin branding is reckless.
I can count the number of respected blockchain engineers who support BCH on less than one hand. Gavin Andresen. Not sure who else.
I question the motives of several of the major supporters of BCH: Craig S Wright, Jihan Wu, Calvin Ayer, Rick Falkvinge, Kim Dotcom, John McAfee (though notably *not* Roger Ver. I think he’s wrong, but that he believes he’s doing the right thing for Bitcoin. I also think he’s a dick)
On the other side, I have a lot of respect for the engineers and cypherpunks who have brought Bitcoin this far. The Core developers, Adam Back, Nick Szabo, Slush, and many others. I have a hard time believing they’re all conspiring to mold Bitcoin to fit Blockstream’s business model, as BCH supporters love to accuse.
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:03:18
Limiting the block size won’t do much to prevent UTXO size increasing. Consider when everyone has Lightning payment channels open but only transact on-chain very occasionally.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:25:56
If Bitcoin can *never* hard fork I fear it eventually won’t be able compete with altcoins that are.
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:41:49
What if you also verified the last, say, month worth of blocks? If that wasn’t sufficient to know about an invalid block that would mean the miner has been mining with more than 50% of hashing power on an invalid chain for an entire month. If that’s true then we have big problems and you’d likely have heard about it in the news.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:02:27
Let me try to explain my idea another way.
What I’m calling a “UXTO snapshot” is the result of replaying the blockchain up to a certain point. If you have a snapshot and block headers you trust you don’t need the old transactions to verify subsequent blocks.
I’m trying to suggest a way for new nodes to get a UXTO snapshot they can trust so they don’t need to download the entire blockchain. I suspect if the blockheaders included a hash of the current UXTOs, and you verified a certain number of blocks before or after the snapshot then you could get a pretty strong guarantee such as “if I’ve been tricked into accepting an invalid chain then a majority of miners must have been mining on the invalid chain for more than N weeks”.
The only time I could see this happening is if there’s a fork and you want to be on the minority chain, or in a long term 51% attack.
Note this only applies to nodes joining the network for the first time. After that they can be fully validating nodes.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:41:32
I still don't understand Roger's motivation for insulting Andreas. AFAIK Andreas hasn't been especially critical of bcash, has he?
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:00:47
This is exciting, but we're still a long ways from it being useable by average people.
Ultimately we need wallets that support both on-chain and Lightning transactions, and automatically suggests joining/using Lightning Network when it makes sense.
Also an extension to Bitcoin's BIP70 "Payment Protocol" that allows you to send either on-chain or Lightning transactions would be great as well.

If an individual uses CoinJoin or similar are they considered a "tumbler"?
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:16:50




Full nodes can be pruned. not SPV nodes which never receive actual blocks, only headers and Merkle proofs for the transactions they care about. Here’s a good summary 
But yes, basically I want a pruned full node that doesn’t have to download and verify the entire blockchain on initial sync.


“Trust miners” is a bit of a vague term. I think you mean “Trust that the majority of miners are mining a valid chain”.
It just seems like there shouldn’t be any need to validate really old blocks if miners have been building on them for a very long time.
However that assumes the majority of miners mine valid blocks, which might not be a safe assumption if you want to be on the minority side of a fork.


I actually just read Mastering Bitcoin. I’m pretty familiar with how this all works currently. I’m just speculating about ideas that aren’t yet implemented.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:07:04
In computer science terms, increasing the block size is a `O(n)` (linearly) scaling solution (double the processing power/network/storage = double the transaction throughput) but due to Metcalf’s Law we need more on the order of `O(n^2)` (if not more) solutions as the number of users grows, to retain the same level of decentralization (which is the only thing that makes Bitcoin interesting).
But I also think Bitcoin is doomed to fail if we don’t have moderate block size increases.
The difference between BTC and BCH communities is it seems like BTC folks aren’t necessarily opposed to increasing the block size, they’re just very conservative about it (a good thing, IMHO), while BCH folks seem philosophically opposed to layered scaling approaches.

Uh no. If you buy Bitcoin to replace the Bitcoin you just spent then you are offsetting the merchant selling the Bitcoin you just sent them. Hell, it's even possible you end up buying back the Bitcoin you just spent.

*The traditional banking partners that Bitfinex needs to work with are not able to keep up with the demands of the growing Bcash economy.*
*The dozens of people that make up the Bitfinex team are hard at work establishing additional banking partners, that eventually will make dealing with Bitfinex easier for all their customers around the world.

I think most engineers understand big blocks compromise the long term viability of Bitcoin (namely decentralization, the *entire point* of Bitcoin) for a short term solution to high transaction fees.
Non-technical people simply don’t seem to understand this. 
That said, I do wish Core supported a small block size increase to give some more breathing room while off-chain scaling solutions matured and Segwit wallets became widely used.

Honestly nothing in those emails is surprising to me and I’ve only been casually following this stuff.
I don’t know why so many people (on both sides of the debate) see the different scaling solutions as mutually exclusive or a zero-sum competition. If L2 solutions like LN and sidechains allow Bitcoin to be widely used then the transaction fees they take will be a portion of a *much* bigger pie, and the net transaction fees taken by miners should also be much higher.
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:32:20

If this is legit Bitmain will soon only be able to profitably mine Bcash using ASICBoost, since Bitcoin adopted Segwit and is no longer vulnerable to ASICBoost, but Bcash did not.

Running a node won't help. Mining will (in theory, depending on hashrate) help until the next difficulty adjustment.
