You could also buy a half bitcoin or a tenth or so, bitcoin is a fractional currency, so for example you could buy 1/1000 BTC (one mBTC) and use it.
At the moment mBTC is in the same range as 0.66$ and 0.5€.

Photoshop is still a problem, that's right. But the problem with a more polished desktop experience is not that large. Luckily with KDE you can customize **everything**. Every. Single. Panel.
So if your desktop experience wasn't perfect, you could have optimized it yourself. And if you can customize everything, you can reach even a higher efficiency than with one-size-fits-all.

The battery life depends on your system. If you've got all drivers then Linux is much more efficient than Windows and almost as efficient as MacOS. But even without the drivers its's still much more efficient than Windows.

Actually you're only talking about advantages of *nix over Windows, not Apple over the the rest. Because all you mentioned also applies to Kubuntu running on a Lenovo Thinkpad. It just works, everything is stable and fast, all Unix tools available, etc.

I've never had a problem with dependencies on my system and I've got a couple of sideloaded packages (for example AutoDesk Maya, installed via alien).
And KDE is completely customizable – you can make it look and feel exactly like MacOS. Or you could just install elementaryOS if the look and feel is of such importance for you.

Your Bitcoin app stores its data in a sqlite database in /data/local/0/com.developer.appname/sqlite.db
This folder is chowned to com.developer.appname with chmod 700.
Any other questions? There is no possibility for any other app to read this data.

EDIT: If you say, there are other possibilities: Please tell me which, so I can open a bug in the AOSP Bug Tracker.

Each Android app has per default only one folder it can access, and only this app can access this folder. You can grant apps the right to access the sd card, but no app can ever access local stored data of other apps*.
Sorry, but your hate is wasted. No Flashlight app can ever take your BTCs.
 
*Unless you give them root-privileges. But you would only grant these to trusted apps.

Unity is going to switch to Mir – No, Thanks, I'll use Wayland via KWin with KDE.

These are also Problems on iOS.


Only the On-Screen-Keyboard and the Foreground App know what keys were pressed, and before activating a Third-Party-Keaboard Android warns "This app can see all text you write, including passwords. Make sure you can trust this app."


As I said: If they use SQLite or save the data via the file system, in both cases the data will be unreadable by other apps.
Please tell me, which possibilities are on Android which aren't on iOS.
