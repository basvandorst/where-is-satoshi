The recovery seed *is* your private key basically (or can be used to generate all the private keys in your wallet).  That key is also stored on the device itself, but you write it down on paper in case you lose the device.
The private keys are not stored on mytrezor.com.  That site just provides information about the blockchain so that you can view your balance, transactions etc.
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:27:16
So did bitgo get compromised then?  Were the coins stolen from a multisig address?

Or you just haven't heard of tx priority.
@_date: 2016-04-23 07:37:29


This often gets repeated, but I don't get it.  Addresses are just scripts.  Spending to an address is creating an output script.  Inputs to a transaction are just values that satisfy previous scripts.  So why is it valid to say you can send money "to" an address, but not valid to say money can come "from" an address?

You can spend it via the lightning network instantly, because your peers are aware of who owns what.  Or, you can wait to settle it via the blockchain.
It's sort of like exchanging IOUs, but the IOUs are signed contracts.  If someone decides to cheat, you take your contracts to the blockchain and the blockchain settles the dispute fairly so that you won't ever lose money (but you'll have to wait some time for the contracts to settle, because the contracts allow the other party time to provide their evidence).

That's not the original chain, that's another hard fork.  The original chain is the original chain.

I think this is a bit of a confused description.  The address IS the script.  It's just a shorthand form.  There is one and only one script per address, which is derived from the address specification.  Private keys are not relevant, other than they can be used to satisfy the scripts that addresses represent.


I don't see the relevance of users and keys to what an address is.  If you try to relate addresses to users and keys, then I can see how it would blur the concept of to/from.  If you consider addresses are JUST scripts, then the to/from thing is pretty clear.

And 229 views too - pretty impressive.
@_date: 2016-04-20 08:54:59

@_date: 2016-04-22 12:14:44
That's not really answering my question.  Your comment says that it "never was intended to apply to bitcoin", but that is directly contradicted by the draft which specifically mentions bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-04-21 21:23:18

@_date: 2016-04-22 12:25:15
BIP9 is a mechanism for signalling support for softforks.  It uses a bitmask in the "version" field of the block header, hence its name "version bits", so that each bit can be assigned to a different softfork.  It also defines rules and thresholds around when a soft fork will activate or fail to activate.
@_date: 2016-04-23 01:02:43
"Private blockchains" is just a term for banks modernising their settlement systems so they move closer to real-time instead of taking days for a bank-to-bank transfer.  It still would involve permissions and trust, so it's not the same as bitcoin's blockchain.

@_date: 2015-12-11 22:51:35
There are around 2^25 spendable outputs in the blockchain currently. Even assuming they all use unique 160-bit addresses, that's average of 2^160 / 2^25 = 2^135 distance between keys that have money on them. This is well beyond the capability of computers to search. Not to mention, you're now doing a whole lot more work when checking each key because you have to scan some tree in memory for every pubkey hash to find if it's in the utxo set.
@_date: 2015-12-08 12:06:28
Exactly.  I think people are celebrating segwit a bit too hard, like it's some kind of silver bullet for scaling, when it's really just a nice-to-have for improving SPV clients and initial sync.

We need to cruise casually past $500 first.  I like how this rally has had very little hype go with it.  It's like people will only start getting excited once we start hitting new 2015 highs.
@_date: 2015-12-08 10:38:36
But it doesn't seem to deliver any scaling benefits to fully validating nodes, other than during the initial sync if they skip validation.  In fact, wouldn't this *increase* the total size of the data that full nodes need to download, since there are now additional merkle branches, plus each tx needs a reference to the location of its witness data?
@_date: 2015-12-11 22:42:34

If you've got the disk space and know-how, you could set up a script to stop your node daily and back up a copy of your datadir (using rsync or something). After a crash you can restore from a recent backup which shouldn't require reindexing.
@_date: 2015-12-08 09:14:53
I'm scouring these comments but still can't find a clear explanation of segwit's effect on tx size. If a full node operator today wants to keep the same security model under segwit then they will need to download the witness data.  So someone please tell me, will segwit's total block size *including witness data* result in more densely packed transactions? Or is it actually introducing more bandwidth overhead for fully validating nodes?
@_date: 2015-12-23 20:23:35
A hard fork is when a block that is invalid under the old rules becomes valid under the new rules. In other words, old nodes would reject the new chain until they upgraded.

If the price of strawberries goes up, farmers grow more strawberries because farmers like to make more money. Now replace farmers with miners and strawberries with hashes.
If you're wondering what the "price of a hash" is, it's (BTC REWARD PER BLOCK) * (BITCOIN PRICE) / (EXPECTED NUMBER OF HASHES TO CREATE BLOCK).
And in case you didn't know, more hashes = more blocks, unless difficulty rises. Bitcoin difficulty automatically goes up when miners hash more, to keep the rate of new blocks at 10 mins avg interval.
Putting it all together, higher bitcoin price makes difficulty rise.
@_date: 2015-12-15 10:40:33
I think you misunderstood what I was saying.  Your machine image is customer data.. they don't care what's on that and shouldn't be looking at it.  But the packets you send out your NIC goes through *their* network that *they* own, and this is where they will inspect the flows and apply policy.  If your instance is connecting to the Tor network, then that might explain why they're banning you.  I don't know their policy, but it sounds like the most plausible explanation to me.

You download the block from just 1 peer (the first one to offer the block, last time I checked). If you're a well-connected node, you might be the first to offer it for a large portion of your peers. Also transaction relaying adds more traffic.
@_date: 2016-03-05 22:47:47

That's exactly the problem that weak blocks / IBLTs address. Also there has been a "fast relay" network between miners for years, where they only send transaction hashes. But the standard bitcoin core relays whole blocks, regardless of the transactions your peers already know about.
@_date: 2016-03-14 09:37:54
What about IBLTs?  I like the thinblocks system you presented because it's simpler, but IBLTs have some advantages, such as being of constant size, and also not needing your peers to send you bloom filters.

Actually no.. seriously stop showing your ignorance.  Go ahead and have a go at changing the trezor firmware and trying to hide the warning on boot.. it'll be a good project for you to actually develop some of the skills you claim to have.  And then you might also realize that software doesn't control everything.
@_date: 2016-06-16 11:35:14
Lol, you're getting more desparate with your responses.  Reflashing the device's firmware is again a feature that requires physical approval on the device, and which shows the hash of the firmware on the device screen for approval.  You won't get new firmware onto the device without physical possession of it.  In addition, the unsigned firmware (ie. your hacked firmware) will cause the device to wipe its storage, and will also display a warning every time the device starts up.
I have no idea why you think open source code makes something less secure, rather than more secure.  That, amongst other things you've said, hints to me that you are not a capable engineer.

@_date: 2016-06-01 08:18:21
So how would this work in a distributed way?  Each node initially knows only the cost of their 1-hop path to each of their *direct* peers.
If all nodes transmit their 1-hop route table to their directly connected peers, then this allows all nodes to then calculate a 2-hop routing table.  They could repeat this in iterations until everyone is aware of their surrounding 20-hop optimal paths.
Is this what you had in mind?
@_date: 2016-06-22 19:18:46
The larger block would arrive first for some well-connected miners with high bandwidth connections and ability to validate blocks faster.  For other miners, the smaller block would win.  That produces a chain fork.  If the problem is happening every block, you don't reconcile the fork, you just create two chains.
@_date: 2016-06-15 23:52:18
Actually no because the trezor is not capable of leaking the private keys.  It's designed so that no drivers can pull the keys off, because it's just not a feature of the hardware to transmit the keys.
As for your first point, trezor also allows you to write down the seed on paper, so you do actually have the private keys which gives you all options as well.

In the medium term (5 - 10 years), if it gets popular, the blockchain itself will probably just be for settlement, and the Bitcoin system as a whole will be p2p cash.  By "bitcoin system" I mean all the layers on top of it, like lightning, sidechains etc.
Long long term (30+ years), it can probably support a very high rate of on-chain transactions, but that'll come in the future when we have much higher bandwidth, lower latency, and better compute power.

So each node has its own view of the global topology?  I haven't heard of routing protocols working like that.  I thought typically you'd just keep a table of all the end destinations you can reach, and which interface (peer slot) the first hop is through, and the total cost.  You shouldn't need to understand the topology beyond your direct peers.
Also, what will be the mechanism to prevent people sybil attacking the network and falsely advertising routes that they don't fulfill?

You're going to have to elaborate on that further.  I can't tell if you're talking about finney attacks or something similar, because you're being vague.  As stated in the bitcoin whitepaper, it's recommended to wait 6 confirmations before considering a payment to be safe against double spending.


That's not such an accurate description.  Bitcoin is trustless "as long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network".  That's strait from the paper.  It's no secret that if &gt;50% of hash power colludes to do fraud, then the network is not safe.  That's been a clearly stated caveat of bitcoin from day 0.  There is no known way to achieve decentralized consensus without that assumption, so we have to accept it, regardless of how big or small we set blocks.
@_date: 2016-06-05 21:17:20

I agree that miners shouldn't be agnostic because they're looking to optimise fees and utility value of the blockchain.  I mean full archival nodes can be agnostic, because they'll be storing a full chain regardless of its contents (which I would expect to remain at the blocksize limit for the forseeable future).
@_date: 2016-06-22 19:08:09
It doesn't actual reduce total bandwidth compared to blocks-only relaying.  It reduces peak bandwidth.  You still ultimately need to download and validate every transaction, and if you can't keep up with that, you can't validate the chain for yourself anymore.

The media is a bit confused when they say the pound has hit 31 year lows.  In reality it's at an all-time low, as is USD and other fiat currencies that continue to devalue year after year.
The fact that they "gained" 10% in exchange rate on the USD since the 80's is not something to be proud of - it just means they trashed their currency *slightly less* than the US did.

So wait until all the important and meaningful work is done (all the features going out now like CSV, SegWit, compact blocks etc) and then we can start bumping the constants up.  No one intends to stay on 1MB forever, but it's time to make this system as well designed as possible before ramping up constants and harming decentralisation (yes, decentralisation matters more than anything, and it's not a binary thing, it's a spectrum and it can get worse).

I don't care how you want to define the word.  If you plan on never ever spending your bitcoins, just burn the privkeys now.  Otherwise, you better have a plan for how you're going to spend them, and if you don't, then you really haven't thought through your security.  Having a paper wallet is only half of the plan.
To get back to your original question.. no it is NOT the safest route if you can't securely spend from it.

I don't know a lot about it, but my understanding is that malleability breaks the initial funding of the channel.
For example, if I'm starting a payment channel with you and I want to put 5 BTC into it, with the initial state being 5 BTC is mine an 0 is yours, we collaborate to make a multisig address that requires both our signatures, and then I generate a funding transaction, but before I broadcast the funding transaction I need to get your signature on a refund transaction that gives me back the 5 BTC.  To be able to guarantee the refund, I can't have malleability, because the refund tx includes the ID of my funding tx.  Otherwise, when I go to fund the channel, you could modify my funding transaction ID which invalidates the refund.  Now I'm left with 5 BTC stuck in a multisig address and I need to negotiate with you to get anything back.

So first you're saing you'll create bad drivers, then when you realise that doesn't work you say you'll create bad firmware, then when you realise that doesn't work you say you'll steal it and get it into a lab and extract the keys with specialised harwdare.  Now there's another thing you realise - this microscope attack only works if you don't put a passphrase on the wallet.  My device has a strong passphrase, so you're out of luck
Anyway, what I'm saying is that trezor reduces bitcoin security to physical security which is something that everyone is familiar with.  Ie, keep it safe in your house and your bitcoins are safe.  You do not have to worry about plugging it into a computer with malware, because the hardware is safe against remote attacks.
It's also safe against someone MITMing the physical delivery of the hardware (something you previously claimed you could do by adding bad firmware).  That attack you linked only applies to a wallet that's already been received and set up by the user, in which case someone needs to gain access to my house, steal the trezor and then get it into a lab.  And again, only works if a passphrase wasn't applied.
Next you're going to claim that you'll pull off some NSA-level attack.

I don't understand what you're disagreeing with.  Bitcoin is trustless when you can fully validate the chain.  When you can't or won't validate the chain for yourself, then trust gets involved.  Are you disagreeing with that?

@_date: 2016-06-16 01:22:21
Correct.  If you use coinbase you are transferring the responsibility of storing the bitcoins to them.  They still have to deal with the issues of safe storage themselves.
People have been burnt in the past with trusting third parties.  It's fairly easy to take custody of the coins yourself if you use a hardware wallet like trezor ( and keep a paper backup of your seed.  You have to decide which security/trust model best suits you.

Well, my point is not really about the definition of "wallet" because that's just semantics and it's up to the individual how they want to define it.  The real point I want to make is about security.  You can't say paper wallets are the most secure, because it is quite hard to securely spend from them.  Most people will use very bad security when spending from them, which means your coins are more likely to be stolen when you eventually go to spend them.  If you're just printing out a private key, that's only a small part of the whole security picture.
A solution like trezor guarantees a secure way to spend that anyone can do, so I would argue trezor is far more secure.

I'm not talking about an honour system here, it's in plain sight for anyone who trades on there.

As I said originally, your conspiracy theory only works if the entire exchange is fake and it's not actually possible for anyone to join and start trading.  If that was the case, it would have been made pretty obvious by now if no one in China could actually trade on there.

Here's one listed on ebay for $3k: 
As you can see they trade for quite a premium over the actual 1 BTC value.  But given yours is damaged, I'm not sure what you'd get for it.
If you want to just redeem the 1BTC, you need to peel off the sticker to reveal the private key, and then import that into a wallet.  Then you should probably send the coin to more secure storage after that.

Bitcoin is trustless because full nodes can validate the blockchain without trusting miners.  If this ceases to become possible, there is little point in having the blockchain as we fall back to trusting a handful of entities.
Regarding the chain fork, it is possible if a small number of well-connected miners work on a large chain that the remaining miners cannot keep up with.  Over time, the network would centralize as all the full nodes and smaller miners are pushed out.  Those who kept mining despite the lack of keeping up would be at risk of producing a fork, because the miners who were behind wouldn't be mining the tip, and the other "slow" full nodes validating blocks would also be behind the tip, so naturally it can produce chain forks of different bandwidth levels.

One option you have is to peel of the sticker to reveal the private key, and then load that priv key into a bitcoin wallet and try to sweep the coins.

I would not trust a private key that was generated with javascript in a browser.  Javascript isn't always great for cryptographic random numbers.
The other thing is that you pulled the bitaddress.org code off the web, and presumably didn't audit it, so you could be compromised there.
Why not use a real wallet to generate the keys?  Like, get a signed version of bitcoin core, verify the signature, and then use it to generate some priv keys.
Better yet, generate a BIP32 wallet and store the seed, so that you have unlimited addresses to send your future savings to.

You can't say that without providing a detailed proposal.
How long will you mine on a header without receiving the full block?  Unlimited time or will you define a time limit?  If so, what is the limit, and what will you do when you reach it?
If you mine a block on top of an unvalidated header, do you broadcast it or withhold it?  In either case, do you begin extending that unvalidated chain a 3rd block, or if not, which chain do you switch to?  What about if you find the 3rd block, and so on - are you defining a limit?  What do you do if you reach this limit?
If you receive a 2nd header on top of an unvalidated header, will you switch to extending that chain, or continue on the first header (orphaning the 2nd), or if not, what action will you take?  What about 3 blocks and so on - are you defining a limit?  If so, what do you do when the limit is reached?
Whether you choose to ignore these scenarios because you think they're improbable, your code *will* have some behaviour in these cases and I need to know what it is before I could say that it's safe.

With the first seen system, once you make a transaction you can't alter it. Eg. If I make a payment, I will end up with unconfirmed change in my wallet, and if I wish to make a 2nd payment a few minutes later to , I'd have to create a 2nd transaction which either spends the unconfirmed change, or spends other unspent outputs in my wallet. But with RBF, if the first tx hasn't yet confirmed, I can alter it to contain both my 1st and 2nd payments in the same transaction, thus saving on space.  It might not seem like a big deal for the average user, but think about a service which is making many payments per block. It can roll them up into a single tx, without having to buffer them up in advance. This benefits everyone by saving block space, and also reduces their fees.


I mean the lighting network and other payment channels-based technology. They can make 0-conf safe in a trustless way. Implementing RBF incents people to use this more secure method of payment.

While it is good that you are questioning this change and trying to protect bitcoin, I think you are wrong for the following reasons:
1) Bitcoin is trustless.  Its design philosophy prefers hard cryptographic proof over "good will" among participants.  Its adherence to this principal is best shown by its mining feature, which today burns quadrillions of compute cycles per second just for the purpose of ordering transactions in a trustless way.
The first-seen rule goes against this principle, as it operates on good will.  This isn't a reason in itself to eliminate the rule, but it is a reason why the rule is not critical to bitcoin's design, and it is a reason why we shouldn't hold on to it if there's a reason to remove it (which takes me to point 
2) Removing the first seen rule enables efficiencies and innovation.  The main benefits I can think of are: remove stuck transactions, reduce fees, and enhance security (through smarter contracts that use cryptographic proof to prevent double spending).
So I would argue that we have good reasons to remove the first seen rule, and only very weak, unbitcoinlike arguments for holding on to it.  I strongly believe that in the future we will look back and realise that dropping the first-seen rule was the only way to go.

You're confused because you're asking this question:


Apply this to fiat money.  How does printing a $20 bill create actual money?  Well, it does because people put trust in it and value it, and are willing to trade their goods and services for it, because they know other people trust it and accept it too.  It has value because we all put our collective shared faith in it.
Bitcoin is no different in that respect.  The main difference is how it's issued.  It's not a printed piece of paper.  It's essentially an entry on a digital ledger which is collectively maintained by the public, and anyone can participate and help verify the honesty of the system.  That's where mining comes into it, but it's really not that necessary to understand the technical points behind mining to understand that bitcoin is money.

Because if there's no agreed upon limit, this will cause inevitable hard forks when some nodes are able to accept a super large block, and others fail due to OOMing or disk full errors.  There needs to be a specification of limits in order to ensure your node is going to be compatible with the rest of the network.
@_date: 2016-05-21 21:09:10


I'd contest that. If it is designed to not have full blocks, that's a mistake that we need to fix.  Full blocks are likely to be the norm going forward, whatever the block size.

Yes, they come as a bundle, collectively known as "CSV".  There is just a single flag to indicate support for all 3.

I like this page because it shows you the transations streaming in and the satoshi-per-byte fee on them: 
@_date: 2016-05-31 09:49:07
No it's not.  Empty blocks is not the only implication of SPV mining.  It also adds proof-of-work to invalid chains which means an attacker can use *others'* hash power to amplify their attack.  It's very dangerous.

Dust inputs should not be rejected. Spending them does service to the whole network in cleaning up the UTXO set.

The wording of bip9 is a bit confusing.  It says the deployment state will be "STARTED for blocks past the starttime."  Only further into the doc do you realise that it actually is only STARTED for blocks past the first retargetting following the start time.

Lol this guy is a nut.  Why is he wearing a suit?  lol...
@_date: 2016-05-30 21:09:07
Not if you're counting latency as the time between receiving the inv and constructing the whole block locally (which is how this article measures it).
@_date: 2016-05-30 13:48:28
What about the possibility that the state is funding the miners and accumulating a large reserve of bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-05-21 21:22:16
Not really.  First you should learn what confirmations are, and then you could look at  to calculate the expected number of blocks until first confirmation, then use some math to calculate a poisson distribution of likely times you will have to wait.

Nice try, but that wouldn't be enough knowledge for you to mine blocks.

What are you basing the percentages on?  Bitcoin fees are ranked in fee-per-kilobyte, not percentage of total transaction amount.


That's also complete rubbish..

Ah the old internet boom of 1900.  Some people were still caught up in the gold rush, but the real money was being made on the early web.  It really was the wild west back then.

The halving cuts the supply in half, it doesn't change difficulty (which is what defines how "hard" it is to mine bitcoins).  Difficulty auto-adjusts every 2 weeks according to the network's hash rate.

I thought they invented the winkdex for this very reason.  It has a weighted formula across exchanges.

This sounds a lot like bitcoin mining.  Everyone will rush into it thinking "free money".  Until the cost of a ride becomes so cheap it's only marginally profitable for the providers who can maintain their fleet the cheapest.
@_date: 2016-07-21 09:44:30
This looks like a really clever way to visualise it.  I would like to see sat/kb rather than normalised fiat cost.
Also would be good if the vertical height of the boxes was scaled with the fee rate.  I kind of assumed it was, until I read that you just increment by a constant amount for each fee level.

This statement is a bit confused.  In a transaction, all of the inputs (unspent outputs from previous transactions) and consumed, and new outputs are created.  So the whole set of inputs are no longer utxo's since they become spent.  All of the outputs of a transaction are new utxo's since they are now all unspent.  The sum of the outputs is equal to the sum of the inputs, minus the transaction fee paid.  One or more of the new outputs will be the user paying change to themself, if the sum of the inputs was more than they wish to send to the recipient.
Edit: In thinking further, I think you're asking, if the wallet had multiple utxo's belonging to the same pubkey, why wouldn't it always add *all* of those to a transaction, so that they become spent at the same time.  The answer is that a) this would add extra size to the transaction, hence requiring a larger fee, b) it's unnecessary, if you're using ECDSA correctly.  Address re-use is about privacy, not really security, unless you're paranoid about ECDSA being broken.

But doesn't the light also travel at an angle, and bounce up and down the edges of the fibre?  So that would make it go a longer distance.
@_date: 2016-07-03 06:39:09
A wallet.dat contains all the unspent outputs in it, and a marker for the block height it's up to, so you don't need to fully rescan the chain to find all the outputs.  Bitcoin core provides a -rescan option if you do want to do a full rescan, which can take a while.
A BIP32 seed alone doesn't tell you the outputs, so you'd have to do a full scan of the chain to find them.

As someone who has been through that cycle, I'm also tired of these hyperbolic articles.
@_date: 2016-07-09 22:27:46
Very unlikely it goes that quickly this time.  Last halving period contained the transition from GPUs to 1st gen asics, and then all the generations of asics through till now where it's quite matured.  The hash rate grew by many orders of magnitude during that time, sometimes growing at ~20% every 2 weeks for months on end.
We won't see that kind of acceleration in the hash rate again unless there's some equivilent technology cycle, which doesn't look likely.
@_date: 2016-05-10 10:11:09
Core is planning a hard fork?  Do you have more details?
@_date: 2016-07-13 20:21:39
You're just overthinking it.  The price is essentially a random walk in the short term.  A random walk is expected to move X steps in any direction after X^2 random steps.  It's very unlikely that you are going to buy in and never see the price go below your buy price.
