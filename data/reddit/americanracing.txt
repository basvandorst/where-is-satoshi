I dont have an account with them no, from what I hear coinbase is good if you bought from them before but if you haven't there is alot of delays.

its like paying for deposit no?
@_date: 2014-06-09 16:53:24
i understand with paypal you could charge back, but thats the risk you take, thats why im only buying a small amount on reddit. if i wanted more i could use virwox or coinbase but more delays and higher fees
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:40:28
cool it worked! that was my first tip ever, now I wont be so shy when giving out tips, its real easy to use.
