Yes, but what are the gains? They are in dollars. If you have not cashed out you have no actual gains. You cant really spend your crpyto, apart from on pretty niche things. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:52:08
Jesus, why would anyone pay those fees? That's insanity
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:15:53
The price you bought at shouldn't matter. At all. If it does, you are trading wrong. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 04:57:03
That analogy only works if Obama was not now president, but something kinda more important.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:32:59
What possible reason is there for not answering a yes or question with yea or no?
Isn't the fundamental pillar of debate to answer the question you are asked. If you don't you are not debating in good faith
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:02:54
calm down pal
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:31:55
Doubling money over 20 years is very unimpressive. At an average of 7% interest you'd expect to quadruple it.
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:31:50
Being better than an average lottery winner is not impressive. The lottery self selects mostly idiots
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:32:05
Please answer the yes or no question with yes or no. I have now asked you three times. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:23:32
There is a reason people dislike giving yes or no answers. It's because it locks them in and they can't wriggle out of it. Its like politics, they don't give yes or no answers because they always want to be able to pretend they meant something different.
If you refuse to give a yes or no answer to a question (feel free to qualify it!) Then you are clearly attempting to hide something, and not arguing in good faith. 
So yes, I agree it's not necessarily am adult thing to do, becuase adults are liars to. Not giving a yes or no answer is something liars of all ages do.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:02:44
wow, calm down mate. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:58:07
None of those words were yes or no. Are you saying "yes" I could conduct my day to day busienss in bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:19:09
To be fair to her, if it's not in the bank it's not real. It's an investment until it produces gains :)
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:51:06
Jesus, why would anyone pay those fees? That's insanity
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:40:05
So, back to the original point. Can i conduct my day to day life in bitcoin? Yes or no?
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:33:32
Firstly, we have no idea if he has that. He's a liar, so it's likely he doesn't.
Also, he made.most his money by refusing to pay people. That's not being good at business. That's basically being a crime.boss.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:28:22
You know that's not true. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 10:46:52
Asking people to answer the questions they are asked? No, that's literally the opposite of childish, it's being a grown up
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:50:57
Jesus, why would anyone pay those fees? That's insanity
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:02:50
calm down buddy
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:56:55
I don't understand why you refuse to and a yes or no question with yes or no. In my experience people dislike providing concrete answers as it means they can't wriggle out of it if it's shown they are wrong.
Yes. Or.  No?
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:03:45


That is clearly the part i was referencing, which is correct. It doenst matter how much you have in bitcoin until you cash it into fiat. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:49:13


Again, that doesnt matter. The price you bought at should in no way influence your decision to sell or hold. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:33:11
Yes,but you can buy bitcoin and not transfer. E.g. buy the hash etc off someone
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:30:44
He's a rapper. even most successful ones are thick. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:08:06
DO you really think anyone is declaring bitcoin for taxes?
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:33:06
If you will be ruined sell some. Sell down the the point where if it all went to zero if wouldn't be the end of your world.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:16:34
Ok, you are clearly an idiot. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:58:51
Why would it make any difference? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:06:08
When you say most didn't claim. I don't quite know what's going on with it. I have I my ever bought bitcoin with coinbase. Should I be "claiming some bch" due to the fork?
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:16:45
Why not litecoin?
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:39:33


You literally gambled on bitcoin. You can pretend it was a "wise investment" but it was literally rolling a die. The fact that you got lucky doesnt make it anything else. 
Also, you were willing to lose half your total money? Thats just awful money management. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:30:08
Hes not defensive, you are just making shit up, and not even shit that sounds believable, its just stupidity. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:11:16
So, being the idiot I am, i bought through coinbase. I am not looking to buy any more, but dont want to eat the 4% selling fees when i do, as itll be non negligable. 
Sorry If im asking a lot here, but is it really that easy to sell through Gdax. Im not great at this. (I work in Finance so im pseudo-literate around this, but just dont know how Gdax itself work....)
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:55:49
No. Nononono. That advice is AWFUL. The decision to sell should not in ANY way be influenced by the price you bought it at (tax aside)!
That is the cardinal sin of investing!
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:21:05
To be fair, it now is literally a Ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:15:13
Where you bought makes no difference to what you should do....
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:54:50
People aren't arguing if it's.a bubble. They are arguing this isn't it bursting.
This sort of correction has happened like 5 times this year.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:31:51
That's just wrong...
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:51:55
Mate, you gambled and won. Good job. 
I understand bitcoin. You dont seem to understand investing in highly volatile markets is almsot literally gambling. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:35:32
This is the single worst piece of advice anyone can recieve. Please, anyone reading this, please, ignore this post. 
Once you hold an asset, the past does not matter. What you bought it for does not matter. Trying to hold on to "make your money back" is how gamblers lose everything. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:05:26
I am in the UK and British, excellent.
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:59:45
What? When?
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:20:55


You should never, ever look at that. Ever. 
Look at where it has been? Sure. But where you personally bought it should never ever weigh into ANY decision making. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:18:58
You didn't invest to make money, you invested to have more money.
Would you rather be person A or B? 
A lost 5k and now has 100k
B gained 5k and now has 50k
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:25:14
There is a difference between not riding out volatility and just not knowing the future.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:07:11
Great thanks :)
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:43:36
I didnt say it was.....
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:11:12
Did you have it In Coinbase? If so,  how did you actually sell?
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:49:00
Isn't it 4% both big and sell?
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:02:52
If you want to make money, that strategy makes you an idiot.
If you want to have fun, do your thing :)
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:58:00
I think it's the perfect top post. It's the only thing in here which gives helpful info.
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:20:55
But it doesnt work for the majority of the world. And most importantly it doesnt work for most investors. 
Do you honestly think people are buying bitcoin to spend it, or to hold as they think it will increase in value?
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:41:48
Yes, but holding to 0 out of principle is just idiotic. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:11:43


I dont see whats wrong with that...
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:06:11
This all makes so much more sense. Thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:51:03


If I offer you a 50-50 bet of you rolling a 6, and you take it. It doesnt matter if you rolled a 6, it was a BAD bet. The outcome of a bet has no influence on whether the bet was good or not. Thats basic maths. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:53:12
No. That is wrong on so many levels. It is in fact the cardinal sin of investing. Literally the most important thing to never, ever, ever do. 
Once you own something, the price you paid for it no longer matter. You now have the thing. NOT the money you paid for it. 
How much you lost/gained doesnt matter. What matters is how much you have once you sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:40:45
So a guy managed to pay his phone bill. With a specific company. 
As you didnt answer my questions I will. No. No. No and No. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:41:29
Why is that relevant? Whether a decision works out well does not impact whether it was a good decision or not. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:58:48
Looking at gdax, there isn't one
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:45:44
That just makes no sense. Unless you care more about "winning" than actually getting money.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:08:32
Thanks for that bud. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:57:28
Do you really think people in Europe/America are buying to use as a currency?
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:19:13
It's how the animals attack. Bears swipe down, bulls horn up. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:47:57
No, you guessed and got lucky. That's all there is to it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:57:13
I see this so much. You do realise this is literally the cardinal sin in investing? Like the number one thing to never ever do?
What you paid for something is irrelevant. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:36:08
No, that makes 0 sense. It is the cardinal sin of investing. It's the worst thing you can do. Once you have bought an asset the price you bought it for no longer matters (tax aside).
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:31:41
They are CURRENTLY not viable. 
If I cannot use a currency for my day to day business, it is not currently a currency, it is an investment. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:52:03
If you honestly dont understand that, you ahve more in depth problems. 


And THAT is why there needs to be a discussion!
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:09:32
Are you an idiot? Of course you need to get both wife and husband to agree to a 4 figure investment.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:33:38
There hasnt been a drop, thats just volatility. Its been no more volatile than normal. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:13:47
And 2 months from now
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:49:57
So, if I want to conduct my daily business with bitcoin, can I? Can I pay my bills? Can i buy food? Pay at restaurants?
To the common person, it cannot be used as currency. To the cast majority of people, this is NOT a currency. It might be in the future, but it is not now. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:23:04
Ah, so to sell from coinbase, does going to gdax and selling there make sense then?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:25:08
I cant tell if you are a troll, 12 years old, just joking, or have clearly never been in a serious relationship. 
Ill assume the latter. When two people are in a serious relationship, large money decisions are made together. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:23:24


Almost none which matter to day to day life. 


I dont care about crime. 


Again, not really. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:38:38
So you want to be a prick and keep this guy far too invested? You are a cunt.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:52:04
Oh i see. :)
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:41:16
My circumstances aren't different. But the fact that you can't understand how a couple thousand bucks is a big deal for some people is really worrying. You must have lived in a bubble your entire life.
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:01:45
I am I'm the UK and have coin in coinbase. I've heard I can't sell through gdax in the UK. Is this true?
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:39:52
You should not be allowed to be incharge of your own money with financial management that poor...
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:54:36
There is no way that bitcoin returns are above any free allowance
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:42:22


Not to me, or as this thread suggest most people. Where the hell do you live that it isnt free to move money around your own accounts?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:41:15
That in a nutshell is the worst mistake anyone can ever  make when investing.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:18:19
What you bought it for makes no difference....
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:54:35
What can you use?
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:43:35
That is another sentence of utter horseshit. 
If you say something insane, thats fine, you NEED to back it up with facts though. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:10:27
Why? I cant use it as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:40:19
But it's been down like this before....
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:52:44
A post that mentions how you need to pay tax on that, which not everyone might know. Helpful. And Informative. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:31:59
Mind if I ask how old you are? This seems like stuff a teenager would say, or someone who has never been in a serious relationship
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:29:38
Yes, and there are thousands of those. You got lucky. No one is trying to take that away from you. But pretending otherwise is sitlly. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:49:03
You showed how in a niche situation you can use it to pay 1 particular bill. That is not the same. at all.
It is NOT currecntly a viable currency. This is not a discussion point, its a fact. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:47:18
Im not saying it will. YOU said you would ride it to zero if it went that way. Which from an investment point of view is utterly stupid. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:19:48
What you bought it for makes no difference. Why do people not understand this? It's like the most basic investment principal
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:32:57
Then it's especially odd that you can't understand how to be am adult.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:37:53
You honestly dont understand that for some people thousands of dollars is a large amount of money?
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:43:22
At the moment all it is is an investment. It is virtually unusuable as currency. 
It is an investment with not actual return like a dividend. It is 100% speculative. So the only thing propping it up is more people wanting to join. Thats a Pyramid Scheme. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:37:29
@_date: 2019-10-11 12:39:21
And that reason is tax evasion
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:52:39
Thats just not true. There are a lot of things I simply cannot do, that I pay someone for. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 07:11:25
I'm going to stop the conversation due to your last line. Anyone so up themselves they would say that clearly isn't interested in a grown up conversation.
@_date: 2018-04-23 21:54:45
Thats literally what a poll is. A lot of anecdotes. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 21:02:02
Yes, but to be fair youdve said the same thing at each spike. With bitcoin, invest or not investing isnt smarts, it literally luck. Its jsut gambling. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:05:18
Because I cannot use it to pay for things I need.
