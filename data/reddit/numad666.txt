gold is a tangible commodity that got its value out of its cultural appreciation and coincidental rarity...if you think gold is a bubble too i do agree with you but bitcoin is kind of bubble thats hard to sustain overtime could be due to increasing blockchains size or other technical aspect...being a tangible commodity gold doesnt fall in this category

You should read how fragile monetary economics are than some YouTube video. What you wrote is barter and it's not money, and it's a kind of bubble ;) peace :) 
As you spoke about printed money you are referring to M1 do a Google search you will find out M1 is not all the money and it's just tiny fraction and reason it's so expensive is bcoz it's expensive to run corporations and governments their costs can be reduced though

I am a programmer trust me I have worked on blockchains, so I know what I am talking about, its (conceptual)technology not monetary theory, for me money is legal commodity thats guaranteed its value by states or unions or organisations or by entity(its basic thing without this, it isnt money) and this is called M1 in monetary economics there are others forms of money too like deposits in banks, cheques, bonds, MOUs(even beads and stuff as you wrote) etc coz they can be exchanged for goods and services(they got value because the lender of these tools promise to pay the sum or the organisation thats backing this) so they come in later definitions of money as M2 M3 and so on...money can be theorised to commodity and a commodity can also be theorised also to money coz u can barter it, but it wont be accurate for more complex monetary economics....bcoz money will never loose its value it will always be same unit but its purchasing power reduces it might sound complex but commodity value can be decreased in barter so it cant pass for money purely.
For sake of argument I can consider Bitcoin as commodity(in reality its not commodity either if we do feel it as commodity then we are in grave economic sheet) its no way money coz it has no value, money should have a unit value or else its not money(you might say therez BTC and satoshi units but cmon its not real thing), real value of BTC is derived based on demand and supply(greed of modern financial markets if you can see it, its heading towards tulip mania type bubble), it be insanity to even consider bitcoin a commodity cause it not tangible good or has any usefulness in real terms as commodities does, its just some fancy token generated by some sophisticated (to make you happy) software.
Now you might say its very ethical currency coz its anonymous and decentralised, am so sure you know there are too many digital currencies these days and you should know not everyone are successful infact I can make my own by forking bitcoin or any other project or by using mutlichain blocks, here try to understand why there are too many digital currencies showing up, coz ppl saw the stupidity among people to exploit and you do have some significant financial incentives at early stage mining and again I am not saying Satoshi Nakamoto was after this. moreover you cant make money being alone(even a team with no broader representation) and call it money its insane.
Lets see another argument you want everyone to use Bitcoin(digital decentralised tokens of software) but it seems till now there is no participation of people in democratic way, you might not need a big brother but you need people's approval and democratic participation and later is too important seems everyone is ignoring this in Bitcoin ecosphere.
Without some formal representation and participation of people in democratic way in this form of money it cant be passed down for money and its just one senseless software token that being hyped as tulips of tulip mania, if you think people's participation is not required as long as its out of govt control, secured and decentralised and is fine if someone "ONE" person as  Satoshi Nakamoto can dictate our monetary policies for me it sounds too absurd of a statement.
Another thing which I cant wrap my head around why should I feel a non-tangible token generated by some software has value, isnt it insane? unless its legal or democratically represented. 
There is saying in my language(Urdu), hobbies die but traditions live, you need proper reliable timeless mechanism to be followed as money and make it a tradition, dont just pass any other thing as money its can prove fatal

for your 2nd and 3rd question it be extremely stupid if people shift to bitcoin that is nothing but just a software token writen by some dude...in perfect world I would expect some same kind of system with some fiscal backing as union by world goverments that would seem ideal condition for me...
Still if we consider everyone started using BTC and for sake argument we have 7,569,349.38BTC in circulations as per  with market cap 64,867,502,636.00USD consider $4042.92 for each BTC...now if everyone is using just BTC you have to represent world capitalisation in BTC alone we have 1.2quadrillion in derivatives and around 90trillion M1 adding stock markets and everything as per this blog  consider we have market cap of 1.2 quadrillion + 630 trillion that makes up 1,200,000,000,000,000+630,000,000,000,000 which brings to 1,830,000,000,000,000USD you have to represent all this wealth in BTC so each BTC should be 24176450.4204USD this is 597994.776553% increase in its current value all this considering ideal and healthy economic condition.
What happens to banking system banks cant regulate volume so the concept of inflation be changed and reversed to carrier of value(money) rather sticking with traditional commodities
I would love to see these in some ideal currency which could be accountable(i dont mean tracable to evade privacy though) so there wont be any wealth destruction and somewhat tangible and technological so that it wont be limited to technology limitations and speed to accomodate

its where we are today it can only be considered as commodity at the end you can also theorise money as commodity
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:35:53
I was referring figuratively to the founder still I should have known not to use figurative speech in this forum...so as per you a most critiqued and well written code generated tokens can pass for money....that sounds bit strange don't you think?
@_date: 2017-09-27 09:55:12
obvious markets are going to come down...have in mind bitcoin is just some e token which sits on P2P network and whats its value? nothing jut as FIAT currency if you feel its worth you pay for it and in turn it got its value in any case P2P tokens(bitcoins) should come down and its pretty much a bubble as tulip mania
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:10:07
I am really surprised why you ignored all my points and picked my only figurative statement to comment 
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:57:29
I can't really agree to any of your points... you are assuming Bitcoin as a thing first it has to be understood that it's just an etoken not commodity or money...you just had one valid point that's  Bitcoin is out of government control sure you are right over there...but here remind yourself again Bitcoin is nothing but a token generated by a software...govts don't need to block internet to stop Bitcoin they can just make it criminal offense to exchange Bitcoin for money goods and services it will bring down Bitcoin value(present sense less wind trade value as in tulip mania)
But some how still some stupid ppl started feeling its valuable and accepted it as barter for their products or services, as this insanity is going on, then stepped in financial markets to exploit and make quick bucks(here is where it got serious and it's no way healthy)
You also should consider ECB(European Central Bank) is starting it's own blockchain currency so is China India Netherlands I would respect them as currencies coz they are backed by monetary policies which is real economy
This tulip mania insanity is going too big I really wonder why ppl are romanticising too much gimmick economy it's not sustainable

I am programmer and a trader...just explain me this... why should I consider some token generated by a software as money and has value...its revolutionary I agree with you but only if its democratic and represented by masses not just some software community I wrote one long essay on why its not money and why it can qualify for commodity and why not....just go through it you will have your answeres....paying in commodities is not absurd idea few economists might argue barter system is one simple and more adapt and its from that we got concept of money which is just certificate of promising commodity in its return to ricever by lender
another big bubble is ICO of digital currencies its vast subject please google it and according some studies futures contracts that are being signed in these trades cant be completed with bitcoin(anyway this be case even with gold and many other commodities that are trader in futures and options market)
Am happy that you got paid in bitcoins but it surprises me why arent you afraid of price fluctuations of it last weeks it dropped its value around 1500USD and now it might gone back to recover some of it, are you just going to ignore this volatility? Now you might say foreign exchange is prone to this volatility but I will tell you it wont effect you personally it only effects banks, big corporates but here this volatility will effect you coz you be living in this volatility coz your country doesnt have BTC as principle currency so you are forced to go through this pain and its absurd
And again I ask you to read my last comments completely and try understanding those complex economic theories and principles 
After you read and completely understood just tell me whats the value of bitcoin(if you say demand and supply lemme tell you dont fuck domestic monetary policies with forex concept of volatilities economies get fucked up so bad and serious), and why I should consider a random token generated by a software as money, I am programmer if I want I can make those tokens my own or even make my own money? so you want everyone has their own money? now you are flirting with primitive barter system with crazy complex forex style monetary policies I have no words to describe it
@_date: 2017-09-19 09:54:23
here one must understand what is money and definition of money, its not like gold is currency but it had its appeal to civilisations thus it got its place for its appreciation and equating that to Bitcoin is part of gimmick economy bubble that we are trending these days....at the end what is bitcoin its just a token generated by some software and completely depended on this same software network architecture(with no real peg with anyother object to derive its value rather value is being derived out of speculation purely) thus it might not qualify for the definition of money....more over why is this software generated token is valuable and what characteristics does it have? none just the greed of traders and economists to make money out of gimmick economy...
@_date: 2017-09-27 11:22:44
am sure you can solve all those tech issues still it sounds extremely stupid and absurd to rely on some vague tokens like BTC in perfect world I expect this to be backed by proper banking systems of the world as one union or to least if they least adopt BTC as union and trash rest FIAT currency...but here we are starting a brad new monetory economics apart from FIAT...
@_date: 2017-09-19 09:48:00
just out of curiosity any idea how can I make my own payment gateway for bitcoin and other blockchain systems? i am sorry but I am completely new to this ecosphere 
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:15:57
personally speaking i cant understand why should we consider a randomly e generated e token by some random dude as commodity let alone it be money....i agree this what central banks do creating money out of nothing but still they are representation of people and democracy...all this sums up to just one to me a tulip mania type exotic bubble...
