no, even if a lot of people are getting in to just get rich there are still many more that are getting in and learning about it that would not have had it not been so hyped. plus on a global scale there is still only a very small percentage of people that are involved. The growth will be exponential which is partly why it seems so inflated but the publicity will only benefit in the long run.

It depends on the alt because they are paired with BTC.  There’s some alts that are up compared to BTC and some that are down.

The USD is insured by the FDIC up to 250k but they are also insured for all of their crypto by someone else. The only thing is I think it only covers the liquid currencies which is only the 2% so if anything happens to the cold storage they’re screwed I believe

Probably not enough after fees for the exchange

Best tip on HODL: put your bitcoin in a safe place, then delete everything. all news about crypto, all tickers, anyone that wants to talk about it shut it out. come back years later. profit.

definitely bad stories, but you also have to take into account the amount of volume they deal with. truthfully all of the horror stories you have heard are barley a blip of their user base. they have roughly 12 million users adding like 2-300k a week. also when you read about experiences online the majority of them will be negative because they are frustrated people that want to voice their frustration.

if these are the questions you are still asking then i suggest you do more research for a while because you're not ready. especially if every dollar counts for tuition.

Dude actually read what you posted. You just proved my point.

You must be using bing or something cuz google has a completely different answer and it has nothing to do with withdrawing or depositing 5k. It’s about money laundering or terrorist financing suspicion or illegal activities. Don’t post fake news.

probably with coinbase, and maybe a few other exchanges. i just know i have a good weekly limit for me on coinbase and despite their fees i have not had any bad experiences with them.

If you go by what Coinbase says they keep 98% of their currency in cold storage and they are also insured which is a plus. It’s safer than what a lot of people make it seem but at the end of the day the safest place is in your hands. Just not convenient if you actively trade.

I’m not saying bitcoin is the future or will have widespread adoption, but god damn your logic is retarded at best. You’re comparing it to a fucking useless flower. And just because it’s a bubble doesn’t mean it’s gone. It takes years to decades for something like this to be adopted. Take apple for example. Started in 1976, crashed to $6 in 2000 with the dot com “bubble”. It was around 24 years until one of its lowest points, 10+ more until it really started taking off and becoming one of the top tech companies. It’s been maybe 10 years since bitcoin started. All a bubble means is knocking out the weaker companies and starting the real work. The dot com bubble gave birth to some of the mega companies we have today and that holds true to almost every bubble besides the fucking useless ones like flowers.

So buying shares of a company or a commodity as a raw material for a product in hopes that the value will increase is different than buying bitcoin or gold in hopes for the value to increase are two different things? Get real. Don’t say stupid shit. All of your examples are of investments and all of them are speculation. Some will be more stable investments with less speculation and some are less stable with more speculation but they are all alike.
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:58:20
Yea you should rethink that, all that article says is Coinbase doesn’t have to give your info. YOU still have to file taxes. You’re not going to get caught now but if you ever want to take your money out into fiat and you’ve made a substantial amount they are going to want documentation on how you accumulated that money. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:29:56
Again I’m not arguing that. But by definition bitcoin is an investment and buying Apple shares is still speculative. They are on different ends of the spectrum of safety and risk but it’s still a fact that those terms apply to both. People just throw around terminology without knowing what they mean. If I read a thread, whether it be negative or positive, what makes you think I’ll take you seriously if you can’t even use the terminology correctly? 
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:25:06
Then maybe I’m mistaken but he’s saying move the decimal. And we do make it easier by saying Sats. He’s not saying anything different than what’s already being used. If you say kilo say any average person will know you’re saying 1000 satoshi. I just fail to see the value of this post.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:58:13
I wasn’t disagreeing with that, just that you’re using investment and speculation wrong. Just because it’s nothing doesn’t mean you’re not investing and just because it’s something doesn’t mean it’s not speculation. Feel me cuz?

Its more of a currency than a fuckin tulip dipshit. It offers value, tulips don’t offer anything. It took 8 years for the euro to be adopted by 13 countries and after 19 years is just now at 22. Even more, the idea of the euro had been around since the 60s and just wasn’t implemented until 1999. So 30+ years until it became accepted as a legitimate currency. These things don’t happen overnight.
Edit: like I said bitcoin might not be the one adopted but it has a higher chance than any other crypto. Contrary to what you believe, Crypto-currency is most likely going no where and there will eventually be a global currency. Just so happens that with technology these days crypto makes the most sense.

Ok so why didn’t any other exchange announce it? Guess they all work together huh. Maybe you should ask why your bank didn’t tell you they were changing their policy?
@_date: 2018-02-21 03:01:53
I can guarantee you it will go as low as it is going to go before it goes back up and then it’ll go back down etc.

That credit card fee has been there forever it even says it when you buy any of their crypto. Banks decided to charge cash advance fees to all exchanges.

@_date: 2018-02-12 14:42:57
In my opinion kilo sats is still too cumbersome. If you really want to make it easy then you create something in between bitcoin and satoshi. Bitcoin being gold, satoshi being change, then you have (       )  Being the dollars. Equaling like 100 or 1000 satoshies. Preferably a one syllable word.  He didn’t change unit terminology he just used the shortcut for 1000 (kilo). It’s just not something revolutionary to me.

You are mistaken. Losses are counted in no matter what and they are not counted as property.
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:29:06
Fair enough. First I’ve really heard it, just not mainstream enough. The problem with a bit though is that it’s not even worth a penny. There really needs to be a dollar equivalent.
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:46:17
Really? “That will be 12 kilo-satoshi” vs “that will be 12 bits” which would you rather say?
@_date: 2018-02-23 23:29:58
What makes you think Coinbase was notified? They probably didn’t know until everyone started complaining about it.
@_date: 2018-02-23 21:35:58
Coinbase doesn’t owe you anything it’s not their fault your bank decided to charge you.
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:34:15
Oh, I agree with that, kilo sat is not the way to go I was choosing between the two choices. There needs to be a short succinct word that equates close to a dollar in value for it to be feasible. I don’t think bit is the answer either. It’s different than hecta dollar in the sense that it’s not so cumbersome and flows easily when it’s going to be used so much in any given day.
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:07:58
This makes zero sense. Bitcoin is a finite amount you cannot just move the decimal point and if you’re just talking about in speaking terms then people already do this which is the point of saying sat which is to get rid of the decimal. Also “two hundred seventy seven million kilo sats” would be 277,000,000,000 satoshi not 277,000,000. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:40:10
Wait, do you think bitcoin is non seizable?
