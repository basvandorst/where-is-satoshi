On Bittrex they call them wallets.  SEC is Safe Exchange Coin or SAFEX on certain exchanges.  The wallets are segregated by addresses so I just happened to grab the wrong address in my copy and paste.

It was the exchange (Bittrex) "wallet" address.  Each coin is in a separate wallet and I grabbed the SEC wallet address instead of the BTC wallet address when I went to move the funds from my GDAX account.  So after it didn't show up for 5 minutes I started looking at and to my horror I discovered my error.  I asked a friend, but he said that he'd never considered the possibility so none of us know definite answers unfortunately.

Thank you for the clarification.  Would the keys be the same for the address regardless of the currency at that address?  As in would the exchange hold the keys to it if they have the keys to the SEC coin I currently hold at that address?

Thank you so much.  I submitted a support ticket.  I was hoping if I lost access to it that at least it had a chance to make it to a less fortunate person perhaps in another country that could really benefit from it.   It's a little disheartening to think if Bittrex can't solve it then there'll be one Bitcoin in infinite HODL mode.

Do you think the odds may be decent that the exchange would hold multiple sets of keys per address?  
Seriously thank you for sharing your knowledge!
