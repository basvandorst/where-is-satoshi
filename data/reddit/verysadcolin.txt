God bless fuckin America

I mean, hey, you can embody the American spirit from Europe, kiwi brother. That was the most inspiring paragraph, as I keep reading it I'm genuinely feeling fuller and happier. No shame, no secret, this is who you are and what you did and anyone who doesnt like it can pound sand.

Absolutely, man.

It has no value, except for all the value it has by being a way to have an immutable way to perform peer to peer transactions worldwide (relatively) quickly.

I know we all want to be jillionaires, I do, but if you don't believe in the future of decentralization, these are gonna be bumpy times. It's gonna seem bad sometimes like it does this weekend, and people get emotional when their money is involved, but try to look objectively. We're still in very early phases, and the schemers will go, and the vision and the real coins will remain. I believe, I'll always believe.

Yeah, I mean maybe there would be, but wouldn't there be insufficient liquidity if everyone pulled their USD out at the same time for cash, too? Like its just a silly, fluffy statement, right? Same as when people talk about crypto as criminal currency, like regular old money hasn't been used like that for millennia

Welcome. I bought litecoin at 88, ether at 380.. This shit happens... A lot. I think if you're A. Not willing to lose what you invested, or B. Not well equipped to handle the stress, you should just put it away on a hardware wallet, and come back in a year or two and see where we're at:) it'll all be okay, man. 
We're a ways off of mainstream adoption. Bankers are still laughing, governments are still confused; it'll be a while yet before cause for extreme concern, imho.

This dude's middle name is Beauregard; I take no shit from someone named Beauregard. He eats tapioca pudding for every dessert and probably thinks the dark web is what happens when someone turns on f.lux

There's a tool in mspaint to make straight lines, I know there is.

That's the fun thing about appointed positions. He's fucking perfect for both D and R cronyism. D's get to stir the pot, talk him down, gain following and still benefit, and Rs get to say they cracked down on "crime", or whatever.

A total lack of understanding and saltiness that none of THEIR investments hit our kind of gains or even close to it this year

FOMO, and being a newbie. That, and I had my first significant expendable capital in literally years. I've been working basically only hourly jobs my entire life, I happened to fall into a bit of cash, and my eyes got big.
 Since then I basically eat, sleep and breathe news, I've learned a ton, and I won't repeat that sort of mistake.

It's such a funny argument, because, as you say, fiat is total nothing. Fiat is just code and paper, just like bitcoin is. I literally don't understand how these analysts can go and say, "wow, they just created money" like the fed doesn't do that every single year hahaha

Oh, I'm definitely still working. From that first go, I lost a (relatively) large amount of money. I definitely haven't hit the lambo zone, far from it. Through I have made a bit, trading is.. Kinda tough, to be real with you. 
The fees kind of stack up; it's not like I came into hundreds or even dozens of thousands, so trading the tiny dips just isn't profitable most of the time. 
The little chunks I have made came from educated guesses and patterns on limit sells/buys. As a guy above pointed out, eth has been steady at 300ish, and litecoin hangs around 55, around 8 30 am MST is usually the peak of a bull day... Your mileage may vary. Good luck man, we're gonna get there. I'm just gonna keep throwing my checks at it, too:)

I understand that he's been a senator, but in a deeply red state. In a national vote for AG, I buy it a lot less. But we don't get to do that, we just have to take it. And sure, neither you or I are violating any laws.... As of now.

I don't like the idea that ANY President or governor can appoint positions, to be clear. And theoretically means exactly that. I'm not saying likely, or even that I think it'll happen at all. It's possible, in some world in the near or distant future. I don't know how or why, I'm not a psychic.
 I don't know why you're asking for "evidence", as if I'm saying that I actually think that'll happen. I don't. Either way, have a good day. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:26:19
Yeah, I mean, I'm being pretty brash and hyperbolic for a guy who could, theoretically, be thrown in prison someday just for owning crypto. But I don't like the guy, and can't think of anyone except the old money cliques who does. Also, fuck all appointed positions. No way would this guy have made it into office had it come to a vote.

It happens, man. My alts still haven't recovered from the beginning of September

The low amounts likely won't be a big deal. I absolutely agree that if you have thousands on the line, keeping them on coinbase or gdax or bittrex or whatever isn't correct, but if it's less than a hundred? 
They'll more than likely honor you for good, unless somehow bitcoin has, like, a quadrillion dollar market cap someday, or something.
