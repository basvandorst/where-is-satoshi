Thank you for your reply and yes internet is the king. But being more specific, do you think that it makes sense to learn via codeacademy or find free tutorials?

Shhhh... that’s secret info man. Don’t let it out. ����

How would you suggest one does that when coming from absolute zero knowledge about it. Like are there any tutorials/resources you could share? Where does one start? How long does it take?

This shows up just when I am totally out of "get smart drugs". :(

So there are exactly 24 words in the white area that appear only once in the white paper and are also in bip039. Does this make any sense?

It is funny how they call it "Virtual Currencies". 
For the last ***kin time, these are CRYPTO currencies and there is nothing virtual about them. They are all as real as it gets you media people. Please get your vocabulary right and the stigma has to stop.

Sorry I edited my last comment but you are right.

They were playing with fire, trying to fuk with the price; now see them burn. 
Bitcoin is a non-tameable animal, try to tame it and see how that ends.

I feel you, bro.

I thought that it was representative of USD value and just that. However, I have been seeing some shit about these Tether stuff. Gotta go read up on it.

Well, since you asked, buy via dollar cost averaging, take out initial investment and some profits, when you hit your moon and HODL the rest.

Well take that piss and fuck your mom with it.

Your opinion resonates with a lot of us here.

What is the difference between USDT and USD? :/

Sorry mate, my bad.

We got a meme for a president man, alas. Worry not, rest of the world will follow soon as usual.

There are employers out there who will give you 3-6 months salary up front if you are willing to do the grind. So I guess that would solve your problem. Once you have a job, then banks will also loan you money or give you a credit card to drown in debt. So I guess that will also solve your problem.

Sounds all glamorous until you actually have to do it. However, a pro tip, don’t sell your laptop.

I agree but the article speaks of Crypto Currencies while referring to them as Virtual currencies; which is plainly unacceptable.

Like a well composed (cropped) screenshot every night into a time lapse. Or could just code a ticker to emulate the same.

The videos were still square (read 4:3). Only Satoshi was HODLing from back then. Only if...

If you did that from the days of "Interloper", you would be beyond moon right now. But we gotta buy them dreams to survive in this emotionless world. :P

Get a job. Really. Then you can buy your own bitcoin. ��

This is naiceeee!!! 
Just noticed that you make a lot of crypto related art. Always good to see artists entering this space. :) 
And your cat as rad as your art. ����

Hey buddy, you might wanna hope for something plausible.

last time market cap was this high, we hit 20k in 3 weeks. ;)
@_date: 2019-05-03 12:42:33
haha, IMHO it was confirmed by the golden cross and the close above the 21 EMA on the monthly charts. ;)
