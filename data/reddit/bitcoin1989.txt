Thank you very much, very kind of you to be so patient as to fully explain the situation to me and also as a neutral party (not involved in coding).

I understand what these posts are trying to do, but it doesn't come across how  you think it does. You're trying to say to weak hands, don't buy Bitcoin if you can't hold it, but saying it in a riddle such that the kind of people you are targeting will simply not understand.
If you want to tell people "Only buy Bitcoin if you're prepared to hold through crashes", then you should just say it. Because these posts, firstly, don't make any logical sense (no one that has ever held Bitcoin has ever lost anything, in spite of what your post implies), they come across as condescending but worst of all as though you are sincerely warning people away from Bitcoin....then having the Bitcoin community agree with your unwarranted sentiment.
It is like reverse marketing, and frankly, it is idiotic given the number of new comers that will be arriving on this forum right now that don't have a clue about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:23:19
Except.... people tell you to do what they are doing, not the opposite. 
"I've invested 1mil in gold, but you shouldn't because its not a good idea..."
Sounds realistic /s.
"Investing in gold is the best thing, everyone's doing it, tell all your friends to do it too".

Ok, well, I already know I'm correct and it really does not matter what you say or what the 'lawyer' you ask *thinks* that he/she knows.
But if you are genuinely interested then contact a money laundering specialist lawyer, because I know you didn't. A little short sighted asking someone who doesn't know about a subject, don't you think? 
I guess it will be pretty embarrassing watching that lawyer backtrack when you do ask someone that knows what they're talking about. 
Ask them the following "if I intentionally avoid bank triggers to move a large some of money through a bank, will I get in trouble for structuring". 
This stuff is not complicated and there is NO QUESTION about what I am saying. People like you are so full of themselves that they pretend they know things to the point they are arguing with people on the internet about subjects that they know nothing about. It is incredibly immature.

Can you please explain how bigger blocks is a "take over attempt", when it is the original vision for up-scaling Bitcoin?

So presumably you are against cash for the same reason and you therefore want only centralized methods of owning currency/commodities that you therefore have no real ownership or possession of? 
Yeh, give up your rights of ownership and centralize everything to "fight criminals". You are your governments dream, not very bright.
...Or you didn't realize that criminals would obviously have an easier time using cash over Bitcoin in terms of untraceability considering there is a central ledger for Bitcoin and no such thing with Cash and so did not realize that your statement implies the above... Not too bright. Sorry.
@_date: 2017-02-12 16:17:34
Haha you are really stupid aren't you kid? Your problem is you don't read, you just argue.
I said if you break up the payments specifically to beat automatic banking reports it is called structuring/smurfing and illegal and that this will get you under investigation and can lead to the money being confiscated if you cannot provide satisfactory evidence of the origin.
So you, the little genius, decide to post a link to refute what I've said - calling me a "fucking idiot" - that actually proves EXACTLY what I was saying to be TRUE! They are even using the exact terminology I used and were explaining it in the same way I did.
You couldn't make this up!!
EXCEPT, in the incident you linked to, just because the payments happened to be below 10,000USD they were accused of structuring and actually had the money CONFISCATED even though the origin of the funds were PROVABLE. They had to go to court and get the judgement over-turned to get their money back!
Now, I capitalized some words here to help you follow what was being said more easily. Also, doing so will hopefully catch the eye of more people and give them a  heads up to write off anything they ever see from you in the future as more complete and utter rubbish.

It is a proposed solution for bitcoin's scaling issue, how - in your mind -  is that not relevant to a bitcoin reddit?!
It seems our mind has been made up for us on this issue, that is not ok and very suspect. If segwit is such better code why aren't we allowed to see it for ourselves?
Ive been pro segwit up to now, this realization proves that might have been purely because it was secretly forced on me by this subs moderation.
@_date: 2017-02-28 12:47:08
So, we have two valid solutions that are being blocked by the creators of the other.
This is why Mike Hearn quit, its an unbelievably immature frankly embarrassing situation.

I'm not technical enough to be able to assess pieces of code myself, I don't even pretend to know enough about the options well *enough* to decide for myself or attempt to convince anyone else. I am ignorant and trusting all those who understand this fully to negotiate the best path.
It just strikes me as a non-level playing field the second authorities in the community restrict speech about the options, irrespective of how crap a solution they may be.
The only argument from BU that I've understood is that Segwit is risking centralization, it is code that has been pushed by a particular company and is essentially just a new coin.
I wouldn't know if this was true or not, but the fact that there does appear to be active manipulation going on kind of makes it look like it could be true and there is a collective/centralized effort to push a particular thing through.
@_date: 2017-02-26 20:59:52
Maybe I was heavy handed. But below:-
"..with an average fee of $1.73 per transaction. Most transactions took over 12 hours to clear."
I've never had a fee over 50c and never had a transaction take longer than an hour. So to me this seems completely unbelievable. 
@_date: 2017-02-11 15:39:37
I doubt the ETF is having any impact on price right now, why would it? 
It has been reported to have a less than 30% chance of approval and if it isn't approved there could even be a minor drop in the price temporarily. 
So why would people be buying in solely because of that, on the basis of the above?

Why has this been up voted? It is a load of rubbish.
It is just someone from Reddit who knows you have Bitcoin and has doxxed you because you are so naive you use your real name on an internet board. They also think your are naive enough to take this seriously...as you have done.
Just for one little second, think about this, imagine you know someone well enough in real life to know they have twins. Don't you think you'd know some other details you could use to scare the person with?
If they knew you in real life, they'd know what car you drove, where you lived (from following you home), what your wife looked like, the names of all your family members but most importantly they would have PHOTOS of them that THEY took to send to you so you took the threat seriously. 
How about this for a ransom:-
"Hi, you live at &gt;&gt;your address&lt;&lt; and you drive a car with this license plate &gt;&gt;license plate&lt;&lt;. 
These are photos I took of your wife with your twins, within the last 24hrs:-"
Then asked you for 20BTC.
THEN you'd have a real situation to contact the police about.
But THIS, and THESE responses from idiots on r/Bitcoin are just ridiculous and clearly everyone taking this seriously is as painfully naive  as yourself (feel free to read naive as "not very bright" in this post).
@_date: 2017-02-28 09:04:43
Yeh, this is what I realised yesterday. There is an 'attack' on the original vision of bitcoin and its coming from core developers.
The thing I don't understand now is if there is an ulterior motive to move bitcoin from its original vision or if in doing so you get a better version of bitcoin.....which obviously i'd support.
@_date: 2017-02-27 13:19:31
I'm writing from a position of someone supporting Segwit.
Am I misunderstanding the following:-
1.) The original vision for Bitcoin scaling was to increase block size, nothing more nothing less?
2.) If yes to the above, why does it suddenly need to be different from this?
3.) If the answer to number to is essentially because HF is more risky and they are better developers for Segwit, then is it not only more risky to HF because there's now a lot of people that don't want it?
4.) Therefore, if the only reason the original scaling solution has become dangerous is because Segwit is being pushed as a possible solution and the HF is contentious - then why was Segwit developed in the first place? Developing it has potentially ruined Bitcoin by being the sole cause of this argument?
I have to admit, it looks like a load of new developers have come out of nowhere and decided they know what Bitcoin should be and have split the community from the original vision of Bitcoin.

Make a new thread. I noticed this too, Bloomberg have colluded in price manipulation.
@_date: 2017-02-26 09:57:35
Fiat IS slave money and has been since they made it centralized. Removing cash on the basis of "convenience" in order "fight crime" has always been the agenda after that, to create a slave population. It is such a simple and logical progression to get total control over your country's population.
Think of it like this, ultimately you can own NOTHING without your governments approval, but you BELIEVE you live in a "free" society. Every single person to person transaction will be accounted for and monitored. 
Want to sell your spare tires to your neighbor for 100 bucks? Get ready to have the transaction scrutinized. Didn't keep record of where you got 100USD? Now it is the government's money and you get a fine. 
This is already happening, it is just a question if Bitcoin will become popular enough in time to throw a spanner in the works of global elites because cash will be GONE in Western Countries within 10 years at the rate things are changing.
@_date: 2017-02-08 20:48:10

Because it isn't a scaling solution, its a load of unneeded changes to Bitcoins code that provide a very temporary fix. After its implemented there will probably still need to be a hard fork to bigger blocks.
Because it is not how bitcoin was intended to scale, the creator of bitcoin said blocks would get bigger in order to scale and that was what had always been done up to this point. Why should it suddenly change because blockstream says it should?
We know bigger blocks hard forked is safe, we don't know if changing the basic code of bitcoin is safe.

I had a little thought and realized that this is such basic law that I don't actually believe you asked a real Lawyer. Any real Lawyer would know the definition of structuring. Or, the Lawyer you asked is a complete and utter negligent and clueless IDIOT.
For anyone reading this that is foolish enough to trust what this child is saying please see the below. It is totally basic and available from Wikipedia so it is accessible to anyone to confirm:-
"Structuring, also known as smurfing in banking industry jargon, is the practice of executing financial transactions (such as the making of bank deposits) in a specific pattern calculated to avoid the creation of certain records and reports required by law, such as the United States' Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and Internal ..."
The OP was suggested to put it all in an exchange then send to his bank, the OP correctly acknowledged that this would get his account frozen (this is due to a SAR report).
The person who made the original suggestion then said to break the payments up into chunks of 1000USD so that it would not trigger any automatic alert in the bank.
The process of doing that is the EXACT definition of structuring and it is a criminal offence under money laundering acts as you can see from the quote above.
Again, to anyone actually interested, feel free to look up the specifics of these money laundering laws and confirm what wikipedia is saying. As though anyone needs to make such a confirmation in order refute anything coming from someone like Edict_18.

They are literally telling their population "Yes we think Bitcoin is a great idea and yes we have been trying to stifle its growth while we developed our own version. But please note we will remove all the features of Bitcoin that drew you to it in the first place....but now we have made you (the entire population) aware of digital currency make sure not to use Bitcoin, the globally recognized popular original version, use our crap centralized version instead."
How shortsighted.

I've seen a quote somewhere of Satoshi saying to increase blocksize to up-scale. So that was the original plan, I therefore cannot change this point.
The point from BU is what gives anyone the right to change the inner workings of the code, it is a point that cannot be disputed as it is an ideological perspective. I later mentioned the reason why it is being changed, to fix the malleability issue. Nothing needs to be changed on that basis.
Thank you, I will add that into the OP so the numbers are known.
If hardforking is not safe with respect to backwards compatible nodes why was it not a problem for all the other hard-fork block size increases?

The real reason it was introduced is because criminals making money hide their crime.
The only evidence of crime then becomes the presence of the money itself.
Therefore by simply switching the presumption of innocence to the presumption of guilt, the responsibility because the suspect to prove how he made that money.
If he cannot prove with independent and verifiable evidence how the funds were procured, the funds are deemed to be from criminal activity and you will have them confiscated.
I had an argument on here recently with some idiot who didn't understand this concept.
Basically, the nature of Bitcoin means we are almost all money launders and liable to have ANY funds confiscated that originate from Bitcoins should you ever be investigated if you cannot prove EVERY step of the way.

Let me get this straight. You were expecting that in spite of everyone on earth that knows what Bitcoin is knew the SEC were going to make an announcement and all planned to sell at the same time if it was negative. 
You thought there would be an equal number of people BUYING at that moment to fill you in your order right away?
If you check the volume, the entire day consisted of barely a few bitcoins being sold or bought at all.
Please let me know if I'm missing something here, i.e maybe the exchanges provide the liquidity to these orders (DOUBT IT).

You are just over dramatizing this and it has no benefit to anyone. Anyone saying the above does not understand anything about this situation either if they are being serious. 
This is two groups of people heavily invested in Bitcoin that want it to succeed and have millions upon millions of their own investment riding on Bitcoin's success. With so much emotion (money) behind the options available they want the BEST for Bitcoin and therefore hold strong opinions.

It has NOTHING TO DO WITH INTENT, get that into your head, you will get your funds frozen even without intent! 
One last time for you in simple sentences:-
In this circumstance, with this sum of money, using the means of transfer noted.
By moving the money in such a way that avoids AML controls.
Will get your account frozen pending investigation.
If they find you did this, with the original sum intact.
It is legally deduced you took this line of action.
To avoid the AML controls.
You have committed a crime under Money Laundering laws.
You must prove otherwise in court.
Moving 1000USD of 500,000USD each day into your bank account through coinbase is structuring.
You will likely get your money confiscated if you do this.
I am so fed up of arguing with people like you who insult when they realize they are wrong. I hope no one knows this account and you in real life because you absolutely look ridiculous and have been embarrassing yourself throughout this exchange.
For the record, I am not a bank teller. I am a professional trader and I have studied financial and money laundering laws for YEARS.
So for the last time accept you're wrong and try learning something today instead of pretending you know everything already, because its pathetic.

The network is not broken if it cannot "handle" major spam attacks, it is just yet to upgrade. Right now Bitcoin is on the precipice of a new bull run while there is a back-log of transactions that is not TOO disruptive yet. To come and spam the system is very high risk right now and it should not be welcome.
We do not need issues, already known, to be highlighted right now if they can potentially disrupt market sentiment during this crucial time. 
Anyone that thinks otherwise is plain ignorant. Do these stress tests in a few months after price has established a significant base above 1000USD. 
I just hope it doesn't have much of an impact and we don't get a load of complaints about how bad the system is suddenly, that the media pick up on and write about and that then influences the ETF decision.

Yeh the CIA own everyone's computer and can control everything, that's how they get no information leaked themselves and never have huge embarrassing scandals.....said no one ever.
If Isis or another terror group ever actually go for USA one day, it will become very apparent how useless the cia and your secret service really is.
There is a prank on youtube that highlights this perfectly, some uk comedian outsmarted your secret service and threw swastika marked golf balls around Donald trump recently. They wanted to interview him to find out how he did it....honestly a ten year old could have worked it out.
Another one, when the cia tried to over throw Erdogan in Turkey recently, they told the jet pilots which hotel he was in to go assassinate him. Counter intelligence from Russia told him cia's plan so he left and survived. The cia really isn't what you americans think it is.

@_date: 2017-03-26 10:50:38
Finally we are making progress. BUT can someone please bring some publicity to the fact that Segwit, requiring 95% support will NEVER activate!!!
So seriously, what is the real plan for scaling???????? BU only exists because how else do we move forward? Wait for months for segwit to get rejected organically, then what??????????
Come on people THINK, when does this actually move forward? If its USAF lets get that moving now!!!

I'm genuinely sorry to hear your legal family misled you on that issue, assuming you asked them.
P.S As I already told you I'm not a bank teller, I'm a professional trader. That means I'm far more qualified to talk about how a market will be affected per this current discussion.

@_date: 2017-03-05 12:25:42
I felt the same way, but I got to the point where I felt duty bound to try and work out - based on their OWN arguments - which was a better option.
That's what the "The normal persons explanation of the blocksize debate" thread I made was about, it collatated all the valid arguments from both side and then as new information was found points were "mooted" and no longer valid in the argument. In the end it looked like there was a counter argument for all of BU's points and it looks like Segwit is the clear winner - and that was based on their OWN arguments from each side.
This was in R/BTC and here, so there is no manipulation or censorship, it is just cold hard truths. I don't think there is any reason for people to just stay ignorant like you are suggesting when threads like that exist.
I actually found myself switching support from one to the other as I learned more, in the end, people stopped submitting - i.e no one had anything more to add. I even edited requesting more support for BU, that edit is still there but nothing more came after days for BU. Then I made up my mind, Segwit is CLEARLY the better option right now, there is no question about it.

Their idea is to have market determined blocksize consensus, that is what they are working towards...if they were able to achieve this without risks of miner control we'd have the ideal solution. probably better than cores vision, because Bitcoin would stay how it works now...with Lightning networks we will have to rely on a new actor, 'hubs' to process transactions, which is a new point of failure and another group of people that will try to take excessive control.

@_date: 2017-03-14 15:50:10
Can someone please explain what i'm misunderstanding, if Bitmain had 60pc of the hash power they could commandeer a hardfork today. Then core would be left without the hash power to cope with the high difficulty stalling the core system.
Why would core users then sell their coins on the fork that was so non functional at that time. Why any company try to work with the fork that was so slow to get confirmations?
Please tell me i'm missing something here, anyone could singlehandedly destroy the price of bitcoin for weeks and weeks if that have the hashpower...it was never meant to be that a single entity would have so much hash power. All they need is an economic incentive, or for the government to force them to do it.

"The Lightning Network failure scenario described by Todd, takes place when a large number of people on the Bitcoin network need to settle their Lightning Network disputes on the blockchain in a relatively short period of time."
"What Are the Possible Solutions?
Any situation that allows for coins to be stolen obviously needs to be avoided and according to Todd, there are some theoretical solutions available for this problem. For one, an adaptive block size limit could allow miners to increase capacity in these sorts of failure scenarios."
Adaptive blocksize is the only viable solution presented for failure mode of LN. So yeh, you had no idea about this, clearly.....who is ignorant? Lol.

I think it should be more straight forward to run a node, all this pruning and raspberry pie stuff is too much.
I'm a professional trader, live off of bitcoin, savings in only bitcoin know every detail of the block size debate and the prospect of having go through a guide to set this up makes it too much bother. Its not a matter of can I do it.
There should be a sticky at the top of the sub saying something like 'download this and have a node running in minutes, signal your support now'.
It should be that simple, until someone makes running a node accessible to normal people the number of nodes being run will never show its true potential and any signalling will always be done by the fringes of the bitcoin community.
Call it lazyness but i'm making a point that perfectly representative of many users.

You are deluded, 'The winning fork I’m defining here as the longest bitcoin chain (measured by amount of “work” or hashing power done on it)'.
It is standard to define the longest chain as having the most work.
... and what decides which chain gets the most work? Market consensus? Everyone on one fork sells, price drops on one fork raises on the other? All the miners switch to the higher priced fork? I.e the market decided the path of bitcoin? Lol, you are unbelievable that you are even trying to argue this point. I really hope this gets picked up on by others. Unbelievably ignorant.

BU is more like Bitcoin is now than Cores vision of Bitcoin. Didn't you know that? There's plenty of information for you to read to confirm this.
I'm also a supporter of Lightning network, but it is just ignorant to pretend that LN and segwit resembles our current bitcoin more than BU does.
BU is bitcoin exactly as it is now but with market determined blocksize, that is literally its only change I've found. Segwit changes the way bitcoin behaves on a fundamental level and LN changes the very core fundamental principle of Bitcoin which is not having to rely on third parties.
It seems strange that as a developer you aren't aware of these key differences.
@_date: 2017-03-29 15:44:05
Thanks...my kind of guide lol.
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:53:58
LOL BU is decentralizing control? 
By decentralizing, do you mean centralizing the power to any miner with more than 5% of the hash power to be able to completely disrupt the network using the median attack? 
An attack that has no real defense and is immediately implementable upon launch of BTU?
@_date: 2017-03-31 10:18:19
Hm, I think it was a good presentation to be honest. 
Core seem to be saying high fees are needed to pay the miners as that's the only way to secure the network, why not just MORE smaller fees from a more popular Bitcoin? Given that some of the biggest miners in the industry support bigger blocks it seems odd to pretend this is a valid argument?
This presentation, while some are mocking, will be showing many people important details. Me for example, I'm back on the fence.
This whole business with AXA funding blockstream screams corruption. Their interests seem to conflict on a basic level.

I'm invested in Bitcoin because of a lot of things, mostly now because of the infrastructure built around it and its likelyhood to catch on in developing underbanked Countries. These are two key things that will not just go away once people are aware of it.
If the SEC approved, the price goes up faster, if the SEC disapproves there is some pullback, consolidation and then the upwards trend continues.
We don't know if the price will go crazy high from now, or if it will calm down, you can't know. You just have to assess - are you prepared to handle holding through any issues?
If you aren't, just walk away.

Have a look at how BTU is trading on bitfinex to see the market values it. It crashed instantly from 500USD, to around 200USD. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 21:45:05
My understanding is when you press the 'sell' your order is filled when someone else on their system presses 'buy' for the equivalent, or a smaller amount at the price you chose to sell at or less. The delay is called spread.
So, imagine the price is 1000usd when the news comes out and just before the news comes out no one is buying and no one is selling. There is no liquidity in anticipation of the news. I can scroll back on bitfinex and see that for some hours the price did not move at all, no one bought or sold bitcoins on bitfinex during those times.
Then, the news comes out and its negative. You and everyone puts their sell orders at 1000usd per bitcoin, your order will not execute until someone else on your exchange buys one btc at the current buy price. In forex if you put a sell order for a few million on a low volume currency cross there will be a delay between when you buy or sell and when the order is actually filled and shown in your terminal, this can be any amount of time, it depends on whether or not others are doing the opposite of you at the time. As i said i imagine no one was buying bitcoin on a trading exchange the minute the news came out and if there was, the hoards of other peoples sell orders could well have been filled first.
Edit; i understand your point, the price would drop until all the buy limits would be executed and price would stabilize when the pressures balanced. HOWEVER, are all the exchanges sharing their liquidity? I'd guess not, so you'd need to wait for a buyer on your own exchange, right?
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:10:02
This needs to be at the top of the sub. The principle of bitcoin is to behave how the users want, if there is a forced move against the users then the price will drop. Users will unite and make the required change occur.
This may set a precedent forever more to keep in line with the user request.

To answer your question, you are not catered for in anyway in Bitcoin right now. You used to be and will be, but not now.
There is a plan in process and no way to speed up that process. Without creating contention. Segwit and lightning should have been ready and implemented BEFORE this became an issue. I don't know why it wasn't, does anyone know?

@_date: 2017-03-25 08:41:03
Sorry, but you are what we refer to as a "weak hand". 
The whole point of Bitcoin is that it has a high likely-hood to achieve a high potential. In a months time the price might be low, but in 3 months time the price could be back at the all time high. When the block size issue is resolved the price could be triple the all time high 3 months after that.
The only way early adopters make a fortune is because they ride through these issues, one comes with the other. The fortune comes with the stress.
Just look through the chart history and see what people went through that bought in at 300USD on the first run up have been through. This information was available to you before you bought in, why would you assume it would be a different success story now compared to in the past?

The idea of lobbying support for your protocol purely because you think the other option is bad and not on the merits of your own protocol is extremely immature and idiotic.
We shouldn't be choosing a protocol that is the best of a bad bunch, we should be choosing what is best for Bitcoin full stop.
If Core supporters think it is the choice to go for because it is the best option for Bitcoin, and BU supporters want BU because they think Core is rubbish then that highlights a key difference in the mental maturity of the two sides. One wants something because its best, the other just doesn't want the first to have it. It is playground tactics.

I'm sorry but this is a discussion over whether or not bitcoin can be considered an investment.
The other poster said that you can only speculate with bitcoin, he is wrong. The definition proves, like gold, bitcoin can be considered an investment. 
Based on your first sentence, referencing gold as an investment, you clearly agree with the correct stance. The standard of the investment is not what we are discussing, hence the facepalm.

Bull run this weekend
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:27:01
In a scenario where a large number of people need to settle their Lightning contracts on the blockchain, the price for doing so could increase substantially as the available space in bitcoin blocks becomes sparse. “At some point some people start losing out because the cost is just higher than what they can afford,” Todd said. “If you have a very large percentage of the network using Lightning, potentially this cost is very high. Potentially, we could get this mass outbreak of failure.”
For one, an adaptive block size limit could allow miners to increase capacity in these sorts of failure scenarios. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 07:37:05
Man, this is not technical at all. BU is bitcoin as it is right now, with one new feature for scaling, a market based consensus for the blocksize.
Cores vision....segwit changes the way data is handled within blocks and has a scaling solution LN which involves the use of third party 'hubs' that issues, in essence, credit and then settles once a day.

But, what is considered a high risk investment to one person may not be to another depending on their level of understanding. 
Regardless, we are only talking because someone said Bitcoin is a gamble and not an investment. I corrected him, all investments can carry risk, doesn't mean it isn't an investment.
Also, houses always have the same use but prices change based on demand and supply. Bitcoin can gain uses and has a finite supply, so in two fundamental ways bitcoin has more potential to increase in value.
If the price goes to 10k usd everyone will call it an investment. If it falls to nothing, a gamble. Hindsight is 2020. But I already made money in Bitcoin, go figure it's an investment to me.

I think you are talking about a long way down the road, they have to be IN Bitcoin to manipulate it. 
When they are IN Bitcoin their manipulations will probably still be less fluctuation in price than we see now because firstly it needs to be a STABLE and PROFITABLE looking investment for the average retail trader to trade in the first place. Secondly the market cap will be a lot higher if there is a few billion invested in Bitcoin over the course of the next few years.
Therefore the argument is kind of invalid in my personal opinion.

Yes, and if the blocks get full when LN is implemented and your LN transactions don't make it on the chain in time for settlement....you lose your coins. Oops.
That is why adaptive blocksize is needed to run LN network properly, adaptive blocksize like BU want, but core won't tell you this publicly right now because it undermines the argument against BU.

Does the author of this article even trade? His fractals are completely wrong. After we break the previous high the price will only come back down to that same high we broke out of according to previous price patterns, excluding bad news... which you cannot predict. The pattern that has repeated multiple times in exactly the same way so far.
Its funny that in his own article he points out even his previous 'analysis' was incorrect, why continue to post predictions?
It is premature right now, but I will throw it out there... if we break the all time high with momentum before the etf is approved I doubt we will ever see price below 1000usd again. Even without the etf price could hit 2000-5000usd if we got a big bull run after breaking the ath.
I think the author must be trying to prevent a dump if the etf isn't approved by dampening the bull/pump sentiment.

Holding something long term in anticipation of increased value is the DEFINITION of investing.
You can speculate with bitcoin (known as trading), you can invest in bitcoin and you can hedge with bitcoin. Each implies something different. 
Again, where on earth do you people come from and you talk a load of rubbish pretending you are some kind of authority on a subject of which you have NO CLUE on.
For the record, the outcome of a race doesn't potentially increase in value or decrease in value over time. So you can guess, gamble or speculate on the outcome but by the definition of INVESTING you cannot invest in the outcome. Jesus christ, dumb has new lows.

You're the idiot. I can barely be bothered to explain because you're probably too dumb to follow.
Lightning is THE only presently scheduled scaling step after Segwit, you don't have to use either, but obviously if you don't the main chain continues to slow to a halt. 
At the same time lightning works with once a day settlement on to the main chain, if the main chain ever becomes to congested to settle the lightning transactions by the end of the day those people whose transactions didn't get recorded lose their coins.
The only way to use lightning safely is to, where that situation is due to occur....quickly raise the blocksize limit with a market consensus instant change. This issue and resolution were presented by none other than your Peter Todd.
Told you, you're the idiot.

Maybe I had misunderstood your stance previously, if so I apologize. But I know I am correct with this, I'm in this field for my living. Bitcoin can be considered many things and used in many ways. As explained, you can speculate with bitcoin, invest in it directly, through an etf, you can hedge with it......saying something like 'you can only gamble with bitcoin because it is only speculative' does not make any sense and is just an obvious attack on bitcoin. This is a bitcoin forum, naturally I take exception. 
All investments are obviously considered speculative to a degree, you speculate an increase in value, that's the basis for any investment.

 I never made a prediction about the direction, not making a new low in a trend indicates weakness in the trend, its probably why there was a period of consolidation in the first place, actually. Waiting to see the direction of the break would confirm the market momentum. When you trade you don't predict the direction, only that a movement will occur and you jump in after the movement starts.
The fact that my triangle was THE point that the huge down move started is a credit to my TA ability, just before that break out price moved less than 5USD in 40 minutes - because it was consolidating in that triangle. I even posted a photo of that period in another post. If I wanted to I would have shorted just after my comment in this thread "looks like it is breaking down", I would have made an absolute fortune from that one trade If I had wanted to wouldn't I?
I didn't sell, because I don't short Bitcoin but your mocking of my ability is actually extremely ironic on the basis of the above. I might be "funny" but I trade for a living.

But for me it fell quite short in drumming up a buzz around Bitcoin's potential.
It did not even mention how high the value of Bitcoin would be if it captured a certain percentage of the remittance market, for example.
It seemed to be preoccupied with who the creator is, a fact that frankly no one would be bothered about in the least.

What if individual governments *need* to embrace it to try to contain it? China went to ban it, then USA was making all the progress with the start-ups, Russia went to ban it now they are funding the worlds largest mine. 
Why did these two countries do a full U-Turn after initially setting up to ban it? Their knee jerk reaction was just like yours, what could possibly have changed their minds?
If you ban it then it becomes used everywhere else you have zero leverage in it, your domestic company doesn't become a global brand. In short you lose out massively in so many ways and then your population uses it anyway with international infrastructure. Alas in this situation it is not so simple just to say "Well if people use it for certain things it will get banned".
What do you think the purpose of numbered accounts and offshore accounts was for the past 50 years? Just criminals and tax avoidance? Of course not, they used them yes, but all forms of financial planning used these offshore accounts. Anyone that could be sued in LEGAL business (Doctors/Lawyers/Politicians/Rich husbands or wifes) put their money into offshore accounts as it was the standard for asset protection. Note that in the last 5 years they've become all but obsolete because they are centralized. In comes decentralized Bitcoin. A totally new bull that isn't so easily tamed..

Bingo, we have a winner!
"You're selling low. You're selling low because that's what people who lose money do."
Everytime there's a correction the weak hands gets shaken out, but not all the new investors get shaken out and the old investors take the opportunity to buy...which is why the trend is upwards. We didn't even SEE the full correction, which would be down to 825USD, so Bitcoin is still majorlyyy bullish.
Not only that but this is the FIRST time, in three years, I've seen a correction caused specifically by a choice for the future of Bitcoin. I.e how to BEST move Bitcoin MAINSTREAM. This implies once a decision is MADE we will see an equally bullish move BEFORE any kind of mainstream adoption....add into that the next halving and wow - we literally just saw a load of people get bullied out of the most bullish investment of the century for no real reason.
But, it is normal for those who do not have the guts to make real money. Just like 200 to 1300. There will be a 1300 to 10,000.  
....as if people thought there would be no pushing and pulling to put bitcoin on a new protocol. What did you expect?

Some might say if you have enough, cashing out in one go isn't exactly an option, but anyway I hold because it is the only place you can have money where it is truly yours.
Domestic bank account? Can get stolen in an instant by the government for any reason they decide at any point. Happens all the time.
Offshore account? Frozen in an instant and pass information to western governments upon request generally. If a bank is connected to the global market they operate KYC and AML, its very hard to just open these accounts now and maintaining them is harder.
Gold? As if anyone can successfully hide or transport Kilos of gold in their house.
If you had a few million, or billion dollars and knew you were going to be sued/taken to court or had people after you to extort you or you need to hide it for any other reason - there is literally not a single other option other than Bitcoin.
To be honest I've never seen anyone talking about this here before and I've tried not to mention it. But I'm getting more impatient with the dumb reasons people come out with why people hold bitcoin.
Here it is in plain black and white for the first and last time. If you're holding bitcoin for anything other than the above, you are almost definitely insignificant in the world of bitcoin. Bitcoin is 100% invaluable because of the above outlined reason, know why bitcoin in popular in China? Hazard a guess. 
Bitcoin is the new "offshore bank account" and when the slow Westerners realize this it will literally explode over night. I call the West slow because the wealthy people in the West are still trying to use "Offshore  bank accounts", which is becoming obsolete.

This, Bitcoin is basically guaranteed at this point to become a globally used currency. With Japan now accepting it nationwide, Russia trying to compete with China for the world's largest mining operation. The implementation of Segwit and ultimately lightning/mimble wimble etc, there is no longer any gamble at all with Bitcoin.
A few years ago, before we had any adoption, just after the 2013 crash, we had no idea how we would scale, then no idea if we would get out of the scaling debate but literally all of these things are a non-issue now.
So yeh, this poster is spot on. Spending Bitcoin for the last couple of months has been a really stupid idea and will remain stupid for the next couple of years.

There's a trick for this, it's called: Leave the scamming oppressive police state also known as USA.
Sell your house, quit your job, move to Panama or anywhere else you can buy citizenship, denounce your US citizenship, buy a big house in Bitcoin, buy a sports car in bitcoin, cash out 200,000USD into a bank account and don't pay a single penny to any government and do whatever you want for the rest of your life.
Unfortunately, as someone living in the USA, you almost certainly won't have the balls to do this and would rather give all your money away just so you don't "get in trouble".

Fibonacci is like a self fulfilling prophecy, after a swing up (or down) there is always a retracement as people collect their profit. The degree to which the price retraces can be estimated based on previous levels of support and resistance, round numbers (800/850), and Fibonacci.
When you get a confluence of factors, on a round number, previous support, falls within the fibonacci range - then you can keep an eye on that area. If the price behaves in the way you expected when it reaches you can jump on to that move and profit to the next "level".
The thing to remember is when trading you only jump in after a confirmation of the move. When you are predicting the price you simply assume it will go in the way of the trend, for example in this situation with bitcoin we assume each break out is positive for the price because that is the general trend. However if the break out is negative we start outlining the next levels of support (based on the confluence of factors, noted above) that will "catch" the price and bounce the price off that level.
Edit: For example right now, we just broke 1100USD, if the pull back can't break to below that then the buying pressure is too strong and that failure to pull back through is essentially the confirmation of that - there will then be a "break out" even from there. It would be small though, because the level of resistance is small. The more significant the level the more significant the reaction.
Edit: we just gained 25USD in 5 minutes, real time example for you :-)

If bitcoin is at 500USD next year it is still winning, I don't pretend to be able to know the future. I invested at around 500USD - so please don't imply I made a wrong decision because even by your worst case scenario it went perfectly for me...

It appears what happened today was a group of people cashed in or shorted bitcoin from the bounce off the all time high. i.e long positions were cashed in just before the alh in anticipation of the resistance and because ultimately there was no breakout from the ath it became evident that the momentum was not strong enough to continue the trend and so more followed suit in cashing in / shorting.
The volume of funds in the above outlined situation caused the price to drop so significantly the 1hrly AND 4hrly trendline was broken - which is also signal to sell to those not preempting the resistance.
So to answer your question, TA is capable of moving the price drastically!

You're talking as though he has something to gain from making something like this up....I assume you think he does?
All I know, is I saw this guy a few days before the first crash say the day it was going to occur on.
Then I saw him predict another crash in 72hrs, then there was another crash.
Then I see his explanation makes sense, and another person confirming that he too has seen these loans.
Then I see another guy who claims everything is a lie and that he never predicted anything and the loans don't exist because the other guy who confirmed it is actually him.

Hey, thanks for the response, its up over 40USD since the breakout now - 1063.73USD as I type.
I only started following the charts from my previous (and first) prediction on reddit which was the breakout of 940USD to 1000USD 3 days before it happened but the strange thing is, the price action is following technical analysis to the pip. I don't know if it has always been this way but it really is very strange coming over from forex, I expected more noise.
Because of the recent hammer formation on the 1h (1 candles ago) the breakout potentially has more to give, my guess is a pull back to 1050 at some point and then to consolidate until hitting the 1hrly or 4hrly up trend before the next breakout.

I'm trying to show you that what you just said applies to every commodity. Take gold for example, its only worth is that people like it for jewelry and it has a history of being used as a store of value. It doesn't have any value outside what we are willing to pay for it. Do we need jewelry to have a running society? What real use does gold have?  It actually has less use than Bitcoin, doesn't it? Do you think gold is a scam? 
To answer you I'm not a shill, a shill for who? I'm pretty sure that question isn't sincere, more an attempt to discredit what I said. Actually I'm just someone who values something on the basis of its use. I'm someone who saw what it would be worth and made a lot of money from it - why wouldn't I be fond of it or believe in it? For what reason don't you like it?

Back pedaling? I made a thread three days ago predicting this swing and even from what range it would occur from, the price just hit 1000USD on a few exchanges. 
Do you really think it is possible to predict not only the move by the exact timing of the move? It was based on when the price action would reach the precipice of the formation. It is impossible to predict timing, no one can accurately do that.
I'm sorry but I think you just don't like that I got it right. I do this for a living, so don't beat yourself up.
Because of how condescending your response was I'll leave this information for you:-
When I made the buy from 945 lets just say "with one standard lot" I put the take profit at 995, feel free to look up on google what those words mean and see what it means in terms of money and you'll see if I need to learn for the future buddy.

No, *you* don't know how it works. You can fill 90% of the block with 5-10sat/b transactions and it still forces everyone else to compete to get in the remaining space artificially. This therefore pushes the fees up for everyone else, instead of 50c you could pay any amount, even 100usd, to get in the remaining space IF the fee market managed by the wallets had the demand.
Therefore if a miner does this successfully then most of their spam TXs will get dropped from the mempool so they get a refund, of the ones that confirm they get a percentage back if they mine the block but overall they make a shed load more money from the higher fees everyone else is paying.

I think these are valid points, included in that is lightning and all the functionality / wallet changes this will bring. Then things like mimble wimble and I'm certain there are other things in the pipeline.
It is frequent development of this kind that kept Bitcoin interesting to those with short attention spans who ultimately got bored with Bitcoin's lack of progress and moved to altcoins. These same people will be moving back on that basis also.

We are just a different personality in that case, because I believe in "live and let live". Not "unite everyone by force".
The only reason we would all need to be "coming together" in a World government (or in an EU type system) is because of entities like the US Government and the EU trying to exert dominance over the World to "compete" with Russia and China - both of whom keep to themselves in comparison to USA/Europe.
Maybe Europe is more stable because of the EU, but maybe it would be equally stable with a simple free trade agreement and none of the "catches".
I do not think we need to enslave the human race in order to achieve security and I think our security is compromised by the very people who pretend to look out for us. We need only look at "terrorism" and the fact they are armed by our own governments to understand that.

XAPO is the best Debit Card service online today as far as I'm concerned.
The fact that they got you all sorted in a couple of hrs is testimony, some companies will let you order a card, let you "verify" by submitting documents.....THEN tell you that you aren't actually fully verified and demand new requirements to use their service fully, requirements not mentioned anywhere on their website.

It is extremely pertinent that people understand that if the price doesn't react positively to positive developments, but instead goes down in spite of them, that there is something very wrong.
Why did the market in BCH move up completely randomly, but doesn't react at all to developmental progress?

I know of people who wouldn't be able to send money out of their Country if it wasn't for Bitcoin and they aren't in China.
I also know people who run multi-million dollar businesses using Bitcoins, and they aren't exchanges, traders or miners.
I know people who have become millionaires because of Bitcoin, none of the above business types again.
Please define what you mean by scam, because from where I am sitting it is extremely valuable to many people and doing great things for many. 
I think the main people who dislike bitcoin fall into two catagories:-
1.) Not bright enough to make money from it
2.) Have something to lose by it gaining popularity
These conditions apply to those who actively dislike the bitcoin concept. So which are you? Those outside of these two categories are merely indifferent to or passively fond of bitcoin. Why else would someone have something against a peer to peer online decentralized store of value? It doesn't exactly sound like a bad thing does it?

Semantics? Or do you *really* not grasp what inflation implies in this context? 
The rate of supply affects the purchasing power, an increased rate of supply negatively affects the value/purchasing power. Decreasing purchasing power is an effect of inflation.
I can write about the rate of supply changing and go into the economics of supply and demand each time this process is referenced, or I can say "inflation" and have all but the most simple understand exactly what is being referenced.


We agree on that...

There literally isn't a serious rebuttal, which is exactly why Ver and the BCH developer are already talking about removing the EDA. However, in rbtc anyone that criticizes the EDA is a concern troll and it is hailed as the best part of bch.
The EDA can only be removed via a HardFork, take a guess at if this will be contentious or not? Then another guess at what happens to the price if BCH splits again...
It's imperative the innocent holders are aware of where this is headed, its very early days as this is only just being realized in the last few days. Obviously, there will be panic as the contention over this issue is realized.

Going to Hong Kong/Macau and sending it by Bank Wire. This is what the OP is referring to. That is what they actually do. You can even get other people to help you do it and pay a fee if you aren't sure how to proceed and it is reliable and cheap and under little scrutiny through corporate accounts.
When you think about the regulations it is little bit of a joke to imagine some random Chinese billionaire dumps millions into Bitcoin so he can fly to USA/Europe buy a house complete verification on Coinbase, dump millions instantly into the account and then immediately tries to cash it out into a USA/European bank account. It's quite funny that people think that is reality, as if there is no AML in the EU or USA. 
Please don't say "offshore account" it really isn't that simple.
This scenario is literally the most obvious case of money laundering a USA/EU OR offshore bank could ever see and the guys account would be frozen. This isn't a guess, AML policy is literally designed to catch this kind of behavior and it doesn't make mistakes. 
His honest answer of "oh I made the money legitimately I'm just illegally circumventing Chinese law" would get the money confiscated in a heart beat in court.
In summary, as I said, it is quite funny that so many people actually believe this is happening when the other option is so much more simple and cheaper.

When the price breaks 983USD if it breaks with strong momentum we will breaking 1000USD within a few hours. When the price breaks 1000USD it (the price) will go absolutely crazy and probably gain 100-300USD over the course of that day.
I literally can't stop checking the charts right now lol. First we have to break 979USD.
@_date: 2017-01-05 08:36:42
When we get into specifics all the "answers" kind of go out the door, technical analysis and the principles therein are still affected by outside factors (all the exchanges get hacked in one week, for example) which is called Fundamental analysis.
There are so many different factors that affect the price that we cannot say, there is a break out at point X and it will continue until point Y. In reality we have no idea how strong the breakout will be and how long it will continue, we are only working on our best guesses.
How this relates to your question is that the uptrend will continue as long as the TA (Technical analysis) matches up for everyone and as long as the fundamentals are in place.
Translation, until some bad news comes out and the 4hrly trendline is broken we will not have a "crash".
Imagine if tomorrow we hear bitstamp has been hacked, everyone will long positions will think "screw the technical analysis, the price is going to go down because everyone is scared, I'll close my order and cut the loss". The fact some traders did that make the signal to sell stronger, so more see it and repeat the action....the result is the price begins to go down sharply.
However, even though the 4hrly trendline broke and the price dropped 200USD the price is now approaching the daily trendline. Well, it hasn't broken that for 6 months everyone is thinking, so why will it break it now? This is just a standard breakout of the 4hrly trendline, the daily trendline is stronger and will hold it. Not only will it hold it but it will BOUNCE the price.
The result, everyone is now watching to see the bounce confirmed, say it is - we are back on a new up trend.
I know you will ask, but what if it breaks the daily trend line? Well then you go to the weekly trendline. If it breaks that? Any significant area of support. The fact of the matter is at some point Bitcoin will be seen as a bargain and people will start buying again.
The other interesting point with Bitcoin is, there is a huge underground economy working through Bitcoin. Rest assured people will be buying bitcoin in volume at any price.

Governments don't dictate morals, they dictate laws, people and their morals are free to override a democratic government's unjust decisions.
Only, as I put it, a simple minded sheep takes no stance on the above and accepts all laws above morality.
You are admittedly the kind of low-life that would have complained to the police if a black person sat on the white bus "because the laws told you to".

Resistance in charting is a term relating to the technical analysis of the chart.
For example if every time the price has hit 1000USD it could not break through it, and this continued for 10 years, with the price hitting 1000USD every month and never going higher - you would expect this trend to continue right?
Well when looking at the chart you will regularly see areas that get tested and can not be broken a few times in a row, this area gets marked as resistance.
Everyone then marks it as resistance and so each time the price reaches that area we all know to sell at the point because it probably won't get through it.
But imagine if it does break through, there must be a lot of "momentum" for it to get through right? Therefore you can assume that there is a LOT of buying pressure to get through that resistance so provided there isn't any more points of resistance coming up the price will continue to go in that direction.... that is until it reaches a resistance area where we all sell again and that area of resistance is now proven as a different level to break. The cycle repeats and it is the same for "support" levels.
If there is a scenario where there is NO resistance then the situation is VERY interesting. The only thing triggering people to sell is their best guess as to where the top is, the battle is between conserving your profit and your greed to make more. Naturally people will be selling at different points depending on their balls, but naturally people will be buying in thinking it has yet to reach the top - i.e there is little consensus other than "hell yeh we are bullish and we're making money".
Hope this clears it up!
EDIT: It is spotting these levels that people are able to successfully trade, if you look through my post history you can see where I accurately predicted the breakout of 940USD to swing up to 1000USD three days before it occured. Also the most recent breakout causing the 50USD increase about 10hrs before it occured. In the same way the breakout from the ATH will likely spark a big reaction of some sort....
It is all using the same principles of support, resistance and breakouts.

This. 
It's not as if you can't already send stocks across the world to anyone with a computer almost free or that stocks aren't already being used as a payment method by huge companies around the Globe.
Lets face it, the people of China, India and South America and every other Country suffering financial woes have always been using stocks to form the basis of payments for their new companies or hedge their currency. That SA company that now only accepts Bitcoin for payment is simply not a new thing - it was done many time before with stocks!
Don't forget stocks are decentralized and a single stock has never been completely ran into the ground by a dishonest or mismanaged company causing billions to be lost in the course of months. 
Obviously Bitcoin has never been tested in such a way to be able to prove it can remain ultimately bullish in the face of adversity in the way all stocks manage to consistently do.
Basically, Pretagonist has hit the nail on the head, he has single handedly out smarted everyone that is behind 15 Billion of investment from every corner of the earth and social status and growing with a simple statement....this was all done before with stocks!

Increase spending on the up, slow down on the down, profit each year. Its not that crazy.
I think it is very likely the price will test 1000USD again some day, maybe even this year. Maybe we will be at 500 to 800 for the next 2 years but I think it is inevitable we will test 1000USD again.

Anything not normal for the account is reported by the account manager to the in-house AML person and if a SAR gets filled out the account is frozen for 15 days while they decide if they will pass it on to the police for further investigation. They do not request anything from you and they don't tell you anything during this period. Both of you misinformed OP. It's not fine if you get a SAR and there are loads of restrictions for receiving money into personal accounts, the restriction is in the form of what happens AFTER the funds are received. 
If they pass it on to the police all your bank accounts get locked and any large asset you've purchased since the "suspicious activity" began will be seized until the case concludes. People in this thread really have no clue what they're talking about.
To the OP find out if your bank is Bitcoin friendly and give them the info before you do it, don't lie, that's concealing the origin of funds and can easily be spun as something bad in itself if it was uncovered in the future. Like for instance if you get a SAR later on for any other reason and they actually investigate what you said when 10k turned up randomly in your account.
If there is anything about the funds you are trying to conceal jesus christ don't put it into a bank account!

It's called a "break out", basically there is no more resistance keeping the price down. In theory it should go crazy when it breaks out. Naturally there is a retracement "crash" later on but the extent of which is never known.
@_date: 2017-01-24 06:06:44
So they can only know where bitcoin has "been" based on public wallet addresses that have since been associated with certain activities?
Is that the extent to which it is trackable? I have never understood the point of mixers.
Say, someone buys 1000USD of bitcoin from coinbase, sends it to Bob to buy drugs, then Bob cashes out on another exchange.......absolutely no need for a mixer, right? The second exchange doesn't know where the funds came from and the first doesn't know where they went to?

I don't think you actually read anything I write with any depth of real understanding. It's actually quite comical how you can extrapolate something so far away from what was actually said.

Actually, the other person who disagrees with you was the person who brought up black people using it as an example of how the Governments can get things SO wrong. 
Contrary to how you seem to have perceived this discussion, that concept is not specific to race and I do not keep "trying to inject race". As is clear from this thread I did not even bring it up, it was a tool brought up by another to help you understand their stance on this issue but you consistently misunderstand. 
You weren't able to link together the fact that unreasonable/immoral/unjust/unfair - whatever you want to call it - legislation should be fought and not just followed blindly and the disgraceful behavior of the government towards black people was an example of a past situation where that occurred. You asked what that had to do with anything!
We are saying, hey, just like slavery this is not acceptable - and the other option is not prison, its innovation.
My use of low-life was highlighting how just going along with laws does not make you a good person historically, because yes, I and many others would consider that person in that particular scenario a low-life. Just like those going out of their way to report Jews in Germany - that was government policy too, agree with following that just because you're told to? I'd guess not, otherwise, this conversation was a complete waste of my time.

Can someone outline exactly how a small increase in the strength of RMB to USD would make people want to exchange BTC back into RMB?
I thought everyone was saying them buying bitcoin was to escape capital controls? Which is it, to hedge RMB or escape capital controls?
If it was to hedge their weakening currency and they were that in tune with finance why wouldn't they just go long on USD on a forex exchange?
I really feel like I'm missing something here with this train of thought.
I personally think this is a group of people trying to force a flash crash, short the sell, then buy back in ready for breaking the all time high.
That or banking institutions all selling their coins trying to dismantle the momentum behind bitcoin in general (less likely).
Or everyone trading bitcoin knows there would be a bounce off the all time high, which was even mentioned in some youtube video a few days ago as almost certainly going to occur.
But I really can't see the exchange rate over the course of a single day having ANY effect what so ever.

You do that by deciding what the "source" of the funds are, for example from selling gold shares might be a different type of taxable level in comparison to selling shares from broker. You want to give the government the best cut and also the bigger the payment the bank see to the tax office the better.
You just don't want to get the laundering report completed, because your funds will get frozen AFTER they arrive in the account.
You cannot just say you got it from Bitcoin anything, because by it's nature it is un-provable in almost all cases and so is ASSUMED to be from criminal origin from the perspective of the banking sector right now.

&amp;nbsp; 
Not once did I say I didn't recognize the government - do you see how once again you've extrapolated imaginary things from people's words? I only just said in the previous response that you seem to have a real problem with doing that, so your answer is to write another response where you do it over and over again? Do you not actually learn?
&amp;nbsp; 


&amp;nbsp; 
No, you understand an imaginary position as pointed out above - not my position. I've explained very clearly what I think but you hear something completely different each and every-time.
&amp;nbsp; 
Look; you think I fired the government or don't recognize a government when in reality what I said was that people need to take a stand on legislation they disagree with. How is that so difficult for you to follow?
&amp;nbsp; 
You think you've understood something, but you consistently miss the point and simply writing more nonsense and quoting imaginary characters from children's TV does not change anything.
&amp;nbsp; 
I think the real issue here is you are trying to win an argument that does not exist. All you actually need to do is understand a very simple concept.
&amp;nbsp; 
I will write it in numbered sentences, try and focus and remember this isn't just about winning an argument:-
&amp;nbsp; 
1.) Governments make mistakes and treat people unfairly.
2.) People are within their right to take a stand against what they consider to be unfair policies.
3.) They can do this through innovation in this particular situation.
&amp;nbsp; 
There, three simple sentences so you can understand that you don't actually disagree with anything I'm saying and that nothing I'm saying is particularly revolutionary or anarchistic.
&amp;nbsp; 
What you got caught up on was the examples of unfairness from the governments, jews/blacks etc but don't worry yourself about that - just read the three simple sentences.
&amp;nbsp; 
Edit: I've even added paragraphs for you. Good luck.

I'm going to confuse the noobs even more now. But this is wrong, its not a "blocksize increase" in the traditional sense. It redefines the rules of what "blocksize" means in terms of the structure of the TX and a side effect of that is an increased capacity.
To "increase the blocksize" once Segwit is implemented means to increase the weight limit which can only be done with a HF, which is the same requirement right now to "increase the blocksize". Maybe that's why people talk about the details, because when people try to summarize they get it wrong?

As I said there's no much point discussing this with someone who is a Europhile, BUT if you're interested there is a strong anti-EU sentiment developing in France, Italy and Austria. 
I can guarantee it is also found other members but is less reported, but the next Country to leave will probably spark the next and the next. The British have been successful through history, unlike other nations, they are well aware that they are jumping off a sinking ship.
The creation of the EU was the birth-child of globalization, one step closer to a one World government. It is anti-democracy and anti sovereignty, it took a while to reveal itself in this light but now it is plain for everyone with eyes to see. Non-elected leaders removing the power of self determination from member states - what kind of situation is that? It is nothing like democracy we purport to support.
France will need to change their constitution just to get out of it, which makes it almost impossible from them to leave....it says it all really.
To be blunt, though, it sounds more like you just don't like corporations and see being part of the EU as a defense. If it wasn't for that threat would you really want give up your government's law making ability to people in another Country that were not even elected by your people?

Still don't think you should get out before the fork?

It is in effect being positioned as an eastern niche and somewhat outside of the scope of the western markets at present.

Lol, you are hilarious.
What does my public prediction three days ago, that I made a significant amount of money on over those three days - because it was exactly correct, have to do with my ability to follow price action and make accurate predictions?
I've edited this a few times, because your condescension is frustrating to me but understand this:-
People like you pay people like me to manage their money, if you saw that thread and traded one lot on what I said, you'd have made 5 million dollars in three days. Let that sink in for a minute.
There's not a trick in this, if you had the money, and saw my thread you would now be a multi millionaire - in three days. I made the call many hours before the move, you had the time to get in too, but you missed the ball....What can I say?
As I said, I do this for a living, don't beat yourself up kiddo.

He is quite clearly illustrating the fact that the choices of the government do not always represent a moral or just perspective.
Therefore yours or anyone's following everything that the Government says just to fit in with the law makes you a bit of a simple minded sheep and lacking in the ability to discern what is fair and just based on real life morals.

You can't have 2mb blocks once Segwit is implemented. You can only increase the weight limit using hardforks, this is how throughput is increased from now on.
To answer the question the issue is around the fact that this HF is completely rushed and was arranged in private by big companies and on those two points is contentious. Many are satisfied with the fact we have enough on our plate now just rolling out Segwit wallets and setting up lightning and the next upgrades.
I was personally for the 2x portion of this agreement, however given how contentious it remains I can see that it is a REALLY bad idea to move forward with it.
Once segwit wallets arrive set up a flag day for 2x and include lots of other upgrades with it. It is basic logic.

The design of Bitcoin, per the white paper, is that fees would eventually pay for the miners.

Any prediction is a partial lucky guess, but general Technical Analysis allows you to find the moments where a large move will happen....taking into the general "feeling" in the market allows you to make an assumption of which way the price will go.
In this situation there was a convergent point of two significant trendlines (basically a triangle, when price hits the point of the triangle it is forced to "break") which almost all traders would have noted, with a positive market sentiment they were all just waiting to see the price break up before they jump on board.
The next significant level is at 940-950USD, there will probably be a bounce down off of that, but if we break that level with good momentum we will possibly be at 1000USD within the day. It just depends on HOW 950USD is broken and how big the bounce off it is.

But they artificially push the rest of the fees up potentially by hundreds of percent, fees which goes to them and then they also get a percentage of the money back that they initially spent....so there is a clear profit incentive on this activity.

The fees are driven by what the market is willing to pay, all you need to do as a spammer/miner is fill the blocks with the tiny fee transactions and let the fee estimation on wallets do the work for people to compete to be included in the free space of the next block by paying higher fees. 
As a large miner if you pick up 25% of the blocks you get a quarter of what you spent back right away, these fees are tiny anyway and many would get dropped from the pool after not confirming....then all the profit from the artificially high fees (which could be 10x more than they should be) not only makes them huge amounts of money but also drives the argument to make the blocks larger - which then centralizes the mining and makes the whole thing even more profitable.
This won't stop until the developers work out a way to stop it being profitable.

Don't get upset, no need to start bolding words and swearing.
As you seem to have adopted a "know all" internet persona, I thought I'd point out that contrary to one of your key assertions the stock market is not decentralized.
You said: "Stocks are decentralized." 
"...Stock Exchange is considered a centralized market because orders are routed to the exchange and are then matched with an offsetting order. On the other hand, the foreign exchange market is not deemed to be centralized because there is no one location where currencies are traded and it is possible for traders to find competing rates from various dealers from around the world.

I'm sure you have "forgotten more than I know" but lets be serious, you need to start researching if you want to offer anything of value and retort arguments about a subject you clearly lack knowledge on. I've started you off with the above purely to provide some hard evidence that your confidence is sorely misplaced. I could write a real response to point out all the mistakes but it would take too much time.
Edit: I forsee you will respond about the fact you said "paper" stocks as though that changes the nature of the entire market, please don't waste my time. They are trying to phase paper stocks out anyway:

Not caring about negative things doesn't stop them being negative nor make something less debilitating. It's akin to saying "I still function fine without my legs because I don't care they're gone".
The issue around hardforks isn't just that some people don't like them, they don't like them for an actual reason - which is that it can result in two new coins with both claiming the original name and diluting the market cap, creating confusion, creating animosity, one trying to destroy the other for profits sake.
As it stands, as aforementioned, the whole of rbtc are touting the EDA is THE very reason why BCH has a chance.  They aren't going to give it up even if the developers say what's best for them.....we've seen what happens when developer's say what's best with that group of people.

I spoke about it a bit with my wife and I think I have determined what would happen.
If the global financial system began to collapse people that could would move their money into the next strongest currency and that action would prop up that currency.
Which ever currency ended up being the slowest to depreciate would be the one people would move their money into, that government/system would then be propped up so there could be no complete collapse.
Maybe others can say if they agree with this sentiment? The idea that ultimately at least one system/currency would survive and therefore the online financial system would remain intact even if the worst did happen. 
The one currency and government would then be a global power and ensure to keep hold of that strength while others refine their systems using that new currency as a base.

Richard needs to understand Bitcoin IS being used for commerce by many people and SHOULD be used for commerce by many more.
I think Roger appeared more coherent in this debate in a couple of areas, he comes across very well, they both do. However, I do fully agree with Richards stance on BCH and on rBTC and also on his stance regarding Roger's pumping of altcoins. 
I feel like Roger basically thought "if these guys are going to kill Bitcoin I might as well make money on that too". However, even with this mindset it's clear he would still rather Bitcoin succeeded.
I think them showing so much respect to each other was really refreshing to see, although at one point when Richard said "just thought I'd let youall know Roger is a miner" was very borderline.  Roger handled that very well.

I think these are valid points, included in that is lightning and all the functionality / wallet changes this will bring. Then things like mimble wimble and I'm certain there are other things in the pipeline.
It is frequent development of *this* kind that kept Bitcoin interesting to those with short attention spans who ultimately got bored with Bitcoin's lack of progress and moved to altcoins. These same people will be moving back on that basis also.
Once Russia's gigantic mine and ASIC company is up and running competing with Jihan etc this will also be a huge benefit.

There isn't a time limit to this unfortunately, at any point an up-tight accounts manager could look into your account and agree with you that they are suspicious, then you will get the SAR and the account will be frozen. It is actually illegal for a banker to see something that may be construed as suspicious and *not* report it, imprisonment for this is up to 4 years. There will be no opportunity for you to contest this, they let a specialist decide how suspicious it is and whether it gets passed on to the Police.
Generally after a SAR, even if it doesn't get passed to the police, you get a letter to tell you that you can no longer bank with them because you've been deemed high risk.
Honestly it might be worth emailing scans of those documents to an accounts manager and saying to put it in your file. Or ring them and say to put a note on the transaction to legitimize it.

It can't be confiscated by the Government. Imagine all the Doctors/Lawyers/Government officials hiding wealth/Business people/Criminals/People avoiding alimony or court orders with billions upon billions that will put all their "spare" money in Bitcoin purely because of this.
This use case is here right now and used right now, then incorporate all the other uses. International remittance/transferring wealth through borders without approval from anyone. NOTHING else in this entire World can do this!
Literally anyone with any real sum of money is desperately looking for "Bitcoin" as the solution to literally ALL their most serious concerns about their wealth, i.e keeping it! This is *entirely* outside of the speculation and the possibility of having these benefits AND make money at the same time. In short, Bitcoin is absolutely a once in a lifetime buy at this early stage.

If you type "Bitcoin" right now, you see an article from Forbes, huge user base and people take them seriously. Check what they're saying "Do NOT buy Bitcoin" and then providing no valid reasons at all, clearly they didn't even research what they were saying because its technically invalid.
This is FUD, fear uncertainty disorder, it is essentially spreading misinformation to upset the traders/holders into panicking. Mainstream media have been saying Bitcoin is nothing, don't buy it, its dying, its dead almost on a monthly basis since it started. Yet its the best performing asset of 2015 2016 and will be of 2017 too.
In fact, in the last couple of months we have seen the first mainstream news speaking positively about Bitcoin.

You acknowledge that I was exactly correct with respect to the process of reporting, but think the rest is bollocks even though you have never even seen what happens when a SAR is actually filed. 
It's not bollocks what I wrote is exactly what happens if the SAR gets sent off to the FCA. It sounds like your manager was just winding you up because he would go to prison in a heart beat if he was really intentionally behaving improperly with SARs and he will know this.
    It was an absolute joke and potentially wasn't what was supposed to happen.
Well, if he wasn't just being silly and one of those SARs come to light in a future police investigation whoever didn't behave in accordance with their training will be in court and potentially facing a prison sentence depending on the scale of the crime that they facilitated. By law the Nominated Officer literally facilitated the customer's money laundering if they didn't behave according to their training.

Well, there's that little issue of his reputation being irreparably destroyed by being a massive hypocrite. 


This is a reasonable point? It's just more rubbish! Used as a currency by *who*? I use it as a currency, my friends use it as a currency millions of people around the world use it as a currency. The whole of Japan uses it as a currency, 200,000+ shops accept it there and its literally a currency by Law. So how is that his most "valid" point when it is intentionally misleading and incorrect? Is it only a "currency" is the USA thinks it is? World doesn't work like this.
I still have no idea how people take him seriously on this subject, it's literally exactly like me owning a horse and cart company in the 1950's and telling everyone cars are rubbish. It's ridiculous. 
Cars have no intrinsic value because they aren't living like horses, haven't been used for hundreds of years as a mode of transport, plus they are expensive and slower than horse and cart because by law someone has to walk in front of them for safety purposes.
"in England, where in small towns the law required the automobilist to notify a village constable, who would walk in front of the car waving two red warning flags while the driver followed slowly behind."
It's so obvious Cars will never catch on.

Holy sh*t..... they literally tested out how to spam the blocks completely full. If all the economic activity moved to an 8mb chain, you could then start slowly spamming the blocks full again in the same way that was done for 1mb and do this entire "debate" again to double to 16mb.
This process could be rinsed and repeated until only a couple of mining pools dominate the entire space due to the latency of finding blocks and at that point a government could just turn them both off ruining the network completely.
Finally I completely "get" what small blockers mean.

Nice analysis, you think there actually will be another "issue" as we approach 1000USD again?
I can't tell if I agree or not, I think this community is a bit jumpy, they get scared very easily. BUT that could just have been the margin trading from Chinese exchanges, a big sell off now might barely dent the bullish sentiment....
My gut instinct is the next time we break 1000USD, we are literally going to take off.

I don't think you are too bright, although you talk as though you know exactly what you are talking about.
Bitcoin is being used in the same way gold is now, except it also has uses in aspects of money transfer that completely trumps all other means right now.......and it is decentralized. It is 100% unique and has been for years now.
It also combines the two functions and allows you to actually save, speculate and then spend your gold. All without third parties if you want it that way, which is shocking in today's society.
Additionally we are now just about a 1000USD Bitcoin and when Bitcoin does break 1000USD it will be all over the news and suddenly a huge number of people will suddenly realize the above points and understand its true use and value.
You saying that its far fetched for 25% of a country to adopt Bitcoin is a totally moot point and actually highlights your lack of understanding here because Bitcoin doesn't need 25% of one country.
It doesn't actually need ANYTHING more than it has, but if it had 5% of gold investors, 5% of Forex investors and a small section of the remittance market and each bitcoin would be worth a small fortune. This will be a reality at some point in the future.
That is BEFORE there is ANY kind of real adoption using bitcoin as a means of payment - even though that is already happening. i.e there are many mainstream companies already accepting bitcoin directly.
In short you are just naysayer and you will be proved wrong just as soon as bitcoin breaks 1000USD with any significance.
I think some people that own essentially no bitcoins, i.e less than 10, are expecting each bitcoin to be worth 100,000USD and anything less than that is failure. Completely idiotic. 
The fact is you have nothing at stake so why actually look into it seriously, it is far easier just to doubt everything. Like the postal services probably did with Email "derp most people don't even own computers, know how to use computers....and they think email will be a success?" - that is you right now, buddy. Bitcoin already is a success.
EDIT: To elaborate, I've been studying the btc/usd chart and as a forex trader it is clearly being traded in the same way forex is already. Except for one key thing that is different, there have been no serious down trends in over a year. That is frankly insane and unheard of in commodities or currency.
So what is driving this uptrend? New uses and adoption. More and more people are slowly getting interesting in Bitcoin and it is being used by more and more companies. More people are finding their own use for it. There are many reasons but the facts speak for themselves. 
As of right now, we are in an hourly uptrend, a 4h uptrend, a daily a weekly and a monthly uptrend. Again, this is absolutely unheard of.
Bitcoin IS a success already, even if it drops 100USD tomorrow, because the yearly trend shows even if it does drop that it will recover and continue as normal........no worries. Happy new year.

It's "healthy" because "market". If price goes from 0 to 10,000usd when people collect profit where does price go? To 0. If it goes from 0 to 2000, to 1000 THEN to 10,000....when they collect profit it goes back to 2000. The previous "high" is only formed if price goes low or sideways after it.
These corrections provide the support to build the foundation of the next breakout. They are absolutely CRITICAL to Bitcoin's growth.
To put this in practical terms, price should ideally move sideways around 4000usd for the next couple of weeks and THEN go higher. 4000-5000USD then becomes like a "floor".
Then we should put in a "floor" at 6000USD, then 10000USD etc etc etc...

If you are a hedge fund manager as this reply suggests then I think you've made a mistake in not suggesting Bitcoin to your customers because there has been heavy adoption by hedge fund owners/managers in recent months.
Simply looking at the chart it is quite clearly the strongest performing currency OR commodity of the last 2 years, so something comes access as strange there.
Not only that but this is a tradable item that has an actively developing infrastructure which boosts its value continually and is just at the point of having mass adoption as a real possibility.
As someone who is a professional trader I can tell you, Bitcoin definitely looks like it is going to be huge quite soon.

Listen to this guy, he evidently knows more about your financial situation than you do. 
The other guy, referencing the biggest gold shill in the World as a source for why the leading competing asset is in a bubble, okay.
There aren't any real reasons why someone shouldn't invest in Bitcoin. That's why the price has been rising like crazy for months and months in spite of the endless FUD from mainstream media. That's why when you read articles against Bitcoin they are like a bad joke, there is nothing to say that can be taken seriously by these people.

This is like the principle behind privacy laws, or lack thereof in countries like UK and USA. 
People say, "Well I have nothing to hide so I don't care if the government watch me in the living room, because it will stop criminals".
It is just spineless people giving up more and more of their rights and accepting ridiculous policies so often that these policies become the norm.
If he pays he taxes he shouldn't mind giving all his financial information to some random company, right?
The whole point behind bitcoin is it allows you to take some of your privacy back, working with these money hungry companies that make you jump through hoops for the privileged to work with them are just that - money hungry.
They have no integrity behind them as much as they try to pretend they do, how I know? Because they will sell out each and every one of you if they deem you account "suspicious". 
They don't care what you're doing, they only care about saving their ass at your expense.
They'll freeze your account, steal your money basically anything they want to do they will do - all in the name of AML and KYC. The worse part of it? They KNOW this is how it goes! They just pretend to themselves that you are probably a criminal anyway and so you deserve it - this is how they sleep at night.

Sorry, but you are the naive one. Also, anyone buying 50k coins wants the price to go up to make THEMSELVES rich so if they can buy it OTC and leave the price unaffected or buy it in 5 million chunks in a way that WILL affect the price and spark a new rally then guess which method they will choose....
And when you get to the point where private companies in UK or USA are dumping nearly 50 million into the market at once, many others will begin following suit and there WILL a huge price increase "near instantly".
I understand some people do not like to speculate on price increases and to be more grounded, but the above is the VERY thing that will make Bitcoin into what everyone here has dreamed of. Because the kind of people with 50 million spare to invest are the kind of people with wealthy connections across MANY industries.

I might have misrepresented my perspective because I couldn't finish what I was saying. My silly keyboard malfunctioned and cut me off from finishing.
I do not consider the concept of Governments evil, Governments are MEANT to be a clear representation of their people. That is the very concept of government.
My point is very clear and simple, how does the EU in its current form and the decisions made by the non-elected leaders represent the population of its constituent members? The short answer is: It doesn't.
The fact we pretend that the EU, and the countries within, remains a democracy when that absolutely is not the case is a symptom of how people in society today have been manipulated.
It has been a systematic manipulation that begins in school and has instilled into people the "hive" mentality. The "greater good" mentality and to be perfectly honest you are perfectly representative of their success in that respect.
You have not lost a single right or freedom so that we can "leave the galaxy", your rights and freedoms are systematically being removed  so that you continue to put your money (WILLINGLY) into the pockets of the wealthy. 
Society is now ESTABLISHED where people feel their neighbor better "contribute" in the same way they do, less they themselves feel cheated for their own contribution. Then more and more forced contributions were introduced.
But how HAS quality of life changed for the better? EVERYONE in debt? Paying for a house that has had its price artificially inflated to KEEP you in debt? Your Country in debt so there are austerity measures removing MORE benefits from their people. How is it that people are giving more money in "contributions", but are told there is no money and need to get less but give more?
Better health care? Well, there are still Countries using ONLY chinese non-modern medicine that die older on average than USA / UK etc....how does that work?
More morality in society? That is not POSSIBLE to know, I bet many would argue we are just as bad as a human race as we've ever been.
How do we honestly know what it was actually like to live in the past vs. now? We don't, but for some reason you assume you have it so much better now. Truth? Or what you just believe?
Today's society has been carefully moulded to keep us all in the pocket of the wealthy, essentially their slaves and centralizing things just makes it easier to keep track of. The EU is the first step to that centralizing and so naturally - as someone that doesn't want the human race further enslaved - I am against it.
As a final point, I could not give one tiny ounce of concern to the "advancement of human kind" - I care about fairness of the human kind, and that's final.
To put that in context, if we could escape to the next galaxy and have all of these advanced technologies - but the fuel for them was burning humans. Someone like me would say no......but I reckon now days you've have hoards of brainwashed people giving themselves to be used...."for the betterment of the human race". What a joke, you can literally justify ANYTHING when you are brainwashed into thinking along the lines of bettering the human race.

The idea is that they will be permissionless and decentralized.

Gold is being phased out by entire Countries, it is being less and less safe as a store of value. It isn't as though you can hide your possession and then transport 50kg of gold out your Country.
Take India for example, if you are a male and have more than 100g of gold the government will steal the rest off of you.
Imagine them trying to do that with Bitcoin? They can't even prove you have it in the first place and you CAN remove it from the Country if you want.

SARs are out of your league of understanding, with respect.
They are the magic tool that you and most others do not know about and they are the tool to whip your money away from you before you know what has hit you.
Not only that but they won't even tell you a single damn thing about why your money is gone.
Complain all you want, threaten with legal action, they will not give one solitary fuck about you, your money or your threats.
The fun part comes when the SAR report is concluded and they do think they have a reason to suspect you did something.
Remember, this is all without any real evidence.
Well, that is the point they freeze ALLLL your bank accounts at once. THAT'S RIGHT! You can't afford to eat anymore, or pay rent, accept for the 200USD / week they will let you take.
But guess what! They will still let you deposit into the frozen accounts.
Welcome to the 21st century banking regulations, where no money belongs to you.
Most of you won't ever have enough in your bank account for the SARs officers to decide your worth taking down but don't worry, if you ever come into money.....real money........get ready to have your money carefully lifted from you through various fines that you did not even know were possible!
Think I'm bullshitting? Go and ask your local money laundering lawyer specialist how many actual criminals get taken down with this legislation vs legit business people that got caught out by the scam.
These new regulations they are imposing on Bitcoin exchanges, they're just bringing them to the party......Bitcoin is no threat if it joins THIS party ;).

We don't know all the details and certainly would get a one sided view to this. 
The fact you're posting this personal and private information about your relationship online leans me towards you being the immature one out of you both, though.
This is something that is easily discussed between the man and wife, you should both be able to determine the best course of action. If you can't then why are you even together?

More people have all their savings in Bitcoin than care to make public.
I'm talking sensible people with well over 500,000USD in Bitcoin.
In my opinion you are a little late to the 1000USD party as it is taking off within 3 weeks but I would still get on if I was you. It will be 2000USD at some point next year.
The real question is, will you ever choose to cash out? At what point would you? If it was doing so well why would you cash out at all?
These are the real questions.

You said my statement that "Bitcoin has proved itself" was ridiculous, but you don't know what will happen to bitcoin to know if that statement is true or not.
You don't know if it will be between 500USD and 10,000USD for 20 years.
You don't know if it will be between 10,000USD and 1,000,000USD in the next 5 years for the next 20 years.
You are a simple minded and insult people on the internet with no basis what so ever and Lets be clear there is no "science" in using the past to 100% predict the future, so you don't know if the statement is ridiculous or not. Back to the drawing board for you, right kid?

I intentionally put my coins in lots of different wallets back when it was 50c to do so. Now if I want to reorganize its hundreds of dollars in fees, its a fucking joke right now.
I'm 100% pro bitcoin, only own Bitcoin, always hated altcoins, use Bitcoin for basically my life for years, defended Core's road map and I'm one of the few people that actually sold all my BCH and was partly responsible for it's crash...... but if the fees don't go back below a dollar within the next few months I will seriously consider selling for the next best alternative.

BCH is in serious trouble, the EDA needs to be removed with a Hard Fork asap or the inflation and block times will cause the price to crash and the coin will collapse in on itself as the problem compounds. To any of the real holders left you really should get out before the crash/hardfork.

Are you kidding me? The rate at which the coins are released represents the inflation. What would happen to the price if suddenly all 21 million coins became available over night?
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:24:35
Or hyperinflation in this context is most logically and simply using the English language definition: monetary inflation occurring at a very high rate.
"Very high" = anything above what is meant to occur, in the context of Bitcoin, because it is meant to have a set in stone rate of inflation by its very design.
@_date: 2017-01-04 12:58:55
Of course anything is a possibility. But, I have a real faith that Bitcoin is the future of storing wealth off the grid for the entire world.
When I say "real faith" what I mean is, I am almost certain this is what is happening. Why is that a needed thing now? Because governments are financially oppressing their populations more and more.

Didn't cash out the BTC. It's extremely bullish for at least the next year just off the back of Segwit, literally no one should be cashing out right now unless they plan to buy back in "lower".

No no no, 789USD is the worse case scenario unless something terrible happens. Every boom bust has retraced to the original breakout level in Bitcoin and not below. I'm just being optimistic about the next breakout that occurs within 3hrs now.

@_date: 2017-01-31 17:04:17
Tell your bank you are cashing in some stocks and shares and expect a payment from your broker of 100,000USD. 
Find an off the record exchange like 247exchange who will deposit the funds from an international source and take their account details to the bank. Also inform them you will be making a substantial payment to the Tax authority shortly after and to put a note on the account not to freeze the payment. Do this with as many banks as you will need.
Then declare the amount in full to your tax authority and try to find a way to pay the most tax possible on it, pay the tax from each bank account so each account manager will see you are paying tax and not report you.
Finally, make the payments for the house from each account and give the solicitor all the information you gave to the banks originally.
Yeh, fiat is so great.
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:24:41
Maybe there is no study because the answer is so obvious?
@_date: 2017-01-31 17:43:29
The breakout was successful, a nice big green 4hr candle. Now for the pull back, we want to see a strong red candle on the 4hr close having touched 940USD but fail to break below 940USD.
At that point....what can you say, we will be on the way to the moon (1000USD) lol.

Hey, this place does have many weirdos to be completely honest. I end up in arguments more frequently with total odd balls than I'd care to admit. The reality is the normal people are here but are behind the loud mouths.
I seriously considered setting up something similar where I am after reading your original post. Even calculated the ROI etc, but for me the problem is the fact you need 8 solar pannels to run a single ant miner S9 - from my calculations.
Additionally, you would need at multiples of 10 to make a decent annual turn over which is a huge start up cost.
For me the issue is the length of time to make a return, the cost of 8 panels and an ant miner - how long does it take to pay for itself on your calculations? Also what cooling solution do you implement? What if the miner breaks down before paying for itself?
If you'd be prepared to answer I'd GREATLY appreciate it my friend.
@_date: 2016-12-31 12:26:08
Maybe I'm pointing out the obvious, but the triggering factor of the avalanche means far less than the end result.
i.e China starts a move that UK/USA/rest of the world jumps in on.
It isn't possible to say China is solely behind the price move, because it is false.
@_date: 2016-12-22 13:00:20
Haha, nice one.
I got a Chinese supplier to accept Bitcoin about 10 months ago, they always use the same wallet all this time. 
I decided to check it and see how much they received......I shit you not they had WELL over 200,000BTC in that account.
I literally could not believe it, there are some EXTREMELY rich business owners in China working in Bitcoin....but one of these pumps you can probably thank me for...

This is wrong. The size of the "block" will be bigger than 1MB. The base blocksize that segwit is built upon is 1MB but the blocks are no longer measured in MB when Segwit is implemented but in the block "weight". That's why Segwit2x is not Segwit2MB it's just doubling the weight limit.

That would surely just render the mods there with zero credibility in terms of their ability to think critically, they would never take such a risk. Especially considering the "us vs them" situation we are in right now which is entirely based on credibility.

I don't think you should assume it is FUD because you hear things you don't like. What they are saying has a degree of merit.
Segwit is not a scaling fix, Lightning provides a new functionality.....so what about the issue of raising the blocksize?
Blocksize will need to  be raised for Lightning to work, but the blocksize capacity should allow additional space as a buffer to ensure Lightning works correctly and the normal use of Bitcoin can continue efficiently. 
There is no protocol at this time on how we will scale when lightning is implemented, I haven't even seen a single statement on that, which is extremely strange now I think about it. It will be painfully ironic if after lightning we implement  BU. This is coming from someone who has lost probably 1000 reputations in rBTC pushing lightning. 
So this is a serious question we need to be asking.
@_date: 2017-04-05 13:03:38
That is very recent post history for my most recent observations, and they are sincere. If you go further back you'll see at one point I was leaning towards supporting BU and further back you'll find a thread I created on all the positives vs negatives on each protocol which had more than 100 upvotes and if you go back further you'll find me complaining that one of my posts on rbitcoin vanished (later reappeared). 
So to imply that I somehow deserve to be censored because I don't contribute is not true, the mere fact I have almost 1000 karma after 3 months should show I am a serious poster. The fact I almost certainly own more bitcoin than the majority on either sub also means I am part of the economic majority and therefore a part of Bitcoin itself in that respect. Even in the OP it is obvious I am reasonable and sincere, to imply otherwise really is farcical.
My point is rbtc does censor people, while claiming it is terrible to censor people and drumming up support on this basis....well, their stance is a lie and it is important people realize this.

For someone to say Bitcoin is falling, while it is near an all time high and the first ever Country just made it an official currency is completely ridiculous.
To then push ETH, on the basis of all of these inaccuracies, just screams ulterior motive. This is then confirmed at the point where he states "*already* trading at $50" - as though ETH is a completely new thing that has just been released.

Thanks for the detailed response. 
It does appear that your original perspective that Lightning hubs are at risk of being centralized to the point where KYC would be required, full stop, has been nullified by this response though. 
I.e every time one hub got 'hit' by a government in one Country, another hub one would pop up within a day and everyone would be free to move there. There is zero financial incentive to play ball on any government imposed regulation either because it would render the operation non-profitable. On that basis there is no chance of the worse case scenario ever unfolding for LN, forced KYC, from what I can see.

If a miner has 75% hashrate and doesn't need the users to make a decision then that fits in perfectly with your own definition, i.e that is THE central authority.
I'm am a little surprised you couldn't see that as you were writing your response.
The only thing keeping miners in check is the nodes, this concept is core to bitcoin.... this 'fuck the users' idea you have flies in the face of what bitcoin actually is.  
From the white paper:-
Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker.  are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them. * attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back money he recently spent.
The nodes satoshi references are the users running those nodes, the users police the miners. I.e its the users that determine the outcomes. 
I'm guessing you had no clue about any of this, its worth knowing, as you can see.

@_date: 2017-04-02 06:05:27
You'll have to do your own research on this, but there are technical reasons of why it is more secure to keep the blocksize as small as possible and raise slowly over time.
@_date: 2017-04-19 17:17:09
Of course, I reference what is known today. There is no guarantee that it would change, so it is logical to do that and as we know LN right now the blocksize must continue to increase.
The protocol I am referring to: We need the blocksize to increase for LN, so how will we do it? What if there is deadlock for some reason when LN is actually active? It would cause a huge failure of the system.
So as I said, what is the *protocol* that we will increase the blocksize with once LN is implemented? Adaptive blocksize? Hardforks? Softforks? No one has mentioned this and it is completely KEY to the future of Bitcoin right *now*.
 -  No one has an answer, no one even asked yet from what I can tell.

Reading rbtc if your first problem, half of them there, their only goal is to disrupt bitcoins progress because they hold altcoins. The top post there right now is about Ethereum, their mod pumped eth and left that forum trying to take as many as possible with him. They constantly reference percentage crypto market cap to highlight bitcoins 'demise' and constantly reference the 'flippening'. It is actively going on and obvious.
The situation is clear, a miner now wants to take as much influence over the network as possible and vetos everything that doesn't fit his business model.
We were in a situation where we cannot move forward unless we do what this miner wants. Many are happy to do it because they think he will act in our interest.
Segwit and LN mean we no longer have a blocksize issue for a long time. By the time we need another blocksize increase EVERYONE will agree to it and it will happen safely.
There is no stalemate anymore. The users will decide, if the miners try to 51% attack they will get pow'd out.
The debate is essentially over until after the 'vote'.

Blockstream is just a company in the Bitcoin space, the developers of Bitcoin are a group of 150+ independent people that work on the public code. Anyone is free to submit adjustments.
The actual implementations of the code we can all contribute to are decided by the community only, not the developers. However, people in the community obviously have a high degree of trust for the people that have been keeping Bitcoin working for all these years.
Saying that Blockstream proclaim themselves to be "Bitcoin's developer" highlights a very big gap in your understanding of how the development of Bitcoin occurs.

I think some people here need to back off, you have a problem with him when he doesn't do something and a problem when he does it.
Try being positive for once in your life, the community is one step closer to being reunited again and that means the success of Bitcoin. Have you never heard of positive reinforcement? If you all congratulate him and make him popular he will try to appease you again. This is the basis of social skills, that many in Bitcoin clearly severely lack.

LN transactions still get written to the blockchain, not all of them, granted, but if the blocksize doesn't grow to accommodate the "settlement time" then LN doesn't function. 
i.e at the time the LN transactions get written to the blockchain if there is so much delay some get missed off there is a failure in the network. 
Sorry if I didn't explain this concept well, look up "lighting network failure mode" by peter todd.

I was just illustrating the point with the least amount of effort, the real evidence that he is in a minority in being unhappy with this situation is the price of Litecoin shot up immediately after the news. So obviously the majority of the market consider this a positive development and not bad for the future of Litecoin, it isn't possible to dispute on that basis. The sentiment in the r/litecoin forum is also very indicative.

So, anyone that wants to use LN could possibly be forced into an AML situation. I.E to use our hub you need to give your ID.
But, you don't have to use LN if you don't want to. So you could still use BTC to pay for things, provided they used Bitpay or similar, the payment is still instant.
So the effect is, everyone that wants to use LN can, and it will free up the mempool. Everyone that doesn't can continue to use the blockchain as normal.
Therefore if people don't like the way lightning eventually goes, there will be a scenario where we can all raise the blocksize later on.
If LN was proven to be centralized in the end, then users on both sides would be against it and no 'spin' would change that. Not the users or the miners want centralization. So we would have consensus, right?
It appears that we are fighting over what may or may not eventually, result in a degree of optional centralization - when it is not even confirmed - and we can resolve that if it was needed. That doesn't make sense. Both sides of this debate are against one thing, centralization, if LN proved to be centralizing, we would finally be in agreement to make another change. Am I being stupidly logical?

Bitcoin is the decentralized money, if the current system has evolved to something less optimally decentralized then it will be moulded back.
The answer: The millions of users. Therefore, bitcoin decisions need to be decided by the users. Enter USAF.
If miners try to 51% attack, enter pow change.

If you consider that the group of independent developers responsible for keeping Bitcoin alive are referred to as "core".
If you are against "core" and for an entirely new team of developers, you are actually supporting a take over of Bitcoin and I will use an analogy to explain my newly found view.
For example, say Wikipedia is maintained by an independent group of people. If someone came along and said, we want to get rid of all of those people maintaining these articles and replace those maintaining them with our people that all get privately paid to maintain the articles and we will also make some other adjustments to the process used - everyone would immediately recognize that as a complete overhaul of Wikipedia and how it had always functioned.
If that group of people then told you that the original maintainers of Wikipedia were actually hostile to the original project that would be considered ridiculous. It is those people that got it where it was over the course of years.
But the weird part is where the new group try to get support for their perspective by justifying that stance and using it as the sole ploy for their marketing campaign and in doing so creating huge problems within the entire community - while maintaining that they are doing a good thing.

Emin is constantly fudding against Segwit using his status and "intelligence" in this sector as his means to gain trust.
I think it is valuable that people are aware that he has been completely wrong in the past, and it is therefore it is not far fetched that he would be wrong again about something Bitcoin related with respect to his recent assertions.
For example, 11hrs ago:-
"Core devs have lost the intellectual lead in on- and off-chain scaling. That's why they have resorted to attacks on social media."

In many countries to have a credit card you have to put the limit down as a deposit. In these same countries the bank cards only allow you to withdraw from cash-points, you can't use it online.
Therefore ordering online is only possible with a Credit card and these have minimum limits. 1000USD card/3000USD Card 5000USD Card for example. 
In these underdeveloped countries how much of the population do you think are rich enough to put 1k down in a card just to purchase things online? Yeh a very small number.
Maybe in developed countries Credit cards are used, but there are far more people in under developed countries not using credit cards.
Yet, they all have smart phones. Soon there will be a way for them to pay for things online without a CC from the phone. That is Bitcoin adoption.

@_date: 2017-09-16 16:29:11
Ok, I'll bullet point the points I made:-
- The "infighting" was bad actors in the community. The community itself was happy with the upgrade all along.
- The bad actors have been pushing for larger blocks which centralizes power to the largest mining pools, of which are in China. This therefore centralizes the power over the network in China and consolidates the top Chinese pools as the "main" miners and ultimately pushes out smaller operations.
- There have been multiple attempts to force the above to occur, most recently trying to trick the entire ecosystem to BCH by painting its image as the "real" Bitcoin.
- Because the "death chain spiral" didn't occur, which the EDA was meant to cause, maybe it was concluded that the attempts to consolidate mining power in China had failed/China's attempt to commandeer Bitcoin had failed.
- It was decided that Bitcoin therefore needs a different way to be controlled within China, starting with the shutting down of Chinese exchanges.
- This entire thing has played out because miners were inadvertently given the ability to veto changes in the network by abusing the new BIP process which was designed purely to allow the miners TIME to upgrade, not decide whether or not to do it.
- Do not give this option again and risk a similar thing playing out in the future.
As you can see, a lot more was said than "fuck Jihan" and it has absolutely nothing to do with you personally, nor any other miner that didn't abuse the system. I think the Chinese government have been playing a game this whole time. This is my opinion.

Don't we need a global satellite based internet network for this to be fully useful? Does this exist? The internet in my country is censored and slow and I've been looking at ways to receive satellite internet totally independent of the Country and I've found nothing.
Also, how small could you make these receiving dishes? Because if a government just made this process illegal, the one outlined in the OP or receiving internet independent of the Country it would be pretty easy to search someone's premise and find a satellite dish. If the punishment was severe enough people would never do it given how easy they'd be found out.
For this concept to be useful at circumventing government restrictions it would have to be possible to have these dishes working in a way that could not be located in a house search. Nor detectable by a helicopter flying overhead searching for these signals. I don't see how this is possible right now?
Is it literally just to be able to send Bitcoin where you don't have internet, but do have a phone signal...? If you have phone signal generally you have 3G.

1.) Buy pizza with Bitcoin 2.)buy back Bitcoin with exchange fees and likely at a higher rate losing you money
1.) Buy pizza with fiat and save your time and money.

Not really, you don't get anywhere near the proper rate and everything you do on LBC is recorded literally forever.

Ok! You think you come across as really witty and also think that you are of high intelligence.
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:59:24
This is getting a little weird. You didn't really just forget what this entire exchange was about did you?




@_date: 2017-09-20 05:05:49
It's nothing to do with that. It's because of latency issues with bigger blocks that force centralization of miners to the biggest pools. The larger the block the more advantage the largest mining pools have over the smaller operations, it will remove decentralization. That's why it's considered an attack, because it hands power over the entire network to certain individuals in China (right now anyway) and becomes anti-competition. That's why BCH is propped up in China, if it had worked it would have given them total control over the network.
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:17:43
No, not in the US. There are many many Bitcoin debit cards available now, Visa and Mastercard. Also if you type "buy &gt;&gt;item&lt;&lt; "Bitcoin" " in google you should find somewhere and the worse case scenario is using your debit card.

I'm talking strictly financially and I know that I am correct in that respect.

Why would they just ask their current customers? They are entering a NEW market, so that NEW customer's seek them out. 
If they're trying to find if there is a market for Crypto currency, then look at the market cap, its over 100 billion USD and growing.
This sub alone has over 300,000 users, the daily trade volume is multiple billions, Bitcoin is discussed regularly on major news outlets. The market rallied on the build up to the US ETF, is dropped on its failure.

Yeh, to be honest I was skeptical. It was Charlie Lee that confirmed it for me, the JM news seemed to coincide perfectly with that to create the perfect shit-storm. Combine that with the uncertainty of Segwit2x approaching and this was an ideal location to margin short.

@_date: 2017-09-04 15:35:32
Ok, price either moves side ways from here, then build up to 5000USD again. 
Or price moves down from here by an unknown amount, THEN it starts to move sideways and then it builds up to 5000USD again.

Lock in 1m+ profit into the worlds most stable currencies: USD/EUR.

So you invest in gold/stocks/shares.....that all then get outperformed by Bitcoin. 
Property or Bitcoin ONLY. Bitcoin works similar to gold, nearly everything else is tied to the economy, property is too but it is tangible.

If the Segwit2x fork goes ahead there isn't much us normal users can do about it, 2x will just be the new Bitcoin.
As unpalatable as it feels to have a private agreement decide this when users would rather show solidarity with Core and take it more slowly, ultimately, in spite of this if they all keep to the agreement then it will be successful and still mean there is only one Bitcoin. Which was the aim.
I think  as we approach and it becomes clear what will happen one of the sides will just accept the direction and we will carry on as normal, just like we did through every other disruptive occurrence within Bitcoin.
Segwit2x does not "fire" Core in anyway whatsoever. Us users will run Cores software for 2x if it comes out.
Personally I'd rather one side ducked out early and stop the posturing/game of chicken, I'm so fed up of unneeded FUD and it goes without saying that I trust the perspective of Core when it comes to anything technical.

Sorry, I can't make head of tails of this response.
I cannot be convinced that spam is not a problem when it can be used to force everyone to pay higher fees so that these artificially high fees can then paraded around Sub's like rbtc as a reason to switch to a cheaper (scammy) alternative.
I would call people hysterical too if this was being complained about while *not* being effective. But this behavior actually *is* effective on new comers.
On that basis alone every effort should be made to make it harder for it to occur. If Schnorr Signatures make it harder implement that asap, if something else makes it harder implement that asap too.

Some say to do less than you can afford to lose, but then what's the point of investing? With that logic as soon as it starts going up and crosses that little threshold you have to sell....it's literally impossible to make any decent sum of money with that logic. It's like a business, except, they *borrow* money to invest, usually. I'd advise not to do that.

It only gets worse if you enter a topic, the sheer number of obvious shills is incredible. 
If you proceed to post anything, no matter how obviously correct, that goes against the decided narrative of the topic you WILL have your post dissected/your post history investigated/a strawman argument against you...literally anything to discredit you or the statement.

I live full time in this space and I think their logic boils down to this:-
"Miners are the nodes in this system, not users, there is no point and no utility gained in a user running a node. Restricting growth of the blocksize to facilitate people to run a node makes no sense on that basis"
While this makes sense, it is a manipulative strawman commonly implied as the only issue with increasing the blocksize. But isn't, the real issue is the centralization pressures caused by latency. This means only the large miners do well and small operations end up closing, more people join the same pools and these pool leaders then have total control over the entire protocol. It is for THIS reason, that pertains to decentralization, for why big blocks are no good.
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:26:03
Am I incorrect in believing that the cost to perform an equal magnitude of spam attack has not changed from weeks ago to now, when using the legacy transaction format?
Your posts are implying something has changed, in accordance with the above, and I don't believe they have. The cost to create the volume of spam from weeks ago remains the same today, doesn't it?
If we look at the attack today and say "It's not as bad as weeks ago", yet these same people remain with the ability to repeat the attack from weeks ago, today, for the same price.....why are you implying the situation has improved?

They keep accounts literally forever showing all incoming and out going transactions and also they keep your real name logged to the account without any option to remove. 
For two years they lied in their privacy statement AND Terms and Conditions about you being able to delete your account, when you requested they would just say leave it and if you demanded they would bluntly refuse.
Some people threatened them with legal action in their private forum because its against EU and Finnish laws to break your privacy statement while keeping information against request and they finally updated their terms, then deleted the forum posts about it.

Honestly, I say this all the time and no one seems to have a decent response. I actually think Tulips are *more* useful than Bitcoins:-
Tulips are:-
1.) Decentralized - anyone can grow a Tulip
2.) Immutable - it's impossible to go back and change how a tulip looks once its flowered.
3.) Store of value - everyone knows Tulips can't ever go off, or die, or go moldy. So they are good for hundreds if not thousands of years.
4.) Censorship resistant - if someone doesn't like Tulips, who cares.
5.) Easily transferable - want to send a Tulip to Africa from Australia in 10 minutes? No problem, throw it.
6.) Tulips look really nice and represent the latest in mother nature's technology.
7.) Want to transfer 100million USD in Tulips by yourself? Easy, just wear 1000 back packs at the same time full of Tulips.
8.) Updates. Tulips are continually getting new updates and use cases, planting them? So yesterday. I've heard that a way to connect your Tulip stash to your Iphone is in the pipeline as I type this.
9.) Deflationary. Tulips are no longer created, now that 21 million are in existence, there will never be another Tulip bulb created.
I could go on and on, but in short, this was an excellent question and very well thought out. I didn't think the request for serious responses only was necessary though, how could someone possibly take this as a joke?

They keep accounts literally forever showing all incoming and out going transactions and also they keep your real name logged to the account without any option to remove. 
For two years they lied in their privacy statement AND Terms and Conditions about you being able to delete your account, when you requested they would just say leave it and if you demanded they would bluntly refuse.
Some people threatened them with legal action in their private forum because its against EU and Finnish laws to break your privacy statement while keeping information against request and they finally updated their terms, then deleted the forum posts about it.

There is not fighting among ourselves, there were Chinese miners almost certainly partially controlled by their Government blocking our upgrade. Then there was a Chinese funded attempt to create a new version of Bitcoin that had centralizing pressure to push control to the miners in China.....but when both of these attempts to destroy Bitcoin/give China control of Bitcoin failed they simply banned all the exchanges.
The "infighting" is only found on rbtc, and they are mostly paid marketing and people who own altcoins that believe if Bitcoin struggles they get rich.
The only thing to take away from this is not to let miners have any say in upgrades ever again, just like it always had been before Segwit; and ignore rbtc - which everyone does anyway.

Your points are moot as they only apply if we were ever at a stage where everyone, including uneducated border guards, thought a series a random words equals Bitcoin wallet in the same way absolutely everyone in the world knows that gold and notes equals money. We are no where near that and won't be even in 10 years.
Irrespective of the above, think for a second why a foreign person would have a list of random written English words, also with a native language to English dictionary on them....seems pretty obvious they are practicing English. I'd put money on an absolute shitload of them have a notepad with random English words contained within it. Are you going to beat them all up on the off chance 20 of those 2000 words are a secret password? lol. 
Or how about put all of them from every notepad into a brute force wallet cracker along side the rest of the dictionary to guess the remaining words that might not have been written down, for every single immigrant that crosses a border and also happens to be learning English....lol.

I predicted the floppening in rbtc when every single post there was pumping ETH saying Bitcoin was dead and I predicted the regulatory issues with ICOs when they were all saying it couldn't possibly happen. Feels good to be vindicated yet again.
Bitcoin is bouncing off 5000USD like it obviously was always going to and taking alts down with it, useless Ethereum is getting kicked while its down by the SEC/China over their scammy ICOs. Nothing surprising.

No it isn't. rbtc is the new rbuttcoin and has been for the past 6 months+. They despise Bitcoin and want it to die as is evidenced by the posts for MONTHS now. Every other post there is some new form of propaganda to entice people from here to start posting there and to "realize" that Bitcoin is dying and will be replaced by the alt of choice. Then you wonder why you were welcomed?

No it wasn't. The emergency plan was if BIP148 split the chain that a HF would be done to Jihans spec. When BIP148 didn't split the chain he couldn't legitimately deploy the HF. BCH was a "totally new and separate project".


Yes it is, these are meant to be two separate projects. Jihans project never deployed and in rBTC they are adamant that the development of BCH is completely voluntary and that Jihan has nothing to do with BCH and the "mystery miner" was a completely new person/group of people. They do not even entertain that it could have been Jihan.
This ex-employee just openly admitted that Bitmain is supporting BCH, even though Jihan himself stated he had nothing to do with it.
This news is hugely significant because it proves that Jihan has broken the NYA for his personal gain AND lied about it.

This is wrong. I and others I know have had almost all assets in Crypto for more than 2 years. It wasn't a mistake nor an accident. Only people that don't understand their investment say what you've just said, because if someone realized where this space was going, they'd have behaved similarly.
A couple of months ago Bitcoin was at something like 2000USD and someone made a thread "I want to invest all my savings, 20k into Bitcoin". So many people told him not to do it. I told him "Right now is the best time to do it" (obviously in more detail) it got something like 25+ upvotes in a sea of posts like yours above....Bitcoin then doubled in price. 
Bitcoin isn't a stock/share, it isn't a company - its a totally new instrument/utility and even revolution in the eyes of some people. To have fully understood it potential at its inception, with decent capital, was to be a multi-millionaire today - that is a fact.

It's not so clear cut in real life, because Bitcoin wouldn't go to even 1000USD over night and the rules of engagement are essentially made by yourself. You can borrow money again at the bottom, default on the loan but keep the Bitcoins and then file for bankruptcy, move to another Country, basically there's a lot you could do if it didn't work out.
In the real world where rules are not set, just like the above, you would get the guy to agree to multiple turns and approach a group of investors about the game and they would give you 100 million to play with. You are then literally guaranteed to win.

You aren't thinking very clearly about this, because it isn't the case. There are easily scenarios where certain people take over Bitcoin's development and mining and the one that becomes popular eventually completely loses its identity causing the price to crash or you can no longer cash out.

Are you daft or something? It has everything to do with what you're saying. If there is no replay protection implemented anywhere in the system the old chain will be bled dry ensuring there is only one chain. That's literally the reason why they are not planning on using replay protection. To ensure that there is only one version of Bitcoin.

It's difficult to explain but I will try. Price doesn't just move when traders think it will go one way, it moves because people think it will go one way and the people who thought it would go the other way were wrong.
When a breakout occurs long for example you have people entering their position long, propelling price upwards, but you also have people closing short positions also propelling price upwards.
This is called double pressure and it's this that day traders actually trade, myself included, I trade forex professionally.
If all the traders think price will go up, after an extended swing for example, this is not a trade you *should* take. This might not sound like I have written that correctly but I have. It's because there are not enough shorts to propel price upwards on a new break. There is no double pressure if all traders think the same thing. All the traders can think the same thing but price can *still* move against them due to fundamentals. 
Price moves based on fundamentals and also based on speculators, the split in what the traders think will happen often needs to be present for a big breakout to be successful.
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:57:26
I'm not criticizing your position at all, congrats. My post is directed to holders, not traders. If price suddenly turns right now imagine how many people like yourself will be forced to close out. 
This short was so blindingly obvious to call, after this price move and two big bad news', imagine just how many people that don't take profit early will have to close out their short if direction suddenly changes. There are SL's right up to 5000usd right now. This is the 'climate' I was intending to describe, any very big whale or very good news could start this process.

This medium article is bullshit. Calling on the authority of Caixin as a news source, while the article itself is intentionally misrepresenting the very source quoted in the same article! The Caixin states, in its own choice of words:-
"Chinese regulators ordered a halt to all virtual currency trading platforms in the country, acting to further rein in risks related to cryptocurrencies, Caixin learned from a source close to regulators."
But when quoting the source:-
  
**"But the source added that the crackdown targets unauthorized trading at virtual currency exchanges, *rather than Bitcoin*"**
The above quote from the "source" is the small caveat that allows the article writers just to say the market misinterpreted this news when in fact this is directly manipulating the market with misleading reporting.
This quote above states unequivocally that the ban applies to the UNAUTHORIZED trading, which in the context of the ICO ban clearly refers to trading of ICOs. If there was ANY ambiguity remaining it then specifically states Bitcoin is NOT affected.

1.) I was right that you have multiple accounts
2.) I was right that shills don't need to be paid
3.) I'm right about "millions" not supporting these implementations and given how obvious this is you're therefore arguably intentionally not providing impartial information - so this is how I conclude you fit the definition of a shill.

It contributes to the Bitcoin network; it allows you to "vote" for the developers you believe are producing the best software with the best innovation (and therefore their scaling plan) and also keeps the Bitcoin miners honest.

Do an OTC trade with a Chinese company using an offshore account.
Or buy a rare painting in your country, transport it secretly to Macau and buy them there.
I'm assuming you want multi millions worth?
Don't use LocalBitcoins, they break EU and Finnish data protection laws to keep all data on every transaction ever made and all and any personal datas inputted on the website during all trades, forever. They even spent 2 years lying in their own Terms that you could delete your accounts until they were called out for this. If you want a small amount use shapeshift.
@_date: 2017-10-01 11:27:23

It contributes to the Bitcoin network; it allows you to "vote" for the developers you believe are producing the best software with the best innovation (and therefore their scaling plan) and also keeps the Bitcoin miners honest.

I literally outlined why one was better than the other in the same sentence. It saves you time AND money using one option over the other.
Also, bare in mind this is coming from someone that does not even have a fiat bank account. I bet you do. But I won't complain that you're turning your back on BTC....it's just because right now it is easier for you. In that same way right now it makes sense to try and save your Bitcoin where possible. Viciously insulting someone who suggests this is not nice.
@_date: 2017-10-01 14:43:33
All of this makes sense. Well written.
I was a really really strong advocate for 2x when it was proposed, the idea of a compromise fit perfectly. I was even arguing directly against prominent members of Core about it.
Then came BCH which utterly sabotaged the entire concept of a compromise and completely insulted all the people like myself mature enough to have supported a compromise in the first place.
At this point I think the silence speaks volumes, those involved in the agreement are plodding along for agreements sake. No one wants to be the first to break their word for fear of it being used against them in the future.
One prominent company needs to stand up for what's right here and renegotiate the Hard Fork to a later date. Core *should* be included in this negotiation if we really want to keep the entire community together from this point onwards.
Now that all the "special guys" in the community forked off to that EDA disaster (BCH) the rest of us should make some effort to work together again.

I was thinking this earlier, who exactly is buying these Bitcoins that all the Chinese population is presently selling? The exchange? What for? This could essentially be the Chinese Government stealing Bitcoins from their population, then forcing them to rebuy at a higher price later on when they re-regulate exchanges and permanently open them.

I was very pro Segwit2x initially as "the compromise", I seriously would never have imagined that they would fork to an altcoin (BCH) and start calling for the death of Bitcoin. I really have no idea what to think anymore except to accept that Jihan Wu and his buddies, including Roger Ver have seriously malicious intent. Rather, put their business and "domination" ahead of all else.
If China does ban exchanges though, BCH will die almost overnight, which is the only good thing that will come of a ban.
@_date: 2017-10-02 04:44:38
Split them with their guide, send all the BCH to Bitfinex and sell them directly for BTC and move back to Trezor. Some of you have left it a bit late, probably 90% of BCH belongs to Jihan and his associates by now, if they give up propping it up its headed down extremely quickly.

It raises awareness, so it quite obviously does.
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:34:13
My point is that some people realize that an innovation that will catch-on from day 1 and others don't. Some people get behind these innovations 100% from day 1. Other's treat them like traditional investments and miss out as a result.
This is only natural, it's just ironic when those who didn't recognize the potential then pretend that anyone who did *must* have been a dumb gambler....even when the outcome was almost completely predictable. 
Edit: For example, Forbes just said Bitcoin just displaced Gold. I and others have thought this would happen for years. The more this thought becomes mainstream the more you can imagine BTC capturing part of Golds market cap. This is something that right now I am talking about potentially years before it will occur and it will be possible to watch this develop into a reality if you know where to look and what to look for. If you see this about to happen what do you do? Invest 5%? No way...

I am extremely surprised to see who this reply came from. 


The fact that it is so easy to spam the mempool and artificially raise the transaction fees as a means to push certain agendas. You might call it being "hysterical" but if it achieves what its designed to do, push people away from Bitcoin, give weight to stupid voices in rbtc then anything that can be done should be done to make it harder for these people. If you can't work out a way to do that then that's why you should say, not just pretend it isn't an issue. The fact that it occurs so regularly IS the testimony to it being too easy to do.


Obviously, they're paying a lower fee than you and it meant you had to pay a higher fee, this is the problem we are discussing, isn't it - easy to create spam artificially forcing this higher fee.
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:27:49
I'm not going to insult you for your beliefs. But the fact you are in a minority, and I mean a tiny minority, that doesn't consider BCH a bad joke says more to convince the last of its real supporters like yourself than I ever could.
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:15:09
Yes, I was very much in support of Segwit2x, I don't reference this in the above post as it's about BCH. However, I no longer actively support Segwit2x because some miner's (significantly involved in NYA) forked off creating, and then propping up BCH, while pretending it had nothing to do with them - causing the very chain split the compromise was meant to prevent. 
I'm actually more against Segwit2x than neutral because after all the stick we got from both sides, as rational people who were prepared to meet in the middle, we have been totally mocked.

@_date: 2017-09-18 19:08:07


What are you talking about? I do trust Core, I literally said that at the end of the post you are replying to. There is no fight to be had here, if the agreement goes ahead without replay protection 2x IS the only Bitcoin. What I want to happen or argue for with people on here cannot change that, it's the nature of Bitcoin's design.
I DO prefer 2x to just fall through, because of the nature of the agreement excluding important developer's and user opinion and because I don't want certain members of Core to throw a tantrum over it and "quit" Bitcoin in "protest". 
Where do us users actually get a say here? We are in between a rock and a hard place with this bullshit now.

Great! Start studying, find a good course to cover all the basics, try to focus on naked charts and not so much on indicators.
Then I would strongly strongly recommend reading Bob Volman's books on Scalping once you have the basics down. His technical analysis is absolutely the gold standard. He also has a dropbox analyzing a few years of charts on the EURUSD every-single-day. 
Don't start practicing until you feel you are an expert, but when you want to start, use real money on a micro-lot account right off the bat so you can really understand from the beginning the stresses.

If you commit to buying Bitcoin you cannot run tail between legs at any sign of volatility. You buy and hold, or buy and then buy future dips.
Trying to time the market will eventually make you lose, trying to sell at the top will eventually make you lose. If you're going to invest, you have to be committed.

I don't really follow what you're trying to say. But BIP148 with majority node support will ultimately force miners to switch to the segwit chain, that is how it is possible for there to be no chain split with a UASF.

Happy to hear your view. I am hopeful with Segwit/Lightning + other layer 2's and raising the blocksize where needed is more than enough to keep the original vision of Bitcoin alive.
I think after a couple of years of arguing we really have found the very best way to move forward. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:02:58
I'm not sure where you got this information or idea from, other than the fact it could be *plausible*. But it is far more likely that the idea was to sit big players down and find the basis for compromise in order to move forward - this was achieved with this agreement.
I don't really know where people, on both sides, get off on trying to extrapolate all this other -  negative - information from one of the most positive developments with respect to consensus within Bitcoin in the last 12 months.
It has been agreed to, by all the major players, that if we can get BOTH 2mb HF and Segwit then we are all in agreement and we can move on.
The problem is, some of the users are so used to arguing and fighting that it has become habit. They *want* to continue in-fighting like its some kind of hobby, well, these people need to **fuck off**.
(Feels strange swearing, never used that word here before lol)
@_date: 2017-05-24 06:50:31
Wow, I was starting to think I was the only one thinking this....I was just called delusional for essentially saying that this is the compromise we've been waiting for. It is, everyone on both sides already said they want 2mb and Segwit, then they get it and some odd balls on both sides still complain: "No, I only want Segwit!" "No 2mb is useless, 8mb!"......These people are dysfunctional.

There won't even be a chain split with consensus behind bip148. It needs only 51%+ support. It is *impossible* to be easier or safer than this, the only limitation is the time frame. If we pull our fingers out of our ass and actually show some real conviction this should not be difficult at all.

Roger has his own agenda, if he wanted he could assist in a resolution very easily, he has a lot of followers, yet he just bitches about Core endlessly. Even his presentations to get people to run BU are not why BU is *good* but literally just why Core is *bad*. Every-time it looks like consensus will be reached, putting an end to the debate, he starts fear mongering and bitching more with posts like you've print screened. There is a *clear* pattern to his behavior. 
I used to think he was innocent in his actions, but now I really don't since spotting this pattern and seeing his lack of constructive action, I think there is more to his behavior and it could be something as simple as he holds a hell of a lot of ETH or another altcoin which benefits directly from Bitcoin "stagnating".

This proposal is the only way a scaling solution can be acheived *without* a chain split. The threshold is 51% and there will be no chain split.
Even with a hardfork with 80% consensus for either segwit or bigger blocks the fact there will always be die hard opposers on the other side means you will get a permanent chain split with each side competing for the status of "real" Bitcoin. This is literally the *only* mechanism that can prevent it that we have available.

I'm not right every-time. I'm right about 70% of the time which means if I only enter a trade with a risk reward ratio of 1:2 with 2% of my account balance risked each time, then every 10 trades I make +22% of my account balance as an average.
Even if you're only right 60% of the time you still make 16% profit every 10 trades with the above model as an average.

I personally think this is as healthy as its ever been, there are real fundamental reasons for this price increase. This is the first time a Country has made bitcoin legal tender, this is the first time ever there will be mass adoption. There has *never* been a more appropriate time for the price of Bitcoin to rise. Not only that but its possible the scaling AND fee issue of Bitcoin will be resolved in 2 months time - what more reason is there to be bullish about the price? Looking at the chart, the market agrees.

Every **swing** has a **correction**.

1. There is more than twice the capacity in Segwit so there could be less than half the hash power on the new chain and it would still work faster than the legacy chain. So, yeh, you're likely to be wrong on that. The new chain will quickly be faster.

They'd buy the maximum BTC and maximum ETH, then move both out, sell the ETH for BTC on BTC-E (e.g) and move both to their own wallet.
Also, okcoin not trading ETH doesn't make a difference. It's for people who just moved out of BTC and into ETH see this news and it revives some of their lust for BTC rallys lol. It's speculation on my part, but ETH is over bought by about 200USD anyway hehe.

It looks like Jihan is on the way to owning the Bitcoin ecosystem now. He indirectly said recently that this was his plan, I thought it was a long term plan.
One CPU was meant to be one vote, but then it became one big business/one big mining operation equals one vote. Now one person is essentially producing all the ASICS and the same person is buying all the businesses.
If we go with BU, that puts even more power in one persons hands. If we go with Core we are being 'manipulated by blockstream and banks'. Even Core members are not in agreement with each other anymore, e.g Luke says BIP 148 Greg says BIP 149.
This has become ridiculous, yet the figure heads in the field seem more intent on pairing up with each other for personal profit. But the price keeps rising, thank god. Maybe this is Bitcoin working as intended? God knows, honestly I'm confused.

@_date: 2017-05-19 17:04:54
We are just discussing semantics, because I understood you to mean we have no chain split if there is a hard fork supported by a majority. A majority even with 90% still involves a chain split as I can see you appreciate.
I think the key difference here is, if we hardfork to segwit there are people who would refuse to follow that chain even if we got 80% support (die hard BU supporters). There would be two Bitcoins both thinking there's was the 'real' one and for the first time there would be a tangible split in the community.
But with this bip148 if there is a majority before or even after activation there will be no chain split, because the old one will be totally killed off. In this scenario the people who *can* agree, prevent those with antisocial personality disorder/ulterior motives disrupting the progress.
Then we can just move on to all support a 2mb blocksize increase which will appease the big blockers and may bring trust to both sides. This is my personal preference.

I'm surprised this concept is so difficult for you guys to understand. I buy Bitcoin with my friends, there are four friends and we each have 5000BTC each.
We arrange that on 3 exchanges we will periodically open a 2000btc sell order each, each 2000btc sold will drop the price a set amount of USD, maybe 100USD at the top, for example within a single minute. Once the price travels the full way down the next friend will sell, then after the next crash down the third sells crashing the price further. 
This process triggers the stops on various peoples buy orders on all the exchanges, causing the price to continue down, then the newest weakest money sees the price crashing a few hundred in minutes and start selling to prevent further loss. 
As more people panic and sell the price drops further and faster causing more people to panic and sell, at the first retracement, when everyone's buying their 'cheap coins' the fourth friend initiates his sell order, of 2000btc and the price crashes through all the new stop losses of the recent buy orders. Then traders see the real top has formed and they all open their sell orders. More panic selling ensues.
There have been multiple failed attempts at this on the way up to the peak, this one worked. The people responsible for starting the crash like this would have made *millions* each, then they buy back in at the bottom. 
So to the two clever guys that wrote "mathcheck" to my comment, now you understand.
EDIT: I did not have anything to do with this, I did not sell even a single Bitcoin. It is just an example of how people would work together.

I've just been investigating ETH a bit more, I feel as though you're still kind of a Bitcoiner so I can trust your perspective. Honestly, I'm finding the whole thing extremely fishy. I won't go into details of why that is.
Do you know of any successful companies running off of Ethereum? I mean, its been 2 years (?) so that is more than enough time. Everyone is *saying* they will make companies with it and *saying* it will do all of these great things...but who has actually *done* things with it and been successful? 
In 2016 this came out, none of them achieved anything, I can't find *anything more* about companies using Ethereum successfully. I'm literally leaning towards this being some kind of scam to get people away from Bitcoin:-
Please help me to understand.

P2SH, the soft fork which enabled multisig (now ubiquitous), was activated via a UASF with miners trying to block it then too.
"Right now, it looks like one person/pool (Tycho/deepbit) has enough hashing power to veto any change. I believe Tycho liked, and planned to support, the original OP_EVAL proposal, but doesn't like/support either BIP 16 or BIP 17 (he does like/support BIP 11, the multisignature-as-standard-transactions part of all this), so unless he changes his mind or there is a mass exodus from his pool short, multisignature bitcoin addresses will have to wait."

Microsoft's USP was ease of use, Linux never came close.

@_date: 2017-05-31 05:18:52
Eth is just a speculative investment, I have considered it many times. But I just can't get behind it, some nerdy leader that essentially controls the movement, they split because they go hacked, everyone's buying the tokens yet there is no real uses for them yet, the tokens are probably securities and could get investigated in the US at any point, it will have its own scaling issues, its not even intended as a store of value.... it just makes no sense to me.
It seem clear to me that the people who 'diversified' are just trying to make money, Bitcoin isn't just about that. But when Bitcoin resolves their scaling issues, ETH will be bumping into them. Its pretty glaringly obvious that if eth didn't already crash by then, ten at this point it will be finished in terms of its price......and that's ok for them because they'll just say it was never meant to store value anyway.

Yes, that is better. but I think the question itself might bring a degree of contention. I don't think there should be a target demographic at all, in fact I'm quite strongly against that - because this concept is like a marketing concept well within the same lines that a bank would approach this topic.
Bitcoin isn't just savings mechanism, nor a hedging or investment mechanism, nor a payment processor - it represents an ideology which is ALL inclusive except for one group of people - those running the current systems.
Some might take exception to asking this question as it seems to position yourself closer towards the type of people that would typically ask such a question, i.e management in banks trying to mold a service. There should be no target demographic because it should not exclude anyone that wants to use it.
Bitcoin is for everyone and its original plan was to assist the unbanked in a p2p payment network that is decentralized, low fees are the first priority. High market cap brought upon by use cases enabled through low fees will provide the stability and the high price.
For this reason I would say a third world country, from your list. Any scaling option that cannot provide the above is not a solution.

That's true. But in the code does the base blocksize change from 1mb? No. Presently, it is this parameter that defines the blocksize and we are just changing the rules so more than 1mb of data fits in that same block size.

I support Segwit and lightning 100%, but I don't want Bitcoin to split in a dangerous way. 
What happens in that scenario where it garners only 10% support for example? Is the split in the chain going to destroy the price like a hardfork split would do? Will it actually create two bitcoins like a failed hardfork would?
@_date: 2017-05-20 13:31:47
If the majority consider something to be an altcoin, it essentially becomes an altcoin - which is part of the concept of Bitcoin. rbtc, with 600 users at a busy time and some consider Segwit to be an altcoin. rbitcoin, with 4000 users at a busy time, almost ALL consider BU to be an altcoin......therefore, at this time, BU is an altcoin.
This sub's *rules* is that you can't promote a client that removes power from the users, considering BU thinks that users should be 100% powerless in Bitcoin and shouldn't even run nodes, it is pretty obvious why discussing their protocol would be against those rules.
The few that have a problem with this went off to rbtc, as you can see clearly from the numbers, that isn't many. But is also clear most of rbtc are there to pump ETH and fud Bitcoin anyway and many just go there for a laugh, like I do. So the real number of people that think we should promote clients that remove power from the users is *verry* little.

No you don't, you don't know a single thing about me...and do you have some kind of contrarian/grandiose complex? My last three posts you have disagreed with, according to you:-
1.) The bitcoin market has not had one "swing" since the up-trend began, 2 months ago, because it can only be a parabolic curve. Because you say so.
2.) Finbonacci has had nothing to do with the Bitcoin chart for the past couple of months, because again, its a parabolic curve. Because you say it is.
3.) Options are less risky than normal trading, because you say so, even though it is completely accepted that options are more complex, higher return and higher risk. 
Please, just give it a break already.

Many have experienced oppression from their government's and banking sectors in the World. They freeze all your bank accounts and make you prove sources of funds completely disrupting your life for no good reason, they freeze your merchant accounts and destroy your business, the banks are insecure and get hacked often and people lose trust in that security, the economies fail and banks steal money from the bank accounts of people in the country, they won't let you send money to certain countries, they won't let you send certain amounts out the country or receive certain amounts into the country. Governments are introducing more oppressive taxing systems like double tax for some things which is just stealing from the population, governments are confiscating assets like gold in some countries if you have more than 100g, Governments are devaluing their currency and making life savings worthless overnight then turning off the ATMs so you have no money at all, they are eliminating the largest denominations of cash in some countries causing people to lose their savings and livelihoods if they don't have a bank account. Governments are making it legal to instantly hack phones and personal computers without needing a warrant making your bank information even more insecure, they are trying to force backdoors into various software to remove encryption making your credit card details even more available to international hackers. They are planning to make a completely cashless society in some Countries which would mean all the money you earn and save would be digital and can literally be turned off at the push of a button and you could do *nothing* about it.
Bitcoin solves all of these issues for billions around the World, maybe you have not personally faced any of these first hand. But if you  type each one into google you'll find out how many billions around the world suffer from the aforementioned issues - and it is getting worse. Probably the only one you've even heard of  as an example is Paypal freezing business accounts and causing entire businesses to shut down for no reason. It happens daily.
Now, as I said maybe this doesn't affect you yet. So why would you be interested in Bitcoin? Well, it is a new tech that solves a lot of problems for a lot of people and it is in its infancy. You might not have a particular use case for it right now, but others clearly do, so for you it is just a once in a life time investment. 
If Bitcoin achieves even 1% of what people expect it to, it will be worth 10,000USD within 10 years and some professional analysts have said each coin could easily be worth 500,000USD in 20 years.
Now consider, many bought in at 10USD 50USD 200USD 500USD and still see its adoption increasing and its use cases expanding as governments around the world become more oppressive. The billboard is just a hint to a tiny proportion of people lucky enough to see it right now, that this is *big*.

Yeh, I wish rbitcoin and rbtc would team up. I don't think some people realize how much sentiment influences the price, so when you see the top post here with that silly chart that makes it look like Bitcoin is going to go to 1000USD it is extremely counter-productive.

But I don't think it is, Bitcoin has weathered literally everything up to this point and kept raising. 
The only thing it hasn't is a chain split and I've just found out now that in 2 months there will apparently be one. 
It got 6% support in 2 months, you need another what, 50% in 2 months for this to be SAFE? But you spent 2 years complaining over the safety of a Hardfork? I hope I mistaken about something here, or overestimating the effect this will have but if I'm not this behavior will get a REAL backlash from people like myself.

As we approach 80-90% to lock in price will begin its rally. At lock in price will take off, when it loses steam, it will then range or dip until actual activation. As it activates is anyone's guess. But will be be over 3000USD by then, so who cares?

Schnorr signatures
@_date: 2017-07-23 08:37:01


No it doesn't. 


Segwit changes the transaction format, it stops using traditional mb block sizes and uses weight limits instead. Deploying Segwit on 1mb bocks gives the effective blocksize increase immediately to roughly 1.7mb. To "increase the blocksize" from this point becomes something different too, the hardfork proposed *still* doesn't increase the blocksize, it just doubles the weight limit of Segwit. The blocksize forever remains at 1mb. Even if we hardfork to 2x, where the *effective* blocksize is now potentially 8mb it was still deployed on 1mb throughput (blocksize). So, as I said, Segwit is **not** a blocksize increase. 
If you hardforked first to 2mb blocksize therefore doubling the size of the actual block and then deployed Segwit all the same as above applies, with different figures (larger) but still at the end of it all the blocksize remains at 2mb. Getting it? Shouldn't downvote me when I'm teaching you something and stopping you from spreading misinformation.
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:17:32
Wouldn't all proposals begin that way? Or, when they release the 'perfect' protocol we should expect support to go from 0 to 51%+ instantly.

Please stop spreading FUD, you've already admitted that you think LN will work to take small transactions off chain. That's what it intends to do.

How are you not able to work this out yourself? Bitcoin, right now, is the most valuable asset class in the world, by far. In a world where governments click their fingers and empty your entire life savings, or banks freeze your account leaving you stranded for weeks on end for no reason, or governments monitor and limit international transfers, central banks completely devaluing your currency in to nothing, governments confiscating all your gold, taking notes out of circulation with barely any notice causing you to lose huge sums of money, the entire process of creating a cashless society and what that entails... bitcoin is the ONLY way to keep money that is yours, yours.
You can send it anywhere, access it anywhere, you don't need storage, it isn't heavy, you can pass it on to anyone and it can never be taken from you.
If you don't have a use for Bitcoin its because either you don't realize how precarious fiat and normal assets can be now days or you do but you don't *have* any real sum of money to make use of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the new offshore account, but with many, many, many added benefits.
The fact is the tuned in people recognize what will happen to fiat eventually but when the normal people try to leave, there will be no money left for them. The 'bank run' will result in all banks closing down and the atms switching off, this is well anticipated by many important people if you look it up. It already happened in some countries.
Think its impossible? It almost happened in 2008 and many say its a worse situation already, waiting to pop.

@_date: 2017-05-28 07:16:02
Neither do I, from yesterday:-
To be honest TA isn't meant to be used to predict anything anyway, I only did it on reddit for a laugh. TA simply allows you to find areas on a chart where there is a lot of market indecision, in these areas you have a lot of amateur traders confused about the price direction. Many think it will go up, many think down. They are all in position and hoping and praying price goes their way. What we do is find these areas, then when the market decides the "correct" direction we trade the breakout which not only includes new people jumping in on the breakout direction....but also the poor guys jumping out of their losing trade, when they close their position it pushes price in the other direction (if they bought, they sell to get out). So, there you can see extremely basic logic on how it is possible to trade professionally. TA is just a part of it, but a critical part.
If you are not pulling my leg, then I am very impressed. But on here I have done a little research on people's claims in the past and found them to be *completely making things up*. So forgive me for not entirely believing you on probably the wildest claim I've ever heard on here, ever.

@_date: 2017-05-28 06:34:21
You'd think as a "market maker" you'd appreciate the fact that markets can be considered many ways at once and if enough "wrong" people think something, it becomes true - especially in such a thin market where only a few hundred BTC move price at times.

Thanks for addressing the question. I do appreciate this concept, but it makes the assumption that Bitcoin stays small and I think if it does stay small we already know how they will attack us - with over bearing KYC which we've worked through anyway.
If Bitcoin doesn't stay small and entire Countries have money in Bitcoin then they will all run nodes, USA can't bully Russia or China, nor could these countries out hash-power each other.
This is the reason why I'm not sure forever running on Pis really means anything at all, the same people running Pis could run on mid range computers past 8mb blocks anyway. Thoughts?

Thanks for the detailed information, so where are you going to now? To ETH? I think in 6 months time if there is still somehow a total dead lock then I would have to reconsider. But I just don't see a viable alternative to Bitcoin in any of the altcoins right now, personally. Its a speculative investment based on the possibility of Bitcoin "failing" and the "flippening" occurring. 
You said:-


The mainland Chinese culture is that they will ignore threats until it actually becomes imminent, then they bend over backwards to keep the custom possibly going against everything they had told you previously if it means it saves them or makes them money. This is just how the culture works there.
The problem is not that miners exist that want to maintain the status quo because they see it as working well for them. The real problem is that the most vocal people in the crypto space (I can only assume) appear to be people obsessed with conspiracy theories that severely lack social skills and are *extremely* egotistical. As soon as they get frustrated they throw their toys out the pram, tell everyone Bitcoin is doomed to fail and be extremely vocal their move to an altcoin (usually ETH). But this isn't the problem. 
The *real* problem is these people then make it their life mission to try and convince as many people as possible to do the same. This involves endless FUD posts which just frustrates everyone and polarizes the community further.
BUT, if the "impossible" happens and Bitcoin does fix the scaling issue - to the dismay of those who dumped their Bitcoin, because they were wrong - then the money will come piling back in *instantly* and ETH will absolutely crash. So what do you trust more? That Bitcoin will, or won't scale? It is impossible to *really* know, stranger things have happened.

There's no market uncertainty right now, the entire market is waiting for the next lock in to break 3000USD. Then the entire market is waiting for activation to begin the new bull run. The price is **highly** unlikely to go below 2500USD before this occurs. Anyone saying differently is almost certainly intentionally FUDding. Bitcoinabc/cash is an absolute *nothing*.

The extent of your arrogance/ignorance is shocking.
If 80% of nodes will only process Segwit blocks then miners are FORCED to mine Segwit blocks to be able continue to exist as a Business, **whether they initially supported the upgrade or not**. This is the *concept* of a user activated softfork.
What about this is difficult for you to understand? How many times does this need to be explained to you before the concept of user activated softfork finally sinks into your head?
Or are you saying "Well, if all the miners just decide to keep mining blocks on the minority chain even if it is for a loss then there will still be a chain split"? Yeh, then they'll close down. Seriously, what a dimwit.

No it isn't, its an "effective" blocksize increase by freeing up space in the same sized block by removing signatures and it is only feasible where it is utilized (user choice, although discounted).


In my post I asked for real reasons; firstly, you assume you know more about this than myself when based on your first sentence you don't seem to understand what Segwit is. But then you go as far as to admit you don't even know if the HF in 2x is even a potential issue and this in direct response to my asking for **real** reasons why doubling the weight limit or a 2mb blocksize would centralize Bitcoin. Your answer is actually "I don't know", why respond? 
So again, I'm looking for anyone with a **real** reason of why a 2mb blocksize or doubling the weight limit of Segwit will centralize Bitcoin. As I said I cannot find a *single* real reason against it other than "its harder to run a node on a Pi"....that isn't a reason.

BIP148 sounded like a terrible idea. Everyone knows that. But we got to a point where something **had** to be done or simply put nothing would ever get done.
The outcome of BIP148 is that we got our resolution, which is Segwit2x, you can disagree with Luke's promotion of 148 but at the end of the day he was the one that made it popular enough to get the Chinese miners shaken enough to actually agree to Segwit.
I completely respect Greg's conservative nature and the fact he clearly wants what's least disruptive for Bitcoin but there comes a time when doing nothing and advocating for nothing realistic actually causes harm.

You are so ignorant of this process it is comical, this isn't about miner support that's why the *name* is UASF. Because it is **user** activated. 
Softforks were the way upgrades were always implemented in Bitcoin, miners tried to block upgrades in the past and they failed! 
P2SH, the soft fork which enabled multisig (now ubiquitous), was activated via a UASF with miners trying to block it then too. You have clearly been lead up the garden path about your understanding of how this all works, you have a lot to learn so stop feigning frustration that *others* don't get this process when it is yourself that doesn't.

@_date: 2017-05-22 18:55:53
To be honest TA isn't meant to be used to predict anything anyway, I only did it on reddit for a laugh.
TA simply allows you to find areas on a chart where there is a lot of market indecision, in these areas you have a lot of amateur traders confused about the price direction. Many think it will go up, many think down. They are all in position and hoping and praying price goes their way.
What *we* do is find these areas, then when the market decides the "correct" direction we trade the breakout which not only includes new people jumping in on the breakout direction....but also the poor guys jumping *out* of their losing trade, when they close their position it pushes price in the other direction (if they bought, they sell to get out).
So, there you can see extremely basic logic on how it is possible to trade professionally. TA is just a part of it, but a critical part.

Its pretty clear to me what was happening now. The mempool was being actively bloated for political reasons. They wanted to cause havoc and discredit certain people in Bitcoin that said "we don't need 32mb" blocks for Bitcoin to scale.
They now want the urgency for Segwit to die off because it is "no longer needed now" that the mempool is almost empty. In other words they actively don't want us to have Segwit implemented for some reason.
It isn't possible to know who was doing this and their real motivation, you might say it was big blockers that want huge blocks so miners have more power. But you could also easily say it is any bad actor that just wants Bitcoin to fail, for "fiat" reasons by a Government or "altcoin" reasons so Bitcoin fails and we all go to &gt;insert altcoin&lt; or another reason we could not guess.

Spending days reading something then assuming you understand it in its entirety is misguided. I've been personally following the situation on an almost hour by hour basis for months and months.
As far as I'm concerned there is no risk of the original chain split anymore, the original concern was BIP148, that was before Segwit2x even existed. Then the risk was a split from BIP148 then a contingency plan split if Segwit2x didn't activate. It is almost certain that Segwit2x will activate without issue, the software came out yesterday and there's already support from the most high risk pool, antpool. The signalling intent is over 90% now.
So what fork are you actually worried about when every single parameter indicates a completely smooth upgrade to Segwit? There is literally only a *single* "unknown" right now and even that isn't really an unknown, Bitcoincash/Bitcoinabc which ViaBtc will allow trading of on Aug 1st. 
This is the most centralized proposal in existance, you can only trade it on 2 exchanges and only 1 or 2 pools will even supoprt it - honestly, what kind of economic support will that achieve just after we get the upgrade we've been waiting for, for 2 years.
You've just moved your money out of Bitcoin in time for probably *the best* investment opportunity that has ever existed for Bitcoin, assuming you're serious, and have completely misjudged the situation - at this time, taking into consideration most recent events.
I called the consolidation period of 1800USD a couple of days ago, it touched 1800USD and didn't consolidate sideways at all, it raised 400USD in 2 days due to the news events. Honestly, you've completely misjudged this situation based on your post.

3.) They developed a fix.
4.) They are preparing to deploy it, but it will be implemented by the latest August 1st.

Not to be negative but he did no such thing, he merely stated that he thinks the activation of Segwit by any means will cause everything else on the table to fizzle out....
Also, does anyone have any real information on how 2mb blocks would "centralize" Bitcoin, I don't want to hear about how it makes it slightly harder to run a node, I want a real reason. It seems some genuinely think doubling the weight limit of Segwit via hardfork will actually centralize Bitcoin, but I can't see anything that corroborates this. I mean, I've found literally nothing concrete at all so far. I'm revisiting this as a possibility against my earlier judgement, to be blunt it sounds more like Core is just against a Hardfork precedent rather than anything else and some in the community just agree with whatever they say without really understanding what they are saying.
It seems to make more sense that the actual concern is that if we hardfork to raise the throughput then we set a precedent and nothing stops us from just continuing to raise it more and more in the future each time we get a spam attack on the mempool?

No it isn't. Currently, the block size limit is 1,000,000 bytes (1MB). Transactions are measured in bytes. With Segregated Witness, the block size limit is no longer measured in bytes. Instead, blocks and transactions are given a new metric called "weight" as I explained before.
A block has a maximum weight of 4,000,000. A typical byte in a transaction weighs 4. A witness byte in a transaction weighs 1.
The block size limit is multiplied by 4 to give you the new block weight limit. Each byte in a transaction is then also multiplied by 4 to give you a transaction weight. However, you only multiply the bytes of witness data by 1, which basically gives you a 75% discount on how much space it takes up in a block.
Unlocking the witness data takes up 1/4 of the space it used to, which frees up more space in the block for transactions.
I thought explaining it with an analogy would help you to understand what's actually happening, but instead you just say "that's wrong". Sorry, but it is clear you don't really have any clue what you're talking about. Segwit frees up space in the same size block. The analogy provided is EXACTLY what is happening. 


Wrong again. Increasing the blocksize can only be done via a Hardfork. Or this constant will remain:-
static const unsigned int MAX_BLOCK_SIZE = 1000000;
Raising this number raises the blocksize, this cannot be done without a hardfork. Segwit is not a hard fork. It does not amend or remove any rules....this value, which represents the base blocksize upon Segwit's implementation will not be changed. Just like I've been trying to explain to you.
Raising the blocksize would apply to ALL nodes, i.e Bitcoin's blocksize has gone from 1mb to 2mb - Segwit only increases the capacity for those running it. 
The only way Segwit is a blocksize increase is if you totally change the definition of blocksize. Even if you change the definition and say, "well its kind of a blocksize increase for those running it" - that *still* doesn't fit the definition of blocksize, because the blocksize is something that applies to ALL nodes ALL the time.

BitcoinABC is *the biggest* joke I've ever heard of. This is Jihan's logic:-

2.) States still happy to implement Segwit per HK agreement for 2 years
3.) Agrees to Segwit in Segwit2x 
4.) ....but if the *users* implement Segwit, he wants out. That isn't reasonable behavior - why?
Because it's all just a game so he feels important and like he is influencing the space in some form, that he's negotiating the resolutions and compromises. It's the typical inflated ego behavior from someone who is forced to concede but doesn't want to lose face. The irony is, while he maintains "face" in China by still looking relevant he looks like a total joke to everyone in the West - I wish there was a way we could get him to understand this.

Weird article, they already implemented all of these controls in exchanges and it doesn't even matter if some exchanges didn't. 
Just because an exchange will send you 50kUSD worth of Bitcoins doesn't mean when it arrives in your bank account your account won't get frozen. Simply put, it will.
So, yeh this article should have been written about 5 years ago before the banks got strict on AML.

I can literally go on and on and on and back up everything I said with hundreds of links if I want to. You asked "Why are people buying Bitcoin? No one has a good reason." - I told you why and you told me to "shut the fuck up" when you realized there is an extremely important reason why people are buying it.  
One can only assume you are some immature teenager, with borderline learning difficulties and some kind of anti-social personality disorder.
If there is a real financial crisis and your mommy and daddy have to sell the computer you are using in order to afford food, you'll remember how you obnoxiously dismissed the most important information anyone ever told you in your miserable life, which is how one goes about not losing potentially *everything* they own in one fell swoop, in the event of a serious financial crisis.
Edit: I almost forget, I assume you're from the US? If the US Dollar loses its status as world the reserve currency your entire economy will collapse. That's why you went to war with Iraq and Libya, because they wanted to sell oil in a new gold backed currency. But guess what, more powerful countries are trying to take this status from the US dollar now....you can't blow up everyone. You are the type of simpleton the elite in USA relies upon, by the time people like *you* realize whats happening, any crisis will already be in full swing, lol.

Correction just represents the natural market pullback from a swing, if you're looking at an intraday swing the correction will be intraday. If you're looking at a 3 month long swing then the correction will naturally take longer. It's possible to trade even on the monthly chart where runs and correction can take years.
If you do a fib retracement from the start of this bullrun on the btcusd chart, you'll see we are at the 50% correction now, the optimal level for a continuation is around 50-60%. I doubt many will take long positions yet, but I bet many hodler traders will buy back in around now.
Obviously the cause of the correction we understand, but charts and markets still play by the same rules. The areas of resistance remain resistance even with fundamental charting in play.

They're all dropping because they follow Bitcoin and ETH mostly because ICOs are cashing out and they are in a bubble. Far overvalued based on its current intrinsic (useful) value. 
Bitcoin is dropping right now only due to uncertainty with respect to the scaling situation, technically and fundamentally speaking there was absolutely no reason for the daily trend, starting from 888USD and broken at roughly 2446USD to have been broken. The first lower high was directly a result of an announcement from Bitmain, *this* was the reason for the **start** of the downtrend. 
Your assertion in the OP is incorrect from the perspective of any professional trader, but if it helps the average money not to panic, fair enough.

This is draining, I know its more data per block that's exactly what I've been saying. I mean the blocksize when I say blocksize, the capacity of the block and the size of the block are two different things. If I have a car that can fit 100kg of potatoes, I then remove the seats and now I can fit 170kg, is the car bigger? No, the car is the same size. The capacity increased. Segwit is removing the "seats" in the 1mb block.

I personally predicted from 2400usd a fall to 1800/1900USD as we passed it the last time. It *looks* like we will consolidate around this price until a new development. The entire market is waiting for positive news, if this comes (miners actually signal as the have intended) the price could rocket to 3000USD seemingly over night. 
The only reason the money came out from 3000USD is because people are waiting to see the miners actually signal, obviously all the investors are waiting to catch this ride up as well and certainly the miners + associates who will know in advance will put in some insane longs too. 
I think we will see the most explosive gains in Bitcoin *ever* very soon. Obviously it helps that Goldman Sachs wrote exactly this would happen, so we have even the mainstream investors following this space right now all waiting for the **same thing**.

"is an ACTUAL &amp; REAL blocksize limit increase"
No it isn't. Why correct someone when you don't know what you're talking about? Segwit separates the witness data from the block as such increases the capacity of the original block. It doesn't increase the blocksize at all, it just allows more transactions in the same block by removing the witness data. "Segregated witness".
The blocksize right now is 1mb, with Segwit the blocksize remains 1mb.....but this 1mb now carries more transactions.

You have 10btc, each BTC is now worth 1million. You have 20 million USD. If you had sold even 3btc to not be a bag holder you have only 14million in this scenario.
That means, by your logic, not being a bag holder would mean retaining roughly 90% of your holdings which completely contradicts the pretense of your earlier statement.

Well, if you are short, as I suspect, you're going to get liquidated within a few days time. As every new miner signals the price will rise, when it locks in the price will rise, when it activates the price will rise. Say bye to the profits you guessed on the way down.

....but you don't, as stated for the second time now. "With Segregated Witness, the block size limit is no longer measured in bytes." - 


Because it isn't, as stated for the second time now:-
A block has a maximum weight of 4,000,000.
A typical byte in a transaction weighs 4.
A witness byte in a transaction weighs 1.
- 


No, it can't. As stated for the second time now. Because presently you can't change the base blocksize without a HF nor can you change the weight limit without a hardfork:-
"It isn't a block size increase, because increasing the block size would be a hard fork, which segwit isn't."
- 


Obviously they are on a different fork.


No it's not, I did a search for 2 minutes and found everything I've been saying to you is already accepted by the wider community:
**So, TL;DR: it is a blocksize increase if you upgrade to software that understands SegWit, but it isn't if you choose not to upgrade to software that understands SegWit. Funny how that reflects the prevalent opinions among certain Bitcoin user communities. – Murch**
I don't even agree with the above, its a blocksize increase only to those running it if you *change aspects of the definition* to suit the new format. I admit it gets confusing because the transaction format is changed, but the fundamental aspects of what the blocksize currently represents are clear and fundamentally it requires a hardfork. The equivalent now is a Hardfork to double the weight limit *after* Segwit has been activated. That's what the NYA is entirely about doing.

I think Jihan is trying to commandeer Bitcoin to be honest and he will never stop trying (he alluded to this in the past), but he won't sacrifice the whole thing if he can avoid it - this is my opinion.

Haha nice post and very well written. The weed comparison is completely legit as well, it shows that they can do almost anything if they want. But... I might be crazy, but the more I think about it - the fact that its becoming a currency in various countries and getting regulated, goldman sachs thinks it will be going up in price - I think that Bitcoin is *meant* to be successful.
...I also might just be rationalizing so I sleep really well at night, who knows?
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:26:27
Jihan Wu is the guy who came up with the contingency plan to fork off, which then got adopted by others and became BCC. So the last remaining "issue" in the space directly relates to him. Additionally he has the most hashpower in the entire ecosystem, is seen as a "bad actor" in the space and holds in his hands alone the power to stop Segwit activating in the next block period if he chooses to. This is why the market is jumpy right now.

If you don't know more than them, but think that you do, then how could I convince you, when they couldn't.

Kind of, I wrote this to someone the other day:-
To be honest TA isn't meant to be used to predict anything anyway, I only did it on reddit for a laugh.
TA simply allows you to find areas on a chart where there is a lot of market indecision, in these areas you have a lot of amateur traders confused about the price direction. Many think it will go up, many think down. They are all in position and hoping and praying price goes their way.
What we do is find these areas, then when the market decides the "correct" direction we trade the breakout which not only includes new people jumping in on the breakout direction....but also the poor guys jumping out of their losing trade, when they close their position it pushes price in the other direction (if they bought, they sell to get out).
So, there you can see extremely basic logic on how it is possible to trade professionally. TA is just a part of it, but a critical part.

If you think that then you might as well stop trying to do it, because it just makes people with little to no understanding get worried and sell. It has no effect on the price but it just means they sell at the wrong time and have to buy back in higher. It benefits no one. Everyone knows the price is going up from here provided BIP91 gets activated.

I might have added this after you saw it, as an edit:-


If you need a Hardfork to raise the blocksize per the present rules and need a hardfork to raise the blocksize per the new Segwit rules - then how do you "raise the blocksize" just this one time with a Softfork? Why is this a one time exception? It isn't, this time we are just changing the rules of blocksize and a side effect of that is more effective use of space to fit more txs. To adjust the blocksize moving forward, after Segwit's implementation, you must Hardfork.

It isn't that, its just too technical. I follow Bitcoin on an hour by hour basis and I'm a professional trader, but I'm not a developer, so didn't understand the implication of this pull request. I wouldn't have traded it if I did, because I'd assume others would be less technical. The only thing we're waiting for now is the new lock in. Up to that point there is no specific buy in opportunity fundamentally or technically, looking at the chart, because it remains high risk of miners reneging.

So according to you and Luke, Segwit2x is nothing more than a manipulative scheme hoping to prevent BIP148 getting enough support to be able to successfully activate Segwit on August 1. Then just before its time to activate Segwit in 2x it has been agreed one of the miners will pull out preventing it from going through but by that time the support for BIP148 will be such that Segwit cannot activate successfully.
I understand this, but after making such a baseless accusation publicly if Segwit then activates before BIP148 proving these conspiracy theories to be needless paranoia then in my opinion it will look rather stupid. Why? Because it becomes apparent either his perception is totally off and he suffers from a paranoid disposition or his sole aim was to drum up contention in the community in order to garner support for his own solution. Both fit the "stupid" definition for many.
Considering Segwit2x is the agreement the miners agreed to 2 years ago, they have every reason to follow through, hence this accusation is baseless. I can only think of one group that is likely not to want to follow through with all of Segwit2x.

Clearly, I hurt your feelings by not taking you seriously when you *thought* you gave such an "effective" impression you did. But did you really expect a serious response when it is so obvious to an actual trader that you have no idea what you're talking about?
The thing is, the mere fact that **I know** you don't have **any** professional experience **at all** and I say this so definitely should be evidence enough that I actually have. As you sit there and look around, with a moment of clarity:- "But *how* does he know?"....As I said, a trader can spot a faker extremely easily.

I have to admit, I considered that immediately after the post when I remembered what had just happened to the mempool. But, I still hold in mind that even though it was manipulated it still had the same effect because I don't think many of us knew just how severe the spam attacks were.

I went to them to ask why Segwit is harmful and why they oppose it, they didn't provide adequate reasons. I support Segwit for its benefits.
Now I go here and ask why doubling the weight limit is harmful and why they oppose it and they didn't provide adequate reasons, so I support it for its benefits.
On both sides I encountered people who have their beliefs and they don't really know why they hold them, in reality they only hold their views because someone they think knows more than them told them to think it. They trust them. That's it. But I believe in thinking for myself.
Segwit isn't a poison pill and doubling the weight limit of Segwit will not centralize Bitcoin. I'm concluded now and I'm sure anyone else reading this that isn't like the aforementioned people will have too.
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:39:14
I'm really hopeful that we can get this entirely resolved with Segwit2x and have a compromise solution be the one to do it. BIP148 did its job lighting the fire underneath the whole community and Luke-jr knows I was 100% behind BIP148 initially and appreciate the work he was putting in 100% and as such I appreciate the need to keep pushing for it as a safety net. Even if the 2x doesn't need to be done in the end, Segwit2x was the solution that took from both sides - I feel like this is a gesture from both sides that they are ready to work together again. I get frustrated when I detect any efforts to stir. 
Anyway, have a good day!
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:30:01
I think this is directly correlated to the ETH propaganda campaigns that were also everywhere during this same period. It was all to aid the "flippening" in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:54:51
No I'm not new here, I have been following the development on an almost hour by hour basis for years too. Your post just comes across as overly dramatic, as though you're not satisfied with the fact that the scaling debate is coming to a conclusion so you want to find a way to maintain some form of animosity in the community.
To say this sub has become a revolting place and provide the above as basis for the context is incongruous. The position is not justified.
EDIT:- So this doesn't look like a personal attack I will add to it, the POW change is discussed as a reaction to something. BIP148 is to keep the miners signalling. The community isn't decided on the 2x. Essentially there is no basis to any of your complaints as far as I'm concerned.
@_date: 2017-07-24 09:48:54
You just opened a can of worms to so many complaints, although, I personally agree with you.
@_date: 2017-07-05 05:36:11
Can someone seriously tell me how 80-95% of miners signalling Segwit in Segwit2x is *NOT* going to activate Segwit before BIP148?
  
**The NY agreement, that all the major companies and all the major miners agreed to, was designed specifically to prevent a chain split.**
  
So why do we still have people pretending that its all down to hope and luck what happens? It's really winding me up....there will be no chain split to get Segwit. In what parallel universe do the miners decide to ruin the price of Bitcoin, losing themselves money, in order to renege on their *own* agreement?
@_date: 2017-07-03 12:30:22
Please don't go rbtc on me. He is saying Segwit2x is to stall implementation of Segwit. You can't make that statement and not back it up with reason or logic. Segwit2x wants to activate Segwit before BIP148, that doesn't stall Segwit, it speeds it up. 
Literally the only argument for Segwit2x stalling Segwit is a conspiracy theory of "That's what they *say* they want to do but they won't do it" - so what if they do activate it. Then you look stupid for propagating a false conspiracy theory, there's literally no escaping that.
@_date: 2017-07-24 11:40:40
We all know BIP148 won't have any effect provided miners don't renege. So it is a moot point he raises.
However, he acknowledges that his contingency plan concept has been taken forward by others. While he doesn't support it presently he's not saying he will *never* support it, i.e if it magically and against all logic becomes the new Bitcoin (hard to even type something so ridiculous).
Presumably, once Segwit is activated and the price starts going higher and higher BCC (if it goes live, still doubt it) will be considered a nuisance by people like Jihan and other miners. It will be interesting to see if they take any action against that chain.
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:19:54
Around 1800USD is very likely to be where we begin sideways movement again. We're only at 50% correction of the bull run right now, we didn't even reach the typical turnaround point of 60% yet. Technically speaking we aren't even out of bull-mode yet, its just the scaling concerns temporarily halting a huge bull run. People scare too easily, at least, the non-investors do.

Well, we disagree, what can we say more? I think that if Linux was the only option, your average person would not even use computers because it is so impossibly difficult to use.
This is coming from someone *in* the Bitcoin space, I used to use a cold wallet of elecrum on a fresh install of Linux and I had to install python-pip every-time I wanted to install Electrum.
The code on the electrum website didn't work so I literally had to spend an hour+ trawling the internet trying to find this magic code that would actually install something that would then allow me to install something else that would then allow me to install electrum. There was no guide for this, I literally guessed my way to do this over hours the first time. Then I took a photo of the 3 step process for next time, the photo got deleted. I had to spend hours the next time in the same way because I forgot what I did.
I absolutely cursed the day that I decided to set up a cold wallet in this way and could not understand how Linux was even a thing while Windows existed (thank you Trezor).
So, as aforementioned, in my opinion computers are only a thing today because of Microsoft made it easy to use and that is therefore their USP. You might think I'm an idiot, but the fact I know how to run a node means I'm even more "technical" than the average Bitcoin user, who is far more technical than the average person :-).

A Blocksize increase would be a Hardfork and it would apply to everyone. It's only a blocksize increase if you bend the definition and make the assumption that everyone decides to run it... and you can't make that assumption.
Also, even for the people that decide to run it, it isn't a blocksize increase in the traditional sense because a 2x blocksize in the conventional sense would just mean doubling the blocksize. In Segwit they don't double the blocksize, they just create more room in the *same* 1mb block by removing the Witness data. That is why we refer to the effective blocksize increase, just like you did.
You would not differentiate between the blocksize and the "effective" blocksize if there was no difference. So there was a contradiction, a blindingly obvious and frankly comical one given what you were trying to argue, that there is NO difference.
Is Segwit a blocksize increase in the traditional sense then? Are we doubling the blocksize to 2mb? Or are we expanding the capacity of the same size block? The mental gymnastics here will be fun to read because now you're forced to agree with me, or just lie.

...and then dump them all into the market at the highest (fastest) possible price. Which sends a message to other exchanges that it's not going to be a viable coin permitting them to also not support it and simply join the dumping race. 
Which further sends a message to those supporting it not to bother buying any, which prevents the price from rising at all. Which means that Viabtc will be he only ones actually *in* the coin with money to lose, which therefore puts them off releasing it in the first place averting the entire issue. Tadaa, *takes a bow*.

I do have high hopes, all this talk of honoring agreements from those miners the last couple of years...they would lose face to an extreme if they renege on the deal. In China it is absolutely the worst thing in society to lose face. Segwit2x could literally be them conceding in the only way they worked out to be able to without appearing to lose face.
I have a feeling Segwit will activate as planned then they will push a little for the HF, let it all fizzle out and then say "look we keep our agreements and they don't".

Thanks for the information. Though this just stops people being confused over the fact Segwit uses the new Weight limit parameter instead of kb to measure the blocksize. The base blocksize is still used to calculate the weight limit:-
"Its correct value is not independently settable but is a function
 of the weight limit and weight formula."
Segwit is changing what blocksize actually means. One just has to ask this question, how would you raise the blocksize, per the context of Segwit's new rules, once Segwit has been implemented? With a Hardfork to raise the weight limit.
If you need a Hardfork to raise the blocksize per the *present* rules and need a hardfork to raise the blocksize per the *new* Segwit rules - then how do you "raise the blocksize" just this one time with a Softfork? Why is this a one time exception? It isn't, this time we are just changing the rules of blocksize and a side effect of that is more effective use of space to fit more txs. To adjust the blocksize moving forward, after Segwit's implementation, you must Hardfork.

In my opinion the fact BIP148 is so "out there" in the way you clearly appreciate sends a very strong method to those trying to prevent these upgrades. The only thing it assumes is the miners want Bitcoin to be a high price.
@_date: 2017-05-16 09:34:05
Its all because they want Segwit as a Hard fork and not as a Softfork.....I tried to get to the bottom of why this from the horses mouth in rBTC and literally no one can provide a real reason.
They just start saying that its people some people don't trust blockstream, which is the answer you get for literally any question in that Sub.
What we need to do is make sure that there are regular posts about UASF activation in here so that it is a success.

Yeah, **SCUM** USA. Going round the world stealing from or murdering innocent people like usual.
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:01:36
Hmmmm. OP - if USA stages a terrorist attack in USA and kills a 1000 people then proves through the blockchain that it was entirely financed through Bitcoin, then shows 2 other recent cases where something terrible was financed through Bitcoin they could literally look up the mining pools from each Country and threaten sanctions on the Government of each one to have them shut down.
Each government would comply. But we'd start to change the POW.....except all the major developers use their real names. So if USA arrested all of them and put out extradition notices for all the other main guys who would then do it?
In between all of that almost everyone would have cashed out that could and the price would be next to nothing. Then they could sanction all countries running public exchanges. All banks could cut Bitcoin businesses off.
People need to realize, the governments around the world are trying to create a cashless society. Digital money like Bitcoin fits in perfectly with this goal. Just because its pseudo anonymous right now and decentralized does not mean that they won't swoop in and change it later on once everyone is already dependent - people already suspect there are attempts to do this. For all we know the attempts thus far simply come from well financed individuals like Roger ver and Jihan and the Governments haven't even begun their takeover yet. But it is certain that we won't know when they start if they don't want us to.
I think we need to face a little dose of reality, USA can easily and completely fuck Bitcoin as we know it today and immediately, if they chose to. 
Yes we could move to a new coin, but the price would be starting again from 0 and there could be no Western exchanges supporting it then when it become truly global and stable the same thing would probably happen.
There is only a few, I mean very, very few things that US Government can not control....and then they find a way to literally murder and blow up everyone involved with it. The ONLY thing this does not apply to is where Russia or China are prepared to go to war and that won't happen for Crypto. Therefore, you can probably assume this whole thing is happening exactly per the plan.

I think we might be talking on cross purposes a little bit, I don't support BU, I support Segwit and I know how Segwit works and what it does. My original request was for anyone to put forward an explanation of how doubling the weight-limit of Segwit will centralize the network.


Based on this you too can not see the harm in it. Some people, including Nullc are not only saying it is *potentially* hardful but are saying it will destroy Bitcoin. As I've said, I have no found anything that corroborates this (btw this terminology will no longer apply once segwit is active, we will only be hardforking to increase the weight limit of Segwit)


No, I don't. Do you think the full nodes are run mostly by people on a Pi? Do we have statistics on this? Without knowing the percentage of people running a full node using Pi's arguing entire protocol changes using "what about Pis" as an argument sounds even more ridiculous to me. So I assume you have some pretty accurate stats on this?

Looking at the chart it could be entering side-ways consolidation already. But honestly the Bitcoin chart after a crash is a phychological game, not entirely a technical one. You have to wait and see till the last moment. Really, you have to analyze the chart and then think, at what point will the guys who were part of the crash get scared they'll miss the next move up? If some big whale decides the crash is finished and buys back in and the price goes to 2200USD in a couple of minutes (on 'finex right now that's only a couple thousand btc), why wouldn't others follow? So we're waiting on maybe one or two big guys, this isn't certain...nor is it impossible.

@_date: 2017-07-05 11:18:57


This is something I've been saying for a while in support of Cores road map, I understand this is the ideal way to move forward. But I don't see how having a hardfork to double the weight limit of Segwit breaks Bitcoin by causing centralization. This is what doesn't make any sense to me and even having spoken with nullc about it don't have a believable reason for this.


Provided these countries compete with each other in some form or another and one doesn't get full control over Bitcoin what the individual governments want to do is completely irrelevant once we have decentralized market places. At that point even if governments were only hosting nodes USA would have to take over Russia and China to force a protocol change just through node use.


What makes you think I live in a first world Country? Because I don't. I don't and I can't run a full node as it is. This is why I find it so funny when people are talking on behalf of people like myself and constantly getting it wrong. 
If I want to run a Pi I have to import it from another Country and pay 50% tax on it, then the internet won't even cope unless I want to *only* run a node with my family's internet.
The only people running Pis are rich nerds generally in first world countries that can afford a decent computer anyway and I guarantee no individual in my Country is running a Pi. The ones who can afford it are busy driving around in flash cars tending to their hotels and casinos + the internet can't cope and the ones that can't afford it don't even know what a Bitcoin is because they don't have an internet connection in their house and only use 3g on their mobile for Facebook and twitter. 
...and here's the major crux, the minimum wage is more than 2USD a day and people use *only* cash for *everything*. So rbtc's banking the unbanked dream is a joke too for third world countries that maintain cash societies (all of them)...but no one listens to that when I say it there either, lol.

If I was one of the other admins, I'd let the site stay down and let people assume it was taken down by the cops, IF I was not concerned about the reputation. Someone is still concerned about its reputation. The server came back online, with the maintenance page, this doesn't happen by accident.
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:42:25
Looking at the chart we are in a consolidation period, an up-trend of 4 months vs a down-trend of under a single month - so technically speaking one would expect price to break out upwards within the next 4 days to hit a price of around 2700USD some time afterwards.
However, while you can lean towards a guess at a likely outcome it isn't possible to predict this current scenario because the sentiment is quite mixed right now. A lot of anxiety and anticipation with respect to July 29th. If we get some good news regarding Segwit2x/Segwit in general in the next few days you can assume a positive breakout will occur. If there is some bad news then a break down becomes more possible, but its more likely just to move sideways if this occurs. 
It is also possible traders will take a back-seat and just consolidate sideways through both trends because of the uncertainty.
So to sum it up, its likely to go up, will go up with good news, it could go sideways for a bit longer just because, it needs bad news to go down.

Banks are criminal in the West. But the Indian Government is more criminal than the western banks. So it seems strange to be thankful haling from a Country that recently set out a policy to steal gold from the population if they own "too much". Let alone the fact they recently discontinued the top value notes with a few days notice so people lost their entire savings if they couldn't get to the bank in time.
India is literally a testing ground for *the most* Orwellian financial practices that the West could ever hope to get away with implementing (I understand the CIA had a big influence). The most shocking thing is how they've absolutely done a number on the population who are actually happy with their government (like yourself) openly stealing from them because at least it makes it a little bit harder for the "criminals" and their "black money".

I think if Jihan wanted to, with CSW's plans in mind, he could at least do the same.

What proof? How about, you've never made a BTC prediction before and every one I've ever made publicly on reddit over the past 6 months has been correct and I've never deleted one before? Like the break of the 1200USD ATH, a 100USD move 5hrs in advance, the swing from 940USD to over 1000USD, the swing from 700USD to 840USD correct to within an hour - all many hours in advance. I've had people reaching out to me via PM literally telling me they've been actively following my predictions since the first one and they are shocked that I'm right every-time and there are people in one of those threads saying I must be a multi-millionaire or billionare for being able to do this.
Is this where you accept what I've been saying or you continue your delusion? My OP in this sequence is correct, I know it is and I don't appreciate a non trader pretending they have an edge over me. So give it up.

The real Satoshi wouldn't need a contingency plan associated with his real identity because he specializes in Cryptography and can easily hide his real identity. Otherwise the CIA or FBI would have found out who Satoshi was long before Craig Wright said it was him and they would have smeared him into oblivion.

Looking at this chart it is pretty obvious what is going on. Miners are doing this to push up the price of the TXs and it costs them less money to do this than the increased profit they get for doing it.....this is an active business choice, so it will never stop until new protocol upgrades prevent it from being profitable.

This is extremely interesting and makes perfect sense. The banks want to follow the KYC/AML because they HAVE to or face fines, but really all they want to do is make more money. Historically banks had no problem handling *anyone's* money - until the Govt stepped in.
It appears from what you're saying, they *themselves* are trying to find a way to get out of this regulatory pressure and see Bitcoin as the ideal way to do this in a covert way.

@_date: 2017-07-17 20:54:16
Yes, I'm quite confident to be honest. Much of the money that left Bitcoin for altcoins was purely because the fees went too high for certain use cases and out of frustration for the scaling debate. Much of that money will come back almost immediately upon conclusion of the scaling debate (at this stage anyway). I also think the 3000USD level was artificially capped by the absolutely horrendous situation within the entire crypto community attacking each other and then by the announcement from Bitmain regarding his contingency plan (this was the start of the down trend) and also by the fact BIP148 was going to cause a chain split - that run should have continued far past 3000USD.
All the money that sold from that point did so specifically to cash in before the inevitable and obvious correction that would occur as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the scaling debate. Those that left understanding *why* they were leaving will enter again once Segwit2x activates which will be taking the price back to 3000USD very very quickly, *then* those that left Bitcoin for alts for fundamental purposes (lack of use cases, P2P cash vision blurred, slow confirmation times, high fees) will filter back in and those looking for the new Bitcoin in various alts as an investment will rejoin Bitcoin for the bullrun. In addition to these facts as there will be new use cases enabled again there will be organic adoption, then lots of bullish news regarding Lightning network, mimble wimble etc.....on top of all of that any intelligent institutional investors that have been following this space that know all of this will buy in too. This correction we just experienced was very likely the best buying in opportunity that we'll ever see.
I think 5k within 3 years is extremely conservative, if everything above goes to plan we will see 5k before the end of the year.

Almost the entire community has been complaining of him being a little out of touch with respect to the capacity the network requires to function right now. Some are claiming we need 8mb right now to function properly. Most of us assumed 2mb was needed pretty urgently just to function, but Luke has been saying that 1mb is absolutely fine for now and implementing Segwit is more than sufficient on its own for for the immediate future.
The sudden drop in the mempool as we come to an agreement indicates that there has been intentional bloating, we all knew this was the case anyway, but I don't think any of us (many?) knew it was to this extent.
So credit where credit is due, u/luke-jr was right all along on this. Good on him.

Why do we get unqualified people with zero investment in Bitcoin thinking they are some kind of authority? The sole issue we *actually* have in Bitcoin is loads of people like OP.
The Bitcoin network is only anything because, right now, people have spent their hard earned money investing in mining equipment (and in businesses and in the asset itself) but to call punish the people who took a risk investing directly in Bitcoin in this way is just disgusting behavior.
There is nothing wrong with the system as it is, if you don't like that someone has too much hash rate set up your own farm. For a couple hundred million you can rival Jihan.
The only reason why people aren't already doing this is because  of people like OP calling for POW change. Why should someone invest even a penny in mining equipment when they are idiots like OP trying to drum up support for a POW change and risk losing their entire investment?
People like OP are the ones trying to destroy Bitcoin by destroying the investment into its security.

Then I find you accusing me of being a sock-puppet when 2 minutes of research proves its not the case.
You:- "There is no social consensus involved in Bitcoin protocols"

You:- "Because people are easily led"
Me:- "Why does that matter if there's no social consensus?"
You:- "I don't speak derp"

260USD to send 2k? That's terrible in comparison to 2USD for 2k.
Also, just because your Country has that service doesn't mean others do. The *only* method for large transactions is in store and most countries the service only works in store. As aforementioned in my country the standard wait time is like 20-30 minutes for these guys to even get seen then 20 minutes to process the send OR receive on top of that....just to see the transaction was frozen or a name miss-spelled. Then it has to be done on the other side. My friend is China says the standard queue time in the inner city Chinese banks is like 60 minutes so for them its even worse to find out the person gave a single letter or number wrong on the exchanged details.

There are many reasons why they don't do this. Probably the most blindingly obvious reason is the millions upon millions of dollars of investment in Bitcoin being a success (the higher the price the higher the return) and having a substantial income for the rest of their lives.

What you're saying might make sense to you or maybe I (even though I'm opposed) but to the general population it just sounds like "Bitcoin got hacked by miners and doesn't work anymore". This is a worse look than Jihan having too much hashpower - which means nothing to the general pop and that can *still* be resolved. New companies need to develop ASICS, that should not be so hard.
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:43:56
I'm extremely surprised to see this is from a moderator.


In the same way I can nearly guarantee the human race will one day be wiped out. If Bitcoin lasts for the next 200 years, this will inevitably be the case. 


This is totally redundant advice for *too many people* - when people set up a business do you think they have this in mind? When they take out loans from the bank before they even know if it will be a success, which is common practice? Well, what about the businesses investing in Bitcoin? The ones that need Bitcoin to be a success for them to be able to pay off *their* loans. What about the miners who spent 2,000,000USD on mining equipment and don't even see a return for 2 years, do you think they can lose their investment? This isn't a year old tech with no industry, this is approaching 10 years deep with many many thousands of people needing Bitcoin to be a success for their entire livelihood. 
There are many, many, many people who have invested more than they can afford to lose in Bitcoin because they see the years long up trend and believe in it. Half the eco-system has invested more than they can afford to lose and many users have too. You only lose when you cash out, because if you believe in Bitcoin long term you *don't* cash out because the idea is that it will increase in price as it becomes adopted. 
For someone to say "more than you can afford to lose" implies Bitcoin can easily still go to 0 and never recover and if you believe that then you cannot *pretend* to believe in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a huge part of my life and I believe in it 100%, people can invest any amount in it that they want and *they do* everyday because of logic. Because it *IS* growing in popularity, the scaling issues *are* getting resolved so the price **should** continue to rise. 
If you start talking about probabilities, what is the probability of Bitcoin crashing and dying vs what is the probability your bank forecloses, or you get sued, or you do something wrong and the government seizes your assets or the economy crashes and you get hit with hyper-inflation or there is a war in your country or your country goes to war or your country gets sanctioned for some reason - this all depends on which Country your from or what industry you are in. For many people Bitcoin is an escape from fiat because they are *more likely* to lose in fiat than in Bitcoin, so again, warning people with a blanket statement "don't invest more than you can lose" - really, it means nothing and makes no sense. Someone with 500,000USD worth of gold in India that heard gold was going to be made semi-illegal could have come to the forum seen this statement and decided not to put it all in Bitcoin...then their gold was confiscated and Bitcoin doubled in price. Same for people in Venezuela, same for people about to be sued, same for any number of situations that exist all around the World and affect millions of people.


Get you to sell. If I'd bought BTC at $3000, I would probably be disinclined to sell at this local minimum.
Prevent you from buying. If you're looking to buy, a local minimum like the one existing now is often a good time to think about doing so.
You're interested in a Helicopter are you? Well, if you use a private Helicopter, you have an 40% chance of dying in it. I'm just saying, you should be prepared to die in your Helicopter if you buy it or at least your family shouldn't be surprised if you die in it. I can almost guarantee if you drive your Helicopter enough at some point you *will* crash it. I'm not trying to put you off getting the Helicopter, its just general unsolicited safety advice.
I think I understand what this post is *trying* to do, the only context it makes any sense at all is to help people understand that there are fluctuations in the price and that they should be aware of this. *Everyone already knows this*, it doesn't and never will stop panic when the price drops.
I have plenty on the line and I'm not bothered when the price drops because I'm used to it - not because I can afford to lose it and that's consistent for **every** holder.

Wow, I read the second half of it, through the entire escapade of his "reveal" and I have firmly made my conclusion.
His entire aim was to sell the patents, he openly stated this intention but it was propositioned as a side point to the reveal. No, this was the entire point.
*The entire thing was meticulously planned from start to finish and executed exactly as planned through the entire process.* He knew the first people he showed the signing to would not know off the top of their head that the private key he would use was publicly accessible. He therefore knew that in the confines of his house he could successfully convince anyone, *before* the "proof" went online. He knew very well that if he could convince a figure head that had a lot of credibility and many advocates - that would then go public with the information - that the figure head's opinion alone would provide a valid rebuttal against anyone trying to say the proof was fake, initially. This would bide him a little bit of time for phase 2.
The phase 2 was to present an effective dilemma that meant he could *reasonably* back out from providing the real proof.
The dilemma is that he must choose between potentially being labelled as a terrorist and imprisoned in the UK, not being able to see his family OR appearing to be forced to look like a fraud to the crypto-community.
This is a particularly effective dilemma because firstly it occurs *after* having convinced figure heads he was Satoshi meaning his reveal would likely forever be published online, with all their credentials to corroborate it.
But also because it paints himself as being in a horrendously unfair position and ultimately behaving in an endearing and honorable way by sacrificing his reputation in order to protect his family.
The context of his being initially "outed" and publicly extremely "reluctant" to be doing any of it provides further "evidence" of this being a *genuine* dilemma that he will "find" himself in.
However, to believe the narrative of this sequence of events there is one *key* assumption. One very, very key assumption. That the inventor who was privacy/legally aware enough to hide their identity in the first place, and to disappear once the CIA were contacted indicating they were aware of the legal implications *before* Bitcoin was used to fund the dark web was now *no longer aware of the legal implications*.
That is, Craig Wright who apparently hid his identity, disappeared from the face of the earth once the CIA merely heard about Bitcoin and before Bitcoin was used for illegal purposes, with all his obvious intelligence, his many degrees, his masters and PHD, knowledge of banks not working with Bitcoin and his access to entire legal teams.....was *not aware that proving he was the inventor would potentially lead to legal issues.*
No that is absurd by anyone's standard. In reality he was well aware, but this "surprise revelation" that he would be potentially prosecuted was to be used as leverage to reasonable construct the situation that he now finds himself in. A small portion of people believe him based solely on the fact he had Gavin convinced at one point and now he is a someone in the crypto-space ready to prepare all his patents with the most brilliant sales pitch possible - as the "possible" **inventor** of Bitcoin. Craig Wright, is what is known out of the business world, as a sociopath.

Cognitive dissonance is the uncomfortable *feeling* you get when you realize a deeply held belief is incorrect, as I've come to no realization you just look like yet another pseudo-intellect that likes to use words they don't fully understand.


Interested in understanding what? That you think I'm incapable of "deep thought" because I recognize Bitcoin isn't an experiment in any sense of the definition of that word? While you can't string a sentence together that even makes sense in the English language?

He says the contingency plan is only if Segwit2x *doesn't* activate and that he plans even to implement Segwit (without the discount) within his new chain even if BIP148 works.


I've been involved for a number of years so I'm well aware of this and this fact is the basis of my support for the Core developers, like yourself, in the first place. 
But at a fork in the road where the options appear to have catastrophic failures down all the roads but one, the correct pathway becomes very clear. If those I trust are not taking this pathway my immediate question becomes, why? It is a complete resolution almost immediately to the issues we face.
Given what the other options are right now: BIP148 chain split and Bitmain coin or months of more arguing while people continue to endlessly FUD Bitcoin to get people to leave (working) as fees rise and companies leave while hoping BIP191 works (which it might not) and then still having immediate capacity problems even if it does work.
It is so blindingly obvious what our time should be spent doing and that's ensuring Segwit2x is successful. The only people I imagined that would be against it are the ETH pumpers trying to stall Bitcoin to get more of a foothold. Sincerely, I could never imagine Core developers would also be against such a reasonable compromise. 
I'm not trying to imply anything, or have a go at you personally, I'm more just appealing to you as a figure head to try to get it to work and encourage others to do the same.

I'm trying to patiently and respectfully explain to you why we've hit a brick wall in this dispute. The reason is because this isn't just a technical issue anymore, it is also a social issue and that because there are so many people that *lack social skills* in this space they lack the ability to reach a social consensus. I then sarcastically thanked you for being just one more of the socially inept unable to recognize a social issue from a technical one, so to prove me wrong you ignored all the references to the social aspect of this dispute and started quoting from wikipedia and the white-paper.

@_date: 2017-06-15 09:00:18
Segwit2x is not about stalling, it's about compromise that brings the community together by giving what everyone wants and what Bitcoin actually needs. If it is also compatible with BIP148 then that is absolutely excellent.

I think this is not necessarily true. I think Bitcoin has the ability to financially oppress people in ways we couldn't possibly comprehend if protocol changes were able to be enacted by Governments.

Lol, I don't mean to be 'counter discussion'. I just really really dislike it when people suggest destroying other people's investments for no real reason. Not only that but the mere suggestion of it puts off others who are interested in investing and its those new people investing that will resolve this issue.....so it is so counter productive. 
To elaborate, I considered starting a mining farm, the investment would have been huge, but since the first person said 'change the pow' it has been totally off the table for me.
Only will I reconsider if there is an official statement from Core saying they will never endorse it. Now, imagine if I was planning on investing 500M USD with Bitfury.....the whole issue of Bitmain having too much hashower would vanish just from that. I'd have taken 20 percent right off the bat. Then ask how many other people are in a similar dilemma.

AML and KYC is just a lip service that cannot be avoided if you want mainstream use in prison countries like USA/UK/EU.
The only way to get governments to help it is the say "Please regulate us, we love government and regulation". All the while the entire thing by design overthrows their own financial system and they're too stupid to realize because they get tax - so you should thank people like Jeff for misleading them into thinking it can be regulated at all. To be honest its people like yourself that want Bitcoin to have a bad reputation that is much worse for its adoption and price.

This response is just mind numbingly stupid. Do you not even realize that this dispute and the context of "consensus" in resolving this dispute is that of a social nature?
Do you not realize that what we have different groups of *people* that are disagreeing with each other causing this issue?
Do you not understand that these groups of *people* need to agree for there to be a successful outcome? That these different groups of *people* need to reach consensus on the desired protocol, taking into consideration all those with significant roles (developers, miners, users, businesses), for it to be successful in its implementation?
This dispute is a result of the biggest collection of people with no social skills trying to govern something important themselves. Thanks, by the way for being one more person in the mix without the ability to discern a social issue from a purely technical one.

How can you make an assumption on my sincerity? The reasons I've seen *do* appear trivial. One was from a Twitter post within the character limit: "They didn't take our advice" - what advice? Where's the dialogue? 
The most extensive one I've seen, which I read earlier today was from Greg, Nullc, and his complaints it that are literally that it is rushed and doesn't follow the normal procedure. As if BIP148 isn't rushed and does follow normal procedure, yet some Core developers support that...
If you have more in depth information on why they reject it then I'd absolutely **love** to see it because right now it is disconcerting that they've rejected it before even seeing the code - which implies it's been rejected on principle alone. Rejected on *what* principle exactly? Please explain this for me.

Honestly, I've heard people claiming the exact opposite.


Honestly, I've heard people say this very thing about Segwit.
At this point it should be clear to both "sides" that there is truth in both sides of the debate and that the only fair solution is a compromise. That is what we now have. As someone who has actually argued for *both* sides I'm absolutely ecstatic that the result keeps 90% of people happy rather than only 40-50%. Everyone *should* be, too.

"Regulations are the old way of doing things" - no they aren't. We live in increasingly regulatory times. If you think the ICO bubble will pop without it being used to instigate government regulation you are deluded.
There's no government body who's sole job is to regulate cryptocurrency, but there has been attempts to stifle its growth and regulation implemented. The SECs job is literally to stop things like ICOs existing.

So in your mind every-time someone has "too much" hashrate they need to go? That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard with respect to mining. Why not just increase the hashrate of other pools and have the network *more* decentralized and *more* secure and not *more* decentralized but *less* secure.
A single investment of 500m will create another pool the same size as Bitmains, Bill Gates could create a pool that would take over 90% of the hashrate next month. The principle of mining is that rich people around the world **compete** for hashrate.
If USA/China/India/Russia all decided to set up government funded mining pools in anticipation of Bitcoin becoming a global currency Bitmain would barely be visible on the chart. I'm fed up with people with zero understanding chiming in about how things should be run.

I thought I had spelled it out for your the last time, but no, the extent of your "limitations" (Mild Autism?) are more prevalent than I could have ever imagined. To be perfectly honest, I was already feeling a little guilty over how brutal the previous response was. I don't know if I have it in me to continue to embarrass you so relentlessly, even in spite of how annoying it is that you don't know how to just accept that you made an ass out of yourself.
Let me help you:-


the capacity to have an effect on the character, development, or behaviour of someone or something, or the effect itself.
Now we have cleared up what influence means maybe this will help you? When I said "influence" I meant the actual definition of the word, that is usually how this thing called "language" works. We use words and those words have set meanings, you don't get to just imagine the rest - "or he will fire them". That isn't normal.


Well done, you used "influence" in a sentence and expressed someone's ability to change someones mind by "arguing his case". Now we can move on to the next elementary school level lesson, which is the principle of "figures of authority" and how views and opinions carry more weight if expressed by someone who is in *a position of authority*. Adam Back is the CEO of the company, so he has an extra special ability to potentially "influence" (that word again!) those in the company and the fact he is an authority figure can act as leverage in the "influencing effect" his opinion would have had *anyway*.
If you'd like to learn more about how authority figures can influence people more easily than others (I imagine you are struggling greatly with this principle), please see the psychological study below titled "Can an authority figures influence human behavior?". Hint: The answer is "Yes". 
- 


Another big well done for your finally understanding the concept of people having the ability to change their opinions on things! You see, you perfectly demonstrated this ability with this very statement *all by yourself*, because up to this point you argued it wasn't possible! However, it is a little bitter sweet because you go on to say:-


I can only assume this inability of yours to follow such a basic train of thought is down to your "special limitations", because my "train of thought" consisted of two isolated and factually indisputable statements. One of which you just agreed to.


It's pretty safe to say, you bit off far more than you can chew this time. I actually feel a little bit guilty, like I'm going to get bad karma, for crushing someones pseudo-intellectual internet persona so completely. 
If you even have the confidence to respond to this I'll at least have to give you credit for something, such an impressive level of persistence, kind of like watching someone electrocute themselves over and over again.

I'm surprised this hasn't been discussed before, really an impressive observation.

No not at all, my question was exactly this: "At what point do investors realize it isn't going to happen?"
I've just been told by someone else in response 5-10 years(!!) before we have any successful company running off of ETH, why so long? It's been functional all this time, can you tell me why it will take so long? 
As I said, for how Bitcoin would change the world was known and functional instantly. Decentralized personal banking, border-less payments, store of value like gold that cannot be confiscated and transferred anywhere. Its niche was known instantly and it was used for it instantly. ETH has no niche after 2 years and I'm not seeing any concrete ideas on where its specialty will lie. I'm not being ignorant or malicious, these are just factual observations that represent my concerns of investing in this tech *right now*.
@_date: 2017-06-23 07:06:17


I didn't entirely:-


But I maintain that it is pretty much a sure thing that *if* Segwit2x gets implemented that we will see 5000USD this year. So if someone is wondering if now is a good time to invest then the answer is 100% unequivocally YES -
 there hasn't ever been a better time to invest in Bitcoin than now as a result.

I think its actually misleading. The real explanation this is getting at is Hardforks are not backwards compatible but Softforks are, I assume. Only, with UASF they aren't backwards compatible because the legacy chain reorganizes. So the analogy doesn't really make any sense in my opinion.

@_date: 2017-06-18 18:31:27
If the fees won't push people to act out why do we have BIP148 that was proposed 2 months ago as a viable option that could split the chain? Why do we even have Segwit2x that has 3 months in total to be enacted? Why do we have people even compromising at all? Why do we have people leaving Bitcoin *for* altcoins since the blocks went full? 
This is *all* because of fees. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 09:11:15
What if ten million people have 50c worth each? Will they all get taken to court to do what you're implying?
Because you could put them in an exchange, pull them out, put them in and pull them out and you just achieved the above in less than a day - as long as that exchange can't give the details of your account its secure.
So you can imagine you could put in them in an exchange in one country, convert them to Ripple, send to another exchange in another country and convert them to ETH then to another exchange in another country and convert them to BTC, then gamble with them in a Bitcoin casino in another country then convert them to monero and then cash them out.

I don't know why you are making this personal, the fact that this is the top post in rbtc and almost the top post in rbitcoin proves quite conclusively that this **is** a community issue. We respect him highly and care what he thinks. People want clarification on his stance. It is in *his* interest to do that too if he has misrepresented himself unintentionally. As I stated in my last sentence:-




Sorry, but yes it does. Because Bitcoin represents what people want, if no one wants Bitcoin anymore Bitcoin goes away. Ergo, the community determines what the fees should ideally be and the community rejects 20+USD fees. If you aren't happy with that, it isn't my fault, take it up with the collective community. I'm really not interested in arguing the toss, he stated it publicly and he has the opportunity to defend it publicly, it was already the top post in rbtc when I found it. I'm pretty sure he appreciates getting the opportunity to clarify his stance because people *are* interested.

Yes, that's why the consensus for BIP148 isn't being entirely driven though social media. Yet another good observation. I guess, because BIP148 is entirely driven through social consensus, it is impossible for it to have any effect on Bitcoin because there's no such thing in Bitcoin, right? lol.

Very informative points and well articulated too. It is important this becomes common knowledge because I'm still arguing with trolls about some of the most basic aspects of the UASF and they seem incapable of following along. 
For example this genius, u/manWhoHasNoName, who thinks the core concept of a UASF is impossible and believes that miners will just continue to mine the minority chain at a loss in order to maintain a chain split indefinitely and that they will always have a choice not to switch over support even if mining for a *loss*.
Even the rbtc trolls understand this concept:-

"He obviously expects feedback on the numbers, being a reasonable and interactive man."
This is feedback in that case, using figures like this does nothing but frighten the life out of normal bitcoin users. It gives ammunition to conspiracy theories circulating too. It is not
It is very reasonable for us on rbitcoin to ask for clarification on this stance outside of what we hope he means. Because it is already being used on rbtc as a 'from the horses mouth' evidence of how "blockstream" wants to cripple Bitcoin so clarification is beneficial. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 10:14:18
But that could not be possible unless almost all Bitcoins were stolen i.e if you swap all your stolen Bitcoin back into the ecosystem and somehow get a load more stolen Bitcoins then almost all Bitcoins have been stolen at some point. I don't know if I'm explaining this concept clearly. If you dip your hand into a pit of 10 million balls and pull out 1000 balls and 900/1000 balls are yellow then 90% of the balls are going to be yellow...everyone pulling out balls will be getting yellow balls.

Feel free to check through our post histories if you really think it wasn't an accident, I just checked his post history and he has posts in a "Munich" sub....I've never been there, no references to there in my post history and have never posted in that sub. Same for his "Blackhat" sub posts, I'm not a hacker and have never alluded to that a single time in my post history. He's posted in "fortinet" and I don't know what that even is. He posts smilies like ";-)" and ":D" and I have never used either of those in my entire post history. 
Probably the biggest give away is that he also writes in German and I have never once done that in my 7 month post history, because I don't know German.
I hope you don't have some hard feelings about my embarrassing your logic yesterday with respect to your assertion that there is zero social component in the determination of the scaling pathway for Bitcoin.... and that is your motivation for finding and for posting this in spite of it being overwhelmingly obvious we aren't the same person from a 5 minute check into our post history.

It is.


No offence, but everyone that matters will. The double weight limit will be a huge, huge bonus to Bitcoin in terms of transaction fees and speed of the network.
The only way this doesn't happen is if a giant lightning network suddenly appears within 3 months of the Segwit activation and people decide the HF is not and will not ever be needed. But lets face it, it is impossible for an entire industry to magically appear in less than 3 months from nothing.

He supported Segwit in the HK agreement 2 years ago.  He has been prepared to implement Segwit for the past 2 years provided the HF was included. He is supporting the immediate activation of Segwit2x, which (erm, I'm guessing you need this explained) contains Segwit as well. He also planned to implement Segwit if he forked off onto his own coin... saying he doesn't want Segwit kind of looks ridiculous to anyone that knows this information. You can't even argue that he is just willing to "compromise" on the basis of getting what he wants, because as aforementioned he even wants it in his Jihancoin HF.
Edit: You're meant to down-vote if someone doesn't contribute to the discussion or provides incorrect information, this information **is** correct. Down-voting this is just because it doesn't suit a particular narrative. I don't even like the guy, I'm just telling the truth.
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:13:40
All of this only if Segwit2x doesn't activate, and he supports its activation. BIP148 wants Segwit, Segwit is also in the compromise....why don't the people supporting this support Segwit2x? Because they don't want the HF? That's not how compromise works....not accepting compromise when offered in favor of forcing people to do what you want? That's not cool.
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:10:22
Why don't I know about this poll and I live here in r/bitcoin? I think its more like 80-90% pro Segwit. Having said that I'm pro-bigger blocks too where needed. I'm particularly impressed with the BU developer's statement, he took an admirable stance on the subject in the name of progress. Big thumbs up to him.
@_date: 2017-06-15 09:21:39
If BIP148 becomes compatible with Segwit2x then he has no reason to Hardfork to prevent replay protection. But as it stands that is literally the only way. I saw someone said this to LukeDashjr and he had literally no response:-
"If BIP148 splits with 10% HR and no one follows assuming failure, then a month passes and there's a reorg and everyone loses money, its ok?" 
If they become compatible he can actually signal support for BIP148 and then do Segwit2x afterwards. We don't need to FUD up the space anymore than it has been.

If its launched and its such a resounding success that no one has pulled them on this yet then I can only assume there isn't that many users on it.


My statement which is dispute is whether or not there are "real uses" for it yet. With your examples, that are barely being used, you have proved my point very adequately. 
We aren't talking about Bitcoin, you called me stupid because I said Ethereum has not real uses yet, then went on to prove me correct. I think Bitcoin is in a dire situation right now and it saddens me that the next best alternative is an over-hyped centralized mess of which its primary use is to circumvent the SECs security regulations.

Thanks for the link, I read it all carefully and I fully appreciate the points. I still think it is the best option and most likely to actually scale Bitcoin, it just represents higher risk from the fact that it is rushed. Just like the higher risk of BIP148, like the high risk of Bitmain coin, like high risk of no scaling or layer 2's, like the high risk of waiting months and BIP149 not working - it is all high risk now.

During the restriction there was selling pressure because people were worried Bitcoin could get banned and they all sold for CNY....the price went down. No one was trapped in Bitcoin, they left if they weren't happy with the risk. Now the situation has normalized those people buy back in creating a buying pressure, the price is going up. 
There is ZERO selling pressure from this situation. The people who bought *during* the restriction were doing so on the pretense that when things normalize the price will go *up* afterwards and they were buying cheap Bitcoin. The fact it went up before makes no difference, because they were free to sell whenever they wanted and let someone else take the risk. The whole point of taking such a risk was to make profit *after* the situation normalized, selling now the risk has alleviated is against the entire principle of the additional risk of buying during the restriction. It doesn't hodl any water, it is nonsense. I really struggled to understand what you've been trying to say all this time because it is so illogical. 
There has been a 300USD increase in 24hrs, the situation could either normalize early, or it could have started a rally.

Could you elaborate please? If someone is using a VPN on the exchange and a different IP on BTC-E doesn't this method of "tracking" just fall to pieces? Because then it is impossible to prove if its you that owns the BTC-E wallet. Plus, it assumes a government would be able to get the BTC-E records and that wouldn't happen, it is in Russia. So its not "no problem" to get the records and its not possible to track the IP.

1.)They made a compromise based on what either side of the community want. They wanted us to support it and we decided immediately that we don't to.
2.) Semantics, i.e do they mean a 2mb hard fork then Segwit, or double the weight limit in Segwit 1mb.
3.) It's rushed (So is BIP148 but many of Core support that).
4.) They only want people who actually want it to succeed to be involved (that's pretty logical behavior...).
5.) We want the blocks to still be full. Just, less full.
6.) We don't need Bitcoin to scale at all ("Bitcoin is fine the way it is").
7.) This isn't even a point. Must have needed to beef up the post "TLDR: Core isn't a company").
8.) This isn't a point, it is literally a "see above", really trying to beef it up now.
Ending conclusion:- 
He thinks any one of these above points would mean it was dead on arrival which therefore includes because "see above" and because "Core isn't a company". 
**So to make a condensed version of the above:-**
Segwit2x is dead on arrival because they rushed into making a compromise incorporating what the entire community wants. They then only wanted people to contribute positively and they don't want blocks to remain full. Because Core isn't a company. See above.
Can you please provide a serious post on why you don't support it because this is really not adequate reasoning not to support the most universally supported solution (80%+ Hashrate, all the biggest Bitcoin companies, many users on both sides of the debate), that is also a *compromise* able to appease both sides, that we have **ever** had since this dispute began.

Segwit2x.....gives Segwit and a capacity increase, 80% of Hashpower, compromise between both sides, the biggest businesses support it, retains all present hashpower (security) ,Core doesn't support it.
BIP148....gives only Segwit, forces replay protection in the form of a new coin which could crash the price, forces the other sides hand pushing them further away worsening the dispute, almost zero hashpower so far, no big businesses support it yet, loses potentially 40% of the present hashpower (security), most of Core doesn't support it.
Hmmmmmmmmm.......which one looks better....

That's totally wrong. We were in the most turmoil we've ever just before Segwit2x signalling hit 90%.

Are you really trying to argue that these represent the real uses Ethereum has right now? They aren't even used by anyone. So tell me again how I'm awe-inspiringly stupid for saying it doesn't have any real uses yet. Because you just proved my point better than I ever could have myself.
I personally think its awe-inspiringly stupid that in the face of zero evidence this *will* have any ground breaking and popular uses that people are literally throwing their money into every 2 page white-paper on every crappy single landing page website going, for products not even developed let alone live and proven, in order to implement something on Ethereum that doesn't even need Ethereum to run!

I know exactly what Segwit does? It isn't guaranteed to resolve full blocks right now and people know this which is what the 2x is for, doing *that* should resolve all the issues now *and* in the foreseeable future allowing Side chains and the lightning network time to be developed and implemented which will resolve the scaling issues permenantly. It is so obviously good for Bitcoin to include the 2x that it *is* only trolls coming out against this agreement trying to further disrupt the community by trying to stop even a compromise working. But it won't work, Segwit2x is happening.
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:24:07
I couldn't say for certain, the problem is if you approach the bank manager and explain the situation and ask what they want from you in order to accept the funds they might tell you and then still go off and report the information. In that situation law enforcement would be able to demand access to the funds and you'd have to go to court to argue what you're saying above including paying the legal fees.
You could clarify the above with an accountant that specializes in this kind of thing I suppose (or compile it yourself),and hopefully the bank would take the evidence at face value. But if you're wanting 50,000USD+, its a bit of a long shot.

Interesting logic. Evidently you don't understand how this works, though. People don't **just** use their life savings to open businesses. That's actually a great position to be in. Normally they take out loans or get "funding" as well as using all their own available funds because if they could afford to do it with only their own money they wouldn't need to take on the additional risk and loss of share from loans or funding - this is totally normal behavior in business.
Now, with your own logic....."so the OP has *no* value. Case closed."
@_date: 2017-06-30 06:40:36


Really? 900k is *pocket change* for heavy investors in BTC and more so in gold. It is said  $125.3 billion per day is traded with Gold. The 24hr volume of BTC is 973,411,000USD right now and the holders don't even move their Bitcoin around.
That misses the point entirely anyway, are you going to carry 200g gold around with you? Do you think you could get that gold bar through airport security? Do you think you could easily deposit it in a vault and cash it in on demand in any country....from your living room? How vulnerable to theft would it be if you were carrying it with you all the time? But you can carry your Bitcoin with you in your memory and have no issue with any of the above.
As another poster mentioned "You don't need to trade the physical asset... they generally never see the gold", you actually have control over your Bitcoin. This is why it beats physical gold in literally every way now. You can send it anywhere without permission and you actually own it yourself rather than storing it in a vault. *There is literally not a single utility that gold has over Bitcoin.* If you aren't aware of this, you don't understand the most basic concepts of what Bitcoin offers to wealthy people and its almost entirely the wealthy people in Bitcoin that give its value right now. I say wealthy because non-wealthy people don't own any physical gold bars in the first place.
...and I say all this as someone that is an actual investor in gold, maybe that's why I appreciate its shortfalls. The only benefit of gold over Bitcoin is I know with certainty that it will have **some** value in 50 years. But to be honest I think the same about Bitcoin anyway.
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:42:29
I personally completely support Bitmain's position on this. It is perfectly reasonable to prevent a reorg as it stops people losing money and Segwit2x is clearly the best option by far. It has 80% hash power, increases capacity with the HF and gives us Segwit. The only people not supporting this are doing so based on their own personal agendas and that is becoming abundantly clear to the entire community now.
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:55:19

It's difficult to decipher exactly what it is you try to say. Between cancer analogies that make zero sense and the paradox that is "Centralized mining" it is almost impossible.
If I set up a mine tomorrow and invest 100M in mining and secure 30% of the hashrate, have I gamed the system? Should I be removed? No. Because I would only do it if it became a financially attractive proposition, i.e others with similar capital would *also* be inclined to do the same thing and the system becomes *more* decentralized because the amount of money required to secure a higher proportion of HR increased. If you remove me what are you telling to other people who initially found it an attractive business venture too? That they shouldn't risk the investment? Can you remove all the people who buy a lot of HR? Well, you can't change the POW every few months can you - so no.
So by removing people, you just make it *easier* for someone else to come and take up a *higher* percentage of the HR who could ultimately pose a problem too. The only way to prevent this is to have bigger and bigger mining operations that make it nearly impossible to dominate the HR purely because of the volume of money required to do that.
If we don't like that Bitmain controls too much we need to make investing in mining equipment more attractive so people buy in to reduce his percentage, not threaten to change the POW which just puts people off doing the very thing we need them to do - set up big mining operations. Who will invest 100M in ASIC mining right now when there are some clueless idiots requesting to change the POW in the name of "decentralization"!

I'll bite. Blockstream "blocked" the HF to bigger blocks in favor of Segwit, which they and much of the community (user and economic) consider to be a better approach.
Please explain the direct mechanism that exists *at this time* that allows them to directly profit from Segwit and strangle Bitcoin by supporting the use of Segwit. 
Once you've clearly proven this established mechanism, you are no longer a troll. However, for now, you just look like a teenager practicing his pseudo-intellectual "debating" skillz:-

...and it put ETH to **sleep** and under 20usd for 12 months. So I guess that's what we can expect, right?
@_date: 2017-06-22 08:26:42
People were saying this at 10USD, 50USD, 100USD, 200USD etc etc. They said don't buy at all at 1000USD, they said we'd crash back to 700USD when we were at 1500USD. 
The fact is a *lot* of people put their life savings into Bitcoin at *all* of these stages in including many people that I know. Many are millionaires now.
So when I see someone trying to put others off their already decided intention, I don't see it as something kind, they might save you some anxiety at times but far more realistically (and consistent with history for **7 years in a row** they're just stopping you making as much money in the long-term - which is the only reason you're investing anyway. So I don't think they're helping anyone, except themselves, who followed their own and secretly regret it immensely. 
I've been here the whole time watching the sentiment. There has never been a better time to buy than now, ETH is about to implode back into Bitcoin and the scaling debate that has raged for *2 years* is about to be resolved. I'm expecting to see a 5000USD minimum Bitcoin within months once Segwit gets implemented, this is genuinely conservative if the scaling issue is completely resolved i.e Segwit2x gets implemented as planned.
EDIT: To be honest, the only people that could be against this advice are people who were around but *didn't* do it years ago or simply don't understand what is happening in this space right now. Also, you can also bet there will be downvotes on this coming from people who take exception to what I said about ETH, they are very sensitive about reality.

No, I think investors or even ex-Bitcoiners or outsiders can't quite believe that Segwit2x could be the end of the scaling debate. I think the real rally will begin once we get to the point that everyone is agreeing that Segwit2x is inevitable.


Segwit2x will be activated before BIP148 and the support for BIP148 will evaporate into thin air. Segwit2x is insurance against a chain split. BIP148 is insurance against people backing out of Segwit2x. Everything in between is just confused people or people trying to spread fear. At 90% combined hashrate support for Segwit2x it is almost guaranteed to activate, but people spreading FUD keep most from really accepting the inevitable...yet.
@_date: 2017-06-22 18:33:00


I got in under 250USD and its literally been uphill since that point. People like you said the same back then. If you had listened to people like me you'd be wealthy from the choice, but you showed real naivety regarding the basics of picking investments at the right time.
Now I'm telling anyone reading, now is the right time to buy in. If Segwit2x gets implemented - which is just about certain - all the old use cases will be back, all the guys that left will be back, 3 kinds of lightning network will be implemented, rootstock for smart contracts will be implemented, it will start the new altcoin crash back into Bitcoin and the price will go parabolic dwarfing this recent rally.
Then you'll remember the naive guy that was telling people now is a good time to buy. I'll have upgraded my yacht. lol.
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:13:22
I don't know why I need to recount what was said when it just happened but if you look back I said he supports Segwit, you said "clearly not", I showed how blindingly obvious it is that he does and then you completely ignored my post and started talking about the NY agreement and not whether or not he supports Segwit which changes the subject....then you say I've changed the subject.
Also, as I just said in the post before you changed the subject I already addressed what you've just said as part of the reasoning for him clearly *supporting* Segwit. i.e he supported it in the HK agreement, he supported it since then, he supports it in the NY agreement with contains it and even plans to implement it (without the 'discount') if he forks off. The fact you still appear to believe he doesn't support Segwit even though he has clearly demonstrated support for the past 2 years non-stop it pretty absurd and frankly I'm bored of debating whether or not the sky is blue.
Good day.

Can you prove this? Not that Alex was the director of CANTON, that this is the parent company of BTC-E.
How do you know, for example, that Canton wasn't just Alex's shell company and he struck up a business relationship later on with BTCE, as a completely separate entity?
You seem to appreciate all the rationale for BTCE to deny something, but none of the rationale for a prosecutor to distort facts to align with what they're alleging - which it is their job to do.
The police misrepresent facts AND mislead INTENTIONALLY to secure convictions. If you don't appreciate and consider this, which you clearly don't, then you have no business commenting on the subject in this way in the first place because you are naive to the whole process. So, can you prove that CANTON is the parent company of BTCE since the inception of BTCE and exactly what their relationship is to one another? I'll take a guess, no. Without that, what is the rest of your post? It's nothing...
Also, please learn to use "cognitive dissonance" correctly, you mean denial. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:00:10
I'm not trying to have an argument but this is so obviously incorrect because the theory implies it isn't possible to increase capacity and that isn't true. 
The capacity is meant to be to be increased with the upcoming blocksize increase and implementation of Segwit, the idea is to create a bitcoin that can *scale* to fully meet user demand without excessive fees. The idea is the *volume* of fees will pay the miners, not fees that price out every use-case for Bitcoin just because millionaires around the globe happen to be able to afford that. 
Its beyond absurd to imply *that* is the purpose of Bitcoin, a niche asset for millionaires to use like decentralized gold and NOTHING ELSE. Please please don't tell me we have people in the community that actually think this?

Pro-ETH and some are even anti-Bitcoin now unfortunately. But it stems from frustration at the lack of progress with respect to scaling - however this has now been resolved with Segwit2x which is the middle ground of the entire debate and gives us everything people were arguing for. So the community is 'kind of' fractured, because we're about to see an influx of the old guys come back once the old use cases return and the fees drop significantly.
But be warned, you'd do better reading my summary and not going too much further because if you get dragged in its still unfortunately like quicksand....

It is only possible to regulate effectively if they literally stop international wires from outside of the EU....otherwise people just use offshore exchanges as standard and they stifle the growth of the industry within the EU for no real benefit. I suppose ultimately the plan is to essentially shut down all offshore exchanges in the same way they did with offshore bank accounts. This is doable but it will take many years and there are many ways around it with Crypto, unlike with banking.
It also doesn't account for Side chains and LN which would totally ruin this plan. I think the funding is really just to research the space at this point rather than do anything effective. The central register is the most likely conclusion of it.

Money laundering is a process of concealing or "creating" an origin - this *process* can be applied to clean or dirty money for many reasons.

I was supporting BIP148 but with this "contingency plan" from Bitmain it is literally an absolute disaster if Segwit2x doesn't activate first. This report is basically him saying "ok ok lets just compromise.....but if after all this time and debate if you still don't want to compromise with me then I'll make sure to destroy Bitcoin".
You might consider it him holding the network hostage.....but its trying to force a compromise which is the best possible resolution anyway. If Core *don't* want to compromise at this point then they indisputably become the problem in Bitcoin, by themselves, and also prove big blockers right since the very beginning and I really hope that hasn't been the case.

Lol "immaterial". Consensus represents agreement within the entire space - the consensus of any parameter that is important within Bitcoin is consensus. Consensus among users, consensus among miners, consensus among developers, consensus around the businesses.

I am not suggesting that, I'm saying a HF to 2mb last year would mean we wouldn't have this problem. Doing that would also have fulfilled the HK agreement and so we'd have Segwit by now too.

Thanks for the information, I think I understand. Though, what is the interaction between Segwit and the current 1mb blocksize? The witness data within the 1mb block is removed enabling more space for the Segwit enabled transactions?
Therefore if you raise the base blocksize to 2mb the witness data is now removed from the 2mb allowing more space within these blocks? Around 4mb block equivalent. The same concept applies as you are simply increasing the base blocksize, no other changes are required.
Why is there any confusion or complication with respect to raising the base blocksize that implies someone making such a request is clueless? It seems pretty straight forward to me, as a layman.

You are very fast at responding!


As an addition:- it was merely an example of how exiting the risk of fiat for certain people has benefits that far outweigh short-term volatility of Bitcoin. 
Even more critical would be the fact that if everyone abided by the "don't risk more than you can lose in Bitcoin" that there would be next to zero businesses even running in the space. So a moderator with influence pushing this narrative is extremely counter productive to development in the space.
If you were thinking of creating a start-up using your life savings and heard this from a figure-head, I wouldn't blame you for reconsidering the entire plan. After all, why risk more than you can afford to lose? Do we not want the space to grow?

That's not a "next" because it makes no sense...seriously, what are you banging on about? He supports Segwit2x and Chinacoin is a contingency plan to BIP148 and the plan is still to implement Segwit without the discount rate which will still disable covert asic boost.

The accusations I've been dismissing all this time are that certain people intend to cripple the Bitcoin network to force people to use second layer solutions that can be profited from. This is the first undeniable evidence of this being a possibility. With even a 20usd fee, which is - as he put it - 'much lower' the majority of normal users would be *forced* on to second chains. 
This is not ok. People should be able to choose to use lightning for their coffee transactions because its instant, not because they're *forced* to.

No, this needs to be as public as possible so that people can see he isn't actually for 20USD Bitcoin fees if that is the case. It also needs to be as public as possible so the whole community can at least rally around *one* thing which is the collective agreement that fees need to be low so that Bitcoin is inclusive and functions for its original purpose, not some distortion.
The fees in their current form are meant to represent teething problems, not a sign of things to come. They're meant to go back down and stay down, they should *never* go up to 20USD or 100USD and so discussing that implies it is a possibility and it should not be. The community are able to and must not let that be a possibility.

Just try to understand this very simple thing: what is written isn't actually about the terms of the NY agreement. It contains no details about the agreement itself, literally nothing. It is only about what happens *after* the agreement.

This is such a mess now. BIP148 is now officially guaranteed to ruin Bitcoins price and reputation. Segwit2x is literally the only way to move forward now and everyone still gets what they want. The hidden agendas are becoming blindingly visible...."No, Segwit2x is rushed...its risky". What the f...look at the alternative.
@_date: 2017-06-30 14:40:02


We are. In Segwit2x...which is earlier than both BIP148/BIP149. The miners won't activate it on just 141, we waited more than a year trying that and it didn't work... that's their prerogative. Segwit2x is the most guaranteed way *to* "just go ahead and activate it". You can be critical of it being rushed (but if its well tested so what) but calling to boycott those to support it?
 Not being pro-Segwit2x at this time is directly stalling development of Bitcoin and creating unneeded contention in the community and that isn't cool. So yes, I'm being serious... as are the rest of the community that caused this thread to be down-voted to 55% in a few hours.

He agreed to Segwit in the HK agreement if there's a HF, he has been saying all along he will still implement it if there's a HF, he's now agreed to the NY agreement which includes it and hes even said if he creates a new coin he will implement it without the 'discount'.

ETH will be dead or severely crashed within a few years because of countless technical problems facing Ethereum, other than being one of the most centralized cryptocurrencies in existence:-
But still, in spite of zero uses after 2 years the speculation is rampant. One of their own developer's thinks its best use case is "as lame as multisig" right now, sold his most of his ETH:-
"I have concerns due to the fact that commercial interests and adoption has far outpaced the tech research and development"
"What's the best utilization of smart contracts today?" -  
"- It's probably something as lame as a multisig" 
So, we can add "huge ETH crash" to the list of things that moons the Bitcoin price now....

Can you predict the centralizing effect of a simple increase in capacity from the HF vs the potential centralizing effect that would occur if it turned out there would only be a few giant lightning hubs? As I said, we cannot see into the future, so you have no clue which would end up having more of a centralizing effect. It is possible to argue that both might and its possible to argue that both won't.

Ok, but those who are ignorant and easily lead have no bearing on the outcome because its only a technical issue? No, they do influence the outcome because they represent part of the consensus model within Bitcoin. Ergo the dispute has a social dynamic and the social media campaigns, press releases, twitter votes and polls that occur almost daily appeal to the social aspect of the debate in order create a social consensus to resolve the issue in the desired way.
It took a while but we're there and it is plain as day.

We have a big problem in this community, it is termed "shilling" or "astroturfing" (whether rightly or wrongly used) and it potentially takes place on both sides of the community. It is where people with many fake accounts OR with their only account make an overt effort to give the appearance of a popular opinion in order to sway the community one way or another in order to help manipulate a certain outcome.
In r/btc the aim of the game is to scare people away from Bitcoin using conspiracy theories about Core and Blockstream into ETH and here the name of the game (was, it doesn't really happen so much now but it used to be very bad) was to sway people away from bigger blocks.
There have been people who had their githubs exposed and code was found which notified them of *any* post in either sub so they could go and push their opinion with however many accounts they have to sway the discussion. The guys doing it here with the *right* agenda (at the time) were safe, but the guys doing it with the *wrong* agenda all got banned....and moved to rbtc.
It is especially rampant in rbtc now days, if you go there any time and actually evaluate the comments and threads with the pretense of people trying to "push people away from Bitcoin to ETH" you'll suddenly realize how prevalent it is. 
For example if I criticize LukeJr here, some will agree with me, if I criticize certain things about Core here some will agree with me. Go and make a comment criticizing ETH there and see what happens, even in r/ethtrader you can criticize it without the same affect because the aim of the game is to sway the *bitcoin* users away to facilitate the "flippening" - that's the new agenda.

This is from an earlier post of mine in this thread:-


By doing this you could swap 1btc with millions and millions of new people, there is literally nothing that could be done (ever) to stop this as long as crypto exists.
Actually getting the money has just as many ways, from buying mining equipment anonymously as an investment, to cash exchanges in person. 
Edit: As a side point this method is totally over the top, it would be sufficient just dumping them in and then pulling them out of an anonymous exchange that is outside of the judicial ability of the country the funds "originated" from. This is because many exchanges "pool" their holdings between the entire customer base, so you put in 1btc and receive 10,000 fragments of other people's btc to get your 1btc out.

I would naturally believe Luke and I saw his explanation about it before, but the posts that were removed make it clear that the rules were functioning as a little blacklist against what he considered to be spam and it isn't his job to determine that - so he voluntarily instated a blacklist without even consulting anyone.

Jihan is prepared to compromise, even rbtc is prepared to compromise, 40% of the total hashpower is prepared to compromise for 80% total hashpower. The users at large are prepared to compromise. The businesses are prepared to compromise. So tell me, who is the only group left that *aren't* prepared to compromise? Why? Because its rushed? But 2 months for BIP148 without any guaranteed miner support *isn't* rushed?
What kind of "compromise" is it when you're bundling *two* benefits in one? We need Segwit for various reasons, we need much larger capacity right now, Segwit2x gives both. Come and argue the bullsh*t reasons why you don't support this compromise, because if you allude to "its rushed" or "it doesn't follow procedure" then promote BIP148 UASF you need to reevaluate your position.

"past performance is guarantee for future results".
Didn't ETH flash crash to 13USD today and go under 1USD on Gdax? Did it split in two and do nothing around 10USD for 2 years? Was it worth 10USD 3 months ago?
ETH hasn't had a single yearly percentage increase above 10USD yet. Actually, it's spent about 10x more time below 10USD than above.  If you were to summarize ETH's past performance it would be: Abysmal.

I don't think I do, I'm a professional trader myself. There will be huge price movements and a rally that will dwarf the recent one if we approach activation without any hiccups. Right now is potentially a dream buy-in opportunity for anyone that knows what's going on because its before the wider market even accepts the solution is even possible.
We still have ETHtards telling people to dump Bitcoin and buy ETH because the scaling debate will never resolve, to be honest even I don't think its 100% guaranteed because the debate has been so contentious. Still at this point we have no idea if someone will do something crazy. So there is no way, literally no way that the average trader will be thinking its guaranteed. We'll have tonnes of news articles everywhere the second it looks like its guaranteed, that's when it will "start" and when institutional investors will start entering. 
When this situation resolves there will be a new round of global adoption that will raise the price organically, most traders will enter just before this, not just before we even have a definite resolution.

Also, what you're referring to is known as structuring and the pre-requirement is that the full sum was available all along and you chose specifically to break it up to avoid the reporting requirement. However if you can distort that (easy with Bitcoin) or 'prove' you didn't have the full sum originally it isn't structuring and isn't illegal...and it also prevents you from getting automatically reported.

There is no way in hell the community will ever support a POW change. Suggesting otherwise is a completely out of touch with reality.

This is what I was arguing for too. With Segwit we get some immediate relief, implement LN and see how it does, there is no rush to increase blocksize when we have other options available.
With the people I was trying to convince, I got nowhere. They're stuck in what appears to be conspiracy theories and won't budge. They don't seem reasonable but they're still part of this community and that is why my position is where it is now.
I'm disappointed to see -4 points on my post above, I'm literally being the moderate voice. It just shows to me we still have an rbtc element within us.
Both sides tried to bully and force a resolution on the other, it didn't work, it would never work. The solution was always to compromise and we only have such entrenched views by some because of how long this went on for *before* we listened to the other side.

Anyone long on ETH on the exchange would have had their entire account liquidated, there are many many reports of it online. This is basically a clear warning not to long ETH on margin if at least on Gdax. Note that whoever did it lost millions to do it. People are just hoping it was an accident, something tells me (common sense) that if you make 30 million trading crypto you aren't going to make such an "accident".
The fact is, because ETH is in such a huge bubble there are LOADS of people that hold huge amounts, every time one of these big guys cashes out now this same thing could happen if they want it to. But r/ethtrader are trying to pretend its a positive thing, which is just ridiculously delusional.

@_date: 2017-06-08 15:45:10
100%. This nothing to do with sides or friends. It is about one thing, inclusively scaling Bitcoin. We talk about decentralization, but did we forget literally one guy can block upgrades for the entire network? Did we forget literally one guy sells almost all the miners and could just stop selling them one day and keep them? What is decentralization when a single person has this much power? The issue of handing more power to miners only exists because we need more asic manufacturers and it exists *without* bigger blocks already!
But this is beside the point, that should resolve itself, the actual point is do this damn agreement already and implement the 2MB HF and Segwit. Set up the layer 2 and side chain industry and get it strong and efficient. Lets stop messing around for gods sake.
@_date: 2017-06-22 11:14:28
BIP148 is for Segwit and Segwit2x is for Segwit. Segwit2x includes doubling the capacity of Segwit a few months later.
They are essentially the same thing, but Segwit2x as an agreement represents the intention to also take further steps to scale Bitcoin in the immediate future.
The reason BIP148 is popular is because its only since this was in existence that everyone else decided enough was enough and they created Segwit2x.
Some people were therefore of the view that it was created only to take support away from BIP148. However, all the miners then signaled for Segwit2x, support is around 90% for it already. So its kind of a guaranteed that Segwit2x gets implemented.
However, because of how long this debate raged on for people are worried about devious tactics as though all the Bitcoin miners would suddenly change their mind and renege on the agreement if support for BIP148 dipped. Hence these posts.
You could argue they are being a bit paranoid, but it seems everyone in this space will remain paranoid until Segwit *actually* gets implemented and its double capacity *actually* gets implemented. Because funnily enough the paranoid on the "other side" also think Segwit2x is a trick, a trick to get Segwit but not double its capacity. 
They argue for the 2mb "hardfork" but don't understand that the meaning of this changes once Segwit is implemented, although is represents something similar, they are now arguing simply for doubling Segwit's weight capacity.
Then you still have in the mix all the people that left for ETH who are still pretending to be Bitcoiners and taking any side of the argument that appears to imply the solution remains contentious (see rbtc).
Basically, some really loud and paranoid people on either side of a debate-fence slinging shit at each other with opportunistic altcoiners providing the shit-ammo while all the normal people already left the field and are celebrating the resolution.
EDIT:- Even I'm impressed with how clear this explanation is, patting myself on the back...lol.

BTC has the highest market cap for now, has a debate over the blocksize which will eventually get resolved, has 6 years more fundamentals than ETH and can scale in multiple ways.
Stay for another 6 months to see the conclusion of the scaling debate in BTC :-).

The plan right now is Segwit and a 2mb HF, this allows us to employ Lightning in the most efficient way which can develop into an entirely new industry around Bitcoin promoting growth. The HF combined with Segwit should significantly relieve the pressure in the immediate term allowing some time for the second layer development/industry to really take shape. If they don't develop how we want them to then its back to the drawing board, but I don't see why it will fail. So in spite of what you seem to think the plan we have does represent a logical scaling road-map that is likely to work.
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:06:30

Unfortunately what you're trying to do now is essentially money laundering, which is a surprisingly common thing in normal large scale business. If you cannot prove the source of the funds every step of the way for a sum like this then your only method is to come up with a source of the funds that allows you to provide enough evidence of which cannot be easily disproved. 
This is exactly the reason why people use offshore companies, off shore brokers, foundations and trusts.....literally the only purpose of them when used by the wealthy in a business context is to obscure the transaction history so you can just make it up and no one can say otherwise.
People can't really explain in any detail because this is public record and it would indicate they know too much about this subject. You need really just to do your own research behind closed doors.
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:43:14
I read it all carefully and I fully appreciate the points. I still think it is the best option and most likely to actually scale Bitcoin, it just represents higher risk from the fact that it is rushed. Just like the higher risk of BIP148, like the high risk of Bitmain coin, like high risk of no scaling or layer 2's, like the high risk of waiting months and BIP149 not working - it is all high risk now.
@_date: 2017-06-15 09:29:27
It's incompatible with BIP148, not with Segwit, it is Segwit per its original design. But it is possible that it will soon be compatible with BIP148 in which case we can do both.

Sorry, but no it isn't and I have absolutely no idea how you've even devised such an analogy because it is not applicable in anyway other than implying the assertion is illogical. Which it isn't, it is perfectly logical and extremely easily understood so I'm not sure why you had difficulty.
If the fees are 100USD, how will you send 30USD to your son? It will cost you 130USD. If you want to send your wife 30USD quickly while she is out so she can pick up the shopping how can you do that if the fees are 20USD?
Bitcoin is meant to be digital cash, not a niche asset, decentralized digital gold, exclusively for millionaires simply because they can afford the 100USD fee and there is enough of them using it to prop up the price/fee. That is the most shameful and disgraceful conclusion to Bitcoin I could ever imagine.

Bitcoin is meant to be a peer to peer digital cash. A store of value for normal people, a remittance means, to bank the unbanked......its not just a decentralized nothing with no uses. Bitcoin has value because of its *uses* along with its decentralization. Isn't that obvious? What use is something that is decentralized when it barely has any use?

He agreed to Segwit in the HK agreement, he said for the last 2 years he still wants Segwit provided the HF comes, he has agreed to it in the NY agreement, he even plans to implement Segwit without the discount rate in his Chinacoin - on what planet doesn't he want Segwit? You might dislike him and his contingency plan, and that's fair enough, but come on don't go full retar....

@_date: 2017-06-18 10:35:55
Calculation that refutes it? Common sense refutes it.
Scenario 1:- I have Bitcoin and want to send some to Bob, rings Bob gets his address and sent within 5 minutes, 30 minutes later its in his wallet with a couple of confirmations. Time taken: 35min max and zero hassle.
Scenario 2:- I have cash and want to WU some to Bob, drive to the shop/location (5 minutes to 25 minutes average for city people, could be anything for rural areas). Assuming there is no queue ( usually is and this can take 15 minutes easily), spend 10 minutes filling out the form, they spend 5 minutes photocopying your ID, then 5 minutes putting it in the system then 5 minutes processing your cash and giving the receipt. Then ring Bob and give the MTCN, now *he* has to drive to the location, fill out a stupid 10 minute form, assuming there is no queue, then person at the till spends 5 minutes putting the information in and counting out the money and 5 minutes photo copying and filing the ID. Total time:- Easily more than 50 minutes combined every-time and a LOT of inconvenience.
I've personally seen people spend 30 minutes in a queue, then 30 minutes just sending the money in Banks before *Just* sending the money, because I was behind them dammit. Same for those receiving. I've even seen people wait 30 minutes in a queue just to find a letter is wrong or the system blocked it. Comparing Bitcoin with WU just means you have no idea what using WU is actually like.
Also, the last time I checked sending 1k through Western Union was like 50USD, so you really have no clue what you're talking about. I can send 50k through Bitcoin for 2USD and its anywhere in the world 20 minutes later.

Are you kidding? You didn't say anything at all and not only that, extremely ironically now, but you totally ignored my questions with respect to the only potentially valid point you *did* make:-




Are you serious? You genuinely think it works like this? Embarrassing. Your "rebuttal" made no sense, you asked me what my "point" was even though I had written absolutely thoroughly to explain what I was saying. You thought I was criticizing the fact he was stating the obvious when my post was not even about that - literally - at all.


Sincerely, I can see why you are so eager to "case close" this.


I'm really trying to stay respectful but I am shocked someone like yourself managed to open a business at all with the logic and reasoning ability demonstrated in this exchange - if you are being serious. Firstly, I'm not advising people to start businesses, so I don't know why you think I recommend using one form of capital over another, I'm merely stating facts. Facts that you are trying to dispute on the basis of "Well, I didn't so no one does". Seriously, what?
"77 percent of small businesses rely on personal savings for their initial funds."
So, are you really saying every single Bitcoin start-up that used their savings (which is apparently about 77%, this doesn't include those that got loans or funding) should have listened to OPs advice and not invested? Is it sinking in yet how absolutely stupid an assertion that is with respect to the *needed* development in this space?
@_date: 2017-06-20 11:50:28

I really hope you're correct. I really like Adam Back based on our previous interactions and I told him just a couple of weeks ago I think *he* is the one to resolve this disagreement. But what he has said is being used as ammunition against Bitcoin and so it *needs* clarification. 
Then, in the future if this is ever quoted we can direct them to where he explains himself and it is no longer usable as a propaganda tool. Too many are already wrongly pushed away from Bitcoin on false narratives, lets not give another one if it can be avoided.

"Increasing the blocksize (at all) WILL destroy bitcoin."
Segwit is a blocksize increase.
"...I'm hoping Segwit won't do this."
If you think the difference between Bitcoin being **destroyed** and being absolutely fine is your 'hope' then you really need to evaluate your stance. Because it sounds absurd.
We've spoken earlier and I'm just repeating myself, increasing the blocksize has a *potential* to increase centralization because frankly you have no idea how many people will be running nodes or mining operations in the future *irrespective* of the blocksize and you have *no idea* just how many lightning hubs will eventually be popular in the future. 
Talking in the black and white way you have just done makes it so extremely easy to find holes in your logic and makes it very easy to dismiss what you are saying even though there is *some* merit to it. It just needs to be reeled in a bit so it represents reality a little more and accounts for the fact you can't look in the future.
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:26:00

@_date: 2017-06-08 15:27:26
Yes you did, and you don't realize it. You said the following:-


You said the fee will continue to rise, excluding more and more people until the blocks are no longer full and at *that* time the market fee has been determined. This assumed that capacity can be reached at some point and that Bitcoin therefore cannot scale inclusively. It also implies that the fair market fee should be determined by the very highest average level the entire world is prepared to pay. That means if enough millionaires decide to use Bitcoin as decentralized gold and are all prepared to pay 100USD per fee to move their money around - then that is acceptable.


While you might think decentralized niche digital gold exclusively to be used by millionaires is acceptable if the market determines that, I do not (I don't really think you want that). It is a shameful conclusion for Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a purpose. It must scale inclusively and capacity should *not* be reached. There should never be a 100USD fee, through the use of layer 2's / side chains and on chain scaling.
@_date: 2017-06-09 07:58:18
Just for everyone's general knowledge, $10,000USD is *the official* amount to assume criminal activity in the banking sector. Do not ever use this round number, **ever**.

I wrote this to a similar comment:-
If we rationalize in the style of a contortionist then it is very easy to find truth in all manner of statements. I don't think trying to justify the sentence structure is worth anything when the actual implication is that 20/100usd fees would be okay. Clarification is essential because of what this really means for Bitcoin given his influence in the space.

They have been getting better recently, at one point all pro-bitcoin posts were getting down voted. But right now there's  a thread and people actually are agreeing to compromise with Segwit2x which is absolutely brilliant.
But you should realize, while what you're saying is true they can easily say that this thread is the puppeteer thread because you have been a redditor for 3 months and the first comment for 3 weeks.

Over the past 2 months all I have heard about in is how BTC is dead and ETH is the future. How BTC won't ever scale and we're all idiots for being bag holders to the inevitable flippening. 
They've actively campaigned to FUD Bitcoin in the Bitcoin subs to convert people away from Bitcoin using theories that made it appear impossible for Bitcoin to scale. Even the mod in rbtc made a giant fud post about BTC and told them to go to ETH. 
Now that ETH's crash and burn started early, suddenly we're best friends again? I never had an issue with ETH or their holders, but they spent the last two months endlessly mocking our 'demise' and now we aren't even allowed to point out facts?
...like the fact there was a blood bath flash crash to 0.1USD ETHUSD on the gdax exchange today.
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:04:53
Because immutability, with respect to Bitcoin, automatically refers to the ledger only? You are needlessly obnoxious, I'm such an idiot for using the actual definition of the word aren't I? The benefit of immutability could easily be applied to the POW for someone who bases their **entire** livelihood on Bitcoin mining and never had a reason to anticipate it to change. In which case the benefits of Bitcoin's presumed immutability applies, and drives investment, in multiple ways....so you are the idiot. Are you paid to act like one?

From what is being said by the entire community for the last two years Segwit is guaranteed. *Provided* there is also a HF; the miners said they'd implement it in HK, never stopped saying they will implement it and now include implementing it in their own road-map. Based on that its clear the intention, it is exactly as they've said all along.

Segwit won't resolve these issues right away. Segwit is a long term solution when combined with lightning. We need bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:28:57
ETH's market cap needs to be more than 7.5x that of Bitcoins to be the price bitcoin is right now. That means even if *everyone* stops using BTC and uses only ETH it still won't match today's price. Additionally, if that happened your blockchain would break, seeing as during yesterdays ICO sale it already started to malfunction.....this is all before ETH is even *used* for anything and some of your own developers don't think it will scale. If that's the case, what happens to all the funding? Refunds? That's all aside from the fact many of these ICO's are basically a scam that will end up being shut down - what legitimate reason does a start-up, with no product even developed yet, need 30million USD?
@_date: 2017-06-25 06:27:55


You are very lucky. But, check this out:-
If you're prepared to put in a little more work you can make 5x the return of Bitcoin mining. Theres a GPU set up for 8kEUR on some website and using that you can make over 120USD a day if you mine the right things. For under 20k start up you could make 60k a year literally sitting on your ass.

Thanks. So blocksize isn't actually a thing the way it exists right now once segwit is implemented, we just have the MWU limit which represents the *equivalent* in blocksize increase thereafter? 
Does this introduce any complications, for example imagine if Lightning ends up DOA and no one wants to lock any funds in and we are forced to scale on chain - could we continue to raise the MWU in the same way we can just continue to raise the blocksize right now?
Again, thanks for your sincerity, I'm not a developer I'm just a normal guy trying my best not to be ignorant about something I profess to advocate for (Segwit combined with blocksize increases [oops]).
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:34:50
There is nothing in this press release that even refers to Segwit2x before its implementation, it is all in reference to what is done in the event of the failure of Segwit2x. That's why its titled "Contingency plan".

@_date: 2017-06-11 08:01:03
But we need Bitcoin to have a completely centralized development team and a leader that dictates to us. We need a system of funding through illegal securities that makes it extremely easy for people to get sucked into the hype of new products so that if just *one* of them doesn't perform as expected people lose their money and file class action law-suits that pull BTC into the negative spot-light. We need to go back, before BTC had any uses and bring in unfathomable amounts of new-dumb-money during a crypto-bull rally where even non-mineable coins get pumped 30% in a day so at the first sign of the bear market 50% of the new-money cashes out.
We need Bitcoin to have a catastrophic failure within the first year and leak millions of coins, *while working as designed* and then split in two in order to undo the mess simultaneously destroying the value for many of the early adopters who chose the wrong chain..... at the whim of the leader.

I appreciate this. I'm not trying to be rude to the OP at all, I respect him and his position. But my points are valid, we are well past this stage  of "ooh Bitcoin could go to zero tomorrow", now. 
If everyone abides by the "don't risk more than you can lose in Bitcoin" that there would be far far fewer businesses even running in the space, it  applies to miners and investors too. So a moderator with influence pushing this narrative is extremely counter productive to development in the space.
If you were thinking of creating a start-up using your life savings and heard this from a figure-head, I wouldn't blame you for reconsidering the entire plan. After all, why risk more than you can afford to lose? 
"77 percent of small businesses rely on personal savings for their initial funds."
Maybe I'm being pedantic in some people's opinion, but I think it sends out a message that this space is far more immature than it really is. We're almost 10 years deep now, its a legal currency in a few countries and we now know how we will scale...its volatile and everyone knows that but people should be able to invest what they want based on their own circumstances in my opinion.

Haha it was just a typo, I used "BIP" in the previous thousand times I wrote about it. But thanks!

We likely need layer 2's AND on-chain scaling now. Layer 2's are a *potential* resolution that allows us to keep the blocksize smaller. But a small blocksize is just preferential, its not an "at all costs".

Craig Wright as SN as well. This is funny.
If you were asking for ETH though you'd actually get investors. The only thing I notice was you have different pages for each section, that's a dead give away because the actual ICO's I've seen all use a **single page**. When you click it just scrolls down to the next section, I'm dead serious.

What a joke. Ethereum is a smart contract enabled blockchain of whom value is derived only from its theoretical ability to revolutionize how businesses are run. No one even uses it for that yet and its already failing.
Bitcoin IS a payment network that still functions for its purpose after 8 years, albeit with higher fees. I just don't get the delusion of ETH guys, If there were any big businesses running on ETH right now they would be totally screwed. "I'll put some eth petrol in, oh wait can't leave the petrol station because there's an ICO".
@_date: 2017-06-04 17:22:58
I really hope these guys succeed. This is also what Bitcoin is about.
@_date: 2017-06-01 07:28:42
...at what point do the investors realize it isn't going to happen? It has been 2 years now. After 6 months everyone knew *exactly* how Bitcoin would change the world. But still no one knows how ETH will. On top of that there are aspects of it that are breaking US Law, the ICOs which will end up being investigated. I think ETH is the biggest bag holder scheme going right now if I'm brutally honest.

I don't know how your misunderstanding this, he says above:-
"If we can't all agree to move forward with the NY agreement and the BIP148 still splits the chain in a high risk way, then this is our contingency plan:-"
But still, you don't answer how it is possible  that you can deduce something about his intention within the NY agreement, when he doesn't say anything about the terms of the agreement.
To remind you, your title in this thread claims that in this press release he changes the terms of the NY agreement and no longer supports Segwit as was originally agreed in the NY agreement. Not only does he not say that, he doesn't even talk about the terms.
So please, once again, how can you deduce something about his intention within the NY agreement, when he doesn't even say anything about the terms of the agreement?

I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about. You appear to have totally misunderstood the nature of our entire exchange if you somehow think what you've said makes sense in the .
But anyway, as I said, have a good day.

Does anyone have a definitive use case for lightning? For example, I plan to go out to eat at bars and clubs (I don't) and I always spend under 200USD so I load 200USD into the bars and clubs hub and now I can buy instantly in bars and clubs with lightning? It just doesn't sound worth the effort when I can just use a debit card. Why would anyone actually bother to do this? Or would it be a hub for everything?
Please someone that understands lightning explain a use case where someone *actually* would bother to use it. I've always been pro lightning but never actually thought about it, it seems pretty far fetched...

ICOs are the worst thing that has ever happened to crypto and Bitcoin needs to stay well, *well* away from them. Even a loose association is a potential disaster. ETH is literally a ticking time bomb of obliterated investment because of ICOs.

@_date: 2017-06-25 06:24:14
Yeh that's true as well. I didn't know how to phrase, BIP148 is the only reason they decided to actually do something and Segwit2x as a compromise is the only reason there is consensus.

Isn't it ironic that the once "Land of the free", that was built on the genocide of native Americans and slavery of Black people, is now single handedly responsible for removing liberties from almost the entire World. KYC, AML, TSA - which is really for asset confiscation, Terrorist groups, "tax sharing agreements" and most of the recent wars all initiated and perpetuated by the USA. No doubt the new slave nation, the EU, learning from their US masters will implement equally disgusting and thieving policies.
How did they possibly achieve this? How did so many people, in the most advanced Country in the world containing the most "free" people in the World, let this happen? Because they were systematically poisoned both physically and mentally - 10 years ago you'd sound like a conspiracy theorist saying this kind of thing, now *everyone* knows it happens and its just too late to stop without difficulty.
No need to worry, as long as you stay over-weight and taking your anti-depressants and statins while drinking your fluoride water and keep keeping up with the Kardashians. Can you guys please start doing something about this...? It's starting to look like they didn't stop black slavery at all over there, they just made you *all* slaves to the Government.

Segwit2x has 80% of the hash-rate. Its the most likely to activate out of every option right now by far. 
If he wants to keep his asicboost advantage why has it set it up such that if Core support Segwit2x it is guaranteed to activate and remove this capability for him?
Why did he support Segwit in the HK agreement? Why has he been saying he still supports Segwit provided it comes with the HF for the last 2 years? Why has he agreed to the NY agreement which containts Segwit? Why has he said even if the NY agreement doesn't work he will still implement Segwit on his own fork...........all of this but  he doesn't want Segwit. Come on, conspiracy will only let you go so far before logic kicks in.

There is no use for ETH right now, its price is completely speculative. Show us one successful use case for ETH in the last 2 years. Where it is not just a dead-end "trial" or in funding.

I don't even know what you're trying to say, but given this sub is generally against hard forks I assume you're saying "look at the absolute pile of shit occurs that if you hard fork, namely, look at the corrupt decadent war mongering slave and genocide built USA".

I get what you're saying but lets face facts - if it is *only* technical, why is there any discourse occurring with respect to different implementations at all? Why are there social media campaigns? Why are their public votes every week?

Don't pretend you have a crystal ball, Segwit2x could activate and you have no idea whether or not it will.

Segwit2x is does not have a centralizing effect any more so than any other potential protocol may or may not have. We cannot see into the future.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:55:59
Reneging on deals is shameful and does not represent the stance of rbitcoin. We aren't two faced on this side of the community. Segwit2x is a compromise from both sides and should be respected as such.
