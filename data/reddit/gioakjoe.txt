Yea s9 and l3+ are great especially if u can get on the base price and not the 3500 resalers want. I feel they are s great investment especially if btc growth slows down and we don't see these daily 20% jumps

My miner pays out every day so i enjoy dips as long as it goes up in the future.

Nvidia 1050 GTI is a entry-level gpu that can have as low as 2gb and amd rx550 2gb is entry level amd gpu both of these are 2gb cards and are profitable to mine

nicehash got hacked and people lost $60 million in bitcoin and its a major mining for Ethereum and other alt coins in exchange for bitcoin

I make about 50k year and with all the miners I have it's starting to equal about the same as my income a month. So many days at work thinking of how I could just quit and live off my miners income.

Depends on asic miners yes some of my gpu miners don't since it converts it to btc

I started with just my one computer then I went to buying gpu miners with 6 gpu per computer from there I started getting asic miners. I have 2 l3+ and 2 s9. I use nice hash on everything so all my miners pay out in btc. I'm probably in about 15k hardest part was getting my server room cool I use 2 window units. Next was how to power this I had an electrician put a breaker box in my server room and made new 20amp service for 110v and some 220v for the asic miners. In hind site it would of been more profitable to put 15k back when I started btc was around 2800-3000 price... But I enjoy getting those daily pay outs now. Days when btc is stagnet or in a dip it makes it easier to hold knowing it's btc from minners and I put in btc everyday so I buy dips I buy ath it's like putting money in a 401k from every paycheck.

basicly increases hash rate by spliting the load but yes you will make more with more cards
use the caculator to see an estamate of what your cards will make you.

this could be stealing even if you got the ok unless every one in the office was ok with this. Id say let the company Mine and use it to give profit sharing and bonuses to all employs as the safest way to go

@_date: 2017-11-10 16:29:23
I think you are confused I do do that but I want to make it clear to set what u pay in electric cost and that nice hash defaults to.10cents kwh and not every one pays that  so yes I agree with u just out in ur electric cost nice hash caculating will do everything

I head the name change is only if B2X sucseeds over BTC

When in GDAX Withdraw or Deposit click the Coinbase Account tab its that ez and its free to transfer and instant

GPU miners dont mine BTC they Mine ALT coins there is a miner that can mine ALT coins and pay you in BTC though called NICEHASH
as of right now 
R9 290 makes 0.00025194 BTC 1.82 USD a day
as profitability that depends on how much you pay on electricity, electricity will cut in from the $1.82 cost like for me it would eat up about 80cents a day to run
put in your KWH u pay for electricity

im a minner with both gpu and asic miners had i spent the same money on BTC at 3000 = 1btc when i started and used that money that i bought miners to buy btc instead Id of made alot alot more money at the moment i do enjoy the passive income and it giving me BTC deposits every day but fact of the matter is with btc rising so sharp so fast its just not as smart to buy miner gear as it would be to just put into btc. if the price stabilizes or slows down then yes mining would be the way to go
