I am a police officer in the United States and I have to weigh in.  Not knowing what country you are from makes it difficult, but I'll give you the perspective from the US. 
When I seize funds related to illegal activity, say a drug ring, that money can only be held for 60 days and must be linked to the "fruits of the crime" during that time. 
In that time we must file in civil court to seize the funds. If we don't we become liable for damages. 
Now from a money laundering standpoint, BtC doesn't really fit the bill for doing this. It can move the money from one hand to another, but by definition, you want the money to look legit. 
I suppose that this is possible by pointing to the blockchain and saying that certain transactions are yours when they are not. But you don't have to actually make a transactions to do this. 
If I were you I would immediately ask to see the legal paperwork holding my funds in limbo. I agree with 90% of the posts and think the police are over reaching. 
Furthermore the only way that I could see this cash being traced is if it was injected to a large criminal enterprise by serial number or marking. Or a bank robbery.

I just want to read about Bitcoin in Mac-speak. Every time I read something that isn't higher level technical "how it works" stuff seems to be window based.

Perhaps, but I don't think it should be compared to gold. Maybe compare it to stocks, bonds, or gold index. 
Comparing a intangible to a tangible..,,,,I don't see the connection.

Well they still require some form of paperwork (ie court order) to continue to hold it.

Why did Electrum works so well for you vs the others.

Gold is a physical item. Bitcoin is not. Your analogy holds no water.

I was leaning towards the sale of non-illicit goods or services.

Sorry. I'll make sure it's correct in the future.
