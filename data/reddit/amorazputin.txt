well I was under the impression that all companies do share with users when their account information is subpoenaed by government agencies. I did cash out into USD a significant portion just recently, so there is probably a year till they look into this year's trades and me to pay the taxes. however what are the options to find out such trades for someone using a non US exchange or altcoins exchange?  that's a big loop hole that they are not going to be able to plug effectively, thus resulting in people claiming they are being selectively targeted for using coinbase

arent coinbase required by law to inform users whose information they have been asked to turn over?

yeah I'll be consulting with my tax lawyer. I pay my takes on non crypto investments on time so it's not a hassle later on. however I have my doubts if they would be able to get international exchanges to comply, if at all. they have no jurisdiction to compel them to. also, decentralised exchanges again might be a grey area- I can buy bitcoin on coinbase, move that to a dex make my gains on alts and cash out to btc and back to usd on kraken or gemini, it may not be possible to trace these trades. especially if they are spread out over 2 years. 
I assume IRS and the government is under pressure from banks to control the rise of crypto because it slowly spells death for the existing debt based fiat system

this clown r/atlasrand1 has no idea what cryptos are and how a market works. he is a butthurt kiddie who senselessly screams scam scam scam at every possible opportunity he can while providing nothing for proof except conjectures and assumptions. anything that he dislikes is labelled "dirty money" "scam" "worthless" etc 
clowns like him unfortunately make up the majority of the kids in crypto today who suffer from a lack of basic trading knowledge but since they have a twitter or medium account, consider themselves to be experts in the domain  
fucking clowns

transactions in nano do cost electricity. look at it this way, internet is free isnt it? doesnt take any money to browse a site. yes you are paying for the bandwidth and someone else paying for the hosting, but inherently the internet was free when it came about. in the 90's you could create a website and it would cost nothing. it got monetised over time. nano simply aims to be a layer of currency native to the tcp protocol. right now it looks free but it can over time be monetised in several ways. 
dunno about iota as imo they have taken on more than they can chew. yea they do have a large size team but the basics seem off there.

hosting the website in the 90's was free and i know because i hosted several websites back then. even .com websites were free around 97. not even talking about geocities which were free till 2000 or so. 
if you even read my post i do mention the hosting costs but they were all subsidised early on for the end user who wanted to put up the website. after 2000 though you could virtually not find a .com website host for free. it became monetised and heavily at that. 
  
your post suggests you know very little about the history of the internet, so do learn about how it evolved. 


my post starts with this premise, i clearly mention transactions are not free.

what really sucks is jay clayton rejecting it, while in front of the congress he pretended otherwise.
