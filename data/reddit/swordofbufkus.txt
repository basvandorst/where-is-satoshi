Maybe you dipshits shouldn't have voted for the dumbass republicans responsible for those bailouts and wars.

You must be one of those retarded anti-semite shitfucks who think Soros is involved in some kind of conspiracy.
@_date: 2019-11-16 01:05:03
how do you even live with yourself?
@_date: 2019-11-06 13:43:22
serious question but why are these idiots using bitcoin for ordinary purchases? did they not learn from the guy who spent 15,000 bitcoin on a pizza?
@_date: 2019-11-30 04:07:13
NK doesn't buy anything. They steal.
@_date: 2019-11-24 00:09:45
forbes is a piece of shit conservative site run by republican assholes, that's why.

I don't like him, nor will I fight for his right to free speech. You obviously don't seem to understand that the first amendment only applies to the government censoring you, not private companies which are free to ban and censor from their platforms whomever they want.

Actually I highly doubt Satoshi Nakamoto gave a shit about this when he invented bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-06 13:42:09
Stossel is a fucking idiot and a bigot so who gives a shit?
@_date: 2019-11-06 13:43:41
Too bad it had little impact on the price.
@_date: 2019-11-08 11:27:26
and it had zero effect on the price
@_date: 2019-11-30 04:17:40
lol how the fuck would you know if they are always full of lies? you sound like one of those tinfoil hat wearing dumbasses who believe everything posted on 4chan.
@_date: 2019-11-06 13:41:54
@_date: 2019-11-12 13:22:23
hyperinflation caused by a future Trumpian president will be the reason why
@_date: 2019-11-07 15:00:09
No, fuck that guy. Hope he loses his private keys.
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:02:40
Miners have little to no control over the price of bitcoin. If there's no demand from the whales/institutions then bitcoin's price is going to remain low. The only thing that will happen is more people will get out of the mining business.

I doubt he's that rich and if he was, then he can afford it.
Fuck asshole billionaires who whine about losing a few % of their ill-gained money.
@_date: 2019-08-28 00:33:54
why just millennials? next recession is going to destroy EVERYONE. and its all thanks to trump lol.
@_date: 2019-08-26 05:20:57
that's a lot of BTC to waste. i would only put 0.0001 on something like this.
@_date: 2019-08-28 00:34:14
bro, do you realize that millennials are in their late 30s now?
@_date: 2019-10-06 01:04:50
Lmao if bitcoin is 1 million USD in 2028 that means that inflation has gotten so bad that the above house is probably worth 500 million.
@_date: 2019-10-04 16:44:48
wait 90,000 by May? yeah not happening lol
@_date: 2019-10-20 17:55:58
Yes I know it's not ideal. It's better to just own bitcoin flat out. But I didn't want to do a withdrawal on my IRA. I figured it was better to just get out of mutual funds that weren't performing well and put it all in GBTC.
@_date: 2019-08-28 00:34:58
won't matter since the planet will be uninhabitable by 2050 since nobody's doing anything about climate change.
@_date: 2019-10-17 23:53:30
this makes no sense. the whales are going to get out of bitcoin and into bonds when there's a recession.
@_date: 2019-10-18 12:22:43
what's happening in Venezuela isn't a recession. it's poor economy management/sanctions that resulted in hyperinflation.
@_date: 2019-10-17 23:54:18
lol hyperinflation in a recession?? how old are you cause it seems you weren't old enough to understand what happened in 2008-2012.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:55:41
don't know but i want an even bigger dip so I can buy in more! 6800 isn't low enough lol
@_date: 2019-10-20 01:18:54
i converted my entire IRA into GBTC. no regrets.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:45:18
BCH could fall at any time since its being pumped. it'd be safer to put your BTC in ETH or something stable.
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:15:19
didn't stay there very long tho.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:07:35
net neutrality is already dead thanks to all of the idiots who voted for trump and yes this does allow ISPs to fuck us over.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:09:37
ISPs are always finding new ways to fuck consumers over every year, with rising costs and new ways to nickel and dime us. We're already seeing it in the way Comcast manhandles their customers. Just because they didn't do it over the last decade doesn't mean they won't come up with ways to do it now, especially since it means more profit for them and consumers can't do shit about it because again, too many fucking idiots voted for Trump.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:42:04
Yeah, I missed the boat on this while my brother moved his BTC to BCH and other altcoins just in time. So I'm just going to hold and start buying back in when BTC hits 4k.
@_date: 2019-09-27 22:57:31
you'd have to be a fucking idiot to not use coinbase
@_date: 2019-09-02 01:51:43
lol most of the entire world will be dead by 2060 or so because we're not doing shit about climate change.
@_date: 2019-09-03 13:37:50
why the fuck not is the better question. where else are we going to buy btc?
@_date: 2019-05-15 12:48:21
I hope you try this, and then your girlfriend just keeps your bitcoin and dumps you lol.
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:55:24
you mean like everyone else?
