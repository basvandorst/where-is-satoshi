It's what bitcoin core developers prefer. They don't want segwit to bloat the blocksize before lightning is ready.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:12:09
MAX block size, combined with target time for difficulty adjustment (i.e. 10 minutes) will absolutely correlate with fees per transaction.
If a block is large, then there is a greater likelihood of available headroom to take additional transactions. Hence the cost of incorporating another transaction (i.e. fee) will be low.
You can spam bitcoin cash but it would be significantly more expensive to do so.
For instance, to 'spam' a Bitcoin core block, you could fill up the whole block by creating 2000 TX of the average size (450 bytes) with a fee of ~$50 each. This would cost about $100,000 per block (i.e. every 10 minutes) although it's likely only about half would be required to significantly impinge legitimate use. So let's say $50k per block. That would cost around $7 million per day.
To spam a Bitcoin Cash Block (assuming equal legitimate background use) would require around 16,000 TX at a cost of $800,000 per block. Let's make the same assumption that only half of this would be required to cause issues, thus $400k per block. I don't know of anyone who has nearly half a million to burn every 10 minutes. That would require around $60 million per day.
Nonetheless, large block sizes do entail some substantial disadvantages in relation to block propagation and full node sync time. However a moderate increase right now (i.e. to 2 MB or 4MB or 8MB like Bitcoin Cash) would probably suffice to relieve fee pressure and restore use cases while retaining the bulk of decentralised properties of Bitcoin.
If you follow bitcoin core developers however, then their opinion is that the 1 MB block size is already too large and that no one should be using SegWit right now as that will bloat the block size above 1 MB.
If I understand core developers correctly, they opine that for now, bitcoin isn't to be used by anyone other than the wealthy to store their capital and SegWit shouldn't be used until LN is ready. That to me is ridiculous. What is the point of Bitcoin Core even existing right now if the people leading it don't actually want people to use it until LN is ready (supposedly sometime in the next year or two)?
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:49:10
Now it is. But during difficulty adjustments and with Bitcoin Cash's old difficulty adjustment mechanism there were times when Bitcoin Cash's hashing power exceeded that of bitcoin core. This happened, for example, on the 23 of August 2017 and on the 12 of November 2017 ([See here](
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:03:07
[Bitcoin core devs have been saying it for months](
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:17:50
Core doesn't want you to use SegWit (as it will bloat the block size). They just needed SegWit as a stepping stone to allow the LN to work.  [They have no solution for high TX fees other than the LN network]( and that technology is not expected to launch until next year (at least). You are doing a disservice to core by promoting use of SegWit right now.

Key bitcoin core developers are advocating NOT to use segwit until lightning is deployed. They've been at the centre of all of this, so if they continue to control the narrative and development they will find ways to make sure people DO NOT use segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:01:28
That makes no sense. Look at Bitcoin Cash, they have larger blocks and on occasion have had more hashing power than bitcoin, yet their fees are comparatively insignificant. Small blocksizes cause high fees since incorporating transactions in a limited space becomes a bidding war. The smaller the blocksize, the harder it is to incorporate a transaction and hence the more valuable it is to achieve it, hence higher fees.

Well you can check my maths for me:
USD: $196.35
BTC received: 0.48245615
BTC to AUD from Coinjar (bid price): 461.82 -1% sell fee = $457.2018/BTC
Total AUD (if I had sold it for it): $220.58 AUD
effective exchange rate USD-&gt;AUD = 1.12
Which compares to google's price (from somewhere) of 1.14 ([Imgur](
so pretty good :)

I asked for an invite around March or just when they started (I think?). But I only received it about 3 weeks ago or so. But if it makes you feel better, I can't buy anymore Bitcoin now through Circle... As I mentioned, I drained my account, and they don't yet accept Australian bank accounts. So it was a one-time use thing for me. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 15:47:13
Yup. But it seems only another party can effect a transfer by charging the account. I could have done the same if I had a card linked to it (last option on my list). But i'd still have the problem of getting the card in the first place.
@_date: 2014-09-27 15:17:25
I've never lived in the states. I was only there for a week or so on my way home (I'm Mexican/Australian). So I had that account opened for flexibility. I was working as a freelancer from Sydney and getting paid was always an issue, so I opened the account to make it easier for myself and the people who contracted me.
@_date: 2014-09-27 15:23:23
Unfortunately no. I tried. They wouldn't accept my Australian card. But it may be because it's a debit one.
@_date: 2014-09-27 15:31:01
oh... then perhaps they can't be sent via mail or something. The representative on the phone dismissed the idea (after putting me on hold and checking) and said it wouldn't work, but he didn't elaborate...

The account was not a checking account. It was a savings account.
edit: Sorry. I think I understand what you mean. The fundamental problem is that I couldn't add any new accounts to link to my savings account in order to do the transfer. And I can't open an account over the phone if I am not a resident. There is an option to transfer to another country using Wells Fargo's remmittances system but then I would have to sign up to this:  and attend a branch in person to do so.

As someone who lives in Australia and had a balance consisting pretty much of only BTC, how do I file a claim? 
@_date: 2014-09-27 17:09:03
Yes. It appears Circle is running a risk here by approving my purchase before clearing my funds. But the reason I thought this would work is because the phone rep actually mentioned that a client can use the routing and account number to charge the account. That's when the idea of using Circle rung in my head. There's a chance the bank won't clear it, in which case I assume I will be hearing from Circle. The BTC is out of their wallet (in my control now) but I want to make sure I do the right thing (and not rip them off).

The bank who manages the account would have various systems in place to flag if it was being 'spammed', and they can freeze the account so that funds bounce from it. And importantly, it would be difficult to obtain Obama's personal bank account details to begin with, which will not be the case with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 03:40:28
This is risky, as the recipient may not be able to distinguish it among other legit transactions, including salary, remittances, etc. When would you know to send it back? And what happens if a government official is spammed by thousands of transactions?
Edit: I guess the software will have to be written to automatically send back ALL transactions unless the incoming sender address was in a list of approves addresses. That's the only fix I can think of.
@_date: 2017-02-23 11:59:35
I understand all that. However, back when I started to receive mining proceeds this wasn't really a problem I foresaw. How do I consolidate them? That involves sending them all to a another address, right? That's what I'm trying to do. But the fee is $70 USD.
@_date: 2014-07-18 08:13:56
I have read a summarised version, and I'm aware that it only regulates businesses managing bitcoins for someone else. Still, the point I'm trying to make is that it would be INCREDIBLY easy to sabotage ANY business by just sending some bitcoins to an address they control. After that, they have to figure out who sent it and where he lives, etc. I could easily find an address owned by bitstamp, or any other bitcoin business and just send some dust over to it. Good luck now, if you get audited you will need to know where it came from. 
We should try to find a regulator with any type of business that is using bitcoin and had activities in new York. Send some bitcoins to it and show them how ridiculous their regulations are (expecting them being able to obtain info about the sender).  If they have some skin in the game they will realise their stupidity.

@_date: 2017-02-23 13:26:36
As per my comment above, I tried to send all with a lower fee (0.01 BTC or about $15 USD) but BC.info won't let me. Even after using the advanced send feature and changing the fee (and amount being sent obviously), the send button gets greyed out until I raise the fee. So, what now? I can't import the ~~wallet~~ address into electrum either because it's not generating the right address from the private key.
Edit: The only way to send the transaction is with BC.Info's high fees (and lose $70 USD). Otherwise I'll be stuck checking every minute of every day for a point when fees are low. I'll then have to quickly log in to BC.Info just to generate the transaction with lower default fees. I work, I can't check this queue all the time.

I have a private key from a very old BC.info account. I imported to electrum and it gives me a totally different address (with 0 balance obviously). WTH? What do I do? I can't even sweep the balance because BC.info's suggested fee is $70 USD.

And why must we move to LN? If we raise the block limit we can have a healthier and cheaper fee market. And stay with bitcoin. 
The only argument is that this will cause centralisation but running nodes is literally the cheapest part of the equation so the decentralisation argument is pretty poor.

I agree this is an important trend, but more likley the devaluation of the Bolivar is why the volume chart (which is in Bolivares) is spiking. So it's not necessarily the case that more bitcoins are being bought or used. 
@_date: 2016-03-04 08:11:01
I used to think that, but I'm no longer confident of it. 
With the current block limit, hashing rate and assuming optimistic miner efficiencies, even using conservative numbers you arrive at about 26kWh required per single bitcoin transaction (from hashing power). EACH ONE.
Check my maths: 
Even in places with cheap or heavily subsidised electricity... At best you'll find a price of about 5 US cents per KWh. So that's $1 USD required to cover the energy per transaction from hashing.  Fees are nowhere near that high, so I assume miners are deriving most of their revenue from the block reward. 
This isn't sustainable. Eventually the block reward will fall too much and Chinese miners may eventually be shut down if people realise that they're stealing electricity or obtaining it heavily subsidised at the expense of society. 
The block limit HAS to rise so that the energy per transaction falls to something more reasonable.  If not, economics will eventually catch up to it. You can't use 26kWh per transaction and not pay for that energy forever. Even in China. 
@_date: 2016-03-06 04:37:24
I am long for bitcoin with what I consider a pretty big stake, and I do not agree that voicing my concerns is an attempt to hurt or try to destroy bitcoin.
It is quite possible that miner costs may already be $1USD per transaction (from significant electricity costs), but this isn't reflected instantly in the fee market because miners take it on the chin and are hoping that the price of bitcoin will rise to cover their losses. At the current BTC price ($400 USD/BTC), hash rate (1.2*10^18 H/s) and transactions per block (1800) the mining network will only remain profitable if a combination of low electricity prices and miner efficiency is met.
[I've plotted this relationship](
* And you can see the calculations for it [here](
* And its plotly chart is [here](
The cheapest rates of power I could find are for [industrial customers in India]( who pay a minimuum of 4.25 Rupees (6 US cents) per kWh. However, those prices are only accessible to large industrial customers and not likely to the small hobby bitcoin miners that contribute to the mining pools. [Other sources]( show that prices are actually a bit higher (8 US cents).
If we assume that, on average, miners pay around 10 US cents per kWh and that the efficiency of their equipment is 1.6 GH/joule (which is only possible if they have equipment such as the the [Spondooliestech SP31 Yukon and AntMinerS5, AntMinerS5+ and AntMinerS7]( then electricity costs per day add up to $1,952,091 USD while the block reward only provides them with about $1,440,000 USD (assuming each bitcoin is $400 USD). This means fees would have to be 72 US cents per transaction for them to make up for the difference and break even.
Since these are not the fees being charged, which is the incorrect assumption? Are miners, on average, obtaining electricity at rates below 0.10/kWh or is the average efficiency of the network higher than 1.6 GH/Joule? Or are a significant portion of them running at a loss?
Come the next halvening, it gets even worse. For miners overall to remain profitable a combination of one or many of the following has to occur:
* A decrease in the price of electricity (unlikely),
* A decrease in the hashing rate,
* An increase in the average efficiency of all mining equipment,
* An increase in the fees per transaction,
* An increase in the number of transactions per block while retaining fee levels (raise block size limit).
In my opinion an increase in the block size limit is an option with small risks and significant benefits (it may also help avoid less full blocks). But whenever this is voiced, there is a bombardment of abuse and very little in the form of an explanation. Centralisation is quickly invoked as SUPER important, but I do not see how...? Running a node is the cheapest part of the equation and current hardware can meet the needs to store even sundry transactions for hundreds of years. Plus there are better ways to incentivise nodes to set up.
And more importantly, the biggest centralisation pressure is not from lack of enthusiasm and challenges in storage capacity and connectivity to set up nodes (which, by the way, could be made even cheaper by bitcoin derivatives like [Storj]( but from the price of electricity! If you want to decentralise bitcoin, then we've better get busy setting up energy cooperatives for cheap power around the world. Otherwise, all miners will eventually reside in places with cheap power and adequate connectivity (this describes China ATM). And they will hold a big sway in any decision.
@_date: 2016-03-06 09:18:09
What about my comment on...


I've heard your arguments before but no one cares to explain. How does the blocksize limit influence attack resistance? Nodes are cheap to run and the community can incentivise there to be more if attacks or censorship become a threat (arguably this is what clas**c is doing).
@_date: 2016-03-13 07:21:20
I agree. And the blocksize limit is not the pressure that is causing mining centralisation. It is electricity costs, connectivity and access to efficient mining technology.
@_date: 2016-03-06 10:58:18
But Hearn explained the reasoning behind the black-listing. Spam attacks where using proxies and tor nodes and so Hearn coded a black list to be invoked only if it detected a spam attack and not by default.
If less nodes is what scares you, then you should be embracing what classic is doing. If anything they have definitely proven that the community can bring the number of nodes up... [they have added around 1,500 of their own \(which are compatible across versions\) in the last month or so]( ([source](

@_date: 2016-03-05 01:34:59
I think the issue is already here. My calculations for the $2,600 electricity costs are using the very conservative assumption that everyone is using the most efficient commercial miner (the AntMiner S7) and that miners are paying 5 US cents per KWh of electricity.
Both of these assumptions are immensely generous to your argument. 
I may do some research later in the day on composition of the mining pool hardware and get a more detailed assessment. However my gut feel is that electricity costs are already near $10,000 which is why miners are threatening to leave.
Edit: another generous assumption is that the hash rate remains flat, which has no historical support. 
@_date: 2016-03-13 07:37:13
True, I did not include a price rise. We could add that to the list, but there are big problems with this, because:
* Arguably, most buyers have already priced in the halvening. 
* The supply of bitcoin wouldn't drop overnight. Only the rate of increase. If accumulation levels remains the same there will be some disproportionate upward price pressure, but this is unlikely to immediately double the price of bitcoins. 
Either way, big swings in price will also cause major problems. Unless the price doubles fairly quickly, miners will immediately feel the pain and many may choose to drop out. This would cause the network hashrate to decrease (potentially very significantly).
If the price then begins to move (up or down), there will be a flood of transactions to get coins to exchanges and cash in/out. However, with a lower hashrate (from miners quitting), blocks will take longer to solve and exacerbate the small block size problem. Combine this with even a small spam attack (or a coordinated drop in hash power) and this could be the event that finally ends all confidence in bitcoin. I don't want that to happen.
Tell me how you discount that.

Pass the bucket much?
I started mining in 2013. Back then Gavin and others were working on roadmaps to increase the blocksize. And these roadmaps were gaining momentum. Then they faltered.
Now, Segwit seems to have the same problem (seems to have good momentum now, but it's faltering).
So, what does the thinking man do to protect against Segwit activation failing? Do you expect people to be able to see into the future?

That's disgusting. And then when people host the nodes on AWS so that they can survive some of the DDOS-ing they get called out for being virtual and not valid. So much for encouraging free thought and an open community. 
@_date: 2016-03-05 00:51:27
What is healthy? It's unsustainable to expect fees to give miners a business model unless you're prepared to have an average fee per transaction of $1 USD (or more if hashing power keeps expanding) to cover electricity costs eventually (once block rewards are too low).
Maybe if mining had remained a philanthropic endeavour (like Wikipedia) and not a business, we wouldn't be having these problems (we'd likely be having other takeover issues though).
Edit: The only other option, and I know many are unwilling to hear it, is: Raising the block limit (and fees a bit too) so that fees can be spread amongst a higher number of transactions. But this also requires Bitcoin use to grow SUBSTANTIALLY. E.g. if there were 10 times as many transactions per block (e.g. about 20,000) then the average fee to cover electricity costs per transaction would only have to be around 10 US Cents.
@_date: 2016-03-05 01:05:20
Yes, but I just explained how this isn't sustainable. Right now, successful mining pools derive an average of $10,000 USD from each block reward. But the network spends about $2,600 in electricity from hashing to obtain that. After the halving, if we stay at these prices, then the reward will drop to $5,000 while electricity costs could remain about the same. With the next halvening after that, assuming hashing power remains the same, the miners will need to get all their profit from fees... I don't see that happening unless fees rise substantially or there are more transactions per block.
@_date: 2016-03-07 07:00:24
Whatever it is, it goes to show that the community can mobilise to increase node count with incentives (in this case the incentive is to support classic). So fears that the number of nodes would diminish and be a risk to decentralisation and censorship are unfounded. If either of these things begin to happen, all sides of the community would wake up and add nodes.
@_date: 2016-06-14 22:26:44
This advice is incredibly irresponsible. Without knowledge of cold storage or the risk of many online wallets, dodgy exchanges, lacklustre security or failing to properly backup your wallets, you could very well lose all your wealth if you moved it all to bitcoin and don't know what you're doing. Not to mention that there are still scenarios that could wildly affect bitcoin's valuation. 
Bitcoin is meant to provide a robust store of value but it is still to be tested on whether it can achieve this over the long term.
It's definately a good idea to seize some opportunity today, but encouraging newcomers to go all in is irresponsible. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:23:52
Tx fees won't let you tumble dust amounts. Maybe transfer them to a betting site that lets you play against other users. Send your bitcoins to different user accounts in this site. Then play each account until you lose them all against one of your other accounts.
Then withdraw it all from that account.
There's a lot of risky betting sites so I'm not sure if it's worth the time and trouble.
Edit: alternatively, some sites may give you different deposit addresses every time you deposit and have lacklustre KYC rules. If that's the case just amalgamate them there and then withdraw.
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:29:16
No, difficulty is adjusted every two weeks or so to ensure blocks are found around every 10 minutes. If difficulty rose, it's because added hashing power was causing blocks to be found faster than 10 minutes on average.

People don't give a fuck of bigger blocks? I do. I've had to pay fees of $10-$30 to expedite important transactions and they still didn't even make the next block sometimes. The few transactions I've done with Bitcoin Cash had tiny fees and were all incorporated in the next immediate block.

Your graphics card, no matter how advanced, is utterly insignificant compared to the hashing power of modern ASIC miners. You will never make your money back by mining bitcoin with it. This has been the case for years already. The difficulty was waaaay too high for graphics cards 5 years ago. It's not even worth considering today.
Maybe try other cryptos with different hashing algorithms which cannot be brute forced with ASICs

At this point bitcoin really has to prove it can hold its community together. I believe a small compromise in the vein of the other camp's proposal would have benefited the network far more than just reaping the technological benefits from solely implementing segwit.

Yes, obviously the peso is also at an-all time low. What's interesting is that the price of bitcoin in MXN has surpassed the all time high that was previously established back in December 2014, when 1 BTC = $1163 USD. This is mostly due to the fall of the peso. But this, combined with Bitcoin's own rise against the USD compound to establish a new ATH. So, for Mexicans, investing in bitcoin at any point in its history up to today would have been wise.

The next best mining hardware is the S7, which consumes 2.5X as much power as the S9, and the third best is the S5+ which consumes 4.6X as much (see chat [here]( Source [here]( But it's also unrealistic to assume the mining fleet is composed of only Antminer hardware. If just 30% of the fleet is made up of the Spondooliestech SP31 Yukon miner (the next best non-Antminer hardware) then the electricity consumption from that alone will equate to 8.5 GWh per day or about 3 TWh per year. And that's just 30%. However, we need more information about the miner fleet in major bitcoin farms to determine anything with certainty.

I don't think you understand the scale of the mathematical problem you have to solve in order to get the reward.
Even with an intel i7 processor (one of the newest) you could only do about 50 million hashes per second.
So, best case scenario, you have: 50,000,000 hashes per second. 
The collective hashrate of other miners is around 8 Million Terahashes per second... or
8,000,000,000,000,000,000 hashes per second
So your chances of finding any solution are less than 1 in 160 billion. That's worse than most lotteries.
Also, you can't just download any 1 MB. You have to get 1 MB worth of transactions from the network and then find the correct solution (the right NONCE) to create a new identifying hash.
You are just going to waste money on electricity. Join a mining pool or invest the money in buying bitcoin itself. Don't mine it.

And therein the end of bitcoin for use by many businesses that accept it for 'petty cash' purchases.
And you may very well be correct in how this will turn out. But it astounds me that you do not realise how this goes against what was initially campaigned.
According to you, these businesses should have never accepted bitcoin to begin with. So, should they have waited for an, as of yet nonexistent, side-chain technology to validate their use case?
I've campaigned for bitcoin endlessly, through price swings and talks of money laundering and even after losing money on MtGox. But it's hard to keep this up when the promises keep falling away and being told "No, that's not what bitcoin is for" by those who seem to be peddling ideas backed by a private company.

[I'm looking at the stats]( that posted. These show that for block 2 confirmation an average of 110,000 satoshis are now required. That equates to about 40 US cents. If my interpretation is wrong, then what is it telling us?
Edit: looking at it closely, I can see that the chart is per kB. So what is the average size of a transaction (in kB)?
Edit 2: [With an average transaction size of 250 bytes]( the suggested fee would be about 12 cents. This destroys the specific example (a cent) that Wences Casares talked about in the video. That may not be catastrophic yet. But how far will the fees grow?
@_date: 2016-02-27 23:28:05
That trend is immensely disappointing. We now need fees of up to 0.001 BTC for block 2 confirmations?
We're throwing away a use case of bitcoin that was promised to many (like buying a coffee with it). The solutions being put forward by core developers are partisan and involve third party developed networks that are prone to control and political influence ([Blockstream's involvment in the Lightning Protocol](
One video that always resonates with me is an interview with Wences Casares back in 2014. Before all this politicking and Blockstream drama the promise was that Bitcoin would permit swift transport of the tiniest of values, even to the poorest (see from 6:14, but then watch it all, he explains the usefulness of bitcoin very well):
That use case is dead now, unless a third party sidechain company saves us. Through their influence, Blockstream has created a problem and set themselves as the only ones who can fix it. And then all this censoring in this sub to even address this? Are people in not disappointed by this?
Edit: 0.001 BTC not 0.1 BTC
Edit 2: Blockstream's involvement in the Lightning Network
@_date: 2016-02-28 11:15:48
No one is saying bitcoin has to be ready to take millions of microransactions per day today. But adoption shouldn't be hindered with an artificial limit that isn't even relevant to the limits of the network now. 
They didn't stop working on the internet in the 90s even though no one really believed that it would eventually handle on-demand HD video delivery to every household. 
Raising the limit now won't fix the problems of the future. But it will fix the immediate problem of potentially catastrophic loss of confidence from those who stand to gain most from bitcoin today.
@_date: 2016-02-28 08:58:31
My point still stands. Arguably the places where Bitcoin holds the greatest practical utility are being priced out.
[The black market price of USD in bolivars in Venezuela is now around 1,000 bolivars per USD.](
A cup of coffee in Caracas costs 40 bolivars, or 0.04 USD (4 cents).


([Source]( 
So a Venezuelan would pay a 100% transaction fee to buy a cup of coffee.
Venezuelans have the greatest incentives to move out of the bolivar into a currency that the government cannot control and that can hold its value. But if buying a cup of coffee with it will equate to a 100% transaction fee, it will never take off.
The people who need bitcoin the most and have the potential to really propel the benefits and adoption of the currency are being priced out.
But whatever, right? Doesn't break *your* bank.

Brushing your derisive comment aside, carbon emissions, or more importantly energy use, is a an argument that falls strongly against you in this case. 
The energy use of bitcoin is significantly dominated by the hashing power of the network, not by the power demands of storage. At the moment using even the most conservative assumptions (and the most efficient commercial miner, the AntMiner S7), the energy used for hashing per transaction is about 26 kWh. Assuming you can somehow obtain this energy at a retail rate of 5 US cents per kWh (unlikely in the developed world), the cost per transaction is over 1 USD. The fact that miners exist with fees that are lower than this is an indication that miners are obtaining subsidised electricity at the expense of the rest of society. This is one of the reasons why you only see big miners in China. No one else can obtain electricity at such reduced rates. 
On the other hand, the energy expended to keep the storage capacity of the roughly 6500 nodes going is minuscule. Assuming an average power draw of 50 watts per 4TB external hard disk, the energy use per transaction for the storage component is around 0.03 kWh, or about 0.001 USD (a tenth of a single cent). 
The block size limit has a linear relation to the energy required per transaction from hashing. And since hashing power represents 99.9% of the energy demand for the bitcoin network, doubling the block size limit will essentially halve the required energy per transaction.
So if you're going to bring in energy and emissions, the figures are heavily stacked against you on this one. 
Check my maths:

That's a bit worrying. If this same 30% withdraws right after the halvening...and others withdraw naturally due to low reward... We could see long periods of terribly full blocks before the next difficulty adjustment.

It could cause a backlog of two weeks until the next difficulty adjustment. That would scare many and move the price, which in turn would prompt others to move their coins into or out of an exchange and exacerbate the backlog.

On the other hand, someone could be preparing a humongous short of bitcoin. 
* Step 1: add enormous amounts of hashing power under your control 
* Step 2: Add a short position of hundreds or thousands of bitcoins 
* Step 3: wait for the halving 
* Step 4: remove your hashing power and cause confirmation times to sky-rocket 
* Step 5: watch the market go nuts for almost two weeks. 
* Step 6: just before difficulty is re adjusted, close your position. 
* Step 7: Sea of profit. 
* Step 8: re enable your hashing power if it makes sense.

Perhaps. But if it's enough to shake the confidence of a few institutional investors (whales) the price may move down strongly and affect all of us. Then couple that with the fact that this will be the best time to coordinate another spam attack and combine it with sabotaging or deliberately removing hashing power. With very little resources you could cause havoc.

He has no idea what he is talking about. The whole reason net neutrality is required is ***because*** corporations were beginning to enact control over what we could see and how fast (e.g. Verizon throttling Netflix traffic). His argument basically amounts to "Government and regulations are bad so don't let them control the internet."
Well, my thoughts are that letting the internet be controlled by monopolies like Comcast and Verizon has proven to be far worse. **There is a problem** (Verizon throttling Netflix showed us that). And the solution the U.S. has applied is to reclassify broadband as Title II. I agree with this solution.

1. I hadn't heard of you before you posted this 
2. The thing I love the best is that you can sell for no fees and that your services are available to Australians. I also like that it seems that the seller's price reflects the actual market price 
3. I dislike that your site does not immediately make it clear in what countries your service is available (at least in the mobile version). I also dislike that you don't support AUD as the currency for selling (even though you support Australian banks). This makes me wonder how much I'll be paying in currency conversion fees/margin.

The energy requirements to operate the bitcoin network are dominated by the power requirements of hashing, not the storage of information. While it seems that storing the information is a big deal, in reality it isn't, in comparison to the humongous energy use of miners.
When I did my calculations (based on the number of nodes and even using worse case scenario assumptions of energy use from hard disks), the energy from storage represents at most 2% of the energy required per transaction. 98% of it is from hashing power. 
Due to the limited block size (but substantial power use of miners), if you run the calculations even using optimistic efficiency figures you will find that each transaction requires more than 20 kWh of energy to be committed. That is utterly unsustainable. If the block size was doubled, the energy requirements from having to store the blockchain would increase only very very slightly. But the energy requirements per transaction would decrease by half (twice as many transactions per hashing power). Storage is cheap. Hashing isn't.
@_date: 2016-05-21 11:31:23
Wait till the halving. If bitcoin doesn't rise in price astronomically then miners will be out of pocket to the tune of about $1USD per transaction. Edit: [or more.](
