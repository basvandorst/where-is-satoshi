Some believe timely is a year or more.  Bitcoin has been delivering for 8 years.  The second most popular coin etherium has been delivering for 2 years.  If you want to see potential in something younger than that you might be right but your results may vary.

You need a way to 'earn' coins.  Otherwise they have no value.  By giving coins to miners for mining you have a natural way to reward contributors to the network.  You could do something similar with smart contracts but then you need some system to decide what thing of value someone contributed for those coins.

The customers cryptographic key.  The customer signed the transaction when they took the groceries.  It is like a signature for a credit card but secure, not alterable, and includes the currency exchanged.  The grocery store now has currency that can be moved to the blockchain or used in the lightning network.  The cashier can not take it because it was not to their wallet.
What holds them accountable is bitcoin opens the channel, the coin is locked until the channel closes, and signing all transactions in the channel.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:37:14
How divisible are bitcoins?
A bitcoin can be divided down to 8 decimal places. Therefore, 0.00000001 BTC is the smallest amount that can be handled in a transaction. If necessary, the protocol and related software can be modified to handle even smaller amounts.
That is a heck of a lot of coin.

A store of wealth is not a currency.  It is an asset class similar to gold.  Gold has value and you do not use it to buy goods and services.
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:36:24
The relative value of the two currencies are not a good comparison.  What matters for bitcoin to 'grow up' is market cap and liquidity.  Without both of those growing higher the grand experiment could fail.  You get the first with more assets joining but you only get the second if not everyone is holding.

The purpose has not changed.  The current problems as a currency are being corrected and tested.  It will not be fixed overnight.  All coins that uses proof of work will have the same problems even with larger block sizes.
Many who are not developing solutions are happy to use it as an asset class for now.  Other are not and are experimenting with new coins or bandaid solutions.

It would also create overload as everyone tried to get on at the same time.  Maybe that is their fault for not having capacity.  But they are hated if they do not offer a way to get hard forked BCH sooner and hated if they do and not announce it ahead of time.

It is still deflationary.  As planned ether will mint nearer to nearer no new coins.

I would like to mention that the bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market has rarely been stable.  It is wild wild west for another few years or more if things go wrong.  What gives stability is more players like more exchanges.  Keeping coinbase around but checked by other exchanges is important.
Hopefully Gemini works with more currencies and assets as you said.  I believe the brothers are invested mentally and financially in bitcoin and ether and that their exchange will have bias to bitcoin and ether.  I doubt bitcoin cash will appear there soon.

Exchanges go down.  If there is sudden volatility that you want to trade against you can not be sure the one exchange you picked will be available.  Having two or more exchanges to be able to trade makes sense to me.
If you are saying holding value long term on exchange is bad then you are right in my opinion.

You are not wrong.  Side chains and alt coins is my guess as to what will allow that level of transaction.

There has been only one serious flash crash (correct me please if I am wrong) in bitcoin.  A lot of people lost a lot of money with stop losses, only to see the market flash back up, leaving them with much less.
My suggestion, do not play at being a daytrader.  Evaluate a coin for its long term worth.  Play the long game.  Unless you are really a day trader with years of experience.

Remember that bitcoin has scaling problems and it's unlikely to change much because of its size and momentum to quickly fix those problems.  This leaves room for other coins and networks on bitcoin to grow.  It is possible there will be many popular crypto currencies and networks in the future.

If $200 is small compared to your income then do not worry about it.  If it is large compared to your income then switch to a wallet you control and not a 3rd party.
Be warned some in this community have been burned by 3rd parties stealing their coins (see Mt Gox) so the default answer is to move to your own wallet.  Not bad advice but not necessary if it is not a lot of money for you.

The ether network is bigger than one person now.  If you go watch his recent speech he calls out the inability of the ether network to do a future correction DOA fork.  It is no longer a one person show.  Strong guidance, strong vision, strong community, strong stability....pick two of those.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:03:27
Lightning is not 'off the record'.  It is aggregating transactions.  It is cryptographically secure.  An analogy is buying groceries in cash.  The grocery store collects all the cash for the day (Lightning).  Then they deposit cash in the bank that evening (Bitcoin Blockchain).
Also, a blockchain size increase does not fix the transaction problem that bitcoin and forks have.  It is limited to every ten minutes.  Lightning is less than a second.  Fees are not the only problem that is being solved.

Go to coinbase.com.  Easiest and safest way to start.  Fees are high.  But that doesn't matter when you are first getting started. They are FDIC insured.

Bitcoin Cash is faster because it has a bigger block size and also has a lower transaction fee.  But the problem is that it is a step in the wrong direction.  When you double the block size you double the blockchain size which makes a distributed network that much more expensive.  The blockchain is already 153GB per whole client.  So yes it is an incremental improvement but it is a short term one that actually makes the mid to far term problem worse.
Bitcoin is working to solve this problem the 'correct' way and has some solutions on the horizon.  Actually when it will arrive is a guess; hopefully before a wave of post early adopters.
I would recommend against bitcoin cash.  There are other coins which believe they have solved or partially solved this problem.  If you are looking for a coin today which solves some of bitcoins problems today I would recommend something like litecoin or ether/etherium to name some popular ones.  They both have healthier communities than bitcoin cash.  There are also many many other crypto curriences that I would not recommend until you no longer consider yourself new at it.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:34:32
I am reluctant to call it a pure scam since I think a lot of people who are not part of the unsavory elements bought into it.  But I can without a doubt say it's not the right solution as is, unlikely to work long term, and does not have a healthy community.  And I would highly recommend staying away from it when there are better alternatives for new people.  If you like to play markets and are good at estimating peaks and dips then there is some opportunity there but it is very risky and given it's current value probably well past that point. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:29:42

Blockstream does have (pending?) patents.  I suggest you and others read their [faq]( on it.  It is much the same reason Google bought Motorola for the patent defense war.

Mining is a bad idea if the coin supports ASIC (dedicated processors) mining as an option.  You will pay more for electricity than you make unless you have a datacenter and live in Iceland or next to a hydro dam.  Very large mining farms have turned this into a margin business.
Also do not use Cloud mining services.
If you really want to mine; find a coin (not bitcoin at the moment) that forces cpu or gpu only mining.  You might make a profit there.

1) Yes, unless the device supports passphrases.
2) Depends on the wallet.
3) You do not.  You have to trust the hardware wallet manufacturer.  Do not buy hardware wallets from third parties like amazon.  Consider buying more than one hardware wallet from different vendors.
4) With a passphrase the hardware wallet is almost unbreakable.  You can recover using the seed and your passphrase and then invalidate the wallet.
5) Give them your passphrase and seed.  If you loss both it is not recovereable.
6) Depends on the wallet.
7) A 'paper' wallet etched in steel in a bomb proof vault or security box is about as safe as you can get.  If you trust the people selling you the security box.

It depends on how much risk you are willing to accept and how much money/asset you are storing on the device.  Is it less than a small percentage of your yearly income?  I would not worry about it.  You are more secure than most other people.  Third party hacking these devices is hard.
Is it close to your life savings (which you should not do)?  Did bitcoin just climb to $1mill a coin?  I would suggest splitting some of it into a paper wallet.  Or if you can still return it, buy the device directly from the manufacturer.

My understanding is that the Coinbase dashboard lags behind the exchange for two reasons.  One is that the script for the dashboard only polls the price a few times a minute where the gdax dashboard is updated many times in that time.  And the second is that the coinbase purchase price is always a little higher or lagged behind the exchange.  For example, try clicking buy on the coinbase dashboard you will probably get a price that is not the same as what is on the coinbase dashboard.
I suspect the gdax pricing especially on limit orders is the most up to date consensus price you can get.  Note, different exchanges have at any one moment different prices.  They are generally close to each other but not always.

It is not know to happen (minus one incident that I know of that was patched).  The hardware wallet takes precautions to prevent it.  It is mostly extra caution.  
But all hardware given physical access is hackable.  And if it's the same price why would you let a 3rd party handle your wallet?

It is a form of parallel processing.  Do you argue that more CPU/GPU/ASICus to not get it done faster?
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:30:58
Solid advice.
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:08:09
There is only one hack that I am aware of.

Your welcome!
It's not a bad idea to have more than one wallet.  Like two hardware or electronic wallets.

A full node has downloaded and stored the entire bitcoin blockchain history which is currently about 153GB.  A full node is able to run hashes to validate the work of the miners and transmit the results to other nodes.

Thank you!

I would suggest you create a GDAX account.  It's free and owned by the same company as Coinbase.  It even can use the same login.  You don't have to trade on it.  You can use it simply to visualize what is happening in near real time.
If you do decide to use GDAX to trade, make sure you understand it first.  But using it to view without having to refresh coinbase is useful as a first step.

No, if side chains work.

It just burst, less than $6k now, and majority of the 0.01 transactions went away.

I only briefly looked at greenaddress.  That one of their value adds is 2 factor authentication when that should be required is bad.  I am not an expert on greenaddress.  I would like to be proven wrong.  They are in Malta which is interesting.
In short, when someone else has your keys they have your money.  Do you trust them?

I appreciate the offer.  I doubt I'll be mining any time soon but thank you.

I would really like guides for those of you who are on other exchanges.  (Venezuela, NK, China, etc)
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:32:51
ah, ty for that.

I believe that is true.  Options as I see them on GDAX are Bank Account (ACH transfer, free), Bank Wire (not free, and expensive depnding on your bank), Free transaction to and from your coinbase account, and Wallet Transfers to external wallets (free).
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:43:47
This makes a lot of sense.  I would be really interested in how the prices diverge from exchange to exchange (closed room from closed room) if you have any links?
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:19:19
Can you explain more about the ISO's country code policy?
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:27:11
It did.  It was surprising.  TY

I am sincerely curious who all the bitcoin cash developers are.  Can you point me to a repo or online presence that names them?  I would like to evaluate it more.
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:20:11
Unfortunately you will have to navigate the less easy paths.  Good luck!  Perhaps let us know if you found a good one?

This is a really good point.  I dug deeper.  Short story, FDIC insurance only covers your fiat USD Wallet.  They have separate insurance for bitcoins.  It is not clear how much that is.  I will edit the guide.
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:06:58
Many people's experiences with different exchanges are varied.
What I suggest is that for most people, coinbase is the easiest for new users.  However coinbase is expensive compared to other options.  Take a look at my [expanded guide]( for other options.

Can you explain this some more?  So BTC transfers are disallowed in certain zones but ETH is?

Redundancy has rarely led to manipulation (unless you are proposing a feedback loop).  It usually means stability.

Do you view btc as an asset class or a currency?
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:57:40
This depends on if you believe in the long term future of bitcoin.  If you do; it will do nothing but grow in value.  If you don't then you are speculating and need to watch it continuously.  I personally believe some crypto currencies have a long term future.  I am unsure which ones are it.  However I doubt the big players will change in 16 weeks.  Maybe only spend half of that spare money on bitcoin instead of all of it?
