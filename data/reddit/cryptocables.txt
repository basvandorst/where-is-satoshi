Here is a bonus thread of [Version 1 Bitcoin Neon's from around the globe!]( You guys are truly amazing!
@_date: 2014-02-09 21:58:39
We actually have one of those that will ship out Friday as well [here]( - the base will be black :) Though, its acrylic, and not neon. Tubes are only so big!
@_date: 2014-02-10 03:18:19
The sign is made so that you're able to easily disconnect the words and letters from the metal stand. You're welcome to remove them and change the design to your personal preference! However, they are all hand made and packed/shipped ready to go, so we aren't able to make that adjustment for you and will need to make accommodations or DIY :)
@_date: 2014-02-09 23:41:40
Great question! Version 1 did not include the word "Bitcoin" in neon on top. Neon, the parts, and labor are very expensive. It was the most popular request to adjust for V1 that has now been included with V2. All things come with check and balances! Still, we barely make profit due to the cost of production here in the USA on these. They are purely for the benefit of the community. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 23:49:55
Yw! Thank you! :)
@_date: 2014-01-23 12:07:21
Looks great, love the orange color design! [We had some made too :)]( Want to [trade]( for a couple? :D If interested please PM me!
@_date: 2014-02-10 03:21:54
@_date: 2014-02-09 22:26:22
Sweet, thanks for your support! :D Please send us photos if you can! We'd love to add it to the photo album :)
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:34:44
We have [Bitcoin Neon signs]( if that tickles your fancy :)
@_date: 2014-01-07 22:08:25
@_date: 2014-01-27 02:01:42
They are injected moulds, so no, the original does not have a spot for a QR code. That would require a code or custom silkscreen for each bracelet which is way too much work to consider on an individual basis.
@_date: 2014-06-20 22:13:03
Well that's cool... I guess? Resistors are placed in different spots. So.. awkward. o_o
@_date: 2014-01-16 04:04:23
All of the advice in this thread is really good. I'd just like to add, if you're looking to stand out some more, I've designed some [Bitcoin Neon Signs]( for the exact purpose of retailers and restaurants :) If you're interested, please [give us a look]( feel free to let me konw!
@_date: 2014-02-09 22:28:23
Should be a physical coin, but alas not for this picture, sorry :D!
@_date: 2014-02-08 01:46:46
Ironic, isn't it? All in good hands with us, though. It's the carriers we worry about! :D
@_date: 2014-04-17 06:41:55
All you need to do is plug it in. The only thing that changes is there would be less power used :)

Assuming the video file isnt overwritten, you can pull a cache of the youtube video from Uses/user/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User Data/Default/Cache on Windows
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:52:35
Because it's a noun, and happens to be the name of the protocol. :D
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:34:55
This bothers me way more than it should when people spell "Bitcoin" BitCoin. There is no capital C, damnit. No capital C in Litecoin either. The annoying level is like old people on ebay capitalizing every letter in their auctions. It's not necessary. ARGH. And people won't stop. It's going to catch onto the older generation like the plague and I'll be forever damned watching the 40+ group spell it with capital C in the middle. ;_;
@_date: 2014-02-09 10:30:41
Thanks stranger! :D
@_date: 2014-04-17 01:11:53
You had me there for a second. :P
@_date: 2014-04-17 06:28:46
Nope, but Neons are very forgiving and you can remove parts that you don't like if you want to. This is how they get repaired as all pieces are separate.
@_date: 2014-01-27 02:06:11
Maybe down the line. I had plans to do something similar, however, they would be a bit bulky, involve velcro, and not be lightweight and as portable. Basically requires etching on an epilogue laser printer and the metal plates typically aren't very comfortable. The weight comfort is the big factor here.
@_date: 2014-04-25 20:41:15
I still have not received a sample magazine from you guys that was promised multiple times. :(
@_date: 2014-04-16 20:35:23
Hi Reddit, thanks again for being awesome. If you'd like to pick up a sign, you can grab one [here]( A few notes about this particular sign, this is our last batch we are producing for 2014. There's a lot of life on schedule so once these run out you probably won't see them again until Q1 2015. For the LTC Neons, sorry, those are no longer available as I tried to get a big organization [in this thread]( a while back, but only a few accepted. Please let me know if you have any questions! Thanks again :D
Edit: Oh lordy. Totally not necessary but thanks for the gold kind stranger!
@_date: 2017-01-20 01:48:26
Yep! I'm around.. just super busy! :D
@_date: 2013-11-06 00:40:57
I'm excited to see this! Thanks so much for posting! Yeah! :)
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:13:49
A lot of people who own these took a risk a few months ago not actually knowing if the product would come through or not. If they do appreciate in value, they deserve it for their contribution they made towards the project as a whole being a success :)
@_date: 2013-06-20 21:24:21
@_date: 2013-10-24 03:28:42
Just got around to double checking. [It's actually 65.5]( since we swapped over to the new transformer!
@_date: 2013-10-24 19:30:36
Awesome, feel free to emai or PMl me if you have any questions
@_date: 2013-10-24 04:14:50
Fantastic! :D
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:46:37
Thank you! :D
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:59:20
Maybe in the future, but it's not currently on the grid right now. [We have a smaller desk version]( but it is less essentric and not neon, moreso catered towards host stands and register displays.
@_date: 2013-10-24 19:49:27
Tell her it's magical!
@_date: 2013-10-24 02:51:06
~~150w~~ 65watts
I just double checked, I seemed to have been recalling the old transformer model, but we got a new one. :)
@_date: 2013-06-19 22:19:05
Awesome, thank you!

Thank you all for your value input. By popular demand (by a landslide), I am going to go ahead and get v2 produced as a first edition run. Additionally, I will be taking 's advice and will produce another run at another time to cater to hobby gurus around the globe. 
Here is a [preview]( of the final rendition of v2 including all proper gaps and spacing. It is really easy on the eyes, and thank you for your advice!
@_date: 2013-10-24 07:37:00

What horror stories? WP is not the most secure thing in the world but if you install and make sure your security (.htaccess) a top priority its fine. Theres a ton of tutorials online from many users to make it as painless and seamless as possible. As some users have also said, Shopify is as easy as it gets and then you don't have to worry about that. I hate yahoo. lol. damnit yahoo. Everytime I think of that company I think of 1993 websites.
@_date: 2013-10-24 19:35:34
@_date: 2013-10-24 07:30:00
Depending on how popular these get we are looking into considering those for a later time. It's really hard to say at this point what is going to happen as these are brand spankin' new and we need to gauge the interest of these first before moving onto the new project. I know it's not very helpful but its the best I got for you. So short answer, probably not, but maybe. Hope this helps. :P
@_date: 2013-06-19 21:55:27


The only issue I may run into is the price of international shipping due to the weight, which may be killer. I will need to look into alternatives to get around this those who are not in the US :)
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:49:41
Hi guys! If you have any photos, please post in this thread! I would be so honored to add this to our album of shiny awesomeness! :) Additionally, the [Bitcon Neon Sign]( page has been updated to reflect version 2 that will be released in January! The price will be increasing to $325 due to the extra letters on the top, but you are able to lock in a discounted price until then, thank you! :)
Also, please check out [our packing photos]( which will be even more secure, believe it or not! If you're a cat owner.. well, they will love the extra peanuts that will be included. :)

Hi sonetica!
Thanks for your interest! Visit my webshop by [clicking here]( for pricing for the sign and shipping. If you have any questions feel free to ask!
@_date: 2013-06-19 20:20:01
**Why did you decide to make these signs?**
Being from New York City, I am surrounded by all of the colors of the spectrum. For me, this was a no brainer, and I decided shops deserve to have the bit of flair they deserve. While the traction with BTC used to be slow, these days everything has changed. More people are buying, selling, adopting, and converting their storefronts to accept BTC at their locations. It is huge, and there is no obvious way other than stickers that shout out "HEY! WE ACCEPT BTC!". 
**So why are you posting here?**
I came up with a few designs, and I am looking for community input on which design they prefer most. These signs are made for indoor use and will last a lifetime. As an artist, we can be our own worst critic, and do need another pair of eyes from time to time. This is where you come in.
**Who am I?**
I've been running a small shop called [Cryptocables]( for a little while now. This webshop primarily deals with selling powered PCI-E Risers to those who seek them for their rigs. I have been in Cryptocurrency for a little over 2 years now, and I have been producing items with manufacturers for over 3.
Aside from running Cryptocables on the side, I have been with multiple companies over the past 10 years including, but not limited to Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. Over the years I have always been taught to under promise, and over deliver. I strive for the best Customer Service that I can provide on a personal level, and it is my goal to assist in any way I possibly can. 
**Have you found a manufacturer yet?**
Yes. I have located a local, reliable fellow with proper credentials, certificates, amazing business credibility, and completed assessments. He is ready to produce for me as soon as I give him the word on a final design.
**What will they cost?**
At this current moment, each Neon sign will run around 1BTC. This is subject to change in the future, and all shipping information is not accounted for in this estimate. However, this does includes protective packaging which will make global shipping a lot less risky.
**What are the specifications?**
Each sign will run at around 150watts, and will have a UL listed plug. Each sign is mounted and will have areas to either screw in the wall, or be hung with a chain.
**How many will you be making?**
I plan on making different versions of BTC merchandise over the upcoming years. It is not set in stone as to how many are being made, however, if you are interested in one of these for your storefront, mining room, or hobby area - please respond to this thread and the poll!
**Will you accept Pre-Order funds?**
No, not at this time. I will post a working prototype as soon as the design is confirmed, and received. I don't like accepting money for something I do not currently have in hand. I will have a working prototype as soon as the design is confirmed a few days later.
**So.. what do you need from me?**
The last and final step to this is to finalize on one of the above designs. This is where you come in.
**How can I reach you if I have questions**
You can PM me directly on this forum, reach me on IRC, or respond directly to this thread. 
**You made it down this far? Awesome! I would highly appreciate it if you would take the time to speak for which design you love the most. Thank you, and don't forget that you rock!** 
@_date: 2013-07-06 11:29:28
Looked into that, just didn't have the same epic effect that neon signs give off in the real world store fronts. I wanted it to look and have the best visual appearance so it encourages those to ask questions. I thought I could get away with doing it in El wire or LEDs, but I realized soon afterwards theres a reason why all bars and stores have Neon instead. It's just 1000x better. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 03:54:34
Hello, thanks for contacting us, via email, and feeling the need to make a thread here. Don't worry, its okay!
When you pay out via Bitpay, you have X amount of minutes to complete your checkout. If payment is not sent properly to the address listed in the Bitpay window, it will not be counted as a successful transaction. If coins are sent in that amount of time after the window has already passed, customers need to contact Bitpay in order to get a refund from them as they will not be forwarded to us after that point in time. This is a standard procedure, as merchants don't have access to Bitpays hotwallet that stores funds and transfers them.
Merchants do not have access to any unsuccessful attempts made to our account. We can see successful ones and credit due to each order, but unsuccessful ones are not present. This is where Bitpay support comes in to retrieve your coins for you.
We ship hundred of packages a day and  have many people paying with coins, including LTC. I'm sorry you've run into this issue, however, if you send this over to the Bitpay team I'm sure they'll be glad to look into this and investigate for you.
To help serve, you we will additionally be sending an email to them in regards to this order and will send you any updates that we have in regards to this payment.
Have a great Bitday!
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:06:59
Might be a consideration for the future!
@_date: 2013-11-15 23:55:03
I will get feedback for v2 and see how it goes the next turn around. Thanks for your input!
@_date: 2013-10-24 04:15:08
Woot! I will get it out as soon as everything clears! THANK YOU! :D
@_date: 2013-10-08 01:56:05
Glad to see the update, Sean! Keep up the great work!
On that note, we just got our BTC Neon signs in and we are looking to get one over to you. Can you contact me via PM here so I can send one your way? Free of charge, this one is on us. I have tried to message you directly but haven't had any luck in a response, probably due to the swarm of message you get. :) -crypt0queen
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:22:53
Just sent you a PM asking for some details. Get back to me so we can work something out, we love the BTC community :) -crypt0queen

This is something to highly consider. I may do this.
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:17:01
I'm able to produce in bulk if requested. It is an open invitation to please contact me directly if you're interested in a bulk (25+) order. :)
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:50:28
We're doing well. The biggest challenge is shipping internationally outside of NA and overseas due to high shipping cost. We will be moving forward to rectify this issue by working with Shipwire in Europe/Australia in the future. However, its really easy and straightforward to do in the USA/Canada, etc.
@_date: 2013-12-14 04:12:18
No problem, we're more than happy to help get this sorted out. Believe it or not, this type of thing happens all the time. Sorry for any of the trouble! I'll be sure to throw in an extra bracelet for your trouble and inconvenience. Hopefully this will be sorted out soon -- just don't let this one transaction be a downer, it happens!
Happy Holidays!

Some members of my family run a small online e-commerce with Shopify and dont want to switch to anything else. They are "technology challenged" and like the Shopify UI. Any ETA for the Shopify app for them to use? It's been in progress for a while, and they want to accept bitcoins but don't know when it will be available.
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:45:09
I think he meant, since you laminated it, how are you going to open it without destroying the paper -- since, you know melting and stuff. :)
@_date: 2013-06-19 21:11:48
I wish the comments were working! /sadface!
@_date: 2013-06-20 04:05:10
I will be taking them after I have a fully working and functional design that I can show the final product to :) I don't like offering a Pre-Order based on concept only.
@_date: 2013-06-09 19:05:30
Basically, this "story" is bullshit, and I will tell you why. From the investigation of other members and I, here is the following information.
* Look how long the currently LTC Block is. With that in mind:
* His round share is only .003ltc, yet he is getting 29,000 kh/sec. The numbers do not add up.
* Only 90171 paid shares? Haha, okay. Next.
* Nobody has ever seen this guy on the site before, and there are plenty of very active members always adding new machines to our account on a consistant basis.. With 29,000 worth of hash power I think at least I or another active member would have noticed him.
* According to the logs, he enters IRC but probably leaves shortly after, and then changes his nick: funoriam is now known as shgn. 
* serraz doesn't even talk like that in IRC. Additionally, he has a very specific type of verbal typing. He is smart, and he wouldn't just hand over an account like that. So put the pitchforks down.
@_date: 2013-11-06 07:39:09
Thanks for your feedback. I considered that, however, I didn't enjoy how it read out design wise. I kept reading it as "Bitcoin Bitcoin Accepted Here" and just looked awkward. I feel that people are more compelled to ask about it without the words on there, as those who do know Bitcoin already know the logo. Those who don't and who seek opportunity will ask what it is and learn anyway.
@_date: 2013-10-24 03:34:05
Hi Infinity,
You can do a checkout on [Cryptocables]( to automatically calculate everything including shipping for you :D Thanks for your interest!!
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:19:15
Awesome, in one piece this time I hope? haha! Sorry for the original UPS misfortune! Please post a picture when you can! :)
@_date: 2013-06-19 21:31:58
Hi! Thanks for your feedback. I still believe the original Bitcoin logo is still in use by everyone across the globe. I am not actually sure how much people are adopting the new version, other than for forum usage.
The reason why I chose this design is because of the following participants that still adopt the original logo:
* Wikipedia.
* 
* Physical Bitcoins by Casascius
* Any basic Google search on Bitcoin.
* Most other informational websites on Bitcoin information.
It is a very familiar logo and I do not wish to stray away from the original design. If the new design becomes widely addpoted, I will adjust accordingly for a future version.
@_date: 2013-10-30 20:31:34
Congratulations on your first step to awesomeness! Truly exciting! :D If you ever want to take your shop a step further, [I've created Bitcoin Accepted Here neon signs]( that you can proudly display as well down the line. Baby steps, though. Be sure to update us on your success!

Hi! There had to be room for the neon tubing room behind the actual frame, but the tubes will be as close as possible together. They need specific spacing so that they don't clash together.
Edit: Just wanted to add that this is an estimate, and it'll be closer to the original design, but the tubes cant touch. Just to clarify! :)
@_date: 2013-10-24 04:39:21
haha, truth.
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:58:46
Depends where you're at. It'll automatically calculate at checkout. Cheers
@_date: 2013-07-06 21:41:38
Yep, neon signs are fancy and expensive, so we're offering it as bare minimum as we possibly can without having to ask for DNA samples :P
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:26:56
Is yours in the photo album already? If not, can you linkage a picture here so I can add it if you don't mind? :)
@_date: 2013-11-06 02:24:27
Thanks for your kind words! I hope I do too! :P
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:08:45
No problems here. Just withdrew a chunk of change, pleasant as always.
@_date: 2013-11-15 07:13:18
Sorry, as it stands its currently not planned. It was a design choice we faced and ultimately we weren't content with "Bitcoin Bitcoin Accepted Here". We felt that it would raise more awareness and questions if it wasn't placed there, thus more folks learning about it. Those who know Bitcoin will know the logo, and those who don't are supposed to be inspired to ask about it.
@_date: 2013-10-24 05:07:41
Yes! PICTURES PLEASE! :D
@_date: 2013-10-24 03:28:09
Fixing that now! :)
@_date: 2013-12-31 03:24:40
Trust me, Shopify is way easy. If my mom can do it, your employees can do it. My mom is literally the definition of the Grandma finds the Internet meme and she runs her own shop just fine. Plus you can assign who has access to what, ect. :) Edit: Just ask them for a trial. They would be happy to help you! 
@_date: 2013-07-06 21:55:04
If you have any questions I offer support 24/7 :)
@_date: 2013-08-08 07:15:31
You would think so, but it doesn't return to the sending address. It's happened a few times with my customers and they've had to contact support and wait (sometimes a long time) for a human to get back to them for investigation.
@_date: 2013-10-26 09:36:47
If you have a bulk shipment deal with UPS or FedEX you are welcome to use your account number in regards for shipping purposes to get it overseas. However, at this time I don't personally have access to that unless I move a lot of inventory out. As for bulks, I can offer a discount on 10+ , though don't expect a huge discount margin. Please contact me directly [queen at cryptocables dawt.com] and we will chat about options that we have.  Thanks for your interest!

It will be the same price, no matter the tubing.

Hi! If you're interested in a sign you can [grab one here!]( Currently we ship from NY,NY in the USA. For those in the states (and connecting countries ie). Canada) shipping is pretty straight forward and inexpensive. :D
Regrettably, for those who are overseas, and are looking to purchase, it is still possible, however its super expensive currently to get to other countries that require air freight. This is mostly due to size (2 feet by 2 feet @ 17 lbs with all bracket mounting etc). 
We are currently working with Shipwire to get them in warehouses in the UK and Australia. I don't currently have an eta -- but as we get more information from our freight forwarder to sail the 7 seas I will be sure to make an announcement. 
Needless to say, If you don't mind the current freight charge for overseas, feel free to place an order, we'll still ship!
Thanks for your understanding!

Thank you! A lot of people actually just ordered the mostly for their wo(man)/cave light source which is beyond sufficient. I agree, would love to see entire establishments as well, maybe someone will post! :D
