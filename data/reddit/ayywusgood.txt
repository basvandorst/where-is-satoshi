As an early investor with lots of BTC looking for slow growth that's gonna stay, sure.
As a late investor, nope you would have profited much more from HODL'ing ETH alone. Not to mention the altcoins that went 1000% profit since early December.

Looks like she Switched on you.
Sorry bro, stay strong and hodl. We got ya.
@_date: 2019-07-17 11:23:41
soo BTC ends up at $87?
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:33:35
Man I’m so glad I managed to snatch a Nano when it was on sale for Black Friday. No more “What if my wallet/exchange accounts are empty when I get home” while at work. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:55:04
I get by just fine. Do you at least have a not too shitty reason for not just buying?
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:44:00
Without drunks we wouldn’t be able to HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:28:14
If you need to beg then you should probably not get into this 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:39:26
Or better yet, you could just invest with your own money like the rest of us. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:12:15
Try abc123
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:57:50
Lol whatever I tried talking some sense into you, stick to your begging then and never make progress 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:41:31
I used to do this, but we’re talking with about $400 fiat. I cashed it out fast because it started feeling too risky. Can’t imagine doing it with 3 fucking BTC without my whole body shaking with anxiety.
@_date: 2018-10-02 10:11:55
If you look closer there's also a girl trapped inside the glasses.
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:18:59
Thanks. I have no plans on selling should the price suddenly increase or decrease significantly if that’s what you mean. Read too many regret stories on here. So far I only regret getting in on this so late. 
Also, regarding getting a secure wallet. You can transfer BTC securely from Coinbase to your separate wallet, yes? Sorry, new to the whole system. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:36:54
It could be either. BTC would either dip or go up depending on what people would do with the fork. My guess is the fork itself won’t have any real impact, but BCH could take advantage and launch another pump and dump to again attempt and crash BTC. 
But if nothing happens, the fork should eventually fade away, people will sell for BTC and BTC will probably go ATH. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:47:27
It COULD happen in the next hours but it’s likely not. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:50:42
Also there’s a 2x fork happening to BTC in a couple of hours, no idea how it’s going to affect the price though. Either way at least I’ll have some 2x to play with while I wait
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:56:09
Lmao this dude, love u
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:28:50
Same problem on my iPhone 6 here 
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:40:26
he’s asking what will happen to bitcoin if say the world pulls a Fallout, and we lose connection to other continents and there are ghouls and deathclaws and shit 
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:12:08
Yup that was me when BTC dipped to $5800 lol
@_date: 2017-11-09 09:46:01
Probably a company, no?
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:56:40
That’s my secret, Cap. I’m always hodling 
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:09:15
But did he keep hodling? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:32:12
You know what I mean. HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:55:59
Kill obsession with more obsession i like your style. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:48:53
Losing the money you’re investing. Not sure what other answer you’re expecting. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:41:42
Dude I would move that to a hardware wallet immediately, that’s a lot of money, and there are recent reports of some desktop wallets getting hacked and emptied.
And to answer your question, I would guess Electrum gives you the alt coin by itself. But as far as I know the fork isn’t even happening. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:13:14
Best of luck, the exposure will hopefully give you the money back. Instead if giving 10% away though, consider putting it into a hw wallet! 
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:26:49
Best time is always now. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:08:36
This sound awfully much like that Black Mirror episode where everyone’s job was to ride a stationary bike to contribute electricity to the society and receive credits as payment. And to basically do any activity at all they had to spend those credits. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:20:25
I only invest on sunday/monday after payday that's my rule.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:49:57
Wow... Went in expecting a joke thinking the comments were just sham but there you are actually exposing your nuts and everything. Stopped watching right when you picked up the knife, no fucking way I’m watching the rest lol holy shit. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:30:03
Thank you, my money is pretty expendable so I’ll probably increase the monthly limit later on but I wanna start slow. 
And congratulations on owning 1 BTC!
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:47:21
Yeuup. If we’re lucky the price will keep rising and dropping in the 7000 range until next week, because I do not look forward to buying at $8000+. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:19:24
Nobody knows, but since its dipping a bit it’s as good as any 
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:35:58
dude I was so pissed when it hit $5800 and I couldn’t do shit. Clearly the wrong month to have bought a monitor for 700 dollars and lent out money to a relative
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:22:35
U heard him, food stamp fork is coming, invest!!
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:41:40
Yup, down to $7150 now.
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:58:53
Well so far he’s at least doubled his profits if he bought the BTC 4 months ago. Wish him well 
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:46:22
Technical analysis aka educated guess by an uneducated man (thanks Baby Driver). 
Just messing but what are you basing this on? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:32:49
idiocy? he was joking and you're getting mad over it for some reason
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:21:12
Ah, well if you’re considering investing over a long period you should still get one. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:59:29
Considering the amount of money you’re investing, yes it would be profitable to wait for some more dip. I doubt we’ll be seeing $5500 in the near future though, but $6k could be a possibility. And at the same time, there’s a chance we’ll not go below $6500 this year. 
Really consider all the risks in this, only invest if you’re ready to lose it all, and don’t beat yourself up if you buy before a unforeseen dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:00:01
Literally me last weekend lmao 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:00:46
I just hope it stays low until my paycheck 
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:22:01
Sorry I was a little misinformed, a fork COULD happen in the next hours but it’s not certain. The fork was cancelled, but people are still mining it so there’s a possibility it might come anyway. Coinbase sent an email out that they are prepared for it in case it happens as scheduled.
@_date: 2017-11-09 10:33:30
Not sad, that’s how you sleep with $ucce$$.
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:48:27
oh come on man you had to expect this when you chose it lol 
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:19:31
I think the main issue is, while Leo is driving a Lambo, us Crypto investors are riding tricycles at the moment.
@_date: 2018-11-29 23:42:03

Sounds easy enough, thanks.
@_date: 2017-10-30 10:10:33
I’m new and really starting to consider investing $50 a month.  How is the process?
@_date: 2018-12-17 10:46:42
It was a joke regarding the interview
@_date: 2018-12-17 09:58:14
Did I ever tell you the definition of insanity?
@_date: 2018-12-17 08:04:46
So many comments saying "oh but he's been on before", yeah we know but maybe people are interested in his thoughts on the crash.
