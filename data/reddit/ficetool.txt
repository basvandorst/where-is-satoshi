Honestly, at the moment bitcoin only succeeds because of its reputation. It's absolutely insane to me how people justify 20 $ transaction costs and more.

While that's your decision, a paper wallet is easier to steal from and you won't have protection when transferring crypto. Also, you'll need multiple paper wallets to hold multiple currencies if you want to buy more than just bitcoin.
However, I'm really not interested in convincing you. It's your decision how you want to protect your money

Doesn't lead lightning to crazy centralization? I saw a bcash video hating on lighting and explaining how business would have to actually pay for channels and to be a lightning hub.
Obviously, since it's shared on r/btc, there will be wrong information in there, but in general it sounded very convincing go me and made me doubt lightning is auch a great solution. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:00:57
You forget the transaction fees in your equation.

@_date: 2017-12-03 16:16:13
With the fees as high as they currently are, I don't think mass adoption is going to happen anytime soon. Bitcoin is just not usable as a day to day currency at this point in time.

Are you really that blind? If he had sold the bug on the black market he could have gotten so much more for it.... Why is it greedy to be disappointed when the company does not care about you and actually supports criminal action this way? Especially since it is VERY hard to track him if all he does is sell the exploit and he could have gotten away with a  LOT of money very easily but chose the right thing and got punished for it hardcore. 
@_date: 2015-12-20 16:56:12
No he shouldnt. He could have cashed out without any real consequences and got out 100ks of $. Rewarding someone who does NOT abuse a bug like this with only 5k$ is beyond pathetic. If I were him I would have abused the shit out of the second one
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:53:08
Be aware though, that your wallet will cost an additional 20$ this way for no reason whatsoever.
I also bought my nano this way, but in retrospect it was an idiotic idea. I paid more than I had to instead of just using normal money. 
@_date: 2015-12-20 17:01:45
Or you sell it to someone else who is willing to exploit it, come off clean with a huge cash out. Why would anyone be stupid enough to report a bug of this scale to the page owners when they get nothing out of it anyway compared to the other option with which he would have gotten away with as well?
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:46:24
I'd love that... I still have my fork BTG but the price is so incredibly low I don't wanna sell xD 
@_date: 2015-12-20 17:05:29
He could have sold the bug, cashed out big time and not risked anything
@_date: 2015-12-20 17:04:43
He could have just sold the second exploit to someone else and chased out big time there
@_date: 2018-05-04 05:32:55
The sub does Literally nothing else than meme and bash bcash. It's not even possible to get news about the technology anymore cuz there's so much bullshit in here. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 05:04:10
Thank you so much for your detailed reply! 
@_date: 2018-05-08 20:22:07
Out of curiosity, because I'm really not that familiar with how lightning and bcash works: would they even need lightning if their on chain transactions are fast and cheap enough?
Again, obviously this comes at the cost of decentralization and security. But if you ignored those things (as they do) lightning would be unneeded, wouldn't it? 
@_date: 2018-05-08 18:34:05
It's pretty easy to understand actually. Since their narrative is that bcash is closest to the white paper they claim the history dating back to the white paper, hence the link to peer to peer electronic cash system. While btc has mostly become a store of value, and is NOT a p2p ecash system anymore, the consider it to be forked off of the bitcoin idea and claim that it's an alt and only bcash is true to the white paper and thus bitcoin.
They're obviously ignoring majority consensus  and everything but facts hasn't stopped them ever. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:08:42
Because, in my opinion, it won't be that easy. It is a nice vision, of course. But imagine anyone not tech savy installing random apps from the app store and trust them with their money? This guarantuess fraud. How is someone with no clue supposed to differentiate between fraud/scam apps and legitimate ones for example. 
Using a card is usually managed by a bank and explained by them, someone a customer can trust (within certain limits of course). Apple/google do an AWFUL job of keeping their app stores clean. So there's no guarantuee that people who have to install all the necessary apps themselves, won't get cheated somewhere along the way. 
Just to mention one example why it is incredibly hard to go mainstream with something like lightning.
@_date: 2018-05-08 20:46:37
Lol bro. Get a life. Are you actually threatening me? XD
Considering that other people understood, that I was simply giving THEIR reasoning and THEIR arguments, maybe you should be careful with your words.

I’ll keep an eye on that. Thanks for lettting me know
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:21:15
I am not doing any of these things and don't hold bcash but I still think lightning is a horrible idea. Not because of the technology itself but rather because I think it will be insanely difficult/impossible to make the average joe use it when all they want to do is pay for a coffee. No one will ever bother with payment channels and other stuff when there is a simpler way of doing things which currently is bcash. Not, because they will scale better in the long term or because they are honest people or because the techonology is better, but mainly because it is EASIER to use. People who have no clue don't care about 5 years from now when there will be scalability issues or even how decentralized a coin is. They care about using it in an easy way.... and AT THE MOMENT bcash is doing a way better job there imo than the bitcoin core developers.

That's not how it works. You cannot ask for more than one sentence replies. That would show that most people have no idea what they are talking about and only repeat phrases they have heard elsewhere (this happens in both subs).
@_date: 2018-05-08 20:45:23
Couldn't they just keep increasing the blocksize? That should be able to handle human money transactions (not IOT and other stuff of course).
Again, I understand there are crazy draw backs to increasing the block size like that. But since those don't bother bcash users, those are irrelevant for now ;)
Thanks for taking the time to reply.

@_date: 2019-03-07 12:25:10
Since I cannot change the IP address in the router, no matter what my RPi shows, I have decided to try and use TOR in order to bypass the NAT. 
In my opinion the screen looks a lot better now. [Pi Screen](
The only thing I do not understand now: The IP is green, I have more than 8 peers (Yay me) but when checking if the ports are open [Port Check]( It still says:  rx6ycekf2mmfqpj6.onion:8333 is unreachable. 
@_date: 2019-03-06 15:42:26
Oh, interesting. That's good to know and actually makes a lot of sense :D
**Error:** I could **not** see your service on "IP" on port (**8333**)Reason: Connection timed out
edit: It might be interesting that the IP that's shown on the Raspberry LCD is different from the one my computer has? Shouldn't it theoretically be the same then?
@_date: 2019-03-06 15:59:56
So the problem is with my router then? This is what it looks like in the router settings.
[Ports in router](
@_date: 2019-03-06 16:57:12
The internal IP was chosen by the router, I couldn't do anything to change it.
What you said about the ISP is VERY interesting though! I AM with unitymedia and when I tried to find out my IPv6 address on [test-ipv6.com]( it said the following: "It seems as if you are using a tunnel mechanism for either IPv4 or IPv6."
When running the test for IPv6 on websistent it gives me the following:
Port **8333** is not accessible on host - Error: 13 Permission denied
I have one thing to add though: I made a mistake before. When I checked on canyouseeme I still had my vpn active (since all the other times I tried to use the address of the Rpi and didn't need to disable it). When using my actual computer IP it gives me a different error message.
**Error:** I could **not** see your service on "IP" on port (**8333**)Reason: **Connection refused**
Sorry about that.
I want to thank you again for the time you are putting into this. I'd have no idea how to deal with this otherwise.
@_date: 2019-03-11 22:50:49
Haha okay, that's good to know. I didn't see that on the raspiblitz page. I'll try to get my money out of the channels again and just manually connect a few channels. Thanks for your help! 
@_date: 2019-03-06 12:06:37
unfortunately I can't use canyouseeme. It doesn't let me change the IP address (tried with 3 different browsers). I simply can't edit the numbers in the box. So it's checking if the port is open on my main computer, I think, but not on the RPi.

You have to port forward through your VPN 
Unfortunately I am using ProtonVPN and they do not support port forwarding =/
 






It is.... I had forgotten about the VPN when I wrote this. When switching it off, the IP is the same.


or  it could mean that you are not running bitcoind - a port is only open  if there is a software service listening on this port - your post says  it's running and connecting to peers  
or it could be that your ISP's carrier-grade NAT can not forward ports 
Can you explain what you mean by the first part? When activating port forwarding in the router, I can choose the device I wanna open ports for. There, I select the Pi and the router automatically fills in the local IP. 
[Pi Screen]( This is what it shows me. The partly cut out IP is red since it can't be reached, but I do have peers so the client SHOULD be running. 
Does that mean that the carrier-grade NAT is the only possible option left, why this isn't working? Or am I missing something else?
@_date: 2019-11-06 05:44:45

Thanks for providing the link. Unfortunately I have also found this step by step introduction before and it's basically what I did.
The end result looks like this:

Despite this, I still can't reach the RPi from the outside.
@_date: 2019-03-07 21:42:17
Okay. Then at least I know what to look for now. :) 
Once again, thank you so much for your patience and your time. You have helped me a LOT. Especially since I didn't even know that the ISP could be a problem in this whole scenario and would have never figured this out myself.

@_date: 2019-04-05 09:03:58
When I opened it there was a minimum requirement of 250k Satoshi. I'm ASSUMING that you'd send a transaction with too low of a fee and the channel wouldn't get closed since the transaction wouldn't get mined.
But considering my understanding of the whole process is not really that great its also possible that something else entirely might be happening. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:24:36
The raspiblitz screen gives me two balances. The one for my node wallet and the one for my channel balance. I was talking about the channel balance :) 
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:32:40
Node name is Kiichigoraikou.
Others said that commit fees are the reason the balance is changing. As I didn't know commit fees were even  thing I couldn't understand why my interface would show lower balances. However, considering that transaction fees have been rising these last few days it makes perfect sense that the commit fees would also rise and thus a larger amount of sats would be reserved for closing the channel.
Also, calling bullshit on me asking for help and an explanation, kind of doesn't make sense at all and makes you look like a jackass. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 21:26:15
Can you explain what you mean by that? I'm not sure what 1ml is supposed to mean. Sorry :(
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:26:23
Someone else in this thread posted that lightning channels are holding back a certain amount since you need to pay a fee for closing the channel. Considering that transaction fees are a lot higher than they were 2-3 weeks ago, it's possible that this is the reason the channel balance is shown as lower.
If you don't believe me I can send you a picture of the screen :)
Edit: the link you posted. What do they mean by "capacity"? Is that the amount the wallet holds or the amount that is in the channel that I opened? 
@_date: 2019-04-05 04:34:05
According to what others have written in here it seems that the raspiblitz doesn't show the total balance on the screen. It seems to be total balance - the fee needed for closing the channel. Apparently Other wallets show them both separately. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:44:00
I agree that the lightning network is in no way ready for mass adoption. To be honest, I'm not entirely convinced by it myself.
However, using user interface and problems like handling the channels as a reason is kind of pointless since that's stuff that can easily be changed and made more user friendly. Heck, even spreading resources further might make it easier for people to help themselves. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:19:19
Why is that?
@_date: 2019-04-05 15:52:08
Why would it be stupid? If the only option is to open highly funded channels, the future of the lightning networks looks rather bleak.
If I open multiple channels I can at least help with routing smaller payments. On top of that I simply wanted to give it a try. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:51:04
That may be as it is. But that's up to the community. If people aren't happy with the hubs cuz they get exploited, it's up to everyone to spread channels and not take the most convenient route and connect to big hubs.
Again, I see your argument and agree with it to a certain degree. But considering that bch already follows the "bigger blocks" route, why not give lightning a try and see how it works out? It doesn't make sense if all currencies follow the same approach. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 15:56:57

Suggestions? I mean for the little funds that I have I'm using a hardware wallet anyway. The raspiblitz is mainly for helping the bitcoin network and having a go at the lightning network.
Having a look at different UI might be interesting though. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 16:27:46
I'll use this post to ask instead of making my own thread:
Can someone explain to me why my lightning channel is losing funds? I set up a raspiblitz node and opened a channel. The minimum I could put into that channel was 250000 sat.
For the longest time, my channel had 24x.xxx in there. I assumed that transaction fees for opening the channel had been deducted.
Yesterday the balance dropped further to 234972 sat.
Can anybody explain what's happening here? It's not a large amount of money so it's no really a problem but I assumed that the channel value shouldn't change as I'm not using it and no one else does either?

Tbh I used the standard settings from the raspiblitz since there weren't really any options to customize.
What you just said would at least make sense though. Considering that the amount in the channel has been decreasing more quickly over the last few days and didn't really change at all in the weeks beforehand.
Is there any way for me to check the reserved amount? 
@_date: 2019-04-04 16:05:24
Thanks, I appreciate your help! I didn't know the lightning network reddit. I'll go there and ask if they can confirm your idea :) 
@_date: 2019-04-05 15:59:32
....? Wtf? I created a node for over a 100€, I SPECIFICALLY say in the OP that the money itself is not a big deal. Where do you get the impression I'm whining over a few cents? 
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:29:15
Thank you :) someone else also posted this before. You're right that the screen only shows the amount of sats that I can use. Until today I wasn't even aware that commit fees even existed so I got rather confused when the balance shrank more and more.
Thanks for helping to clarify the situation! 
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:35:17
I wouldn't mind. But I'd have no idea how to do that to be honest ;)
Others said that commit fees might be the reason and since transaction fees have been rising these last few days, more sats were reserved for closing the channel.
I simply didn't know about commit fees and didn't understand what was happening :) 
@_date: 2018-03-12 07:45:57
You didn't even watch it and cry about the segment like a 5 year old xD
@_date: 2018-03-12 08:36:36
Considering that literally every point you made was wrong I would say it wasn't. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 15:53:56
Thanks for your reply :) I'm so excited about the other one, haha 
@_date: 2018-03-06 11:18:04
Is this the update they announced that replaces the chrome extensions? Or is it only an update to the ledger nano itself, not how it is used? 
@_date: 2018-03-17 09:22:30
Troll? Otherwise, could you elaborate? 
@_date: 2018-03-12 07:40:53
It was anything but that lol, did you even watch it? 
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:24:16
Actually no, why would there be schadenfreude on my part? I'm happy I earned money, but I'm not sure where schadenfreude would come into play. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:55:16
That's bs. You have no idea how a public service works. The post office cannot be profitable since they are forced to deliver to regions where only a handful of people are living which would never be worth it for them, if they were a for profit organization.
Same with public transportation. You'd never have a nightly service since it just wouldn't be worth it for the company. However, since it IS a public service, the post office as well as public transportation also cater to regions/people that aren't actually gaining them any profit.
Offering a service to everyone, even when losing money and being profitable just doesn't go together. 
Please... Educate yourself before you act all smart add. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:09:39
You are aware I was basically making fun of the stupid argument they use when they always praise their low transaction fees, while only having a fraction of the btc transaction volume,right?..... 
@_date: 2018-03-12 07:42:09
You make an excellent point here. I especially like the nuances that you use to elaborate your core argument. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:37:32
:D 
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:06:59
I really think it's a good explanation for beginners =)
@_date: 2018-03-07 06:21:00
Or.... OR, out could let OP handle their money in a way they see fit 
@_date: 2018-03-21 21:38:42
Hahaha, sure. And after no one would pay 100$ for a ticket to fund empty trains and simply call an uber instead, nightly service would be shut down. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:30:57
You're *

I'm legit hyped for this :) 
@_date: 2018-02-14 10:35:35
Because every kind of valid criticism=shilling? You are pathetic
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:20:38
Maybe litecoin? Since they had their 30% rise just recently.
@_date: 2017-10-07 08:40:00
I'm a noob myself but it makes sense to buy beforehand since you will have bitcoin on both chains then and basically make free money. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:29:03
Well to the other cryptos of course. OP said so far they have increased and decreased by the same rate. Now, Litecoin has increased by a fair margin more than the others and OP COULD ask why that is. 
(I am just guessing here)
@_date: 2018-03-12 08:38:08
Yes, better. Thanks. Even though I'm curious where you take the propaganda part from. I don't watch him a lot, since I'm not American, but whenever I saw one of his segments he used sources that showed where the information came from, even though I don't always agree with him. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 07:41:25
I don't know much about the differences between the various coins. But to me, as it is probably intended, the article sounds Very convincing.
Can anyone link me something where I can compare the different arguments by myself? A neutral site if possible?
It's just very very hard to inform myself properly on reddit when r/btc accuses r/bitcoin of censorship and ruining everything and vice versa :/
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:41:48
Thank you for your post.
While I will pick a side eventually, my OP really wasn't about that. I still struggle with some basic terms which makes it harder to understand all the arguments and possibilities. 
That's why I tried to find neutral information, explaining everything. But your argument, why that this is pretty difficult, makes sense of course.
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:38:17
I appreciate your help!! However, I am that much of a noob that I cannot you actually figure out what to do with transactions. I don't have much time due to work and only slowly manage to understand everything that is involved with bitcoin =) 
To be honest, however, it DID sound fishy to me what the article said as I read before that the signatures are just not part of the actual block anymore but still there (hope I said this right ;) )
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:49:09
I will check out bitcoin.org, thank you!
I have spent most of my time on r/bitcoin so far, but when I had a look at r/btc once and read the complete opposite of what is usually being said here, I realized that I literally have no idea if r/bitcoin is the same, or totally different. So I decided that I want to educate myself enough, so I can form my own opinion =)
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:46:28
No, not at all. Sorry :D 
Even with my VERY limited understanding I found some arguments of the article weird. Also, the tone was anything but neutral (e.G. when describing the core group), which makes it a dubious source at best. 
I genuinely want to learn more about the different arguments and problems, so I can form an opinion myself. Or, to phrase it better, I want to understand why someone is lying to me instead of only trusting others to explain everything to me.
I hope this made sense. Nevertheless, thank you for your offer, I appreciate it!!
@_date: 2018-03-26 08:13:03
So you mean we're only having ten times the amount of bcash transactions now? 
@_date: 2017-10-17 08:07:19
I am not sure but to me it seems that you either did not read my post or chose not to address it.
I am looking for a place where I can inform myself. Help would be appreciated.
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:37:08
Thank you so much! I will check it out.
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:30:27
No risk with a hardware wallet as long as you don't write down your seed digitally.
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:43:17
To ask questions I need some basic understanding of the problems and the concepts ;) Which is what I was trying to get with my OP. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 17:18:52
Is there an idea out there already to combat the routing problem? Quite a few BCH supporters show videos where they claim that routing is super difficult in the LN network because balances might be "on the wrong side" and money can't be routed through. Especially with the channels always changing. 
Or is this still something a solution needs to be found for?
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:50:17
Because it's simply not true that they need your phone.
And to address your question: because nothing has happened with ledger yet. Simple as that. Whereas there a multiple confirmed ios breaches where hackers can gain full control over your phone. Until something happens, I'm assuming that a company that makes their money by selling secure hardware and where no security breach has been found yet, are more secure. Especially since the hardware wallet needs to be connected for every transaction and confirm said transaction.
All it takes for a hacker to hack your software wallet is breach your phone security. Which, as of now, has happened multiple times for all manufactures.
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:53:35
I haven't read anything about the actually wallet code being hacked, as I don't particularly care to be honest with you.
My main concern with any software wallet is what I wrote above, that after a hacker has access to a wallet, they can do whatever they want even without the seed. With a hardware wallet that is simply not possible as of now.
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:31:24
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:33:55
How is that a risk? If you wanna be extra secure you split your seed in three and give one piece to two people you trust. Safe seed, no one can reconstruct it.
The second part doesn't make much sense to me. If you're using a trezor/ledger, then that's not a small company.
@_date: 2017-10-30 10:12:55
I really enjoyed reading this. You had me hooked till then end! 
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:34:57
Well, if you're an idiot about it, sure. But that's simply what bitcoin is about. If you are careful nothing is going to happen to your seed. If you aren't, you lose your stuff. However, that's negligence on your part and not security.
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:36:54
The part that you don't understand is why a hard wallet is inherently safer than any software wallet can ever be. You might wanna read up on that.
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:53:22
Thanks for your answer!! =)
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:59:06
Hasn't there JUST been news released about ios being vulnerable to a simple call/website visit that leaves you at full mercy of the hacker? Since they were able to fully control the phone?
As to how all the security aspects you mentioned can be circumvented, I don't know. But since it has happened before I have to assume it's possible? Can't tell you more about that since I don't know jack about hacking ;) 
But yeah, it's what I meant. With a hardware wallet it doesn't matter if your software is breached. You can verify everything on the hardware wallet itself and even use it safely on compromised systems. A software wallet never gives you that option.
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:39:24
I have sold my BCH too. This, however, is not about picking a site. I honestly simply want to understand the concepts and differences. No matter which concept is better or not.
Thank you for your advice though =)
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:57:57
Coinbase.com or kraken.com helped me get into everything :) 
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:41:41
Bro, you have no clue what hardware wallets even do, do you? Otherwise you wouldn't say stuff like "trust Apple" :'D anyway, if you're okay with being one Keylogger away from losing all your funds, then I guess ignorance is bliss and there's nothing else for us to discuss :)
Have a good day sir
@_date: 2018-07-04 16:56:53
You seem very angry... Are you trolling and trying to start hate on other cryptos?
There's no need at all to "fight back". The better currency will win in the end. If that is bitcoin, all the trash coins will fade into oblivion. The focus should be on advancing the technology and finding solutions to the current problems. Not fighting a useless war against other currencies, when BTC itself is far from perfect at the moment. 
@_date: 2019-09-26 14:06:25
One last thing, in case that came over wrongly: software wallets make a lot of sense to keep smaller amounts on since hardware wallets are way too impractical for every day use. But I'd treat them like an actual wallet and not carry around large amounts of money. Especially since a robber could also force you to give him everything you have (if there is no option for a secret wallet, hidden with a passphrase).
Anyway, have a nice rest of the week. It's almost weekend again. ��
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:55:47
What's your point? If the software the wallet is built on is proven to be unsafe and the hacker only needs to access it once for you to lose everything, then we're back to what I wrote above: if you're fine with being one key logger wlaway from losing everything, then that's your decision and the risk you are willing to take.
@_date: 2018-04-07 17:52:29
Are your serious? Or really that dense that you simply assume every living situation for every Indian is the same? Did you actually just compare someone from a super rural, poor area, who has no access to banking in general, with someone who lives in a city, pays bills with his bank account, gets their salary on said bank account and actually depends on that bank account?
@_date: 2018-04-20 19:27:25
Wow, that was amazing. I never considered that the different addresses would be simply new transactions. Thank you! I've been wondering about this for quite some time actually :D
@_date: 2018-04-19 10:51:24
Can  anyone help me out here? This is something I have struggled with for quite some time. Obviously, if an exchange knows your name and you transfer btc away from the exchange to your wallet, and then transfer that btc to a drug/weapons dealer/x, then of course they know that you paid for illegal services.
However, looking at my nano s, after I sent bitcoin to my wallet address, the address changes. How can law enforcement/on this case Amazon know that the new address so belongs to me and can follow my btc through the network? As far as I understand this, you'd need to know the seed to understand that these two addresses belong together? 
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:48:39
Because we're talking about non tech savvy users... Not pros.
Also, why the hell would I spend 50€ to "try out this new crypto thing"... That's absurd.
Obviously those hardware wallets are good, as you said, that's entirely besides the point though since that's not what we're talking about at all.
Edit: also, I'd like you to teach my mom to get her music from her windows PC to an apple device.... I'd be entertained for days ^^
@_date: 2018-04-07 09:25:40
And this is relevant how?
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:37:11
How would they know I sent the money to the dealer? As I wrote in my first post. My ledger nano gets an entirely new address, based on my seed, after I sent btc to it. How would Amazon or law enforcement know that this is the same person?
Money gets sent to my nano to address A. When I send money, it is sent from address B. How can these 2 addresses be connected by someone not knowing the seed? 
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:24:56
You say this as if it was easy to just pull all the money out of the bank accounts and live without one, lol
@_date: 2018-04-18 05:41:57

@_date: 2017-05-14 17:27:50
The straw that broke the camel's back was when you started talking about fake news and mainstream media. You lost all credibility there. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 05:06:21
We already have an attempt to destroy bitcoin. It's called Bcash. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 04:57:28

Do not forget the illuminaty!!! They are in on this too!!
@_date: 2017-05-15 14:35:08
You didn't provide anything son. You didn't give ANYthing that could back up what you said. All you did was spew nonsense without any content. Sorry son. Look up the meaning of the word "fact" and then "random conspiracy bullshit" and see what's closer to what you posted. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:48:57
They Really aren't.
As a new user, you need to spend 50€+ just to get one. Then you need to understand the device, then you need to set it up, then you need to register with an exchange, then, out need to send money to that exchange, then you need to send, your crypto to your wallet address.
Do you even know how many possibilities there are to get scammed along the way? This is fat from user friendly. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:37:24
But how would they even know that it's the same person when the addresses are different? 
@_date: 2017-05-14 20:46:36
I dont know anymore of those =( You won :D 
@_date: 2017-07-24 09:43:48
This. I transferred all my coins (not too many lol) there. Does this mean I will automatically have bitcoin and the same amount of the new coin in there then? 
@_date: 2017-05-15 14:47:09
I love how you are generalizing without any knowledge whatsoever =) Keep doing so. 
In Germany we have two news stations for example that are not for profit. But without generalizing and being vague, conspiracy crap wouldn't work, so I see where you are coming from. 
@_date: 2019-05-12 08:34:45
Or ledger wallet
@_date: 2019-05-12 08:33:27
To be a little more objective: ledger wallet offers the same functions and if you were to use your btc regularly, their new model even has a Bluetooth connection. It comes down to preference which hardware wallet you prefer
