I'm sure some Chinese officails have made some money on this news. Pays to know the news before the news.

More or less than everyone else.

I like the silver version too.

These guys are based in Vancouver and do a pretty good job. They have recently added LTC and support BCC as well. Only downside is it may take sometime to get verified. 
Good luck!

Am I the only one that prefers this version?
