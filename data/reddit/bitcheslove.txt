I'd like to close my account. I own them all. Please close at once. If you don't trust me I'll be pissed and you didn't make them verify anything so I don't expect to

I've made over a thousand dollars in 3 weeks.
@_date: 2013-04-17 02:52:48
4 weeks* 
And I work 9 hour days at a computer with a ticker always on top. I buy/sell on a 10% change usually unless a quick drop is happening at my buy time, then I wait. I made a lot on the 60-90 trade day.
On a day that goes 70-80 I trade upwards of 10 times those days.

Very cool! Thanks for posting the warehouse pics and stuff. That's what shows the success to me more than a single promo photo

Manual. By work at a computer I meant my regular job, but I have a ticket set to update every 10 seconds. Once I see $5 up down up down I take notice. Then when it drops $7-10 I buy or if it goes up 7-10 I Tend to sell. I don't always hit the peaks but I hold until it swings back. At the small percentage I operate on that is usually a few hours at most. I might break even or make a ton (to me that's $400) in one day. 
@_date: 2013-08-11 20:38:08
No. Why would they?
@_date: 2013-04-17 17:45:43
I don't have a ton to invest but i have very few blimishes so far luckily
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:37:24
Can't I just buy a bit Coin, xfer it to my wallet, sell it, xfer to wallet, buy one, etc. how much extra info is there for me to release on 10 vs 1 transaction..?
@_date: 2013-10-24 15:34:35
T be honest I wouldn't recommend mining at this point. It takes a while and prob wouldn't pay off. Unless you have a super computer of sorts. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 02:43:16
If I buy 1 coin at 50 and sell at 70 I've made $20.
Then I buy at 60 and sell at 70 I've made $10.
Buy 65 sell 70, 5.
In that example I made 35 dollars from 50-70. Had I held I'd have made only 20. I paid a .55% fee. a few dollars.
Maybe my example is biases, I just made it up.

Only invest what you plan on losing. If you can't afford to never see that money again I wouldn't invest it
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:40:00
Why doesn't everyone do this constantly all day? No salary pays that much per hour even if you can only buy and sell 10 an hour that's $100 per hour
@_date: 2013-04-16 01:04:31
Thanks, sorry.
@_date: 2013-04-17 00:01:45
I've been burned once already. And I agree about spend what you will lose, that's why I've stored my initial investment  already. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 00:54:51
Do you plan to only go for long term? I invested enough to buy 2 bitcoins last week at 60, sold both at 90 and bought again at 70. I've done that enough to earn a "free" bitcoin, which I deposit into my cold savings account.
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:38:00
I use campbx and USD 
@_date: 2013-05-02 19:15:36
Hah, no worries.
I consider myself pretty amateur as well.
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:25:10
Unless you bought at 260. You still have to check before all payments

Someone has to make the money

@_date: 2013-04-17 23:49:43
I use Camp bx and have it set up so if you need help setting it up let me know
@_date: 2013-04-17 01:17:17
How do people lose money outright? 
I have no education in the markets and have only made 1 mistake (buying at 70 earlier when it dropped to 60). If someone watches the tickers all day how do you lose money? Honest question
@_date: 2013-05-02 19:16:46
It seems kind of funny that they gave you reddit gold instead of a bitcointip
@_date: 2013-04-17 02:39:40
I jest
@_date: 2013-06-15 18:57:40
You have to sell them to someone. If I only seek one for $100 thats all that's forsake at that price. It's like buying 1000 items on eBay 
@_date: 2013-05-02 18:53:13
Camp bx is the exchange you'll need to use. Its their main method to buy and sell. The widget us just a price ticker I watch. I watch charts on bitcoin chart every now and then to watch trends. I only watch camp bx market data
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:45:00
There you go sir.
Right click on it for always on top.
Play with it for a bit/read the top of the site for setup info.
You set it up with other exchanges ticker pages if you play with it enough
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:26:13
As a merchant why is that savings worth the risk of bitcoin fluctuation?
@_date: 2013-04-17 17:40:02
I'll answer this when i make it home later. Don't have my laptop with me g here
@_date: 2013-05-02 04:40:07
I earn about $40 a week doing it and I set auto buys/sells for the prices I want so I don't have to do much. I have a ticket widget on my desktop. It takes maybe a minute. 
I also have plenty of down time and my boss doesn't care.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:28:28
1btc is $80 right now in one exchange and $90 in another. It's been the same difference almost all day. Can I simply buy 1 coin in A and sell it in B? 
@_date: 2013-05-02 13:08:24
Camp bx. Orders last months.
