Op, your IP address is showing. You might want to edit them out and repost if your super privacy worried. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:05:07
Ahh thank you

The pool of all unconfirmed transactions that haven’t been mined due to low fees or high traffic

Doesn’t bitcoin have enough nodes to support the network? (I could be wrong) you could run a node for a smaller coin struggling to keep nodes online possibly if you want to help some smaller coins.

Again I could be very wrong, second opinions?

Much wow. Such moon.

Most people under 18 get in to crypto by buying amazon gift cards than selling them for crypto online, it’s how all the sub 18 people I know have gotten into cryptos 
Edit: but if there was an atm around where I’m from I’d be putting in loads more 
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:24:39
BINGO! I was going to look for that link
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:41:04
You could sell them one p2p market like r/giftcardexchange Or r/redditbay . Just don’t get scammed. If your able to use a coinbase transaction to avoid fees, more people will likely trade with you.
@_date: 2018-01-20 19:06:21
If I know how everything works, y should be able to use the same pup/priv keys as the coins you held when the forked happened and you should be able to send the forked coin out of them to an exchange or new wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:22:56
Couple of days? Haven’t been following tx times lately so I’m not sure
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:19:10
You could buy a reloadable Visa card then put how much you want into and use that on coinbase. (You’d have to look around and see if coinbase accepts burner Visa cards)
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:39:15
Web hosting, (Any cpu only cryptos? Do those exist?), have it play lots of ads over and over (see r/beermoney), or try “storj” where you can get paid to store information for the cloud
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:22:18
If you have PayPal r/cash4cash is a nice place
If your selling amazon gift cards for btc r/redditbay is your place. 
Gl and have fun hodling!
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:38:37
How so? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:27:55
Let the wallet sync
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:28:55
Yes, both subs have a reputation system so people can show how many trades others have done. Any sort of scamming is banned automatically. 
Trading with people who have high reputation is what you should go for since they have built up a reputation that they don’t want to destroy because if they do it will ruin them and no one will trade with them.

Doge goes to moon! We all hope for 1¢ per coin  
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:42:11
Why? Because it do.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:01:38
Maybe use PayPal to buy btc then use something like shapeshift.io to exchange coin to coin without having to make a profile
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:22:37
Honestly I haven’t looked into the lightning network, it could be a fix
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:45:44
(Most of r/dogecoin is memeing around And I was going for a mostly joking attitude)
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:28:07
Yup, it’s basically past gpus and is into asic machines. Maybe find something else to make money with the machines?
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:13:45
Unicode consortium. iOS devs don’t make text or emojis, all of that is done with Unicode. (Apple didn’t invent the emoji!)
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:53:09
You could make an amazon cloud hosting free tier account and let it do the 10k+ in smaller batches so it can sit there and check all of them
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:03:52
Bch is pulling all the funds from other altcoins so prices are dropping across the board. It’s a sad day.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:43:48
I don’t think adoption in stores will happen :/ fees get pricey.
I’d like to see dealerships and higher range places take btc since the fees in proportion are a lot lower percentage of the overall cost
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:03:51
[dogecoin did this]( but with NASCAR, so it could work for btc.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:45:44
It started as a joke (I believe) but it’s now a legitimate currency. It goes for ~$2.60/k right now (1/4¢ per coin) and the network fees are usually 1-2 doge. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:54:36
I believe it pulls the balance into the new wallet, so you’ll probably be paying a tx fee. (I could be wrong)
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:09:55
Dogecoin has little to no wait time and roughly 1/3¢ transaction free.^lmaothewholecurrencyisameme

Mmmmm the classic buy high sell low!
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:44:38
I own some dogecoin. Do y’all consider that a shitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:18:05
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:18:52
If your going to go with an alt go with dogecoin, best altcoin out there.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:41:36
So bill gates could just buy all the bitcoin, doesn’t that mean he could buy all of it and make it’s seem in super high demand?
Edit: yes people could hodl to their coins. (What I mean is buy all the available bitcoin causing high demand
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:46:21
Put the CC in a PayPal account and have trust in people not scamming you on subreddits like r/cash4cash ?
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:57:34
To get around having to be 18 for PayPal you could buy amazon gift cards then trade them on somewhere like r/giftcardexchange for btc
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:45:50
That is an upside! Better get in on some doge and ltc while they are on sale
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:26:03
When I first heard of it I figured some company needs a whole lot of computing power and just payed people in a magical internet currency for it.
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:55:45
You can use r/cash4cash and get some PayPal or other money.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:06:18
Sadly yeah, but it has a decent sized following r/dogecoin. So if there is going to be a obscure coin that makes it mainstream It could be doge
@_date: 2018-05-13 15:34:42
r/cashforcash is an option. They best way to not get scammed is to trade with people that have a positive reputation with multiple confirmed trades before hand
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:32:13


Jesus.

HEY! Don’t diss my 36¢ of dogecoin! It’s my most valuable crypto currency right now /s

Will fix in v4 of the photoshop this is v3 
Will link when fixed
@_date: 2017-04-05 20:05:28
It has been done
This is v3 of the photoshop, will fix the circle in v4

Ontop of that why does your site auto play a video of monkeys? Big turn off imo
Edit: only happen if you look at the link in the Reddit app, not safari.
@_date: 2018-03-05 23:02:47
Local bitcoins or r/cash4cash work but are sometimes a hassle to use
@_date: 2017-10-08 12:33:39
