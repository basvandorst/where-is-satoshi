No. It depends on the number of inputs that are necessary to add to the transaction to complete the total amount you want to transact.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:23:13
You can use this web app [CheaperFee]( for calculate the minimum fee posible.

In the long term, keep increasing the block size is not the best solution if we want a decentralized network. Yes it works now, but lets see in the future

Mmm not blocking or slowing down packets that travel across your ISP infrastructure???
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:29:43
Yes but I have to warning you. It's just an estimation based on the present state of the mempool. I've used the API from bitcoinfees.earn.com , so my app just take the data and present it simplified and in diferent units for more convenience
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:02:50
For the next time I recommend you to use a web app I develop last week
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:34:09
You can try to optimize the fees in your transactions by using this web app I built last week
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:46:13
Thank you so much! Yes, you have my address at the bottom of the web
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:05:46
For the next time I recommend you to use a web app like this one:
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:35:49
"Payment failed to send. This can happen due to temporary network connectivity issues or an unexpected server error"
Good start...

Here is an easy to use web app to calculate the minimum fee possible
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:58:13
For the next time in your offline wallet you could use this web app I developed for calculate the minimum fee you should pay
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:16:08
You can use this web app to calculate the minimum fee: [CheaperFee](
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:34:47
Free market regulate that. If it becomes so expensive many mining farms will have to close, then less hash power will be required for minning.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:47:02
Yes in electrum at least you can replace the fee with another higher fee. 
You can use this web app [CheaperFee]( to calculate the minimum fee depending on the state of the mempool
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:10:38
If the cost (energy used) of mine a block is too low then there is no proof of work and the blockchain is no longer robust against attacks
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:01:16
You can use a web app I built to calculate your tx fees [cheaperfee.com](
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:27:23
You can also use a web app I built [CheaperFee](

Not everybody knows how to encrypt a file. But everybody knows how to write down a seed and keep it safe

@_date: 2017-12-12 20:56:44
Maybe this web app could help you 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:12:13
Thank you so much! Yes you are right. I have to make a video tutorial of how to set your custom transaction fee and how to check the size your transaction will have. And then embed it at the top of the web app

@_date: 2017-12-23 00:26:50
In a free market the price is just what people are willing to pay. So for most of them right now transact an amount of BTC for 30$ worth it. If almost nobody is willing to pay that fee, the demand would decrease and then the fee.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:35:14
The tool makes an estimation for the present based on the last hours state of the mempool. So it doesnt work for transactions in the past.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:01:40
In the meanwhile you can use this [web app]( I developed to calculate in an easy way the minimum fee you should pay
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:21:25
I dont get it
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:04:38
Next time I recommend you to use a web app I built in the last weeks
@_date: 2018-10-20 16:22:03
Fucking awesome
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:59:10
Wow and you didnt sell at any moment? 
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:48:58
TO HODL IS THE KEY OF LIFE
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:45:39
Only if everyboday wanted to sell

Every signal is a hodl signal
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:05:46
Coinbase is not a good wallet. Its an intuitive platform to buy btc, not to hodl them. 
@_date: 2018-10-28 22:51:32
Best joke ever
@_date: 2017-08-05 13:49:59
I like to hodl. Its like jerking and stop just before cumming, and keep jerking waiting for the big blast cum explosion. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:24:39
I bought at 2000€ :D
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:48:16
I cant see finding more gold in an asteroid :)
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:30:31
What if 100% of devs, nodes, community want it? 100% consensus?

If you place a limit order you are a maker. Period.
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:45:31
You have to have some bitcoins before using them....
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:46:32
You can buy btc on gdax with zero fees
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:30:33
I have just downvoted the app. It doesnt say anywhere that is for bcash and not for bitcoin -&gt; misleading -&gt; scam
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:16:29
Own a thing doesnt imply you can use it with freedom. Ethical right to private property and to freely act inside it or with it
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:42:17
Lol code can be edited man...
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:57:57
You cant find more gold than the total amount of gold on earth
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:12:55
Or not
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:26:52
Yes, and it would be also possible to increase the issue limit to 30.000.000 btc if there is consensus right? Not probable but posible, like find more gold in an asteroid...
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:56:23
And liberty
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:55:39
You dont understand bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:38:27

Dont switch to bitcoin please. The 'know how' is what make some people richier than other. The human capital, your knowledge, your capacity to serve well other people. This is how always will be with USD, EUR, BTC or whatever currency.

Democracy is a threat to liberty

Banned like drugs? Oh no! Nobody is getting high!
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:43:30
So you were right :)
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:52:35
It doesnt work for a decentralize system wich have to reward miners somehow to be robust.
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:34:36
You should investigate about cold storage, air gapping, offline transactions. Having that "clean" laptop connected to the internet is not safe. At least has your laptop linux installed and not windows?
@_date: 2018-02-24 01:14:30
Liberty for individuals. Democracy is the tyranny of the majority.
"...liberty of kinds that actually matter" Well, you know... Thats like your opinion man
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:52:03
Did you become a member of that asociation voluntarly? If not, that fee is theft.
And I can't stop paying taxes or I'll go to jail.

@_date: 2017-10-16 00:36:03
Do it with 10 merchants. 4 of them sell the btc? 6 of them hold it -&gt; Win. 8 of them sell the btc? 2 of them hold it -&gt; Win. All of them sell tha btc? -&gt; Even.
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:01:04
Could you tell us why? Are you suggesting that bitcoin was created with the support of big bankers?
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:51:18
Paper wallets dont have that problem and are free... Also with a hardware wallet you have to write down the seed on a paper and secure it. I dont see the point of buy hardware wallets...
@_date: 2017-10-17 08:37:57
Yeah maybe. But for long term storage? For long term buy a hardware wallet is a waste of money
@_date: 2017-09-10 22:19:13
Are you spaniard?
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:43:09
Because tax is theft and bitcoin allows you to not be stolen
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:44:10
Or not
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:06:29
Not at all, I cant leave home without walk the pedrastian public road
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:57:43
Enough time to get infected. If you want to do it right implement a cold storage in a linux distribution with air gapping using offline transactions to withdraw the btc when needed.
@_date: 2017-10-26 09:58:53
You can't destroy a protocol
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:32:06
Not at all.
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:47:47
With the money a hardware wallet costs, buy more bitcoins. Then put all the btcs on a bip38 paper wallet. Print multiple copies and give them to familiars and friends. Memorize the password perfectly.
Optimization broah
@_date: 2018-02-21 08:04:52
23$ for that watch is totally a scam. The background of the watch is painted. There arent real crono spheres. It worth 1 o 2$ as maximum value.

@_date: 2018-02-15 08:19:27
No, is the password to decrypt the private key.
To OP. I had a similar problem and I think it was related with the format of the private key. You should read the free online version of the book Mastering Bitcoin. There is a chapter about this. Good luck
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:02:50
Which bug?
@_date: 2017-10-26 09:11:30
Less steps. I would never buy an amazon gift card and then use it, but I would consider using bitcoin directly on amazon
