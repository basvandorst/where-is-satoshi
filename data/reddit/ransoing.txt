Nope. You would need to calculate fees per block over total bytes in the block. Or just go to the "fees" page on fork.lol.
Over the past 7 days, BTC has averaged 18.42 sat/b, and BCH has averaged 4.2 sat/b.

Maybe the central system's bandwidth is so lousy that it legitimately costs much more for the extra few bytes of data when you send larger amounts of $.

... And shortly before this transaction, someone moved 30,326 BTC for ~$20 worth of fees. Look at transaction
Still great, but much higher than $0.19

In order to spend coins, a transaction must include a reference to one or more previous transactions which show that the spending address actually has those coins available to spend.
The first transaction (which had a $20 fee) proved it had 30k BTC available by referencing a *few dozen* previous transactions. Then, shortly afterward, the address which received that 30k BTC sent it back to the first address, and the fee was minimal because it only had to reference a single transaction to prove that it had that amount available to spend.

Do people not realize that fees aren't based on the total amount you're moving? They're based on the byte size of the transaction, which is larger per BTC when your balance comes from many small transactions.
The transaction in the OP was only that cheap to make because that balance came from one single large transaction.

A more relevant metric is the minimum fee you can spend in order to get quickly confirmed. Have a look at [
At the time of this post, for BTC, a fee of 1-2 sat/b will get you confirmed within 5 blocks, and if you want to get confirmed in the next block, you'll need to spend 12 sat/b. Many wallets default to using the cheapest fee that will get the tx confirmed in the next block, so even if a cheaper fee is possible, most users end up paying higher fees, and many users aren't even able to control the fee rate.
Unfortunately, I can't find similar data for BCH, but my understanding is that the fee doesn't matter as long as it's &gt;= 1 sat/b since the mempool is cleared with each block.

Didn't know about [bitwage.com]( thanks, looks like a great service, but I'm imagining a society in which we've abandoned fiat and everyone uses Bitcoin, and I'm wondering how the technology would work for specific use cases.


Are you saying that LN will eventually support receiving transactions without an online node?

It's probably VISA charging bitpay the $5 fee, and bitpay passing that fee onto the users.
