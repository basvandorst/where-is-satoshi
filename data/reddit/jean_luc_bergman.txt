Lightning and big blocks is the only workable long term solution.
@_date: 2018-01-01 09:33:25
To transfer into a lightning channel still requires fees.  It still requires bigger blocks. With another doubling in users we'd be looking at $100 fees to do this.
If they're not interested in price then people will leave. No reason to stick around with a coin that is happy to lose me money and with developers who aren't interested in the user experience and desires of low fees and reasonable tx times.
16mb blocks would cut out almost no one, and the idea that in 2018 people can't handle the bandwith and upload speed requirements of 16mb blocks in is utterly ludicrous, and quite frankly, an outright lie.
Pathetic. Move to bigger blocks or this coin is done for.

"I didn't know a degree could major in anything... is... is your degree studying corporate finance? Is that possible?"
1. A degree can have a major in a variety of things. Every time I bring this up to people I have idiots like yourself question it, but there you go. 
2. No it isn't a masters, it is a bachelors.
3. Where did I suggest I didn't know the difference between banking and investing? You're making that up.
4. Like I said, I went to a top 100 university in the world judged by a variety of rank lists, and an Australian university. "why nobody is hiring you to do their books." I said corporate finance, not accounting fuckwit. You critique me as if I don't know what I'm talking about when you make it clear you don't. I also have made more than 5 years of an average finance salary in crypto this year, graduated a month ago and haven't gone for interviews yet.
5. I know how diversification works, intelligent and active institutional investors are more concerned with risk/return than diversification for the sake of it. 
"owning Bitcoin and Ethereum isn't diversification"
Yes it is. That is like saying owning Apple and Google stocks rather than just Apple stocks isn't diversification because they're all stocks.
I pardon you for being skeptical, I don't pardon you for being a fucking moron.

No I think the hostility is warranted. We all want a scalable bitcoin that is mass adopted, is fast, cheap and continues to appreciate in value. That cannot happen without a significant blocksize increase.
If shitbag, disgusting core devs want to drag btc through the mud then they deserve every last criticism and attack they get and more.
Very, very simple solution. Core should continue their pursuits in efficiency upgrades and second layer solutions, AND opt for a blocksize to make it competitive on-chain with bitcoin cash.
I don't want BTC to lose as it will hugely impact the market and destroy confidence in a very negative way, but until this cult realises that a blocksize increase is 100% necessary I will support BCH and the failure and collapse of BTC. I don't want it, but you're bringing it on yourselves.

Futures are contracts with an underlying asset. You agree to buy or sell a certain amount of something (stocks, commodities, whatever) on a date in the future at a price you agree to now. You are betting the movement in price between now and the contract date is favourable to you. If you are selling, you are betting the price will fall, so by setting a price now you will get more than whatever it will be worth on the day. If you are buying it is the opposite. You are betting the price will go up so you are locking in today's price. Often futures can involve leverage. So essentially contracts on the asset to buy or sell at a later date.
What does it mean for bitcoin? It means institutional investors that are attracted to these products for hedging ability (using financial instruments to offset risk of negative price movements) now have a simple means of betting on a price decline, and also hedging their exposure in the sector.  Previously the ability the hedge against rises and profit on falls was not widely available in a format pleasing to institutional investors.
Will it make a big difference to price movements when it starts trading? I don't have any idea, and I don't think anyone else does either. Typically futures don't drive or effect prices of the raw asset that underlies them, but the fact that it offers institutions an easier means of shorting (betting on a fall) is perhaps a net negative.

I am a finance grad with experience in them too, but I don't necessarily think it's fair to call it a net negative or positive. The opposite of your example is also possible.
I agree it's something to watch though, certainly not a good thing but ultimately inevitable as in market cap terms it moves to an established asset class level.

No its no sad it means that competition will result in better service for users. Is it sad that bitcoin will need big blocks to compete? Are low fees and fast transaction times on chain sad? 
No, we need a workable bitcoin that is suitable for mass adoption, and currently that is looking like bitcoin cash. I would much prefer BTC succeed but that is only possible if it moves to substantially bigger blocks in addition to second layer solutions and on-chain efficiency improvements.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:56:28
I agree this was totally wrong of him. The bitcoin cash and blocksize issue is another animal entirely though.  Doesn't change the fact that his camp is offering competition and legitimate solutions to the scaling debate, while bitcoin is left in the dust as completely unusable as a generalised transaction coin for the masses.
We all want the price to increase, and we all want mass adoption. We cannot have that with ever increasing fees that are regularly over the $10 mark for a 10 hour transaction.

I agree. 8mb would remove almost nobodies capacity to run a note and would remove the point of Bitcoin Cash however so is a reasonable number. Bitcoin Cash deserves life if anything for this competition to scare core developers into saving BTC with a blocksize increase before it is too late.
The FUD here is caused by core themselves. No one else to blame. We can't stay at 1mb for ever and still manage to survive in the longer term.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:46:06
Segwit has achieved almost nothing in the short term. I agree it was a strong step in the right direction, however a blocksize increase is necessary to fix the current problems TODAY, not accepting 18 months of hell for this coin.
Are the current fees and wait times honestly sustainable to you? Get real, they aren't possible for mass market useage, and people will look to better options.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:23:10
We don't need to scale on chain to the level of Visa. We need an appropriate on-chain scaling roadmap for reasonable fees and sending times that appease the average user and encourage mass adoption, as well as potential second layer solutions. 
This BCH fiasco wouldn't have happened if Core were interested in a reasonable on-chain scaling solution for the short term. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:01:22
Because is a fork of an almost identical chain. It ought to have the bitcoin name. If you want the fighting to stop, convince core to opt for a sensible block size increase, like to 16 mb. Aid short term scalability, and kill bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:23:02
All of this is fine, but 12 months to get beyond 10 USD transaction fees, half a day to transact, 150k unconfirmed transactions on the blockchain and BCH shitcoin eating up 10% of market cap is NOT acceptable no matter how you look at it.
I agree it isn't a workable or desirable long term solution to scale on-chain, but we could remove 90% of the current complaints with what would likely be a 10% decrease in decentralisation with a move to 8mb blocks. There is CLEARLY a very large short term issue here, and it requires a workable short term solution. Right now we have a coin that is simply broken.
As a precusor to 2nd layer solutions segwit is fine progress, but it has been a failure if we compare it to an actual block size increase in the short term.

Today has shown me who the real cult members are, and it isn't Ver and Co. Make core take responsibility. They have lost over 10% market share to BCH in a single day and upset half the userbase. We aren't at the point of a workable layer 2 solution, right now we have NOTHING. We have a SHITCOIN with an impotent dev team and cult members like you dragging it through the mud.

@_date: 2017-11-12 16:07:02
They're losing the trust and respect of the market by not addressing on-chain scaling issues. We don't have accessible 2nd layer solutions ready, or a release date. Right now we have an unusable shitcoin that could be fixed for the forseeable future with nothing else but a move to 16mb blocks.
I WANT BTC to win. I just think people here are insane after today to not see the threat of competition that are far more willing to provide what the userbase want.  
With 172k unconfirmed transactions, close to $10 fees, a day for a transactions to occur, and a legitimately large chunk of the market cap eaten up by BCH it's time to stop calling the developers "good" just for the sake of it. I don't care how good they are, they deserve the boot if they aren't prepared to fix current problems CURRENTLY rather than waiting for lightning rollout in a year or two.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:59:05
Anything under 16mb blocks would objectively have no impact on centralisation.  Suggesting otherwise is white noise.

@_date: 2017-09-24 09:14:32
The problem Ratio is that your solutions typically involved more tax, less free market and more government. I'd be fine if your plan didn't involve massive subsidies, regulation in your favour and doubling energy costs for the general population, but that is never the case.
If you can't solve it with free market, your product isn't good enough.
@_date: 2017-09-24 17:29:49
The difference is crypto already has a product and a multi-trillion dollar use-case unlike tech startups in hot industries. It is a poor comparison. 
Volatility is not a risk regarding fundamentals, it regards time. If your investment horizon on crypto is longer than a year and you will not need the cash anytime soon, volatility is not a risk. This is basic finance. The trend, user base and use case are what is important.
@_date: 2017-09-24 18:59:43

"If Bitcoin goes 25x.... to around a trillion valuation, it will be have global assets comparable one single modern U.S. bank (of the thousands of banks), and its biggest onramp provider, Coinbase, will be half as big as one single low-valued processor (of the thousands of processors)."
This is completely false. 25x would put it well over two trillion. Do you understand basic maths?
"Bitcoin doesn't has a "market cap" - it has "total value of customer deposits". The market cap is the sum total of the market capitalization of the service providers, which, right now, is probably less than 3 billion."
No, the market cap is the total sum of the value of each coin. People use the same approach when discussing the gold market cap, or other currency market caps. Take a basic course in finance or economics, you seem to just be making things up.
The gist of what you are saying is true, but try learning basic maths and making false claims about objective definitions before embarrassing yourself on the internet again. Idiots and stupid posts like this give Bitcoin a bad name.
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:01:57
No but it is a common measurement used for equities, currency, various store of value assets and securities in general. 
I appreciate what you're saying that it doesn't indicate a zero-sum metric for showing how much money is flowing into or out of crypto-currency, but this problem also exists for stock valuations too. It is just a standard, basic financial measurement.
Your point makes sense, but you can't change the definition of market cap on a whim. The metric you are trying to claim we should apply is also much harder to quantify and harder to interpret.
I agree it is certainly worth considering this when measuring the potential value of the market.

"Good investments have very low volatility, risk, and steady returns."
Typically this is correct. However not in all circumstances. You are thinking with typical finance school analysis, good for asset classes with long term historical data and understanding to apply valuation and predict trends, but not necessarily good for crypto.
The bubble talk is again ludicrous, the dotcom bubble was for 10 trillion in today's dollar terms and crypto is worth 150b. The market caps are not even remotely equivalent.
You won't be convinced either way and again whether crypto investment is worthwhile depends on portfolio structure, risk profile and investment period, so it isn't for everyone but as someone who works in finance I can't see a better opportunity for a 5 year investment return at this risk level, which I see as similar to typical small cap indexes assuming 10x returns.

I mean if you're a fucking retard and keep 3m in fiat at 65 and don't have any invested then yeah maybe you need that much, if you're a decent investor it is around 500k if you don't have dependents and already have a house.
Of course by the time I am 65 the inflation would have massively devalued the dollar so maybe the number would be 3m, but at the same time my property will probably be worth more than 4-5 mil in 30 years.

Point me to those 50x upside potential investment opportunities that have a workable product and community that supports them. To suggest mid-risk microcaps with this potential exist and are visible everywhere is ludicrous. Fucking insane and if it was true you'd be a billionaire. Comparing bitcoin to a random startup without a product is simply retarded.
For the past 4 years Bitcoin has gone straight up and by hundreds of percent while the market cap is still small, and use-case value is significantly higher. Volatility risk over the 3-5 year span which is the investment period advocated by most investment managers is extremely low.
I agree the number you put for a crypto market cap of 5-10 trillion is over ambitious, but 1-2 certainly isn't. Either way, 150bish is still extremely low with a massive upside.
Also gold isn't a decade long bear market. It was a 4 year bear market from 11-15, but 7-11 and 15-17 a bull market by any stretch if we are looking at what is considered the numbers of equity "bull" markets.
"Thats a huge risk. Dismiss it however you will. But if you think, for any reason, investing in an asset which threatens every nation state on earth, if it reaches your target prices, is a good idea, you're not a good investor. Maybe a good gambler."
This same argument was made about the internet, the fact that crypto offers the potential to do this and do it efficiently with better scaling solutions is enough to convince one to invest.

Well risk management is everything, and of course diversification is key. I'm mainly invested in equities   (mostly through indexes) and property, but the risk/reward is such that every rational investor should have at least a 3-5% initial investment of their net worth in cryptocurrency.
By market cap and network compared to its usefulness, crypto is still in baby stages.

I don't even think 100k is unreasonable tbh. Virtually guaranteed in the next 5 years.

The market caps we're dealing with are no where near compatible and the question of use-case for crypto is drastically different than the tech stocks. Not even remotely similar situations.

Why should government steal from me and double my energy prices to pay for people who aren't born yet for a purpose that lacks conclusive evidence either way or legitimate cost/benefit analysis?
Most importantly though, climate cultists tend to make the assumption that if only the USA did something about it the problem would be fixed. China is poised to double emissions over the next two decades and India triple. This is under the useless Paris agreement. So the better question is why should the USA do something about it which will make them less economically competitive than they already are to virtue signal within a problem the rest of the world isn't set on fixing? The meteor scenario doesn't make sense as an equivalence as in this case the rest of the world isn't set on spending that money. 
The problem also isn't even close to a meteor, and climate scientists are effectively extrapolating long term trends from one hundred years of data. Their predictions in the short term have proven to be dog shit.

If anyone is looking for more fud, my friend is family with the Dow Chemical CEO Andrew Liveris and apparently he said Bitcoin was "like tulips" at dinner

Any amount is worth it but like that guy said if 60k is a fair marker as if the crypto market his around 5 tril (so about half the gold market) so that would be like a 23x increase from now, which would get you over a million so you could comfortably retire. 
Anything is good, but don't pretend $400 is going to change your life.

Yeah how the fuck does a guy with over 100 million in BTC wear suits that look like they're from mens warehouse? Da fuk?

Those who held after the crash still outperformed the Dow and SnP500.

100k USD is moon. Enough that I can retire before my mid twenties.

Disastrous American economy with out of control debt. Crypto is the only viable exit strategy. Even without massive scaling improvements, as a store of value with potential to go mainstream under a crisis it is without parallel.

"and not one with huge marginal advantages to fiat currency to the vast majority of consumers."
All investment and retirement funds are entirely built around beating inflation. The benefits of bitcoin with reference to inflatable fiat are valid for EVERYONE.

Crypto already paid a deposit+taxes on an 800k melbourne townhouse I'm happy with long term, interest + misc housing expenses around 25k after renting out one room. General expenses of travel, living and fun around 25k a year.
Spread across a good active managed fund + crypto I'd expect 10-15% returns long term so at about 750k it would pay 75-100k a year which pays expenses with 25-50k savings each year, so I'd say that was around the mark. Even with 500k that would probably be enough and I'd just cut back expenses.

Not really, my point is that in 44 years a house worth 800k now would be worth 4-5 m due to inflation. Not hard to understand. 
My property was bought at 90% leverage too, which is what smart people do.
If you're smart financially, have even a minimum wage job and buy a house in a good area with high capital gains + have 5 btc (and a diversified portfolio of other crypto) in 5-10 years you will be set.

"speculative buying from people that are looking for a profit "
You mean like literally every investor. You mean like the stock market.
"rather than to utilize the currency as you described"
It's not a currency you fucking idiot, It's a store of value, THAT is the defining feature of crypto over fiat, however as the payment system develops it may be able to function as a currency
"I think that most of the crypto trading volume today is just that - trading"
Nope, just people who don't want to stick their money in a bank for 1% interest when inflation is at 2%, and real inflation is closer to 5% in major cities where people actually want to live.
"Most of the traders have no desire to transact in the currency that they purchased."
That doesn't diminish its worth. It doesn't need to be a "currency" to have value. Listen to the Novogratz interview, you're getting bogged down in irrelevant terminology. 
Your mind is very simplistic. Anyway, have a nice life, there is more than one way to skin a cat and I'm sure you'll be fine whatever else you're involved in.

This doesn't make sense. They potentially WOULD look for an OTC buyer or do slow laddered orders that consider market liquidity rather than dumping amounts all at once that the market can't handle, particularly if it is going to effect the price to an extent they will be forced into selling at lower and lower prices, like in this situation.
The premise of your argument doesn't make sense.  Yes this is something the market should accept in terms of potential risks, but from the perspective of both the liquidator trying to get "the highest possible prices" and the market itself it just shows incompetence.
