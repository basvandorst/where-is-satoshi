Bitcoins Eternal September?
You would need to keep them down for two weeks. And there are watchtowers so you would need to keep all those down too.

Is open interest how much they should have in custody for physically delivered bakkt futures?
@_date: 2019-11-06 18:02:37
How much is in their custody now?
@_date: 2019-11-09 15:24:58
How many futures have been delivered in total? How much is in their custody?
Or is it just one coin being traded back and forth to create fake volume?

Where do I see that?

Because you can use a HW wallet with Electrum?

At least P2WSH is backwards compatible and even if it does not save as much as Bech32 it is better than legacy and we can start using it now instead of being at 35% SegWit usage. I don’t think bisq will start generating Bech32 deposit addresses until all exchanges, bitcoin ATM, wallets support sending to it.
Electrum supports both, but I think they started with Bech32 and did P2WSH later, maybe BitcoinJ will follow that approach.

From the article
”The fund automatically allocates crypto distributions based on their performance in market cap rankings. When you buy the stock, market makers buy the equivalent amount of cryptos – according to the distribution – and send it to a custodian for safe keeping.”

Of course there will be stuck transactions if the blocks are full. If everyone pays 0.1 BTC per KB for their transactions does not mean that everyone will get confirmed.

Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Bisq, Gemini and Localbitcoins.com
These can’t even send to Bech32 addresses!
@_date: 2019-01-31 04:56:03
Does the article say that they used bitcoin?

At least they let you withdrew your bitcoins, good guys!

What wrong did Mycelium do?
@_date: 2019-01-14 01:47:44
1. I didn’t fall for any ico but I see your point.
2. Still faster than bitstamp, bitfinex, lbc, gemini
3. The only thing you can do with bcash in Mycelium is exchange it for BTC, there is no other bcash functionality. How is that a bad thing?

They support it while Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Bisq, Gemini and Localbitcoins don’t.

What is it about SegWit that Coinbase does not support?

Like the article says
“subject to the nod of approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)”
Why do you think it will be approved?
@_date: 2018-12-01 02:53:42
Still pending regulatory approval.
