How fast? I want to set a reminder.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:18:07
Thanks, actually this might be the first comment with real arguments.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:25:58
Thank you.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:25:48
Thank you so much for taking the time to write this. I was expecting the downvotes, since this is afterall. But was hoping for comments like yours. Your arguments make lots of sense, and I needed a reminder.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:12:12


No, I was just trying to convey that arguments on all angles are against bitcoin. Not really, but this idea to sell btc for something else has been creeping up on me, so I made this post as I really don't want to.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:07:34
No offence, I want to believe, but I made this post to hear some arguments. Just saying "bitcoin wil stay  is not an argument. LN will make it fast, but we're still a long way into adopting it, and other coins do what LN promises to. I really want to stay with bitcoin, as it's my first love. But I was hoping for some real arguments.

I decided to do it. Not saying you should. Only invest what you can lose is the best saying. I decided to gamble one year’s worth of savings. Worst case I lose it all, best case it changes my life. I gambled before and it didn’t pay out but I don’t regret it. But will never gamble so much that my family is at risk. The more I read into bitcoin the more I trust it to go somewhere. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:53:52
I know there was a time when bitcoin dropped 87% in value over the course of a year. Is the reason known? I was not involved in bitcoin back then.

Sa zicem ca vrei sa cumperi BTC de 1000 RON. Inseamna ca trebuie sa transferi 1000 RON la un exchange, si ala iti transfera BTC in wallet de ei.
Daca folosesti un exchange din romania aia iti dau un cont de Ron unde sa transferi. Cu un exchange din state iti dau un cont de USD din state unde sa bagi banii. Care din cele doua transferuri crezi ca se face mai rapid si te costa mai putin in taxe?
Dupa care BTC poti sa ii primesti intr un wallet deschis de tine, sau poti sa ii tii pe un wallet pus la dispozitie de acel exchange. Nu e recomandat sa tii la ei, ca daca dau faliment sau sunt hackeriti, pierzi tot. Au fost cazuri. Daca totusi vrei sa tii la ei poate te simti mai in siguranta cu un exhange din state cu 100 de angajati decat un exchange roman facut de 3 pustani.
Eu recomand Coinflux de la noi, ca fac rapid si nu am avut probleme, review uri bune. BTC nu ii tin la ei, ci ii tin intr un wallet deschis de mine, cu applicatia Jaxx. Dar pt ca am investit pe termen lung si nu intentionez sa tranzactionz des, am comandat un harware wallet, ledger nano s, o sa fie mai sigur.

Noob question : what is Segwit?

Is bitcoin banned in China? Or it was at some point? I’m new here, but I think I remember something.

Not yet.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:15:59
Is there no local exchange? Why do you want to use one from the states?
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:44:06
So a different solution to bitcoin’s scalability? Like Segwit?

Can someone make a tl;dr for us at work please?
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:41:44
E ok oricum vrei. Poti in ambele cazuri sa vezi cat te costa inainte sa transferi banii. Practic cursul USD la BTC. Decizi unde e mai ok.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:33:13
Rooky mistake.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:06:35
It’s like that time when me and my friends got busted doing something bad and we all agreed to deny it, since it was the only way we were going down. They asked me to deny it no mather what. And they went ahead and confess everything. I was last, so I thought they kept their word, so i kept denying it. I got all the punishment, they got nothing.

Was there a hard fork recently (last week)? Does that mean I have coins to collect? If yes, how?
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:45:11
ETH is pretty popular too. It tries to be something different. Go to their sub and read about it and watch some clips, it’s worth it.

OP has no idea how futures work. How is this post getting upvotes? Sometimes this sub feels like a huge circle jerk. As long as there is a “don’t sell” message it does’t matter what horse crap is said.

Thanks. I’m not discussing it with anyone, just myself. I like balanced opinions, but not sure where to get it, since the front page of this sub only is of course not a good source. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:33:05
Nu baga decat ce esti dispus sa pierzi. Nu stie nimeni ce va fi, e prea volatil ca sa zica cineva sigur ce va fi. Poate se intampla ceva maine si pierzi tot. Poate ajunge la 100K pana la sf lui 2020. Daca bagi, baga pe termen lung, pt cativa ani, si fara sa te sperii si sa vinzi in caz ca o ia in jos. In 2013 a avut o scadere de 87% pe timp de un an. Cum ar fi daca ar scadea acum de la 12K la 1K ? Dar apoi peste cativa ani a crescut cu 600%. Cum ar fi sa creasca de la 12K la 100K? Eu am bagat, si urmaresc zilnic progresul, dar orice ar fi nu ma ating de ei timp de cativa ani.

I bet you would have said the same about btc being 10k if you wrote 5 years ago. Let’s not act like we know everything. Or you might end up eating your left nut.

How did bitcoin first start worth something? I mean, the system was created, people started using it, but in the end they are just numbers in a network. Someone had to decide “hey i’m accepting these numbers in exchange for goods”. How did it all start? I’m just curious like that.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:13:18
The only acceptable anwer is that no one knows. We can all speculate but no one can predict the market.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:34:47
This is the kind of post I come to this sub for. Not the usual hodl circle jerk. Thanks for writing this.
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:47:24
Crypto is getting too big not to get goverments attention. And that’s ok, they are supposed to notice, and to start discussing about it. It’s even ok to regulate it up to some point. What’s not ok is if they decide to ban it, or regulate it in absurd ways. Until that happens, them talking about it is exposure, which is good for us.

I’m from Romania too. I buy locally because there are less fees and the transfer is much faster. Either way I’m not keeping them with the exchange, I have my own wallet. So there are no pluses to buy from an US exchange.

Noob question: Why are so many people using Coinbase? 
1. For purchasing it doesn't seem good as there are other places to buy bitcon with less fees. 
2. For storing I suspect everyone has their own wallet, not using Coinbase wallet (since I see it not recommended anywhere).
What am I missing?
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:41:48
Thanks, this helped.
One more thing please, what does this mean from the wiki, and does it make these devices bad then?
