We're in The Guardian ? Awesome !!!
This is funny hahaha
"...while "Booze4Bitcoin" offers a range of alcoholic beverages packaged, for some unknown reason, like high-end shampoos, in flavours including "tea bitter", "citrus" and "outlaw". The last, at 72% alcohol, could come in especially handy when you just want to get drunk enough to forget moving to Lithuania." - The Guardian

Ouch, sorry about that, we have that user-friendly "minimalistic design" site. What should we improve?
Note that we're licensed and approved BitPay merchant.

Stephen, yes we can include NEFT in our next selection update. We'll notify you. We like that NEFT is also supporting Bitcoin.

Good points above ! Thank you. We registered domain with NameCheap ~3month ago(with BTC), and after few days we announced our launch. If I recall correctly, that option about "hide domain registrant" was default and for free back then.
Yes, we must update shipping info, contact info and TOS as soon as possible... like yesterday. Lot of people are asking us questions about shipping etc., this could save for us and for our potential customers a lot of time. Also it could add some credibility for booze4bitcoin site. But we hope, as time goes, that some feedbacks from satisfied customers will do a job done. Its long way before us and we understand that building a trust is not easy thing to do.
About that "You are way below market price." If you think about prices... its because we are wholesaler, we're able to offer this low prices ... but shipping fees are another story.

??? not all BitPay merchants are automatically listed in BitPay merchant directory, its new thing and seems like listing is voluntary. I checked that "Yes, list me in the Directory" just now, you should see us in directory soon. Meanwhile if it helps here's a screenshot :

Goods that have been produced in the EU, or that have been imported into an EU country with duty paid, are ‘in free circulation’ within the EU. Customs duty is not payable on acquisitions (imports or purchases) of goods that are in free circulation. Nobody wants "fool the customs".

Dear Free__Will, thank you for your questions.
Shipping costs for orders under 2kg are : 5€ for Slovakia, 13€ for Czech Republic and 25€ for rest of the world.
Products are shipped in discrete box as a gift, customer doesn't need to pay import charges, when purchasing for personal usage.
For now we're offering only Tatratea products distilled in Slovakia. We're just gathering interest if we should add other products into our selection in near future.
Thank you

Dear colsatre, thank you for your opinion.
"Bitpay processes payments using the most secure payment network, Bitcoin. We have no plans to use any other payment network. We are often asked whether we will accept Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and even alternative digital currencies. These forms of payment are more vulnerable to various kinds of payment fraud and hence BitPay will not support them. Users can however convert various other kinds of assets into Bitcoin using the many Bitcoin exchanges that are available and then use those Bitcoins for purchases." - Bitpay

Dear wegwerfzwei, your concerns are on place. The verification of our Alcohol Distributor Licenses was part of verification process lead by Bitpay. We submitted all the necessary documents.
We're requesting information about age in order form and then verifying the age restrictions of destination country for each order.

Dear DeaDTerra, due to high shipping fees we decided that for opening day we'll be offering local distilled product. TATRATEA line catch our eye thanks to great variance of flavors &amp; ABV% &amp; modern design of bottle which greatly suits with Bitcoin and is also great as a souvenir or gift. The more will come.
