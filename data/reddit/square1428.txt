I would say eth has a chance to survive since there are so many crypto apps are building on top of it. Btc is really useless
Wait for a crash and get some eth maybe?

Congrats! On Venmo it took me 0.020s ! Those payment companies are soooooo dead

Bit coin price = arctanhx(5.28t-1029.34)+sinx(exp(997c-bt))
Where t is current time-20000101 , c is the speed of light and b is regression number from history. My model says b=3.1415926 
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:24:12
Of course. That is true for all cryptos
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:25:01
Or make bitcoin more useless
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:28:08

Is there any news that is bad to bitcoin? If not, why does the price keep falling?
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:29:59
Keep dreaming pls! And btc will go to $1
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:12:05
Nope 
Do something else and have a life
If possible, short it
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:14:28
That’s a good move. Btc is dying
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:30:16
150k plus 5-20% profit share would be a reasonable offer
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:06:49
Because the transaction fee is too high to arb the diff
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:25:03
Post your trade if you bought more. Otherwise no one believes
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:29:35
Most ppl here are bullshiting 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:34:39
Yes. Basically Coinbase provides a short term financing service. That’s partially why they charge you
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:10:13
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:38:31
If you have btc positions on multiple exchanges you can try to arb the diff. Ie buy low and sell high simultaneously, and then transfer. But this is not a good way to make profits given the jammed mempool
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:31:13
Nope, it is locked in at purchase
@_date: 2018-08-04 22:18:53
What a loser
$3500 car show off?
May daily income is more than that
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:46:08
U must be very rich! Idiots 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:47:57
Bond market is also falling! Bond price is INVERSELY correlated to yield
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:05:53
They want to share their happiness with you idiots

Liquidity is gone. Sharks need to lure more fishs so they can dump their shitcoins
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:13:56
Smart guys already cashed out and enjoying their rich life now. Poor guys like you bought btc  and day dreaming to be millionaires
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:05:35
It’s a way to detect hidden liquidity
Algo traders use that a lot
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:04:11
Must be Feb 30 2018!!!
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:32:16
Who the fuck are buying??? Are they nuts?
