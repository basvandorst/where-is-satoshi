Why was this guy butthurt though? 
@_date: 2018-09-07 10:50:39
I'm sort of a noob about blockchain so what's so special about blockchcain? 
@_date: 2018-09-05 08:16:32
Some guy said that Bitcoin isn't that very helpful in Venezuela, what should I tell him? I mean, I have 2 friends there who are using Paxful to trade for more value of money. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 09:27:19
Any link or know what it was confiscated? I'm guessing it's either not registered or it's an atm placed to phish for users information and funds. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 05:54:42
Coz it gives everyone a chance from being unbanked to be banked, not only speaking for the US but for other countries in Africa. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 05:57:51
Well, cryptocurrency was life changing for some right? How bout you, did you get into bitcoin as well? But, at least you saying that you're coming from the trade floor at least this isn't a lie of what you're saying. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 09:23:44
Well localbitcoins had the kyc implemented and it was a shitstorm for some users, meanwhile Paxful doesn't have any kyc yet they are able to cointain the platform, yes each of these platforms have scammers but, just imagine.. Lbc has kyc and still have scammers swarm the site. Let that sink in..
@_date: 2018-09-27 06:49:14
Wouldn't expect my comment would create such debate between users lol! No hate on me though guys, it's my super honest opinion. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 06:28:53
Are they gonna end up like Venezuela too? Or are they like that but, only a few knows and hasn't been mentioned much on media?
@_date: 2018-09-26 07:51:52
Well, banning ICO's completely is okay for me, most ICO's are typically just after your money and no returns happen, not much of the created ICO's do. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 09:11:24
Typical Americans always trying to insert the word "Terrorist/s". 
@_date: 2018-09-24 04:12:35
Well everything will be transacted to bitcoin someday, happy to see posts like these. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 08:05:22
Oh, well I thought they were actually rooting for cryptocurrency to enter their country as it can be a source of help or contingency plan.
@_date: 2018-09-19 08:05:30
No shit dude, it says "REDDITOR FOR 1 WEEK" lol. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 10:32:29
I get it, so bitcoins does help although it couldn't be a solid backup plan for daily living use, right? 
@_date: 2018-09-27 09:36:14
So, what is swish and where is the rest of the video? 
@_date: 2018-09-14 08:58:04
# Or maybe released too early? lol
@_date: 2018-09-05 08:38:02
I see because your caption says "that's why WE need Bitcoin" sorry if I misunderstood. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 06:34:11
It's not and it's not too late to learn how cryptocurrency works. If you plan on starting, easiest way is just to sell your gift cards (itunes gift cards, amazong gift cards) for bitcoin on p2p platforms. Easy. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 09:11:21
Cryptocurrency will be the future of currency.  Who knows, right? What if someday creating bills will be obsolete and everything will be digital, although there will be lots of security risks but as humans, I know we will find ways to make it easier for everyone. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 08:57:35
Nice, did they overhaul support staff process too? 
@_date: 2018-09-28 07:26:16
I don't know any either, hope someone will recommend any. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 08:37:12
That's pretty crazy but how come authorities would take your belongings? It's your own property after all. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 04:06:14
Wow, this is cool! I mean it's a source companies could look into and focus on the specific countries for marketing strategy. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 08:08:05
Paxful has offers for Greendot Prepaid Card although they don't for for GoBank BUT, you can leave a suggestion for them to put that type of offer. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 10:58:39
The grammar made my nose bleed, what is this? A scam? 
@_date: 2018-09-26 07:47:44
Well, this is not impossible, it could actually happen although the value of cryptocurrency won't be special anymore if they do plan to expand how much there are in this world. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 04:24:09
Cool! Lots of amazing people at these conferences, by any chance was Paxful there? Would want to know what plans they got since they overtook Localbitcoins in terms of trade volume.
@_date: 2018-09-05 08:20:57
If I may ask you a personal question, are you currently living in Venezuela right now? 
@_date: 2018-09-27 07:28:26
Got no idea, probably people who are not well aware of ICO's about its positive and negative features.
@_date: 2018-09-13 10:59:21
I thought most people in Wall Street hated Bitcoins or cryptocurrency since they see it as a threat. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 08:45:37
Get a hardware wallet, once you have a transaction have it transferred there immediately. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 07:18:36
Right, I was able to read some news back then that some wall street guys, like the higher ups saw Bitcoin or cryptocurrency, as a threat but, now they see what or how powerful this currency can be of help or make change in financial technology and mainly for finance worldwide. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 07:33:52
When the word "islamic" or "Islam" U.S will always be in the way for sure.  So busy looking for mistakes on other nations yet they can't look at theirs. ;) 
@_date: 2018-09-28 07:24:13
Cool! At least when I travel in any of these countries, I know that my bitcoin savings will be useful. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 07:37:06
True, there are scams, most of em, to the point that it's hard to believe new ICO's are not. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 09:33:05
Well, these countries I believe are happy to have cryptocurrency around and that's why it's good to have a company here or at least an existing company to branch out in the listed countries. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 09:25:30
One way to destroy your reputation.  - SEC 2018
@_date: 2018-09-28 07:12:27
So does this bank support both cash and bitcoin transactions under one account? 
@_date: 2018-09-10 09:26:30
Upvoted sire! HAHAHA! 
@_date: 2018-09-10 09:01:20
What's the catch with this? I mean is this like coinbase or like a peer to peer platform like Paxful? I can't see the site since it loads slow like how my grandma walks before she died. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 08:06:23
Don't get triggered on hired shills. Definitely not worth your time pal! 
@_date: 2018-08-27 09:22:14
I think you guys are right, decentralized exchanges are built to last, those exchanges whom are already held by their necks by the government will have a difficulty moving forward imo.
@_date: 2018-08-22 06:49:31
Fees are sort of high when it comes to btc atms though, but it's a good thing Netherlands and other countries already embrace cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 09:21:17
So does that necessarily mean, cryptocurrency will help out Venezuela in hyper-inflating the Bolivar? 
@_date: 2018-08-02 09:17:55
yeah, although what do you think is their basis for that specific prediction? 
@_date: 2018-08-16 05:44:38
Well, they are centralised after all. Though why Coinbase? 
@_date: 2018-08-02 08:13:15
Well right now it's having the dip phase so we don't really know how low or high this will get although, if it reaches lower than 5k, they said it'll crash further. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 08:44:35
must be hella fast then huh, and best thing here is, it's cheap. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 07:29:01
Probably not yet but, it does have a good effect on some of the countries that support crypto.
@_date: 2018-09-13 10:56:23
I think for me it was because of curiosity of what it was in its early days. How it gives people the freedom to earn bitcoins and turn them into money. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 04:32:19
You troll really bad.
@_date: 2018-08-24 06:46:06
Uhh, hasn't this been happening with other exchanges or peer to peer trading platforms? 
@_date: 2018-08-31 06:36:52


@_date: 2018-08-13 05:28:19
You got me at "women" haha! Although are crypto giants like Coinbase.. Paxful are having their hands on that country already? 
@_date: 2018-08-30 08:02:01
That depends, i'm sure each one of these investors have their own way of predicting and managing their funds on their respective places. Normally I would leave my bitcoins in my hardware wallet, some are on Bittmex but my process to earn more would be trading my gift cards on Paxful then transfer it on Bitmex. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 04:49:24
Well. It's individuals who create ICO's and all then end up scamming people. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 07:10:58
Sketchy link.. how legit is this? That when I click it, there won't be any phishing link nor malware that's gonna hit my pc? 
@_date: 2018-08-10 08:03:46
Cool! Didn't know lots of people are interested with crypto in Romania. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 07:06:12
The volatility and fluctuation is playing with my feelings. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 04:38:24
Uhh, you can use that to buy gift cards then have it sold for bitcoins and in return you get at least 30% more. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 06:24:07
So you're saying that cryptocurrency is actually bad for Turkey? 
@_date: 2018-08-17 10:14:12
Well, who is funding this lightning network though? I'm sure once this is out of beta phase, they will benefit from this a lot, not only them too but other users who will be joining in. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 10:00:34
What does Bobby Lee do everyday? Lol.
@_date: 2018-08-13 07:05:09
Lol, coz there are two ways you can try to understand this photo in my point of view. It's either a huge load of bitcoin is coming at us, or it's gonna drop so bad that we're gonna be all emotional and not hodl anymore. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 07:20:42
Isn't any form of hacking illegal? 
@_date: 2018-08-27 09:25:36
No hate but, some people told me that, they didn't want to invest in Bitcoin because it's something intangible or something you can't hold  unlike paper bills which gives some people that sceptical feeling. What do you guys think about that though? 
@_date: 2018-08-15 06:36:15
If you wanna try Paxful dude, it's not so bad. Quick way to sell bitcoin for cash. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 06:04:36


I see, since the last thing I remember, some dude here said that lightning network would make transactions cheaper and faster but, when you send out a large amount of funds, it becomes unstable. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 05:17:54
Wow, and this is Bobby Lee from MadTv? Never knew he was more capable then just making us laugh from Tv. lol
@_date: 2018-08-01 05:36:03
Soooo you are basing it on this Winklevii dude, correct? I don't really know this person, it its a person. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 08:07:54
It's not just this scam that happened, there was also Korea and Japan, not sure if it's the same day but man, these people fooled lots of people. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 09:34:05
This could be an advantage to them if they were to start a blockchain technology, since they do not have much access to credit facilities. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 09:31:28
how come I've only heard of this when it was created 2015.
@_date: 2018-08-17 10:16:18
I see, why i that so? And is it safe to click those links? Because I have never tried using lightning network. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 07:06:12
Must suck if we do reach that bottom mark, but hey it's volatility. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 08:00:09
Was able to read it, hope it'll be complete soon to help this kid out! 
@_date: 2018-08-23 07:34:07
Well you have a point, but it's actually okay for crypto to be around, individuals just needs to learn enough about it. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 05:31:07
I think this is where bitcoin comes in, to help out in terms of financing. This is close to what's happening to Venezuela so I wonder how people are dealing with these things on a daily basis. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 08:09:13
Got anything to back your statement up? Because from what I know, yes crypto is worldwide but not all countries support it. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 10:04:27
Ey man not me, i'm like way into this bitcoin shit, I was you know, out and asked my barber who's probably in his 60's and asked him bout what he thinks when it comes to cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 05:16:34
Yea, I think people who are sceptical just needs to be educated about it. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 06:47:32
People use bitcoins to margin trade or day trade using bitcoins, never heard of that? 
@_date: 2018-08-29 04:54:39
Well, we can't really say what will happen next but i'm just hoping for the best since I bought short .
@_date: 2018-08-28 05:39:53
I'm not gonna hype myself for this. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 06:47:47
Love how you troll, don't forget to take your meds. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 07:27:10
I hope this is not just a hype since he is one of the "first co-developers" of Satoshi. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 08:14:46
Why is that necessary though, there's tons of ways to keep your private keys for your own sake and not on some company.
@_date: 2018-08-09 08:20:12
When the government is part of something related to finance, things get fucked up. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 07:29:14
Well, hodling is a good thing but can be bad if you don't know how to read the chart/graph when to buy or sell and of course, when to hodl correctly. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 10:39:11
Typical poacher right here. I doubt this perfectly gets executed by your mods. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 08:06:18
Course, you shouldn't get your emotions involved when it comes to trading, always think strategically. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 07:22:08
bitch ass removed the link or was reported, right? 
@_date: 2018-08-28 05:41:41
You can't stay anonymous if they ask for requirements which includes your identity in it. Unless you go to an exchange  like Paxful where it's decentralized and has no kyc.
@_date: 2018-08-10 08:02:33
Where are you trying to get at here though? 
@_date: 2018-08-20 07:27:16
That depends on which platform you are on, though this is how I understood your question.
@_date: 2018-08-09 08:44:01
Probably the value depending on it's location? 
@_date: 2018-05-28 10:52:59
This sounds more of a movie streaming site with cam recorded movies from hollywood. What is this though?
@_date: 2018-08-17 10:57:01
I don't know man like, trust issues kick in when it comes to these links, i've been phished once so yeah. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:22:19
I see, why did they stop existing though, did they do anything illegal? 
@_date: 2018-08-20 07:12:43
Yup, plus localbitcoins sort of feels sketchy too.. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 07:17:54
Not sure but if source codes are different then I guess it can't happen at all. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 08:01:28
Never get your emotions mixed with trading either margin or day trading. Keep that in mind.
@_date: 2018-08-18 19:28:57
Well, that's Paxful man. Before you know it, they'll overthrow not just p2p platforms but other exchanges too. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 03:50:50
Something a hired shill would say, go away *fool.*
@_date: 2018-08-14 07:25:25
Whenever government get a hands on financial stuff, things happen.. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 08:24:27
Damn bro, why are you so mad? 
@_date: 2018-05-11 09:11:16
This could benefit Nigeria, from what I know they do not have a centralized database, now, if they are able to take advantage of the blockchain technology, they are able to have a unified database probably to create a ledger with legal documents of every citizen thus, using blockchain technology. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 09:42:25
Sorry but, what are these trading platforms? What do they specialize in? 
@_date: 2018-08-15 06:45:43
I'm in no position to say that this is good or this will benefit them but, I think this would be a "band-aid" solution.
@_date: 2018-05-29 07:00:49
I wonder where they are able to get these predictions, does it come by accurate analytics or maybe this comes in the experience they have had over the years spent learning and studying cryptocurrency? I wish I can learn more, if you got links please help me to learn, thanks! 
@_date: 2018-08-22 05:44:55
Run for 60k by the end of the year! Let's hope it increases for people like me who HODL and also trading gift cards for btc on Paxful. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 05:25:05
Haven't been very updated with Lightning network, last time I heard it wasn't safe, is it way better than that now? 
@_date: 2018-08-31 06:44:31
That's fine, I think their just doing this to create order. And if you're a decent citizen you have nothing to be afraid of where your money comes. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 05:25:15
China numba wan! 
@_date: 2018-08-15 06:50:40
I get the humor, lol! 
@_date: 2018-08-15 06:35:08
He could be right and it'll be appreciated by most that cryptocurrency exists to help or have it serve as a backup. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 10:52:21
No offense, this sounds like a scam. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 07:12:14
Hope people can help out with this project as it will be a good cause. Like seeing your money being used to help out others is wonderful! 
@_date: 2018-05-29 07:12:46
Why are they even trying to manipulate the price? Are they that greedy? 
@_date: 2018-08-23 07:25:00
Yup it's probably because of some manipulation going on in those companies. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 10:58:07
Where are your other post? You should try Paxful too, they're extending a lot for the Venezuelans to help out as well. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 07:09:45
Sounds like something that's already done, it hasn't even come close to "failing".
@_date: 2018-10-26 05:44:14
...And Roger Ver still pushing BCH :D 
@_date: 2018-10-03 16:28:04
I use Paxful for Steam codes, they got other cards too like PSN cards too in exchange for Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 11:48:07
Closest to free I know is using Paxful's affiliate program, register.. send invites to your friends, once they trade, you earn a percentage of what they've earned. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 05:17:44
Probably, lol! 
@_date: 2018-10-24 06:42:23
What about Paxful? It's also a decentralized p2p site wherein there's a lot of users using gift cards and bank transfer as payment method. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 06:17:15
I would totally agree about this, he thinks BCH is the way to go, sad af for those dudes he fooled. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 06:20:29
There must be a misunderstanding, I thought swish was a bank that both supports bitcoin and cash funds in one account. My bad! 
@_date: 2018-10-15 09:47:27
What would you actually recommend for a LN app? 
@_date: 2018-10-02 06:00:17
I hope there is, not only for Sweden but, globally too. Since I use paxful for btc and bank transfers it would come handy. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 10:13:39
Sucks that I'm not so updated like you guys, heck I haven't even travelled abroad yet. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 10:29:36
Nah, I normally would save at least 10 to 15% of my savings for Bitcoin, I promised myself never to go more than that. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 06:53:05
Woah, didn't  know LN is already implemented on other countries, last time I heard it wasn't that safe yet to use. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 10:08:18
I think you're getting it wrong dude.. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 10:16:14
This is it! By Tether, it's bad for bitcoin in the long run though. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 06:01:42
I think it's got lots of potential though. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 09:40:18
When is that going to be? Oh and one more thing, what is the difference between decentralized website and software? 
@_date: 2018-10-15 10:04:00
Probably unfroze accounts because tether bout to disappear like Thanos snap. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 08:17:31
Bisq has bad UI, lol! 
@_date: 2018-10-04 10:30:20
Well, it has been crawling up but it just crashes unlike how it was last year 2017 of the same month. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 04:44:07
I think recently Bisq released this DAO, compensating people, did you read that? 
@_date: 2018-10-05 10:09:04
How much are you willing to lose? This is the important factor dude, risk what you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 09:52:57
Well when it was on beta phase, maybe not using the word 'safe' but they said it was still unstable. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 09:51:41
That is actually true, I had a research about it. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 10:12:49
Have you seen it already? Cool right?! 
@_date: 2018-10-24 09:22:59
I think Africa is a good market, this gives people the chance from being unbanked to have countless opportunities to have money. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 05:40:35
What is the name of the platform? 
@_date: 2018-10-23 08:19:54
Most people who complain they are banned/ suspended on Paxful are people who technically scam people and are mad because they got caught. True story. I've been using Paxful since the beginning and never did anything wrong, main thing here? Read their FAQ's first before creating an account, most users just fuckin join in and think about getting rich while not knowing they are already ramming the platform's ToS, 
@_date: 2018-10-02 06:02:15
not a fan of reading, all I do is watch success stories in bitcoin stuff like Ray, the ceo of Paxful? Saw it through a channel called wethecryptos.
@_date: 2018-10-26 05:04:39
Aw man, they probably bribed them.. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 05:04:35
Go to the cops, they already fucked shit up anyway. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 10:12:12
man I know, coz from where I live, technology isn't very advanced, hope you don't judge me... 
@_date: 2018-10-05 10:14:04
why though, what do you mean? 
@_date: 2018-10-29 06:22:29
I don't use this wallet BUT if there is an option to setup a 2-Factor Authentication, you pretty much should have it now. It's important. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 12:28:03
Lots of factor actually does affect it's price volatility right? Like how it can be "manipulated" or it's supply and demand? 
@_date: 2018-10-31 09:52:04
Next to lbc is paxful, give it a shot! 
@_date: 2018-10-24 06:29:14
Same. 10 out of 10. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 07:58:00
Try getting in touch with the SEC? 
@_date: 2018-10-02 09:29:48
So after you bought it, there was no way you can trace it? 
@_date: 2018-10-15 11:40:24
usdt had something to do with btc spiking up hours ago for sure, but I think in the long run it wouldn't be good. 
@_date: 2018-10-30 12:29:18
\*grabs popcorn\* it begins here. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 12:32:01
That's trolling on a super high level. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 10:11:26
What i'm trying to say is that, I do know there are btc atm's around, a lot, globally.. but, I didn't expect LN existed in btc atm's already. 
@_date: 2018-10-30 12:52:49
Have you tried googling your question? 
@_date: 2018-10-09 08:12:29
Cool, sorry I'm not pretty updated on such news, thanks though. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 06:56:55
Aren't btc atm's in general have bad fees? 
@_date: 2018-06-25 05:29:46
Like some Robin Hood kind of thing.
@_date: 2018-06-21 06:20:59
I was able to read this since you both were just having a casual conversation under my comment and so far i've learned something. Thank you as well. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 05:00:51
Oh my, Poloniex back at it again, told some folks 6 months ago to get the fuck outta this site, no one listened. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 10:03:50
Welcome! Now I hope you can take the time to study cryptocurrency, as times there will be terms and discussions you might understand just like me, but now i'm still learning and using paxful since it has 300 options to buy. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 04:53:49
Does this have something to do with btc ending up in the 6k mark? Sheesh, though one guy said that by the end of the year he predicts it'll moon up to 60k, what do you think about that?
@_date: 2018-10-31 07:33:14
Course, can't I not ask the question I just did? I just basically asked since mine doesn't show, as far as I know only BitPay does. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 06:37:11
Cool! I never knew you can actually loan for Bitcoins, where do users mostly come from, and what are the purposes of them loaning for Bitcoins? 
@_date: 2018-06-29 08:13:28
The title says it all man, it's somewhat true. Banks somehow have a unfair system? This is just my opinion, while Bitcoin itself gives every human being a chance to support financial needs as long as they know how and in a legal process.
@_date: 2018-06-14 11:06:38
Lightning channel speeds up transaction process is that right? 
@_date: 2018-06-08 09:34:31
I think that they see potential in cryptocurrency, I just hope it hits moon again, been trading at paxful but it hasn't been much compared to how it was last december. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 06:06:28
Of course, these cryptocurrencies will survive all they can. Platforms will all be regulating one another, hopefully paxful doesn't since it has helped us Nigerians a lot, to give us a chance to earn money. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 09:40:50
Well, I was able to come across some article before wherein paxful built schools for nigeria, it's a good gesture, really. Specially coming out from their bitcoin funds, it's one of the first, and at least they give back what they earn and not just take people's money.
@_date: 2018-06-07 10:14:07
It's crazy how cryptocurrency experts always compare altcoins and bitcoin, that bitcoin will win or top every altcoin.. I just hope everything goes moon again so everyone has money, that's all. My paxful account has been hitting that low mark since the decrease of rate. But so far so good for me. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 08:06:03
Is it? I thought Remitano and Monero works fine there, plus they use paxful too since they have more payment options.
@_date: 2018-06-14 11:06:08
This is cool! Also paxful has this too, just gotta invite people and you earn btc. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 08:46:39
Try paxful, you have 300 ways to buy and sell your bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 04:28:20
So these exchanges I have mentioned above changed their banks to keep operating? 
@_date: 2018-06-28 06:34:48
Good luck, we can do this! Currently hodling all my funds in Paxful, where did you invest? 
@_date: 2018-06-08 09:19:44
Users had just been robbed by this, I think if you had a good blockchain network this wouldn't happen. You guys are holding people's money. For 3 years, in Nigeria I have been using paxful and this never happened. You need to give assurance to your users that it's always going to be safe, or at least return back all their money. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 09:27:03
Well there's lots of competitors in Asia already plus Uganda dominantly uses Paxful if i'm not mistaken..
@_date: 2018-06-07 10:38:32
So is inflation suppose to be a good thing or a bad thing? I'm sorry, still new to this. All I know is just trade and all and sell using p2p platforms like paxful..
@_date: 2018-06-20 09:53:36
I think it's the other way around. Hehe.
@_date: 2018-06-26 10:07:18
I believe so, if you do have spare money, why not? I've started the same thing myself, had myself $20 spare for that specific month and I tried to buy btc with paxful, ever since i've been using it, just a note, when you find yourself in a dispute they take days but it's assured that problem will be resolved. Best thing in that platform is the handful payment methods.
@_date: 2018-06-20 09:37:13
Actions like these makes international law for cryptocurrency much stricter and makes other countries skeptical about this technology. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 04:46:27
It is, plus 24/7 customer service works efficient. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 05:57:42
True, its all about the exchange and nothing for the users side. Besides, users are the reason why the exchange is running and earning.
@_date: 2018-06-20 09:34:06
This is absolute crazy, for sure prices will drop after this.. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 10:49:55
Well, will they really take the time to do so? I mean sharing what their project is, is like a leak of ideas I guess.. Good luck though! 
@_date: 2018-06-22 09:34:53
Blame bithumb's $30 mil hack, it caused the price to drop. :( 
@_date: 2018-06-22 06:08:56
God bless that guy man, he has helped a lot of people in the South African region, I hope the company won't stop helping others and giving back.
@_date: 2018-06-20 09:38:06
Paxful just needs your email and mobile number verified, providing your whole SSN is skeptical. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 09:21:46
Are they threatened by cryptocurrency since this competes with banks? I'm a noob here. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 09:35:47
1. Do not expect as it will disappoint you if it doesn't meet your expectations. 
2. Buy more bitcoin, learn how to read graph. 
Advice: If this is your only source of income, maybe work would be a nice idea. Then you earn a stable amount then buy more btc = increase your holdings. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 08:11:25
What is bisq? What type of platform is it? p2p trading? 
@_date: 2018-06-20 09:56:02
Wasn't really referring to Turkey but other countries banks seem threatened about cryptocurrency, well some. Just some countries but I think it should be embraced as it will help developing countries like Nigeria in limited financial options, when luno and paxful came along it was able to help them out. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 08:16:25
I think they really do in the first place since bitcoins or platforms have some decentralized system, or people are able to receive and sell money with less provisioned when it comes to identity.
@_date: 2018-06-06 09:51:47
That's how the rate is moving too. Lol! At least a p2p platform I use is keeping me on the edge.
@_date: 2018-06-21 09:12:59
This is a great vision actually,  to help Nigerians, they have a lot of potential and they should be given a helping hand to pursue what they want in life.
@_date: 2018-11-12 12:11:13
Replying to your update, they probably have seen this, some shills in the comments here. Lol! We know who you are. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 10:30:48
Paxful is known for using PayPal as payment method, but whichever platform it is, the risk of chargebacks with Paypal as your payment method will always be there. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 10:56:44
If you're still trying out a p2p platform asides from LBC, try Paxful instead. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 11:05:34
Search WeTheCryptos, tons of short videos that's easy to understand for cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 10:53:44
Haha coz they're sketchy right? They don't visualize their plans on social media, I mean like be user friendly and all. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:33:08
Loopholes? Probably LBC won't give a damn about coz they're rich af! 
@_date: 2018-11-05 07:40:48
Well that's kind of a big topic to talk about, others buy lambos with their crypto, countries like Venezuela uses crypto to buy basic commodity to survive on a daily basis. And the list goes on. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 06:11:11
I think this dude was naive.. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 10:49:03
Course Paxful has been acknowledge before, In a few years they're gonna take over localbitcoins once they get to other markets. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 12:24:11
Gonna try some of these apps and let's see! 
@_date: 2018-11-09 05:58:17
@_date: 2018-11-05 07:45:52


@_date: 2018-11-12 12:33:13
That's true, couldn't agree more, if you're expecting to get rich right now quickly, you should think again. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 09:53:22
You can give Paxful a try, you can purchase bitcoin of any fraction you want, no kyc and has 300 payment methods. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 08:54:49
I actually got my BCH back from the fork.. the split a year ago on Paxful and i'm gonna use it to invest! :) 
@_date: 2018-11-08 10:59:50
Maybe? But banks still have their purposes but who knows right, if crypto came first, i'm sure it would be imprinted onto people like how banks are to some people now. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 11:04:42
The word ex-cop reminds me of the movie don't breathe, lol! 
@_date: 2018-11-13 14:41:00
Yeah you're actually right about that. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 05:58:39
Why would you transfer that much... ON BITSTAMP.
@_date: 2018-11-14 06:14:22
It's always the scammers on every platform that ruins the name.. without these guys every platform will be good, though that's being naive. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 06:03:24
Looks nice to get printed on shirts or a mug, lol! 
@_date: 2018-11-16 08:51:59
Localbitcoins is full of shit.
@_date: 2018-11-13 14:40:38
Of course, what's the purpose if you don't.
@_date: 2018-11-15 11:26:43
Should I be sad or hopeful to buy? 
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:21:10
Hope p2p platforms will help this country more as having money is easier there. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:36:30
No kyc, you're underage, go to Paxful
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:18:14
That's even crazier.. fuckin polo. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 12:16:48
Or.. Paxful? 
@_date: 2018-11-04 23:17:00
Shots fired! People/ users always get on platforms, not only paxful, ends up getting scammed, blames the site, why? Doesn't read how things are suppose to work. Just simply registers, thinks of getting rich but doesn't actually think how to overcome challenges. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 08:36:21
Would actually agree on this,some banks are pretty much threatened by cryptocurrency to begin with. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 12:11:53
Always know what you're getting into first. Only risk what you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 11:26:41
This reminds me of the kind gesture Paxful had in Venezuela where they had some donations for the kids. Heartwarming.
@_date: 2018-11-04 23:09:57
bitusher, been seeing you say the same thing maybe you haven't really had a rundown or precise comparison with specific exchanges but, yeah you should pretty much try Paxful and see for yourself. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 06:54:59
Probably in a few years this will be normal news. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 10:30:56
So tempted to fuckin buy, what do you guys think??? 
@_date: 2018-11-09 05:55:48
What do you mean "use bots"?? 
@_date: 2018-11-06 04:09:27
If i'm not mistaken there are cafes where you can in the US. Some restos too but i've only read them and i'm not from the US so... if you are, maybe you can google em! :D 
@_date: 2018-11-16 09:20:28
Paypal is a good payment but, also risky too.. Risky because it has the highest chances of your buyer doing a chargeback if they are scammers.. Which you won't find out immediately. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 10:32:14
LAMBO MOON PARTY! 
@_date: 2018-11-14 06:05:31
Don't make deals off any platform you are using, it's dangerous as you can be scammed and have no proof, or have proof but the platform won't help you out.. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 08:34:23
Gift cards work best with Paxful in my opinion, it's really easy plus verification isn't difficult. 
@_date: 2018-07-13 07:29:31
I think he got some things confused with what he's talking about, please do correct me if i'm wrong with my opinion. lol.
@_date: 2018-07-31 08:17:52
I see, well, maybe they lack enlightenment, feel bad for some Indian users using Paxful, they do really good business there based on my trades with em. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 06:52:38
I see, wish Paxful could be introduced in the Philippines too so there would be more options for people to try and for bitcoin to bloom more. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 07:11:37
Started trading here last night, fucking amazing. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 08:00:53
How FREE is this? lol. It's scary when you say it's "Free" there might be a catch.. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 06:23:11
I think Paxful has an API stuff and so does other platforms which you are free to use. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 09:57:00
I can vouch for it, it's not. I've been using it for quite some time yet I can say only stupid people get scammed if you do not read how trade goes. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 07:40:16
LN intrigues me, whenever I see threads about it, I literally comment all questions and thoughts I can say/ask. Planning on using this but of course you gotta learn the basics, right? Thanks for explaining! 
@_date: 2018-07-24 06:40:14
Never heard of OpenDime, it sounds like a Pawnshop store. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 06:39:33
Kind of make sense but I do have a hardware wallet. I just haven't stored everything in my trezor. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 06:02:26
Absolutely, I hope Paxful will continue to do these gestures to help people out. You should use Paxful too, in a way when you invest in their platform, they earn and they use that to have these programs, so it's like you are also part of something big. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 06:24:10
Aren't some wall street people are like against bitcoins? 
@_date: 2018-07-03 06:56:14
All I know about this is, it speeds up transactions although it is a risky or an unstable technology which has to yet be fixed to a better version. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 09:03:25
How does the government handle these situations, specially the inflation rate? Also, are people somehow glad that cryptocurrency platforms like Paxful are extending their hands to help. 
@_date: 2018-07-13 07:34:29
Hey man, teach us some stuff you know about bitcoins! I keep my coins at Paxful, do you have any opinion bout that platform? 
@_date: 2018-07-23 06:04:37
Wished I was there for the actual event just to see how these kids are happy, some of us have great well off lives while these people are experiencing difficulties due to the absurd inflation rate. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 07:29:21
LN really does have a good potential for better transactions and cheaper too. It'll play or is playing a big role in cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 07:14:47
May I know where you are from? I believe platforms mainly must be specified from where users live also to know if it's supported from where you come from.
@_date: 2018-07-31 07:51:37
Yeap, we're all entitled to our opinions, bashing is not necessary unless your statement was too aggressive, anyhow, where do you earn your bitcoins? I earn mine on a p2p platform, Paxful, ever heard of it? 
@_date: 2018-07-13 07:27:03
Should I expect the value to increase now? 
@_date: 2018-07-04 04:36:59
I'll probably get at it on the weekends so I got lots of spare time to test it out and do more study about it. Since I got work on a daily basis plus I trade after work with Paxful, lol. Thank you very much for all these information. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 06:56:55
Bitconeeeeeect! Hey hey heeeeeey! That guy is a goner now, lol. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 07:08:32
What is leverage? Are you referring to the leverage function for BitMex? It seems fine as long as you know how to go about it. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 06:10:51
I think there's a way to accurately send out these Bitcoins by specifically for Venezuelans only. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 06:55:58
2018 hasn't ended yet, there can be so much potential for a bullish market or not, right? There's endless posibilities. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 07:24:27
Hi, I was able to send you a personal message, hope you can respond. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 07:20:26
Absolutely, I think some guys here just misunderstood you. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 05:41:44
Yea, currently experiencing that right now, it's a good thing my liquidation price is far from it. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 06:27:12
I've researched through localbitcoins, it seems like they do not progress that much anymore, they've been really quiet when platforms should always have something up to improve further. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 04:17:17
I see, well I think there are tutorials available online have you checked em already? 
@_date: 2018-07-12 03:33:50
I was asking, I think because they prefer banks and shit. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 07:06:33
That's what he said but, truth is there are lots of variations which can effect the value of bitcoin to increase or decrease and the good and bad thing is, no one really knows an accurate prediction and can explain why that's his/her prediction.
@_date: 2018-07-20 06:40:31
I guess? But it's a good thing they are helping this country. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 06:25:26
I see, so what is the most used platform? I heard some use [Coins.ph]( ? Does anyone use Paxful in the Philippines? 
@_date: 2018-07-23 07:11:55
You know what's Peer to peer? Paxful is. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 06:42:15
I'm only thinking of Airdrop as a way to give bitcoins to Venezuelans. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 08:08:35
Yeah was able to check it though but, I don't hear much about it. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 05:40:38
Currently drowning on Bitmex since I had a mistake buying long and had my leverage on x10, I think you can call me stupid. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 07:08:52
Destructive meaning, you can lose tons of money, am I right? 
@_date: 2018-07-31 06:52:52
Why would RBI not see the potential of cryptocurrency, who knows in a few years cryptocurrency might play a big role in terms of finance.. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 11:21:23
Hopefully Paxful would have its mobile application someday and have massive transfers from 300 payment options done without having to bring out your laptop or turning on your desktop. I'm sure users who've used Paxful for the longest time would love that. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 11:20:42
For sure, in the next following years these platforms would adapt more, improve more and I think banks would seem to be the last option in terms of finance now and they're gonna try to be on par with how crypto works. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 11:12:55
I think Paxful rates are high but you're gonna get something in return that's worth it. You get what you pay for after all. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:35:51
