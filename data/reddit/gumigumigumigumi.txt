Thank you! I think that the burden is biased towards some people after all, and like the list administrator, the shop owners will also disappear.

Thank you! I also think that coinmap is effective. And spendabit is famous in bitcoin-community, but I've doubt that people actually use it.
In my opinion, the effective method for the shop announcements is to create a channel on the media such as bitcoin news and magazines that people use on a daily basis. But bitcoiners will not accept it.
I understood by posting to reddit and bitcointalk that most bitcoiners disrespect the shop announcements.
I think the current situation is that the shops are bearing only disadvantages and risks. And I still can't see the future where Bitcoin is used in society widely.

Troll accepts speculation topics only, not real demand and creation's.
Bitcoin is a peer to peer electronic cash system.

thanks. comfortable for me.
Why do people in this subreddit hate the creations?  
Don't they want to spread bitcoin to society?
