It’s like you deposit money into there, and they make proxy credit cards that can have limits and be be deleted.

I would also be interested to hear

If I made an electrum walllet a month ago, is it likely to be a Segwit wallet?

I guess I said that a month ago too

Privacy.com might work, or use someone else’s credit card.

Alright, I’ll export to a offiline wallet, starting to use another exchange will work for me, I think kraken looks good as it has a large selection of alt coins.

A few weeks ago I bought bitcoin on coinbase. Should I export my bitcoin from there and start using a different exchange? Or should I sell and re buy from another exchange? Did they sell me bullshit bitcoin?

At least I’m in the 10 mBTC club

Alright I've been saying I'm going to do it for months now, today I'm finally going to go to the nearest ATM and do it.

Yeah but you’re not going to make a profit mining bitcoin on a GPU

Good explanation, I had not understood before reading this.

Planning on investing tomrrow while it's down, I want to be a part of this.
@_date: 2017-06-20 04:51:51
And how do they plan to do that? I don't tell them about it, how are they to find out that I secretly have bitcoin at home. If I live in Canada and come into the U.S. they can't just go and verify that I don't have bitcoin at home.
@_date: 2017-06-20 04:54:10
I feel like they don't understand how this works.

It would be something new, no one would see it coming.
