The info is legit. The way you write and the way you've sat on this wallet like a hermit waiting for movement is sketchy.

Propaganda is meant to deceive. I feel this is a scare campaign hoping the general public has no real understanding of energy usage. "Oh wow all electic cars? That's a lot!" Despite electric cars only making up 1.5 - 2% of car sales in the US.

Well considering the MSM on both sides has had a large amount of fake news, I don't see how that is a partisan issue. Calling it Alt right seems like a blanket claim to push a specific view.

How is this alt right

I think you're missing a comma
Im not saying all MSM is fake news, but there have been definite cases of it on both sides. There has also been a major push by MSM to act more as a platform for ideologies rather than actual reporting. If you think that isn't true you need to look again. 
Questioning the mainstream media should not be automatically labelled "alt right" I'm a registered Dem and the MSM needs to get its shit together.
