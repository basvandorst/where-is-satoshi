Perhaps one of the reasons this industry is lagging so far behind in innovation is because it is over-regulated?
The idea that the flow of money needs to be closely guarded and politicized.

Regardless of the incentive, this is an interesting technical project and something which the **bitcoin community should absolutely do**!
