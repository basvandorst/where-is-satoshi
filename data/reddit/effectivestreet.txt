My dude, let that anger out all you want, people are opening their minds and abilities. They are not only gaining wealth but also knowledge and understanding of an unchained system. Which in turn helps with so much.
You clearly know it all, but that pent up anger shows you haven't solved it all. Knowledge and actually solving problems are two different things.
I hope you do start reading and join the crypto space, it needs more individuals and I really think you would not only benefit from it, but would also be able to help others. If you ever need help let me know.

If you don't understand the intricacies of governments being involved with drugs or the banking system allowing the laundering of money with impunity. Well then you need to educate yourself.
This ego stroking can go on forever my friend, please I wait for your next snarky comment so I can post another.

 Holy shit dude, you sound like a tool. Even if your intentions were good the way you are replying and backing up your initial thoughts is pathetic. Yet you feel you had moral superiority or weren't "a dumbass" and were thinking more clearly?
you're an SJW, making a big deal out of nothing. let people do what they do, if a company is good, focusing on their product. stupid ass twitter and reddit posts won't matter to them.
Fact is we dodged a bullet with S2X...or were you not here during that time? Fact is many companies that supported S2X, and that still exist, showed they lack morals or technical knowledge or both. Through blatant propaganda, lies, misunderstanding etc. 
But yea keep calling people cultist/extremist.
fuck outta here with your bullshit.

Did you know many of the wealthy families from Massachusetts (we are talking 1800-1900, extremely wealthy to this day) have roots in selling Opium to China? Even though China made it illegal and was going through major issues similar to the Opiod crisis right now in USA?
Did you know these families on purpose didn't give a fuck and even after regulations by USA went into place they still did it?
Did you know these families then kept their fortunes and made even more money and were in the highest social groups of Boston/USA at the time? And their families, are still rich to this day.
Maybe read some fucking books, read history and you won't spout such non-sense.. You sound like a 17 year old who really doesn't know shit about this country which is built on drugs.

Oh you're british or from the UK area. No wonder you think you are pathetic and that governments control you. Ya'll still are owned by an old ass lady. Remember Britain is run by child rapist and ya'll did nothing. So the entire society of Britain showed you're a bunch of pathetic cowards. That does not mean the rest of the world is.
Also, read a fucking book on the internet, future shock, sovereignty, austrian economics and fucking bitcoin. Maybe you won't sound like a CHAV.
