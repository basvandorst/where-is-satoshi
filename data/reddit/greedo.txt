After the AMEX tx clears, the funds need to settle with the processor. That normally takes a couple of business days with a domestic processor, several days with an offshore processor.

Emails went out to people that signed the splash page to be notified of the soft launch. A few dozen bought so far. Hopefully someone can chime in. :)

You'll have to buy a AMEX gift card, but can buy as little as $5 in btc.

Looks really nice. I think I am switching from btcReport.
It would be great if the calculator could save values. It's nice to reference the fiat equivalent of your own holdings.
Oh, and I need a MSB/bitcoin friendly bank.

Bitcoin has the most adoption, but it is not the most flexible.
As an example, Ethereum boasts a turing complete virtual machine that can enable creation of blockchain secured contracts, something that bitcoin cannot do. Ethereum can also handle a higher transaction rate than bitcoin currently can.
Given the state of global bitcoin adoption, its supremacy over other crytpotokens is not a given.
Altcoins are healthy for bitcoin, they demand improvement through competition.
