In 2015, Goldman forecasted Oil to end the year at $200. It landed at $30

Try Coinburp. Free and instant deposits direct from a UK bank account, i think they just charge 1% spread. £5 GBP withdrawal fee though

Yeah, no plan to sell for at least a few years and it's money I don't mind losing but I need to get used to these swings. I don't see this in any other investment. Need to remind myself to DCA and forget about it

Anything wrong with that?

Why can't you do both? I believe in shares and hold them for the long term but one day I'll cash out. Same with Bitcoin. Whether I do that by converting to fiat or simply spending the Bitcoin, I'm still going to use it one day.

I use Coinburp. Instant and free deposit from a UK bank account and fees are fair. Haven't had any problems with them

If you're self employed, you'd start one yourself and would get tax benefits for doing so. Government employees get exactly the same provision - one from the State and one private with a bank.
It's now mandatory for all companies, not just private, over 20 employees to pay a contributory pension. The employee has to put a minimum of 4% of salary in and the company has to match a minimum of 4%

Was not a good day to have my first venture into Bitcoin.....

Same here. Money I don't mind losing but fuck, it's still a lot of money

As someone who bought for the first time earlier in the year, a near the last peak, I needed to see this.

I don't know if that's correct. I can choose the allocation/funds of my company pension. It's managed by a bank, not the State. When you retire, you get 2 pensions - one from the State, which is minimal, and one which you accumulate through employers and sits in banks
