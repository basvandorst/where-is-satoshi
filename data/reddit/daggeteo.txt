Let's say I have 3 different addresses where smaller amounts (nickles) have been delivered. 
If I were to send all BTC in my wallet this to a forth address would it then eventuelly be turned in to a "dollar bill"? 
I understand that it would take some time but time wouldn't be critical if we are talking about days.

Hehe, lesson learned! While on the subject of dust, would 0.001 BTC be considered dust?

Good answer! It seems I won't be able to cheap out of this one :)

Thanks for the detailed answer. My comprehension of how works seems to be confirmed. 
The transaction fees are a concern. You say that I'll have to pay a fee to get those transactions processed. I thought it only was if I want it get higher priority, ie. no fees means I'll have to wait longer for transaction to be processed. But if I'm interpreting you correct you're saying the transaction won't get processed at all?!
The last paragraph is the exact reason why I'm looking to "merge" the bitcoins I have.
Again, thanks for detailed answer!
Edit: If you have three faucets with nickels and dimes, would YOU send them to a forth address without any fee, in an attempt to merge them? :)
