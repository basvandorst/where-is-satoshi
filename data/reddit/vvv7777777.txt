Use a Ledger / Trezor. Definitely worth getting a hardware wallet if you're going to be holding a lot of coins.

~$700 very soon after news is widespread. I think so because:
- Price is being pumped very hard right now in anticipation. If people are wrong, a lot of traders are going to dump, causing a big amount of weak hands to follow.
- ETF is covering a lot of underlying problems in the community that people might pay more attention to post ETF-hype. (Slow transactions, deadlock).
- By the time ETF decision is approved, more China news might be in the spotlight and things are not looking good over there.

I use Transferwise to transfer money from USD to CAD and it takes almost a week. So I'm not worried...yet.

Wouldn't be surprised if they do some hackery to bypass the high fee and clogged blockchain.

Why hasn't he or BTCC tweeted about bad news recently (to inform people)?
For example, no tweet about further extension on BTC/LTC withdrawals on Feb 15 and nothing about PBoC by 
Edit: Any plans to add Qtum?

Kraken has 5x leverage with BTC/EUR vs 3x with BTC/USD. In case anything happens.

Two guys (known as Winklevoss Twins) filed for a bitcoin ETF years ago. There's lots of hype around this because it will allow "regular" investors to invest in the market -- which will cause the price to skyrocket.
The final deadline for the SEC to make a decision is March 11 and people are speculating leading up to that date whether or not it will get approved.
