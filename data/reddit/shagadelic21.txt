I think there is a high probability that btc might get banned everywhere. What will happen to the price then?

What if you lose? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:17:31
OP waiting for a dip... it's not coming.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:16:33
well, if there is 7 billion ppl in the world and only 21 million bitcoins.. which are proving to be the currency of the future.. then everyone wants one and its becoming more and more scarce driving the price up. The technology adds a n "honesty" aspect to the internet by having all transactions revealed across the network. 
I think.. haha

Sounds like someone with a short position. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:58:58
IMO I think the shorts will cause a mild dip if any. Price might blow up even at a faster rate with so many more player joining the party. A lot of people will jump on with any signs of a dip.

This is a virus that keeps on growing.

Hoping they'll get on board soon.

Hmm.. i doubt this would work on any individual trader but might be done to trigger algorithms at play.

Yea but I’ve talked with him for a while and he always wanted some except he never got around to getting his own.. so thought it’d be ok in this case. I wouldn’t consider gifting bitcoin to someone that had no exposure to it.
@_date: 2018-06-16 10:00:22
Ok yea I thought that too. But how would I go about organizing a wallet for someone other than myself.. I’d still have access to the wallet, and I do need to put my email down no? 
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:09:42
I haven’t seen this before. Obviously running an algorithm, but why make so many minimal transactions? And it looks like they’re losing here.

Ouch.. wedding is tomorrow 
@_date: 2018-06-16 09:58:36
I still need to create a wallet and use an email address.. right? And then I put the info down on the card..
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:08:25
Care to fill us in?
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:11:01
Thank you! 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:43:22
Yes! I just set it up... buuut will probably wait for the next correction... kicking myself 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:36:21
I could have gotten in at $500 but could not figure out how to get my hands on some... still not sure how to.. SOS PLEASE HELP ME!! 
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:58:49
This drop cleaned up all my market orders. Lowest one was at $5950. Did not expect such a drop.. WOW

I too am creating a site/platform and was thinking of doing the same.
