This has the two coins against each other. Add the two numbers together, and you're there :-)
(no chart though)

You write that the probability of a software bug decreases for each day. This seems correct intuitively. But what about the magnitude of the impact of such a bug? Does it increase at a slower rate than the bug probability decreases, ie. is the probability weighted consequence going up or down?
Would be interesting to get Nassim Taleb’s take on this.

I have the same problem. Am waiting for a response.
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:26:43
Am interested in this too

Sent the first request sometime last week. Sent another one on Friday. Then they sent a mail on Tuesday asking if I still had an issue, and to reply to them, if this was the case. Still haven't heard back after this.

Wouldn't it make it easier to estimate fees if the "Mempool size in MB" chart's Y axis was reverse, so you could see what the fee is at around the 1 MB mark? It *can* be done now, but it's more difficult.

Still more than most most likely have saved on fees. Plus the option of claiming new forks has value (even if you personaly only believe in btc)

Makes sense, and thanks for the links!

This seems like a pretty significant price to pay for lower transaction fees (missing out on the value of forks)? Surprised it isn't talked about more in the context of moving funds to segwit addresses.

Ahh lol, I missed the "not" in b\_lumenkraft's post, but thanks.
But based on [this]( post further up, having the btc on a segwit address isn't unequivocally a superior option as I read it (because of likelihood of not being included in a block).
@_date: 2019-04-04 07:08:45


Does this mean that segwit addresses don't get all forks? It's not that I "like" collecting them, but they clearly have monetary value, so I would hate not picking that up.
Sorry about the amateur hour here :)
@_date: 2019-04-04 06:25:19
Could you elaborate on this?
@_date: 2019-04-04 12:29:02




Do you disagree with this part?
@_date: 2019-04-04 12:31:20
Right now if I send from my ledger, even from a segwit address, I just look up what type of fee is relevant; similar to the picture in the OP. Would you then discount the fee # found there with the "segwit discount" or how would you implement this saving in practice? 
@_date: 2019-04-04 06:23:23


Does this mean that transactions sent to and/or from segwit addresses won't be included in a given block if those miners find it?
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:44:34
What's the effect of this?
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:07:30
Ahh, yes, good point! Thanks for the clarification and confirmation
