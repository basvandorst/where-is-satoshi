When does this thing bust loose? If I recall 11.7k is the big number we need to blast through.

Are we selling today?

What goes up must come down.

@_date: 2019-06-27 00:59:15
I did the same but lost .4
@_date: 2019-06-25 19:12:38
Not to be confused with butt loose.
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:59:16
I agree.
@_date: 2018-03-14 09:39:04
I think the Google ban will destroy the price for a little while.
@_date: 2018-02-22 02:31:56
Any specific tools you use for this?

He is allowing the market to work. Whale pump and dump is how the market works. How do you think it works? You think everyone just buys and waits for ATH?

Cool thanks.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:07:47
You were right.
@_date: 2018-03-03 02:46:06
Nope it's a whale pump.

Did he say dying market or he didn't think it would last forever? At one point he said BTC could be worth Million dollars. He might still feel that way.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:05:44
I agree with you. Good luck.

FYI if you're in USA you have to sign for it. At least I did.

When East Coast wakes up do they buy or sell?
