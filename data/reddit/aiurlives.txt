How so?  So the government can't just take your money from your bank account, but bitcoin isn't some magic pill for being able to avoid taxes.  If you want to own property, that can still be taxed.  If you want to buy goods, the merchants can still be required to collect and pay sales taxes.  If you have a job, your employer can still be required to withhold and pay income tax on your behalf.  Yes there are some scenarios where taxation becomes more difficult and, yes, tax evasion becomes easier, but no, bitcoin does not make taxation impossible.


How far would the original bitcoin have gotten without the internet?   How much value would your bitcoins have tomorrow if the internet ceased to exist today?  You see, your worldview takes social institutions like the internet for granted.  But it only exists because of standards and regulations that were partly developed by government and partly developed by private industry.

Perhaps in a textbook fantasy, but not in reality.  In reality, monopolists have many tools beyond attempting to use government to enforce their monopoly.  Economies of scale, High capital requirements (barriers to entry, i.e. the cable industry monopoly), technological superiority, controlled access to resources, and network externalities. 


Standard Oil, which would still be a monopoly today had the government not broken them up.  AT&amp;T comes to mind, as well as Comcast.  There's only 1 Satellite radio provider when there used to be 2. 
Monopolists often use government power to help enforce their monopoly, but its not required.  In fact, government authority is really the only thing that can break up a well established monopoly.

Barriers to entry, consumer sentiment, technological superiority, controlled access to resources.  You know, all the market forces beyond "gubmint" that dictate how markets work.
Let's take an example you might be more familar with; bitcoin mining.  Notice how the market has favored consolidation towards fewer mining pools.  In fact, the market really favors one big mining pool as that would provide the greatest economy of scale.  The only reason this hasn't happened is that the community understands the 51% rule and has sough to regulate itself against allowing a single pool to control the market.
Capital Markets favor the greatest efficiency, not the greatest diversity or the greatest equality.

@_date: 2014-08-26 14:55:01


That's not correct.


The DeBeers monopoly on the world diamond supply contradicts what you "think".


In a vertically integrated market, the owners of the resources are the same people who own the distribution and delivery systems.  They maximize their profits by controlling the whole supply chain and have no interest in selling the resources to a buyer who is going to compete with them.


People switching mining pools to protect the asset is evidence of community cooperation.  Its a form of self-governance.


I think you should spend some time studying markets and monopolies.  Monopolies always end up increasing the prices that consumers pay for goods or services.  In a true monopoly situation, the "market" is powerless to correct the behavior because there are no actors who can disrupt the monopoly. 


Indeed, is that what has happened in the Cable or wireless markets in the United States?  The profits are enormous, yet the number of actors keeps decreasing.  I'm afraid reality just doesn't work the way you want it to.

Neither one is inherently more secure than the other.  The security of your bitcoins depends a lot more on the physical security of your device than it does on the software which generated the private keys.


Maybe yes, maybe no.  Using an open source wallet helps to ensure that there are no secret backdoors built into the software for use by the developers.  In an open source project, anyone who knows how to read the source code would be able to discover the backdoor exploit and expose it.
But again, your wallet security depends more on the device which is running the wallet than the wallet software itself.  If your wallet is stored on an Android phone running an 8 month old beta version of Cyanogen, it probably isn't very secure.

The mining difficulty doesn't determine the price of bitcoin.  The market of buyers and sellers determine the price.  Miners must adjust to the price, not vice versa.  As prices rise, more people will want to mine because more people will be able to mine at a profitable rate. As the price falls, miners will fall off the network leaving the coins to be mined by those with a lower marginal cost.  If enough miners fall off the network, the difficulty will go down, which changes the profitability calculation for all miners.  The total hashing power of the network depends on the price of bitcoin.  The price however, is not strongly affected by the total hashing power.  


Not really.  Mining provides security to the network, but the "value" of bitcoins is intrinsic to the coins themselves.  The coins are valuable because people believe they have value.

Dealing in Bitcoin does not lower your banking and finance costs to zero. You have to pay developers to build Bitcoin integration into your system and then keep up with it as the Bitcoin code evolves. You have additional costs realized when the trading price of Bitcoin fluctuates; you cannot pay all of your suppliers or employees in Bitcoin.  You must pay fees on your transactions if you expect miners to pick them up in this century. You have support costs as you spend time assisting customers with navigating the difficulty of obtaining bitcoins and transferring them to you.

I think that is, perhaps, carrying the technology a bit too far.  I don't see how the technology allows you to "enforce" a contract, nor how it would eliminate the need for lawyers to write and interpret said contracts.

Please provide some reasoning for this statement? Can you not thing of a single reason litecoin would be useful? Perhaps your imagination needs some work.

Incorrect. Miners provide security to transactions. Without miners cryptocurrencies could not exist.  Miners have many currencies to choose from and their support helps to create and maintain the value of that currency.

True.  But I would argue that LTC is not a direct clone of BTC.  By adopting the scrypt algorithm, Litecoin takes advantage of a glut of GPU miners on the market that can no longer effectively participate in mining BTC.  It also has a smaller blockchain and faster confirms.  Those are "innovations" that provide value to the market in the long term and, IMO, don't detract from the value of bitcoins in any way.

It also means diversifying your assets within a category.  Assume an investment portfolio that includes 5% "bonds."  Investing that entire 5% in bonds from a single issuer would be less diversified than investing that same money into bonds from 20 different issuers.  Inside that category, an investor might put 80% into AAA related bonds, 10% into AA, etc. 
Cryptocurrency is no different.  Among the portion of your portfolio invested in crypto, breaking those investments into multiple currencies would represent "diversification."  We can argue about the specific values of each currency and what proportion of your portfolio should be in each, but to say that investing in multiple cryptocurrencies is not diversification is not factually correct.


How about we stick to factual arguments and not make this personal?

You can walk into a public library and use a computer to set up a free wallet on blockchain.info.  Dividing bitcoins isn't "free" as you say, but its so cheap that the service is offered for free.

Those people should keep holding.  The value will recover and they will make money in the long run.  Anyone who bought thinking they could get rich in 4 weeks was seriously deluding themselves.

If you haven't conducted a survey, you don't "know" anything.  You're making assumptions based on limited information.  That's not science, that's religion.

Typing in all caps is rude and doesn't help make your point.  Have a downvote.

Why would they need to? Only traders with membership to the I stock exchange will be allowed to trade. The government can just order these brokers to hand over the bitcoin private keys if they decide to seize whatever assets are in the country at any given time.

What does that prove? That coin is dead and litecoins are still around and being supported by a considerable number of miners.  It may never match btc in terms of value but that doesn't mean there is no place for it in the market.

What do you mean "soon"? For well over a decade my bank has charged me for keeping deposits there. They've cloaked these charged by calling them overdraft fees, or charging me for making too many electronic transactions in a month, or some other bullshit.  Saying  that they will start to charge you for storing your money just means they've decided to be honest for a change.
