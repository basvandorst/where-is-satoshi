"Hope" is a word we can associate with fear, uncertainty and doubt.


You mean a centralized coin? Cool.

As soon as you can **prove** that everything is securely client-side encrypted before being saved in our servers, and that we exclusively deal with unreadable data, I think an app like Tapeke is a good start to get the average joe from full data-suckers apps to cryptographically secure and decentralized apps. It's one of the steps.


It's fine if you think so. We are just creating something we think it's needed right now. Feel free not to use the app if you don't feel comfortable.
As you may know there's a number of ways of monetizing an app without necessarily have closed source software. The Bitcoin world is growing exponentially, so it's hard to make long term plans. We just release the app for free and then see what users need and what we can deliver depending on our resources.


Again, it's fine if you think that there's *only one true way* of doing business. We are just trying to do our part.
You've just earned a Private Beta invite! Seriously, you seem a really respectful guy, so we'd like to have you on board. Your tips on our app may be precious.

You are blaming Bitcoin for what it is now. Why don't you take some time to read all the available possibilities? (and most of all are in development right now).
This reminds me of "internet is a fad, you can only send emails, and nobody has an email address!".


As soon as I'm the only one holding the private keys, I'm the only **owner** of my bitcoins. 


You fail to realize that Bitcoin is not an american phenomenon. It's international. Good luck at closing all major international exchanges at once.
Also, as soon as we have more decentralized companies and projects, every government will become less and less strong.

We implemented our own protocol using a combination of AES encryption, window.crypto property and RSA keys. You can choose between three different levels of encryption for your account: with Medium and Advanced encryption we are not able to see your addresses / balances / transactions / statistics.
We would just process your data without knowing what it is, hence the zero-knowledge definition of the app.
We are opening for private beta soon and also sourcing respected bitcoin security professionals and zero-knowledge privacy advocates to audit our process to confirm it is truly zero-knowledge.
@_date: 2014-12-05 22:43:11
You are absolutely right. If BIP70 was implemented by most merchants and / or third party services, we would be very very happy to automatically show you *business_name* and *spending_category*  (and any other useful data) for your transactions.
Actually Tapeke lets you **manually** set categories for your public addresses, both for incoming and outgoing transactions. ...but this could change.

@_date: 2014-12-05 21:26:45
Thank you for your question.
I believe Tapeke is really the *first* personal finance application for Bitcoin.
There are some accounting / "watch-only" services out there, but certainly nothing with a complete set of accounting features.
The "zero-knowledge" part is an addition, just something we really care about.
Being first of the market offers some benefits, but lots of responsibilities too.
@_date: 2014-05-08 20:09:31


The intrinsic value of Bitcoin comes from its features, features that you cannot find anywhere before Bitcoin was born.


Did I say this?




As you know, that's not possible because of the volatility. We are in the early years of this technology, and there is low liquidity.
Again, you cannot blame Bitcoin for what it is now.
@_date: 2014-11-26 18:03:07
Can't resist, sorry:
"The jury (literally) is still out on Bitcoin. If I were a betting man, I’d say that the Federal Government or InterPol will shut down all Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency transactions in the near future. And if you think that Silk Road and Mt Gox left people feeling the pain, just wait until Uncle Sam decides that Bitcoin is not only shady but illegal."

Tapeke.com does what you said. It allows you to organize your public addresses into wallets / groups and get the total balance.
It's also client-side encrypted so you don't have to share your wealth with the world.
Public beta launches on January 1st.

Actually you can only use standard and multisignature bitcoin wallets. We plan to integrate more solutions as we go ahead with the sprints.

Show me that I did something against the law, and I'll pay.
This is how justice should work, instead of "I take your money. Show me that you are not wrong."
The italian government consists of two things: mafia and bureaucracy.
Eternal bureaucracy means that you'll lose your money.
I'm not against taxes, I'm against ridiculous and excessive taxes, made by thieves.
PS.: corruption actually is about 4% of the italian GDP.

As of now, and throughout all the Private / Public Beta phase, it will be a regular website.
We want to test our security protocol and see if something needs to be changed / improved before launching version 1.0, then we'll release a browser extension and we'll also open source the zero-knowledge protocol of the app.
Never thought about Node-Webkit, thanks for that!
@_date: 2014-12-05 17:16:20
That's a great question!
That (indeed, awesome) feature would definitely require some degree of encrypted integration / communication of content between Tapeke and BitPay/Coinbase/Coinkite/etc or the merchant. I think it's feasible, but very tricky for now. 
In a zero-knowledge environment it's very hard to implement all the desirable features you may think of, but I'll talk to the dev team!

That's the kind of feedbacks / ideas we really need to get from the community. I agree with all what you've said. I'll look into this and we'll come up with a plan for the final release.
We are a young startup, so we are not afraid of changing our infrastructure if it's worth the efforts.
If it's for the better, we are in.


I'll make sure that we add those warning.


Thank you, your message is appreciated :-)
@_date: 2014-12-05 18:04:36
Technically it's feasible in a number of ways, we can also create a "Tapeke Directory" in which all interested merchants input their business name and spending category, and all those details would be automatically shared with all Tapeke accounts. 
Anyways, currently all limits depend on the zero-knowledge system that's currently implemented in Tapeke.
We'll see what we can do in future releases :-)

Tapeke will be a web app in both Private and Public Beta. Then we'll start working on the version 1.0 and we'll try to deliver a product that's as much secure as possible.
It could be a chrome extension, or a standalone app as suggested by [this comment](

Well, I think we have the same dream!
It would be great to offer HD wallets and multisign addresses together with the current functionalities. The issue here is that providing such features requires an additional degree of security practices, and because of our limited resources (we are a bootstrapped startup) we have to focus on specific things.
Our goal now is to offer a feature-rich and secure accounting app. Then we'll see what happens. I can't tell now! Literally.

Yes, client-side-encrypted is the most correct description, although when it comes to "zero-knowledge privacy", what matters is that the service provider (aka Tapeke) doesn't have access to plaintext data (nor anyone else).
@_date: 2015-03-11 17:55:02
Nicolò from Tapeke here. Before we roll out the first integrations with HD wallets and exchanges, we plan to turn the web app into a standalone cross-platform desktop application, where your private data is encrypted and saved locally.
Privacy and security are the most important things, before anything else, even if we don't get traction as a startup.
