I googled that Roubini a little already. He surely is very close to the old boys clubs in almost every way. And since he shills fintech extremely heavily and bashes blockchain way beyond what a normal critical person would i suspect there is alot more to be found in that area. I’d bet money he is making ALOT of money in industries or companies that crypto threatens!!
Found just one hint on that already: He’s a senior consultant at  -A specialized investment banking boutique, focused on emerging markets, financial institutions and restructuring &amp; special situations.
COME ON PEOPLE WE NEED TO DIG UP EVERYTHING WE CAN ON GUYS LIKE THIS AND SHOW THE OLD WORLD LOBBYISTS WE WILL EXPOSE THEM AND THEIR SHADY MOTIVATIONS!
I’m not a very good detective.. but found some more crazy stuff about him. He seems to think of himself like a hotshot, living an extravagant lifestyle and his dream is to become the best fuck in town.. 
He seems to be a genuine asshole.. 
And i especially hate it how he insults all of us every chance he gets..
And for an economist he sure likes to spend:

Good find!
He’s just a wrinkly dirty old man looking for more money so he can find more golddiggers to get his kicks. There is an article about him that he likes to hang with grad students. It’s bordering on pedophilia for a 60 year old fucker to want to hang with 22 year old students..
Without money he wouldn’t have a shot... at all...
Perhaps we should do some  research on this perv... and offer BTC to help potential victims seek justice if they have proof. that would be a double whammy!

Are you?
In general, as interest rates are reduced, more people are able to borrow more money. The result is that consumers have more money to spend, causing the economy to grow and inflation to increase. The opposite holds true for rising interest rates. As interest rates are increased, consumers tend to save as returns from savings are higher. With less disposable income being spent as a result of the increase in the interest rate, the economy slows and inflation decreases.
Under a system of fractional-reserve banking, interest rates and inflation tend to be inversely correlated. This relationship forms one of the central tenets of contemporary monetary policy: central banks manipulate short-term interest rates to affect the rate of inflation in the economy.
To understand how this relationship works, it's important to understand the banking system, the quantity theory of money and the role interest rates play.

That this plan is even worse than what has already been happening since the federal reserve(which isn’t federal and has no reserves��)  was created.
“Because with their minus 6% interest rate proposal cash becomes a threat to their hyperinflation plan because they have no way to devalue the cash you already carry with you by 6% at the same time. Which is “a problem”.. LOL
This plan is just complete crazyness trying to keep affloat a system that was mathematically impossible to work FAIRLY long term anyway.
The earth it’s resources are finite... let’s value all those resources with something that’s infinite! (Like paper+ink an old boys network creates out or thin air)

I agree with you. People are so traumatized by the bearmarket they are almost fighting to be the first to shitcomment on good news being posted.

Deflation should be a good thing. It would encourage people to buy things they really desire or really need. And would create an economy based on things people deem important enough to potentially lose some networth on. Deflationary currency was the basis for the biggest economic growth the US has ever seen. (1900’s)
Stimulating inflation by making your hard earned money lose value at an increasing rate is just immoral basically. And if that is what this system has grown to rely on, then we need a new system.
*Quick, go buy some stuff because your money is becoming worthless anyway!!* (And there’s and entire generation of indoctrinated “economists” who think that sounds logical)
How did that saying go... “economists are like dating experts without a girlfriend..”

I’m convinced Hal Finney was involved also. (Juicy detail: within 15min of Finney’s house lives a guy called “Satoshi Nakamoto” who got his house foreclosed by banks... what are the odds on that one...)
Also died(R.I.P.) before Craig started making his psychopath, ridiculous claims..
