This happened to me a couple of months ago, eBay buyer waited 50 days to do a charge back on an item (a printer ink cartridge that they had no need for because their printer broke). I provided PayPal with emails of our conversations where the buyer basically admitted they messed up and didn't need the item anymore. PayPal sided with the buyer despite all the evidence i provided, it took a few more phone calls and me threatening to cancel my PayPal account but i got them to refund my money to me as well as the charge back fee. Meanwhile the buyer got his money back and got to keep my item...
