The People's Bank of China Shanghai headquarter and the Shanghai Municipal Finance Office and other units formed a joint inspection team and carried out on-site inspection on BTCChina. The operation is focused on checking whether the company is operating beyond its scope, whether it is conducting the business of credit(loans), payment, remittance and/or other related business without necessary license or authorization, whether there is market manipulation, the implementation of anti money laundering system, financial security risk and so on.

It may be one of the good options ;)
@_date: 2017-04-07 18:49:27
Yep, the situation is the same in China. Alipay and WeChat pay is super popular, even could use them to rent the shared-mobai bike. They are like born for internet. If bitcoin could be used to rent bike, buy breakfast on the street, then it'll have chances.
@_date: 2017-04-07 18:51:52
Scan the QR code, they have their own calculate rate into JPY, you send bitcoin to coincheck, just like bitpay 
@_date: 2017-04-07 17:01:52
When I travelled in Japan, it seems coincheck paid advance for users, it'll take around 3mins to finish the payment 
@_date: 2017-04-07 18:28:45
I think 
@_date: 2017-04-07 18:28:23
I had a short interview with the manager of Hackers bar, from what he said, Japanese people still afraid of hacker and doubt about Bitcoin's security, MT.Gox left them really bad impression.

Indeed, Since Alipay and wechat is super convenient in China, i don't think general people now will accept Bitcoin for just a ice cream.
For large amounts trading maybe they prefer bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-09-18 07:31:57
Don't worry. BITKAN can handle big orders. They have many sources with bitcoin traders. Also, you can get 1to1 service due to this huge amount of need. sandy will help.
@_date: 2016-09-18 04:30:11
I think BITKAN can be a good choice. It's an app, based in China, provide p2p bitcoin trading platform, escrow and wallet service.My friend have brought bitcoins on it before, very safe and convenient.
