I like the way coinbase ACH from my checking account for Bitcoin purchases.  I dont like how they timed their release and adding bcash yesterday along with Roger FUD, so I need to take my business elsewhere.  What other exchange does take FIAT $ direct from my checking account for small purchases, perhaps recurring.  I dont want to wire ahead, and wait forever for it to clear.   Can I get a suggestion for one?  I want to tell the noobs a new place also, I have been sending them to Coinbase, but I cant anymore. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:15:29
Im happy to see Roger get out of BTC.  For 2 main reasons.
1: he uses his BTC to attack the Bitcoin network, while he pushes bcash.  The less BTC he has, the less potent his future attacks will be.
2: There is alot of concentrated wealth in the super early adopters, and for the good of Bitcoin, we need this spread out, so sell away Roger, I know I will take some from you with a smile.

I think most here are anti ETF because having so much bitcoin in custodial control of the management of the ETF puts that organization in disproportional control over the future development of the protocol in the same way the large mining pools voted on behalf of the actual miners in the segwit activation in 2017.  Its just a matter of resisting centralization.

As bitcoin mining rewards go down, the value of the transactions fees will rise (Market based).  At some point the transactions fees will be more than the mining reward as transactions fees begin to fuel the security of the bitcoin network.  You may think that the fees would not be enough to cover the electricity costs of mining + profit, but those tx fees in terms of fiat (Or cost or energy) will be worth alot more than today easily making up for the  diminishing reward.    After 2140, the miners will only get tx fees when they solve blocks, but long before that they would be almost only relying on the tx fees.

When we first started to design this service, we thought of exactly that issue.  We wanted to design it so that we can monitor it, but dont know our members public address, so we designed it to encrypt the addresses with each members unique key which is stored in the users phone.   I could go further into how we do this, but in a nutshell, we do not have access to our members addresses by design.  We dont want to have addresses leaked, or hacked, and we dont want to be in a position where we are forced to hand them over to anyone.  We take the privacy of our members very seriously.

This happened to me when I had my node on a raspi. 
I reinstalled on another machine (actually a fresh VM) and moved bitcoin blockchain from another of my nodes there,
installed lnd, move lightning database (chainstate) to new system. Unlock wallet. I was able to close my channels and remove the funds.

I have to say that Paper/Cloth Cash Money would have intrinsic value while in the furnace turning into heat for your home. 
Being able to spend it in an emergency is not intrinsic. You can burn it, use it as padding for a jacket to keep you warm. Im sure some can think of other uses. Ask the Venezuelans who seem to be using it to clean the streets.
@_date: 2019-03-07 14:29:15
This is a great project. 
You can run a node on gear that is much more redundant and has better fault tolerance than a rasperry. And have a place to store your pics and files and keep control (The Cloud is giving control away of your stuff) 
I had my drive fail on my Rasperry, and quickly realized how important it is to be reduce single point of failures. 
If the Lightning network is going to be reliable, the nodes need to be. 
I posted about this, and was hoping someone would do the work.  I will probably play with this over the next week, I have a Synology looking for a purpose. 
Thank You

Mining will not end in 2140. Mining rewards end in 2140.
Mining will still go on, being compensated with tx fees, instead of fresh/new bitcoin.

I dont know if this will work with just any IP applications. Its main use case (as I understand it) is to give people and commercial users a way to communicate to each other in case of internet outage like 9/11 or major weather event.  They have a texting / messenger app that will work over the mesh network.  
I dont know if we can route just any packets over that network.  I may be wroing, does anyone know?

"You can take your country out of bitcoin, but you can never take bitcoin out of your country".
Loosely quoted from Andreas Antonopoulos
@_date: 2019-08-11 13:19:40
That means you need to get verified to be able to withdraw bitcoin. Once verified you will be able to send your bitcoin (There are daily limits) to any bitcoin address (Including new bech32 bc1 addresses)
I remember it being a bit clumsy getting verified. It prompts in app to take photo of id, then yourself. etc.
I forget what triggers the prompt.
I remember it took me over a day or 2 to get verified to withdraw, but once verified you can withdraw whenever you want. I think up to 30 times per month, but you shouldn't do it that often (Good UTXO management)

If its available in your country, cashapp is an excellent solution for purchasing bitcoin or stacking sats. I started using it recently, and this is my opinion.
When you purchase bitcoin you purchase it slightly over market price you see on the other exchanges, but there is no other fee, so this is where you pay the fee.(I haven't calculated the markup yet)
There is also no fee to withdraw to a wallet where you control your own keys. Keep in mind that you need to ask for permission to withdraw, but it went smooth for me. I suggest you start with a small purchase then ask for withdraw permission, once approved go for bigger purchases. They ask why you are withdrawing, with multiple choice including options like Investment, Trading, Making a Purchase, etc.
Another great thing is that you have access to the bitcoin you purchase immediately. There is no waiting days or a week like many of the others.
You can even send bitcoin to the app, but the address you send to is a legacy bitcoin address. Im sure this will change to segwit addresses soon. (At least thats what I hear).
Keep in mind that any bitcoin you leave in your cashapp balance is not fully under your control. As we say, "Not your keys, not your bitcoin."
There is a weekly purchase limit of 10K USD, various other limits too. Full KYC/AML regulated exchange.
All in all I like it, a great way to stack sats.

Its worth noting that the amount of satoshis in a single bitcoin could more easily be increased if that need ever arise. 
Say 100,000,000,000 or more.
Its also worth noting that the lightning network already routes sub-satoshis. 
There is zero need to increase or decrease the current supply schedule. 
Anyone who advocates for it has ulterior motives.

He is not talking about crypto, he is talking about Bitcoin.
He is saying that Bitcoin is a platform for decentralized trust. With that trust, currency is an obvious application but with such a trust platform there are other applications that are coming that we didnt think of yet, or dont need yet.  Its coming and coming to Bitcoin.

As a bonus, it will double as a space heater.
-- I do have to agree with the others who say run a node.  Not just any node, a core node (bitcoin.org) at the latest version available.  Make it a fully validating node with port 8333 open

Its probably more accurate to say Bitcoin resisted a well coordinated attack that would have killed any other chain.
It was more than just Roger doing this. Remember all the empty blocks bitmain mined? 
The network is here for us all, if any of us wants to burn through your satoshis on a scheme like that, you will find that the network will soak it up, and still be standing after your pockets are empty. Teachable moments happen like this.
Anti-fragility in action.

@_date: 2019-02-14 11:04:47
This wont happen. There wont be a fixed block reward in bitcoin. If you see that, its not bitcoin. 
Expect the revenue from fees to be more than the cost of running the miners. Fees are market driven and we all need to understand that in the far future the price should be much higher than it is today (In terms of using it to purchase power, even after converting to fiat). 
Plus, if there are too many miners and its not profitable anymore, miners will shut down to the point where it becomes profitable to the others who didnt shutdown, and are more efficient.  
Again, if you see the miners reward change, it is no longer Bitcoin. (I mean you will see that in a forked coin, but not in Bitcoin)

I dont get why people would risk that much bitcoin just to get a tiny slither if profit on an arbitrage trade.  Even people who put BIG bitcoin up on exchanges to margin loan is crazy. There is risk in this, when leaving any big (or any amount) on exchanges, as you have learned.  trying to turn that 1200 BTC into 1201, turned it into 0 instead.  
stop being stupid with your BTC.

Even though lightning network is another network, its bitcoin that flies around in it. (Others too).  If you can get the massive security of bitcoin, why would anyone trust their wealth to a centralized startup/project. Before you say this or that is "Not Centralized", understand that every other blockchain (Yes you too Eth) is by far more centralized than bitcoin.  
And to answer your question, with L2 networks (Like lightning), we are getting a network of networks.

I dont suggest day trading.  its almost always better to HODL and accumulate.

If we can do this with the so-called US Dollar Stable Coins, then this could work for people who want to buy in with Fiat into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:28:23
Today its obvious just to get any crypto that your exchange offers, but there are use cases for a future where all currencies (even fiat) are in crypto form.  Having the stable coins connected to lightning network is a big step in that direction.
