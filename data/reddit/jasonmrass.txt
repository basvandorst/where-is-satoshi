Yes they do. They expect that of anyone who makes a sale or exchange of a capital asset at any time in the tax year. People who trade other financial instruments generally have no problem doing this. I would never advise you or anyone on this sub to hide any sort of income, ordinary or capital gains, from the IRS.

It’s actually common in bubbles to have the price rise after a big fall in price because of people looking to buy the asset at a bargain.

He’s where he belongs. He ordered a hit on six men and allowed guns to be sold illegally on his site. People like Ross Ulbricht only make bitcoin look worse than it really is, considering it was used for every illegal transaction on the Silk Road. Politics aside, he’s a bad guy.

OP literally suggested selling “at a discount without tanking the price”, presumably to protect his own investment. Did you not read that part?

If you don’t understand why an investor would sell his asset for the highest price he can sell it for then you probably shouldn’t even be investing. It’s literally called an exchange and this is how investing works. Part of the reason people see bitcoin and crypto in general as a scam is because of the attitude of some investors that selling is bad.

Didn’t this end up being a scam?

Oh I’m sorry is the smart rational investor hurting your useless shitcoin investment? People can sell if they want to sell.

Smart people invest in an asset to make money. If you think the entire world’s interconnected banking system is going to get taken over by a fucking meme coin then you need to grow up. It’s also really shitty to bully people into “hodling” just for the sake of your own investment.

It’s funny that you’re probably hoping people donate in euros just so you can convert into the weaker dollar
