I think it's bad advice ATM because of my reading and TA I'm betting it will go to 8.5 or lower in coming weeks.  It's around 10k right now.  I'm cautiously bullish long but very impatient and glad I got out earlier.  If I'm effective at scalping I can have a margin of 30% to 50%. I don't like somebody saying "you should buy" here (main reason).  For over 1 person who reads and writes here there's going to be 100's or 1000's reading this to see if they should buy or sell now. People who can't afford to lose their savings.  They buy now and sell in a few days or weeks and lose 20+%.  There needs to be a clear uptrend first imho.

It's only a theory, and only if quantum computers are ever developed that can break the current scheme.  IF that ever happens, will they go after a dinky donation address or go after the large cold addresses?  It would still take enormous resources and would happen at a very slow pace.  There will be decades of warning that these types of computers are coming and becoming powerful enough to attempt this feat and when it actually happens, or comes close to happening, there will be ample time to switch to something more secure.  My answer would be there's no provable risk.

You would have to figure in all the mind states and thoughts of the 6 billion people who inhabit the Earth, the future inputs and computations of every trading bot, as well as every single quantum state of every particle in the universe in order to predict the future. This computer would also have to exist in this universe so it would also have to observe and predict it's own inner workings, hence the observer paradox. Better to just observe and enjoy because you can't violate the laws of physics and predict the future, including random future motions of particles that would lead a certain lottery ball to get into the exit tube.

I say "So now that Trump doesn’t like Bitcoin. Democrats will like it"  maybe so

It's true that very few understand cryptology or how blocks are formed and accepted.

I think that makes things even more uncertain.  It depends on how this is received and what is said during the press coverage.

This is horrible advice.  No one person here that reads this and uses this as a decision to trade should buy because they think they have an obligation or that their purchase will move the price.  Any player, no matter how large, can choose to sit out and the market will still be a-ok.

More orders overall with fewer customers.

When did you see them?  Where did you see them?  Who showed them to you?  Did you connect it to your own pool to confirm?  Please share the photos you took of the device and the demonstration setup.  
Edit:  Some of this is answered on Twitter.  It was demonstrated at the Slushpool office on on the morning of 11-22.

Overstuffed it with chips, cards?  How exactly?  They state that they won't release any photos of internals, which is really suspicious.

Don't order.  You'll never receive anything. This company popped up 3 days ago with an earth-shattering product that doesn't exist.  "Sales are made on a commercial basis and not aimed at consumer market nor carry the usual consumer protections. All sales final"  You can only pay in bitcoin, a minimum order of 1 BTC.    Shipping is $246.20.  I don't think they can keep faking that they have a product when they don't, but if they still exist when it's time to ship they will claim endless delays while accepting more orders than they could possibly fill.

Ok, say they are in a spot 1 year from now, they haven't delivered anything.  The people behind this are discovered and know they are facing jail time and lawsuits if they don't start offering refunds, but even if they do they are still ripping everyone off.  You pay a ~ 1 BTC for ~$8000 of gear, but per the terms you are refunded on the cash value.  Meanwhile that BTC has doubled or tripled and you only get &lt;.5BTC returned.

I also ordered 30,000 no problem.  With a DHL Shipping cost of $1.39M(!) it comes out $49,238,901 which they will happily accept your bitcoin, NO REFUNDS!  This company popped up 3 days ago, no history, no announcements.  If they weren't accepting payments this would just be a prank.  It may be a blessing that they set a minimum of 5, fewer victims.

The cord goes from the meter, over the edge of the table and the power cord for the miner comes up from below the table and it's filmed to suggest it's the same cord but it's quite possible it's not.

You stealing power?  lol

I found the original, it was a picture of a Tulipmint.

You won't ever get one, so breakeven point is reached only right now when you decide not to buy one.

Nice find. The title itself says the logo is modified.
