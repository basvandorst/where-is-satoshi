The problem is that Maths requier knowedge to be used. Newspaper are using Math in a way everyone can understand what is behind numbers, the problem is that these numbers are used badly.

Lol... And how am I supposed to think for myself if the news making me think about the bitcoin awarness, big projects and stuff like that, are faked ? xD

What do you mean ?

Ahah funny picture indeed.
But here, we're not talking about corporate medias but mostly about crypto-related medias. Do you think we can compare them in term of practices ? 
I would say a huge yes, that's why I wanted to know if I was alone...

Lol of course it's enough, I don't see why people are bitching here... Wtf guys, he only stole some bitcoins not bombed a school !
If you really think someone stealing money without hurting anyone deserve life sentence, then you probably have a problem.
On the other hand, Ulbricht's sentence was way too much. But is it a reason to destroy someone life just because he wanted to win quick money by typing a private key ?
Not for me.

Well I totaly agree with this idea
@_date: 2015-10-23 13:02:29
Yup, I just looked at it... It's the same on bitcointalk, people don't care about news like that, they prefer upvoting gifs or funny images/price discussions.
This sub is for its majority full of morons having no idea how it works in this world

Better spread false news like this to give attention to bitcoin than saying the truth :$
@_date: 2015-10-21 23:04:43
bitcoin just sounds fishy to the public, and makes anyone in official business/banking vomit :/
@_date: 2015-10-22 19:28:20
Considering the shittyness of events used to create insane hype and lead the bitcoin to madness bubbles, I think THIS is one of the most important event that has ever happened to Bitcoin.
