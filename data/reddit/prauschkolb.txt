Sorry if this is a dumb question...but why would they also list coinbase a payment method?

There are checkboxes on the right side of the screen, just turn on the 'ATH (USD)'

Nice I got one of those coins as a gift as well

'cold storage wallet' is just another way of saying 'hardware wallet'. Which is basically a special kind of USB drive, your private keys are stored on that drive which makes them way more secure because they aren't exposed to the internet. Online wallets are just that, online. Which means there is always the risk of them potentially being hacked. If you're investing a fair amount of cash into crypto currencies, taking your security seriously is pretty important. And an extra $80-$100 for a little piece of mind is 100% worth it.

There’s a site called localbitcoins, you can find someone near you who will pay you cash
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:37:22
Wondering why some are so skeptical of this site? It's just reading public address data that could be read elsewhere. Can someone explain the potential dangers?

Um yeah, why didn't you use gdax? You would have had zero fees. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:30:12
Not sure if it's only available to be people in the US, but if you use gdax.com, and use the limit ordering there are no fees. But what you're wanting to spend is getting close to the minimum order as the price continues to rise.

You should keep your bitcoin in a cold storage wallet. Look into Trezor or Ledger Nano

Seems kinda shady that this person is claiming their only means of paying is with PayPal. PayPal links to either a bank account or credit card, either of which can be used to purchase bitcoin on coinbase.com.

So, what cryptos are deemed to be securities? 
@_date: 2018-02-11 00:37:17
Wow that’s awesome 
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:56:25
Yeah that is the official site for BCash, so of course they are mislabeling things. They suck.

I'm not personally a hater of Bcash the currency, I'm a hater of the people promoting it as BitCoin. Creating confusion for new users. Probably should have branded it BitCash but wanted the Bitcoin name recognition to bamboozle people who don't know better.

I don't see that as a flaw, the majority of cryptos will simply not be worth much or anything at all. It seems bitcoin has maintained it's status (and value) not only due to it being the original but also because it is limited to 21mil. coins. Other cryptos seem to not put that kind of cap on the quantities that can or will be produced.
