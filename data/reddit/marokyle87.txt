But Its not a currency though. You hodl idiots are the the only thing keeping it worth anything at all... but you don't spend it on goods or services therefore it isn't worth anything it's just worthless nerd dick measuring and boy are you guys gonna need the microscopes soon...

Can someone explain to me why holding (yes I'm not in your club) onto your bitcoins is remotely beneficial?   
Your hope is someday somehow the market will reset itself and your coins will be worth more again.  Maybe maybe not who knows but  say you saw the market falling the other way and sold at 17k or something.  And you made idk 50k right?   Then you "hodl" onto that actual money until the market either bottoms out completely and you buy exponentially more coins than you first had, or realize the market isn't ever comming back.  Or wait for the market to start surging again and buy below 17k and still profit with the "hodlrs".   I don't get the riding the ride and leaving your investment in limbo

Go walk in to the dealer and buy one WITH BTC. don't you dare exchange it for dollar bills first and tell me it's real money

When y'all were at 19k you were talking SO much gatekeeping shit.  Now back at 3.4k I keep track literally to watch you lose more money
