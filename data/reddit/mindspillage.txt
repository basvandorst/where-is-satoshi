I will note that while many DPL adopters have an anti-patent stance, I wouldn't characterize its effects that way, especially if I don't want to scare off other potential adopters. Someone can adopt DPL if they are not anti-patent but only believe in sharing with others who have made the same promise, similar to the way not all GPL license users are anti-copyright either. 
(The "anyone can use this" pledge, that's anti-patent...)

The most likely legal theories for the enforceability of patent pledges are estoppel and reliance. (The best legal analysis of the situation is probably the work done by Jorge Contreras, especially [this paper on market reliance]( and his more general paper on [patent pledges]( and their types and effects. Recommended reading if you're a patent nerd, but the tl;dr is that they should be enforceable under these theories.) It's true, it's not watertight, and that's part of the reason to supplement with other strategies. But going and commenting in public about how we intend it to be interpreted would be persuasive to a future court as well!
(Also, thanks. There are many interesting ways to give individuals more power over their own lives; I think Wikipedia and free software are two and hope that Bitcoin is another one.)

I appreciate this post, but there is a major point that needs to be clarified that strengthens its point: no one needs to ask permission, whether they use the DPL or not. (In case it's not clear from my post history, I'm one of Blockstream's counsel.)
The terms of our patent pledge apply to everyone--available to anyone, royalty free, for any type of use, now or in the future, on the sole condition that they don't initiate offensive patent litigation against us (or based on usage of our tech).
Our use of the DPL is an additional layer of defensive use promises, with a few extra features, and because it is structured like a license, is more likely to be watertight--though holding us to it in court should be easy in either case. (An additional aspect is that our patent pledge applies only to non-hardware for now--though we have not sought any hardware patents and have no short-term plans to--but the DPL necessarily applies to all patents an entity holds.)
So Rootstock's claimed problem is already solved by our patent pledge--which is written to be binding on any future assignees of Blockstream patents also. They don't need anything else, and neither does any other user.
That said, Rootstock *should* adopt the DPL, which would add further incentive for others to join in. As far as I can tell, nothing in the linked post brought up as an argument against the DPL is a reason not to use it. It makes a fair point that the DPL alone does not solve all problems that exist with the patent system, and I agree with that. It's why we tried to use multiple layers, and are still working with others toward an industry-wide pool. 
But I can't agree with the idea that its not solving every problem makes it not worth using. It's a powerful tool, and more powerful the more users it has.

I was expecting something different from this title--it doesn't look like it has much to do with blockchain tech specifically! 
As a generic article on software licensing I'd have a few nitpicks which I'm not sure are particularly useful in r/bitcoin, but among them: the Apache license are not copyleft, there is still value in registering the copyright to a permissive license such as MIT if you intend to enforce or want to be able to prove independent authorship, there has been US litigation involving FOSS software licenses and some aspects of the GPL though more specific litigation has happened outside the US, it's "GPLv3" rather than "GNU 3.0", etc. Generally decent, but it's important to get the details right!
My less nitpicky comment is that litigation is difficult and expensive and it's pretty much never the first step--but getting the details right ahead of time means that when you send your polite but firm letter to an infringer, it's more likely to be listened to because you would actually have a case.
That said, the tl;dr to this--"register your copyrights"--is reasonable advice. (Also, that is it extremely advisable to decide what you want to happen and choose a license for your work before you release it publicly, and it will save you pain and annoyance later.)

GPL and Apache 2.0 could both be considered almost two licenses in one--the copyright license and a patent grant. The DPL is *just* the patent part, no copyright license, and its effect is trying to create a similar effect for patent that the GPL does for copyright (though not entirely the same, because the mechanisms of copyright and patent are different).
Which is to say--you're not wrong but there are details that make it different!
@_date: 2016-10-14 17:38:59
Its features are similar to other licenses that are generally accepted; though DPL itself hasn't been widely adopted yet there's no particular reason to think it wouldn't be. It creates something that works similarly to a patent pool (a structure used internationally) through patent licensing (and various forms of public patent grants are also used internationally).
@_date: 2016-10-14 17:42:59
Thanks; glad to see you adopting this. 
@_date: 2016-07-19 18:06:47
The pledge is written to be as legally binding as possible. The DPL is binding, the MIPA is binding. The FAQ is indeed not legally binding, though a judge would strongly frown upon it if you brought it to court and we said something that contradicted it. 
USPTO is notoriously bad at finding prior art that is not in patents; they're limited in the techniques they can use and the databases that they search (in part because they need to maintain the confidentiality of applications, in part because of their workload and resources). I've personally seen several examples of issued patents that could have been invalidated if the examiners had seen all the published academic papers in the topic, which are much more accessible to their usual methods than most of the publication venues in the Bitcoin space. In an ideal world, just publishing--no RFC required--would be enough to get the effect we want, but it isn't.

["For the purposes of this pledge, enforcement for "defensive purposes" is an assertion of Patent Rights against a party who files, maintains, threatens, or voluntarily participates in any claim for patent infringement against Blockstream (including cross-claims and counterclaims), or against any other party based upon that party's use or distribution of technologies claimed in Blockstream patents or invented by Blockstream."](
@_date: 2016-07-20 01:31:07
Yes, they are bound by the pledge: "Blockstream intends this promise to be irrevocable and binding to the fullest extent possible, on itself and entities it controls (including any affiliates and/or subsidiaries) and on any entity that acquires an interest in these patents in the future." 
@_date: 2016-07-19 18:40:38
No. The DPL is there as an extra; it only applies to other DPL users (and we hope that others will choose to adopt the DPL even if they don't make a pledge to the general public). 
The rest of the pledge applies to anyone: we will not enforce our patents against competing implementations. We will only enforce for the named defensive purposes. 
(Edit, since it may not have been clear: these are two different types of licenses anyway--MIT and GPL are copyright licenses, and while some copyright licenses such as GPLv3 also contain explicit patent grants, most do not. The DPL is a patent license, and this strategy is only talking about the licensing of the patents. For the purposes of using the patents under either the DPL or the pledge, it doesn't matter which copyright license you use.
The software Blockstream produces is also available under free &amp; open source copyright licenses.)
@_date: 2016-07-19 21:17:58
Somewhat, yes. The mechanisms of the GPL don't translate perfectly to patents because of the differences between the legal mechanisms of patent and copyright (for example, the GPL depends heavily on the concept of "derivative works" in copyright, which isn't at all similar in patents), so getting similar effects requires a different mechanism. 
@_date: 2016-07-19 19:29:37
Answered [elsewhere in thread]( but no, implementations other than core will not be sued; this pledge is not specific to any particular implementation. The language of the pledge (and the MIPA, and the DPL) gives the right to use the patents to the public for any purpose and does not single out any particular use. 
@_date: 2016-07-19 16:46:53
If you read our FAQ, you'll see that we think that too! The patent pledge is just the first step. 
@_date: 2016-07-20 02:25:24
The pledge and the MIPA are both irrevocable; the DPL is revocable under certain conditions, but existing licensees would get an irrevocable license. If we tried to renege, anyone relying on our promises should be able to sue us and win. (The mechanism for this isn't putting it in the patents themselves; the language of the pledge states our intention of irrevocability and enforceability.)

The technology *is* open source, but that's frequently not enough--that covers the copyright, but it often provides either no promise or not enough of a promise about what happens to the patents. In particular, a lot of the software Blockstream produces is under the MIT license, which is very permissive--good for ensuring that the software can be widely adopted and integrated into many things without compatibility problems, not good for ensuring to users that any patents applying to that software are free for use, because it makes no explicit promises. (You can make the argument for an implied license, but that keeps law professors up at night.) Also, filing for patents and then releasing them to the public ensures that there is prior art that is available to the patent office so that others cannot claim the same thing and attempt to withhold it; challenging patents after issue because of prior art is a difficult and expensive process.
@_date: 2016-07-20 07:48:53
Under ideal conditions it would, but that's usually not how it works in practice--I answered [another question about prior art]( earlier. 
@_date: 2016-07-19 18:19:49
The licenses we offer (the DPL and MIPA) are not reliant on that enforceability doctrine, but for pledge enforceability the linked paper is a fairly comprehensive discussion.
@_date: 2016-07-19 17:10:42
(Just to be clear for others in the thread, this is from the MIPA, not the pledge itself--and it applies only to the patent applications which the inventor has assigned to Blockstream, which will usually only be things they did while employed there.)
@_date: 2016-07-19 23:35:30
Yes. (The pledge is written to apply to "on any entity that acquires an interest in these patents in the future"; the other commitments also continue to apply upon transfer.)
@_date: 2016-07-19 17:02:33
Lawyers are not generally good at tl;dr. :-)
But here's a shot: we've promised irrevocably that you can use Blockstream patents royalty-free unless you decide to threaten patent litigation against us (or downstream users); we are filing patents for defensive purposes to improve the situation over not patenting at all.

Greg's answer is correct.

Yes, but for more detail see some of my other comments on this post. 
@_date: 2016-07-19 17:50:14
See the FAQ for more discussion of this question. In general, promises can be enforceable through reliance (basically, someone made a promise, you acted reasonably based upon it, so you were entitled to rely on it). We also use the Defensive Patent License, give the inventors the right to sublicense through the modified IPA, and are open to offering individual licenses (even where they're not strictly necessary).
(There is a [long and worthwhile article]( about patent pledges and their enforceability if you're into that kind of thing.)
@_date: 2016-07-19 22:22:20
The DPL is an extra mechanism on top of the rest of the pledge for those who have chosen to adopt the DPL. The rest of the terms of the patent pledge apply to everyone, and do not require any sort of explicit acceptance (and apply only to patents applied for by and issued to Blockstream, not all Bitcoin development). 
Any patents can be disputed, regardless of who owns them or what terms they are offered under. However, it is usually difficult and expensive even in cases that should be clear-cut, which is why so many terrible patents go unchallenged. 
@_date: 2016-07-19 21:46:56
We cannot take back the promises we've made (you are entitled to rely on them). We may need to make new versions if there are errors, or we may also choose to make more promises that do not take any back.
@_date: 2016-07-19 21:20:56
Good point. Both of these documents are intended not to need changes (the FAQ may be updated), but probably a good idea to indicate.
