Good points. 
I personally believe BFX was negligent in setting up a security system that would be fit for such a financial behemoth, which allowed an insider to easily steal such amount.
Imagine if a huge customer showed up at your door and wanted your security filters. However, they also needed them to be:
1. Easily modifiable (because daily withdraw limits etc. can be reached with extraordinary daily traffic)
2. Fast (because nobody wants to wait on their money)
3. Easy to use.
For an exchange boasting as the "best," these are invaluable for attracting more customers, and all of them compromise the security.
Furthermore, BFX themselves said that BitGo was not the problem, right?

I'm not playing the judge, I'm showing people that they may waste their time suing BitGo, as you advised them.
You shouldn't sue companies that did not provide you with services, since you have no idea what was behind it all. All you know is that BFX lost your money. They can then sue BitGo however they want.

Haha, you actually seem really interested in my opinions, since you're always responding - you even sound agitated.
Good luck in your legal affairs, though methinks you're just gonna waste your time and/or money.

Did you store them there? Or did you entrust your money with BFX which stored them using BitGo? Huge difference.

Since BFX had "custom tailored" service from BitGo, I believe it's probable that they sacrificed security for comfort. 
Ergo, not BitGo's fault.

Not really. 
BFX paid them, not you. BitGo provides what you pay for, not what users of BFX expect, or what they provide usually.
I'm not saying that this is how it was, only a mere speculation - but that's what we all do here these days, with no info.

From how both parties react and what they are saying, I think BitGo is not the issue.
What we know is, that BFX had a custom (personalised) security solution from BitGo.
I can imagine that an exchange of their proportions and boasting with easy-to-use and fast service would want their security to be:
1. With easily modifiable limits (since you never know when you get huge daily traffic and you must not inconvenience the user)
2. Fast (customers don't want to wait on their money)
3. Easy to use.
All of these hugely compromise the security, and all of these are invaluable when attracting customers to your comfortable exchange.
