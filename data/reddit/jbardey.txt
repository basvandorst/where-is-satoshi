[bottlecaps]( are an alt coin and so can be sent over the internet like any other crypto.

Just hope you move faster than you message! =P

They just changed the difficulty retargetting to react more quickly to hashrate changes.
@_date: 2014-05-16 08:08:04
They could, but it would rely on a bug in the wallet that they can trigger and hopefully point the execution to their malicious code in the blockchain. A program *ordinarily* won't just start executing data as code.  
Edit; added the word ordinarily

Why? Create a new address (as you should be) and he can't find your BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:10:17
Yeah, it's a strange concept, and one that a lot of people probably don't fully 'get'.
The command line (bitcoind) or debug console (I think it's called from within bitcoin-qt) exposes extra functionality so you can e.g. specify your change address. 
In fact it looks like 'listaddressgroupings' would list all your change addresses.

I'd rather:-
1. Make a basic exchange get people to start giving you money
2. Establish a strong and reliable reputation
3. Take a small fee from every transaction for all time.
4. Profit.

It's about tx broadcast too. Nodes will reject a transaction if it's inputs are already in a pending tx, regardless of fee*. A tx propagates to 75% of the network within 2 seconds currently. 
\* Unless inputs/outputs match but now has a fee added which i believe is allowed, but that just to correct mistakes and won't let you send to a different address (outputs). This is fee replacement.

TL;DR pywallet should show you the hidden change addresses that have small amounts of your bitcoin.
I'm going to assume you sent some coins from bitcoin-qt to other wallets as part of your testing? This causes some of your bitcoins to get returned to you as 'change' and this goes to separate addresses recorded in your wallet.dat.
If you open an unencrypted wallet.dat with notepad you should see the hex representations of the change addresses (as the bitcoin-qt client generates 100 of these ahead of time and keeps them invisible in the GUI).
This [stackoverflow]( post kind of covers the same thing, and they recommend ['pywallet]( to show you the hidden addresses.
**Don't post parts of an unencrypted wallet.dat online, in case you inadvertently leak the private key**

Fee replacement? Unsure tbh.

Like I said, bug in the program. A well written program that validates it's inputs won't let this happen, typically people being careless with things like strcpy.
If I request a 64byte string, and allocate 64bytes of memory, I should damn well check I only get a 64byte string and don't overwrite parts of my program.
Edit; I see what you're getting at. You're continuing my last sentance. 'executing data as code unless, buffer overflow'.

Went through easily with BIC/IBAN on transferwise. Also cost less than my bank!
@_date: 2015-03-13 09:43:37
Okay, so the seller responded, but my bank tells me that their bank requires the full address of the bank and the recipient to make a transfer.
How can I get this information? Is this something you've run into before?
@_date: 2015-03-15 08:33:38
That was my understanding too. I phoned them and went into my local branch and they didn't seem very sure, so I might give  a go. 
Thanks guys.

Giving you guys ago, how many people have you had sign up for beta?
It doesn't feel very friendly once you're past the initial registration. I think some sort of first time helper would be great.
Currently got a buy order with the only seller there, hope it goes through.

No worries, it seems like a solid service that will facilitate transfer of bitcoins between private sellers.
Is there anything I need to do to collect the sign-up and 1st order bonus?
Some of the emails are VERY verbose and don't make it clear when action is required (almost missed the fact that I had to sign the transaction at the end).
But, at the end of the day it worked and the next time I buy (if there are anymore buyers) will be far smoother and quicker.  I hope I can provide any other feedback you guys need to making the process faster and smoother for others. Just let me know if you've got questions.
