Lightning is coming my friend.

It's a funny question. "Why are you worried about a couple hundred bucks" and my answer is because it's a couple hundred bucks. As many others I do this to make money and I will take every chance to make "a couple hundred bucks" more. To keep it simple. Even 1000001$ is better than 1000000$ ;-)

Yes I see... But still waiting...

I never said I sold any of my coins, but to buy more at lower prices. At the moment I've just got the feeling this thing is getting up too fast. And I really hope that there will be a chance to buy more Bitcoin for less money. Because one thing is sure. For the Long view prices will go to the moon

11133 now but still patient...
I stay with my opinion. It is not a healthy growth and it needs to get a correction. Maybe I'm wrong but it just seems too expensive to me to buy bitcoins at 11k (at the moment!).  In the beginning of 2017 you could by them for under 1000 bucks. If the rally continues it would be great but I'm not buying at these prices at the moment.

I'm also a huge Bitcoin fan but I don't think it will be used as a currency in future. As it's deflationary it will always be better stacking your bitcoins than spending them. Eg. if you can buy 1 car today with your Bitcoin, but you already know in two years it's going to be 2 cars what would you do? Bitcoin really is more like digital gold than a digital currency. And LN won't change that

True. I've done this

Ok Mr. Exception. But I hope you know extreme strong projects like iota are from Germany. And the non-regulatory politics from EU could also be a positive Aspekt for the crypto branch in Germany

That's true but it's not how humans in general work. We've always consumed more than we needed - since stone age. To change the whole system it needs a bit more than just one great invention (Bitcoin)

Now that all the whales from wallstreet and so on had to possibility to get in at very low prices, all bad news are gone. 
Let the rallye begin.

 A blockchain without a currency is definitely possible and  has a lot of use cases (as a special type of database).

For the long term it's never too late
