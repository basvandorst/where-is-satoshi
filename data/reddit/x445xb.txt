If you have to pay a $20 transaction fee to create a channel on the blockchain, then pay the same fee again to close the channel, doesn't that mean that people would have to have large LN channel balances in order to make it worthwhile?
If the cost of a Visa/Mastercard transaction is somewhere around 5% of the value transacted, wouldn't that mean that LN channels would need to transact at least $800 in order to cover the cost of a $20 LN open transaction and $20 LN close transaction. That would entail large sums being locked into LN channels and they would need to be long lived in order to make it worthwhile.
The majority of LN channels are going to be one way one, a customer paying a retailer. So all that money has to be put up by the customer at the start. Once the money in the channel has been spent the channel will need to be closed and a new one opened, hence paying the blockchain fees again.
I can see how the LN network makes recurring transactions cheaper, but its costs are still tied to the current blockchain transaction fees, which are way too high.

coinmarketcap uses a weighted average value based on the price and volume of various exchanges.
Some of the Korean exchanges are trading at much higher values than the US ones and are dragging the average price up.

Not really, the channels can stay open as long as you want. 
There are two ways to close a channel. One where both sides cooperate, in which case the channel is closed immediately and the coins available straight away. 
The other way to close the channel is when only one side wants to.  In that case the person will submit a transaction then have to wait a certain number of blocks before their coins become available. This gives the other party time to check that the transaction was valid and they can issue a revocation transaction and claim all the coins in the channel if the submitted transaction was invalid.

Wouldn't the majority of payments be one way only?
In my experience I only have one source of income (my employer) I then have multiple sources of payments (bills, food, shopping etc). My money would always be coming in one end and going out the other end. Depleting the channels and requiring new ones to be created.
The only way to create a balanced system would be if I had a channel with my employer. Then they would pay me my salary in each month and all my outgoing payments would be routed back out through the same channel in order to balance everything out.

With MD5 it is possible to generate a modified file without changing the hash. Hence a hacked file could have the same hash as a legitimate one. That's why it's not considered secure anymore.

That sounds perfectly normal.
If you take a leveraged position and the value of the position drops lower than 15% of the original they sell to market in order to stop it getting down to 0% or negative value losing the exchanges money.
If Bitfinex didn't do that people would be able to put up $1000 in their account then make a $2000 loss due to their trading and Bitfinex would end up $1000 out of pocket. Instead Bitfinex closes the position when it gets down to $150 so they don't lose any money, only the trader does.

Are you in a hurry? You could always set the transaction fee at a low value and just wait for it to clear.
This site is good at seeing what fee levels are getting processed:
If you put the transaction in at 70 satoshi's per byte then wait, there's a chance that it will get processed in a few days time. You can see that on the 11th December 70 satoshi/byte transactions were getting processed.

The way I understand it, there are 3 parts to a bitcoin address.
Private key -&gt; (Eliptic Curve Cryptography) -&gt; Public Key -&gt; (SHA256 + RIPEMD) -&gt; Bitcoin Address
The Eliptic Curve Cryptography is considered weak to quantum computing (using Shor's algorithm). However the SHA256 and RIPEMD step is considered resitant to quantum computing.
The public key only needs to be published when you actually spend coins. It can be kept a secret up until that point, other people only need to know your Bitcoin Address to send you coins.
As long as you don't re-use the same address after you have spent coins from it then no one else will know your public key and you will be resistant to quantum attacks. Wallets will normally empty all coins out of an address when you spend from it. Then transfer any left over change to a brand new address. So they are resistant to quantum attacks by default.

It's not so much 51% number of nodes that's important. It's the nodes that the majority of the people actually use that's important.
All the exchanges run their own nodes. If the Coinbase node didn't accept the 100 bitcoin block, then the miners won't be able to deposit their coins onto Coinbase. That means they can't trade them with anyone. The same would happen with other exchanges.
If no one is willing to pay them for the invalid blocks, then there wouldn't be any value in mining that fork. The miners would be wasting millions of dollars of electricity doing something that is worthless.
In order to do a hard fork like suggested, it would need support across most of the major exchanges and users of the network. That would only occur if the majority of users were willing to accept the change.

For any proof of work coin the energy usage is directly related to reward value. The actual hash algorithm or energy efficiency of ASIC chips is irrelevant.  
If a coin is giving out $100 million in block rewards every year, then miners will be willing to spend slightly under $100 million on electricity + hardware in order to claim that reward.  
More efficient miners just capture a bigger percentage of the total reward and force less efficient miners out of the network. They don't change the actual energy usage of the network.  
Proof of stake however is a different kettle of fish.

@_date: 2014-02-25 06:53:11
The problem would be avoiding double spend attacks. If both the user and the exchange know the private key, then the user could transfer BTC out of their address and at the same time execute a trade. The exchange could then be caught out having performed a trade without having enough BTC to cover it.    
So the exchange would have to move the money out of your private account and into their trade account first, wait for enough confirmations to avoid a double spend, then execute the trade.  
This would change the trading times from milliseconds to hours and people would be better off managing their own private wallets themselves, then transferring to the exchange a few hours before a trade.

It's not every single miner choosing the same transactions, each miner can choose whatever transactions they want to.  When a miner solves the block,  then they win and the transactions that they chose get to go into the blockchain.
They aren't all working on the exact same block. Every block has a transaction where all the fees and the block reward gets sent to an address.  Each miner will put their own address in so that they receive their reward. 
The problem they try to solve is creating a valid block with a hash that is less than a target value. The calculated hash will be a number between 0 and 2^256. In order to find one that is low enough,  they keep changing a small part of the block and then recalculating the hash. If they do that enough times they will eventually stumble across a hash that is lower than the target,  which means they win.

If SegWit becomes better adopted, then it will result in approximately 2MB block sizes (blocks up to 4MB are possible). We've already seen a 1.6 MB BTC block mined.
The compromise your asking for has already been included in the SegWit soft fork. The S2X fork would have allowed for an average 4MB block size (maximum of 8MB).
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:42:14
It still depends. Is it worth cashing out quickly if it's only 1/5 of the value? If the miners are really struggling to pay bills there are probably other SHA256 coins (neither BTC or B2X) that they could mine for better money and also cash out quicker.
Maybe some miners are willing to run at a loss in order to mine the B2X chain, but I don't think that the majority of miners will. 
If the BTC chain gets more than 50% of miners and also has the better coin value, then it's pretty much all over for the B2X side of the chain. Less reward, longer time to cash out etc. It could be a struggle for them to hit their difficulty adjustment block.

Lets say you have both coins in the same address and that you control the private key. You create 2 new addresses, address A and address B. You create a transaction to send BTC to address A and a transaction to send S2X to address B.
What I'm worried about is that when you send the first transaction to the network, someone will see that transaction and copy it to the S2X network. So your S2X coins will end up in address A. If you send the transaction to move S2X coins to address B, it will be rejected by the network because your first transaction was already copied to the S2X network and the coins have already been spent (the S2X coins are now in address A). You end up with both the coins in address A and you wasted a transaction fee but achieved nothing.
It seems like someone could intentionally cause problems and prevent people from splitting their coins. Unless there's some mechanism to prevent that from happening?

The blocks occur every 10 minutes. So it's 100 MB every 10 minutes. 14.4 GB every day. 5,256,000 GB every year. How long could they last with the block chain accumulating size like that?

It's possible for them to check that the transaction has made it to the mempool. Once that has happened then it's generally just a matter of time until it gets processed by a miner.
They are taking a risk that you won't simultaneously send the same bitcoins to a different address in a second transaction. (Double spend attack).
For small transactions, the effort of doing a double spend attack usually outweighs the benefits.
They can also spread your first transaction around to enough nodes and miners that any double spend transaction would get rejected by the time it makes it to the network.
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:42:47


What do you mean by that? The miner puts their own address into the first transaction of the block, so they receive the reward if the block gets accepted by the network.
It shouldn't matter who relays the block to the network, because the miners address is already in the block and the block can't be altered without having to be re-mined.

One of the main Australian exchanges calls it Bcash:
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:15:59
Yep, I get what your saying.   
Hypothetically, if BTC got only 20% mining support, but also managed to make it to the difficulty adjustment block (would take 10 weeks instead of the normal 2). Then the adjustment would make it 5 times easier to mine. If BTC still had 5 times the value of B2X at that point, then it would become 25 times more profitable to mine BTC.  
That would be a pretty big incentive for miners to switch back.  The mining should always follow the value of coin long term. It just depends whether low block rates and low transaction volumes have a flow on affect on the price. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:13:58

If the BTC chain is worth $7000 and the B2X chain is worth $1300 (what its futures currently trade for). Then the reward for mining a BTC block will be worth 5 times the reward for mining a B2X block. 
Both chains will start with the same difficulty level and will have to go through about 1100 blocks before a difficulty adjustment will occur.
So any miner who wants to make money will be mining the BTC chain because it will be 5 times more profitable. I think most miners will follow where the money goes. B2X will only win if it ends up being worth more money.
@_date: 2017-11-08 07:46:54
BTC is worth $7359 and difficulty is 1452 billion.  
BCH is worth $635 and difficulty is 113 billion.  
The BTC price per difficulty is $5.06 per billion difficulty.  
The BCH price per difficulty is $5.62 per billion difficulty.
It's more profitable for miners to mine BCH right now, so it makes sense that many are doing that.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:50:51
Probably not. The BCH difficulty adjustment algorithm benefits both coins. If BTC loses hashing power, BCH will gain hashing power. Then BCH will quickly adjust it's difficulty upwards until the hashing power goes back to the way it was.
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:00:21
There were problems 3 or 4 years ago when Scrypt mining pools started using algorithms to determine the most profitable coins, then put all their power towards those coins.
For some of these coins they would very quickly blast through the required blocks to trigger a difficulty adjustment. At that point the difficulty would adjust to be sky high and the mining pools would switch over to the next most profitable coin. This would leave these small coins 'stuck' with a high difficulty and not enough hashing power to reach their next adjustment blocks for a very long time.
I was worried about a similar situation happening between bitcoin and B2X or BCH. Where one of the coins would be left stuck with a high difficulty and not enough hashing power. However the BCH change should prevent this from happening, because it will adjust the BCH difficulty much quicker and even out the profitability between the two coins. (Even if the BTC difficulty takes much longer to adjust).
