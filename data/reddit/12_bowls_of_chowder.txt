Thanks for the detailed answer. This matches the feeling I get. I love the idea of Bitcoin and every few years I buy or sell a few thousand USD worth to stay in touch. I've made money overall. If I'd never sold any I'd be better off but then I wouldn't get to use it.

Well it has dogecoin that will be good enough for me I guess. ;)

You could add "actually wanting to own your device" to the reasons *not* to use iPhone. Apple has fairly consistently acted like you are licensing the phone from them and it's only yours so far as the law requires them to let you own it.
It seems like software and content are going to Noun-as-a-Service or subscription models and the tech companies are trying to do an end run around property rights. Apple and John Deere want to bring those shenanigans to physical items as well. It's pretty gross IMO.

Did these come in 25 BTC denominations? I remember holding a physical coin like that back when BTC first hit 500USD.

That's a fun way to think of it. So the idea, like e-mail, is for it to be ubiquitous but it isn't there yet.

Ford actually did try to do this. They denied warranty claims if you did a repair with non-Ford parts even if the warranty claim wasn't related to the non-Ford parts. Lucky for all of us the United State courts were smart enough to understand what was going on and rule against Ford. That's why you can buy a Wix airfilter for your Taurus instead of a Ford Motorcraft brand airfilter and still make a warranty clam when the breaks fail.
The courts are either too confused by devices like smartphones &amp; modern tractors or, like you, they just don't care and haven't ruled definitively in favor of the property owner when it comes your right to modify your iPhone or John Deere equipment.

Watched it twice and it seems like it's missing

I mean useful like credit cards and dollar bills are useful for consumer actions.
As far as the Bitcoin leaders are concerned should I be thinking of Bitcoin more like a credit card or more like an abstract financial instrument like a bond or something?

Interesting. So in the far future when BTC is really valuable there might be a market for "known clean BTC"? Like conflict free diamonds but actually verifiable?

Neat. I wonder if this will get more relevant as  more coins are tainted. Or less relevant because untainted coins are so rare they don't matter.

It take a little work to follow but not much more than say Fight Club. Which is aLso worth checking out if you haven't watched it BTW.
