Thank you for your post. I have a question of you since you have a long history in crypto and tech. Do you think BTC is headed in the correct direction? My personal opinion is that it is not, as the direction the core developer's have taken is away from Satoshi's intended vision. Having a $15.00 fee causes BTC to not serve one of it's main purposes. I get the "store of value" portion, but I feel progress is not in the right direction. Ultimately, what gives you confidence in BTC's future?

Fuck those scum bags. I hope  karma truly exists in this world so it can come back on their head.

You need to have a wallet with a public key that you will give the person to send the coins. Never give anyone your private key. I would do all my research and read up before I purchased a large amount of coins, so that you are fully able to secure them.

I reached out to them explaining my situation in its entirety with KnC and eventually they said "You are American so we really can't help you, sorry".

Can you tell me more about how you have your wallet set up with 2FA and pinging you without being an on-line one? I am interested in your entire wallet security set-up.

Here is the context of my correspondence on their site.

They did say that if I was a citizen of a European country they could do more for me if I remember correctly. It basically boiled down to the EU consumer laws just protecting only citizens of those countries.

Just to update you, this does shows on my account when I sign into Coinbase, so it is legit.

Did you respond to it yet? I responded asking them what their definition of high volume is.

It's like I'm reading what is currently going on with KNC right now.

HODL and buy some cool shit from NewEgg.

I wish there was more focus on KNC Miner than GAW. KNC has actually scammed the shit out of a lot of people with their last generation of Bitcoin and Alt miners. I have a net positive return with money I have spent with GAW. I will never be able to say that with KNC. They straight up took an interest free loan to build their mega mining facility up and then did not follow through with their commitments.

I moved a 401K from an old employer over to my uncle that has a Raymond James office. First thing I said was I want to put $20,000 into GBTC @ a limit buy of $125. He then proceeds to tell me that Raymond James doesn't let them trade in those securities. I lile to text him every once in a while asking if he has seen the price of GBTC lately. Fucking shit qould be over $100K now. I have been talking to him about BTC for years. He still doesn't get it...we have a long way to go still.

There was some serious drama mini-series years back called The Slap. This is just skit making fun of it.

I agree they are being very shady. I was eventually able to get coins out of there, but it waa significantly less than what you have on their site. It took many times contacting support. Something is not right over ther...I wont be putting coins on their exchange anytime soon.

At least take a portion and get some of the top 10 crypto's. I wouldn't put it all in Bitcoin, as it now more than ever could end up overtaken by another coin.

Really? I have had the same issue and they have been completely un responsive ignoring my replies to initial tickets and will not unlock my account.
@_date: 2015-10-22 23:44:26
I would love to pull my coins out, but I am currently locked out...
