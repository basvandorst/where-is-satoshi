 I'm just saying that even if $558m worth of BCH goes to $0 they have plenty of money to operate.

I buy weekly a set amount from GDAX. There is no fee if you use limit orders and a bank deposit. It takes like a week for your funds to clear, so I just set a reminder on my calendar to make the transfer every Friday. Once it's cleared I place a limit order. No easy way to automate it, but takes 30 seconds to do. You could write an AHK script if you wanted.

How does bitcoin dodge all those logs on the coaster? 
@_date: 2018-05-05 14:03:58
60% of the time it works every time
@_date: 2018-05-26 00:35:26
cool video! The growth feels so organic

He is looking at how he values company's and he is right, bitcoin doesn't intrinsic value through those glasses. But IMO bitcoin value is that it has no value. Nothing dictates it. No government body, no company earnings. So it is a counter value for when other items or currencies are compared to it. Bitcoin is a unit less standard.

I tried to read the article but I couldn't stop staring at the gaping hole in his nose. 
@_date: 2019-08-14 15:10:28
So what will happen to bitcoin's price if the dollar doesn't have any inflation? Recession incoming

It actually was created, by Satoshi... I'm saying people value it for its use incase of a apocalypse. I simply don't see that being worth much. It's P2P transactions I can value in though. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:50:06
Thanks I will give this a try!
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:51:20
For real. I'm tempted to create my own eBay  and payments will be in crypto only and purchase risk will be defined before purchase. Also their fees are ridiculous. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:29:08
Ah good point. I sold some with psu and used the same ad and forgot to do that. He hasn't mentioned anything about the missing power supply though. But I will contact him again and see if I can send him a power supply. 
@_date: 2019-01-13 20:16:37
One thing that is never mentioned in the Bitcoin vs new tech is the fact that Bitcoin evolves over time constantly, it is nothing like a model T. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 00:14:30
I understand I messed up the pictures and have reached out to him and will supply one. However, he never mentioned anything about the power supply. He simply wrote "Not powering on". Which implies he must have had some power supply. So I asked how he is powering it and gave him some advice and I never received a response.  Then 4 days later he submits a claim.  Also, just noticed he is no longer registered on Ebay anymore... Lets see if he replies to my email..
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:49:21
Do you think I covered myself enough in the ad? 
@_date: 2018-03-20 00:17:49
Good Advice thanks!
