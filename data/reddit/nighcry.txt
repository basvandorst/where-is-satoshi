I will tell you why I don't believe in bit coin as much as I use to. The reason is simple. Why would I add value to the currency that is currently in possession of that fucking thieving scumbag? Why? Let someone make a proper bitcoin fork which addresses some of those concerns and I will sign on. Id actually be happy if governments releases their own crypto currencies so people could get some protection from criminals along with all the advantages of legal system to protect consumer. Wouldn't it be cool if that piece of shit had all those stolen coins invalidated by a court with a push of a button?

You know what blows my mind is how no one said "make sure you withdraw your coins from the exchange after you buy it". I honestly feel so stupid for ever trusting in that fucking exchange and not getting my coin out. Fucking scammers. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:56:38
I don't see how an exchange (the largest one of them all) could have missed the fact that they said they held 850k coins, but in fact had only 20k. Even if they only held 800k, a 50k difference would surely be noticeable by A GRADE FUCKING ONE MATH TEACHER. So no one will tell me "THEY DIDN'T KNOW FOR YEARS". It makes not fucking sense. Even casinos count their chips. They fucking knew! And for whatever reason, decided to go bankrupt because of whatever shady business practices they engaged in with other people's money.

What blows my mind is how they had it good. I mean the largest fucking exchange at the forefront of the up and coming technology. What an amazing position to be in. Why on EARTH would they just throw it all away like this? I mean to do what a money grab and run? It just doesn't make any sense to me that they would kill the golden goose. It feels like an illogical move for sure to antagonize the entire Bitcoin community and basically completely discredit bitcoin with all this negative news. It makes no sense to do this from business perspective AND it almost feels like a sabotage. Maybe they want to help destroy bitcoin for some reason? I am not much for conspiracy but this is what it feels like.

Yah. There should be some kind of a clearing house run by an authority which can do some kind of a reversal or invalidate transactions. Like with credit cards. This guy could never steal so much using people's credit cards. If you think about the numbers you are talking about 6 percent of all coins in existence are now in possession it this 1 piece of shit. So he is just gonna sit back and watch as r/bitcoin now keeps pumping him money with the propaganda.

@_date: 2014-02-10 17:20:05
So what the fuck is the bottom line here? No bitcoins can be withdrawn from MtGox "for now". How long is that "for now" going to last? Where does that live people like me who had Bitcoin with Mtgox? They got NO ETA on when withdrawls will resume. I don't care what kind of bug they got in their system, I want my bitcoin and I want it now. This is so fucked up it is beyond belief. What's the point of selling people fucking YUBIKEYs and all the cold storage security shit, when they wont even provide people with what is rightfully theirs. 
I hope they realize what they just did to their brand = completely destroyed reputation and trust, over what? This shitty excuse with the bug? I feel like this whole thing is just one big lie, it just doesn't make sense to cause such huge panic in the market because of bug in protocol which they can easily work around with. No, this doesn't make slightest bit of sense. I have a feeling this is a pure market manipulation to drive the price down or they just want to bail with customer's money and coin.

Sounds like a reasonable explentation. What I don't get is how they can SELL bitcoin without having the coin stored to back up every purchase transaction. That is regardless of their bank account, they should still have all the coins people purchased available for them to withdraw. I mean it is insaine to sell something you can not deliver. I am idiot for keeping the coins with them to begin with, but I thought since they are so big and since they have all this infrastructure for security it would be a safe place to keep em.

The more I read about the Bitcoin (which is A LOT in last few days) the more glaring some of the issues with it become. I found this comment by "meyb1984" which I find very compelling posted for The Guardian article (
I find the BITCOIN concept an interesting one and have recently been following the story of its rise over the last month. However, I can’t fail to note that the majority of individuals so vehement in its defence have the pang of the BITCOIN investor, speculator or wistful anarchist. Whilst there are problems with fiat financing, and there are many, this does not immediately imply that BITCOIN is the moral or economic solution to the problem.
Two fundamental flaws to BITCOIN from an economic sense, one it is deflationary and two it is not a currency.
The deflation argument is simple, whilst too much inflation is bad, deflation is worse. One example is it destroys the ability for workable contracts to be written. Take a simple example, if I took a mortgage in BITCOIN at the start of the year on a house worth $500,000 at the rate of $10/Bit, at today’s rate I would now be $7,500,000 in debt and bankrupt. This flaw will hinder BITCOIN ever being used on a larger scale. So who wins with BITCOIN: the wealthy who can take the risk, hold BITCOIN and speculate on the price, not the average individual.
Secondly to call BITCOIN a currency you have to fundamentally be able to use it to process transactions readily and easily, a handful of obscure and questionable sites are not sufficient. BITCOIN is more akin to a commodity (a bad one at that as it has no intrinsic value) where BITCOIN users predominantly use it as a transfer of value which is virtually cost free, untraceable and fast. This is probably its biggest value but to call it a currency would be wrong. If the credibility of the exchanges were to disappear BITCOIN will be useless as is not backed and has no wide value without concurrent valuation against legal tender from the exchanges. I recently read one BITCOIN magazine recently and whilst I found it informative in many ways I observed one amusing irony: the magazine was valued in US dollar, without a parallel BITCOIN price; if BITCOIN can’t price their own magazine in BITCOIN surely that says something about its usability?
I’ll end this on the morality note. Forget the questionable sites and use of BITCOIN which has plagued it, but what I find most disparaging is that BITCOIN is touted as the solution to the central bank problem currently in countries where people are struggling with the fiat system and who are frightened. But what are they really selling as the alternative? BITCOIN is an extremely illiquid, volatile investment with no asset backing. To me it sounds like profiteering and kicking a man when he’s already down. If BITCOIN fails there will be a lot poorer individuals that took BITCOIN as a safe haven and many rich speculators who already will have cashed out. Whilst central banks have failed, the ingenuity of BITCOIN is unarguable, and the future no doubt will involve a virtual currency, this by no means gives BITCOIN an automatic moral mantle or secures it current viability.

How? Look you can not possibly have a currency at $200 at such early stages and expect any businesses to start trading in it. It is just too unstable. It makes a good gamble but thats about it. Without a real solid economy (you know - people buying and selling shit) no one will adopt it. The realativly few people who are hording bitcoin in hopes of it ever going that high are basically deluded. Money is debt, how can some dude with few thousand bitcoins all of the sudden claim millions of dollars of that debt? Based on what? For the currency to hold any value whatsoever people are going to have to be using it on big scale. So far the only real place where it has any value is on some shady corners of the Internet. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:03:31
If you haven't noticed there is a clear pattern in those price spikes. If enough momentum builds up after major news, people start buying / selling and it snowballs because a very clear price trend develops. So this China thing will die down eventually and there might be positive or negative news emerging.. in a long run its a great technology. the problem is people buy and sell it for wrong reasons, right now it all seems to be about buying and holding as an investment, rather than a payment instrument.

Got the same vibe from it as others. He advocates gold cause his business is gold and precious metals. The only thing I took out of that whole speech would be the fact that "intrinsic value" is not there. I think what he is referring to is a MATERIAL value to those who use in production, like making jewellery and certain industrial applications. I for one find very little value in an ounce of gold other than what people are willing to pay for it.
I don't have a degree in economics but I think he is wrong with the whole intrinsic value part. He clearly contradicts himself with saying that of course resources are spent with mining gold as resource and then concluding that one has intrinsic value and the other does not. 
It takes real energy and resources to mine bitcoin (as with gold) and the intrinsic value of gold is derived from how much work has to be performed in finding and mining it. (As you can see on pretty much any episode of the Gold Rush on the Discovery Channel)
The value of gold is derived not only from its actual scarcity or the fact that it is rare. It is mostly derived from the level of work and difficult of finding and mining it. There is plenty of gold within Earth's crust that if you only had infinite resources for digging quickly, you could quickly devalue it quite quickly. 
So as with gold, the intrinsic value of bitcoin is derived from work it takes to get it as well as what people are willing to pay for it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:04:14
1. I don't disagree that the coins can be split and bought. I am just arguing that their actual value is overinflated and people will simply not be willing to purchase at those prices while they could just keep on using dollars. Just as an investor doesn't want to purchase at an overinflated price, neither do business owners and non-investors. Saying simply the early-entry to the market gives a small group disproportionately large slice of the pie. 
2. No disagreement there. There could be brokrages in between of transactions, but that infrastructure isn't there yet.
3. With a credit card you can associate a number to a specific individual because of card-issuing bank records. With bitcoin you can't. They can claim to be anyone - their bitcoin address will not confirm their identity.
5. If a bank account is broken into, there are limits on what the intruder may be able to do. For example you may not wire out above specific limit. If you do process some transaction there are records which show where the money came from and where it went. Most of all there is insurance. So if someone steals your credit card and uses it, your bank will refund the fraudulent charge. No such thing with Bitcoin. If they break in (as was a case with Mt.Gox) they can just steal all the coins in one shot. This may not seem like a big deal when it comes small transactions for an individual, but for businesses it could be tens of thousands of thousands of dollars. The cost of security and infrastructure for sustaining and securing on-premise bitcoin bank would be huge.
6. Because USD is widely accepted and used for anything and everything whereas historically Bitcoin is predominately known for being used within black markets (Silk Road) Tor, etc for all kinds of questionable transactions. I am not saying this alone would be a good argument for not using it for business, but I feel like there are plenty of others that will keep businesses from getting in on it.

I've learned a lot from the past week just observing the madness. One has to ask a fundamental question here: What was driving the price up so high? If there is no sound economy behind it, if the value of the coin didn't change in any fundamental way over night. Thousands of stores didn't start accepting bitcoin overnight. Then why are people paying so much for it and driving numbers even higher? It is pure greed, hope for easy money - hope that these coins will be worth thousand, hundreds of thousands or millions... Hope that the coins are and will be very valuable not because of their utility now, but scarcity.
No one bought the coins with an intend to spend them.
But looking at the reality of things in order for this new currency to be viable it needs to be 1) Affordable 2) Competitive. Affordable for businesses to acquire and actually use for purchases / sales and competitive that is better than an alternative (ie. regular dollars) At $260 a pop the currency is anything but affordable and with wild price fluctuations and instability it is anything but completive. The infrastructure behind bitcoin is practically non-existant and it will take a long time for serious businesses to start adopting it. Another words: huge gamble. It obviously has its pluses, but greedy people have gone bonkers over it and got burned. 
 As Charles Ponzi correctly pointed out a century ago: What causes intelligent people to lose fortunes? The main factors are the same ones that cause people to be conned in general: trust and greed.
