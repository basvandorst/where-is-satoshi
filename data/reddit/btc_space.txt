That probably assumes the price of gold stays at current levels or goes up.

That would be epic. I'd contribute to that purchase. A smart contract on the blockchain, with investors compensated over time as the mine operates and generates revenue.

I would suggest perhaps Bitcoin is almost irrelevant, instead we could say that pandora's box has been opened, Bitcoin was the first iteration or vehicle that delivered us to an understanding of what the blockchain is and its implications in terms of decentralizing global systems. Bitcoin as a method of transmitting money is just the first expression of the power of the idea behind Bitcoin. 
I would imagine Marc Andreessen is mindful of importance of  reaching a broader audience, I think the way in which he spoke is certainly catered towards reaching the masses, and I commend him for it.

In the listing, the seller clearly states that full financial disclosure is available to interested buyers. Obviously no one is going to buy an empty gold mine, there will be a due diligence process just like with any purchase.
I think it's fantastic to see the relationship between Bitcoin and precious metals begin to develop. It's probably not easy to be a regular guy like Tim and get trolled so hard from the very same community he is trying to enter in to. If the trolls in this thread had any sense, you would be welcoming the precious metals community into the crypto currency space with open arms, and not making baseless accusations. 
According to the article, Tim has 30 years of experience mining gold. I don't think anyone could make it as a miner in a small, tight knit community in the Yukon territories if you weren't honest and didn't have integrity. He's been mining and selling gold for three decades and now wants to transition into Bitcoin. I think that's cool and wish him all the best.
