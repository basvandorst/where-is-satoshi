If a few people can do this attack, then Bitcoin failed as an experiment and we can all go back to fiat.
I believe this is just the market speaking. The WHOLE market, not just a few people like you guys think

I switched all my 120btc to bch when they were 600usd. I can tell you this is not an attack but btc just has been unusable for the last few months for me

L2 and L3 will cause centralisation.... onchain will cause it to be decentralised. Why can't you comprehend that?

I believe btc is 100% centralized

It went back to 300 because many companies made the mistake to sell off their bch after the fork. Now most companies hold so I believe this bubble won't pop

To be honest, today's btc price is the lowest it will ever be. If people are annoyed they didn't buy btc before, they should now. If they don't, in 5 years they'll say "damn I wish I bought btc when they were at 4k$"
