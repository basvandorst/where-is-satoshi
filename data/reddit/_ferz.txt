You actually told people to buy? Nice one dumbass.
I had friends asking me if they should "invest" their whole life savings into Bitcoin when it was making the news and soaring to 20K. They didn't know a damn thing about it. I simply told them NO, like any rational person would do. I linked several articles for them to read, to learn about the tech, market, etc., so they can make up their own mind. Sure enough, Bitcoin crashed. And they were warned that it's highly speculative asset to gamble all your savings with. 
I'm never salty on my speculations, but I'd never give out any advice to anyone else because this is how you end up gambling with someone else's money. Keep it to yourself ffs.

You tell them to do their own research. You can also tell them if you are long or short on some things, and why. You don't make a decision for them, and you always tell them that there's a good chance they are going to lose their money. That's all you say if it comes down to it. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 13:18:13
You'd be speculating, not investing. Put all your money in it, when the market goes below 6K again after this pump and dump, hopefully you'll learn a valuable lesson.

Who knows if it will last.. but I think it's a good rally to test the price. It feels like the last one was triggered by the hype, for months I've been reading that Bitcoin is going to the moon and then news coverage near the New Years and so on. It felt rushed and expected. This one is breaking out from a fairly steady pace. I don't know what the reason for this rally is but it feels like the market might test a new high around 1K. Chances are it will stay like this for a week and then who knows. We'll see. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 05:59:47
Hm, I actually don't remember if I did this or not. I know I uploaded my license for Circle. If anything its probably has to do with recent IRS ruling. 
Which actually makes me question some things. Is it better to use Coinbase to buy Bitcoin or it's better to use an exchange like Poloniex or Kraken? With Coinbase it's instant via debit card, I wonder if exchanges are comparable, if so I'd probably just go over to an exchange at this point.

I've used [these guys]( since they have an ATM in my town. This is what they claim on the website.


I am not affiliated with them, just used their ATM before. Selling Bitcoins was easy and the price was at current market value. I think it's much more expensive to actually buy Bitcoin via that ATM. Perhaps this is how they make their money, because selling felt pretty easy and lucrative right at what Mycelium wallet quoted me.

Seems that way. I've asked about this multiple times too. I just don't understand how people can pull statistics out of their... rear. 
The next best thing I've found is fiatleak website that shows real time transactions. China did have a really big volume until the recent ruling, now it seems like US volume is very close to China, with ups and downs. Of course I'd love to see a more accurate data over a certain period of time. One can hope.

IDK, this is the first time where I am not sure about future stability. The price have been in the uptrend for awhile but went down recently. On the news as well, looks like it. Since I don't hold a lot money in Bitcoin and my financial situation right now is very shaky, I am liquidating my several hundred. I'll reinvest when I'll be able to afford more with a better job.

Because 0.056 means absolutely nothing to me when most prices are in USD where I am at. The same way 5000 rupeees or 4500 rubles tells me nothing. I need to convert them to USD to see the value of the item. When we move to Bitcoin worldwide and prices in BTC become a second nature then 0.056 would mean something.

But it can go both ways right? If SW becomes a success on LTC then BTC should break out of current price because it would be next. I don't see how it won't be activated on BTC. There are skeptics right now and community is split but if it's proven to work then what would hold BTC back exactly? Just politics, which would look petty if the SW concept succeeds with LTC. BTC might take a hit in a short term but LTC just doesn't have the users, holders, vendors, ATMs, even coinbase support, etc. LTC might be ahead right now on implementing SW but it doesn't have anything else that would make people jump the ship. I almost bought LTC this weekend but to me it's useless, can't spend it, why bother then?

The trend is still not to "sell". It's a pretty light drop, it feels like a lot but if the whales were dumping it would be at 1000 or less by now. It's just a dip, which is typical. I'd expect some major news for a trend to reverse into bear market. But then again, I might be missing something this week since I have tendency to buy and forget since I am bullish overall.
@_date: 2017-01-18 19:26:59
That could work if I was spending a considerable amount of money with Bitcoin. I save most, and do small purchases. I think a lot of people do the same and demanding new payment option for very very few people is not going to worth the effort for most vendors. 
But it's a good proposition and something to keep in mind. I'd be interested in having a poll or some general statistics on what people spend their Bitcoin on, or where they spend money online constantly, that way more people could target and request payment option for something that is going to be a "sure thing" for the vendor.

I am personally concerned about 1 thing and it's whales crushing Bitcoin. Here's hypothetical scenario, and by all means critic it, debunk it even so I can have a peace of mind. 
So let's say Bitcoin takes off (beyond of what we have, because it's doing pretty damn good). Talking about funds pouring in from corrupted countries, as a safe haven; normal folks looking into it because it's trending; businesses starting to add Bitcoin payments, like major ones, think Starbucks and McDonalds, everyday purchases for average Joe.
Prices goes up, "to the moon", we are almost there, technology is succeeding, even 3rd world countries are happy to use Bitcoin because it's stable. But, here's the kicker. Whales are coming in board. Big time speculators. We are talking of George Soros caliber (again, hypothetical just to demonstrate the point). They are buying large, price sky rockets, the 1% is on board as well. 
Now, what makes Bitcoin secure from crashing? Everyone is in and happy. Price is up. But what if the big whales decide to dump their coins and cash out in fiat? Why wouldn't they? Government has their backs. Those are the lobbyists, the ones who don't care about Bitcoin and technology, those are the people who want to cash in on the bull market and pump and dump. So they have the ability crash the price to the point of panic selling from the people. But where does this leave the regular folks? They will be left out in the dust. The 1% will come on in for a "ride to the moon" but they are not there for the long haul, they don't care about decentralization of money. They will speculate, make their fiat money because this is where it's the most secure for them, and then they will short Bitcoin like there is no tomorrow. All the regular folks who thought, "future is here and now, we won" will end up losing money and fiat will stay king. 
I mean in short, what prevents big whales swaying the price to the point of uncertainty and panic selling to the point of disillusionment from the general public? I can guarantee you that not everyone is all about that technology and the future of decentralized currency, people don't know any better. 
Do you understand what I am getting at? Maybe I am missing something? 
@_date: 2017-01-15 19:17:01
It looks like the value of other coins are heavily tied to Bitcoin. At least when Bitcoin was going up last several weeks, all the other cryptos started to gain as well. Now that Bitcoin is going down, the rest are losing value too. Looks like Bitcoin is still the leader and dictates the trend for crypto technology. I wouldn't even know what the second best is right now. Is it ETH? Monero? Something else? No idea.

You guys are joking but I think there's something bigger going on, and it's pretty great because it shows something. This is how I look at it, I was hodling but at the same time I was getting a little pissed about fees and transaction times because it felt like Bitcoin is up for upgrade, anything, I was using it pretty frequently to buy stuff online. Here's the thing, this Bitcoin split is showing something else. Bitcoin is not winning as a cash replacement (fortunately or unfortunately), it is winning as a better store of value. At this point Bitcoin is digital gold rather than currency. And I know that people have said it before and what not. I just think this split actually showed what people want and how they use it. There are more people who use it as investment and store of value, than those who use it as currency and require fast transaction times and rooting for bigger block to accomplish it.

Uh yeah... you are speculating with 10K with some other factors involved. But it's really up to you. I've followed Bitcoin since it was 1 buck or so and I am still kicking myself for not buying it, but it was more of a money issue (broke student, couldn't really buy something like that at the time). Recently I got back into it when BTC was under 700, now we're here. I still don't have any serious or even decent money in Bitcoin but I am playing with it, learning, watching the market. I do think that it's got a pretty good potential (I understand the tech and implications a little better now) and if I had more cash to put into Bitcoin, I would. So to answer your question.. it's up to you, it's your money, nobody can tell you what to do with it. But yes, there are plenty of downsides and unexpected variables. I've been buying $100 worth every paycheck and I've been actively using BTC too, bought several items for Xmas. The real question is how much can you put in and tolerate if BTC happens to crash tomorrow. I am prepared to take a loss and perhaps even ride it out, are you with your 10K?

Hm, maybe the other person can open a Circle account and receive the cash from you? You should be able to send fiat, but I am not sure if Circle will require verification of account before accepting your transfer. But I see your problem, I didn't like Circle to begin with because it took 2 weeks to have everything set up and get Bitcoin and all that. I don't like waiting myself. Hope you can figure something out.
@_date: 2016-12-08 04:09:15
Sure, I'd love to believe this but some experienced speculators can make some big swings that will scare the average Joe who will not thinking that "it will rebound". Average person is more inclined to go back to the "known", which is fiat, thinking of Bitcoin as another fail and a bubble.
It might be a bad example but it reminds me of Jesse Livermore plunging during the '29 crash to the point of JPMorgan calling him and telling him to slow down (allegedly). The thing is, everyone was on the stock market game back then so everyone was supposed to be happy right? But it's not how it went. 
I am just worried that "big guns" will get on board and use Bitcoin as another opportunity to pump and dump instead of sticking with it and revolutionizing the monetary system.

It's not optimal, and it goes against Bitcoin philosophy. But.. these are being installed obviously by commercial businesses. I honestly was prepared for worst. Some BTC-ATM posts here are even more awful, saw as high as 15% fees.

First time using Bitcoin, so far a very pleasant experience. Paid for a new hosting from namecheap and bought Ledger wallet. I like the ease of transactions, scan the QR, confirm, see the page auto-updated in split second to completed transaction. 
@_date: 2016-11-09 06:51:34
No, I understand. It just feels shitty to get in on something and miss by a fraction (more or less). 
I am not a wizard but I felt that Bitcoin would move up during elections but unfortunately I didn't get the funds on time. I am still bullish on it overall.

What "valuable service" is that? It goes against Bitcoin and the whole philosophy of it. People preach here daily how Bitcoin is the future and it's so much better than everything under the sun, but when others point out that there are certain problems that negates the whole idea of Bitcoin, we have folks going "they're providing a valuable service, not running a charity. Whining about fees when you know what they are is retarded." Oh, okay, brb, going back to the bank and using their services then. Don't be whining when nobody adopts Bitcoin, because "where is mah adoption, people are stupid and should be educated about Bitcoin" ain't going to cut it with BTC ATM fees sitting at 12%, this is absurd.

It's fucking incredible... my luck that is... 1 week before Bitcoin shot up several years back I was a paycheck away from purchasing. I haven't messed with Bitcoin since because of the price, but just purchased some from Circle last week. Sure enough, it's taking fucking several days for transaction to complete which will be on the 10th. Price right now is up... by the time I get my Bitcoin I will probably buy at high and the price will drop back to 700. Amazing. 
@_date: 2016-11-20 02:09:49
I think it's pretty impressive sitting at 12 billion, compared to some well established dominating corporations. I haven't checked your stats for factual information but if your numbers are right then I feel like Bitcoin has a pretty good future ahead.

No they are not. Kremlin is highly averse to Bitcoin simply because one of the biggest issues in Russia is the capital flight from the country. Bitcoin might thrive underground there but authorities will be on the look out for it, especially after "Yarovaya's packet" passed not long ago.

I personally bought Ledger Unplugged, it was a little under 30 bucks, paid in Bitcoin. Set it up today with my Android phone and Mycelium. Don't need USB, just a phone with NFC. Which suits me perfectly, just enough to get going. Put a Ledger card (wallet) in my wallet and I am good to go. Never leave the house without phone, keys and wallet. 
Can't vouch for other options as of yet. If I ever get more money in BTC then I might get something more expensive and richer in functionality but for right now I am happy with my purchase.

Is there any reading you can recommend to learn about all this in detail? I am fairly savvy with technology, can code some scripts when needed, but when it comes to Bitcoin and everything related I feel a bit overwhelmed because I am not even sure where to begin at learning all concepts, jargon, issues, and current politics. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 01:47:43
I am just curious that if we remove the bots that are there to game the market with HFT, what would we be left with? Would China still be a major player in Bitcoin or the field would narrow down and have more reasonable USD/Yuan proportions (because right now it seems like China is the key player that will affect the future)? I'm guessing we would be left with people who are a) actually believe in technology and cryptocurrency and b) those who are investing.

Yeah, exactly, how does that help Bitcoin again? We are talking about new tech that is highly speculative. So what exactly keeps whales from speculating, pumping and dumping when it's hot, and then exiting? Their safe haven is somewhere in Switzerland, with fiat or some other diversified investments, not Bitcoin. Conservative investors are not jumping on trends and new tech, what makes you think that Bitcoin will be something that 'big money' will hold on to as investment for profit?
@_date: 2016-12-14 00:32:37
Chances are, it's going to be bad for Bitcoin. Navalny is not well liked (besides the edgy Russian memesters) and this will cause some controversy, which it will, because I am guessing Navalny is going to raise a good amount of cash considering that donations can be received from all over the world. And this will pretty much trigger Kremlin into bashing Bitcoin, not only because of Navalny's persona, but the fact that mainstream media will spin it to claim that Navalny was sponsored by US NGOs through Bitcoin. The government also has a problem with capital flight so having a smear campaign against Navalny and Bitcoin would be like killing two birds with one stone.

How is this possible? I've used coinbase once, but I bought ETH through them because I already hold BTC. I opened account and verified everything within 30 minutes, literally. Made a purchase and had my ETH in the wallet in less than an hour. Am I missing something? Does Bitcoin transactions work differently? So many people claim problems with coinbase and I am not sure why. The only problem I've encountered with them is their payment system that 3rd party businesses use, I get some weird error. But BitPay works fine. That's about it.

I am also the type of person who can afford the 'useless' amount of money to invest in BTC. But I do spend it as well. I bought electronics, holiday gifts, hostings, vpns, got some cash from BTC ATM, etc, etc. To me, it's just another "account" that banks don't offer. It's an investment and a risky gamble that I can afford to engage in. But then again, I play poker, most of my Bitcoins come from online poker cash outs. Overall I think Bitcoin is +EV, as in, positive expected value given all the variables, I do believe in the blockchain and its' principles now after using Bitcoin. Plus, if I put money in Bitcoin, I spend less on stupid stuff and indulgences. Putting money in BTC makes me more conservative with my cash, as paradoxical as it sounds. With that said, I think Bitcoin is doing fine.
@_date: 2016-11-20 02:40:57
Sounds interesting. Do you have any? Do you think the price will go beyond $10 per ETH? It looks like market has been resistant to have the same rally as BTC in early days.

And why exactly is Ethereum is a good currency? I am pretty new to this whole cryptocurrency thing but Bitcoin makes sense to me thus far. Ethereum has some smart contracts that you can customize or something? I am really not sure. How does ETH is better than BTC at the movement or the future? I actually used BTC for purchasing, ETH not yet. I am genuinely curious why you say Ethereum is a better solution. Do you hold any?

And what don't you understand about it? You think out of all governments, Kremlin is going to be happy to allow Bitcoin? I've been saying the same thing every time "good news from Russia" come out about Bitcoin. Kremlin is terrified that capital might leave Russia. Bitcoin is a good medium for that, thus there is no way they are going to allow it. So it makes perfect sense for them to appear "progressive" by providing some alt shit coin that is government controlled instead. Your average Russian is not going to care about implementation because the media is just going to say that it's "revolutionary" and better than Bitcoin. Smart people will still continue to use Bitcoin like they do now, but the average public is going to use what the state gives them.

I actually enjoyed spending Bitcoin when I had it. The minute people started to 'hodl' and community split between lightning vs bigger blocks, I sold it. Call me stupid but I actually believed and used the technology prior to this bullshit. I don't want to 'hodl' anything, I want to go out and spend my Bitcoin the way it was meant to be. So far the 'hodlers' are the biggest hypocrites because they want to cash in on the profit like it's a stock. "To the moon on my Lambo herp derp", via selling Bitcoin for dollars...

Some people around here are weird. They celebrate Bitcoin that "surely will replace dollar". But they question everyone who is using it as a currency right now. "Why would you buy that if in 10000 years it's going to be worth trillions, you paid billions for a burger." Who gives a shit? The price can crash tomorrow and you managed to buy a meal today for pennies, whoopty doo. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 05:29:06
I wouldn't count too much on it. If I know one thing about Kremlin, it's that they are terrified of capital flight. I am very skeptical about Putin-Buterin meeting, or whatever happened with "ETH endorsement". And recently I saw that Kremlin wants to ID everyone who is using Bitcoin or something like that. 
The bottom line is that I know Russia fairly well and it might look like good news to foreigners, but there are strings attached when it comes to crypto in Russia. Kremlin is just not going to welcome it with open arms if it's anonymous. They don't want capital flight, and it's a very good medium for that. So we'll see how it goes.
Also, Moscow Times is liberal and Western leaning publication, it's critical of Kremlin and I highly doubt it reflects actual realities when it comes to Bitcoin in Russia.
