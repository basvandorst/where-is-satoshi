I doubt that is the case, people seem to either dismiss bitcoin as a scam or look at it with a curiosity.

I have heard 'a whole bunch of addresses' twice, what order of magnitude?  1 thousand or 1 million?

First of all whatever WoT is, it clearly is worthless and doesn't work, (yet? right now?).  Second, what interest rate might be trustworthy? Probably not 3300% per year.  If you have an investment like that let me know, I will check your web of trust rating and get back to you.

Putting a donation address is tacky

Exactly, if the ransom was a real threat, why make the address publicly available? Then everyone will see if the ransom was payed.

I would say cash is not simple if it is not backed by anything.

Interesting information, report back your findings, you may be one of only a handful of people in your exact scenario

Not sure what that has to do with cash being complicated.  The idea of cash is simple, and if it is an IOU for gold, which is how cash started, that is still simple, but my point was that modern cash has shifting value and is not transparent.  Bitcoin is complicated, but it complexity is all up front.

Exactly, he left keys unencrypted.  That is a huge red flag, it should have been the second thing to implement after passwords.

Complacency and apathy over the USA's finances by its own politicians brought it here, and it may be the same thing that allows bitcoin to gain critical mass. The big thing standing in the way is the private banks' lobbying.  It is entirely possible though that private financial companies such as banks and hedge funds see constant appreciation in value as a wise investment and have a polarized stance on it.   If there isn't swift and definitive action to stamp it out and divert its adoption, then it will take hold and it's game over, bitcoin is legit because of reliable ways of converting spend it and convert it.

don't trust anyone offering 7% a month EDIT: a week

It might stimulate the economy of a country by making everything foreign more expensive, therefore increasing local spending.

If he really wanted the ransom he would send multiple addresses and have smaller payments made to each of them.
@_date: 2012-09-06 04:22:13
That is brilliant, a high profile btc address with a cause behind it.
My thought was that this was someone simply advocating bitcoins (as a cause or to raise their exchange rate) by making a claim that would get news coverage and put the word 'bitcoin' in front of the average person.

If you are so scared of a key logger, don't type your password in sequentially, use your mouse to skip to different positions. If you are paranoid beyond that, run a bootable image off a hardware encrypted USB drive.
