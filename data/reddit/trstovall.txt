Here's an alternative:
Get 4" of 1 1/4" steel pipe.  Draw lines to divide the pipe into 8 rings, and divide each ring into 8 sectors.  Now you have 256 squares which are approximately 1/2" x 1/2".  Then, for each bit of a 256-bit seed, if the bit is set, drill a 1/4" hole in the corresponding square.  Finally, mark the start bit by filing a notch in the side of the first sector.
For fewer holes but longer pipe, drill a hole in one sector of each ring, encoding three bits per ring.

The device decouples transaction creator from payment sender.  Sure, you still need Internet access to verify the funds can be claimed, but you can then use it for payment without creating a new Bitcoin transaction.
It does need more development to prevent the forgery attack, but it is a nice proof of concept to use with small amounts.

It's one thing to trust that ownership is authentically transferred.  If my coins get stolen, despite my best efforts to secure them, then crypto isn't for me, either because the crypto is too hard, or it's broken.  People know that their coins have been stolen if someone else spends them.
It's something else entirely to trust crypto for verifying the money supply.  If someone creates coins out of nothing due to a bug, collision, or just misplaced trust, then I want to know about it.  CT doesn't provide that.  This gives unlimited power to any person who can find a way to break the crypto, because he can steal through inflation, and nobody can know.

No, you don't need to assume.  It's no longer a cost of mining, but of heating (separate concerns).


You would be surprised how ubiquitous electric heating is in the southern US.  Even in the summer months, electric heating is being used for heating water.  In the winter months of Japan, electric heated blankets go a long way in keeping people warm.


Why would you need so many units, especially if they aren't being useful?  Simply, use the equipment you have to estimate a fair price for BTC and buy or sell based on that.


Sure.  But let the market sort that out.  It's entirely likely you can buy retired hardware from large miners at a huge discount.  Since you are using the waste heat as a byproduct, you don't need cutting edge mining chips anyway.


Yes, that is exactly the right question.  Decentralization and whatnot.

LN is no different than the current banking system.  Is that centralized?
Sidechains are just altcoins with a currency pegged to BTC.  Who maintains that peg?  IIRC, Elements uses a federated peg.  If that isn't centralized, then why use Bitcoin instead of Open Transactions?  It certainly isn't for performance.  Even bitBTC is more decentralized than Elements, and it has a senate controlling it.
Sure, the development teams for altcoins are small, but there're nearly a billion different altcoins.  So, there's a lot of developers out there trying some cool stuff, and who aren't stuck on "consensus", whatever that means.
Lastly, altcoins can take a lot of the weight off the network, which is actually a good thing, because it allows developers to try some interesting things.  Unfortunately, if you are heavily vested in a fixed supply currency, this is only something to fear, and the community becomes isolated.

- You've over-quoted the hash rate by a factor of 1000.
- Space heaters have 1-2 orders of magnitude lower upfront cost than heat pumps.
- Heat pumps are 2-3 times more efficient, but the quality of heat may be terrible.  50F may be 100 degrees warmer than the outside air, but it's not warm air.
- Space heaters are for heating local spaces, not bulk air.  Heating is actually *more* efficient when space heaters are paired with heat pump central heating.  I've lost the source (DoE?), but the basic idea is to heat your house to ~60F/15C.  Then, use space heaters to finish heating the areas you're in frequently.

It would indeed need to be unconditionally sound to address my concern.  But, that really only describes part of the system.  When a cryptographic primitive is integrated into a system, it inherits the security of that system.  
Think of SSL Heartbleed (that sounds like a naval vessel).  The cryptography wasn't broken, but the system was.  Could CT allow a bug in Bitcoin greater to be smuggled past unconditionally sound inflation control?  I honestly don't know, but I suspect the answer to be yes.

Consider, *n* as the number of users.  The number of transactions is O(an) where *a* is the average number of transactions per user.  The number of nodes is O(bn) where *b* is the portion of users who run full nodes.
Because *a* and *b* are both functions of the block size, if block size is constant, then we can simplify O(abn^(2)) to O(n^(2)).
The real discussion is for when block size is not constant (limit removed or kept higher than block size).  What are the functions a(s) and b(s) for block size *s*, and what is the optimum block size for scalability and decentralization?

I think that each developer should have his own coin, and a coin should only have multiple developers if those developers share the same vision and approach.

An intelligent miner will prefer network connections which most increase it's connectivity to the mining network.  This creates a topology where a large miner can easily create a large block which propagates quickly to most miners but slowly to the rest.  
The large miner then targets a block size such that the resulting stale hashes from miners with the lowest connectivity is greater than the large miner's orphan risk.  The victim miners must either eat the profit loss from the stale hashes, participate in a connectivity race, or drop out.
Essentially, with large blocks a connectivity problem arises which is equivalent to the one in high frequency trading.
@_date: 2015-05-23 08:52:56
One would expect miner A with hash rate HA to have twice the budget for connectivity than miner B with hash rate HB = 0.5HA.  Suppose miner A buys twice the bandwidth than B, but at a slight discount since he is buying more.  Can he not just use that discount to pay for the orphan risk?

This really is what Bitcoin needs.  It's terrible that so much of the conversation in this thread is unrelated to your suggestion.  They read the word demurrage and immediately thought Freicoin, then hit 'reply'.
This would not turn Bitcoin into Freicoin.  The fee would simply scale with the time the TX spent in the UTXO set (and the corresponding resources consumed).  It wouldn't scale with the balance of the TX like Freicoin.
This would be a more effective miner fee than the current fee system.  Even better would be to combine the current flat fee with the demurrage you suggest.
I would structure the fee system as a flat fee to create a UTXO and a demurrage fee to claim the UTXO.  Then, both spammers and squatters end up paying the cost of the resources they consume.  Also, one fee could be burned and the other rewarded to miners, or similarly as mentioned elsewhere.

No, there would be the XT network and the Core network.  You wouldn't be arbitrarily switching between the two.  Yes, it could be messy if your coins could also be claimed on the other network, but, code can easily be added to the new fork to make transactions chain dependent.


You don't understand network effect in Bitcoin.  It grows as nlogn, not n^2.  But, effort does grow at n^2.  The two curves intersect twice, and the optimum network size is between the two.  I would estimate it being within an order of magnitude of 1M participants.

Actually, that could introduce enough additional orphan risk to allow a company to come in and guarantee transactions.  
Technically, they would sustain a Sybil attack on the network, refusing to relay blocks and transactions which contradict their guarantees.  Then, any double spends that slip past them could be covered by insurance.

You wouldn't want to increase block size in the same fork, at least not much.  Decreasing block period and increasing block size share the effect of disproportionately increasing the orphan risk for small miners/pools.  One at a time, man!
Have you looked much into weighted median calculation?  You may want to consider allowing the network to vote on block size.  Allow each person (or UTXO) to vote on a value weighted proportionate to bitcoin balance.  
Weighted median would be a very robust measure of the network's desired block size.  Also, this would replace the projected series of hard forks with ballots, perhaps even a ballot every block.

EdDSA is really intuitive.  Signatures are just a linear equation:
S = a1 + a2 * m
Where m is the hash of the signed message, and the coefficients are private keys.  So, verification just uses distribution.  Just publish the public keys A1 and A2 (where A = a*B, and B is the well known base point of the curve), and S can be verified by the equation:
S*B = A1 + A2 * m
This is ideal for cryptocurrency, too.  Efficient multisig, fast batch (block) verification, and several other nice properties.

I fear that zero-conf promotes monopoly, giving a large advantage to first movers.
The research and experience of managing zero-conf risk is a large portion of the Shapeshift venture's capital.  A new Bitcoin business can provide a service while tuning risk and fee rate, without operating at a loss.

From what I can tell, the "old" Coinbase (CB) is for exchanging BTC/USD.  The CB exchange is for CB-BTC/CB-USD.  That is, the trading on the exchange is done off-block chain for speculators, while the "old" CB is for moving USD to/from banks and BTC to/from private wallets.
The exchange allows CB to source BTC liquidity, and so it has lower fees.

Actually, BTC is the only legal tender accepted by the Bitcoin block chain, much like USD is necessary for paying US taxes.  So, it derives it's value in much the same way as USD.
On intrinsic value, well it's good that it isn't intrinsically valuable.  Suppose that the intrinsic value of a currency suddenly changes (ie it is discovered that gold causes/cures cancer), then the economy built around that currency would come crashing down.  But that cannot happen to Bitcoin, because it is not based on some idea of intrinsic value.  The only thing that could kill Bitcoin would be it's rigidly enforced monetary policy.

Typically, only one, but with N nodes in the network, the block has to pass through log(N) nodes in series before it reaches all of the nodes in the network.  This becomes an issue when two blocks are pushed to the network close to the same time.  Then, a slower confirmed block has a clear disadvantage.  Yet, that's the goal of the soft fork.
If this soft fork caught on among full nodes, then home miners would be quick to adopt it as well, as they strongly depend on full nodes to increase their fanout (and chances of having their blocks accepted).
I highly suspect that if you implement this standard, then it would have a good chance of widespread adoption, eventually.

You overestimate the anonymity of paper cash.  Any guess as to how many hands a $20 note passes through between banks?  I would assume &amp;lt; 3, on average.  
That is, the bank hands you a $20, you spend it at the store, and the store deposits it in the bank.  As each note has a serial number, the bank could link sender account - note - recipient account for a cost of ~24-32 bytes.  
That's so cheap that pretty soon you could see banks publishing almost all paper cash transactions in a block chain.

Thanks.  That's an interesting video.  I was asking rhetorically, though.
GHOST isn't much of a real world solution, though.  To see why I say this, consider if the block period was reduced to 1 second.  GHOST consensus wouldn't converge, and may actually diverge faster than longest chain selection.
Sure, we aren't considering reducing block period to 1 second, but where is the threshold where consensus turns to chaos?  10 sec, 1 min, 5 min?  I do think that GHOST would strengthen Bitcoin, but only if we are certain that the block period is long enough.
Yet, both approaches remain highly dependent on network topology.  The Sybil attack I described exploits that in the case where block time is close to that chaos threshold.

If you put running a node out of reach of the home node operator, then decentralization would be a lost cause.  The market would very quickly push out any competitors to the most efficient payment processor.
The notion that the average home node operator would need to process every transaction in the world is absurd.  There will be many networks (coins) so that each network needs only to process a small fraction of the world's transactions.
Unfortunately, the fixed monetary supply of Bitcoin has created so much resistance to this eventuality.

I have to be honest; I read the comments and replied before reading the post.
CT + Coinjoin has the potential to provide perfect fungibility.  However, CT relies on the hardness of discrete logarithms to maintain inflation control.  Also, it seems incompatible with stakeholder voting schemes for controlling network parameters.
I have a [vaporware/manifesto whitepaper]( which makes an attempt at providing perfect fungibility, where balances are maintained in cleartext.  I would like your review, if you are interested.
It essentially uses EdDSA merged signatures to provide native Coinjoin and coin denominations to provide resistance to balance-based Coinjoin analysis.
Example:  Alice sends Bob 1 BTC using signature S = X + Y.R, where X is Alice's public key and Y.R is a hash (of Bob's public key concatenated with the message "1BTC") multiplied by verification public key R.  Let Carol send Dave 1 BTC, likewise.  The two signatures can be verified as S = S0 + S1 = X0 + X1 + Y0.R0 + Y1.R1.  If only the merged signature is published, then it is cryptographically hard to determine if Alice sent to Bob or Dave, and if Carol sent to Bob or Dave.

Gold is actually terrible for computer chips.  It's electrical conductivity is worse than copper.  It was briefly used in chips, because copper "poisons" silicon, but new means of applying copper in chips made gold irrelevant.
There is some use for gold in electronics like contact points of HDMI cables, because gold is inert making exposed contacts work longer.  But, the price of gold makes even that application prohibitively expensive.  I'll bet that's why it's $1.99 for cables on newegg vs $40.99 at Walmart.

I assumed the controversy had to do with hard vs soft fork.  
As an aside, it seems that hard forks would be less controversial since it requires consensus among users to move to the new fork, whereas soft forks are decided only by developers and a majority of hashing power.  An argument could be made that using hashing power to decide protocol allows for a simpler user experience.  Really, it is a corruption of the process designed for syncing clients, and is a call for users to defer the responsibility of determining monetary policy.  Perhaps, it says something about the political agility of Adam Back et al to use a soft fork, and the idealism of Gavin to use a hard fork.
If hard forks are so distasteful, the developers could release a client that automatically updates, like modern web browsers.  That could be a hardfork to end all hardforks.  Actually, I think something similar was proposed by a Core dev recently.  Peter Todd, maybe?

This would be a denial of service attack, but not that effective.  The saboteur and sabotaged would be expending the same amount of resources.   Also, it is unlikely that a miner would stop its current mining work until it has received the full block and verified it.  So, it wouldn't impact mining.  However, it may slightly delay receiving a legitimate block from a different miner.
A more successful attack would be to flood the miner with invalid transactions.  This would consume both bandwidth and CPU.  However, there are some controls in place to mitigate this.
Contrary to what some others have said, if an attacker were to attempt this, it would not be with a valid block.  The attacker would be senseless to bet losing a block it mined on an attack such as this.  Invalid blocks, on the other hand, would be cheap to generate.

Ideally, the number of nodes scales with the number of users.  The nodes hold the power, and increasing the number of users without increasing number of nodes distributes power disproportionately.
Ignoring that, the work required by each node scales linearly, O(n), with the number of users, n.  Yet, increasing the number of users has diminishing returns, O(log n), since social networks follow a power law distribution.  So, at some point, the cost of increasing the number of users outpaces the benefits.

Actually, if the price *decreases* then it is price deflating.  Otherwise, and in general the change is referred to as inflation.


Who taught you mathematics?
I was trying to keep things simple by assuming the rate of change of demand stays constant.  Let's go a bit further.
Now:  I1 = D1 - M1
Soon:  I2 = D2 - M2
Hence, the change inflation I2-I1 = D2 - D1 - M2 + M1 = D2 - D1 + (M1)/2.  Since, we could both argue that demand will increase or that demand will decrease, let's assume that demand does not change (D2 = D1) due to halving.  Then the change in price inflation is simply half of the pre-halving monetary inflation, (M1)/2.
I don't know the actual numbers, but let's suppose M1 = 6%/year.  Then, the post-halving price inflation will be 3%/year more.  That's a substantial increase, but "quite modest" relative to the often perceived 100% to 1,000,000% instant increase in price inflation (facetiously speaking).

That large volume is the result of many buys and sells for the same bitcoin in a short period.  You can't compare the two.
I do agree, though, that the halving's affect on price is extremely overestimated.  The price inflation of BTC, I, is determined by how much the demand growth, D, exceeds monetary inflation rate, M.  So, I = D - M.  The halving cuts M in half.  So, the new price inflation of (D - M/2) works out to be quite modest.

The main benefit of altcoins is their small size.  This means it is less costly to run a node and send payments to others in that coin.  Meanwhile, you are easily able to send payments to those not accepting your coin directly by going through an exchange.  Finally, you are able to play a larger role in development and direction.
Obviously, it can be a risky position, particularly if you are not a developer.  For some, though, the benefits outweigh the risk.

It is simple, really.  It is just as you describe--independence and control.  This is perfectly illustrated by the split into Core and XT.
Gavin and Mike believe that the block size limit needs to be raised for Bitcoin to succeed.  They can and should be able to run software which is independent of Core.
Others believe that high transaction rates destroy Bitcoin's store of value and/or harm its decentralized execution.  They can and should be able to run software which limits transaction rates (and is independent of XT).
I personally refuse to run either of these, and believe that Bitcoin's fixed supply is a fatal flaw.  The fixed supply is also to blame for the maximalism so often expressed by this sub.

No, I won't believe that.  It's your type of thinking that hastens the bifurcation between the rich and the poor.  You want to hype the value of investing by discrediting the store of value of money.
If we invest in the same thing and you have twice what I have to invest, then you are rewarded twice what I am.  However, it costs us the same to research the quality of the investment.
Meanwhile, that inflation driving us to invest is outpacing wages.  So, I'm not only getting beaten by leveraged investors, but cost of living is rising.
