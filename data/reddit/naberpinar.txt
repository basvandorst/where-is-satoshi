I bought the coins relativelty higher price when btc was above 15k
Now there is a bearish movement and I expect it to be as low as 9k
And the eth around 400 all others coins lower prices...
What shall i do? shall I sell from 13k and get in from 9k again?
Sell will mean all of my portfolio will be sold/bought again

Dedinitely they will be over rich by time.
So many couldnt take any piece from these happening now...
There are so many people without access to internet in this world and these cyrtpots make them even poorer!
Unfortunately the ones with low education and income are far far behind...
They will become poorer
And poorer
Thanks to this system!:!!:
What do you want to do with your millions?
Shall it be invested indevelopment and empoverment of these people?
This is not a system to corrupt the american millioneres 
It is just an attempt to get their weathl reduce theirs and take it to YOURS
I ve seen enough vidoes of traders aiming lambo’s

Thx well I dont know for sure but the graphs show head shoulder 
But I will hoDl as it kinda stabilized in this leve and buying 14.5k and13,5k shall not make a big difference
Selling and waiting for 9k is another risk which includes losses

I am not fudder, i stepped in with a high price not with a few hundred dollars (100$) like many of you here...
Then I would have had nothing much to loose
Of course we will sell to avoid loss...
I am rational.
