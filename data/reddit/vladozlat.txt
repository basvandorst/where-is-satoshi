Using one wallet is not the undisputed rule for me. It just would be more convenient for me to use one good wallet. I'd be grateful if you offer some scheme on how to make process of accepting, storing, spending bitcoin secure and convenient using multiple wallets and which ones you'd prefer. Would you use wallets with debit cards?

Have you ever tried to use such cards? I mean do they really work as simple and easy like they say - like usual bank card?

Maybe you could tell us a bit more in details about your past year you lived on bitcoin. I mean more information on how do you buy groceries for example or fuel a car and etc, what was the most difficult to buy or to pay for with bitcoin.
I think such information would be very helpfull for those who share your bitcoin lifestyle and it will help a lot to convince people who use "goat shit" start using bitcoin.

First of all I'm here not to make someone work for me but to ask for help. Whether help me or not each one decides for himself. Secondly, thank you for clarifying as well that you won't share your experience for free. Maybe it would have been wiser if you had given the pricelist for your services at the beginning so as not to waste each others time finding out who is who. Anyway thanks for the conversation

Since the security question is very important when you keep all your savings in BTC and live only on BTC, may I ask you how do you store your BTC and what wallet do you use so as not to be hacked or something like that? Desktop or web version, maybe mobile or even paper?

I see your point and agree with it but I'm not asking someone to make a decision for me and I'm not going to copy 1-to-1 your's or someone else's solution and blindly use it. I just want to collect not only the marketing information from the wallets web sites but some useful information from people who really use bitcoin wallets and is more experienced than me. The more information you get the easier to weigh all the pros and cons, minimize risks and make a decision choosing a wallet. That's my opinion

Yes I mean web wallet. I didn't quite get why are mobile wallets way better than web on your opinion? Because you can get full access to your private keys? Some of the web wallets offer the same option. Or maybe if someone stole the phone it would be much harder to get access to your funds stored in mobile wallet rather than simply steal login and password from the web wallet?

What would be your opinion if say use secure wallet like you've mentioned for storing bitcoin and online wallet for everyday spending. Some of the online wallets don't charge any fees for all transactions and offer bitcoin cards.

Has anyone tried their new wallets in fiat currencies yet? Is it possible to deposit such account with local currency bank transfer?
