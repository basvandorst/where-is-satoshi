That's the hedge you make with a loan, you're betting it will go up and agree to take on that 50$/mo liability even if it doesnt. Conversely, if you're dca-ing 50/mo and decide to stop dca-ing because bitcoin isn't going up or has gone down, then you dont really understand the point of dca-ing. You're 1 foot in 1 foot out in that case. Ideally, in either scenario, you commit to 50/mo for a given period of time in order to accumulate bitcoin. 
Yes, dca-ing is safer in that you can just decide to stop dca-ing if finances are tight, but then you ultimately couldn't afford 50/ mo for that given time period and shouldnt have even considered a loan to begin with. No one is arguing taking a loan out is the same risk profile as dca-ing, but to imply hes encouraging helpless newbies to financial ruin and is making irresponsible statements is, as I said, overly dramatic.

This is such a dramatic take. First of all, the only difference between taking a loan and going into bitcoin versus dca every x amount of time is interest on the loan. If you can afford 50 a month of bitcoin, you can afford a loan with a 50 a month payment. If bitcoin goes up he made a good call. If bitcoin goes to 0, well he can still afford 50 a month payment. Sucks but it doesn't ruin his life.

Dont even need the small little thing in your pocket. Can literally just memorize some words. They could search every cavity twice as you cross a border and get nowhere near your $1000000.

It's funny how many comments in the nba subreddit about this are in the vein of "well... his money's gone" or "what an idiot!"
