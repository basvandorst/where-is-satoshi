Idk why you got downvoted it's been piss easy to make gains buying Bitcoin with little to no strategy. I made like $40k in like six weeks...overall gain for the year was like 280%
This probably isn't a crash though because a crash would take down the exchanges.

Well I went a little crazy and put 1/5 of my portfolio, so I sold off my initial investment to recoup my investment, if sell everything, I'll have made like 280% return in like two months. That's really good, even if Bitcoin goes to the moon ($100,000), I'll still have enough to get a good return in that too. There returns are ridiculous either way.
Yeah I could have become a millionaire if I all in'd with my portfolio at the beginning of the year, but that's not really good investment strategy.
Also, making like $30+k in like two months is ridiculous.

I hope Bitcoin tanks below $9k to clear the market for a bit.

You can use regression to predict future values, that's the whole point of regression in the applied sense.
At the end of the day, what was posted was not enough for a convincing argument, in order to validate anything they would have to have created a trading strategy around this prediction and posted ex post returns. The granularity of that chart is just pathetic, this is like some AP stats shit

Whether something was a bubble or not is typically a backwards looking measurement because it is never the same set of features which beget a bubble. Bubbles would never exist rationally exist otherwise, since market controls could presumably put on place to prevent something like that.
For me this is mostly a question of what do most purchasers of Bitcoin envision it to be and what currently drives Bitcoin transactions aside from speculation. If the non speculative trading volume is increasing raoidly, I'd be more optimistic, but I'm not sure how to measure that.

The housing bubble and the dot com bubbles are vastly different though. The housing bubble destroyed real wealth for millions of Americans that were otherwise unaffiliated with the transactions occuring on some far distance exchange. The equity bubble lost speculative money from investors for the most part, there was no large scale effects to the broader populace uninvolved with technology.
In case  I don't feel an ounce of pity for anyone, the housing crisis was a lot different

Lol if I had a predictive model that worked I would never share it. I'm just surprised so many people take this chart seriously.
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:39:29
That's not how real statistics and data analysis is done unfortunately.
Regression would have zero usefulness as a technique if all it was good for was to represent past data. In fact the entire field of statistics would just be glorified accounting without the prediction aspect

Hahahahaha get fucked

You could sell of your share in Bitcoin in small chunks using algorithmic techniques as to not too adversely affect market prices. Common quant technique.

Better to have no chart then a misleading one

We are the most bountiful society by a large margin and we offer none of those things. The only country that has a shot of surpassing us in bounty also does not really offer those things either.
Uh no, I don't think college education should be free especially since so few jobs actually require it and undergrad is glorified baby sitting for most students (so like colleges ranked after the first or second page). Even in countries with 'free' college, the selection process is much more stringent in the United States. No country wants to offer education buffet style like the US left does

You don't know it will change anything, so far it's changed nothing. In talking about skin in the game so money invested. Anything else is just mental cheerleading

There was no bubble idk why people think price drop = bubble. I got into this to profit off of FOMO dumb money, I've realized a decently big gain and now I'm out. Ideas are great, but making money takes first, second, and third precedence.
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:17:32
For speculative investments? Absolutely. I think you're braindead for not thinking so.
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:00:22
Well that's great, I'm not so the only thing I care about is my speculative investment. Otherwise crypto has no value to me.

Stock market returns are actually pretty crazy right now, I've made close to 50% return within this past year. If I had put more into crypto my returns would have been through the goddamn roof. Money is money and knowledge of finance is useful when thinking about Bitcoin as an instrument.

I don't care about being nice on the internet especially not in some random ass subreddit
Do you have a blockchain company, did you post an ico? Are you a dev that made something useful to the community? If not, then the best you are is a speculator which is the extent if your involvement. Sure you can say you care about something, but with nothing riding on that statement, your position might as well be equivalent to mine. I don't buy into the fiat will be replaced crowd, those are mostly just idealistic broke bitches

I try not to care too much about stuff I don't actually have any real involvement with. That doesnt mean im ignorant or don't have an opinion, about whats going on though. That's my life philosophy and I'm pretty pleased with it. Caring in my eyes means doing, words are meaningless without action, so you might as well not care if you're not doing

Fomo -- also I think it has some fantastic use cases. I've been following Bitcoin for like 6 years. I also enjoy some speculation from time to time
