Same with Canada in BC. I'm talking about the crappy handwritten ones on lined paper you see crookedly taped to the window. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 19:31:15
You *can* tax it. The government just refuses to do so. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 18:51:30
Except that the rich make their money through investments, not a regular income. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 06:23:23
I don't know understand people who argue the point


Isn't that the case when anything is first introduced?
@_date: 2014-04-02 20:25:12
Banks aren't exactly trustworthy. One of Canada's biggest banks was named in that global interest fixing scandal. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:10:14
I'm surprised how someone like him would be so against such a concept. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 01:37:40
It was implied. You were saying a trustworthy intermediary would be good, in a thread discussing a bank that said it'd be willing to be an intermediary. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 20:29:03
He is correct. I actually had a similar response typed out and then realized the wording is just awkward. What he said is this:


@_date: 2014-03-05 17:08:28
You joke about this but the *national* news in Canada had a sentence that said bitcoin supporters say it is immune to theft (paraphrasing) on their article about Gox. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 01:38:07
That's very true...

Mark Twain said that using exclamation marks in writing is like laughing at your own jokes. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 05:27:48
And suddenly an 11 year old has more money than me...
@_date: 2014-03-03 07:13:19
I'm not sure I understand your question. Regardless, I don't follow that logic. Something is far away so it isn't desirable? What? 
@_date: 2014-04-03 01:34:30
It's similar to how putting "new driver" in your back window draws the wrath of drivers. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:30:56
And apparently some even think that it's the *only* currency, as some have tried to use it in Canada, puzzled when it's denied.
@_date: 2013-11-26 08:14:29
Isn't that literally the definition of opportunity cost?
@_date: 2013-08-25 17:53:10
We should create a team. I'm also going into the environmental industry and am interested in Berlin...
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:37:33
What about their security? I'm a little reluctant to use the smaller exchanges...
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:41:03
The answer is kind of vague, but as much as you're willing to lose. If $1000 vanishing into thin hour would distraught you, then don't invest $1000. Pick an amount you'd be okay with losing forever if it were to happen.
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:03:17
From my limited understanding, they have the strongest economy in Europe, and I would think that that would give them quite a bit of heft; as such, their endorsement could be very beneficial.
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:55:10
As someone who just inherited that much, is it a bad idea that I'm almost seriously considering that?
@_date: 2013-11-14 09:39:10
I find it most mind boggling how you can go through your entire life without coming across the fact that other countries have different currencies. It's impossible to not stumble upon something like that by accident.
Also, had a (Canadian) lady once ask me what currency Europe used. "Do they use the American dollar?"; no, no they don't...
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:37:08
If you live in Canada you can buy BTC with a debit card at quickbt.com. The fee is pretty steep, though.
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:32:00
Yeah, I forgot you can only put in approved investments. I look forward to your findings for any insight they provide.
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:35:16
Yeah, don't pay until the hard drive is found, but in exchange offer a massive sum. Something like $100,000 wouldn't be a huge hit for him, yet I feel many people would every last bit of that landfill for such a sum.
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:51:22
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:30:36
Right, I forgot about that. I figured it seemed too good to be true.
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:11:09
I actually received verification approval about an hour before your reply, but thank you for personally checking into it. I'm going to wire some money right now.
@_date: 2013-11-22 08:38:58
Why is it hard to get money into btc-e? No verification, and it says it takes 3-7 days for a wire transfer. Is there something I don't know?
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:33:08
Really lives up to his username, doesn't he?
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:17:13
That's the thing I'm wondering. If I lost it all, I wouldn't be any worse off, just have less wealth. I don't really need the money, but it would be an incredible shame to lose such a sum. On the other hand, if the value of BTC goes up even a few dollars, I'd get quite a profit; but I feel that this is me being too greedy.
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:38:25
That's a brilliant license plate. Using that for when I buy a fancy vehicle with BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:31:16
Then perhaps you should care less, as there's no guarantee of even making a profit.
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:38:58
Bitstamp is pretty much on par as far as I've seen it mentioned around these parts. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:35:33
I don't *need* it as in I have nothing tangible that I *must* to spend it on. I feel like it would be a waste to pay off my mortgage at current rates, and I don't have any other debt. I'd invest it in other stuff for retirement or whatever, but I've been watching bitcoin for a few months now and am itching to get into the game. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:31:22
I feel like promising someone a cut would attract them.
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:19:06
I submitted a question regarding verification over 24 hours and still have not heard back. I submitted verification anyways and I am hoping things go smoothly.
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:43:18
Vault of Satoshi is also quite convenient to use. They accepted a mobile phone bill as residence proof, whereas CaVirtEx did not. I didn't really have anything else so I didn't have much of a choice. The prices seem to be a bit higher on VoS, but you can do cash deposits at any BMO which is nice. The verification also took like 4 hours, which I was quite glad about.

Wil Wheaton.
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:48:59
What a hilarious technicality. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:36:43
That would defeat the purpose of kick starter. The whole point is its like startup investing for the average person. You're supposed to research proposals and back those you believe in. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:40:39
The article says the hard drive has the key to access his account. I am going to assume that means that he's the only one who knows which one it is.
