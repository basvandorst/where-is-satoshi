this has to be the most r/bitcoin post I've ever seen.
Quick leader of X company said something mean about my bitcoins. Everyone(aka no one) go grab your pitchfork and pretend they gave a fuck of Y action.

Did they not let you withdraw your coins at any point up to the fork block?
You made your own choice, now own up to it.

I've never understood this. Wouldn't an exchange getting raided help the price of BTC? Technically now there are far less BTC available than before. There are also many many more exchanges so of course well lose some and gain some.

how would you like me to do that if the site down?

Well there are a lot of flaws in many of these thoughts.
Annualized volatility is "miniuscule"( in arguments it's hard to do anything when people use subjective terms ) because of the size of that currency. This one is 5000x smaller. Naturally you'd expect more movement in price.
This thread wasn't around round last year not sure how they would predict anything.
Why the fuck are you listening or classifying anything on the internet as set in stone or facts of truth? People are just being emotional idiots because they over-invested in something they under studied.

Check the indexes for the US dollar for example:
That's over 5 years and with a ~15 trillion dollar currency.

It's too early to be assuming price stability. Come back in five years.

I don't feel comfortable giving some random app creator access to my banking credentials.

rightfully so after being hacked

Your choice, the majority of US volume is going through bitfinex at this time so the majority certainly doesn't agree with your sentiment. I happen to fall in that group too, but yeah don't store your BTC on exchanges.

You forget they are back by institutional investors and what does those people want?

Let's make sure that's the case as this protocol grows and this 'tool' is next to useless.
@_date: 2017-07-30 06:01:58
are you aware of the fees involved to do just that?
@_date: 2015-02-20 05:19:53

I know it makes you guys feel good about yourselves, but apple doesn't give a flying fuck. You are far from their target audience.
