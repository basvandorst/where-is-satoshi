any gains would be very short lived. Any miners holding coins would now hold worthless coins... also, all the equipment they have for mining would be worthless

Can someone explain this concept of tipping to me? I get bitcoin, but tipping is a bit more fuzzy.
@_date: 2014-11-20 06:11:15
that would be some insane inflation.... haha

What do you think about the possibility of doing something like a 100 to 1 "split" for bitcoins? 
I know that's somewhat against the spirit of a limited supply, but I think the high price of one bitcoin is a large psychological barrier to adoption among some people. Obviously, people have brought this up before, but in my mind, this is a huge thing holding back bitcoin adoption.

Yup, I really wish this thread would have gained more traction because it's actually a really simple idea that everyone can do that would be more productive than posting on reddit.

yup, if enough people do this (assuming unrealistic expectations), that could literally be millions of people getting their first inkling of positive exposure. Can't hurt. Thanks for the tip!

On Coinbase's site, they say that like 97% of their vault coins are stored offline. That helped me feel better about storing my coins with them, but I'm not sure if there are any other lurking risks. 
I'll look into a paper wallet, but I may not have an ultra safe place to store it until I graduate, so I may be better off with my faith in Coinbase. I'm not sure.

the ad really kills the vibe of this post

I upvoted this purely based off of the first sentence

oh, well youtube played an ad before the video... I love that song, video and band, but the ad was disappointing
