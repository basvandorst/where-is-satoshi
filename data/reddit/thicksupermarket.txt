Just keeps going down, down, down...

Who made the most last year during the Bitcoin assent? Anyone? $500? $5,000? $500,000? I got started too late and have only lost...no gains to date!
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:33:44
No, fits you better
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:06:53
Hard to hodl! At $-1000 I was uncomfortable. At $-1500 I almost got out. At $-2000 I got out and it bounced back so licked my wounds and jumped back in swearing I'd never do that again! Now down $2700!!!!! What was I thinking! So sick of just watching money go bye-bye!!

By the way some of you talk you'd think crypto has been around for years!! Video games to crypto currency.  Trade one make believe world for another...

Everyone's so angry at the 'whales' when the 'whales' were just like you 2 years ago. Sitting in their mom's basement in chat rooms, complaining about the 1%. They got lucky, BTC mooned and in a short period of time went from basement dwelling to beach living. You can always go back to playing your State Lottery! Better odds!

Wow, that long!!
@_date: 2018-03-28 04:21:53
Yeah, I've been watching post after post about going to 9000 "by EOD today".  Where are all you prophets now? Looks like it's still at 8000 to me. Just give it up, please!!!
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:01:59
This is now the norm so get used to it. Bitcoin will never 'moon' again. Think about it. You're expecting people to start buying at such a low price and eventually they will. But pay $9000, $10,000, $12,000 or $15,000. Who will pay that much? So we're stuck and will be confined to small blips moving forward.

What we're all of you doing before crypto currency? Video games?
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:39:27
Good God, do you need everything explained??? How about a nice picture book, will that help? Yes, you are correct, you don't have to buy an entire coin (BTW - you do know that there aren't REAL coins, don't you?). When the price of 1 BTC goes up it will affect the price at ALL levels of buy. Genius
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:13:19
Another American thinking everything revolves around us. The US has very little effect on BTC price.

Test - which crypto will make the greatest gain in 2018? 
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:23:35
Are people seriously asking advice? "Why yes, Bitcoin will go up tomorrow, hold steady for a day then drop again". Now go invest accordingly...

The alt coins are where the money will be made (and lost). They have a much better chance of 'mooning'. They also have a much better chance of disappearing!

I'm about to go psychopathic! These clowns (Coinbase) shouldn't be getting away with this. Im ready to drive to their headquarters and raise some hell and in dead serious. I live 2 States away and I'll jump on a plane tomorrow. I want to get about 500 people willing to do this. I'm not just spewing words! I'm sick of this BS! I just got off the phone with some punk at Coinbase scolding me for being impatient. That little turd probably makes minimum wage and I guarantee if he had 100 bucks (his life savings) in an account that he couldn't access he'd be iterate. I'm serious about this. I won't take this anymore. I will begin spreading this and all you to do the same. I want to get 500 people organized and ready to move out. We will park ourselves at their front door and force them to listen to us!
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:52:36
I'm serious about this. I typically would never do anything like this but I'm sick of being treated like this. The only way we're going to make a difference is to band together. I hope you're in with me and will start spreading the word! I was even thinking of starting a website. I think they're pretty cheap and it will be one place we can go and unify. We gotta do something about this! Please help me get the word out!
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:17:59
I can tell you with 50% surety that Bitcoin WILL go up!
